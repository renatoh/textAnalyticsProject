The Belgian has suffered two serious knee injuries and was then ruled out at the start of March by a hamstring problem, limiting the midfielder to 25 appearances. City play Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in Saturday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final, are in the Champions League quarter-finals and competing to win the Premier League, having claimed the Carabao Cup. Yet De Bruyne admits he will likely not be at his best as City pursue an unprecedented quadruple. \u201cNo, probably not,\u201d he said. \u201cNot compared with last year. I don\u2019t know what my level is going to be but to be fair I don\u2019t really care. Now it\u2019s the business end [of the year], I just need to do what I can do to help the team win games. If that means playing five games or 10 games, I\u2019ll take it all. It\u2019s been that kind of season.\u201d Despite his extended layoffs De Bruyne does not feel fresh. \u201cNo, not really,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel sometimes my season had double the length of other players because every time you need to be in, you need to make almost double the hours, you never have a day off because you need to work on your recovery. It\u2019s more draining than to play in the end. A lot of the time you\u2019re alone but you have to do it. I did it and I\u2019m happy I\u2019m back.\u201d De Bruyne is excited at the challenge ahead but warned City could lose out on the three trophies they are chasing. \u201cIt\u2019s like 12 or 13 cup games. It makes it exciting. In the end maybe we lose everything but at least we are here at this stage. It\u2019s been incredible, so just keep on going, try to win Saturday and hopefully go to another final. For me personally I\u2019ve not been there [to an FA Cup final] yet, I\u2019ve not won it.\u201d Pep Guardiola has said he will not take a risk with Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s fitness against Brighton after the striker suffered a muscle injury at Fulham. \u201cSergio is going to play when he\u2019s really, really fit,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThe doctors are going to tell me tomorrow [Saturday] if he\u2019s a risk of being injured and after that whether it could be three or four weeks out. If that is the case I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not going to play. It\u2019s a semi-final. It\u2019s an important game and we\u2019ll play with the best side possible.\u201d The manager defended Benjamin Mendy after the full-back was filmed in a club at 3.30am last week. \u201cOf course I am happy [with him],\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy, he has an incredible heart. Sometimes, I have to understand his own culture, where he has come from \u2026 It\u2019s not the first time, and will not be the last one, so it is what it is. What we want to do is work with him to protect his knee, his condition, to help us, because we need him.\u201d Guardiola, asked whether dancing in a club was good for Mendy\u2019s knee, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if he danced. I was not there. But from what I saw sometimes with his celebrations in the Premier League, he\u2019s not a bad dancer.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
