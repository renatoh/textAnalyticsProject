EBICo, the low-cost, not-for-profit, energy company, is now offering individuals and companies the chance to become carbon neutral. It effectively calculates how much CO2 is produced by a household's lifestyle/energy consumption, and then buys the equivalent on the European carbon trading market. Anyone logging on to its website - equiclimate.org - will be taken through a process to calculate how much CO2 their family's lifestyle produces. Users have the option to include the gas and electricity used in their home, the fuel consumed by their car, plus any flights taken during the year. Consumers can mix and match any or all of the above, and pay to cover either all, or part of, the CO2 produced. Those wishing to go ahead simply pay with a credit or debit card. The company uses the carbon trading scheme to match users with companies selling CO2 they have saved as a result of projects they have implemented. Until now EBICo has provided the offset service for its gas and electricity customers - however, now it is available to everyone. Managing director Phil Levermore says the domestic use of electricity and gas produces 15% of the UK's CO2 emissions, whilst road and air transport account for 18%. \"The average family heating a home, using a car and flying off on holiday once a year produces around 10 to 15 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. If they want to pay to be carbon neutral, that will cost them \u00a3100-\u00a3150. We recommend that consumers try to offset at least 20% of their footprint, which for most of us costs around \u00a320 a year.\" EBICo is currently one of, if not the cheapest, suppliers of both gas and electricity. Set up to provide those on low incomes with cheaper domestic bills, it has shot to the top of the best-buy tables as every other company increased prices. \u00b7 Go to ebico.co.uk or call 0800 458 7689."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
