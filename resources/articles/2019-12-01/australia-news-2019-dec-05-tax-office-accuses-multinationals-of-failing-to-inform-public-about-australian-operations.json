Speaking to Guardian Australia as the ATO prepares for its annual release of tax transparency data later this month, second commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn said would be \u201cwise\u201d to improve the information contained in locally filed financial reports to include details of the operations of their Australian companies. Hirschhorn also warned the big four accounting firms that the ATO was closely watching their behaviour because it regarded them as systemically important because of their role in the tax system, as auditors of big companies and as suppliers to government. Every year the ATO publishes revenue, taxable income and tax paid by large Australian subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies and big Australian companies. However, the data is difficult to reconcile with accounting information published by some of the companies. \u201cThe tax office is obliged to publish each year three numbers, which is of course a very limited perspective on a company\u2019s tax performance,\u201d Hirschhorn said. He said a number of companies \u2013 generally those \u201cwith better Australian tax performance\u201d \u2013 had also signed up to a voluntary tax transparency code that requires them to publish an annual report on the tax they have paid. \u201cSome disclosures under the VTTC are disappointing in that they have technically produced a report but do not meet the code\u2019s intent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe warning signs are companies which focus on how much tax they pay on behalf of other people, how many excises or royalties they pay and how much they\u2019ve invested in Australia, and down the back you might get a little aside about how much corporate tax they pay.\u201d He said other companies disappointed because they have signed up to the code but only published one report. \u201cThe expectation was that companies would publish every year, and we are keen to see this,\u201d he said. A third set of very large companies, with worldwide turnover of $1bn or more, are required to file annual financial reports in Australia because they are regarded as \u201csignificant global entities\u201d. \u201cThe challenge with this measure is that if you\u2019re a company that doesn\u2019t want to shed too much light on your affairs, you can produce your global accounts, and of course they\u2019re accounts which include your Australian operations, but they don\u2019t tell the Australian community much about what you did in Australia,\u201d Hirschhorn said. \u201cYou meet all the requirements technically but you\u2019ve provided no insight into your Australian operations to the Australian community. \u201cWhat Australians are actually interested in is a full picture of your Australian operations at general purpose financial statement level, and the wise company would produce that.\u201d He said some multinationals were also struggling to deal with an ATO crackdown on inbound supply chains for products they sell in Australia. The assault mirrors a successful one on the outbound version for Australia exports, so-called \u201cmarketing hubs\u201d in Singapore used by the big miners. \u201cThe industry was very happy with where things were, which in my view was systemic underbooking of profits in Australia,\u201d Hirschhorn said. He said \u201cpushback\u201d against the ATO\u2019s new harder line was \u201centirely expected\u201d. \u201cAs the administrator, we\u2019ve got to judge whether we\u2019ve overstepped \u2013 at this stage we don\u2019t think so and we\u2019re confident that our supporting analysis holds true. It can\u2019t be that large companies operate successfully in Australia over long periods, even decades, without making a profit here.\u201d Hirschhorn has also been tackling the big four accounting firms \u2013 Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and EY \u2013 by travelling to their offices with a blunt warning that they need to improve their behaviour. For the past year, the ATO has been locked in battle with tax partners at the big four, especially over what it sees as the misuse of legal professional privilege to shield tax minimisation schemes from exposure. Industry sources say the dispute is likely set to boil over into the courts in the new year in legal action the ATO is believed to be contemplating against a handful of practitioners with whom it has so far been unable to resolve its differences. The ATO\u2019s efforts have also come amid renewed scrutiny of the roles of the big four firms. A parliamentary committee is currently inquiring into standards in financial audits, which have been consistently criticised by the corporate regulator and at the big end of town are dominated by the big four. The role of the accounting giants has also been under scrutiny in large-scale corporate collapses and alleged frauds including UK outsourcing giant Carillion and Malaysia\u2019s 1MDB scandal. \u201cIf you are systemically important, in any of those but especially if you are systemic across multiple lenses, you must behave differently from being a boutique, which really can just live in a system rather than be an integral part of the system,\u201d Hirschhorn said. He said systemically important firms had to realise that they could not get away with the same actions as boutique firms because the system as a whole would respond to their movements. \u201cThe corollary of that is that a systemically important firm brings great opportunities and strengths, but must be more careful and wiser \u2013 some superficially successful businesses may fall outside the parameters of a systemically important firm,\u201d he said. He said it was difficult for big firms to realise this because of their roots \u201cas amalgamations of smaller firms and add-on practices\u201d. \u201cTraditionally each partner or small group of partners was given a high degree of autonomy and the firms were not necessarily very good at judging the risk-adjusted returns of those businesses,\u201d he said. He said the ATO\u2019s message had resonated with managing partners. \u201cMy impression is the senior leaders in the firms are thinking deeply on these issues, not just in their tax businesses, and it reinforces their efforts in managing their firms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are certainly seeing the senior leaders take concrete action.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
