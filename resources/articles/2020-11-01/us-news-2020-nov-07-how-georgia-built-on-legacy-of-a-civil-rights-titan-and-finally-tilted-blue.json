The city worried that the president might unleash his well-armed supporters against an unfavourable result or that Trump\u2019s opponents might turn out in protest if Georgia\u2019s Republican establishment got up to its old shenanigans of fixing elections. But as the counting dragged on, the streets stayed quieter than usual, although coronavirus had already taken its toll on city life. When the results finally began to put Joe Biden in the lead in Georgia, his supporters held off on the celebrations. This was the wrong year to tempt fate. But there was a lot of quiet satisfaction that a state whose most significant role in presidential elections until now was as the home of Jimmy Carter, the 39th president, might prove instrumental in the toppling of the US president. \u201cI\u2019m glad I voted. Didn\u2019t last time but we needed rid of that guy. I\u2019m proud of Georgia!\u201d said Martin Williams, on his way to work at a fast food restaurant an otherwise empty city street early Saturday morning. That is a widely held sentiment among Trump\u2019s opponents who sometimes cast his defeat \u2013 although a recount was announced on Friday \u2013 in terms of a sweet revenge in a state he won by five points in 2016. After trailing for days in the Georgia count, Biden was finally tipped into winning territory by votes from Clayton County, represented in Congress for years by the civil rights titan John Lewis, a fierce critic of Trump who died in July. \u201cI love the idea that Clayton County could put Biden over in GA. That\u2019s John Lewis\u2019 district. He would do one of his trademark happy dances in heaven. Symmetry,\u201d former Senator Claire McCaskill tweeted. Ben Crump, the lawyer who represents the families of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other African Americans killed by police, tweeted a reference to Lewis\u2019s mantra of causing \u201cgood trouble\u201d in the fight for rights. \u201cCould this be John Lewis looking down and giving Trump \u2018Good Trouble\u2019? This is ALL thanks to YOU, the Black vote, for flipping this historically red state,\u201d he wrote. There is little doubt that the black vote was instrumental in deciding the outcome in a state with a long history of subverting the voting rights of African Americans and where the Confederate battle flag still decorates many rural porches. If any one person can be credited with delivering the blow against Trump it is Stacey Abrams, the former candidate for state governor who took her revenge on the Republican establishment for, as many in Georgia see it, stealing that election. In response, she mobilised a cadre of voters to make sure it couldn\u2019t happen again, and that has paid off for Biden. Abrams would have become the first black female governor in the US had she been elected two years ago. She lost by just 55,000 votes and has never conceded that race, saying an \u201cerosion of our democracy\u201d deprived supporters of their right to vote. Her opponent, Brian Kemp, used his position as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state to remove more than 300,000 people from the voters roll, many on the grounds that they had not voted in three years in the kind of voter suppression that has become a hallmark of some Republican-run states. Kemp also refused to recuse himself from overseeing the election he was running in. \u201cMore than 200 years into Georgia\u2019s democratic experiment, the state failed its voters,\u201d Abrams said after the election. \u201cEight years of systemic disenfranchisement, disinvestment and incompetence had its desired effect on the electoral process in Georgia.\u201d Abrams, who Biden considered as his vice-presidential running mate, responded by building on her work to register new voters and fight voter suppression through a network of groups that raised tens of millions of dollars. She recognised the shifting demographics of Georgia and focused part of her campaign on what were once almost exclusively white suburbs of cities such as Atlanta but are now home to a black middle class that has grown significantly in recent years. Supporters credit Abrams with generating hundreds of thousands of new voter registrations, particularly among minorities and those who rarely went to the polls \u2013 plenty more than the few thousand Biden now leads by in Georgia. One of Abrams\u2019 groups, Fair Fight Action, sued in a federal court to stop Republicans purging voters, winning the reinstatement of 22,000 people to the rolls. \u201cI, for one, feel she would be our governor if it were not for the rampant voter suppression tactics,\u201d Nikema Williams, the state\u2019s Democratic party chair, told the New York Times. \u201cThe work that she did in organising people on the ground, in coalition with other progressive organisations, was critical to building the infrastructure in this state.\u201d On Tuesday, that organising helped elect Williams to the Congressional seat previously held by Lewis. It also paid off for Biden. Abrams tweeted her delight at the result, saying: \u201cMy heart is full.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
