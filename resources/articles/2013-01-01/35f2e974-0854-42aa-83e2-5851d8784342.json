Not making the list: the \u00a3100m Premier League clubs spend on wages every 22 days. \u2022 Last week's wages highlights: 1) Arsenal upping Theo Walcott's deal to \u00a3100k a week plus \u00a33m for loyalty, four months after chairman Peter Hill-Wood took a stand. \"We're not prepared to break our wage structure for anybody, and that's the end of it. The whole issue of pay for footballers has got totally out of hand.\" 2) QPR's \u00a322.5m fee-plus-salary deal for Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my \u2013 agreed 16 months after owner Tony Fernandes set out to change the game. \"Football needs change. There are clubs out there spending money that, if they were in a real business, they could not afford. This isn't the black hole of Calcutta.\" \u2022 Reactions to the R\u00e9my deal: a) Harry Redknapp \u2013 modifying December's pledge to help protect QPR from more big wages (\"I don't want to see the owners have their pants taken down like they have in the past\") to: \"I'm delighted. The chairman worked ever so hard.\" b) QPR's chief executive Philip Beard on what convinced R\u00e9my to sign: \"This move isn't motivated by money. Lo\u00efc has a passion and desire to achieve.\" c) And the external verdict: \"I'm surprised to see R\u00e9my go to QPR instead of Newcastle. I'd have a good guess that financial things had a part to play.\" \u2013 Alan Shearer (Blackburn, 1992-96). Meanwhile Helping define the week: Manchester United's PR team \u2013 naming Japanese paint maker Kansai as United's Official Paint Partner. Kansai join other United sponsors including Official Savoury Snack Partner Mister Potato, Official Noodles Partner Mamee, and Smirnoff \u2013 Official Responsible Drinking Partner. Politician of the week Former Bulgaria midfielder Yordan Lechkov. 2003: Says he'll bring his experience of the football family into the political arena after being elected mayor of Sliven. 2013: Jailed for two years for fraud relating to a sewerage deal, plus \"pressuring a tax official\". \u2022 Also bridging the gap: the former Juventus director Luciano Moggi, 75 \u2013 now a confirmed candidate for this year's elections in Piedmont. The Berlusconi-supporting Riformisti Italiani party say Moggi, still appealing his prison sentence for match-fixing, is standing as \"a symbol of our battle against the circus of media and judges who ruin lives and careers\". Lazy journalism Also bemused by the circus: Paraguay's FA head Nicol\u00e1s Leoz, 84 \u2013 unhappy after German press alleged he took a bribe to vote for Qatar 2022. Leoz, who denies separate bribery claims related to Fifa's ISL scandal, told local media: \"A while ago the press in England were at it, now the German press do it. I don't know, what is it that drives these people?\" Moving on 1) 12 Jan: Saudi FA head Ahmed Eid Al-Harbi says press reports about coach Frank Rijkaard are \"caustic\". \"Rijkaard stays. Everyone just needs to be rational, especially the media. Rijkaard will lead a new generation.\" 13 Jan: Saudi prince Nawaf bin Faisal offers to cover the \u20ac3m penalty clause it would cost to sack Rijkaard. 16 Jan: Rijkaard sacked. 2) 3 Jan: Sevilla president Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda del Nido on coach M\u00edchel. \"The coach's job is not on the line. I see him with all the strength and ability to take the team on. In the club's hierarchy, the buck stops with me. We'll find solutions together.\" 14 Jan: Sacks him. Deep thinker of the week Uruguay: Nacional keeper Jorge Bava \u2013 reacting to riot police entering the pitch to shield the referee by punching one of them in the face. FA president Sebasti\u00e1n Bauz\u00e1: \"There are some lines that should not be crossed.\" Team-mate Andr\u00e9s Scotti says Bava, held by police overnight, was misunderstood. \"We're all backing you Jorge. He's only human.\" New leaf Montpellier president Louis \"Loulou\" Nicollin, self-moderating his response to Fenerbahce's bid for Youn\u00e8s Belhanda: \"They wanted to pay us in three installments! What a wonderful idea. They can keep their installments and shove them up \u2026 that place I am thinking of.\" Love news Brazil: Internacional's Andr\u00e9s D'Alessandro on his new branded D'Ale10 fashion shirts \u2013 part of his \"growing D'Ale10 range\" including D'Ale10 chewing gum, dolls and school supplies. \"All this helps me get close to my fans. I'm just trying to give back the love I receive.\" Plus: unconcerned Dietmar Hamann, asked by German paper Bild if Sven-Goran Eriksson's nickname in the German press would put him off a job coaching there. \"Oh he's over it. Being called Horny Sven doesn't worry a man like him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
