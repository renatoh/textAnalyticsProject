Did anyone expect otherwise? On a balmy Glasgow night Hampden went barmy for Usain Bolt. Every stride, gesture, breath: oohs, ahs, noise. He was sheepish when stepping on to the track, a dark Jamaican hoodie providing monkish anonymity, but the world\u2019s most famous athlete\u2019s disguise lasted only seconds before he was recognised. His first performance on the track in almost 11 months was recognisably Bolt too. Taking the baton on the anchor leg of the second 4x100m relay heat of the night, he was level with the Nigerian Mark Jelks after Bolt\u2019s team-mate Kimmari Roach had cramped on the opening leg. A sharp opening of the throttle changed that. Bolt led Jamaica to victory, easing down, in 38.99sec. Afterwards Bolt, after three days of silence, denied that he had ever told the Times that these Games were a \u201cbit shit\u201d.Instead there was effusive praise for the event, which was \u201cwonderful\u201d; for Glasgow, which he described as \u201cgreat\u201d; and for his \u201cbrilliant\u201d reception from 40,000 people in the stadium. \u201cI felt like I was at the London Olympics,\u201d he said. \u201cI love competing in front of a crowd that is really loud so it was just brilliant. Everything\u2019s been great apart from the weather.\u201d Stiffer tests will await in Saturday\u2019s final, with the Bahamian and English teams looking impressively smooth in winning their heats, but as always one expects Bolt to have the final say. But the biggest roar of the night \u2013 and the bravest performance \u2013 came from the Scottish 800m runner Lynsey Sharp, who somehow claimed silver behind the Kenyan world champion, Eunice Sum, despite throwing up all night. \u201cThis means so much with all the obstacles I\u2019ve been through,\u201d said Sharp, who has struggled with injuries and operations for the last two years and at one point even considered switching to cycling. \u201cLast night I went out for dinner because I thought it was just the food in the village I wasn\u2019t enjoying,\u201d she said. \u201cI ordered a \u00a320 steak, it came to the table I was like \u2018I can\u2019t eat that\u2019. I got back to the village, threw up for a few hours. [British athletes coach] Steve Maguire took me over to the clinic and I was there until 5.30 this morning on a drip. So I didn\u2019t eat. All I\u2019ve eaten is porridge and scrambled egg.\u201d Was she going to pull out? \u201cYeah. At 2.30 in the morning I had compression socks on and I couldn\u2019t bend over to take them off. It was so bad. I was like \u2018how the hell am I going to be able to run if I can\u2019t bend over to take my socks off\u2019. But somehow another miracle. \u201cThere are two things I\u2019ll never forget. One is being on my hands and knees being sick outside my room with the nurse holding my hair back, Steve standing there and four police officers walking away at the sound of me being sick. And being doubled over trying to take my socks off while Steph Twell was asleep in the room.\u201d On her right hand Sharp had written four words: Get Out Strong Commit. She could have added two more, borrowed from the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy: Don\u2019t Panic. Having been boxed in with 150m to go she pulled out to go first past Jessica Judd, who finished fourth, and then the Ugandan Winnie Nanyondo, who won bronze. There have been many gutsy performances in these Games but surely Sharp\u2019s efforts top the lot. Meanwhile England\u2019s Steve Lewis completed a set of Commonwealth medals with gold in the pole vault. Lewis, who won bronze in Melbourne and silver in Delhi, beat his compatriot Luke Cutts by clearing 5.55m in a jump-off. However, in the 100m hurdles, Tiffany Porter was unable to catch the Australian golden girl, Sally Pearson, and had to settle for silver behind the Olympic champion. Silver was also the colour for Isobel Pooley, who cleared a lifetime best of 1.92m to come second to the 18-year-old Australian Eleanor Patterson in the high jump. Afterwards Pooley admitted she could not bear to watch other athletes failing at 1.89m. \u201cMaybe when I am a more mature athlete I won\u2019t have to stick my fingers in my ears and go \u2018la la la la\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to hear what was going on. I think a lot of people probably thought I was crazy walking around with my hands clamped over my ears singing stupid songs, but it worked.\u201d In the women\u2019s discus Jade Lally, a 27-year-old personal trainer from London, won bronze behind Australia\u2019s Dani Samuels with a season\u2019s best of 60.48m. Lally\u2019s father once built a discus circle to Olympic specifications in a local farm to allow her to practise. She has trained alongside sheep, cows and llamas. This night made it worthwhile. The longest race of the night, the men\u2019s 10,000m final, came down to a thrilling photo-finish with 0.09sec separating the top three. Uganda\u2019s Moses Kipsiro held off the Kenyan Josphat Bett to win in 27.56.11. And there was also a surprise of sorts in the men\u2019s 3,000m steeplechase as the unfancied Kenyan Jonathan Ndiku crossed the line first in a Commonwealth Games record of 8:10.44 ahead of Jairus Birech, who has run the three fastest times in 2014, and the two-time Olympic champion Ezekiel Kemboi."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
