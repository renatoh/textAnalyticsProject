A person close to the matter who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity said Mueller\u2019s team and the bank had already established informal contact in connection to the federal investigation. There were signs this week that any effort by Mueller to to pursue documents about Trump\u2019s personal finances will be met with intense criticism by the White House. When asked by the New York Times whether he believed Mueller would be crossing a red line if he expanded his inquiry to include an examination of Trump\u2019s personal finances, the president said: \u201cI think that\u2019s a violation.\u201d Deutsche\u2019s relationship with Trump and questions about hundreds of millions in loans have dogged the German bank and the White House for months. They have also been the subject of intense scrutiny among some Democrats on Capitol Hill, who have demanded the bank turn over detailed information about the president\u2019s accounts. The requests for information from Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House financial services committee, have focused on whether any Russian entities may have provided financial guarantees for the loans that were made to the president or his immediate family members. The Guardian reported in February that the bank launched a review of Trump\u2019s account earlier this year in order to gauge whether there were any suspicious connections to Russia and did not discover anything suspicious. Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and adviser in the White House; her husband, Jared Kushner, who is also a presidential adviser; and Kushner\u2019s mother, Seryl Stadtmauer, are all clients of Deutsche Bank. US media outlets have reported that Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign will include a close examination of the president\u2019s finances and businesses. While Deutsche Bank did engage in banking transactions with Russian banks as late as 2005, including some loan activity, a person familiar with the matter said the activity was not related to Trump\u2019s accounts or his family. The president has decried the investigation into his campaign as \u201cfake news\u201d and has vociferously denied that the campaign ever colluded with Russian government officials to try to gain an edge in his 2016 race against the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Any move by Mueller\u2019s team to pursue Trump\u2019s personal financial records comes as the bank continues to negotiate a settlement with the Department of Justice over its so-called mirror trading scheme, in which the bank\u2019s former Moscow branch is alleged to have allowed $10bn to flow out of Russia. Democrats on Capitol Hill have been demanding answers about who might have benefited from the scheme. Deutsche has been fined more than $6bn in connection to compliance failures since 2015. According to an analysis by Bloomberg, Trump now owes Deutsche, his biggest creditor, about $300m. He has four large mortgages, all issued by Deutsche\u2019s private bank. The loans are guaranteed against the president\u2019s properties: a new deluxe hotel in Washington DC\u2019s Old Post Office building, just around the corner from the White House; his Chicago tower hotel; and the Trump National Doral Miami resort. A person close to the matter said other financial institutions with ties to Trump, including Bank of America, would also probably receive requests for information from Mueller\u2019s team. Lawrence Grayson, Bank of America spokesman, declined to comment on whether the bank had received or was anticipating any subpoenas for records from Mueller\u2019s investigation. Deutsche Bank did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Mueller did not respond to a request for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
