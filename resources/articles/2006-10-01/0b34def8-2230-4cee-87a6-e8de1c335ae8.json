The film's 'wigger' (played by Brad Pitt lookalike Channing Tatum) trashes a stage at the Maryland School for the Arts with his black chums, is caught and sentenced to 200 hours of community service at the school. He's a hip hop performer who despises classical music, but, suddenly, the school's top ballerina needs a partner for a gala event. So they join forces and put on a breakdance ballet on the very stage that, two months earlier, he'd demolished. This is a cliche-ridden movie by people to whom formula is clearly mother's milk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
