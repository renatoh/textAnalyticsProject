A couple of days earlier, Mommie Dearest, the musical based on her blockbuster 1978 memoir of the same name, had a run-through at Birdland, the renowned New York jazz venue, and she is hoping the show will find backing for a full production. \u201cIt was sold out, it was fabulous,\u201d she says, looking glamorous and spry, before issuing what has become a standard warning: \u201cThe musical had absolutely nothing to do with the movie. I want to put that in big capital letters.\u201d The movie she is referring to is, of course, the 1981 adaptation of Christina\u2019s memoir that starred Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford, Christina\u2019s adoptive mother, whose abuses, soberly detailed in the book, were turned by the movie into high camp. As chronicled in Mommie Dearest, Crawford slapped, kicked, punched and tried to strangle her daughter, while subjecting her to a severe schedule of cleaning and other household chores, driven by the movie star\u2019s alcoholism and who knows what else. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a language for it,\u201d says Christina. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have laws for it. We didn\u2019t have a social context for it, and we had shame. A tremendous amount of shame, coupled with fear. It wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d She laughs at the understatement. The publication of Mommie Dearest, perhaps the first memoir ever to document child abuse from the point of view of the child, changed the landscape of victim representation and was an early precursor to today\u2019s more robust state of victims\u2019 rights. \u201cI\u2019m not a martyr, but I think, looking back, it is truly amazing to me what one person can do.\u201d It was all a long time ago. Crawford adopted Christina in 1940, and died of a heart attack in 1977. Christina\u2019s younger brother, Christopher, died of cancer in 2006. Lingering interest in the story hinges on enduring fascination with the glamour of that Hollywood era and on the particular contradictions of Crawford. In the context of #MeToo, the story has renewed resonance, and Christina is an interesting case study in the long-range effects of abuse as she tacks between cheerfully declaring herself free from the fallout of her childhood, and testifying to how hard that exorcism has been. She wrote the musical to explicate more fully her relationship with her brother, Christopher \u2013 \u201chow the siblings grow up through the abuse to survive in the real world, with very little going for them except their own love of each other and the will to live\u201d. Long before the term \u201cgaslighting\u201d became mainstream, they were vital as each other\u2019s witness; without Christopher, Christina believes, she wouldn\u2019t have survived. At this many years\u2019 remove, I\u2019m curious as to whether the toxicity of the material continues to have any power over her. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you ever control it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you come to terms with it. I honestly don\u2019t think it controls me any more. It is something that you have to live through, and it\u2019s very difficult, because there\u2019s no roadmap for it, even today. Generally speaking, we don\u2019t recognise the long-term psychological damage that is inflicted on people who are abused, neglected and trafficked. It is hard for people to understand that what happened 20 years ago is creating behaviour patterns today.\u201d At the show, a man sitting next to Christina introduced himself to her as the psychiatrist at Rikers Island, the notorious New York prison \u2013 \u201ccoming to our show to learn about post-traumatic stress disorder. I thought this was fantastic.\u201d Christina\u2019s own survival was something she achieved almost entirely without the help of outside agencies. In the US, child protection laws were introduced from the 1960s, and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, creating a single federal focus for preventing and responding to child abuse and neglect, didn\u2019t come into effect until in 1974. Growing up in Hollywood in the 40s and early 50s, Christina had no recourse to the authorities. In fact, after a particularly violent episode she characterises as her mother \u201ctrying to kill me\u201d, it was Crawford herself who called the police and asked them to arrest her daughter for delinquency. \u201cI was 13 or 14. And it was then that I realised the world had gone insane. The officer was very kind. He told me that there was nothing he could do because there were no laws to protect me. He told me: \u2018You have to try to live [here] until you are 18 and can go free. But, otherwise, if anyone calls me again on you, you\u2019ll have to go to juvenile detention.\u2019\u201d These days, I suggest, Crawford would have been given a diagnosis. Christina looks fiercely indignant. \u201cShe would have been in jail! She would\u2019ve been hauled off to jail for attempted murder. What is the excuse for that? There\u2019s no excuse. It doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s not the issue. And that\u2019s not my responsibility, anyway.\u201d The laws changed, and children became better protected. Christina started to get some distance on her childhood. After being sent, at the age of 10, to boarding school, she understood that the rules she grew up under weren\u2019t normal. She tried to build a degree of self-esteem after years of being told by her mother that she was useless. There was no real therapeutic language at her disposal and no framework for recovery. \u201cIt was day by day. I had some teachers, I had some coaches. I had education, which I adored. For me, education was always the path forward and that\u2019s what I used. It has to do with how much you want to be well. Do you want to be free? And some people fail; they just are not strong enough. A lot of them are dead. And a lot of them are in jail.\u201d She was helped, rather perversely, by a fear of being incarcerated that grew out of her mother\u2019s constant threats to have her put away. \u201cI had a terror of being locked up. How could I not? And my terror of being locked up I think kept me on the straight and narrow.\u201d Fear is the water that abused children swim in, Christina says. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen and your life is so chaotic. But on the other side of the equation, it\u2019s fear from people who are afraid to speak up. Fear that they\u2019re going to lose their job or that people are going to say something bad about them. If you were to ask me about one thing that embraces all of us, it\u2019s the constant fear.\u201d This was precisely her experience. When she was a child, housekeepers, secretaries, nannies and teachers were aware of what was happening, but no one who knew spoke up. After the book came out in 1978, stars of Crawford\u2019s vintage lined up to defend her, as did former members of her household. It was a generational closing of the ranks over what appeared, to Crawford\u2019s contemporaries, to be a piece of monstrous impertinence. Christina laughs very loudly at this. \u201cWell, yes, I think it was! To say the least!\u201d Christina didn\u2019t originally intend to write a tell-all. In her early 20s, she worked as an actor before enrolling on a degree course at UCLA and going on to gain a master\u2019s at the University of Southern California. She would later work in corporate communications. After a period of estrangement in the latter years of her mother\u2019s life, she attempted a reconciliation. Did she think the rapprochement was real? \u201cI thought it was,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it turned out not to have been. No, towards the end, she didn\u2019t have any work. She was an alcoholic. She was ill. She was drug-addicted. And I think she just wasn\u2019t playing with a full deck. And as soon as I left New York to go back to California to work, I completely lost context \u2013 not contact, but context with her, because I wasn\u2019t physically present. Then she died.\u201d In spite of the apparent reconciliation, Christina and Christopher were cut out of the will, for what Crawford cited as \u201creasons which are well known to them\u201d. Christina was so furious she went straight to her desk and started writing down everything that had happened in her childhood. The book sold more than a million copies and suffered an enormous pushback from contemporaries of Crawford\u2019s. It was gaslighting, pure and simple, but Christina wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cNo, I understood Hollywood,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI knew where they were coming from \u2013 they were guilty of seeing and not saying. It was blaming the messenger for the bad news. Most of them are dead now; I have outlived all of them! And I never replied to any of them, or responded. I simply stuck to the message that I knew to be the truth.\u201d Her two younger siblings disputed the book, too, not unusual in an abusive family. \u201cDifferent people in the family experience the parenting situation in different ways. Because the parenting situation is different towards them, and that\u2019s a divide-and-conquer type of situation.\u201d Christopher, in spite of his desire for privacy, remained wholly supportive, she says, and she received thousands of letters \u201cfrom people all over the world who had never heard somebody speak up on their behalf before. And that took me forward on a wave of faith.\u201d The ripple effect is still being felt. \u201cLook at Michigan State, with the gymnasts. Look at Ohio State, with the athletes. Look at Penn State [where the abusive football coach, Jerry Sandusky, was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse]. This is right now.\u201d Even with hashtags exhorting people to believe victims, the law still lags and there is a big caveat around domestic abuse, about which people have a tendency to say \u201cwho knows what really happened\u201d, says Christina. If she could change one law, it would be the statute of limitations. \u201cWhen you have a statute of limitations against sexual abuse of children, then most of the perpetrators go free because some states only have three years. Some have 10. Maybe some have 20. But if it happens to children, then by the time they get old enough to speak out, or to understand what happened to them, the statute of limitations has been reached. And that\u2019s all about protecting the perpetrator.\u201d In 1981, Christina had a debilitating stroke, underwent a five-year long recovery and, for the past 25 years, has lived in rural Idaho, writing a series of follow-ups to Mommie Dearest. I hope her musical finds a backer. It is a timely story, and the focus on her relationship with Christopher is very touching. The fear doesn\u2019t go away when the abuser dies. \u201cNo,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cBecause it\u2019s internal.\u201d With time, and work, however, it lessens. Now, when Christina unexpectedly sees a photo of her mother, she has no reaction. \u201cNothing. No.\u201d Is it indifference? \u201cNo. It\u2019s just \u2026 acceptance.\u201d Can she still be ambushed by responses laid down in her childhood: the fight or flight, hardwired in her brain? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Not any more.\u201d She smiles. \u201cIt has been a long time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
