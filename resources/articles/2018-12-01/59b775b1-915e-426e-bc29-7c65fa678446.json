The 925-mile mission, along with his previous expeditions to the continent, means that Capt Lou Rudd, 49, surpassed a total of 3,000 miles of human-powered travel in Antarctica. The father of three from Hereford finished the gruelling endurance race in 56 days on Friday, two days after the US explorer Colin O\u2019Brady became the first person in history to cross the continent unaided. Rudd, a motor transport officer based at the Infantry Battle School in Brecon, Wales, said he was delighted to have finished the expedition, which he undertook in memory of close friend and explorer Henry Worsley, who died from exhaustion just 30 miles short of completing the record solo crossing in 2016. He said: \u201cMy number one priority and objective was to come out here and ski solo, unsupported and unassisted right across the continent and I\u2019ve done that. That was always the primary objective. \u201cI want to say a huge congratulations to Colin \u2013 what an achievement. To be honest it\u2019s a minor miracle that both of us have completed a journey that\u2019s been attempted before, but nobody\u2019s ever managed it and then, lo and behold, in one season two of us attempting it. The fact that both of us have finished is absolutely fantastic.\u201d Rudd hauled a 140kg sled through 60mph gales, temperatures below minus 30 degrees celsius and over sastrugi \u2013 wave-like ridges created by wind \u2013 surviving off a grazing bag of chocolate, nuts, cheese and salami. \u201cWhat matters most to me is that I\u2019ve completed my expedition \u2013 and honoured Henry\u2019s memory by carrying his family crest across Antarctica. I know he would have appreciated that. That\u2019s what is really important to me. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve both done it really fast. Incredibly fast. I\u2019ve finished it within a couple of days of a professional athlete, and I\u2019m delighted with that.\u201d The army officer documented his Spirit of Endurance expedition in blog posts since he began on 3 November, which saw him describing his coping methods during the brutal journey such as a Winston Churchill audiobook and a 1980s music playlist."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
