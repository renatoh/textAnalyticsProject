Boro followed Sunderland's script and dumped the Toon on its backside, even down to conceding a late penalty which United obligingly missed. Now Bobby Robson is to get \u00a350m in the summer to ensure such traumas are not endured again. \"For the first time in a long time, there's cash in the bank,\" said the United vice-chairman Douglas Hall, who has opted against selling his 47.2% stake in the club. \"We are already bigger and more financially stable than Barcelona. Our turnover is not as large as Manchester United's, but we have possibly a larger stockpile of cash because we haven't gone crazy over the last 12 months with transfer fees. \"Rivaldo was always my dream and Newcastle should attract players of his quality. We can attract any player from anywhere in the world. This is where it all takes off again.\" After a season of big-name departures, sceptics may need to be convinced that the cream of the continent can be enticed. \"This reminds me of John Hall saying exactly what the fans want to hear,\" said Mark Jensen, editor of the Newcastle fanzine The Mag. \"We need action, not words.\" Such chequebook clout is required. After their bright start had sparked no more than a disallowed goal from Clarence Acuna, Newcastle laboured in gloomy mediocrity. By the time Carl Cort volleyed past Mark Schwarzer, they trailed to two Alen Boksic goals. Just five minutes remained when Paul Ince and Steve Vickers sandwiched Cort in the area. Alan Shearer had fluffed an 83rd-minute chance at parity against Sunderland in November; now it was Nolberto Solano who slapped the penalty against the bar. \"It would have been a cruel blow to have conceded,\" said Boro coach Terry Venables, whose side now sit four points above the drop zone. \"Maybe they thought so too and let us off.\" Boro arrived without a win in eight games and minus their \u00a31m signing Dean Windass who had \"put his back out\" lifting his kit bag out of the car boot. In his absence, Venables threw Boksic forward in a lone role, supported by a trio of midfielders strung in front of Paul Okon and Ince. The tactics utterly outfoxed the home side - despite the loss of Phil Stamp for two idiotic offences on the stroke of half-time - yet it needed the brilliant Boksic to earn only Boro's second win on Tyneside since 1953. Having earned a free-kick, the former Lazio striker leapt to nod Christian Karembeu's cross beyond Shay Given. Five minutes later, Ince's burst through the centre was checked illegally and Boksic curled a mouth-watering free-kick into the top corner. His job done, he was substituted two minutes from time to envious eyes in the stands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
