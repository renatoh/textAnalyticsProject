Rifkind's name was discovered on confidential Iraqi diplomatic communiques found in the country's ransacked Foreign Ministry in Baghdad shortly after the fall of Saddam in 2003. The contents of the papers have been confirmed as genuine and reveal that an Australian oil company which Rifkind was working for tried to open a business relationship with Saddam's government. One paper written in Arabic, with the stamp of the Republic of Iraq's Foreign Ministry, is marked 'confidential'. At the top Rifkind's name is underlined. It discloses that on 11 February 1999 Rifkind's executive assistant at the firm BHP sent a letter to Iraq's ambassador at the UN, Saeed al-Mousawi, offering him a meeting with the former cabinet minister. Rifkind, who had lost his parliamentary seat in the 1997 election, took part in a four-day visit to the US in early 1999 on behalf of BHP. Among other things, the Australian firm was keen to discuss proposals with Iraq for developing the country's oil fields and supplying parts to Iraq's oil industry. The meeting was planned at a sensitive time. Iraq was subject to strict sanctions, and only three months earlier the US, UK and Australia launched Operation Desert Fox, a cruise missile attack against military targets in Baghdad in response to Saddam's continued failure to comply with UN resolutions. Any contact with Saddam's regime would have been highly controversial. The Iraqi documents reveal that a meeting did take place between a senior BHP executive and Mousawi in New York on 26 February, but Rifkind did not attend. Instead the Scottish head of the firm's Petroleum Middle East business, Norman Davidson-Kelly, who shared a secretary with Rifkind, met the ambassador. Rifkind told The Observer that while he was in New York with Davidson-Kelly he never had any intention of attending the meeting. He blamed it on a simple mistake by a BHP secretary who had inadvertently put his name on the letter to Iraq's mission at the United Nations. 'I knew nothing about the letter being sent, and when I found out I made it clear that under no circumstances was I willing to be involved in any such meetings,' said Rifkind, who still works as a high-level consultant for BHP. He denied that the company had used his name and was adamant that he was not going to do anything that would provide succour to the Iraqi government. The Iraqi document that names Rifkind is marked for the attention of the Iraqi oil minister. It was found by Peter Wilson of the Australian newspaper, who discovered the papers in the Baghdad ministry on 14 April 2003, a few days after US troops entered the Iraqi capital. It states: 'Our permanent mission in New York advised us via Fax no 49, dated 11/02/1999 that they received a note from the Executive Assistant of the former Minister of Defence, thereafter Foreign Minister Sir Malcolm Rifkind who is now employed at BHP Oil Company. She (the Executive Assistant) requested an opportunity for a meeting of his Excellency [Rifkind] with our permanent representative during his visit to New York between 27/2/1999 and 01/3/1999. Our Permanent representative there has been instructed to meet with his Excellency and listen to his views.' The communique continued: 'Our Mission advised us ... of the meeting that took place on 26/2/1999 between our permanent representative in New York and Mr Norman Davidson Kelly, head of the Middle East Branch of the Australian BHP Oil Company, who advised him that Sir Malcolm Rifkind could not come to New York and he has personally come over instead... He spoke... about the projects his company proposed for developing oil fields and supplying spare parts for the oil industry. He also expressed his desire to visit Iraq next March should the circumstances be appropriate.' A second document from Iraq's UN ambassador to its foreign minister Mohammed Saeed Sahaf on the day of the meeting stated: 'Mr Kelly said that Sir Malcolm Rifkind (the former British Foreign Minister) could not come over to New York to meet with us and that he is coming instead of him.' According to the communique, the Iraqi ambassador asked why an Australian firm wanted to do business with Iraq months after it had supported a US-led cruise missile attack in Baghdad. The BHP executive replied that many Australians were 'amazed at Australia's staunch backing of the military' attack. Davidson-Kelly confirmed to The Observer that the meeting did take place but said no deals were done and the company was simply exploring opportunities, either within the UN-approved oil-for-food programme or, if sanctions ended. There is no evidence that BHP was attempting to break sanctions. He added: 'Malcolm acted exceptionally honourably throughout, and as soon as he realised a mistake had been made, he made it clear it would be wrong for him to attend the meeting.' Davidson-Kelly, who has since left BHP, said: 'He was a previous Foreign Secretary and Defence Minister and regarded as very useful, not only by BHP but by the Australian government. He could offer different perspectives of high-level political issues.' Rifkind - now Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary - was one of few Tories to speak out against the war. He has claimed that will be an advantage in the Tory leadership race. Yet his return to high-profile politics has brought renewed scrutiny of his business career. After he lost his seat he took up jobs in the private sector. BHP, which he continues to work for, has won oil-related contracts in Iraq. He also chairs the Armor Group, a large military firm that won security contracts in Iraq after the war. These are worth \u00a36.5m a year and include guarding Foreign Office staff in Baghdad and Basra. Rifkind has said he will give up all his executive posts should he become Tory leader. antony.barnett@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
