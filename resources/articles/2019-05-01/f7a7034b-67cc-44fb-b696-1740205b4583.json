The England defender, who has been included in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for next month\u2019s Nations League, had apparently been sounded out by a suitor \u2013 there is no indication Spurs had given permission for an approach, and the player does not reveal the identity of the club \u2013 over a potential move. In the build-up to the World Cup Rose had gone public on his struggles with mental health, suggesting his depression had been triggered by the treatment of a knee injury coupled with family tragedy. \u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go in football because in the summer I was speaking to another club and they said: \u2018The club would like to meet you, just to check that you\u2019re not crazy,\u2019 because of what I\u2019d said and what I\u2019d been through,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI was embarrassed, as whatever I\u2019ve been through, I like to think it doesn\u2019t affect me doing my job. I still know I\u2019ll always give 100%. \u201cIn the end they didn\u2019t put a bid in but to think that people assume I might be crazy is embarrassing and I\u2019m still angry about it. If that opportunity came around again I\u2019d definitely say no now.\u201d The 28-year-old was speaking in conversation with the Duke of Cambridge in a BBC documentary, A Royal Team Talk: Tackling Mental Health, to be broadcast on Sunday. The film sets out to tackle the importance of talking about men\u2019s mental health, with suicide still the biggest killer of men under the age of 45. Rose, a key member of the Tottenham team who have reached the Champions League final, had suggested his depression deepened as he contended with the triple trauma of his uncle killing himself, his mum, Angela, being racially abused and an assailant shooting at his brother inside the family home.
