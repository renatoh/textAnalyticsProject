That should have spawned one bizarre mish-mash, but - like many groups who claim a panoply of eclectic influences - Phenomenal Handclap Band are less adventurous than they'd like to believe. On Form &amp; Control, they stick to a conventional disco/funk template (whorls of synth, stabbing horns) and frost it with stomping electro-pop. It actually works pretty well, though. There's a hip-swinging looseness to the grooves, and loucheness to the vocals (four of the six members take turns singing lead), that's instantly uplifting. The Right One, which samples the Human Leagues's Don't You Want Me?, is a hilariously deadpan, wordy chant about competitiveness, while The Written Word and the title track are bonanzas for fans of arm-waving disco-house. But the \"control\" element of the title is present all the way through, and the songs never quite transcend the feeling they're a bit too school for cool."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
