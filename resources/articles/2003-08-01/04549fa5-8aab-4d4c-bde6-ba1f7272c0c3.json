Kabir and his new wife Fozia Tabesen were out shopping when the call came and he failed to check his messages. \"I didn't have a clue until about four o'clock. Vikram [Solanki - a team-mate at Worcestershire] called to say congratulations and that he'd seen it on Sky. I thought he was pulling my leg. \"Then I had a message from somebody, I'm not sure what his name was, saying, 'Well done. Congratulations'. But I wasn't having any of it.\" In fact it was not until he checked with Tom Moody, his director of cricket at Worcestershire, that Kabir began to believe. \"Even then I still wasn't convinced until I rang David Graveney myself.\" Graveney, chairman of the England selectors, told Kabir that he and the Surrey seamer Martin Bicknell were in the squad for the fourth Test at Headingley because Steve Harmison had injured his calf in the victory at Edgbaston. \"I didn't even know Harmison was injured,\" said Kabir. \"After Scarborough, I was just hoping my name might be mentioned.\" It was, although Kabir did not know that either. On Thursday morning, the day after he had taken eight for 53 against Yorkshire, Graveney said that the 22-year-old was very much in the selectors' minds. That was Kabir's career best, and the best performance by any bowler in this season's championship. It beat his own eight for 58 against Derbyshire last month, figures he recorded while mourning the death of his two-week-old nephew. Kabir comes from a close-knit Muslim family and still lives with his parents, three sisters and one younger brother in Sparkhill, Birmingham. A cousin, Kadeer, is also on Worcestershire's books, and another, Moeen Ali, is on the staff at Warwickshire. Kabir, who says he tries to pray five times a day, was badly affected by the death. \"It was a difficult time,\" Moody said yesterday, \"but he showed a lot of maturity and a lot of character. Sometimes things like that see the best come out of you. \"I've always felt there was no question that he could force his way into the Test picture. I felt as long as he kept himself in the shop window, continued to improve a couple of areas of his game, then he would put the selectors in a position where they couldn't help but pick him.\" It was Moody who helped Kabir remodel his action when he picked up a stress fracture in his back two years ago. Between them they developed a more open-chested style that earned Kabir 71 wickets last season - his first full season with Worcestershire. More work went into the new style when he met up with England's bowling coach, Troy Cooley, at the national academy in Australia during the winter and it was from there that he got his first England call-up. He joined the one-day squad in Australia but played only one warm-up game - \"I didn't really bowl that well\". The second call came last month when he was picked for the NatWest Series. He was selected for one match - against Zimbabwe at Headingley - but the rain arrived before he could either bat or bowl. \"It was a bit frustrating,\" he said yesterday. \"Hopefully this time I might get a few chances. I've only played at Headingley once before, in a one-day match, and I took five wickets so I have good memories.\" Kabir facts Born November 24, 1980 Birthplace Birmingham County Worcestershire County debut 1999 Best 1st class batting 51 not out v Northants, 2002 Best 1st class bowling 7-43 v Oxford University CCE, 2002 Worcestershire player of the year in 2002.
