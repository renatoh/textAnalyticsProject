On Saturday he was berated after flying into a hideous challenge on his Charlton debut and then last night he struck a superb late winner to end 89 minutes of frustration for England in Herning. Not much was going right for young England - even the dismissal of Morten Rasmussen for a second yellow card just after the interval could not provide Peter Taylor's side with the spark required to break down a stubborn Danish defence. Carlton Cole, who wasted a great chance to put England ahead early on, made amends in the dying seconds by heading Nicky Hunt's long ball into Ambrose's path. The midfielder had just recovered from a bruising challenge but was alive enough to drive a crisp strike into the bottom corner to give England the win. Kieran Richardson, so impressive with the full squad in the United States, certainly set off as if he meant to ensure that his return to the youth ranks would be a brief one. His deft flick to Cole early on was a particular highlight, even if the striker shot wide. Stewart Downing was equally elusive down the left flank, but England could not make their superiority count. Rasmussen got his first yellow for a sly kick at Richardson just before the break and left the field after a brutal lunge on Jonathan Stead six minutes after the re-start. Yet, as full-time approached, a draw looked certain, particularly when the Denmark goalkeeper Kevin Stuhr-Ellegaard bravely blocked an Ambrose effort, injuring the Charlton midfielder in the process. Moments later though the same player struck a ferocious shot to put the weekend's travails firmly behind him. Denmark: Stuhr-Ellegaard, Troest, Andreasen, Martin Jensen, Hogh, Kamper, Jakob Poulsen, Thygesen, Sorensen, Lorentzen, Morten Rasmussen. England: Carson; Hunt, Davenport, Dawson, Ridgewell, Milner, Reo-Coker, Richardson, Downing, Cole, Ashton. Referee: D Stalhammar (Denmark)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
