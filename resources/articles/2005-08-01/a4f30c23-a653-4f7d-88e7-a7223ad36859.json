So BBC2's Sad to Be Gay came as a bit of a surprise, being not just \"one man's journey\" but also an attempt to grasp a few abstract concepts in an easily digested 50-minute format. Interesting and short? Now that really is a double delight for the TV critic. David Akinsanya was an attractive, intelligent and charmingly world-weary Essex man, physically fit but emotionally unsatisfied. As such, you'd think he'd have potential partners beating down his door - but, curiously, David remained alone. Getting laid was not a problem but love was elusive, and like anyone who's spent their formative years sloshing around gay clubs at closing time, he was mighty disillusioned. David concluded that the problem was not his way of life but his fundamental nature. Being gay was what was making him unhappy, he thought, and this he sought to change. Instead of staying in with a good book and waiting for Mr Right, David signed up for a course in Memphis, Tennessee, that claimed to convert people from \"immoral lifestyle cultures\", at a cost of $700 a week, all in the name of Jesus Christ. Many of David's fellow sufferers had signed up for four weeks and stayed for nine months, bankrolled by families and churches. The course leaders at Love in Action peddled such evil nonsense as \"we were all born normal children\" and encouraged David to believe that sexual abuse in childhood had turned him gay. They did everything they could to associate homosexuality with pain and fear. \"There's a lot of shame in this room,\" said one of the counsellors, with an air of pride. Game as he was, David couldn't last long. He recounted his bitter tale of a childhood in care, his abandonment by parents and his precociously sexualised adolescence. He cried in public, which pleased the rest of the group no end (\"Thank you for sharing your tears\"). They were all hooked on misery, rather like British television audiences, and got quite turned on by the waterworks. Eventually, however, David realised that \"they all hate themselves\", and that there was no conversion or liberation going on here, just control. He walked out, came home and lived in blissful chastity for a couple of months, having realised that it wasn't being gay he hated, but being on the gay scene. Around this compelling narrative framework, producer/director Kathryn Park built an impressive analytical structure. She used archive footage of the struggle for gay rights sparingly but effectively - so effectively, in fact, that I started shouting \"Deserter!\" at David as he tried to leave the ranks. She showed the real misery and confusion of the men and women who have sold their identity for the empty promises of a corrupt church. She even used the backing music to make a point. Pop songs in documentaries are usually pointless, but here there was wit and wisdom. Jimi Hendrix's The Wind Cries Mary was hilarious; Cat Stevens's Father and Son was even more moving than usual. Hopefully, Sad to Be Gay will prevent the \"ex-Gay\" movement from ever getting a toehold in the UK. With luck, David Akinsanya will realise that being fed up with clubs, finding the scene \"shallow\" and longing for love makes him, in fact, a typical gay man. It would also be nice to think that Sad to Be Gay will end the laziness and stereotyping that characterises so many social documentaries, and usher in a golden age of subtlety and intelligence - but let's not ask for miracles. David's problems lay in unresolved childhood traumas and, as if to remind us of the value of the early years, BBC2 followed up with My Life As a Child. Three little girls of seven, eight and nine were issued with video cameras, which could have been a recipe for disaster but turned out to be something that was sweet, questioning and subversive. They discussed race, religion, fashion, marriage, football, education and housing - that's all the BBC departments covered, then - and didn't make a bad job of the camerawork either. Childhood was allowed, for once, to be articulate, occasionally obnoxious and uncensored. To see a nine-year-old girl throwing off her clothes and denying the existence of God would have delighted William Blake, had he been watching."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
