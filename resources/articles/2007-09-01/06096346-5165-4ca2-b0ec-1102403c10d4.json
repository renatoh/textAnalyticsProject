The England manager has learned how fractured a reputation can get when you plummet from the heights of praise. There had, until Saturday, been barely a kind word since he was garlanded for the merry 4-0 win in the friendly against Greece with which his tenure began. \"We've done nothing,\" he said warily after this defeat of Israel. \"We've just put ourselves in a slightly better position.\" England, in third place, are still below the surface of Group E and their situation has been so dark that it has felt as if they were tunnelling towards Euro 2008. This win may not be no guide to the meeting with Russia on Wednesday but it should be appreciated nonetheless. It has, after all, been a long while since England were so clinical in exploiting weaknesses and the left-back Yoav Ziv, in particular, suffered terribly as a footballer realising that he had been singled out for persecution. McClaren's strategy was well judged and ruthlessly executed. Israel are not used to this sort of treatment and their last away defeat in a qualifier had come as long ago as October 2003, when France beat them 3-0. They made regrettable history against England by becoming the first visitors to seem scared stiff of an international at the new Wembley and McClaren's side feasted on that insecurity. Managers long to put their own imprint on a team and that was achieved on this occasion. Micah Richards may have been the sole member of the starting line-up to have made his international debut under McClaren, but there was a revitalising effect in the presence of Gareth Barry, getting another outing in a competitive game for England after a seven-year wait. The Aston Villa captain is one-paced but he has the knack of standing off the play and weighing up all possibilities. A confident pass took out three Israel players in the 49th minute, even if Michael Owen still had to summon up virtuosity by turning and sending a sweet 20-yard shot past Dudu Aouate for England's second goal. \"Teams evolve,\" said McClaren contentedly afterwards, thinking of Barry's contribution and that of the returning Emile Heskey. No sooner had that comment been made than he was prudently testifying to the continuing importance of the injured David Beckham and Owen Hargreaves. The latter is expected to get over a thigh strain and there is a good case for fielding him against Russia in preference to Barry. The Manchester United player is a more specialised defensive midfielder and could be detailed to nullify the visitors' Andrei Arshavin. By the same token, Heskey might be omitted now that Peter Crouch has served his suspension. None the less, the Wigan attacker has made it awkward for the manager to dispense with him. There was an ugly thrash over the crossbar when, with the game still goalless, Owen set him up, but Heskey's strength and athleticism constantly made Israel's defenders groan. When they weren't being overpowered they were being run off their feet. Shaun Wright-Phillips, recovering the knack of finding his man now that he has regained his confidence, broke the deadlock and laid on a series of opportunities for others. \"He's a nightmare to defend against,\" said McClaren. \"We knew he'd get crosses in, but we hoped to see goals coming from midfield and I was delighted with the first one. He's so strong. It looks like he might lose the ball but he gets it back. He's a fighter as well. That's key.\" Wright-Phillips put England ahead in the 20th minute. Joe Cole curled a ball behind poor Ziv and the Chelsea winger hit the net with a first-time finish. The scoring was completed when Micah Richards recorded his first international goal, heading in a Barry corner after 66 minutes as the referee Peter Vink failed to see that Owen had taken a step to impede Aouate. The teenager Richards is as precocious as he is powerful, winning converts, who may well include the manager, to his belief that he ought to keep his place even when Gary Neville is fit. \"From day one,\" McClaren recalled of the 19-year-old, \"he breezed in. He was vocal, he was aggressive, he wanted the ball and he had no fear.\" England could have piled up goals even if Richards' effort had been chalked off and Owen squandered two attempts following a lay-off from Joe Cole after 37 minutes. When the Newcastle striker rounded Aouate following a pass from the substitute Andrew Johnson in the 87th minute Ziv, persistent even when overwhelmed, intervened to block. There was the all but forgotten vision on Saturday of McClaren's team enjoying themselves. One angled pass from Steven Gerrard to Joe Cole had an air of exhibition football, but Aouate spoiled the spectacle by saving with his legs. Sightings of glee were reported in the England side and the two Coles clearly had fun as they combined on the left. Gerrard, after all the debate about his fractured toe, was not at risk of any further damage, apart from experiencing a touch of cramp. He merely needed to participate for 71 minutes of what turned out to be a mild workout. This victory cannot have made Russia gibber, but England approach the fixture in a happier frame of mind than they have known for almost a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
