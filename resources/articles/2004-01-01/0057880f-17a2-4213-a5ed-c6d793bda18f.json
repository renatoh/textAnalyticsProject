Purple Tin!!! In a professional capacity, of course, we've feigned interest in the on-going Group Six fixtures furore, wondering just who would play where and in what order. As you'd expect, sleep has been at a premium at Fiver Towers, but today, finally and not before time, the fixture list was finally confirmed after several hours' tinkering in a Cardiff Travel Tavern, and we can all rest easy again. Carefully constructed so as to afford Wales a better chance of progressing, the fixtures ensure Ryan Giggs sits out his two-match ban against the group's hapless whupping boys: away to Azerbaijan in the opening game on September 4, and at home to Northern Ireland four days later. The group's other whupping boys England (you'll see) open with away games in Austria and Poland, before hosting the Welsh on October 9, probably at Old Traffo... hold on, this won't do. You deserve better than a write-around of the full fixture list. So what say we just throw in a few post-palaver quotes from the men involved and be done with it? \"We would have loved to play Wales without Ryan Giggs. But there was not a hope in hell of Wales agreeing to that!\" - David Davies, The FA \"We've got the first five games the way we wanted... and a decent first two games against Azerbaijan and Northern Ireland!\" - Mark Hughes, Wales \"What's the point, eh?\" - Jim Boyce, Irish FA ALL THE BATTLE-OF-BRITAIN FIXTURES IN ONE EASY-TO-READ, CUT-OUT-AND-KEEP, SPACE-FILLING LIST September 8 2004: Northern Ireland v Wales October 9 2004: England v Wales March 26 2005: England v Northern Ireland September 3 2005: Wales v England September 7 2005: Northern Ireland v England October 8 2005: Northern Ireland v Wales TROUBLE AHOY! OF THE DAY \"I am simply not in a team that allows me to shine\"- Nicolas Anelka, this morning, in French. \"He is enjoying his football and scoring goals and I believe he is happy here\" - Kevin Keegan, this afternoon, in denial. OH, FERNANDO! You've got to feel sorry for Alex Ferg... actually, we're not even going to bother finishing that. But whichever way you look at it, he's had a bad day. \"It is a very sad situation,\" wailed Fergie this morning, in the sort of lost, maudlin tone only normally heard after someone has enjoyed far too many nippy sweeties. \"Nicky Butt has asked to leave. He wants to play first-team football. So he has asked to leave.\" Some would say Fergie's sentences were deliberately delivered in an uncharacteristic staccato style to suggest a searing pain not necessarily felt - rather like adding a couple of extra ostentatious sniffs and snivels when phoning in \"sick\" - but not us. And things went from \"bad\" to genuinely worse for Fergie later, as Real Valladolid boss Fernando Vasquez turned down an offer to be the latest FerGimp at Old Trafford. \"Manchester United have renewed their interest but I cannot suddenly abandon the project I have started at Valladolid,\" announced Vasquez, using the sort of pompous, overblown and self-regarding rhetoric that would make him a natural on the touchline at the self-styled One United's self-styled Theatre of Dreams. \"I am a man of ethics and principles\" - see? - \"and I only leave a club if the board gets rid of me.\" Well done, Fernando. Well done for being such a gent, well done. But no other news is good news, or at least no other bad news. Because Fergie didn't have to worry about the stuff plastered all over the papers this morning: not the Tim Howard tapping thing involving his son Jason, nor the alleged putsch being planned in the Old Trafford boardroom by John Magnier and JP McManus. Why? Because neither story has moved on one jot, that's why. Which is just as well, because we can't recall the details of either of them, and deadline is fast approaching, so research would be out of the question. Hey, it might have been an unlucky day for Fergie, but for once, we're not complaining. THE RUMOUR MILL The aforementioned Nicky Butt is suddenly the talk of excited boardrooms at Spurs, Everton, Boro and Birmingham, not to mention Newcastle. Cue Fergie's fledglings drivel. Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea have all been linked with Luis Figo after his oh-so-subtle talk of new challenges. Liverpool would be a challenge alright, we'll give him that. Arsene Wenger has told Kanu he can leave Arsenal on a free transfer in the summer as they will not renew his \u00a342,000-a-week contrac... how effing much?!? NEWS IN BRIEF George Reynolds has resigned as chairman and director of Darlington, severing all ties with the club. He's not taken that ridiculous stadium away with him, mind, letting them go back to Feethams. Charlton have pitched a large \"Keep Out\" sign in their front garden after Chelsea made an \"enquiry\" about the availability of midfielder Scott Parker. Hearts have rejected a \u00a312m offer for Tynecastle, despite needing to sell up and move in at Murrayfield in order to settle \u00a317m debts. Graeme Souness is currently banging his head against a brick wall as Dino Baggio has refused to go on loan to Ancona in favour of trying his luck at Blackburn.
