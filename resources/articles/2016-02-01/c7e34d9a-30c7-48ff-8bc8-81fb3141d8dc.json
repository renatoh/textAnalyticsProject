Shailesh Vara, a work and pensions minister, listed unemployment benefit as a possible source of income for the millions of women who will have to wait up to 18 months longer to receive their entitlements because the state pension age is rising from 60 to 65 by 2018. He made the comments shortly before a packed Westminster debate triggered by a petition of more than 140,000 people. Campaigners say the pension reforms, which the government made in 2011, are too rushed and have not given millions of women enough time to plan for their retirement. House of Commons research for Labour has calculated that 2.6 million women born in the 1950s will be affected. However, Vara ruled out compensation or concessions for the women, and said the changes needed to be seen in a broader context. He told MPs: \u201cThere are a whole lot of other benefits that are available to the women who may be affected. For example, there\u2019s jobseeker\u2019s allowance, there\u2019s employment and support allowance, there\u2019s income support, carer\u2019s allowance, personal independence payments. \u201cAnd let us not forget that also pensions will be uprated. There\u2019s the triple lock. There\u2019s the simplified new state pension, which is coming in from April. Pension freedom, which allows those who have a pension to be able to have some flexibility. \u201cCold weather payments \u2013 there\u2019s a permanent increase there. Winter fuel payment has been protected \u2013 over 12 million pensioners benefited from that last year. And as far as female employment is concerned, I\u2019ve mentioned a number of benefits that we have brought in for them. \u201cSo it is important that we look at things in a broad context rather than simply looking at people in the narrow confines that people prefer to debate in this chamber at the moment.\u201d Rachel Reeves, the former shadow work and pensions secretary, said the comments were \u201coutrageous\u201d. \u201cWomen don\u2019t want unemployment benefit they want the pensions they have contributed to,\u201d she added. Angela Rayner, a shadow work and pensions minister, said it was \u201cshocking\u201d that Vara suggested jobseeker\u2019s allowance as an alternative. \u201cThis research shows that a staggering 2.6 million women are set to be affected by the government\u2019s reforms,\u201d she said. \u201cBy accelerating the rise in women\u2019s state pension age and failing to communicate the changes properly, millions of families feel they have had their plans for later life ruined. \u201cIt is a testament to the strength of this campaign that over 140,000 people supported calls for a debate, which was so oversubscribed that scores of MPs were not able to make their voices heard.\u201d The Westminster Hall debate was led by Labour MP Helen Jones, who said she was of the age that will be affected by the delay to pensions, but a number of Tory MPs also raised concerns and called for transitional relief."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
