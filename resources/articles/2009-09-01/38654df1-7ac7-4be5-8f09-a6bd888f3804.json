Lyons attacked the government over its refusal to ask viewers and listeners if they would like to see licence fee money earmarked to meet the cost of digital switchover returned to them. \"We had the courage to ask them for their views. Why didn't you?\" he asked Bradshaw. The government published research earlier this week which found that most licence fee payers support the idea of using that cash to fund independent consortiums to take over the provision of ITV's regional news service. The culture secretary responded by saying viewers who were asked if they wanted to receive \"a cheque in the post\" were bound to say yes. Lyons said the use of the cash was about \"honest taxation\". Earlier, Bradshaw told an audience of TV executives that there may \"be a case for a smaller licence fee\" and said of the BBC Trust: \"I don't think it's a sustainable model.\" As well as hinting he would like to see the BBC's regulatory and governance body disbanded, Bradshaw, a former BBC journalist, used his first major speech to say \"the BBC probably has reached the limits of reasonable expansion\". Bradshaw's comments to the Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge provide further evidence of the strained relationship between ministers and the BBC. Corporation executives are fighting to retain control of the \u00a33.6bn annual licence fee, which the government wants it to share with other broadcasters. The culture secretary said the BBC should not add any more channels or services, warning: \"If it were to continue on anything like that trajectory, the rest of the industry would be right to be worried\". The current five-year BBC licence fee deal runs to early 2013, at which point a further five-year agreement is due for negotiation. However, the Conservatives have already said they would freeze the licence fee if they get into power. Attacking the BBC Trust and Lyons, Bradshaw said: \"I know of no other area of public life where \u2026 the same body is both regulator and cheerleader.\" Bradshaw also seemed to endorse some of the criticisms levelled at the BBC by James Murdoch, the head of News Corporation in Europe and Asia, last month. He said Murdoch \"did us all a favour\" by \"raising genuine concerns\" about the BBC. Lord Carter's Digital Britain report, published in June, says the licence fee should fund news consortiums, made up of local papers and broadcasters, to take over regional news on ITV1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
