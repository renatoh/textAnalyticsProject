Klopp said their first Premier League defeat of the campaign, which followed a run of relatively sluggish performances, may have come at a good time to hone their focus for the next three months. The centre-back Dejan Lovren thought similarly and suggested Liverpool have lacked their usual aggression since the winter break. When asked if defeat could be a kick up the backside, Klopp replied: \u201cYeah, why not? But none of us has just lost for the first time in our lives. We know how it feels. Still, you don\u2019t want to have it. The reaction, you can hope for. We shall see in the next games. \u201cSometimes a little knock is important. So I don\u2019t see anything negative in it. From time to time if you are not good enough, you need to see [the] effect. Not good enough \u2013 what happens then? So restart. Maybe the longer the [undefeated] run goes maybe it becomes more important. But I didn\u2019t see that today. Now it is over. We can start again with whatever we did before, and we will.\u201d Lovren, who had a difficult evening on his first Premier League appearance since 7 December, said the 3-0 defeat was \u201ca proper wake-up call to everyone\u201d and \u201clike someone hit us in our faces\u201d. He agreed recent performances lacked their usual vigour. \u201cI think the manager knows we are missing something,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is about the aggression when we lose the ball and recovering the ball as quickly as possible. Always [Watford] were there for the second balls. We should look at this and realise we have to do much, much better.\u201d The intensity and discipline with which Watford performed might have suggested they spent a tough week perfecting their gameplan. But Troy Deeney, who scored their third goal and set up the second for Isma\u00efla Sarr, explained the manager, Nigel Pearson, had taken the heat off by turning down their workload. \u201cDo you want to know the God\u2019s honest truth? This week was the least we\u2019ve done,\u201d Deeney said. \u201cWe had a yoga day on Thursday. We came away from the training ground and went to Nuffield [health centre] for a yoga and swimming day because the gaffer wanted to clear our minds. Everyone was putting too much pressure on this. \u201cThat shows testament to the manager, man-managing and not getting caught up in the hype over \u2018we have to win this game\u2019. So we had our least demanding week in months.\u201d Deeney took pride in Watford\u2019s assertive approach and said they had taken inspiration from one of the previous weekend\u2019s sporting success stories. \u201cWe took heed from Tyson Fury,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought: \u2018We\u2019re going to go on the front foot and have it out with them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
