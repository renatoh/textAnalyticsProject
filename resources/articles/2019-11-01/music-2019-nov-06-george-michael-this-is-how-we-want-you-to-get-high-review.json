David Bowie and Prince\u2019s deaths led to an unlocking of the vaults and a scouring for unreleased material: the fourth box set of late 1960s Bowie demos in the space of a year will shortly be released; as will a \u201csuper-deluxe\u201d version of Prince\u2019s 1999, out this month, that inflates the original double album to 10 discs. But Michael\u2019s estate has largely kept things low-key, releasing only a solitary posthumous single the singer was working on before his death and a version of his 1990 solo album Listen Without Prejudice that includes a live show. Now there\u2019s a new single, This Is How (We Want You to Get High), recorded the year before the singer died. Whether it signals an opening of the floodgates of unreleased music remains to be seen, but somehow you doubt it. For one thing, Michael was not a particularly prolific solo artist \u2013 five studio albums in 29 years, one of them a collection of covers \u2013 although there\u2019s always the chance that he discarded a lot more music than he released. But for another, This Is How (We Want You to Get High) sounds like a very odd choice for the soundtrack of a feelgood Christmas romcom, suggesting they couldn\u2019t find anything else. The film Last Christmas, written by Emma Thompson, was approved by Michael in 2013, but the solitary new song amid the classics is, for all its propulsive acoustic guitar and Giorgio Moroder-ish synth, pretty downcast: a saga of paternal dissipation and its effects on children that comes with a side order of what sounds like the die-hard weed-smoker\u2019s penchant for contrasting the benign effects of their chosen intoxicant with the destructive impact of booze. \u201cI never picked a fight in my life, or raised a hand to my wife, or saw my children as a thing to bully,\u201d affirms Michael. It\u2019s very much a product of the 2000s, both in its sound \u2013 the vocals have a liberal application of Auto-Tune \u2013 and in the fact that it\u2019s not the kind of nailed-on, giant-chorused pop smash that Michael once turned out in profusion but were less numerous on his final studio album, 2004\u2019s haunted and troubled Patience. This single is more compact and punchy than that album\u2019s gauziest moments, but the mood is similar. That said, if you want poignancy, This Is How (We Want You to Get High) has plenty of it, albeit by default rather than design. \u201cI was always trying to get my life together,\u201d offers Michael at one point. \u201cI guess we always knew it would be.\u201d It ends with a lovely ambient coda, prefaced by Michael \u201cdreaming of a summer day that never came \u2026 it\u2019s hard to be more than we\u2019ve seen\u201d. Of course, the likelihood is that he isn\u2019t breaking character or singing about himself, but its posthumous release gives those lines a different kind of weight to the one you suspect their author \u2013 and Last Christmas\u2019s directors \u2013 intended. For fans, meanwhile, just hearing his voice again, singing something they\u2019ve never heard before, is doubtless enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
