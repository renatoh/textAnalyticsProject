They queued around the block in 2015 to see him claim the Labour leadership; weeks after he last ran to be prime minister they gathered in a field in Glastonbury and sang his name. And in 2019 he can still pull a crowd. They\u2019ll come miles, pack out halls, end up so far back that they can\u2019t hear, let alone see him. All for a politician not known for his soaring oratory; whose CV boasts not one single day in government. But they come anyway \u2013 to hear a contender for power promise a more generous public sector, a government that cares, a different politics and language than they\u2019ve known for decades. An era that could begin next week. A Saturday afternoon at the community hall in the West Yorkshire village of Mytholmroyd is typical. Tickets for the Labour leader\u2019s pitstop went on offer one evening at teatime; they\u2019d all gone before breakfast next morning. Now there\u2019s about 300 people in their mud-caked walking boots and waterproofs. Calder Valley is the sort of seat Corbyn must win to get into No 10 and, as he reminds activists on the penultimate weekend of the campaign, it\u2019s there for the taking. Tory MP Craig Whittaker holds it by a tiny majority of just 609 and the Greens, who racked up 631 votes in 2017, are sitting this one out. Party staffers call this event a \u201cMe-Mo\u201d, a member mobilisation, yet Corbyn avoids any hard sell. No one is asked to do anything for him. Rhetorically, he stands in for the audience, while they stand in for the country. No \u201cI\u201d, no \u201dyou\u201d, just \u201dwe\u201d: \u201cWhen we win, the nurse wins, the teacher wins, the doctor wins.\u201d No sooner does he end then there\u2019s a surge of people wanting a word, a handshake, a selfie. His exit from the hall can be measured in quarter-inches. A boy shouts, \u201cChange the world!\u201d and the 70-year-old beckons him over, so the suited entourage halts again. Brown-haired and beaming, Solomon is 12, \u201cbut my teachers say I\u2019m going on 40\u201d. His number one issue is the threat of climate breakdown. \u201cIf Boris gets in, I don\u2019t know what my future or the planet\u2019s future even looks like.\u201d This is a family day out, with his parents driving up from Holmfirth. They\u2019ve been canvassing for Labour and dad Moses admits some of the conversations on the doorstep are tough, especially once the subject is Corbyn. He\u2019s heard it all: weak leadership, Brexit, but most of all anti-semitism. \u201cIt\u2019s the media, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says, and shoots me the kind of look Solomon\u2019s teachers save for the naughty boys. Local Labour councillor, Steve Sweeney, breaks into a grin as wide as the River Calder as he remembers organising a meeting for the Labour leader at Hebden Bridge in May 2017. Over a thousand came to that one rally, so impossibly many that Corbyn had to go outside to deliver his speech a second time. Some latecomers wanted in so badly they stood in the river. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine they caught a word.\u201d \u201cPerhaps no historical phenomenon has been so thoroughly neglected by historians as the crowd,\u201d wrote French scholar George Rude in his classic The Crowd In History. Whether at Bastille in 1789 or Peterloo in 1819, the \u201cfaces in the crowd\u201d were considered not as a \u201cliving and many-sided phenomenon\u201d but \u201can abstract formula\u201d. The activists who thronged in driving rain at Sheffield last month to cheer Corbyn as he went on Question Time: Leaders Special were not doing anything half so dramatic, but they and others have been deluged in condescension. To much of the press, they are little more than \u201cCorbynistas\u201d, bovine hordes lowing against the ideologically impure. Yet those grassroots supporters have called the past half-decade better than most in the Westminster village. As insiders laughed at his leadership chances, it was the growing crowds that showed he was a serious contender. When Labour MPs demanded Corbyn quit, his biggest support came from the crowds mobilising outside parliament. Against press onslaught, Corbyn\u2019s supporters have been his defence. When the polls look poor, his crowds have served as a reminder that anything is possible. For Corbyn himself, they show that he heads a \u201csocial movement\u201d. Over the last few hours of this historic election, their role will be vital. And if Labour lose badly on Thursday night, then one big question on Friday morning will be who and what Corbyn\u2019s crowds will accept. One thing is clear: they are not to be taken for granted. The crowds this campaign would delight any other politician but by Corbyn\u2019s standard they are typically smaller and older. Cold, wet evenings are no friend to the outdoor epic meeting, and the Labour leader is no longer the promising up-and-comer he appeared to be at Glastonbury two years ago. Yet senior advisers still puzzle over why his dire personal ratings have not enjoyed anything like the boost they got in 2017. And for much of this year, some Corbyn-supporting MPs have been privately worrying about something else: dimming enthusiasm among the base, disappointed over his wavering on Brexit and the leadership\u2019s foot-dragging over its anti-semitism crisis, which has been allowed to fester and grow into one of the defining issues of this election. The Guardian\u2019s own evidence backs this up. For this piece, analysts from our data and insight team studied website traffic since the start of 2017, and found that readership for Corbyn-related headlines had tailed off since this spring, sliding below that of all pieces on UK politics. On one of the leading liberal-left news sites in the English-speaking world, the British politician who draws most readers is Tory Boris Johnson. His novelty as prime minister, as well as his wrangling over Brexit are surely two big reasons why, but it also looks as if the thrill is not gone, but may be going. In Mytholmroyd, Labour councillor Roisin Cavanagh has spotted something else to worry her leader. After a decade of austerity, the hard-up voters she canvasses \u201chave lost the ability to believe that things can be different\u201d. She recently met a woman who had lost her home thanks to the bedroom tax and now lived in a small flat. With no room to put up her daughter, she complained of feeling isolated. Asked what she made of the bedroom tax, the woman said simply: \u201cIt\u2019s the system, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what it does to people like me.\u201d On the other side of the same community hall, Sky News are setting up to interview the Labour leader. Armed with three cameras, the crew strive to make a room normally used for the Stay and Play toddler group into a setting fit for a would-be prime minister. The interview with Sophy Ridge goes out next morning, two days after the London Bridge terrorist murders and just before Corbyn gives his key foreign policy speech of the campaign. While the presenter pores over her notes, a set of drawers is rolled out of shot and swapped for a Christmas tree. The camera operators stare down their viewfinders with no sign of festive cheer. They inch the tree back and forth, before glumly agreeing to stick with the drawers. In five minutes, navy-suited Corbyn, his wife Laura Alvarez, his chief strategist Seumas Milne and other members of his entourage will enter and the cameras will roll. This is what election campaigns demand of party leaders: to sweep from one artfully-composed room to another, precision-delivering messages as they go. Except Corbyn doesn\u2019t do slick. Faced with an audience, the Labour leader can be engaging, but on the typical studio ping-pong he is prone to sulk. This trip to Yorkshire follows easily his worst week of the campaign: a front page attack from the chief rabbi for allowing \u201ca new poison\u201d of anti-Jewish racism to enter the party, followed by such a spectacular mauling from the BBC\u2019s in-house pit bull Andrew Neil that Johnson will not be dragged in front of him. A major controversy in this election is whether, as Labour allege, the national broadcaster is failing to hold his opponents to account. \u201cIt hurts because he is my husband and I don\u2019t like seeing him treated this way,\u201d says Alvarez, in rust cardigan and red scarf. \u201cBut really we should all be asking: What is happening to our democracy?\u201d A few days beforehand, I went to Channel 4 in London to watch Corbyn debate other leaders on climate change. It could have been a good night. Johnson had ducked out again, to be replaced with a giant ice sculpture, while the other leaders all had weak-spots. Yet the youngish activists watching in the Channel 4 spin room went from receptive to restive. When Corbyn showed his commitment to forestry by waving his own hard-copy dead-tree report, some moaned. To underline his green credentials, he boasted how rarely he stuck on the central heating, adding, \u201cI\u2019m quite miserable, actually\u201d, prompting well-wisher Matthew Butcher to mutter: \u201cOh, mate \u2013 I did climate comms and the first thing they teach you is never say it\u2019s miserable.\u201d The biggest bafflement was summed up by another Labour-supporting environmentalist: \u201cHe was stood next to a giant fucking melting ice cube \u2013 how could he not once turn to it and say, \u2018What does Boris Johnson think? Let\u2019s ask him.\u2019 An easy goal but he didn\u2019t tap it in.\u201d That lack of attack runs through Labour\u2019s election, from its mushy slogan of \u201cReal change is coming\u201d to whether it is about the NHS or a \u201ctransformative government\u201d, to the confusion over who calls the shots. Some say John McDonnell, formally Labour campaign chair, runs things; others swear it is Corbyn\u2019s former chief of staff Karie Murphy, officially election campaign chief. This Thursday, Labour\u2019s John Healey appeared on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme to pledge an end to rough sleeping \u2013 a \u201cmoral mission\u201d that deserved big billing yet was overshadowed by a commitment from his colleague Angela Rayner to give free breakfasts to all primary pupils. On some mornings, it has felt less a campaign to form the next government and more like an advent calendar. \u201cIt really is \u2018vote Labour and get a free microwave\u2019\u201d, says one frontbencher and Corbyn loyalist, recalling the fat raspberry blown by an adviser to Barack Obama at Ed Miliband\u2019s 2015 campaign. One of New Labour\u2019s signal moments was Gordon Brown\u2019s decision in 2002 to raise National Insurance by a penny and invest in the NHS. Paving the way for that one policy took No 11 well over a year of work. It lured a starch-shirted banker, the now-late Derek Wanless, to chair an independent report that as if by magic reached exactly the conclusion the chancellor desired. In today\u2019s money that programme cost \u00a364bn. By comparison, a fortnight ago shadow chancellor McDonnell said he would spend nearly \u00a360bn to compensate women \u201crobbed\u201d of their pensions. Whatever the merits of that policy, Labour made no attempt beforehand to lay the ground for it and gave little reassurance afterwards on how it could be afforded. In a country that prints its own currency and with borrowing rates near zero, it is affordable; but it is also as if such electoral niceties are beneath them. Two forces are at play here. The first is what Corbyn\u2019s policy chief Andrew Fisher dubbed in his resignation letter this September a \u201clack of professionalism\u201d. The second is a belief held across the new left that the banking crash of 2008-9 effectively crushed the old common sense about how an economy should run, how politicians should look and what they must say. Corbyn\u2019s critics often conflate these distinct forces; the difficulty of his supporters is to avoid the first. \u201cCommon sense is not something rigid and stationary,\u201d wrote the communist Antonio Gramsci, even as his native Italy collapsed into fascism. \u201c[It] creates the folklore of the future, a relatively rigidified phase of popular knowledge in a given time and place.\u201d The struggle, he believed, was to replace it with \u201cgood sense\u201d. To see how that struggle plays out now, look at how Labour and even the Conservatives have shifted since the crash. Kevin Farnsworth, a senior social scientist at the University of York, has fed the two main party manifestos for every election since 1945 through software that assesses similarities and differences between them based on their key concepts and phrases. The manifesto on which Brown lost the 2010 election was far closer in its language and preoccupations to the Tories of that year than to Corbyn\u2019s platform in 2019. Also vast is the conceptual distance between Ed Miliband\u2019s offering in 2015 and the one that followed just two years later, which Farnsworth describes as \u201cthe radical break\u201d. It\u2019s Saturday evening, Corbyn\u2019s last public outing is an NHS rally at Leeds Beckett student union, a venue more used to indie bands and messy discos. The queue outside winds around and around the pavement, while inside Amanda Burns sips at a glass and waits for tonight\u2019s act. Getting others to support Labour is proving far harder than last time, she says, \u201cespecially among lefties. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve got Stockholm syndrome and think their prisoner [Johnson] is their master\u201d. An artist, Burns used to teach at a city school, until it converted to an academy and axed most of the creative arts department. Her \u201cgig buddy\u201d and former MA teacher Rebekka Kill bobs over. Once involved with the Anti-Nazi League, she went off politics for decades \u2013 until in 2015 she spotted Corbyn. \u201cIt\u2019s his integrity. His honesty was just different from what we\u2019d been served up.\u201d Yet ask these activists which way they\u2019ll jump if he goes soon and they expertly reel off the contenders. Rebecca Long-Bailey: nice-seeming, but quiet. Keir Starmer: a \u201ccentrist suit\u201d. Jess Philips: someone nearby makes a vomit noise. Up the backstairs in the dressing room, wedged underneath a rail of coathangers are Corbyn, and his frontbenchers Richard Burgon and Angela Rayner. They sit on some leatherette sofas in a dark brown that must hide an epic history of spills. How do they think this election differs from the last? Corbyn kicks off: \u201cDespite the predictions, it\u2019s not been a one-issue campaign, but an election along many dimensions. That was largely our doing.\u201d But on that one issue of Brexit, how do the Labour leave areas they\u2019re blitzing in these last few days respond? Rayner admits that in her patch of Ashton-under-Lyne voters are \u201cmore despondent than in 2017. They wanted one thing done and it\u2019s not happened \u2013 and they hate us all\u201d. Despite having done about three set-pieces a day every day all over the country for the past four weeks, Corbyn shows no strain, not even a cold. He runs regularly, say advisers, and goes to the gym. A few days back, he was at the Sobell leisure centre near Arsenal\u2019s stadium, when a man flew out of the showers \u201ccompletely naked,\u201d laughs the Labour leader, who was torn between squeamishness and a politician\u2019s civility. \u201cI was like, \u2018please put it away, get a towel\u2019 but he was: \u2018I want to talk to you about my nan\u2019s housing.\u2019\u201d Amid all this, he finds out that Burgon turns 40 next September. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the agenda for next year\u2019s party conference sorted,\u201d says Corbyn, \u201cbut will a mere five days of celebration be enough?\u201d It is a long way from the humourless grandpa image: \u201cMy dears, my friends, let\u2019s go and inspire the waiting masses.\u201d On that front, it is health spokesman Jon Ashworth who wins. He recalls how the NHS was described by its creator Nye Bevan as \u201ca piece of real socialism\u201d and goes on to argue that the new universalist pledges in the manifesto \u2013 for broadband, for housing, for rail \u2013 are straight out of Labour tradition. \u201cWhen people ask how you can afford it,\u201d he bellows, addressing one big question on the doorstep, \u201cask them how amid the rubble and carnage of the second world war did we build an NHS?\u201d The evening ends with the crowd chanting the anthem of Labour in 2019 \u2013 not the Red Flag but \u201cOh, Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. The evening charges up not just the members but the frontbenchers, judging by their buzz in an Italian restaurant afterwards. Alvarez shows pictures of the household cat, El Gato, and frets that for all his slimline good looks he is a Tory, \u201ca selfish individualist\u201d. In her spotted brothel-creepers, Rayner, the self-described \u201ccouncil estate kid\u201d, ribs Milne endlessly about his moneyed background. Over risotto, Corbyn takes a break from worrying about how to get Islington council to bring more services back in-house, to show quite detailed knowledge of how car thieves used to jam a lock, expertise gleaned from when some local youths helped him break into his own car. As the evening breaks up and he prepares for tomorrow\u2019s speeches, he asks if we enjoyed the rally: \u201cLovely atmosphere, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
