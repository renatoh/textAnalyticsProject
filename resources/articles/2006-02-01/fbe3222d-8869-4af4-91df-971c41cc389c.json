Helped by reassuring noises from ratings agency Fitch over the health of the country's banking sector, the Icelandic krona held steady after its 5% fall this week and prompted modest rallies in other currencies that had been vulnerable. The panic selling of the krona, mirrored by sharp falls in share prices on Iceland's stock market, was triggered by a downgrading of the country's debt by Fitch, citing an \"unsustainable\" current account deficit. As dealers drew parallels with the Asian financial crisis of 1997, which began in Thailand and spread quickly to South Korea and Indonesia, the downward pressure on currencies spread from the small country in the North Atlantic to countries as far apart as Hungary, New Zealand, South Africa and Brazil. In recent years, major currencies have moved in relatively tight ranges, leaving adventurous investors searching for higher, but potentially riskier, assets. Iceland's troubles raised doubts about these so-called carry trades: borrowing cheaply in dollars, euros or yen and buying assets in high-yielding currencies such as the krona, the New Zealand dollar or the Hungarian forint. Dealers said memories of the contagion effects of 1997 had prompted a fresh bout of jitters in which investors were eager to bank profits, but that the healthy appetite for risk in financial markets would bring investors back. \"The big unwinding of positions in Iceland had a bit of contagion effect, squeezing out some carry positions but in our view it was more of a position consolidation,\" said Osman Wahid, emerging currencies strategist at JP Morgan in London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
