British fishermen export about 70% of their catch, mainly to continental Europe and Asia. The sharp fall in demand has been a \u201csevere shock\u201d, said Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Organisations. \u201cLike everyone, our members have been stunned by the magnitude of this crisis. It\u2019s a very fluid and dynamic situation, and we\u2019re hoping it\u2019s temporary,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, there are concerns that imports of fish, which amount to 70-80% of the seafood consumed in the UK, could be hampered by pressure on supply chains, including sickness and self-isolation among key workers. Last week, shipping representatives warned ministers that without government support, freight ships will be laid up, leading to a shortage of food and other goods. Frozen fish imports usually arrive in the UK on container ships. The first sign of the crisis in the UK fishing sector was a sudden slump in demand from Asia for shellfish. Deas said: \u201cIn recent years, there has been quite a dependence on the Chinese market for sales of crab, so that\u2019s where it was felt first as exports dried up. \u201cMore recently, there has been the closure of the restaurant and hospitality trade, which has had a big impact on the shellfish trade. It has pretty well collapsed. White fish has been a bit more mixed, but there has certainly been a reduction in demand. The closure of some supermarket fish counters has not been helpful.\u201d Fish markets in the north-east of England, where catches are sold on to suppliers to restaurants, supermarkets and fishmongers, have closed and Peterhead \u2013 the largest market in Europe \u2013 has seen a significant fall in trade. Markets in the south-west of England are open but reporting a slump in prices. Jim Portus of the South Western Fish Producers\u2019 Association said that producers of crabs, prawns and scallops were the \u201ccritical sectors that have no market at all now\u201d. He added: \u201cWe were severely hampered in the first three months of the year by storms and high winds. There wasn\u2019t much meat on the bones at the start of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 fishermen tend to live hand to mouth \u2013 so this is pretty critical economically.\u201d Many trawlers were spending more time in port than usual, said Portus: \u201cThey\u2019re maybe doing three days at sea, three days in port, rather than six days at sea and one day\u2019s rest.\u201d There was a glimmer of recovery in the Chinese market, he said: \u201cIf countries like Italy, Spain and France start to come out of the coronavirus crisis several weeks ahead of the UK, there\u2019s no reason why fishing vessels shouldn\u2019t start ramping up \u2013 but it\u2019s more likely to be a slow buildup than an overnight recovery. Industry representatives are in talks with the government about financial help for the sector. Most fishermen are self-employed and their income is a share of the profits rather than a set rate. \u201cMost will come under the chancellor\u2019s package for self-employed people, but some at the top and the bottom of the range may be excluded,\u201d said Deas. \u201cThe ongoing costs, such as harbour dues and equipment rental, continue even if your boats are tied up. We\u2019re making a case to the government for a bespoke package for the fishing sector.\u201d Johnny Murt, who owns a 25ft boat in Padstow, Cornwall, and supplies lobster and crab to local high-end restaurants and for export, said his market had vanished. \u201cThe lobsters are just starting to move. It\u2019s the start of the season, coming off the back of a really hard winter. By the time we come out of this, we\u2019ll be just about rolling into another winter. I think it will be a year from now before we start to earn any money, and some fishing businesses will crumble.\u201d In Mevagissey, a Cornish fishing village whose picturesque harbour is a big tourist draw, about a dozen boats out of 70 registered in the port were at sea last week. Celia Mitchell, secretary of the Mevagissey Fisherman\u2019s Association, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve just had the worst winter a lot of people can remember, and now this, just as better weather was coming. The harbour is losing a lot of income from both fishing and tourism. It\u2019s looking like a bleak few months ahead.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
