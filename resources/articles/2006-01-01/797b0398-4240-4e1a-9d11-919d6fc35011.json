Jonathan and Robert Maskell broke into the home of 74-year-old widow Anjelica Hallwood with their sister's boyfriend, Dwane Johnston. Her body was found the following day. She had been beaten and strangled, the Old Bailey was told. The brothers and Johnston, 19, all from Edmonton, north London, were cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter. The twins were found guilty of robbery, an offence to which Johnston had already pleaded guilty. Judge Gerald Gordon remanded the three in custody for sentencing on January 31. The court was told the youths thought the pensioner, known as Nana to all of them, had up to \u00a33,000 stashed at her home. They broke in and the twins found just over \u00a31,000, while Johnston hit Mrs Hallwood in the face and put pressure on her throat as he pinned her to the ground. After leaving, they bought a mobile top-up card and a kebab before returning to the party in January 2004. \"Jonathan Maskell asked his mother whether they could leave the party to meet Johnston to get a birthday card from him. The party continued in their absence,\" Anthony Leonard QC, prosecuting, said. The three then went to Mrs Hallwood's home, where Johnston had been staying since leaving prison the previous day after serving a sentence for driving offences. They ransacked the house to find money and in the struggle killed the pensioner, Mr Leonard said. The next morning Mrs Hallwood's daughter, Joan, was unable to get into her mother's house. Johnston arrived and was able to slip the security chain to gain access. They found the house in turmoil and, after being asked to check the grandmother's bedroom, Johnston told Ms Hallwood he thought her mother was dead, Mr Leonard said. In court, the Maskells and Johnston tried to blame the killing on each other. Robert and Jonathan were the sons of the former wife of Mrs Hallwood's son, Peter. Although the Maskells were not blood relatives, they had been treated as grandsons and shown nothing but kindness by Mrs Hallwood. The Maskells had been friends with Johnston since they were 14 when they all attended a school for children with learning difficulties. The twins had been suspected when \u00a3800 was stolen from Mrs Hallwood on a previous occasion, but the family dealt with it themselves rather than contact police. Outside the court this afternoon, Peter Hallwood said he felt a mixture of emotions ranging \"from depression and sadness to extreme anger\". \"I am struggling to cope with the knowledge that the twins and Johnston were capable of doing this,\" he said. \"They are the lowest of the low, cold and callous, and I can't believe they would bite the hand that feeds them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
