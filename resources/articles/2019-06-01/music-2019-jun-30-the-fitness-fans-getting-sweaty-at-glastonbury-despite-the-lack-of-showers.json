Being able to keep fit and healthy is a challenge.\u201d Glastonbury may have a reputation for more hedonistic pursuits than HIIT routines, but that hasn\u2019t deterred festivalgoers such as Jensen from doing what they can to keep in shape. By Saturday morning, he had already completed two 15km runs and did another 10km on Sunday, along with an extensive daily regime of exercises. He is also on a strict diet of juice and soup, and doesn\u2019t plan on having any \u201ccheat days\u201d. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a pretty heavy regime,\u201d he says, \u201cit just doesn\u2019t cut it fully for me. I need weights, I need my bike to ride for my quads,\u201d he says. \u201cI struggle mentally to see the gains I desire without my full exercise equipment, so there can\u2019t be any days off while I\u2019m here.\u201d It helps that there are numerous exercise groups over the weekend, from a 5km organised run on the Thursday (which 105 people took part in), to numerous yoga classes of varying disciplines, from laughing to power ballad. Ali Jackson, a 41-year-old substance misuse worker based in Stoke, is running a 100km ultra marathon with her partner next month, so keeping fit at Glastonbury is essential. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to undo all the hard work,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay as fit as we can while we\u2019re here.\u201d So far, Jackson has taken part in the 5k run and covered five miles in her six-hour litter-picking shift, which started at 6am. She has also brought protein powder with her and has been trying to eat healthily. \u201cThere\u2019s so much lovely food here, it would be easy to go mad,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m on a programme with a nutritionist and he said a week of bingeing could do a lot of damage.\u201d For Carrie Hall, running also has social and practical benefits, considering this is her first time at Glastonbury. \u201cI thought it would be a really cool way to get to see different things,\u201d she says. As well as taking part in the 5km \u2013 one of the highlights of her weekend \u2013 she has also scaled the climbing wall. No mean feat in 27C heat. Becki Clark, a 25-year-old junior doctor, has been running every day so far. Although she has found the heat limiting, she has also managed to play football with her friends. For her, it is not about fitness. \u201cRunning is what I do, it\u2019s how I keep sane, it\u2019s how I deal with stress, how I deal with everything. It\u2019s the best way to start a day.\u201d When Clark was at Glastonbury in 2017, she didn\u2019t run and was left feeling lethargic and stressed. It didn\u2019t help that university exams were looming. \u201cI remember going on a run late on the day I got back and just being so relieved.\u201d It may not be the most conventional Glastonbury activity, but keeping fit clearly has its benefits. There is one downside, though. \u201cThe lack of showers,\u201d says Shaza Brannon, a 35-year-old chartered town planner. After taking part in the 5km on Thursday, she felt she didn\u2019t need one, \u201cjust a wash and I thought I smelt perfectly fine.\u201d However, by Saturday morning, the situation had deteriorated. \u201cMy mates told me I had to have a shower, so my husband sloshed water over my head.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
