Stoke Gifford parish council found itself pitted against heroes including marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe, double gold medalist Kelly Holmes and the former tennis star and television presenter Sue Barker, not to mention the sports minister and the mayor of Bristol. Within hours of it deciding it was unfair to expect residents who do not run to pay for the upkeep of the paths in Little Stoke park, tens of thousands of people had signed a petition calling for the decision to be reversed. There was even talk from some parkrun enthusiasts from other parts of the UK of descending on this bit of green space close to where the M4 and M5 motorways meet to take part in a mass demonstration. However, this Saturday\u2019s Little Stoke parkrun has been cancelled owing to fears that safety may be jeopardised by the number of supporters planning to attend, organisers said. An online statement explained: \u201cThe safety and wellbeing of parkrunners and other park users is paramount and we are very concerned that this might be jeopardised by the volume of people wishing to run at Little Stoke on Saturday. This could easily exceed the safe limit of the park itself.\u201d Stoke Gifford parish council, the first in the world to try to charge parkrun, has stood firm. It insisted it was all for running and would not dream of stopping anyone from taking a casual run around the park. But it argued that the Little Stoke parkrun had become a victim of its own success. From modest beginnings, more than 300 people now take part in the Saturday morning 5km timed race. The chairman of the parish council, Ernest Brown, conceded it was not possible to evaluate the cost of the runners\u2019 impact on the park, but said: \u201cThreehundred feet pounding the paths every Saturday morning does cause extra wear.\u201d He said a football team that used the park had already asked if it could have reduced fees and claimed that parkrun could apply for a grant to keep the event free. Parkrun has become a phenomenon, with the Little Stoke run just one of 850 such events that take place globally. In the UK there have been more than 60,000 parkruns with almost a million competitors. The organisation said it would try to find a way of overturning the decision but is worried that if it does have to pay it will set a precedent that other councils will follow and the ethos of the project will be lost. The chief operating officer of parkrun, Tom Williams, said the movement had enjoyed \u201cunprecedented success in engaging the least active and encouraging them to exercise regularly\u201d. He said: \u201cProviding free weekly access has been fundamental to this and we are disappointed that this opportunity is to be removed for the residents of Little Stoke. \u201cOur aim is to break down barriers to participation in, and delivery of, physical activity and this is consistent across parkruns worldwide, which are all delivered by volunteers and are free to take part in. \u201cImposing a charge at one event is something that contradicts our founding principles and would set a precedent that threatens our future. As a nation we must make a decision about whether we want to be healthier or not.\u201d Radcliffe tweeted that the decision was short-sighted and that parkruns should be free for everyone. Holmes tweeted: James Cracknell, the rowing double Olympic gold medallist, said: \u201cFree running should be exactly that.\u201d The heptathlon champion Kelly Sotherton said she had emailed the council to urge it to back down. Speaking after she picked up an OBE at Windsor Castle, Sue Barker said: \u201cI do feel it\u2019s a shame because in this world now where everyone is being encouraged to eat more healthily, to exercise more, I think it will put a lot of people off. If it is just a money-making thing I hope there\u2019s other ways of doing it. Sport minister Tracey Crouch tweeted: The Bristol mayor, George Ferguson, added: \u201cIt seems an extremely short-sighted decision to me.\u201d The Little Stoke run attracts an average of 186 people a week, and the average 5km run time is 27 minutes and three seconds. It began on 3 November 2012, and since then 5,462 runners, including participants from 331 athletics clubs, have completed a total distance of 158,170km. People like David, who said there was no better way to start the weekend than to run with his wife and son. \u201cThe wonderful people around Little Stoke make this parkrun such an incredible success and deserve to see this event continue to flourish,\u201d he said. Another parkrunner, Ali, said: \u201cLittle Stoke parkrun has given me so much in terms of help with my running but also with my confidence. With everyone being encouraged to get out and exercise more it seems such a perfect way for everyone to do this, young, old, fast, slow, rich or poor. Please do not close this parkrun down, the community needs it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
