The opposition holds an election-winning lead of 52% to the Coalition\u2019s 48% in the two-party preferred stakes, down from 53% a fortnight ago, according to the poll published in the Australian. Another survey, the Morgan poll, which was published on Monday afternoon, showed Labor on 53% (up two points) and the Coalition on 47% (down two points) on the two-party preferred vote, and 37% and 41% in the primary vote respectively. The Newspoll also showed Tony Abbott remains the preferred prime minister over Shorten, and on a separate measure, Abbott\u2019s net approval rating is better than Shorten for the first time in more than a year. After a short-lived post-budget bounce, the Coalition\u2019s primary vote has edged up one percentage point to 41%, while Labor\u2019s has remained steady at 37%. The Greens popularity is up one percentage point to 13%, after the installation of its new leader, Richard Di Natale, less than a month ago. Abbott\u2019s rating as preferred prime minister held steady at 41%. Shorten was the preferred choice of 37%, down three percentage points from two weeks ago, despite a public campaign by the opposition leader to spruik his private member\u2019s bill on same-sex marriage. Shorten\u2019s net satisfaction rating has also plummeted, with the percentage of people being satisfied with his performance falling three points to 32%. His dissatisfaction rating has increased to 50%, giving him a net approval rating of -18%. By contrast, Abbott\u2019s satisfaction rating is down one point to 38%, and his dissatisfaction rating is up one point to 53%. The prime minister\u2019s net approval rating is -15%, higher than Shorten\u2019s rating for the first time in more than a year. Monday night\u2019s Newspoll was based on a survey of 1,169 people, and has a margin of error of three percentage points."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
