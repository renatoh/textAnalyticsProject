Presumably she was trying to appeal to the large number of Latinx people present \u2013 the Culinary Union is Nevada\u2019s largest immigrant organization, and about 54% of its members identify as Latinx. But it\u2019s hard to be sure. One reporter tweeted from the scene: \u201cKlobuchar says that in elementary school Spanish class her name was \u2018Elena\u2019 because she couldn\u2019t roll her r\u2019s\u201d. Which would make sense, if Amy had an \u201cr\u201d in it. Perhaps Klobuchar was just hoping to make amends for earlier this month when she forgot the name of the Mexican president, right after voting for his trade treaty? This grasp at \u201crelatability\u201d is cringe-worthy \u2013 the desperate, out-of-touch candidate trying so hard to resonate that they end up accidentally proving their own ignorance. But we\u2019ve seen this all before, Klobuchar is not alone. Here are some of the worst attempts from her opponents in the race (so far). When Joe Biden tried to appeal to women Before November\u2019s Democratic presidential candidates\u2019 debate in Georgia, Joe Biden was on a good footing. He was ahead in the polls. And despite allegations of unwanted touching, and repeated calls for him to apologize over his intrusive questioning of Anita Hill in the 90s, he still had strong support among women. And then this happened. In response to a question about domestic violence, Biden highlighted an interesting tactic: domestic violence should be punched. Repeatedly, he said. On stage in Atlanta, Biden said: \u201cNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense and that rarely ever occurs. And so we have to just change the culture. Period. And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it.\u201d Ouch. When Elizabeth Warren tried to appeal to Native Americans In 2012, reports surfaced that Elizabeth Warren was touted as a Native American faculty member while working at Harvard in the 90s. Then, in 2018, after years of justifying that she was indeed American Indian, Elizabeth Warren came out with the proof. She brandished DNA test results which revealed that she \u2013 wait for it \u2013 maybe had a Native American ancestor six to ten generations ago. All the American Indians who have been asked for their 23andMe results before being subjected to discrimination sighed a breath of relief that a presidential candidate finally understood their lived experience (JK). And then we all remembered that race is a social construct and not a biological reality \u2013 oh, and that DNA tests really aren\u2019t that reliable. Warren has since apologized. But it was a real pie-in-the-face moment. When Bloomberg tried to appeal to farmers I don\u2019t know about you, but if I was a billionaire trying to appeal to working-class America, I might not do it by suggesting that they\u2019re all commoners with less brain matter than me. But then again, maybe I\u2019m just not as smart as Mike Bloomberg \u2013 who this week said he could probably \u201cteach anybody to be a farmer\u201d \u2013 despite the fact that he is not a farmer. Wow, very down to earth. When Buttigieg tries to appeal to \u2026 anyone Pete Buttigieg would bring chips and salsa to the cookout. He eats beef jerky on the campaign trail. And he eats a cinnamon roll like a chicken wing. And yes, he once intimated that having a difficult to pronounce surname helps him to understand racism. Which leaves a lot of people wondering: just who is Mayor Pete trying to appeal to? Maybe sometimes better to stick to what you know \u2013 like being white and bland? Sorry, Mayo\u2019 Pete."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
