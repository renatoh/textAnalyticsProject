Aperture settings, known as f-stops, are found on the lens barrel. Have a look at these close-up pictures of the lens barrel (above) and shutter-speed dial (below) from an older, manual film camera. On this lens, f/2.8 is the largest aperture and f/32 the smallest. Each change in f-stop setting halves/doubles the light reaching the camera sensor (although the aperture's actual size depends on the lens). The numbers on the shutter-speed dial are the speeds available on this camera: from one second to 1/4,000th of a second. A slow shutter speed will blur movement; a fast shutter speed will freeze action. Each change doubles/halves the shutter speed, and its effect on exposure is equal to each change in f-stop. So each time you adjust the shutter-speed dial, you'll need to adjust the aperture setting to compensate. If you want to use a slower shutter speed (moving from 1/250th of a second to 1/30th, for example), you will need to move three steps along the aperture scale (from 4 to 11) to ensure the same amount of light reaches the camera's sensor. If you want to freeze the action, the opposite applies. The ISO settings (left) also double or half the exposure value. So all three variables \u2013 ISO, aperture and shutter speed \u2013 relate to each other."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
