One is a millionaire teenage football prodigy, the other a cricketer who, in his mid-twenties, is finally winning his personal battle of the bulge. But both inspire hope. They play sport as though they were in the local park with friends. In another time, you could imagine them charging uncomplainingly towards enemy fire on some blasted battlefield or working vigorously on the land. For there is something fearless and uncomplicated in everything they do: Rooney becoming, at the age of 17 years and 317 days, the youngest player ever to score for England; Flintoff bludgeoning the South African bowlers on the way to inspiring England to an improbable victory at the Oval in the final Test of the summer. Off the field, both seem baffled by the fuss. When asked why the South Africans sledged him so remorselessly, Flintoff replied: 'I really don't know. Perhaps they don't think I'm any good.' But Flintoff is good, very good and, like Rooney, has the potential to perform the kind of feats that, as last week, lift the spirits of a nation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
