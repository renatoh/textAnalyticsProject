Eight years ago, its largest mine shut down, leaving behind unemployment and a mile-wide empty crater next to the downtown core. But the community in the French-speaking province of Quebec has also been forced to reckon with that fact that it shares its name with a notorious cancer-causing mineral banned in nearly 60 countries. Amid growing frustration from residents, officials have launched a bold plan: renaming the town. \u201cThere is really a negative perception around [it],\u201d Asbestos\u2019s mayor, Hugues Grimard, told CBC News. \u201cWe have lost businesses that don\u2019t want to establish themselves here because of the name.\u201d For nearly 150 years, the Jeffrey asbestos mine in the town east of Montreal was one of the world\u2019s largest \u2013 and the biggest employer in town. Over the years, however, as experts learned of the dangers associated with asbestos, the town\u2019s name has become somewhat tarnished. \u201cThe word asbestos unfortunately doesn\u2019t have a good connotation, especially for anglophones, and it\u2019s hindering the city\u2019s plans to develop external economic relations,\u201d said the town in a Facebook post, prompting some residents to bristle at the idea of changing the town\u2019s name for the benefit of English-speaking businesspeople. Others expressed frustration that the town was abandoning its heritage. In a follow-up post, the town, acknowledged that the proposed change came as a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d\u2013 but was nonetheless important for the economic survival of the community and future generations. The new effort marks the second time Asbestos has tried to rebrand itself. In 2006 town councillors proposed the idea but received little support. While the current attempt will probably cost nearly $100,000, there is hope the contest will bring attention \u2013 and potential investment \u2013 to the region. Some residents have advocated names that pay homage to the region, including City of Three Lakes. Other suggested reaching out to Indigenous groups to guidance on the traditional names for the region. Most, however, have been tongue-in-cheek, including Poumontousse (a portmanteau of \u201clung\u201d and \u201ccough\u201d), the Hole and Asbestos 2.0. Asbestos plans to hold public meetings in early January before voting on the new name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
