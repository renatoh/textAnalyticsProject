The full federal court is hearing the challenges to the elections of Liberal MP Gladys Liu in Chisholm and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in Kooyong over three days. The cases have been brought against the two candidates by climate campaigner Vanessa Garbett and unsuccessful independent Kooyong candidate Oliver Yates. On Wednesday, Simon Frost, who authorised the signs, said under questioning from Lisa De Ferrari, the barrister for the applicants, that the two signs \u2013 one in traditional Chinese characters, and one in simplified Chinese characters \u2013 were intended to appear as though they were AEC corflutes. The signs that were used in seven electorates in Victoria said, according to an English translation, that the \u201ccorrect way to vote\u201d was to put 1 next to the Liberal candidate. \u201cYou intended to convey the impression that this was an AEC corflute, didn\u2019t you?\u201d De Ferrari asked. Frost, now an adviser to Frydenberg, took a long pause before replying: \u201cIt was similar to the AEC colours, yes.\u201d \u201cSo the answer to my question is yes?\u201d De Ferrari pressed. \u201cYes,\u201d Frost replied. Frost had already confirmed that the signs were intended to say \u201cto make your vote count\u201d but the meaning was lost in translation to \u201cthe correct way to vote\u201d. He said on Thursday it \u201ccould be\u201d a problem that the signs said different words than he authorised. He also conceded he had not thought at the time about whether the signs were likely to mislead or deceive voters. He told the court that the signs were proof-read the day before the election in May but the mistake was not picked up. He indicated the Liberal candidate for Hotham, George Hua, also proof-read the signs before the election. On the day of the election, Frost said he became aware of concerns about the signs once the AEC tweeted replies to people raising issue with the signs, but decided the Liberal party\u2019s opponents were merely making a political point out of the signs. He said at no point on election day did Frydenberg or Liu contact him about the signs, and there would have been no time to print off and distribute more than 500 of the new signs with the correct wording through seven Victorian electorates on election day. De Ferrari said the ruling being sought is to void the election result in both electorates, causing byelections, which would come at a cost, but the principle was more important. \u201c[It] would put a stop to a developing and illegal practice that is really troubling,\u201d she said. \u201cThe principle is too important to have those considerations of practical inconvenience take over.\u201d The hearing continues. \u2022 This story was amended on 7 November 2019 to correct the name of the petitioner Vanessa Garbett. The petition was originally lodged under a different name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
