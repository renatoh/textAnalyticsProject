The crime saga, starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, was named 2019\u2019s best film, following in the footsteps of Green Book last year which went on to win the Academy award for best picture. \u201cWe are thrilled to award The Irishman as our best film,\u201d said the NBR president, Annie Schulhof, in a statement. \u201cMartin Scorsese\u2019s masterful mob epic is a rich, moving, beautifully textured movie that represents the best in what cinema can be.\u201d Steven Zaillian also picked up the prize for best adapted screenplay for the film. But Scorsese missed out on the award for best director which instead went to Quentin Tarantino for his 60s-set hit Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. The lead acting prizes were handed to Adam Sandler for the indie thriller Uncut Gems and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger for the musical biopic Judy. Supporting awards were given to Brad Pitt for Once Upon A Time in Hollywood and Kathy Bates for Clint Eastwood\u2019s Richard Jewell. The announcement arrives the day after Netflix also triumphed at the Gotham awards, with Noah Baumbach\u2019s divorce drama Marriage Story taking top prizes for best feature and best actor. Next week sees the Golden Globe nominations unveiled. The National Board of Review is a New York-based organisation made up of \u201ca select group of knowledgeable film enthusiasts, academics, and film-makers\u201d.
