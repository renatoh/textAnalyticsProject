The burden of regulation, having risen, should now fall - so that companies can focus on driving up productivity. Savings, which Gordon Brown has penalised, should now be encouraged - so that people can feel secure as they approach retirement. Most of all, the government needs to accept that real reform of the public services is required to deliver the improvements everyone wants to see. Labour's 60 tax rises and extra spending have not delivered the higher standards we were promised in return. We need to leave public service professionals free to manage. And we need to make them accountable to choices made not by bureaucrats but by the people they chose to serve. Liberal Democrats The Liberal Democrats would tax incomes over \u00a3100,000 a year at 50%. We would also scrap the unfair council tax and replace it with a local income tax based on ability to pay. Money raised from taxing incomes over \u00a3100k at 50% would pay for three things only: \u00b7 Scraping tuition and top-up fees for students \u00b7 Introducing free personal care for the elderly \u00b7 Keeping down the rate of local taxes We would also raise around \u00a35bn by switching money from lower priority programmes to our priorities, such as by cutting the DTI budget. We would spend that money on the people and frontline services who need it the most. Caroline Lucas, Green party The Green party would: \u00b7 Benefit low and average earners by abolishing VAT and increasing income tax on our highest earners \u00b7 Introduce a non-means-tested citizens' income to replace existing benefits \u00b7 Scrap means-testing for pensioners \u00b7 Abolish tuition fees and reintroduce student grants, funded from taxation \u00b7 Use fuel tax to fund an energy efficiency programme to reduce domestic energy use by 30% within 10 years &amp;149; Put 6p on a litre of petrol, but abolish tax discs, leaving typical motorists with smaller cars \u00a330 a year better off \u00b7 End aviation's \u00a39.2bn annual tax break and scrap the \u00a330bn roads programme, to fund public transport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
