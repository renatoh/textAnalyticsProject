The real genius of this stage version of Michael Morpurgo's novel, first seen at the National in 2007, lies in the work of the Handspring Puppet Company's Basil Jones and Adrian Kohler. They have created, out of skeletal bamboo frames and internal hinges, the most plausible and expressive quadrupeds ever to have graced the London stage. But, seeing the show a second time, I became more aware of the gulf between the sophistication of the puppetry and the one-dimensionality of the human beings. Nick Stafford's adaptation inevitably abandons the horse's-eye-view of Morpurgo's novel to give us a more objective vision of Albert's pursuit of his equine friend, Joey, across the scarred French battlefields of the 1914-18 war. But Albert remains a cipher and the play never pursues, as Peter Shaffer's Equus does, the disturbing implications of the adolescent hero's horse-worship. For all the echoes of Oh, What a Lovely War! in the use of ballad-song to counterpoint military devastation, the show never acquires the emotional resonance of Joan Littlewood's great prototype. All the memorable moments of Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris's production are the product of the superlative puppetry. At one point, Joey is magically transformed from a skittering foal into a bucking, rearing, grown-up horse. Later, a tank menacingly rolls across the stage like an armour-plated behemoth. Mere humans such as Kit Harington's Albert, Colin Mace's surly father and Patrick O'Kane's sympathetic German are dwarfed by the massive technical ingenuity on display. The show has adapted perfectly well to the New London stage, but, in essence, it signifies a return to the Victorian theatre of spectacle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
