Croft did not concede a run until his 33rd ball but it was early evening before he was rewarded when an out-of-sorts Ian Harvey drove airily to mid-off. Croft had come on half an hour before lunch and twirled until the close. Thanks to Jon Lewis the home side took the early initiative. Lewis whipped out the last four Glamorgan wickets in 20 balls at a cost of four runs to finish with five for 66. Gloucestershire prospered while Phil Weston and Tim Hancock were adding 93 for the second wicket and in the afternoon Matt Windows looked in wonderful form before pulling lazily to mid-wicket. But as Glamorgan worked their way down the order, the fact that they merely saved the follow-on was applauded by some of the Bristol faithful. It took Alex Gidman, with Jack Russell bobbing and weaving, to restore the balance of a fascinating game. Gidman's first fifty of the season came with an imperious crack to the point boundary off Alex Wharf, and though Russell fell to Croft before the close there is still everything to play for. These two counties are pressing hard for the third promotion spot in the Second Division and Northamptonshire, the team currently in second place, enhanced their chances against Derbyshire, bowled out for 138 before Northants cruised to 224 for one, Mike Hussey undefeated on 103 and Phil Jaques 99 not out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
