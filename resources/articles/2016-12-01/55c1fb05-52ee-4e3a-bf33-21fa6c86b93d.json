Chris Dry got the Blitzboks off to a flyer, finishing off a fine move from halfway to touch down in the corner. Branco du Preez missed the conversion. England hit back through Richard de Carpentier, who covered half the pitch to score under the posts. Tom Mitchell\u2019s conversion gave England a 7-5 lead. Dan Norton then touched down out wide for his 225th career try as Simon Amor\u2019s men extended their lead before Rosko Specman put the hosts back on level terms early in the second period. England replied through Ruaridh McConnochie\u2019s try after pressure had helped to free up space on the left. Mitchell extended his side\u2019s lead with the extras. But a yellow card for Norton for a high tackle gave South Africa a one-man advantage with 15 seconds remaining and Werner Kok took full advantage with a late try. But Geduld failed to level things up with the kick, which would have forced extra time. Mitchell, the England captain, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a hell of a tough tournament. I am so proud of the boys. It was an amazing effort, . We trained so hard over the summer and this moment makes it all worth it.\u201d England had beaten Fiji 31-26 in the quarter-finals and Scotland 33-14 in the semi-finals; South Africa earned a 14-7 victory over New Zealand to reach the final. Australia completed a disappointing tournament by losing 21-17 to Argentina in the consolation semi-finals. Australia started the day with a 42-12 win over Uganda but failed to apply critical pressure against the South Americans when they had the advantage. Andy Friend, the coach, said \u201cWe made too many simple errors in our game against Argentina. When we should be showing composure, we\u2019re not. We are not working together as a unit at the moment which is disappointing. \u201cWe said at the start of this year that we wanted to make the quarter-finals of every tournament. We didn\u2019t make this one, therefore it is unacceptable.\u201d Australia\u2019s suffered big defeats to the US and South Africa on the first day of the tournament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
