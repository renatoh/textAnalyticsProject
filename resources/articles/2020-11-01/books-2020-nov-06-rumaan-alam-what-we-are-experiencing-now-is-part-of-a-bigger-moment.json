Clay, a professor and critic who \u201cwanted to be asked to write for the New York Times Book Review but didn\u2019t want to actually write anything\u201d, is on holiday on Long Island with his wife Amanda, an executive who \u201cwanted her colleagues to need her as God wants people to keep praying\u201d, and their children Archie and Rose. Late one night, there is a knock at the door of their Airbnb: GH and Ruth, the elderly black owners of the house, have just witnessed a mysterious power outage in New York and could they please come inside? Then comes the sound: \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear such a noise; you experienced it, endured it, survived it, witnessed it. You could fairly say that their lives could be divided into two: the period before they\u2019d heard that noise and the period after.\u201d Like much in the novel, the noise is never explained. But this is what makes Leave the World Behind so frightening: \u201cOur need to know stems from us as a species always looking for authority, for answers, for leaders \u2013 for parents, fundamentally,\u201d Alam says. \u201cWe just want to be told what to do and when we aren\u2019t, it is scary. We\u2019ve always needed to know.\u201d As the author of a book about people trapped inside a house by a huge event, desperate for information, Alam is a curious prophet. Leave the World Behind has already been optioned by Netflix with Julia Roberts set to play Amanda who, anxious and babbling in her uselessness, blurts out: \u201cYou know, you look a little like Denzel Washington,\u201d to GH, who will be played by Denzel Washington. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see that the chosen metaphor \u2013 isolation inside the domestic space \u2013 would become our reality. But what we are experiencing now is part of a bigger moment, there has been a feeling of discomfort for a while,\u201d Alam says. \u201cThe notion that our institutions are less stable than we thought, in the UK, in the US, around the world \u2013 this moment is longer than we want to believe. Things are so crazy now that it is hard for us to isolate the shooting of the archduke, the thing that will become the narrative of history.\u201d Alam has an almost anthropological eye for the absurdities of the upper-middle class, for the blindness of white people. \u201cThis didn\u2019t seem to her like the sort of house where black people lived,\u201d Amanda thinks when GH knocks on the door, then wonders what she means. Reassured by the feel of his Vermont stone countertops, GH is certain of their survival due to his wine collection and stash of energy bars. Amanda orders Clay to fill a bath with water, having a vague memory of this being helpful in emergencies. The adults retreat to the hot tub to drink vodka and start composing the anecdotes they will tell when this is all over \u2013 not knowing that it is just the beginning. Alam \u2013 who \u201cknows to fill the bath but our drain doesn\u2019t work, so we\u2019d be screwed\u201d \u2013 lives in Brooklyn with his husband David Land, a photographer, and their two adopted sons, Simon and Xavier. Four years ago, many reviewers seemed surprised that Rich and Pretty, Alam\u2019s incisive portrait of female friendship in upper-middle class America, could be written by a gay Bangladeshi-American man. His 2018 follow-up, That Kind of Mother, about a white woman who adopts her black nanny\u2019s child, similarly confused them. (\u201cAre you actually a woman?\u201d one interviewer asked him.) Alam\u2019s mother and father, a paediatrician and architect respectively, moved from Bangladesh to Washington DC in the 1970s. Alam grew up ensconced in the heart of upper-middle class white society in Reagan\u2019s America. Almost all the kids in his school were white. \u201cMy parents valued the American dream. They valued raising us as Americans. And I don\u2019t mean to suggest any failing on their part, it was just like that when I was growing up,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would go to Bangladesh maybe once every three or four years, and I had to confront the fact that it was meaningful for my parents to be there while I was missing peanut butter and jelly. I wouldn\u2019t want to eat the food. I couldn\u2019t understand what anyone was saying to me. I didn\u2019t belong there. It\u2019s a strange thing to not really belong in this place that your parents still belong to, while always being reminded that you don\u2019t belong at home.\u201d He went to Oberlin College to study English, where he read \u201cthe genteel middle-class novels of the 80s, books by Lorrie Moore and Ann Beattie. That\u2019s how I understood fiction to work. And so that\u2019s what I do.\u201d \u201cI think, at least in this country, we have a very literal way of reading,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you simply throw your voice outside of your own body, it disorients the reader. You know, \u2018Oh, this man couldn\u2019t possibly feel as this fictionalised woman is describing.\u2019 I don\u2019t know when we got so essentialist. I\u2019m frustrated at the idea that somebody who looks the way I do would be expected to write a certain kind of book.\u201d Writing about white women \u2013 arguably the dominant perspective in publishing \u2013 is a kind of rebellion for Alam, \u201ca silly, very minor rebellion on my part, but it is\u201d. He describes the #OwnVoices movement, which argues that writers should not write about cultural backgrounds outside of their own, as \u201cvery well intentioned\u201d, but aside from the implications for his own career, it is not the answer. \u201cThere is no question that publishing is extraordinarily white to its detriment, that it is intellectually incurious about establishing a literature that really reflects America. But art thrives when there are no parameters. And inequity must be addressed with capital. Publishing assistants need to be paid more. New people will then enter the business and show new readers that books are urgent and exciting, not rarefied and distant. \u201cIndividual writers can\u2019t fix that. We will have parity when a young black writer gets a big advance and writes a totally fine book that doesn\u2019t really perform well, and still gets more money to write a second and third. Because it takes time! Yeah, it did for Zadie Smith, but you shouldn\u2019t have to be Zadie Smith.\u201d Leave the World Behind was influenced by Jordan Peele\u2019s film Get Out, apparent in Alam\u2019s acuity on whiteness. But the closest literary comparison could be Shirley Jackson, whose cold, detached voice can be heard in Alam\u2019s narrator when we are shown glimpses of what is happening in the wider world. All the babies in one neonatal unit die when the power goes out. Passengers suffocate on a subway train stalled under the Hudson River. \u201cPeople locked doors and windows and played board games with their families, though a mother in St Charles, Maryland, drowned her two daughters in the bathtub, which struck her as far more sensible than a round of Chutes and Ladders,\u201d Alam writes. \u201cThat game required neither skill nor strategy; all it had to teach was that life was mostly unearned advantage or devastating fall. It took unimaginable courage to kill your children. Few people could manage it.\u201d It is this authorial voice that makes him call his own novel \u201cold-fashioned\u201d. \u201cIt is very different to what is in style right now, you know these novels where the third-person is almost the first, like Rachel Cusk or Ben Lerner.\u201d It is what children experience during a bedtime story, \u201cthe pure pleasure of being told: this is the world. It is such a relief to have the book tell you that a plane crashed in Minnesota or that there was a hurricane somewhere else, because you get the rush of knowing when the characters don\u2019t.\u201d In the summer of 2017, Alam and his family went on holiday, staying in a house that inspired Leave the World Behind. That winter, while writing in an apartment borrowed from his friends, the author Laura Lippman and The Wire creator David Simon, he found himself daydreaming of the house, of idle days in the pool. He wrote half a draft for Leave the World Behind in a week, and finished it in three. Alam does much of his writing away from home, \u201cbecause if I am writing at home, I am also folding laundry, making spaghetti, playing with Lego\u201d. He always wanted to be a parent and has written touchingly about fatherhood, as well as being stopped in the street by women who want to praise him for spending time with his children. \u201cPresumably these women imagined a wife I don\u2019t have, at home enjoying some \u2018me time\u2019,\u201d he once wrote. \u201cI actually have no idea if Ian McEwan or Salman Rushdie have children,\u201d he says. \u201cNow maybe that is private for them, but I think being a father has been enriching for my work, I\u2019ve found it really clarifying. There\u2019s a contradiction there, though, because in order to work I have to completely neglect my parental responsibilities. I am aware that most of my female colleagues would feel that going to a hotel to write would make them seem monstrous.\u201d As the father of two black boys, Alam has confronted \u201cthe complicated moral imperative\u201d of talking to his children about racism. \u201cTelling the kids about the news feels like an act of child abuse; not telling the kids about the news does too,\u201d he wrote, not long after the death of George Floyd in May. \u201cChildhood ends very early for our black and brown children in this country,\u201d he says. \u201cPartly because it has to, because you must prepare them for how to navigate a world that will not see them as adorable little children any more. I would be doing them a disservice if I didn\u2019t talk to them.\u201d And if he has any optimism, it stems from what he sees in his children: \u201cYoung people understand the complexity behind Black Lives Matter, whereas older people see a conversation about race as being about grievance and opportunity. There is a certain kind of older person who will say that if you\u2019re good, nothing bad will happen to you. That\u2019s patently untrue, obviously.\u201d Sixteen-year-olds should be allowed to vote, and the rule that says the US president must be older than 35 should be changed to under 35, he thinks: \u201cAll of the entrenched political power in the planet today, will all be dead in, God willing, five years. That hugely significant decisions are in the hands of people who have no particular stake in them is totally absurd.\u201d If anything unites Alam\u2019s three novels, it is his interest in the ways we fail to comprehend one another, the ways in which forces such as class and race separate us. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t that connected to one another,\u201d he writes, in Leave the World Behind. \u201cTerrible things happened constantly and never prevented you from going out for ice cream or celebrating birthdays or going to the movies or paying your taxes or fucking your wife or worrying about the mortgage.\u201d This is his most ambitious novel, he thinks. \u201cAnita Brookner is one of my favourite writers, but some readers would say all of her novels are essentially indistinguishable from one another. Then there are writers like Jennifer Egan, where every novel is an experiment. I aspire to be like Egan, and then find myself writing like Brookner. The fear is, are you just a one-trick pony? I don\u2019t know. Does every writer feel that?\u201d he worries. Then he smiles with a tinge of menace. \u201cIf anything, I have learned to frustrate the reader. I hope people realise that you can\u2019t make sense of it. You wouldn\u2019t. And that is what is chilling.\u201d \u2022 Leave the World Behind is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a314.99) on 12 November. To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
