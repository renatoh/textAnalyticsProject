For five long years, the money men have done everything possible to lose friends and alienate people. So the hour is ripe for the money women. In promoting Fed Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen to the top job, Barack Obama is creating the most powerful female in financial history. Yellen has plenty of qualifications besides her sex, of course, with a career taking in Harvard, the LSE and government service; but gender could be material too. Iceland was the basket case of a bust world in 2008, after testosterone-pumped men \u2013 who had their uses on wind-whipped trawlers \u2013 switched to finance and skippered a nation on to the rocks.
