Jersey-based Stanley Gibbons, founded in 1856, said pre-tax profits rose 42% to \u00a31.7m after the values of 100 of the world's most frequently traded stamps rose 10% over the past year. Annual sales broke through the \u00a310m barrier after the group exploited investors' desire to seek havens for their savings outside the stock market. In 1998, the largest known block of Penny Black stamps, postmarked May 6 1840, pictured above, fetched \u00a3220,000 when auctioned by Stanley Gibbons in London. The firm also says it has joined with a \"global bank\" to create a fund for investors in the stamp market."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
