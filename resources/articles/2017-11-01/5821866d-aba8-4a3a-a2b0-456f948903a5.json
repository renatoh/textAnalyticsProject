Paul Ashton lived among the Cistercian monks on the private island off the Pembrokeshire coast in south-west Wales as police searched for him after finding thousands of images of child abuse on his computer. Ashton was finally found after his image appeared on a Crimestoppers Most Wanted gallery. Caldey Abbey is at the centre of a scandal after the Guardian revealed a string of allegations against a monk called Thaddeus Kotik dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. The abbey has been keen to emphasise that the Kotik allegations are of a historical nature and no members of the current community were on the island at the time. But victims claim there is at least one monk still alive who knew Kotik and say the abbot himself knew Kotik from 1990, two years before the monk died in 1992. The fact that Ashton, a suspected sex offender wanted by the police, was able to live at the abbey so recently and for so long will cause huge concern. The current head of the abbey, Daniel van Santvoort, has been abbot since 1999. Following the Guardian\u2019s revelations about Kotik, whistle-blowers came forward to describe how Ashton lived on the island under the name Robert Judd. Ashton had been arrested by police in West Sussex in 2004 when officers executed a warrant at his address in Bracklesham Bay. He was given bail while police examined his computers. Officers found more than 5,000 images of children but he had vanished when they returned. At that time, a man in his 50s calling himself Robert appeared on Caldey. Whistleblowers said Ashton arrived on the island as a monastery guest in 2004 but stayed and moved in. \u201cWhen Robert arrived, he offered to help and made himself indispensable,\u201d a whistleblower said. \u201cHe operated the island\u2019s satellite internet and phone system, managed online accommodation bookings and the accounts and worked in the mail room. He put himself in an ideal position.\u201d They said that \u201cRobert\u201d changed his phone number frequently, encrypted his emails and never left the island. In May 2011, \u201cRobert\u201d further aroused the suspicion of the whistleblower by emailing him that he had \u201cmet another family\u201d that included two young boys on the island and had invited them to his private quarters in the monastery. Curious and worried, the whistleblower began investigating Ashton and discovered that a man called James Robert Judd was named as a director of a cleaning company called St Martins of Caldey, according to Companies House records. The whistleblower carried on investigating. \u201c I just knew in my gut that something was wrong,\u201d they said. Eventually an image appearing to be Robert was found on the Crimestoppers site. It named him as Paul Ashton. \u201cOne evening we had a phone call telling us to look at a website and there [Robert] was, on the most wanted list,\u201d he said. \u201cI saved and printed the photo, showed it to the abbot and asked him who it was. He said: \u2018That\u2019s Robert of course.\u2019 I asked if he was absolutely sure and he said: \u2018Yes without a doubt\u2019.\u201d Whistleblowers have passed on photographs they took of plainclothes police officers escorting Ashton to the boat Caldey Island II beside the island on 6 July 2011. At Chichester crown court on 1 March, Ashton admitted possessing more than 5,000 indecent images of children and was jailed for 30 months. The court was told he was found after an anonymous call was made to the Crimestoppers charity. It heard that South Wales police arrested him in relation to the Sussex inquiry \u2013 and said that more computer equipment containing further images were found on his Caldey Island computers. Speaking after Ashton\u2019s conviction, DC David Midgley, of West Sussex CID, said: \u201cCredit must go to the anonymous informant to Crimestoppers who became suspicious and rang in. Thanks to their actions, Ashton was finally brought to justice after spending nearly eight years in hiding. \u201cIn each image, a child was a victim of crime. The length of the sentence shows how the justice system will punish those who download indecent images of children.\u201d The Guardian has sought comment from van Santvoort who is believed to be in France but has not yet received a reply. Six women sued the abbey over the allegations against Kotik and another seven women have now come forward to the Guardian since the article exposed the offender last Saturday. The victims have welcomed calls for an inquiry into the protection of child sex offenders on the island. Do you know more?
