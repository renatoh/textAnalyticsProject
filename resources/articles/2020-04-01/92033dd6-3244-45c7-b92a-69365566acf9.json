The 25-year-old registered a career-best 25 last season with a further six for England. While Sterling has also managed four international goals in 2019-20, 35 is his ideal tally for Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, having failed to add to the 20 in his last 12 appearances. \u201cI would say probably I\u2019m about 15 goals off where I want to be,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cThose are the targets, to try and create good numbers but at the same time not just have numbers to have numbers. \u201cYou want to have trophies to back up the season because 10 years from now you can score a lot of goals, but if I can\u2019t look back on those goals as being important for my team and having a great value then those goals were pointless. It is [about] trying to contribute as much as I can but at the end of the season have some medals to show for it.\u201d Sterling joined from Liverpool in summer 2015. \u201cDuring my time at City, the most important thing I have learned is the value of winning,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore it was, if I won a game then it was good and if I lost a game, I was disappointed, but it doesn\u2019t burn you as much. Now, if we lose one game in 15 at City you wouldn\u2019t like to be in the dressing room, it is like the worst thing in the world has happened. \u201cI think that is a great surrounding and thing to be in, that nobody wants to lose or accepts losing. That is the biggest thing I have learned since I have been there and is something that I carry with me, not just in football but in anything I do, just that winning mentality and to constantly not take defeat for an answer.\u201d City are the reigning champions and have claimed six of the last seven available domestic trophies. Yet Sterling believes they can still improve. \u201cIt is a team where there is not a lot of egos, even on the pitch everyone wants to do their best,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cCollectively we have the same ambitions, to win competitions and win as many as we can, so it reflects on what the manager [Pep Guardiola] is trying to do and the players are taking it on board superbly well. I think we still have another level to go.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
