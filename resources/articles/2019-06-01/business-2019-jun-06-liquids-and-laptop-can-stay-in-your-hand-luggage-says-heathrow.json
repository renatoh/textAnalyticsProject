Following successful trials of the new equipment, the UK\u2019s biggest airport plans to spend \u00a350m on new scanners across its four terminals by 2022. The computed tomography (CT) scanners, used in hospitals to scan patients, produce more detailed images that allow security staff to assess cabin bags with electronic equipment and liquids inside. The technology is expected to lead to a relaxation of current rules, which state that passengers can only carry liquids such as toiletries or medicine in individual containers of 100ml or less, with the items placed in a separate, clear plastic bag to pass through security. The changes should cut queuing times, as well as reduce plastic waste. There are hopes that the improved technology could potentially end the liquids ban altogether. However, abolition would likely require the scanners to be installed at all airports, an expensive process that could take several years beyond Heathrow\u2019s 2022 target. The CT technology is used at some airports in Europe and the US \u2013 including Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport and JFK in New York \u2013 but Heathrow was the first UK airport to install the scanners, which it started testing in 2017. The Department for Transport is planning to trial the scanners at other UK airports this summer. The aviation minister, Baroness Vere, said: \u201cPassenger safety remains our top priority and this programme clearly shows the huge importance we place on security. \u201cThis innovative new equipment will ensure Heathrow continues to provide a safe and smooth travel experience for passengers, as we look to roll out this new screening technology at airports across the country.\u201d Heathrow\u2019s chief operations officer, Chris Garton, added: \u201cThis cutting-edge equipment will not only keep the airport safe with the latest technology, but will mean that our future passengers can keep their focus on getting on with their journeys and spend less time preparing for security screening.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
