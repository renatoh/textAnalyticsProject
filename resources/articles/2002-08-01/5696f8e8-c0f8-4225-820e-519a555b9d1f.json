American stopped serving children's meals on 6 August as part of a cost-cutting exercise that has also seen the last of its seafood platter, though other special meals have not been affected. Children are now offered the same meals as their parents, which also means that child meals are not served before other passengers on the plane. 'There just wasn't the demand,' said an American Airlines spokesman. 'We have tried to eliminate items that don't add value to the travel experience.' Simon Evans, chief executive of the passenger watchdog group the Air Transport Users Council, said: 'I am surprised, especially that they are saying there is no demand for it. The provision of meals for children is a strong selling point among airlines.' Virgin Atlantic, for example, said it served 122,621 child meals and 5,536 baby meals in 2001, and that they were very much in demand. British Airways added that families with children constitute 15 per cent of its customers. What airlines consider to be child-friendly meals varies considerably. Some carriers such as Qantas go as far as providing nut-free meals for children. And the Far Eastern carriers Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and Japan Airlines provide different meals for different age groups. Cathay, for instance, has menus for children of 1-10 months, 11-24 months and 2-12 years. Meanwhile, KLM said its child meal consists of a 'sandwich and a drink'. Charter airline Air 2000 charges \u00a35 on shorthaul and \u00a310 on longhaul for its meals, which typically consist of sausage and mash, and does not serve children first. Baby food and milk are not available either. The range reflects a growing difference between what airlines offer parents travelling with children, with facilities varying as much as the contents of the children's activity pack. Few airlines offer everything. While British Airways provides sky cots for babies under six months as well as bulkhead infant seats for the under-twos, unlike most airlines, it refuses to guarantee them until check-in. And although United Airlines doesn't board families first, it does allow infants under two a full 32kg baggage allowance in the hold rather than the more standard 10kg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
