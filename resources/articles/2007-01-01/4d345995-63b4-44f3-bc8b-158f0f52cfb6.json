It was all of a piece with his starting at primary school this term and casting himself as more \"grown up\", though in truth I suspect it was the thought of seeing said creature's terrible teeth and terrible claws up close. So we were on the lookout for another show. Praise be then for the wonderful Shoe Baby puppet show, which begins, \"There once was a baby who hid in a shoe and had learnt how to say, 'How do you do?'\" I've sat through some tediously twee puppet shows before but this one bounced along for a perfectly paced half an hour or so - there were no toilet breaks to contend with or running and screaming in the aisles. The music, by Tom Gray of Gomez, was absolutely fantastic and the sets and puppeteering spot on. We loved the colourful octopus and its umbrella body, and the stop-start journey of the baby on the way to the zoo had everyone laughing. There were a few alarmed faces at the front when a pair of giants briefly broke through the fourth wall, but all was assuaged when the puppeteers revealed themselves after the show and sat with their puppets on their lap and talked to the children about how they worked them. That's the way to do it! Chris Hall #183; Shoe Baby is on tour now, see www.longnosepuppets.com. Shoe Baby by Joyce Dunbar, Walker Books, \u00a35.99 Celebrate Russian New Year London has just about recovered from one New Year's Eve when along comes another, although today's Russian Winter Festival in Trafalgar Square, marking the traditional end to the Russian year, is likely to be a less raucous and more family-friendly affair than the capital's usual shenanigans on December 31. There are Russian children's games and puppet shows as well as food including borscht, blinis and beef stroganoff and Baltika beer for the grown-ups. The stage entertainment starts traditionally enough with balalaikas and accordions and Cossack dancing, although at about 4pm they will be cranking it up a bit with sets by Russia's \"female Rolling Stones\", Ranetki Girls, the rock band Nogu Svelo and DJs. Other celebrations around the UK include a family evening of classic Russian ballet music and storytelling tomorrow at St George's in Bristol (6pm, adults \u00a39, under 18s \u00a35, 0845 4024001; www.stgeorgesbristol.co.uk). But it's not the venue's last new year event - next month they are staging workshops and a family concert to welcome the Chinese New Year of the Pig on Sunday February 25. Nikki Spencer #183; The Russian Winter Festival takes place in Trafalgar Square, London from 11am to 6.30pm (020-7983 4100, london.gov.uk. Entry is free. Give a toy a funeral I get killed four to five times a day, on average. This is not a problem, as my slayer usually magically resurrects me on the condition that I confirm that I was killed fairly. Why are three- to five-year-old kids so fascinated with death? Freud amusingly suggested in his theory of instincts that at this age children begin to have a death wish. Various religions also have their ideas on what this is all about. To me, it is more likely that kids find death confusing. How can people suddenly cease to exist? Anything that is mystifying is, of course, stunningly interesting. We once lasted an hour-long car journey without anyone screaming in boredom - all because we were conducting a Q&amp;A session on death rituals for a rapt audience of two preschoolers. But my son got the shock of his life when he really \"killed\" one of his toys. Between racking sobs I was implored to put Captain Bligh back together. The cannonball had hit it square on the head. There was no way that this toy was going to be the same again. Disaster was quickly averted by Mum's quick thinking: \"Perhaps we could do a pirate's funeral?\" For some reason, the idea of a funeral hit the jackpot. Particularly when there was chocolate on offer at the wake. Captain Bligh's life and untimely death were mourned in style and then promptly forgotten. I was being slain again within 24 hours. From my son's perspective, everything was back to normal. Dead people were being resurrected and life could continue as planned. Vincent Reid Eat out at home Taking children to restaurants can sometimes be a trial. To prepare children for a special meal out or just for some fun, set up a restaurant at home. Ask the children to decide on a theme or type of food: Italian or Chinese work quite well. Younger ones can help make decorations for the table, napkins and coloured flags. Older children can write the menu or if you have a small chalkboard do a \"specials list\". On our Chinese-themed night we bought prawn crackers and sesame toast from the local takeaway and made a child-friendly stir fry (strips of chicken and veg, noodles and soy sauce). The table was laid with chopsticks, paper mats and rice bowls, and to my surprise everyone tucked in. Role-playing different parts can add to the fun, with the children being the waiters and Dad pretending to be the chef!
