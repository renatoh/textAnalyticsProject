He says Australian treasurers need to be good at three things. They need to make good decisions, then have the skills to communicate them, and have the gumption and the policy drive to get smacked down periodically by the prime minister of the day. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that Morrison is good at any of those things yet,\u201d Eslake tells Guardian Australia. The independent economist, who has worked in the Treasury, the financial markets, thinktanks and in government advisory roles, says he was prepared to cut Morrison some slack early in his tenure. He says Morrison was the first treasurer to be dropped into the position with no prior experience in an economic portfolio since Labor\u2019s John Kerin, who replaced Paul Keating as treasurer in 1991, during Labor\u2019s Hawke/Keating power struggle. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough portfolio. Morrison was dropped into the job with no prior experience,\u201d Eslake says. \u201cI believe it showed.\u201d Morrison, 49 next Saturday came into parliament as MP for Cook in New South Wales after a career mixing business, politics (as state director of the Liberal party in NSW) and government agencies (he was MD of Tourism Australia). He came to the treasury portfolio in September 2015 via social services, after a long stint in the immigration portfolio, a period he used to burnish his credentials with Coalition conservatives. Eslake points out the immigration stint was characterised by crude soundbite communications, and a systemic lack of transparency. It\u2019s not a style that works in the treasury portfolio. Eslake says since taking up the treasurer position, Morrison \u201creadily resorts to slogans, and hasn\u2019t shown a capacity to carry a sophisticated or nuanced argument\u201d. In terms of the critical relationship between the treasurer and the prime minister, he says Morrison is not so much sat on by the prime minister, as airily \u201cbrushed aside\u201d by a boss who doesn\u2019t seem to rate him. Eslake says Morrison has \u201cstruggled to develop a coherent narrative\u201d. John Daley, who runs the Grattan Institute, sees a treasurer mired by the Treasury process. \u201cHe seems to be captive to the same forces that have held the last two treasurers captive,\u201d he says. Treasury produces four-year forecasts suggesting the budget will make an orderly transition back to surplus \u2013 a surplus that never arrives. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen nothing from Morrison indicating he\u2019ll do something different. When you are predicting you are going to be in surplus in four years time, why would you have the tougher discussion?\u201d Chris Richardson, who like Eslake started in Treasury, before building up a career as a private forecaster at Access Economics, now owned by Deloitte, is broadly on the same page as Eslake about Morrison\u2019s communication deficiencies, but is more inclined to see a glass half full. He sees a treasurer with a point of view, facing a lot of challenges. \u201cMorrison is clearly a treasurer with strong values, and he seeks policy solutions to try and meet those values,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cBut in a deeply divided Australia, either people aren\u2019t listening, or the communications skills aren\u2019t up to it.\u201d Morrison will preside over his second budget next Tuesday. The Treasury is the second toughest job in Australian politics. Treasurers are responsible for not only government finances, they are held responsible for the performance of the economy. Morrison is trying to manage his two imperatives in complex times, and given most of the job is about saying no to colleagues, treasurers are rarely popular. To impress in his job, Morrison has to have the policy grunt and sufficient command of his material to placate expert external constituencies \u2013 professional economists like Eslake, Daley and Richardson \u2013 who translate developments in economic policy to the Australian public through their regular media appearances and punditry. Then there\u2019s placating the fickle ratings agencies, hovering with intent about Australia\u2019s AAA credit rating, and reassuring the financial markets. Governments also have to also manage the rent seekers, the conga line of lobby groups that descend annually on the national capital to pontificate on the contents of the government\u2019s annual economic statement. Behind the fog of special interests, stand the voters, sometimes barely visible. Morrison has a Herculean task trying to repair the damage the government inflicted on itself with its first, politically toxic budget in 2014 \u2013 the budget that rapid set negative public perceptions about the Coalition government. He has to slay the zombies of the Abbott period, literally in terms of nixing unpopular savings measures the government has no hope of legislating, and metaphorically in the sense of out-running a ghoul \u2013 a ghost of a disastrous government past. The government has to break the negative impressions created by the disastrous opening in 2o14. The government\u2019s persistently poor poll performance in 2017 tells us the imperative of political reinvention is urgent. But the government as a collective has also learned turning the ship of state isn\u2019t easy, particularly in an atmosphere of rolling internal insurgency. Morrison is clearly trying to execute a pivot. He\u2019s attempting to turn the conversation about debt and deficit away from the hysterical \u201cdisaster\u201d rhetoric of Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey. He\u2019s trialling a more constructive characterisation: productive debt, which funds infrastructure and unproductive debt, which funds excessive recurrent spending. Landing the budget\u2019s infrastructure package is a critical component of project reinvention. The implacable austerity of the Abbott period has to make way for prudent nation building. Morrison has to find the dexterity to reposition, without reducing a complex policy argument to facile pantomime. For the treasurer, this will be a significant test. With only limited room to move in a fiscal sense, Morrison also has to send some positive messages on health and education \u2013 issues voters connect with and care about \u2013 and given he\u2019s raised expectations, produce some measures on housing affordability, which is a major political preoccupation in Sydney and Melbourne. Budgets are as much about political storytelling as they are about accounting. Next Tuesday night, Morrison has to make a politically productive break from past mistakes, and land a document that feels internally coherent and makes sense. And while the government\u2019s external constituencies will be rating the budget for clarity, consistency and courage \u2013 their various feelpinions thundering across the airwaves as soon as the 7.30pm embargo lifts \u2013 Morrison\u2019s most existential and pressing challenges are internal. Morrison has gone in a short period of time from being next cab off the rank, the Liberal party\u2019s next natural leader, once the Turnbull cycle inevitably exhausted itself, to watching his stocks plummet. He\u2019s lost ground internally, muddied up in the government\u2019s protracted war of the tribes: the small \u201cl\u201d liberals and libertarians versus the conservatives \u2013 Team Malcolm versus Team Tony. In recent times, the treasurer has had to wear the ignominy of being publicly dropped by the Sydney radio host Ray Hadley. Politicians can often learn the hard way that their media friends and boosters \u2013 people they have spent years courting and flattering and indulging \u2013 are fickle, and temperamental. But Hadley\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t a quixotic shock jock outburst. Declaring himself post-Morrison was a brutal judgment call, a reading of the internal tea leaves. The gesture says Morrison is not currently the red meat conservative\u2019s leadership alternative of choice. Immigration minister Peter Dutton has leap-frogged Morrison, and Tony Abbott (re-embraced by Hadley) remains relentlessly in public view. Morrison is not friendless, he has a group of loyal supporters, but he\u2019s a man without a tribe in the middle of the Coalition\u2019s clash of clans. One colleague is caustic in his assessment. \u201cHe\u2019s the nowhere man.\u201d Around the government, you will hear consistent critiques about Morrison. He\u2019s got a bit of a short fuse. He can rub people the wrong way. He can be brittle. He lacks the capacity to tell a compelling economic story \u2013 he can\u2019t stitch big themes together \u2013 and he lacks finesse managing expectations, which is an essential art form for treasurers, and half the battle in landing a budget successfully. There is also concern around the government that Morrison has fumbled the politically sensitive housing issue prior to the budget, raising expectations that the government can\u2019t possibly meet, and effectively giving the federal government ownership of a problem that could have been sheeted home to the states. Some colleagues who have offered the treasurer policy suggestions designed to raise the government\u2019s level of ambition have been warned off by Morrison declaring the ideas won\u2019t meet the Daily Telegraph test \u2013 an arbitrary benchmark that doesn\u2019t thrill everyone. One colleague who has time for Morrison points out the treasurer has been prepared to push the envelope \u2013 to take on big challenges, and try and hold the line when things get tough \u2013 but remarks the strength can also be a weakness. Sometimes, he won\u2019t take a hint that\u2019s he overextended. Sometimes, he won\u2019t take advice when he needs to. Conservatives have particular complaints about Morrison. There are two perceived transgressions. There\u2019s a belief he walked both sides of the street during Turnbull\u2019s surgical strike against Abbott \u2013 that he didn\u2019t rally his supporters to shore up Abbott against the Turnbull incursion. Some colleagues also see him as being insufficiently committed to a robust savings agenda, which is an article of faith for fiscal conservatives. In the eyes of some internal critics, Morrison in the Treasury has been too inclined to look at revenue options: adjusting super concessions for high income earners, a foray that still reverberates internally. \u201cTreasury has the revenue lever, so they focus on that, and Scott has allowed that to continue. He\u2019s been focused on one side of the equation \u2013 that\u2019s how the base sees it,\u201d says one colleague. \u201cIt\u2019s cost him support.\u201d Other colleagues point out some of the current internal criticism of Morrison might reflect a combination of personal ambition, judicious score settling, and bed wetting. One puts it this way. \u201cThere are many people who might fancy his portfolio, but do we think anyone would find the job easy? All treasurers struggle for the first couple of years. Does anyone really think there is someone out there now, hovering in the wings, who will do a better job?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
