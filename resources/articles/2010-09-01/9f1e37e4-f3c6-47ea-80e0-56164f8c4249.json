Exeter are no different. Talk to anyone there and they will tell you about work ethic and spirit. \"The players' commitment, drive and passion is phenomenal,\" said Ali Hepher, Exeter's assistant coach, after the Premiership new boys' latest win. \"It's a different level. They do it week in, week out. Yes we weren't precise enough today but at least we've got a group of guys who can take this club forward.\" The thing with this Exeter side, though, is that they really must have something a bit different. Rarely, if ever, can a club have come up to the top flight with essentially the same squad that won them promotion and started their Premiership lives with such aplomb. It would be one thing, though, if they were earning their wins purely by scrapping and spoiling as all good toilers do, but there is a stamp of class about their early-season form that begs the question: where have these players been all their rugby lives? Take James Hanks, a second-row forward in his mid-twenties who has excelled in all three of Exeter's matches so far \u2013 rock solid in the lineout and with almighty appetite, as well as aptitude, for ball-carrying. It turns out that the Chiefs discovered him while he was at the local university and he has played more than a hundred times for them. \"We make sure we all work hard for each other,\" Hanks said, with a certain inevitability. \"We're an honest team. We make sure everyone does their job and does as well as they can. No one's out there for themselves; everyone's working for each other.\" Then there is the blindside flanker Tom Johnson, from Coventry, who is similarly relentless. He scored Exeter's only try yesterday. There are more players of whom we have heard, but who struggled to make a breakthrough at more established clubs. They are now flourishing, having been given a chance in so empowering an environment. Other clubs need to start stoking their own boilers, because somebody is going to have to go down. Newcastle have to be alert. They out-scored Exeter, somehow, by two tries to one, Charlie Amesbury and Rob Vickerman finishing neat scores that spoke of a more clinical edge and possibly even a higher class. But they were well beaten in every other department. If Exeter had played as well as in their first two games, they would have won easily. As it was, they won without playing well. That is what the likes of Leicester are supposed to do. They work hard as well, of course, but there seems to be a special quality to the toil going on down Exeter way.
