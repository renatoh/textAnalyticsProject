Heather Knight, the captain, says her side are raring to go and are keen to play a part in English cricket\u2019s big summer, as the men\u2019s team seek to emulate Knight &amp; co\u2019s achievement two summers ago and win a World Cup on home soil. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a very exciting summer \u2013 for us and for the game in general,\u201d Knight said. \u201cWe\u2019re desperate to try and be successful, and play a part in that. It\u2019s hard not to have one eye on the Ashes and look ahead \u2013 that\u2019s always such a massive event in our calendar \u2013but we\u2019ve got to make sure we remain focused and start the summer well.\u201d Her side are starting out with a near-full complement of players, with Sophie Ecclestone and Jenny Gunn back in the squad having missed the recent tour to Sri Lanka. The wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor also returns having sat out much of the domestic season with a hip injury. That contrasts with the situation faced by West Indies, who will be without the mighty muscle of the all-rounder Deandra Dottin, missing having recently undergone shoulder surgery. Dottin played a crucial role in her side\u2019s shock four-wicket win against England in the group stage of last year\u2019s World Twenty20 \u2013 the last time the two sides faced each other. On recent form this England side should have no difficulties. They go into the match on a 10-game winning streak achieved in the subcontinent over the winter. More importantly, there are crucial ICC Women\u2019s Championship points at stake: England need two more wins to achieve their goal of automatic qualification for the 2021 World Cup, while a clean sweep would mean they overtake the leaders, Australia. However West Indies \u2013 currently placed seventh in the Championship \u2013 will be keen to steal some points for themselves. The visitors are fresh from whitewashing Ireland 3-0 in a T20 series, with the opener, Hayley Matthews, in fine form, having hit an unbeaten century in the most recent of those encounters. \u201cThey\u2019re a team we know very well,\u201d Knight said. \u201cI\u2019ve played with Hayley at the Hobart Hurricanes and I\u2019ve also played with [the captain] Stafanie Taylor at Western Storm. I\u2019ve got to know how they work, identified potential weaknesses, but I guess the same works for those two in terms of my game. \u201c West Indies will be a big test so we\u2019ll need to be at our best, but we\u2019re confident about what we can bring to the table.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
