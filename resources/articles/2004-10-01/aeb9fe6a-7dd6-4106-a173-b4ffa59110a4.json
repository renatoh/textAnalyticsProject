Paul Stretford, 46, who runs the Proactive agency, says he was blackmailed by three men, boxing promoter John Hyland and brothers Anthony and Christopher Bacon, after Rooney signed to his agency. All three deny the charge of blackmail. The men are accused of acting in a threatening manner during a meeting at a Cheshire hotel in June 2003, which was secretly filmed by Mr Stretford. Mr Hyland, who worked with the player's original agent, was reluctant to give up control of the player and wanted 50% of the agent's earnings for Rooney for the next decade. Mr Stretford told Warrington crown court he had offered to buy out their interest in Rooney for \u00a35,000, but this had been rejected. The men met several times over a seven-month period to try to negotiate a settlement. The agent, who represents 270 of the world's top footballers, said that at a meeting in December 2002 he offered to give 50% of his net profits on Rooney for three years but Mr Hyland refused. Mr Stretford said: \"John [Hyland] went ballistic. He was very annoyed and angry.\" Asked by the prosecution barrister, John Hedgecoe, how the disagreement had affected his health, Mr Stretford broke down in tears and asked for a moment to compose himself. He said he had developed arthritis in his foot caused by stress. He was also found to have a heart defect. \"Physically and emotionally I was not in a great position,\" he said. \"It was just another layer of problems and another layer of stress and anxiety to deal with.\" Earlier Mr Hyland's barrister, Lord Carlile, said Mr Stretford had regarded Rooney, who recently transferred to Manchester United for \u00a327m, as a cash cow and was \"desperate\" to represent him. Mr Stretford was paid \u00a31.5m from Manchester United for the transfer, Lord Carlile said. He told Judge David Hale: \"It is the defence assertion that Mr Stretford was desperate to get Wayne Rooney as his client because he knew he could milk the cow from both ends. If a solicitor was doing that, he would be struck off without a moment's hesitation. \"There is an issue in this case about Paul Stretford's many interests in Wayne Rooney and the ruthless way in which he approached those interests.\" The footballer's father told the court that in summer 2002, six months before his contract with his first agent was to expire, he had been to see the Liverpool-based solicitor Kevin Dooley for advice about changing his son's agent. Wayne Rooney senior was asked by Lord Carlile if he was aware that Mr Dooley, who has since died, was at the time under investigation for defrauding clients out of thousands of pounds and was later struck off. Mr Rooney said he had not known this. The prosecutor, Mr Hedgecoe, said the three defendants were \"clearly involved in a very intimidating episode of blackmail in a case where the stakes were potentially enormous\". The trial, expected to last at least two weeks, continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
