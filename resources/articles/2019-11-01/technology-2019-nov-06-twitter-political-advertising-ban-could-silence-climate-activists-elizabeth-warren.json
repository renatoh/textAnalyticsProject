The announcement by Twitter was generally well received by critics of the state of online political advertising. The company\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, had taken a sideswipe at Facebook, tweeting: \u201cIt\u2019s not credible for us to say \u2018we\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, but if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad \u2026 well \u2026 they can say whatever they want\u2019.\u201d But a follow-up from Twitter\u2019s general counsel, Vijaya Gadde, revealed that the company was considering extending the ban beyond political advertising to \u201cissue ads\u201d. Gadde said the company was considering outlawing \u201cads that advocate for or against legislative issues of national importance (such as climate change, healthcare, immigration, national security and taxes)\u201d. The mention of climate change stoked concerns that the rules could allow oil companies to promote the benefits of fossil fuels while barring critics from noting the related carbon dioxide emissions and the contribution to the climate crisis. Dorsey responded to Warren\u2019s criticism by saying that the new rules were not yet in place and would not be revealed publicly until 15 November \u2013 10 days after elections in the US and a little under a month before the UK general election. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, backed Warren, saying: \u201c[Her point] is one of the key issues many miss about banning political ads on any platform. You can\u2019t ban these ads without significantly inhibiting the ability of activists, labour groups and organisers to make their cases too.\u201d Since he was promoted last year, Mosseri, who had been Instagram\u2019s vice-president of product, has become one of the public faces of Facebook (Instagram\u2019s owner), actively wading into policy debates on Twitter in a way Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, do not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
