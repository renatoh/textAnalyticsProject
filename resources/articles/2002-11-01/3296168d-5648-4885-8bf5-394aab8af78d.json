The appointment follows frank comments by current chief executive Jean-Ren\u00e9 Fourtou, who admitted recently he did not know much about the film and music industries. Vivendi owns the Universal film and music businesses and its entertainment division - a core part of the group - suffered a revenue slump in the group's third quarter results. Handing the co-chief executive role to Mr Diller, who already runs Vivendi's film, television and cable assets, will keep the US business in safe hands while Mr Fourtou negotiates a massive disposal programme. \"We can confirm the company has set up an informal structure to operate over the next several months,\" said a Vivendi spokeswoman. Mr Fourtou is also putting together a \u00a32.5bn bid to take control of French telecoms group Cegetel amid fierce competition from Vodafone. Vivendi sources said the co-chief executive post would be an interim appointment. \"Interim means he'll be there until Fourtou gets his head around the business,\" said one analyst, who declined to be named. Mr Diller ran Paramount Pictures in the 70s and created Rupert Murdoch's Fox Network in the 80s. He joined Vivendi when the company's former chief executive, Jean-Marie Messier, bought his USA Networks cable group last December. Vivendi owes \u00a312bn and is committed to raising \u00a37.6bn from asset sales over the next 18 months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
