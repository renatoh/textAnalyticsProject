The \u00a35 million campaign will portray drunk behaviour as socially unacceptable and embarrassing, capitalising on disgust at images of incoherent revellers lying in gutters and vomiting in the streets. It follows research suggesting one of the reasons Britain does not have a relaxed, Mediterranean-style 'cafe culture' of drinking is because there is little stigma now attached to being drunk in public. In southern Europe, drunkenness is socially unacceptable, particularly for women - who in Britain appear to be increasingly affected by binge drinking. The move reflects anxiety among ministers at the strength of the backlash against the change. The Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend Nigel McCulloch, joined the attack yesterday warning of a 'real danger' that people would simply drink more because of the longer opening hours. 'If that is the case then that is disastrous and another example of the government not treating alcohol as a serious drug,' he told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. The advertising campaign would be screened around Christmas and New Year to coincide with the introduction of the new liberalised licensing laws. 'We have all seen the pictures of people lying in gutters, stumbling around and falling over. We want to change public attitudes so they know it is not acceptable to go out at the weekend and binge drink like that,' said a source at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The Tories last week called for a U-turn on the licensing laws which would see late opening introduced only as isolated pilot schemes, which could be abandoned if they caused trouble. However the DCMS has ruled that out, arguing that when Scotland tried a similar approach in the 1990s with 'zoning' for late-night drinking, crowds swamped the areas set aside for late opening. No final decision has been taken over whether the new ads should be grimly hard-hitting - as with drink-drive posters - or wittier. However campaigners warned the ads would need to be as imaginative as those promoting alcohol if they were to reach the intended audience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
