Once considered rather undignified in some academic circles, entrepreneurs now abound in colleges and universities across the country in some shape or form, and their number is only set to mushroom if the number of courses being offered is anything to go by. This boom definitely reflects the resurgence seen in the wider economy. The image of entrepreneurs took a bit of a bashing during the nineties, as we all preferred to get in touch with our feminine sides rather than pursue the \"greed is good\" philosophy so in vogue a decade earlier. However, that's all over now and entrepreneurs are back in favour. We've all allegedly learnt the lessons from the dot.com cycle of boom and bust, and Tony Blair has declared that he plans to make the UK the number one place for e-business start-ups in Europe. Young people, attracted by the internet, are starting businesses in record numbers. The only question is: Can you teach someone to become an entrepreneur? Enterprise Conventional wisdom says potential Richard Bransons are born rather than fashioned, and a cursory flick through biographies says most of the great entrepreneurs left school as soon as they could, never mind going to university. That said, the rise of MBAs in this country has been partly fuelled by a desire by graduates to gain the skills that will make them better entrepreneurs. There is obviously a big market for these new courses as most are over-subscribed and competition for places can be intense. The spark According to David Johnson, who runs the MA in entrepreneurship at the Durham Business School, the one thing that binds his students together is that they all have that entrepreneurial spark. \"We've got everyone from farmers to health visitors. Many are already running a small business and want to become better at it. Some have an idea and are looking to learn the skills they think they will need - others work in organisations and simply want to better understand the business world in which they operate.\" He says the principal difference between an MBA and his course is that the latter is less \"prescriptive\". \"We do teach many of the things covered by MBAs - marketing, pricing, how to build an organisation etc, but we tend to go with the group a lot more and focus on the problems and challenges they face. There aren't exams to work towards and the students' assignments are designed to examine real businesses - often their own, sometimes other people's - but always to come up with solutions to real problems.\" His part-time course over 21 months involves a four-and-a-half day induction course at the start followed up by two days a month - usually a Monday and Tuesday. All attendees, he says, have spent some time out in the real world since doing their degree. \"We'll accept applications from recent graduates if they can show some entrepreneurial background, but we might say come back in a few years' time when we feel you would get more out of the course.\" Hungry One woman who is looking for recent graduates is Wendy Rogers. She is course administrator for the one-year, full-time postgrad diploma in entrepreneurship at the University of Glamorgan in Wales - and she has some European Union funding on her side. \"I'm looking for people who are hungry - they don't necessarily have to have a business, but they've got to have that little something that sets them apart from the rest of the pack. Most of our students have done degrees in business studies but we are also interested in people with environmental studies or even psychology.\" She says her course has a strong consulting bias as this is what most of her students end up going into. \"We are heavily involved with lots of local small businesses who come to us with problems and our students come up with the solutions. Typically, they might be asked to come up with a diversification plan or a marketing strategy, and they spend a few days researching the company before going away and working out some answers - they are learning how to help companies develop businesses.\" \"Lots of students don't have a business in mind before they start the course but see an opportunity as it progresses. Several have gone on to start up their own companies and all our ex-students are working.\" Unlike many other similar courses, Wendy says she is not looking for graduates with years of experience, but they should have been out in the \"harsh world\" for at least six months. The course has the added benefit of European Union funding which pays students a \u00a350-a-week bursary. Specialist courses The other big growth area is in specialist postgrad courses with entrepreneurship at their heart. Next September students will be arriving from all over the world at Cambridge University to be the first intake of a new masters course in bioscience enterprise. Believed to be the first of its kind in the UK, it has been created in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and designed to appeal to \"today's biotechnology research students who have an entrepreneurial glint in their eye\". According to the course's assistant director, Claire Cockcroft, around a third of the year will be spent focusing on the life sciences and the rest on business management, bioethics, examining case studies - everything relevant to someone thinking of setting up a biotech venture. \"The course has attracted a huge interest from all over the world. The biotech and life sciences sector is valued at over $400bn in Europe and the US, and the lure of the business world is hard for student scientists to resist.\" She agrees with the others that entrepreneurial spirit is something you're probably born with, but points out that the people starting businesses in specialist areas need specialist skills. She also says its success is likely to lead to a rash of similar ventures at the university and a nanotechnology/enterprise course is already being planned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
