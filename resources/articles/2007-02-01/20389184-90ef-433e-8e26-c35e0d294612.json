We want the Office of Rail Regulation to consider action against Network Rail to shake it out of its complacency. While we accept that the girls should not have crossed while red lights were showing, they clearly believed the warnings were for the train they wished to catch and which had already passed in front of them. Unlocked gates meant that they were able to walk in front of another train travelling at 65mph - for which the sighting time is a mere three seconds. Network Rail performed a U-turn in September 2006 and agreed to install a footbridge and to lock the gates - but the gates are still unlocked, despite an independent Rail Accident Investigation Branch report in December, which put locking the gates ahead of a footbridge in its recommendations. Perhaps the worst failing of Network Rail has been over risk assessment. The April 2005 assessment was described by the RAIB as \"substantially flawed\". Other risk assessments - one as yet unpublished - reveal that a true assessment would place the crossing in the highest risk category. Two weeks ago, on January 29, there was yet another report of a near miss at the station. Network Rail must lock the gates now before another family has to suffer a similar tragedy to ours.
