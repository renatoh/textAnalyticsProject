There was none, he concluded, in the Premier League. Often avuncular, Bruce cut an unforgiving figure as he excoriated his players. \u201cI can\u2019t dress it up any other way,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t defend them.\u201d Sternly, he vowed there would be no repeat. \u201cMake no mistake. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Yet perhaps his most pertinent comment could have seemed a statement of the blindingly obvious. \u201cWe\u2019re Hull City, let\u2019s not forget that,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe\u2019re kidding ourselves if we think we\u2019re better than we are.\u201d For 90 minutes, Hull had an identity crisis. They had prospered as underdogs at the Emirates Stadium and Anfield but Burnley, the ultimate outsiders, usurped them to claim that mantle. \u201cThere was an expectation for us to come here and turn them over,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cBut we were so lacklustre and lifeless it was scary.\u201d He has overseen a glamorous upgrade at the KC Stadium. It prompted the suggestion that defeat was all the more galling because, on paper, he had the best group of players he had assembled during his 16 years in management. His reply was succinct. \u201cNames on paper mean absolutely jack shit when you play like that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have names that produce a performance.\u201d Bruce played with many of the biggest names of his generation in a Manchester United side who possessed battling qualities and technical skills in equal measure. Two decades on, he could call on Abel Hern\u00e1ndez and Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez, both members of Uruguay\u2019s World Cup squad, among his attacking options. His Burnley counterpart, Sean Dyche, fielded Danny Ings and Ashley Barnes, formerly of Dorchester Town and Salisbury City respectively. Supposedly lesser figures had the bigger impact. \u201cI have played in nearly every league possible, right from the bottom,\u201d said Barnes, whose maiden Premier League goal clinched Burnley\u2019s first win at this level since 2010. \u201cSo it\u2019s a dream come true to play in the Premier League and to get off the mark. It\u2019s the first of many, hopefully.\u201d Part of the charm of the Burnley squad lies in tales of such unlikely rises. Four of their starting 11 had graduated from the non-league scene and a fifth, the left-back Stephen Ward, from the League of Ireland. If the thought was that Hull, who secured a surprise promotion to the Premier League and confounded expectations by staying up and strengthening, were the role models for Burnley, the opposite scenario transpired. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting desperately hard to stay in the division but we should know because we were like them 12 months ago,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThe sad indictment was that they had a greater desire to win the game.\u201d And victories have been in short supply for Hull. Five often entertaining and admirable draws have kept them out of trouble this season but they have triumphed only twice, against Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace. Their next three opponents all finished in the top seven last season. \u201cWe\u2019ll be at the bottom of the table playing like that,\u201d Bruce warned. Burnley remain at the foot of the table. They occupy the position most expect them to but they were unconcerned when others suggested they might not win all season. Predictions they will beat a swift return to the Championship serve only to galvanise them. \u201cWe got written off last year at the start of the season, the middle of the season when we were up there and even at the end, people thought we were going to drop away,\u201d said the centre-back and captain Jason Shackell, as defiant off the pitch as he had proved on it. \u201cKeep writing us off and we\u2019ll keep proving you wrong.\u201d Dyche has married an upbeat demeanour with an awareness of the economic realities. If anything, however, he understated the scale of their challenge. \u201cThere are two divisions, if not three, within the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know where ours is. Our market is different to that.\u201d Financially, Burnley are in a league of their own \u2013 or the Championship \u2013 but teamwork, team spirit and organisation cannot be measured on the balance sheet. They have often been hallmarks of Hull. Not on Saturday, though. Man of the match Danny Ings (Burnley)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
