I'm directing the panto written by Stephen Fry at the Old Vic. The script for Cinderella is always different each time it is performed, but this version is quite traditional. We have Sandi Toksvig flying around the stage and some hilarious ugly sisters. Stephen Fry's personality comes across as it's very witty. Some of the jokes are high brow but some involve throwing custard pies. It's just very good fun. In today's rehearsal, I saw the pantomime cow for the first time and it's the most beautiful I've ever seen, with big long eyelashes. Where would you rather be? Anglesey. I went there in October just before the rehearsals started. I'd not been since I was eight and it really has the best beaches I've ever seen. What's so special about it? In the south west corner there are long beautiful stretches with no seaweed, the sea is so blue and the sand is golden. The people are very friendly too. What would you do there? Go for long walks, eat lovely food. Stephen Fry has this fantastic word: \"chillax\". I'd chillax. Where would you stay? At Neuadd Lwyd. It's a five-star country guest house in a Victorian rectory with just four rooms that have great big comfy beds, baths on legs and views across Snowdon. The couple who run it are so nice. Susannah, the wife, is the chef and trained at the Ballymaloe cookery school in Ireland. Who would you take with you? My husband Mark. He's an actor. In fact, he's playing one of the ugly sisters. I've not seen him in his costume yet. He has been wearing a skirt for rehearsals but I didn't let him take it to Anglesey. What's the one place you'd like to see before you die? I don't think I will ever get to see it, but I'd like to go to Afghanistan. In the film Osama there were so many shots of it and it looked like a beautiful and fascinating country. I hope I get to go, but I'll have to wait until it gets a bit safer. \u00b7 Cinderella is at the Old Vic, London SE1 (0870 060 6628, oldvictheatre.com), Dec 4-Jan 20."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
