When one thinks of my good friend Gordon Brown's approach to everything from better public service to joining the euro, it becomes obvious that the Brownian remedy has come straight from Doctor Stevenson's prescription - and, my goodness, how the Chancellor has applied himself to the labour! Stevenson died not only before New Labour was invented, but even before Old Labour came on the scene. He is not to be confused with George Stephenson, who died two years before Stevenson was born and whose famous steam locomotive, the Rocket, attained a speed of 36 miles an hour on the Manchester-Liverpool railway in 1830. As many a hapless commuter knows, 36 miles an hour is a speed to which some privatised trains aspire. These thoughts came to mind last Sunday when we parked outside London Bridge station and tried to take the 10:57 to Sevenoaks. Having been directed to platform two, we heard on the loudspeaker that the Connex South East train would now depart from platform three. Ten minutes later, the loudspeaker on platform three apologised to those passengers waiting for the Sevenoaks train on platform three, because it had just departed from platform two. The event brought out the spirit of the Blitz on platform three. A schoolgirl from Sevenoaks and a woman from Los Angeles overheard me say 'Lucky we've got the car' and hitched a lift. We all had an enjoyable journey, and, by the way, we agreed that if there had indeed been a Sevenoaks train departing from platform two, we hadn't seen it, and it might well have been a train of mass deception, travelling hopefully at 0 miles in the hour. As a central Londoner, I do not suffer the pains of commuting, but I have heard the stories. En passant, Connex has since been sacked and will be replaced by a state-run operator. The incident is just one of many reminders about the gulf between this Government's belief that its economic policies are wonderful and the reality that this is a coun try where it's a pleasant surprise when things actually work, and travelling hopefully rather than arriving has been made into a national sport. Now this is not another bleat about New Labour - or at least not just about New Labour. The deterioration in our transport and other public services anticipated the 1997 election by several decades. And it was obvious, however much people might go on about the need for reform and the dangers of 'throwing money' at problems, that if you don't throw money, things only get worse, and if you allow them to get worse before you throw money at them it will take even longer to bring services up to European standards. New Labour almost certainly made a huge strategic mistake in taking so long to do something about the public services and in accepting the Thatcher-Lawson-Major settlement when it came to taxation and the supposed wonders of privatisation. In the short run, this reaped the Government huge political dividends but it did the country a disservice. In the longer run, the political dividend may run out and the disservice to the country could become even greater if, despite its huge majority, this Government is eventually removed by a disillusioned elec torate and we end up with an even more right-wing Conservative administration. Which brings us to the recent row that erupted in the Labour Party over taxation - potentially one of the most important signposts of this Parliament, for all that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor moved swiftly to humiliate the perpetrator of the 'gaffe', Peter Hain. I have been surprised by the number of people who believe that Hain was 'put up to it' (by Tony Blair) when he speculated publicly about increasing the top rate of tax, only to retract the same day. Certainly Hain seems to have had a licence to think aloud, but in this case he thought a little too loudly. Cynicism about the Blair Government knows few bounds these days, yet it is stretching things to believe it would orchestrate a farce in which, first, Hain leaks his speech to the press, then Alastair Campbell telephones him and orders him to go on the Today programme and recant and then the Prime Minister rules out all thought of an increase in the top rate of tax - which becomes the main story in the British press to emerge from an important European Union summit in Thessaloniki. No, I believe that Hain put himself up to it, simultaneously putting a marker down for future leadership stakes. He also managed to produce a further refinement on the New Labour art of spin. Old hands object to the way newspapers now routinely predict that, for example: 'Peter Hain, will tonight say in his Aneurin Bevan lecture: \"How can we ensure that hardworking middle-income families and the low paid get a better deal, except by those at the very top of the pay scale contributing more?\" ' The Hain refinement is: don't say it. Because of the row, Hain was forced to say the opposite: 'We will not raise the top rate of tax.' The significance is huge. Not only did Hain tread on the Chancellor's territory: he also lit a fuse under Gordon Brown's entire strategy. First he drew attention to the Chancellor's favourite stealth tax. This used to be the 'fuel escalator', under which the duty on petrol and other fuels was routinely raised every year by several percentage points above the rate of inflation. That one was rumbled during the great - and entirely unexpected - fuel price revolt of late summer 2000. Then the Chancellor discovered 'fiscal drag', a phenomenon that has been with us for donkey's years, but which the public was slow to rumble. Thus the recent Budget Report has a line about the 'indexation of starting and basic rate limits'. This means raising the threshold of earnings at which people pay tax in line with inflation, but not in line with average earnings. This practice in itself drags more and more people into the tax net. In fact, sometimes he does not index thresholds at all, as happened this year (and has happened before) with the top rate, when he quietly decided not even to compensate for price inflation. Since Labour returned to office in 1997 the number of people paying the top rate of tax has risen from 2.1 million to 3.3 million. The Institute of Fiscal studies estimates that to remove 1.2 million from the top rate bracket would cost \u00a33.4 billion and that this could be financed by applying a new top rate of 50 per cent to those earning over \u00a3100,000 a year. The Chancellor is furious not just because Hain has drawn attention to this area. He has done so at a time when Brown's entire fiscal strategy for the medium and long term has come under increasing scrutiny. It is an open question whether a lot more money will be needed for the public services. Labour, having been pusillanimous about tax for years, has been embarrassed by the fuss made about a mere 1p on national insurance. The issue of financing tax relief for the middle classes, over and above the problem of financing the public services, is the last thing Brown wanted to face. While we are on the subject, this gives me the chance, on behalf of my old friend Denis Healey, to try to stop people misquoting him. He never said that he would tax the rich 'until the pips squeak', but he does recall quoting the phrase and attributing it to 'Lloyd George or Balfour'. 'What I said, which was absolutely true,' he explained patiently, 'was that there would be howls of anguish from those who are rich enough to pay the highest rate of income tax - but you never hear a word of sympathy from them for those who are too poor to pay tax at all.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
