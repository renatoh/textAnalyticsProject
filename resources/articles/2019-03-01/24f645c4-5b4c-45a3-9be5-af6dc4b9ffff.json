He has since won 11 caps for Scotland and succeeded Finn Russell as Glasgow\u2019s fly-half so seamlessly that the 22-year-old will on Saturday spearhead the Pro14\u2019s side\u2019s attempt to make the semi\u2011finals of the European Cup for the first time. Standing in their way are Saracens, the 2016 and 2017 winners and current English champions, whose last defeat at Allianz Park was against Leicester in February last year. They defeated Glasgow twice in the pool stage, but not effortlessly, prevailing 13-3 in a feisty match in Glasgow before pulling away in the return match after conceding three tries in the first half. The battle of Hastings and Owen Farrell at fly-half will be one of the intriguing subplots in a contest between a club that have established themselves as a leading force in Europe and one that are the leaders of their league conference and are looking to make an impact in a tournament that has yet to produce a Scottish finalist. \u201cSaracens away is probably the ultimate test in Europe,\u201d says Hastings, the son of the former Scotland captain Gavin and who came off the bench during their comeback in the Calcutta Cup match at Twickenham two Saturdays ago. \u201cThey have won the tournament before and are always in the knockout stages. It is a big test for us, but we have faced them twice this season and seen how they play their game. \u201cWe think we have players who can manipulate them. We have shown that we can take them apart and score tries, but we have to put it together in defence and attack for 80 minutes. We had good periods in both the other games against them, but on Saturday we will need a full performance. I am looking forward to facing Owen Farrell, a good player who has had a brilliant career. He will be bossing his forwards and trying to put them in the right areas and I will be as well.\u201d Glasgow were at Saracens in the quarter-final two years ago and conceded 38 points. Scotland drew with England 38-38 having been trailing 31-0 towards the end of the first half and Hastings believes that resurrection will benefit Glasgow this time. \u201cA number of the Glasgow team were involved in that match and we can take massive positivity from it. We can be really confident when we play Saracens and while we know it will be physical because the other two matches were, we have some big, aggressive boys and there will be no holding back. \u201cThere are a few teams like Saracens in the Pro14, so it is not something we are unused to. We also play on an artificial pitch, a surface that favours a fast game and suits our brand.\u201d Hastings has tasted success against Saracens: he was on Bath\u2019s bench during the 14-11 Premiership win at the end of 2016, one of 12 appearances he made for the West Country club in three years having joined their academy. \u201cI was young and coming through the system. I did not have a clue about playing games and went through [training] shapes because that was what the coaches told me to do. It was good to be there as an outside-half because I was behind George Ford and Rhys Priestland, international players who were brilliant to me, always very approachable and helping out. Being there definitely helped my career. \u201cI wanted to go back to Scotland. I was enjoying Bath but not playing much and felt I would have more of a chance at Glasgow. In my first year I was behind Finn [now with Racing 92 in France] and Peter Horne, but at the start of this season I managed to string a few games together and played pretty consistently. I think I made the right move. I have never felt any pressure to be Finn and have been able to focus on me.\u201d If Hastings does not have Russell\u2019s sense of the outrageousness, he showed during Glasgow\u2019s victory in this season\u2019s opening round at Cardiff Blues that he is prepared to attack from anywhere on the field if he scents opportunity, mixing running and passing with precise kicking. He was the man of the match that afternoon, cleverly varying his game, but Allianz Park will provide the sternest test in his developing career."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
