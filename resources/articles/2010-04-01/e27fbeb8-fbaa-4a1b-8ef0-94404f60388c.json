Regrettably he chose not to accept that offer.\" And so it is war in suburban south London. \"Voting for Andrew will simply split the anti-Labour vote,\" warns Cameron, whose local followers had already raised the tone by issuing a seven-page briefing referring to Pelling's acknowledged past difficulty with depression. For truth will out in the new politics. Nothing will be forgotten. Be warned. \u2022 And there's a tough decision to make in Buckingham, where Speaker John Bercow faces the indignity of having to fight to keep his seat. A bare-knuckle fight there, too, with combatants Ukip, a host of independents, and a grizzly from the BNP. So tight in fact that both the Speaker and John Stevens, the former Tory MEP who would unseat him, are locked in a strange and unseemly struggle for the endorsement of that cheeky chappie, man of the people, Charles Kennedy. Stevens, once a Lib Dem, claims to have won the backing of the former Lib Dem leader during a meeting the pair had at the House of Commons on 17 March. Bercow counters with a colourful leaflet picture of Charles Kennedy and a quote from him. \"At a time when the reputation of parliament is at a low ebb, John Bercow has taken on the job of Speaker and pushed ahead with overdue reform,\" it says. \"He has shown that he can work with people of all parties and none to achieve greater openness and to make sure MPs serve the people who elect them.\" If only Charlie carried as much weight with the Lib Dems. \u2022 Why oh \"why can't Dave and Gordon learn a few lessons from Britain's most gloriously un-PC supermayor\", asked the Daily Mail last August? \"The counter-revolution has begun,\" said the Telegraph.\"What's not to like?\" \"He's Don us proud,\" was the verdict from JeremyClarkson in the Sun. And what, having looked closely at the mess that is municipal government in Doncaster, does the Audit Commission now say of the authority and our friend, the rightwing English Democrat mayor Peter Davies. \"Those leading the council \u2013 the mayor and cabinet, some councillors and some officers \u2013 do not collectively have the capacity or capability to make the necessary improvements in governance,\" is one of the watchdog's conclusion. \"The mayor does not always act in a way which demonstrates an understanding of the need for an elected mayor to lead his authority and represent all the people in Doncaster.\" There's another. Oh dear! \u2022 Disappointment on stilts for the mouthy rocker Joan Jett, who was an honoured guest at New York's Dressed to Kilt show, staged by Sean Connery's Friends of Scotland group. Jett arrived confident of seeing kilts worn with traditional abandon. It didn't happen. \"I didn't see anything. I heard all these amazing rumours about balls flying,\" she told New York magazine. \"It was all I could talk about all day. That was what everybody was telling me. I came for the balls!\". Poor Joan (pictured). Hopes dashed. Illusions shattered. \u2022 And finally, to whomever placed that poster calling for William Hague's re-election in north Yorkshire next to the colourful sign that cautions \"Beware of the bull\". Naughty step please. You know where it is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
