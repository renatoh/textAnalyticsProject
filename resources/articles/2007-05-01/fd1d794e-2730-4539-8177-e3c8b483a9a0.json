How about the possibly more boring but essential task of electing councillors to serve in a local-government system often bedevilled by national party politics, with whose aura you, among others, constantly surround local-government elections? Richard Wilson Beverley, East Yorkshire Polly Toynbee seems to suggest that Labour is good and everyone else is bad (If Blair didn't deliver, what good will voting Tory do? May 1). Liberal Democrats, as the largest group in a coalition with Conservatives and Independents, took over from Labour in Redcar in 2003. We inherited a rotten borough from a terrible Labour administration that was anything but progressive. Under our leadership we became the first council in the Labour-dominated north-east to introduce equal pay; we saved \u00a317.5m in efficiency gains and invested \u00a318.5m in the elderly, young people and the environment. We are now a beacon council for recycling, the best in the north-east and the second most improved in the country. We are probably the best example of a progressive council that now exists. Cllr Chris Abbott Leader, Lib Dem Group, Redcar &amp; Cleveland borough council Polly Toynbee writes as if there were only three parties to vote for on Thursday, and only one with any left-of-centre credentials. She forgets the Green party, which in last year's local elections increased its number of councillors by 28% to a total of 93. The people of Kirklees, Norwich, Lancaster, Oxford and Brighton have benefited hugely from having significant Green representation on councils, promoting innovative policies aimed at marrying environmental sustainability and social justice. Far from betraying the left by not voting Labour, a vote for the Greens is a vote for precisely the principles Toynbee is advocating. Andrew Dobson North Staffordshire Green party Polly Toynbee said that the prime minister is being \"booed off the stage in a hiss of hatred\". She then gleefully quotes polling figures on \"trust\" that she takes from the Daily Telegraph. She is a little premature. A poll in the Independent, published on the same day as Polly's article, finds that 89% of Labour supporters, and 61% of the population as a whole, believe that Tony Blair has been a good prime minister. A little balance is all I ask. David Hill Director of communications, 10 Downing Street It is rich of Polly Toynbee to refer to \"promiscuous Lib Dems keeping Tories in power\", and the \"Lib Dem failure to align themselves firmly against the right\", after a decade in which Labour has adopted one rightwing or authoritarian policy after another: selectivity in schools, widening the gap between rich and poor, illiberal legislation at home and gunboat diplomacy abroad. If she wants social democracy she should join the Lib Dems. Denis Mollison Musselburgh, East Lothian Chris Huhne tries to claim the green high ground over the Conservatives (Blue won't be green, April 27). He could do with applying the same green-tinged magnifying glass to his own party. In Newcastle upon Tyne the ruling Lib Dem council nodded through the second Tyne road tunnel - a \u00a3185m road-building project opposed by a broad coalition of green NGOs (including Friends of the Earth) and local residents. Brian Paget South Shields, Tyne and Wear Chris Huhne rightly points to the Tories on the London Assembly opposing higher parking charges for gas guzzlers. Curiously, though, the Lib Dems on the assembly did join with the Tories in opposing the extension of the congestion charging zone and the new tram scheme planned for west London.
