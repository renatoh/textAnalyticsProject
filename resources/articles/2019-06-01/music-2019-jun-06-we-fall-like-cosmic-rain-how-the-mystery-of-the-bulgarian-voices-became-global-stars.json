Le Myst\u00e8re Des Voix Bulgares, as they were then known, won a Grammy and were partly responsible for the creation of a new genre \u2013 world music \u2013 as record company executives debated how their unique music (and that of newly popular African bands) should be displayed in record stores. Their admirers ranged from Kate Bush, who had them sing on three songs from her 1989 album The Sensual World, to David Bowie and his wife Iman, who chose one of their songs to replace Here Comes the Bride at their wedding. And then there was Lisa Gerrard of experimental ambient duo Dead Can Dance, who had moved to London from Australia with Brendan Perry and signed to 4AD, the same indie label as Voix Bulgares. Gerrard says that the Bulgarian women changed her life at a time when music was all \u201cpost-punk, towards Joy Division. I never really connected with that very dark and very depressed side of the work that Brendan connected with. I was ready to give up. But when I heard the Bulgarians, they were my saving grace because I just loved the pure joy and the pure light \u2013 it just hits you straight in the belly. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have survived London as a singer if I had not come into contact with their work\u201d. Now, more than 30 years later, she is singing with the latest line-up of the choir, re-branded as the more mundane The Mystery of the Bulgarian Voices. She appears on, and even co-wrote, some of the songs on their new album BooCheeMish, their first release in two decades; tonight, she makes her first UK appearance with the choir, at London\u2019s Southbank Centre. There will be 18 choir members on stage, aged from 24 to 71: the oldest, Elena Bozhkova, is the only one to have sung on those best-selling 4AD albums. She grew up in a little Bulgarian village and was taught to sing in the traditional style by her mother. In 1972, when she was at home and raising her children, she auditioned successfully for the State Television and Radio Female Voice Choir, which had been founded in 1952. In what was then communist Bulgaria, she was \u201cpaid as a state employee\u201d, as part of the government\u2019s cultural strategy to stop any anti-socialist influences creeping into the country\u2019s music scene, and instead to create a new progressive music influenced by Bulgarian folk styles. So the women didn\u2019t just sing traditional material, but elaborate and sophisticated modern choral compositions, often based on women\u2019s village songs. The choir was recorded by a Swiss musicologist, Marcel Cellier, who included their songs on a 1975 album that he marketed as Le Myst\u00e8re Des Voix Bulgares. Sales were not impressive, but more than a decade later Peter Murphy, the lead singer of goth legends Bauhaus, became fascinated by the album and persuaded 4AD to re-release it. Bozhkova\u2019s life would never be the same. \u201cWe were happy, but not proud,\u201d she says. \u201cWe did not feel like stars, just like normal people.\u201d Still, the choir now found themselves at vast auditoriums in Los Angeles, \u201cor being told to sing barefoot in India \u2026 or singing from the third floor overlooking a square in Turin, with the conductor down on the ground, as pictures of Monet or Picasso were projected over us and our voices fell like cosmic rain over the audience\u201d. As for their celebrity followers, Bush was \u201cfriendly\u201d but Bozhkova was more excited by Bobby McFerrin: \u201cI was moved by him,\u201d she says. When the end of communism meant they no longer enjoyed guaranteed state wages, the choir decided to continue. And their style remained the same, using quarter tones, drone effects, unexpected rhythms and what Bozhkova describes as \u201copen-throat singing \u2026 which is not painful if studied from childhood. If you don\u2019t know the technique you can damage the vocal cords.\u201d As Gerrard had learned, back in the 80s. After hearing the Bulgarians, she co-wrote the eerie and haunting Dead Can Dance song The Host of Seraphim, which she performed on tour and \u201cnearly destroyed my voice trying to sing like them without proper guidance\u201d. Now, after a career that has involved winning a Golden Globe (with Hans Zimmer) for her score for Gladiator, she is finally working with the Bulgarians: \u201cI had to cross the river into their world rather than pull them into mine.\u201d Touring Europe together in a battered bus has helped them bond. \u201cIn Germany, the ladies excitedly tried to enter what looked like a Tudor pub, because they thought it was where we were staying,\u201d Gerrard says. \u201cThen a policeman with a huge dog came out and said it was a police station they were trying to break into. I love those women!\u201d Bozhkova says she welcomed the collaboration and that the choir \u201cliked the result\u201d, although Gerrard felt the Bulgarians were initially cautious of her. \u201cBut now we trust each other \u2013 and how could I resist being involved in the most beautiful thing I have ever heard?\u201d The Mystery of the Bulgarian Voices feat Lisa Gerrard are at the QEH, London Southbank tonight.
