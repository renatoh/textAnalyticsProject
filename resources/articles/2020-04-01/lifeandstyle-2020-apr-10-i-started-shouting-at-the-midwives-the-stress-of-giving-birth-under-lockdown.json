She arrived at the Royal Free hospital with her husband, Charles, at 5.30am the following day. \u201cWe were hoping for the best,\u201d Simmons says. Instead, Charles was sent home because of new visitor restrictions brought about by the outbreak, and Simmons was sent to a labour ward on her own. She was hungry \u2013 she hadn\u2019t brought enough food with her \u2013 so Charles dropped some off and stayed with her for a few hours before being ordered to leave again. For the next 10 hours, Simmons was in labour alone and Charles was relegated to a waiting room outside, like a Mad Men-era husband. It was tough. \u201cThe hardest bit of labour isn\u2019t the pushing,\u201d Simmons says. \u201cIt\u2019s the contractions. And doing that alone \u2026 you don\u2019t realise you need your partner so much, emotionally and physically, until you can\u2019t have that person there with you.\u201d After a 30-hour labour, the majority of that time spent alone, their daughter, Isla, was born on 1 April at 4.40am. Charles was allowed in to watch Isla being born before being ushered out. It certainly wasn\u2019t the birth they had hoped for or planned. Yet Simmons feels the experience meant she discovered an inner strength she hadn\u2019t known she had. \u201cIt gave me a newfound respect for women through history,\u201d she says. As the coronavirus pandemic continues, pregnant women across the country will be wondering how it will affect them. \u201cIt\u2019s an anxious time for pregnant women,\u201d says Maria Booker of the charity Birthrights. \u201cThey are concerned about whether their partner can stay with them or what the birth will be like.\u201d At the moment, according to official guidance, no British woman should have to give birth alone. \u201cVisiting is restricted to help stop the spread of coronavirus,\u201d says NHS England, \u201cbut our guidance is absolutely clear that a specific exception should be made for birthing partners when a woman is in labour.\u201d The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) guidelines state that partners may not be able to accompany women during their induction and the early stages of labour because of physical distancing guidelines. But it adds: \u201cAt the point you go into active labour, you will be moved to your own room and your birth partner will be able to join you.\u201d Provided, of course, they are not showing any signs of illness. No visitors are allowed post-birth. But there is a degree of confusion about how the rules are being enforced by different trusts. Simmons spent most of her labour alone, but others have partners with them throughout. A business owner from London, Naomi Edmondson, 29, gave birth to a baby boy at St Mary\u2019s hospital in Paddington on 31 March. Her husband, Ally, was allowed to stay with her throughout her planned C-section. What may be noticeable to mothers giving birth, however, is that hospitals seem emptier. A recent survey by the RCM found that 20% of midwife roles are currently unfilled because of self-isolation, coronavirus or existing staff shortages. Last week, Lynsay Coventry, 54, died at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex. She was the first midwife to die of Covid-19, showing the risks healthcare professionals are taking when carrying out their jobs. Emily Botelho, a 30-year-old artist from Manchester, delivered a baby boy safely on 30 March. Her partner, Richard, was allowed to be by her side. But afterwards, she overheard the midwives on her hospital ward discussing the staff shortages. \u201cThere was a bit of chatter about one of the maternity wards possibly having to close, as the staff were off sick and self-isolating,\u201d she says. Many trusts are cancelling home and water births because they require more staff. However, Booker says: \u201cWe\u2019d ask that trusts think carefully before pulling their home birth services.\u201d She urges them to think creatively about how to work around staff shortages; some trusts are using private ambulances to serve their home birth teams, to take the pressure off NHS ambulance crews. Martha San, a 30-year-old personal assistant from London, found out through Facebook that her planned home birth had been cancelled because of a shortage of ambulances. Her midwife had planned to call her, but the news broke online first. San had postnatal depression after her first pregnancy, and had planned a home birth to minimise the chances of her mental health deteriorating. \u201cThe idea was to have the baby in an environment I felt comfortable in,\u201d she says. When it came to it, \u201cthe birth was great\u201d, says San. Her husband, Jamie, was by her side and baby River arrived safely on 29 March at Lewisham hospital in south London. \u201cThe fact I was not at home didn\u2019t matter.\u201d But doctors wanted to keep River in for tests and so San had to spend two nights in hospital alone because Jamie had been sent home. Her ward was noisy, and she couldn\u2019t sleep. At 2am on the second night, San broke down. \u201cI started shouting at the midwives and crying,\u201d San says. \u201cI said that I wasn\u2019t meant to be there, this hadn\u2019t been the plan, I shouldn\u2019t be left alone with the baby and I wasn\u2019t coping.\u201d A midwife moved San to an empty ward so she could get some sleep, and looked after River for a few hours. They were discharged the next morning. But having to spend two nights in hospital alone with a newborn baby was distressing. \u201cIt just felt really wrong,\u201d San says. \u201cAfter the birth, I needed someone there and I didn\u2019t have anyone.\u201d Coronavirus also threw Rachael Collier-Thomas\u2019s birth plans out of the window. The 38-year-old mother from Hertfordshire had planned to have a water birth, but it was cancelled. \u201cWhen they told me I couldn\u2019t have my water birth, I joked that I\u2019d rather give birth to the baby at home than in a labour ward,\u201d Collier-Thomas says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t actually expect that to happen.\u201d When her waters broke on 24 March, the contractions were so mild that she carried on pottering at home. \u201cI thought I could be like that for days.\u201d A few hours later, Collier-Thomas felt an urge to push. \u201cI thought: it can\u2019t be the baby \u2013 it\u2019s too early,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t even called the hospital.\u201d Collier-Thomas delivered her daughter, Lottie, on her (formerly) white sofa, with the help of a local doula who had raced around. She is adamant that she didn\u2019t seriously plan to have her daughter at home. \u201cI know that home births can be dangerous,\u201d Collier-Thomas says. \u201cBut maybe, subconsciously, I thought: \u2018I really don\u2019t want to have my baby on the labour ward.\u2019\u201d Collier-Thomas is not alone: as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, other British women are turning to freebirthing, giving birth without any medical support. Some are concerned about the risk of contracting coronavirus in hospital; others have had their planned home births cancelled, and prefer to go it alone, without even midwives on hand. But having your baby at home, without medical supervision, can lead to a greater risk of complications. All the women I spoke to understand the pressures the NHS is under \u2013 and are not bitter that their births didn\u2019t go as planned. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be upset,\u201d says Simmons, when your own birth does not go to plan \u201cbecause there\u2019s so much going on. I totally get it.\u201d Even though San\u2019s hospital stay was upsetting, she has nothing but praise for the midwives doing their best under such difficult circumstances. \u201cThey were doing an incredible job,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they can\u2019t play the role of midwife and birth partner to every woman on the ward.\u201d The strangeness of giving birth during a pandemic doesn\u2019t end when you get home, though. Given the lockdown, many families won\u2019t meet newborn arrivals for weeks, if not months. Helena (not her real name), a 25-year-old teacher from Edinburgh, gave birth to her first child at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 24 March. \u201cThe staff were brilliant,\u201d she says. \u201cCalm and supportive.\u201d But not being able to rely on family or friends for childcare is tough. \u201cWe\u2019re first-time parents trying to figure it out, without family for support,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful and overwhelming.\u201d For some, coronavirus has cast a shadow over a joyful time. \u201cIt\u2019s really tainted everything,\u201d says Chloe Goodman, 38, a solicitor from Macclesfield. She gave birth to her daughter, Clara, on 20 March. Goodman describes the care she received at Macclesfield district general hospital as \u201cbrilliant\u201d. But she feels upset Clara won\u2019t meet her grandparents for months. \u201cThey\u2019re only tiny for such a short period of time,\u201d Goodman says. \u201cThey change so quickly.\u201d Helena is also finding things strange. \u201cI should be showing my baby off and going out and seeing people. But, instead, I\u2019m sitting at home, feeling scared.\u201d Many expectant mothers may be contemplating their births with trepidation. And the whisper networks of expecting-mum WhatsApp and Facebook groups can be frightening. \u201cI\u2019d been freaking out before the birth and imagining the worst,\u201d says Edmondson. \u201cBut actually being in the hospital was the least worrying part of it all.\u201d Edmondson urges women to ignore the rumour mill, and trust the NHS. \u201cIn the hospital, it\u2019s not as bad as everyone says,\u201d she adds. \u201cFor me, it was calm, and when you have your baby you\u2019re in this lovely bubble. You\u2019re not paying attention to all the scary stuff people are posting on social media.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
