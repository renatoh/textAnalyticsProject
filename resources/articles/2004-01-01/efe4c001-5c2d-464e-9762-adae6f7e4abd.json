But what the mostly female audience really wanted to talk about was football. The next night, the design duo were hosting a cocktail party at their menswear store for the launch of their new book Calcio, Italian for soccer, featuring photographs of Italian football stars such as Alessandro del Piero (right) and Carlo Cudicini. At another flagship store, Giorgio Armani was hosting a party for his book, Faces of Sport, an exhibition of athletes of various sorts, all looking suitably buff. The reason? To keep some sense of masculinity about menswear. For every metrosexual male who wouldn't have a problem wearing a kitten T-shirt there are more who are scared off by anything too fashion. By maintaining links with sportsmen, designers appear inclusive instead of terrifying. They are are also being benevolent: proceeds from both books, available in the the designers' stores, go to charity. Personally, I prefer a kitten T-shirt, but horses for courses. Pretend you know all about: McQueen menswear It was a sad day when Alexander McQueen stopped doing menswear. Although they sold well, he halted the line when Gucci Group bought his label, because he felt it necessary to concentrate on strengthening the women's collection. That done, McQueen's menswear returned with a non-catwalk presentation of his tailoring-heavy autumn/winter '04 range. For many, it was the collection of the week. McQueen's great skill is in the cut - his jackets are broad with properly constructed shoulders (an unfinished jacket was displayed to show his traditional methods) then follow tight down into the body, yet they are somehow forgiving and flattering around the stomach. These aren't rushed designs knocked out to capitalise on the buzz around a brand, McQueen has clearly put his heart into them. As well as stand-out tailored pieces, such as the tuxedo jacket held by a thin leather belt, there were also some great trompe l'oeil trend buys: T-shirt sleeves sewn under a vest, a shirt collar peeking out of a cashmere sweater. Buyers from stores excited about reintroducing the collections say the prices aren't too bad either (ie, really expensive, but not hideously so). Overheard: 'Prances with wolves' As said about Kevin Costner and his super-confident strut to his front row seat at Ralph Lauren this week"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
