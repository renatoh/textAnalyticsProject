Both managers desperately need to bring the best out of supposedly star summer signings but seem unsure precisely what to do with Asamoah Gyan and Stephen Ireland respectively. As has become the norm Gyan, the Ghanaian international striker, began on the bench, stepping off it when, deep in the second half, Bruce switched from the default mode 4\u20135\u20131 to 4\u20134\u20132. Although Gyan menaced, his arrival coincided with a period of defensive instability for Sunderland who, suddenly sitting far too deep, proved vulnerable to counterattacks. The problem is how to keep Gyan and Darren Bent content while preserving a lone-striker configuration which has afforded such stability that Sunderland are now unbeaten in seven. Well aware Bent is much admired by rivals, Bruce is unwilling to relocate him to the more unglamorous left-sided role generally filled by Danny Welbeck. Despite starting for Villa on Saturday, Ireland played so badly behind Emile Heskey that Houllier took him off in the 55th minute and later admitted that a midfielder whose touch and vision were seen as integral to Villa's latest European challenge looked \"a bit lost\". Like Bruce, Houllier is struggling to balance security with potential risk. Were he to start Gyan alongside Bent, Sunderland might start winning more games but their midfield could also be over-stretched and an apparently much-improved defence exposed. Similarly, Villa's manager would arguably be better deploying Ireland \u2013 described by insiders at his former club, Manchester City as \"in the top 5% talent wise, but the bottom 5% mental-strength wise\" \u2013 in a deeper role, from where he could dictate play. Unfortunately, though, that would interefere with Houllier's rehabilitation of Nigel Reo-Coker alongside Stilian Petrov in a reinforced central-midfield department designed to provide Stewart Downing and Ashley Young with a secure platform from which to attack down the wings. An early knee injury which necessitated Petrov's withdrawal weakened Villa on an afternoon when they deserved a draw but departed with nothing courtesy of an own goal from Richard Dunne, who diverted Steed Malbranque's cross into Villa's net. Houllier said yesterday that Petrov could be out of action for at least two to three weeks. \"He will have a scan. I think it could be a lateral ligament injury which may mean two or three weeksif it is a grade one injury. If it's a grade two or three, maybe it could be longer.\" Houllier's side enjoyed the superior chances \u2013 most notably when Downing struck a post and Heskey spurned a sitter \u2013 but still lacked the inspiration Ireland was signed to provide. \"I don't know Stephen Ireland well, I've only been here a month,\" said Villa's manager. \"His work-rate and attitude have been OK. He played very well against Chelsea [in a 0-0 draw] but he looked a bit lost today. It happens to the best players \u2013 and maybe he didn't play too much at Manchester City last season.\" At least Downing, deployed \"inside out\" on the right, looks as if he has begun slowly regaining the form which once kept City's Adam Johnson in Middlesbrough's reserves. Like Sunderland, the erstwhile England winger is enjoying a quiet renaissance. \"Sunderland have a bit more steel about them this year,\" Downing said. \"They've added something. They made it really hard for us in midfield. Players like Lee Cattermole are hard to get around and then, if you manage that, they've got good centre-halves. They'll be one of those teams pushing Villa for a Europa League spot. The owner is backing them and they're going to be a real threat. They've got a decent manager and have bought well. Gyan looks useful.\" If it will be intriguing to see where Ireland features in Villa's plans for Sunday's derby at home to Birmingham, many Sunderland fans would like to see Gyan starting Sunday's equally parochial encounter at St James' Park. As a boyhood Newcastle fan it represents a special occasion for Bruce. \"I've never been to the [Tyne-Wear] derby before, never mind being involved in one, so I'm looking forward to it immensely,\" he said. \"I can't wait.\" Maybe Gyan and Ireland do not quite have the monopoly on impatience after all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
