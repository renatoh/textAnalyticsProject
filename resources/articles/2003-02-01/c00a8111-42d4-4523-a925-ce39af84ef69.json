Mind you, if you trust Championship Manager so is Ade Akinbiyi. And Martin \"El Loco\" Palermo, the evening dress and feather boa-wearing Argentinian with a first-class degree from the University of Manchester Institute of Science &amp; Technology. Yet, despite a glowing computer reference, Saviola (nicknamed the 'Rabbit' because of his teeth and his scampering runs) hasn't convinced everyone in Spain - although he scored seventeen last season, he was never undisputed first-choice striker for either the nasally endowed Charly Rexach or Louis Van Gaal. Now, though, Saviola is flying. Pulled out of new manager Radi Antic's hat, the Rabbit ran, ran, ran Internazionale ragged in midweek and on Saturday night he bagged the first hat-trick of his career as FC Barcelona destroyed Real Betis 4-0, to rack up their fourth win in five games. It's quite a turn around. The last time the two sides met, back in September, Betis destroyed Bar\u00e7a with a performance that prompted the season's most memorable, and frankly disturbing, match report. AS's excitable, carnally obsessed Alejandro Delm\u00e1s - thankfully given his own press box, complete with wipe-clean surfaces - described the match as an \"Orgasmo B\u00e9tico\". \"Betis enjoyed a night of easy sex at the expense of the little housewife Barcelona. Van Gaal only wanted his players to produce Meg Ryan's banana-related fake orgasm ... Betis's players are capable of seducing Jennifer L\u00f3pez, how could they not have their way with Mendieta, Puyol or Fernando Navarro? ... Barcelona were absolutely violated\", he wrote freakily, before really shooting his, er, mouth off: \"Alfonso's penalty broke Bar\u00e7a's hymen ... Joaqu\u00edn's strike was the glorious pre-climax ... while the winning goal was, no exaggeration, the frenzied climax itself\". That torrid night of abuse in Huelva signalled the start of Bar\u00e7a's shocking descent; Saturday's revenge was confirmation that, with Van Gaal and Joan Gaspart gone, things are looking up. Antic has got Bar\u00e7a playing with more freedom, more passion and more ability - only Gaizka Mendieta continues to wander aimlessly, looking bemused. The fans are back on side, the press has put away their knives (for now) and, just as importantly, Bar\u00e7a are starting to get lucky - Betis were not as bad as 4-0 suggests, certainly not in the first half. They hit the post three times, while Bar\u00e7a, 2-0 up after six minutes, had three shots and scored all of them. Not that Antic is claiming the credit. Er, oh, right: \"three shots, three goals - that's one for the Guinness book of records\", he crowed, \"you can put that medal round my neck\". Modest he may not be, but Antic deserves to gloat a bit, having so far defied the predictions. Yes, yes, including the one made by this column (based of the painful recollection of the mighty Oviedo plummeting pathetically at Antic's hands). But that was then (Son Moix, Mallorca 17 June 2001); this is now. And now, suddenly, all is dandy in Barcelona - the European quarters are all but assured, things are turning in the league and Luis Enrique is finally back to fitness. Which is a shame for the rest of Spain who, let's face it, would have laughed their heads off if Barcelona had gone down. Nonetheless, Antic's declared aim of a Champions League place (12 points away) is getting harder all the time - the top four have opened up a gap and won't let go easily. This weekend Real Sociedad held onto their brilliant lead for the 18th week running, thanks to a 2-0 victory over Osasuna, while Madrid, Depor and Valencia also kept up the pace. In truth, Madrid were diabolical against Valladolid, despite winning 3-1, but the same can't be said for Deportivo, who celebrated Javier Irureta's 500th game as a manager with a 6-0 trashing of Alav\u00e9s. Nor can it be said of Champions Valencia: Rafa Ben\u00edtez left out six first-teamers, including Pablo Aimar, was faced with the mighty Bolic, and played a guy called Dorothee (no, really) at right-back - yet still his team slaughtered Rayo 4-0. Yep, it's going to be hard - impossible - for Bar\u00e7a to catch the leaders. But few cul\u00e9s really care: it's enough that in just four league matches, Bar\u00e7a are looking up, not down. Suddenly everyone loves the Serb who famously sent David Pleat hopping across the pitch in glory like a deranged schoolgirl traversing a scolding hot hopscotch board. But while Antic basks in glory, it's Javier Saviola who has really taken the plaudits. His energy, movement and goals have been vital in Bar\u00e7a's revival, while the broadest of smiles (not including Cheri Blair's, obviously) reveals that he's a happy bunny again. So happy, in fact, that he even won over the Barcelona faithful by appearing on TV3, speaking his first words of Catalan. Which is a step beyond countryman Juan Pablo Sor\u00edn - the man with the most Argentinian hairdo of all time also wowed reporters with a touch of Catalan when he arrived. Only it was Portuguese. But for all his goals, the key to Saviola's happiness is the simple fact that he can finally sleep easy, without the hulking figure of Van Gaal's enormous head looming large in his darkest nightmares. It's true: this weekend, Saviola rather disturbingly admitted that \"Van Gaal made me do weird things for him - things no one had ever asked me to do before\".
