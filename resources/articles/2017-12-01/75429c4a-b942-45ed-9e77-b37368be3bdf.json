Chelsea will face Barcelona in what, among the top flight\u2019s five representatives, is the stand-out tie of this year\u2019s round of 16. If Conte seeks an omen he might take note that the last time the clubs met coincided with the most recent English winner, Chelsea coming through a tense last-four clash in 2012 before beating Bayern Munich in the final. The ensuing drought has rarely looked like being broken but he detects an increased threat this time. \u201cI think the first round showed great power for the English teams,\u201d Conte said. \u201cFour teams arrived at the top of their group and it means they are really strong. It will be difficult to face English teams, especially in February. But then in March, April, I don\u2019t know because when you accumulate many games in the players\u2019 legs it will be more difficult for them to reach something important. But at the same time this could be the right season for an English team to win the Champions League.\u201d The draw was made amid a problematic period for Chelsea domestically, with resources stretched and Conte in effect writing off their title defence after Saturday\u2019s defeat at West Ham. In that context his caveat about players\u2019 workloads, a theme he has broached repeatedly in recent days, was little surprise. He was reluctant to speak specifically about Barcelona\u2019s first-leg visit on 20 February, saying it \u201cmakes no sense\u201d to do so, although he did emphasise that the sides\u2019 previous meetings \u2013 they have played 12 times in the Champions League and Chelsea are unbeaten in the last seven \u2013 should be consigned to the past. Chelsea were, in fact, the only English team to occupy a group runners-up spot and most of their peers were accordingly granted ties that look less complicated. The exception was Spurs, whose hard work in disposing of Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund was rewarded with a fiendish tie against the 2016-17 runners-up Juventus. Tottenham defeated the same opponents 2-0 in a pre-season friendly at Wembley and Juve consider themselves forewarned. \u201cObviously we want to do better than we did back then,\u201d their vice-president Pavel Nedved said. \u201cThey\u2019re a very solid outfit with a great coach in Mauricio Pochettino, who manages to get the very best out of their attacking potential.\u201d Manchester City will be overwhelming favourites to defeat Basel, although the Swiss side\u2019s 1-0 victory over Manchester United last month may serve as a reminder that the runaway league leaders can take nothing for granted. Rapha\u00ebl Wicky, the Basel head coach, welcomed the chance to face a side he believes is \u201ccurrently the best in the world\u201d. United themselves will not be disappointed that Sevilla, who finished behind Liverpool in Group E, lie in wait, although former City players Nolito and Jes\u00fas Navas are capable of providing a sting in the tail. \u201cI dreamed that we would play Manchester United,\u201d Nolito said after the draw. J\u00fcrgen Klopp was pleased that Liverpool, dealt a tricky assignment against a Porto side who are capable of testing them defensively, will face the Portuguese leaders away from home first. \u201cThis year again they\u2019re a difficult side to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThey came through in a difficult group; they kept [RB] Leipzig \u2013 a really good side in Germany \u2013 behind them. It will be interesting. It\u2019s good that we have the first game at Porto, the weather is better there in February.\u201d The most high-profile tie of the round fell outside the Premier League sphere. Two of the tournament favourites, Paris Saint-Germain and the holders Real Madrid, must go head-to-head and the price of elimination will be high. The PSG chairman, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, looked ahead to some \u201cmagical football moments\u201d between the two but his under-pressure coach, Unai Emery, might have hoped for a smoother path to the latter stages than this.
