He flopped again yesterday against a part-time spinner, but Pietersen plays. This has become a matter of faith, and England's faith remains limitless. Among the worst outcomes for Pietersen yesterday would be that Mohammad Ashraful, Bangladesh A's captain, would try to cheer himself up after being omitted from the Test squad with a rare spell of off-spin and that Pietersen would get out to it. That is exactly what happened. Pietersen did hit Ashraful straight for six, and at least he was not terrorised by yet another slow left-armer, but his sequence of embarrassing failures goes on. He had made only 20 when he was bowled attempting to sweep in a game that had become little more than a glorified practice session. Perhaps that was the problem. Perhaps he was bored. The rest is not so certain. The most likely scenario for Friday's Test is that Stuart Broad will be passed fit, Graham Onions will be ruled out because of back trouble, and Jonathan Trott will win the opening batting spot ahead of Michael Carberry in a side containing five, not six, specialist batsmen. Things could change at any moment, of course. England selections for the sub-continent have always been more prone to last-minute chaos \u2013 most famously when Graham Gooch's hapless India tourists fell victim to rogue prawns in a Chinese restaurant 17 years ago. But take away the tendency for crustaceans to become agents of malign fate whenever an England cricket team comes to town and the picture is becoming clearer. Broad bowled six overs in the nets at lunch and bowled another three at tea. His presence is essential for England to balance the side. He will step up his training in the 48 hours before the match, and that will mean the daunting sight of England's fitness trainer, Huw Bevan, wielding a stopwatch. If he gets through that without a recurrence of the back spasms that he has not suffered since Sunday then a five-day Test will be a breeze. Another clear winner from England's drawn three-day affair against Bangladesh A is Middlesex's uncapped fast bowler, Steven Finn, who has made a strong case to be part of a three-strong pace attack, along with Broad and Tim Bresnan, to support the spin of Graeme Swann and James Tredwell. Finn joined the squad as cover, but England's coach, Andy Flower, was at pains to suggest that such a description can be misunderstood and that he is on an equal footing with the rest of the squad. There is no sense, it seems, of next cab off the rank. England's fast bowlers are better compared in any case to an army of tuk-tuks, all jostling for supremacy, all with inherent weaknesses and with the perpetual suspicion that an accident could be just around the corner. \"Onions tried bowling a bit today and struggled,\" England's coach Andy Flower said. \"Broad came through really well. He is OK at the moment, but we will see how he reacts to those exertions overnight. If he is OK, he will have a harder day tomorrow and again we will see how that goes.\" If Broad is unfit them the temptation to play six batsmen, a policy that served England well in the Ashes series last summer and on the subsequent tour to South Africa, will become irresistible. Only Broad batting at No7 will convince England that they have the necessary weight of batting, and even then they will take the decision reluctantly. If Broad's back suffers a relapse then Carberry will make his debut. To play only four specialist bowlers, backed by Paul Collingwood's off-cutters and Kevin Pietersen as a third off-spinner, would be a huge gamble if the two potential fast bowlers were drawn from Broad, who would still have some fitness concerns, Finn, on debut, and Bresnan, stout-hearted, yes, but with little Test bowling pedigree. \"It makes it a trickier decision without a doubt,\" Flower said. \"These are the sort of things that make the job interesting and challenging. Sometimes selection is really simple. This time it isn't. \"Finn was very impressive over the last three games. He got off the plane the afternoon before the game started. He bowled well and has pulled up OK physically. He is young, I don't know how raw he is, but he showed a lot of skill and he has the pace and bounce that all captains are looking for.\" Finn's morning figures of 6-5-5-1 came before lunch when the game was still worthy of respect, his wicket being the uprooting of Raqibul Hasan's off-stump, who had made 158 runs without being dismissed over two innings. Raqibul's efforts won him a Test spot ahead of Ashraful, whose attempts to find form in Dhaka domestic cricket have brought three ducks in four innings. Pietersen might reflect that there is always somebody worse off than you are. England then succumbed to the sort of declaration bowling that more than 20 years ago sounded the death knell for three-day championship cricket on covered pitches. Alastair Cook bowled five overs for 111, Carberry four overs for 78. It was a relief all round that this match by then had lost its first-class status.
