Ahead of the education minister, Dan Tehan, taking a support package to cabinet to be announced as early as next week, Plibersek told Guardian Australia that there are \u201cnow serious concerns that without federal government action some leading institutions could collapse\u201d. Universities, many of which rely on international students for more than a third of their revenue, are currently engaged in cost-cutting including asking staff to use up leave and instituting hiring freezes. But representatives of the sector have played down the risk, with Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, insisting they are \u201cnot asking for a bailout\u201d from government, only \u201csupport to help us weather the period ahead\u201d. Labor wants the government to provide universities with certainty by guaranteeing \u201cproper funding for Australian students\u201d, including paying at least the commonwealth grant scheme funding for the next three years based on projected student numbers before the 2019 budget. Plibersek also proposes \u201clow or no-cost loans to provide stability in coming months\u201d. \u201cAustralian universities are under immense pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cFor years, universities have used income from international education to help fund their world-leading research. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic, and global travel restrictions, have led to a crisis in this funding model, with income from international students plummeting over recent months. \u201cAustralia cannot afford to let our universities fall off a cliff. The federal government must act now to shore up our universities.\u201d In addition to employing almost 260,000 people, Plibersek cited universities\u2019 role in developing new treatments, cures and equipment and educating doctors, nurses and health experts, as reasons to support them. \u201cThey are absolutely critical to dealing with this urgent health crisis \u2013 and will be just as critical to our recovery in the years to come,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the federal government fails to act now, some universities could collapse, which would see vital research cut, thousands of jobs lost, and leave students hanging in the middle of degrees.\u201d Group of Eight universities tend to derive the most revenue from international students, although are considered very unlikely to fail due to their large asset bases. The greater concern is smaller regional universities that also derive a large proportion of revenue from international sources, such as Federation and Central Queensland universities. Jackson said that Universities Australia has \u201cbeen talking with government since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic about ways to best support university students and staff, research and teaching, and have greatly appreciated the collaborative approach\u201d. \u201cUniversities are not asking for a bailout,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cRather we are seeking government support to help us weather the period ahead, and come out the other side able to play our part in economic and community recovery.\u201d Luke Sheehy, executive director of the Australian Technology Network group of universities, said he \u201canticipates the government will consider additional funding for [the sector], and that would be welcome\u201d. \u201cWe hope that it will allow us to look after students and staff, and continue to conduct vital research including to combat Covid-19.\u201d Sheehy noted universities would feel the greatest impact in the second semester, when international students from the northern hemisphere begin studies in Australia.
