Never, confirms executive producer", "bodyText": "The future has looked shaky for cinema\u2019s biggest hero. The director of his latest adventure quit 14 weeks before shooting. The release date was pushed back. Not so long ago, the actor who plays him said he would rather slash his wrists than reprise the role. But there is one thing about which James Bond can rest easy: his manhood. Speaking to the Guardian, 007\u2019s executive producer Barbara Broccoli ruled out any Doctor Who-style gender reinvention for Ian Fleming\u2019s super-spy. \u201cBond is male,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a male character. He was written as a male and I think he\u2019ll probably stay as a male. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine. We don\u2019t have to turn male characters into women. Let\u2019s just create more female characters and make the story fit those female characters.\u201d Broccoli, 58, is the daughter of Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli, heads Eon productions and signs off on every key Bond hire and fire. It was she who tweeted the news Danny Boyle had left the 25th film due to \u201ccreative differences\u201d. She who announced Cary Fukunaga was to replace him. And she who lured Daniel Craig back into the tuxedo. Such leverage makes her perhaps the most powerful female producer the film industry has ever seen. It also makes her fiercely protective of the \u201cfamily business\u201d. Yes, she concedes, Bond cannot be considered a feminist property, but mostly because people tend to \u201creference those early movies. It was written in the 50s, so there\u2019s certain things in [Bond\u2019s] DNA that are probably not gonna change.\u201d \u201cBut look at the way the world has changed. And I think Bond has come through and transformed with the times. I\u2019ve tried to do my part, and I think particularly with the Daniel [Craig] films, they\u2019ve become much more current in terms of the way women are viewed\u201d Broccoli\u2019s close involvement with the series, starting aged 17, has been credited with keeping the set strikingly safe as a workplace for women. Rosamund Pike has spoken of her good fortune in Die Another Day (2002) being her first brush with Hollywood. \u201cI look back over my experience and think: \u2018My goodness, Barbara Broccoli was way ahead of all this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an ounce of feeling uncomfortable while I was on that set.\u201d Says Broccoli: \u201cI was allowed to \u2013 encouraged to \u2013 grow within the company and felt very supported by my father and my brother, Michael. So I always said what I thought if I didn\u2019t like something and sometimes they listened and sometimes they didn\u2019t. It gave me confidence at work to deal with whatever the scenario was. \u201cI\u2019m acutely aware of what actors have to go through. They have to expose the most vulnerable parts of themselves. I think you have to create an environment where people feel free to be able to do that and in the wider sense an environment where people feel free to experiment and not be ridiculed, not feel frightened to explore things and say things.\u201d When Bond 25 does start shooting at the start of next year, it will be Broccoli\u2019s first time working with a male director in years; her last three projects have all consciously championed female stories, and been directed by women. The most recent is Nancy, a drama about a vulnerable fantasist co-produced with its star, Andrea Riseborough, and which plays at the London film festival next week. The film, directed by Christina Choe, had a crew that was 80% female and 50% people of colour. It was, says Broccoli, a \u201cvery different, nurturing experience \u2026 the female resilience and solidarity was great\u201d. It was also one of remarkable industry. \u201cWe would wrap early every day,\u201d says Riseborough. \u201cThe multitasking was amazing.\u201d The actor was especially struck by the contrast once she returned to work on conventional sets, which average around 90% men. \u201cIt\u2019s so much better in Europe than in the US,\u201d she says. From Nancy, \u201cI went into something with Harvey [Weinstein] that was one of the hardest experiences I\u2019ve ever had in my life on set.\u201d The project, a mini-series about Waco, which has since had Weinstein\u2019s producer credit removed, featured Riseborough as a cult follower. \u201cI was playing someone older than myself so I\u2019d asked them to make me look worse. I wanted to look tired and drawn and at the end of my tether. So I was invisible when I walked on to that set. It was a big shock. \u201cAnd it was all men. I said to the first assistant director: \u2018Do you have any women on set?\u2019 And he said: \u2018You don\u2019t like to hear this, but it\u2019s a tough industry.\u2019 And we did not [finish on time] a day once.\u201d Riseborough has worked frequently with Weinstein \u2013 the mogul currently charged with multiple counts of rape and sexual assault, all of which he denies \u2013 including on her breakthrough role as Wallis Simpson in the Madonna-directed W.E. She is still coming to terms with his downfall, she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t quite believe how much you\u2019ve put up with. And how much you\u2019ve not followed your instincts on a very basic level. \u201cAnd it was collective. The people I admired also weren\u2019t speaking up. It was a very confusing, horrible situation. That\u2019s really all I can say about it: one of the hardest things I\u2019ve been through.\u201d To clarify: in terms of personal experience with Weinstein or the wider fallout? \u201cThe last year\u2019s reckoning. Because when you are being undermined or disrespected, you\u2019re not always aware of it. In a way I thought I was being lauded. It\u2019s confusing when you\u2019re always getting awards. You\u2019re being revered in some way. In one way you feel very powerful and in another way you feel like absolute shit. In a way it\u2019s like imposter syndrome.\u201d Weinstein\u2019s actions were, she suggests, enabled by an industry imbalance. \u201cAs a woman, I\u2019ve often had a sort of primal fear on set. You\u2019re surrounded by 19 men and you get this feeling inside: I might be overpowered. It\u2019s an old, animalistic, very natural thing. And I had somewhat tired of being in rooms like that. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to go through something really vulnerable. You might be reenacting sexual abuse \u2013 and you\u2019re surrounded by guys on a bedroom set. The whole thing can be re-traumatising.\u201d This atmosphere is not something from which you are insulated as a non-actor, says Broccoli. Has she too been the victim of sorts of ordeals now coming to light? \u201cOf course, all the time. Yes, there were some very major things in my life, but as Andrea was saying, it\u2019s really important we all keep sharing our stories. That\u2019s healing and we draw on each other\u2019s strengths.\u201d Broccoli\u2019s championing of female film-makers extends to a substantial role backing the Time\u2019s Up movement, established in the wake of the revelations about the conduct of Weinstein. The producer has funded much of the research into gender inequality which informs their statements, as well as the manufacture of pins supporting the movement to be worn by whoever feels moved to do so at the London film festival. The sight of Donald Trump mocking Christine Blasey Ford for her testimony against Brett Kavanaugh illustrates, say both women, the continued need for such pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s very disturbing,\u201d says Broccoli, \u201cwhen people like the President make [recounting an incident of sexual assault] sound like a bad thing. What could be worse than ridiculing a survivor? It\u2019s been so unacceptable for women to be angry; its the way we were raised.\u201d Such response has not been a surprise, says Riseborough. \u201cWe all now what it\u2019s like to feel you\u2019re pissing into the wind. We\u2019re only now beginning to see [on film] a woman from a woman\u2019s perspective, which has got to be the most exciting thing to happen in feminism ever. Broccoli says she hopes films such as Nancy will make audiences and the industry reconsider how women are viewed. Yet she acknowledges how much power for change is in her hands. Wouldn\u2019t hiring a female director \u2013 or screenwriter \u2013 on the next James Bond film send the strongest message? \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d says Broccoli. \u201cYou wanna make a great film and you wanna find the people who can make that film at that particular time. [But] as a female producer, of course I\u2019d like to do that.\u201d \u2022 Nancy is released in cinemas on 12 October and on DVD and download on 5 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
