Its function was \u201cto transmit vital information from the battlefront, ignoring the usual channels\u201d. On 30 April 1945 he was among the first to enter Stalag X-B concentration camp at Sandbostel, and the sight of the inmates never left him. He was born on a tenant farm in Grantchester, just outside Cambridge, the younger son of Scottish parents, Willie Laurie, a farmer who later worked for the Ely Beet Sugar Corporation, and Meg (nee Mundell), who took in paying guests at their home and during the war became a live-in housekeeper for Bishop George Chase, then master of Selwyn College, Cambridge. Alan\u2019s brother was Ran, the future Olympic oarsman. Alan was educated at Monkton Combe school, Bath, and Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he read history and represented Cambridge in the 1940 Boat Race. Commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1941, Alan was recruited in 1942 to Phantom. He served as patrol leader in North Africa, Sicily and northern Europe. While on leave from the army, and staying with his mother, Alan met Rosemary Woodhouse, a student from London who had been evacuated and was also staying at the Selwyn master\u2019s lodge. They were married in 1949. Alan became a schoolmaster and, after three years at King\u2019s school, Rochester (1947-50), he taught for 20 years at Shrewsbury school in Shropshire, eight of them as housemaster. His approach to running a boarding house liberalised the disciplinary structures of the time, and he aimed to have a talk with each boy at least once a week. Many former pupils have paid their respects to him as an inspiring master. Introduced at Shrewsbury to the 1879 book Progress and Poverty, by the economist Henry George, Alan was drawn to the Liberal party, and served as a Liberal borough councillor while a housemaster, before standing as a parliamentary candidate for Shrewsbury in the 1979 general election, pushing Labour into second place. In 1970 Alan was appointed principal of the Royal Normal College for the Blind (now the Royal National College for the Blind). He was credited with saving the institution from closure, and in 1976 became the first warden of College Hill House, Shrewsbury. Under his guidance College Hill House became the Gateway Education and Arts Centre. Outside work, and far into retirement near Ludlow, Alan engaged in voluntary community projects. He trained and worked as a marriage guidance counsellor and a prison visitor, and played major parts in the development of Home Start, the Teme Valley Youth Project and the Bishop Mascall Centre (now the Ludlow Mascall Centre) in Ludlow. Alan was recently made a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur for his services during the Normandy campaign. He opposed cutting ties with Europe and objected strongly to the \u201ctribalism\u201d peddled by some British politicians. Alan is survived by Rosemary and their four children, Ian, Margaret, Ranald and me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
