If we continue to operate from a predominantly biologically-based mental illness position, as opposed to taking a more holistic mental health position, then I fear that we will continue to experience the disappointments, failures and stigma so commonly experienced in mental health work. Fundamentally, it is the design of the car that is the problem, not the amount of fuel it receives. Dr Adam Burley Clinical psychologist, Edinburgh Homeless Practice \u00b7 Matt Muijen speaks nostalgically about his time as chief executive of the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, when he had 60 staff working on the whole national mental health agenda. Well, he wouldn't recognise the organisation now. This summer, the Sainsbury Centre underwent a brutal restructuring that made around 50 staff redundant and narrowed the organisation's focus to just two areas of work. That one of these is the issue of employment and mental health is a superb irony. Many dedicated staff were lost, and an organisation that had influenced government policy and was valued by mental health professionals and service users has become an insignificant player on the mental health stage. Name and address withheld Realistic reviews The problem with NHS governance (Opinion, October 25) is that what is inspected is the paperwork, not the practice. Armies of managers and clinicians tick all the boxes they can while what actually happens to patients is not witnessed at all. A peer review method, in which multi-disciplinary teams drawn from all over the country inspected trusts at work - with warning, of course - would be more real. Dr Sebastian Kraemer Consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, Whittington hospital Leave well alone Peter Hetherington is right in highlighting the perceived \"attraction\" of directly elected mayors (Time to let go, October 25) and this has been reflected in the local government white paper. But let's not get too carried away. It is common among advocates of directly elected mayors to see them as an intrinsically necessary aspect of public service reform and a panacea for democratic and decision-making ills. But in locations where political values, strong local parties and a belief in local councillors and participative structures are burgeoning, they should be allowed to do so without this unnecessary distraction. In our largest cities their introduction could project a \"politics of personality\" culture on to a governance approach that has been embedded over a number of years via elected members, cooperation between councils and citizenship participation through partnerships and involvement mechanisms. Neil McInroy Chief executive, Centre for Local Economic Strategies Well-earned breaks Glad to see the issue of care in old age addressed (Future imperfect, October 25). Speaking as a 67-year-old, I am urged to put my savings towards my future care. If I am tempted to spend them on a good holiday or two while I can, leaving the government to pay for the drips, the beds, and the drugs necessary to keep me miserably alive, am I totally irresponsible? I don't think so. Penelope Farmer London Keep it real It's a delight to read Stewart Dakers' well-written and passionate piece (Real estate, October 25) that is clearly so well informed.
