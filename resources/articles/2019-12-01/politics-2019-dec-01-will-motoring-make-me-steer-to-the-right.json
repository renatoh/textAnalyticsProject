How disappointing to be fobbed off with the \u201copaque cliche\u201d of Julie Andrews\u2019 biography when I could have been reading Debbie Harry\u2019s \u201cterrific\u201d book or Elton John\u2019s \u201ccelebrity memoir of the year\u201d. Note to my offsprings\u2019 partners: I don\u2019t want slippers or bath cubes either. Jane Bakowski Tunbridge Wells, Kent \u2022 Simon Jenkins\u2019 article (This election will be all about identity. The Tories know it, Journal, 29 November) reminded me of an incident when I was knocking on doors canvassing for the Doncaster local elections in 1975. A man came to the door and explained: \u201cI have always voted Labour. But I\u2019ve bought a car. And now that I\u2019m a motorist I think I should vote Conservative.\u201d Digby Sewell Driffield, East Yorkshire \u2022 Michael Horan\u2019s praise of the use of \u201cattendant\u201d (Letters, 29 November) overlooks the fact that the meaning of \u201cattendee\u201d is universally understood. Does he prefer to think of himself as a \u201cpedant\u201d or a \u201cpedee\u201d? Ian Broadbridge Bristol \u2022 We\u2019ve just had Black Friday. Now how about a White Friday \u2013 maybe the first Friday of each December \u2013 as a day for giving to charities or to individuals who are needier than us? Hilary Wakeman Norwich \u2022 Jonathan Miller did not say \u201cI\u2019m not really a Jew, just Jew-ish\u201d in an interview (Letters, 29 November); it is from a Beyond the Fringe sketch.
