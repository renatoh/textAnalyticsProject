Depending on who you ask, the world's biggest economy is either a hair's breadth from disaster, or well on the road to recovery. Since the Fed's move in September, there has been relentless optimism among US investors, never mind the backlog of unsold homes, the weak pace of job creation, and a package of measures from the White House to help struggling families avoid repossession. Gabriel Stern, of Lombard Street Research, calls it the 'United States of Denial'. He says the attitude of investors seems to be: 'The news is good? The economy is booming. The news is bad? The Fed will cut interest rates, the economy will boom.' Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, may have acted decisively, evoking memories in the markets of the 'Greenspan put' - his predecessor's predilection for cutting rates to rescue investors in hard times - but fears are rising that the credit crunch will take many months to resolve, and create a damaging vicious circle. It all started with American homeowners, who took advantage of rock-bottom interest rates to stretch their borrowing to the limit and buy a slice of the property boom. They were aided by Greenspan's Fed, which slashed rates to 1 per cent in 2003, to coax the economy back into life after the dotcom bubble burst, and kept them there for a year. Seventeen rate rises later, the housing boom ran out of steam. Home-buyers began defaulting in their droves - and the banks which had lent money on increasingly lax terms received a shock. Lenders have responded by ratcheting up interest rates, and tightening their standards, but that could cause yet more pain in the housing market, creating a feedback loop, with higher borrowing costs sparking more defaults - and exacerbating the lenders' woes. 'The depression in the housing market has been turbo-charged by what happened to credit markets over the summer,' says Richard Iley, of BNP Paribas. 'Banks and building societies have been continuing to tighten lending standards aggressively. We're going to see substantial house price falls on a national basis for the first time since the Thirties.' The scale of the downturn in the property market has been extraordinary: prices are already down more than 3 per cent on a year earlier, home-building has dropped by a fifth - and more wary lenders can only make things worse. Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economics professor, has calculated that housing wealth is worth $21trn - so even a 20 per cent total decline in prices could cut consumer spending by $200bn, and could easily push the US into recession. Paul Ashworth, of Capital Economics, suggests Friday's drop in the Michigan measure of consumer confidence, to a 14-month low, could be an early sign that the belt-tightening is about to begin, as homeowners adjust to higher interest rates, and the realisation that the value of their homes is no longer rocketing. 'It seems that the collapse in the housing market is beginning to have a more marked impact,' he says. 'This backs our view that the outlook for consumption remains grim'. In March, Ben Bernanke reassured Congress that although the housing market was in the grip of a 'substantial correction', it was too early to panic, and 'the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the sub-prime market seems likely to be contained'. Just six months later, at the height of the credit crunch, he was cutting rates, 'to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets'. The question now is whether the worst is over. The precedents are not good. Sharp falls in housing investment have preceded eight of the last 10 US recessions, according to academic Edward Leamer. He argues that the Fed should pay close attention to the pace of housing construction when it sets monetary policy, moving interest rates up earlier, to prevent housing bubbles getting out of control. 'This would create pre-emptive anti-inflation policy in the middle of the expansions when housing is not so sensitive to interest rates, making it less likely that anti-inflation policies would be needed near the ends of expansions when housing is very interest-rate sensitive, thus making our recessions less frequent and/or less severe,' he said in a recent paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. If Leamer is right, Bernanke and his colleagues may already be behind the curve. Yet the minutes from the Fed's rate-cutting meeting suggested they were in no hurry to cut rates again, saying 'all agreed that some inflation risks remained'. With the credit crunch so far confined mainly to US financial giants, Bernanke may be wary of being seen to bail out irresponsible lenders with cuts. 'The Fed could well decide it has done enough for now and stay on hold, but that would significantly increase the risks of recession in 2008,' says Graham Turner, of GFC Economics. 'If it does not cut again, the credit crisis of August/September will return with a vengeance.' And although it may no longer be true that - as the saying went - when America sneezes, the world catches a cold, a recession in the US would have serious knock-on effects. For the UK, where the financial services sector has been a key engine of GDP growth in recent years, the implications could be serious."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
