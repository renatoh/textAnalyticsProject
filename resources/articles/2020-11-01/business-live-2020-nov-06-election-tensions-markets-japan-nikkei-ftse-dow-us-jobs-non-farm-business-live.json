Global stock markets have posted their strongest weekly gains since April, as Joe Biden moves closer and closer to the US presidency. The S&amp;P 500 index of US companies has put on 7% this week, rebounding strongly from last week\u2019s losses. That\u2019s the strongest rally since markets were recovering from their March plunge: Investors are welcoming the prospect of some political certainty, after a long and gruelling campaign. Eyes are now turning to the issue of a new fiscal stimulus package. Oliver Jones, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, told the Guardian: There\u2019s definitely some relief that things like tougher tax policy, tougher corporate reforms look to be off the table without Democrats having more control over Congress. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s going to look more like a continuation of the status quo, which is the outcome favoured by most firms,\u201d However, the battle for the Senate is not officially over -- it could be unresolved until January, if both Georgia seats are decided by a run-off that could result in a 50:50 split. Control of the Senate would determine the size of the next fiscal stimulus package, and the prospects of tax reforms and regulations on Big Tech In London, the FTSE 100 has posted its best week since June, ending at a three-week high. The global rally also pushed Japan\u2019s Nikkei to its highest close in 29 years -- since its 1980s asset boom exploded. The latest US jobs report has shown the challenge facing the White House. Encouragingly, the unemployment rate has fallen sharply to 6.9% last month, with the Non-Farm Payroll jumping by 638,000. But that still means 10 million jobs have still been lost since the pandemic began. In other news... More than 860 people have immediately lost their jobs and a further 2,000 roles are at risk after the Edinburgh Woollen Mill chain and the homewares retailer Ponden Home called in administrators. UK house prices have risen at the fastest annual rate in more than four years in October. EasyJet is cutting its flight schedule further after the introduction of new lockdown measures in the UK and mainland Europe, and will only run a maximum of 20% of planned flights for the rest of the year. Stay tuned to our brilliant US Politics Live blog for the latest action in the election - with Joe Biden due to speak later.... GW Back in the UK, meanwhile, a grim week for job losses has become even worse. The Edinburgh Woollen Mill chain and the homewares retailer Ponden Home have called in administrators, meaning more than 860 people have immediately lost their jobs and a further 2,000 roles are at risk. My colleague Sarah Butler has the details: The two chains will continue to trade online, and in stores where possible, while administrators seek options for their future, including potential buyers. The job losses mainly relate to the permanent closure of 56 Edinburgh Woollen Mill stores and eight Ponden Home stores and concessions. The latest cuts come after a dismal week for retail workers in which more than 5,700 more jobs came under threat. Sainsbury\u2019s said up to 3,500 jobs could go as it shut four in five of its Argos high street stores and closed fresh fish, meat and deli counters, while John Lewis is cutting 1,500 head office jobs and footwear brand Clarks could lose an estimated 700 jobs in stores. Wall Street will keep trading for a few hours yet (until 4pm EST or 9pm GMT). But with Europe and Asia-Pacific markets closed, we\u2019re looking at the best week for world markets since April. Reuters has the details: Global stock markets edged higher and the dollar sank to a two-month low on Friday as investors awaited final vote processing in the U.S. presidential election that showed Joe Biden on the verge of winning the White House. Treasury yields rose on better-than-expected October employment data, while oil prices slid below $40 a barrel as new lockdowns in Europe to halt the surging COVID-19 pandemic dimmed the demand outlook. MSCI\u2019s all-country world stock index rose 0.19% to 592.5, adding to a week-long rally that has seen the benchmark for global equity markets advance more than 7%. The index is on course for its best week in nearly seven months. Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York, says investors are welcoming some certainty: \u201cThe market perhaps is starting to cheer there being some certainty to the election. There was some skittishness to the bond market when elections were too close to call. So the risk premium associated with a prolonged election uncertainty gets priced out.\u201d Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at ThinkMarkets, says this week\u2019s surging markets shows that investors are anticipate a much-needed, and long-awaited, stimulus package. If, by the start of the new week, Biden is confirmed as the winner, we may well see some further strength for risk assets in the early parts of the week ahead. Judging by the big rally in equities this week, investors seemingly prefer a constrained new president at the White House. A Biden win is likely to pave the way for a big fiscal stimulus package. While the Republicans at the senate will provide some resistance, the fact that Biden now has a mandate makes it less likely that they will block a bigger package than what they were previously prepared to sign. Regardless of the stimulus package, a Republican-controlled senate will make it unlikely that Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts will be rolled back for years to come. So, government support will be there in one or another form to support the economic recovery. Wall Street has now erased those early losses, with investors perhaps concluding that political events are now priced in. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are currently up 0.02% for the day, with some traders perhaps more interested in votes than shares. That leaves the New York market up a punchy 7% for the week, the best in almost seven months. Phew! After a thoroughly tense, dramatic and downright exhausting week, Britain\u2019s stock market has ended the day..... where it started! The FTSE 100 blue-chip index has closed just 3 points higher at 5910 points, a new three-week high. That means the Footsie has jumped by almost 6% during US Election week, which is the best week since June. Mining stocks led the risers today, with Glencore jumping 3.5%, Rio Tinto up 2.8% and Anglo American gaining 2.7%. European stocks posted losses, though, with Germany\u2019s DAX down 0.7% and France\u2019s CAC losing 0.5%. But for the week, the Stoxx 600 also had its best week since June. Guy Foster, chief strategist at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, also suspects Wall Street is pricing in a split government. \u201cMarkets had a few days to get to grips with the fact that President-elect Biden was in prospect. They particularly like the fact that they can bid farewell to the chaos of Trump but without the higher taxes that a Democratic Senate might bring. The one risk that is perhaps being understated is that the Democrats may yet take the Senate once the Georgia run-offs have occurred in January.\u201d This week\u2019s strong rally shows that Wall Street is not alarmed by the prospect of a Biden presidency. But it may also reflect the possibility of political gridlock (all depending on the eventual outcome of the two Senate seat races in Georgia). Michael Strobaek, Global Chief Investment Officer at Credit Suisse, says that without a Blue Wave in Congress, higher corporate taxes or tighter reforms of energy and tech are less likely: A split government will limit the ability of the Biden administration to push through any major legislative change. This means that further fiscal stimulus is likely to be less generous than what the Democrats proposed. It also means that legislation that would be negative for equity markets in general (such as corporate tax hikes) or disruptive for individual sectors including pharmaceuticals, technology and energy is now less probable except where the president can act without congressional approval. The administration\u2019s stance on trade policy is likely to shift moderately, with tariff threats far lower, in particular against Europe. However, the tough stance on Chinese technology is likely to be maintained. In an initial reaction, stock markets rallied on the election outcome, indicating that market participants see the reduced likelihood of higher taxes and increased regulation as more important than the likely reduced stimulus. As Joe Biden moves closer to victory, here\u2019s a chart showing how Wall Street is enjoying its strongest weekly gains since April - with the S&amp;P 500 up 7% this week. The hollow candlesticks show gains, while the filled-in ones are losses. Last week was a rough one on Wall Street, the worst since March, as Covid-19 worries and election uncertainty hit stocks. But this week has seen equities bounce right back. Back in London, the FTSE 100 index has pushed higher. The blue-chip index is up 23 points or 0.4% at 5929, which would be its highest close in over three weeks. It\u2019s also posted strong gains this week - up over 6% since Monday morning, which would be the best week since June (and nearly the best since the April recovery....) The S&amp;P 500 index is also on track for its best week in month. This broad index of US listed companies has gained 7% this week - a very substantial rally - and its best weekly performance since April. Despite opening slightly lower today, the Dow Jones industrial average is still enjoying its best week in months. The Dow has surged by over 6.7% this week as the election race has unfolded. That would be the biggest weekly rise since the first week of June (when it gained 6.8%). If we get another rally today, the Dow would rack up the best week since April. Technology and healthcare stocks are leading the fallers; including Microsoft (-2.2%), Apple (-2.1%); UnitedHealth (-2.2%) and Salesforce.com (-1.8%). In New York, the US stock market has opened a little lower, as traders avidly watch the election race unfold. But it\u2019s a very muted drop so far, after a week of strong gains. Dow Jones industrial average: down 148 points or 0.5% at 28,241 S&amp;P 500: down 19 points or 0.55% at 3,490 Nasdaq: down 119 points or 1% at 11,771 The important news on the election front is that Joe Biden is now narrowly ahead in the counting in Pennsylvania. If he wins Pennsylvania, he\u2019d have another 20 electoral college votes - enough to pass the 270 threshold and win the presidential race. A timely reminder of the economic challenge ahead... Randy Frederick of Schwab says today\u2019s jobs report is better than expected, particularly the decline in the unemployment rate from 7.9% to 6.9%. Dr James Ingram, Investment Manager at MB Capital, is encouraged that the US economy created 638,000 new jobs last month -- although more would clearly have been better! In a week where the US presidential election has of course been the main focus, today\u2019s non-farm payroll announcement could have easily been overshadowed. Broadly in line with expectations and with the official unemployment rate dropping much more than expected this is a positive end to the week. Job creation is what everyone is looking for to build from the ground up within the current climate and this figure ticks that box. We would always happily see it higher but it is great to see the rate hasn\u2019t slowed significantly from the previous month. Glassdoor\u2019s senior economist Daniel Zhao says the report is encouraging, but a full recovery is many months away. \u201cAs the nation remains engrossed with the ongoing U.S. election, today\u2019s October jobs report shows the economic recovery chugged along undeterred. The report was a positive one for all of the right reasons. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.9% as Americans surged back into the labor force, while permanent layoffs remain unchanged at 3.7 million in a positive sign that permanent economic damage is not accumulating as quickly as feared. There\u2019s still a long road ahead, but the recovery continues to exceed expectations month-after-month. Today\u2019s report lends some optimism to a recovery that continues to make steady progress, but we are not out of the woods yet. The jobs report is a look back in time and doesn\u2019t fully incorporate the effects of the most recent wave of COVID-19 cases. The trajectory of the recovery is not set in stone, and resurgent headwinds could certainly derail progress. This puts responsibility in the hands of policymakers and the next president to manage both the health and economic crises.\u201d Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, says the US economy still needs a new stimulus package: \u201cAmidst of a week of election uncertainty, the US labour market delivered a robust jobs report, showing a slightly better than expected increase in payrolls and a meaningful drop in unemployment to below 7%. And yet, while this demonstrated solid progress in a gradual recovery, the pace of progress has slowed considerably in the last few months. This loss of momentum is set to continue, and we do not anticipate payroll employment returning to its pre-COVID level before the end of next year. \u201cEven if today\u2019s report was slightly stronger than expected, the need for additional fiscal stimulus is clear. The last 48 hours appear to have reduced the chances of a large fiscal injection. Nonetheless, with large parts of the U.S. economy simply unable to get back to normal in the worsening pandemic, whoever ends up in the White House will eventually have to take notice of the calls for further support as they grow louder and more desperate.\u201d Unemployment rates declined among all major US worker groups in October, the BLS reports, but is notably higher for some groups than others: The rate was 6.7% for adult men, 6.5% for adult women, 13.9% for teenagers, 6.0% for Whites, 10.8% for Blacks, 7.6% for Asians, and 8.8% for Hispanics. My colleague Dominic Rushe wrote about the issue of racial economic inequality in the US last week, and how the pandemic has made the problem worse. Black and Latino people are overrepresented in the leisure and hospitality industries that were hardest hit by quarantine measures and continue to suffer as tourism and travel remain depressed. Only one in four Americans has a job that allows them to work from home, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And people of color represent the largest share of those whose jobs cannot be done from their kitchen tables. The number of Americans temporarily laid off fell by 1.4m last month, to 3.2m. That\u2019s down from 18.1m in April, but still 2.4 million higher than in February, the BLS says. However, there\u2019s less progress on those permanently unemployment, points out Jason Furman, who chaired Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers: The US nonfarm payroll employment total has now improved for six months in a row. But nonfarm employment is still 10.1 million jobs below its February level, the BLS points out. This tweet from Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics shows how the US employment total plunged by twenty million jobs in April, and how much lost ground still needs making up: The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the US private sector created 906,000 new jobs last month. Government jobs fell by 268,000, though, partly due to the loss of 147,000 temporary 2020 Census workers. This meant the overall Non-Farm Payroll rose by 638,000. The BLS says: These improvements in the labor market reflect the continued resumption of economic activity that had been curtailed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and efforts to contain it. In October, notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, retail trade, and construction. Employment in government declined. September\u2019s non-farm Payroll has been revised higher. It shows the US economy created 672,000 new jobs in September, up from 661,000 previously. The US economy created 638,000 new jobs last month, more than the 600,000 expected. And the US unemployment rate has fallen to 6.9% in October, down from 7.9% in September. That\u2019s a much decline in the jobless rate than expected (economists forecast a dip to 7.7%). Another encouraging sign: the US Labor Force Participation Rate has risen to 61.7%, up from 61.4% in September, showing more people were in work or looking for work. It may show that the US labor market had recovered faster than expected. European stocks are still subdued, as we await the US jobs report in around 15 minutes. FTSE 100: down 14 points or 0.25% at 5891 German DAX: down 150 points or 1.2% at 12,417 French CAC: down 50 points or 1% at 4,933 Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: The most probable outcome still looks like a Democrat win with Joe Biden winning the Presidency, however nagging doubts remain that the eventual outcome may well end up in the US courts. For now, financial markets don\u2019t appear too concerned about that this, however it would still seem prudent to take some money off the table as we head into the weekend, and today\u2019s US payrolls report. Kevin Boscher, chief investment officer at Ravenscroft, has predicted that Washington will agree a stimulus package once the election is done and dusted. However, it probably won\u2019t match the $3trn deal that the Democrats pushed for, unsuccessfully, this year. Boscher reckons the most likely scenario is a narrow win for Joe Biden but with the Republicans retaining control of the Senate [not yet certain] and making some modest gains in the House. A split Senate would give Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote, but still leave challenges, he writes... Biden\u2019s legislative agenda will be at the mercy of either the majority Republican Senate or their blocking filibuster tactic if they fail to win the majority. Other more moderate Democrats could also spoil the party. Hence, it is much less likely that Biden will be able to pursue his more progressive \u201cgreen\u201d infrastructure stimulus deal. It will also be much more difficult to pass many of his other favourite initiatives, including the proposed tax increases, changes to healthcare and increased regulation. Biden would need to try to negotiate with the Republicans via the budget reconciliation process and using his executive powers. Alternatively, he might need to move to outlaw the filibuster tactic, although this would probably be met with resistance and traditional Democrats in the Senate appear reluctant to change the rules. Despite the uncertainty, I believe there is a good chance that a new fiscal package will be agreed before Inauguration Day next January, although the size of any deal is likely to be considerably smaller than the Democrats would like. Back in the foreign exchange markets, the US dollar has dipped against a basket of other currencies so far today. That adds to this week\u2019s earlier losses, sending the greenback towards two-year lows. As the US dollar is a safe-haven, this suggests the markets are not panicking about the political situation in America. Lee Hardman, currency expert at Japan\u2019s MUFG bank, explains: The US dollar has weakened across the board over the past week in anticipation of Joe Biden becoming the President. The Australian dollar (+3.4% vs. USD), Norwegian krone (+3.3%) and New Zealand dollar (2.6%) have been the best performing G10 currencies that have benefited from the improvement in risk sentiment as global equity markets have rebounded. Traders may also be pricing in the prospect that US monetary policy remains extremely loose for some time. Yesterday, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell that the US economy needs more support. Ideally, that would come from the fiscal side - through a sizeable Covid-19 stimulus package that couldn\u2019t be agreed before the election. But if that can\u2019t happen (and a lot depends on those Senate races), then the burden will fall on the Fed. Here\u2019s an idea to ponder while we wait for US election results - should government bonds be linked to economic performance? Government borrowing is a hot issue in the UK right now. The cost of the pandemic has meant record monthly borrowing, with economists predicting that the new England lockdown - and the extension of the furlough scheme - could mean a deficit of \u00a3400bn this year, more than twice the previous record. UK borrowing costs are currently at record lows, helped by the Bank of England\u2019s QE scheme (expanded again yesterday). But some politicians are concerned about the long-term debt burden, while others fear that tightening fiscal policy (higher taxes, or lower spending) will derail growth and make the situation worse. Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University suggests a solution - link the interest rate paid to investors holding government debt to economic performance. He writes: The International Monetary Fund predicts that the UK\u2019s budget deficit will jump from 2.2% of GDP in 2019 to 16.5% of GDP in 2020 whereas its gross debt will jump from 85.3% of GDP in 2019 to 108% in 2020. This borrowing will have to be paid back in the future. To raise the money, Sunak will have to increase taxes and/or cut public expenditure in the not-so-distant future. Which brings into the picture the urgent need for government bonds to be linked to GDP. The idea here is that the interest due on GDP-linked bonds would go up or down depending on the issuing country\u2019s economic performance. When GDP growth is weak, its debt-servicing costs will decline. The ratio of its debt to GDP will therefore rise less sharply during a downturn, thus reducing the need for austerity to bring down the debt pile later. On the other hand, when GDP growth is strong and tax revenues are on the rise, the debt-servicing costs will increase. In other words, the UK would have to pay more when it could afford it, and significantly less when it could not. In fact, recent research at the Bank of England suggests that yields on these hypothetical bonds would be lower than those on conventional US bonds. Needless to say, once many countries issue these bonds, these can become part of a well-diversified portfolio which will allow investors to share risk and benefit from growth. Here\u2019s the full piece: With a W-shaped recession looming and debt piling up, the government should start issuing GDP-linked bonds The possibility that control of the US Senate might not be clear until January is also keeping investors on edge today. As flagged earlier, there\u2019s a chance that Georgia could host two Senate runoffs votes early next year. One is certain, while the second depends if Republican David Perdue can hit the 50% threshold for victory in a multi-candidate battle. If both races did go to runoffs \u2013 and Democrats were to win them \u2013 it would leave the Senate split 50-50 [assuming that the Republicans held the other two outstanding seats, in North Carolina and Alaska, as seems probable]. If the Senate is tied, then the vice-president has the casting vote. So this is very significant for the markets. Investors had been anticipating gridlock - meaning less chance of a really meaningful stimulus package. However, if the Democrats controlled the Senate and the White House, then a multi-trillion dollar Covid-19 aid package becomes more likely -- with a knock-on impact on borrowing, future growth prospects, unemployment, household spending, etc, It also has implications for tax reforms, and tighter regulation of tech companies. Here\u2019s the FT\u2019s take: The tight race for the US Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, was pivotal to the investment outlook, investors said. Fading expectations that Democrats would be able to take control of the upper house of Congress triggered a sharp rally in US government bonds this week but the outcome has become murkier in the days following Tuesday\u2019s election. Democrats are projected to maintain control of the House of Representatives. The Senate race \u201cis of utmost importance for US bond markets because political gridlock may stand in the way of a powerful fiscal stimulus\u201d, said analysts at UniCredit, who said a Democratic clean sweep would have led to the approval of a large stimulus package. \u201cThere is the possibility that we will see two run-offs in Georgia on January 5, which would leave bond markets guessing and might dampen directional momentum for several weeks,\u201d the analysts added. The US stock market is currently on track to open a little lower, with investors awaiting the latest Non-Farm Payroll jobs report as well as election news. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 0.5% in the futures market, with the S&amp;P 500 dipping 0.66% and the tech-focused Nasdaq on track for a 1% decline But trading doesn\u2019t begin for more than three hours, so this could change. And it follows a strong rally of around 2% yesterday, as Joe Biden moved narrowly ahead in the presidential race. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are \u2018consolidating\u2019 this week\u2019s gains. Votes continue to be counted in a number of key battleground states and whilst Donald Trump is pursuing legal avenues, his chances of getting anywhere appear slim. So far courts have thrown out his appeals. Moreover, Joe Biden is closing the gap in those states still counting and these last bastions of hope for the President could also flip. The oil price has also dropped today. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is down 2.5% at $39.89 per barrel - moving back towards the four-month lows seen at the end of October. But as you can see here, oil had rallied sharply since the start of the week: US election jitters, and anxiety over the Covid-19 pandemic, are weighing on the oil market today, reports Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at axi. Oil is down due to lingering election uncertainty, and continued worries about spiking coronavirus infections in the US and Europe weigh on sentiment. But, the possibility of the Opec group extending their current supply cuts for longer is providing some support, Innes adds. The new lockdowns in several European countries are bound to hit energy demand - as shown by easyJet\u2019s latest flight cuts. European stock markets are dropping a little lower now, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 now down 43 points or 0.7% today (but still up strongly since Monday). After a very strong week, the strong post-election rally does seem to be fading... just as Joe Biden takes the lead in Georgia as the counting continues. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, suggests there is some \u2018end of the week profit-taking\u2019, as investors look ahead: Firstly, the results of the presidential election are yet to be finalised and are likely to be disputed. Secondly, there is a real risk that a divided Congress will argue for too long about a new relief package that has already been delayed since July. Meanwhile in the UK, house prices have hit a new record level. Halifax reports that prices have risen by 7.5% in the last 12 months - the fastest house price inflation in over four years. The average property now costs \u00a3250,457, according to Halifax\u2019s data. Here\u2019s the details: On a monthly basis, house prices in October were 0.3% higher than in September In the latest quarter (August to October) house prices were 4.0% higher than in the preceding three months (May to July) House prices in October were 7.5% higher than in the same month a year earlier \u2013 the strongest growth since June 2016 Quite astonishing in some ways, given Britain plunged into a steep recession this year, with Covid-19 restrictions hitting the economy and pushing up unemployment. The current stamp duty holiday is one factor. Some families have also been looking for larger properties after many months of home working. Russell Galley, Managing Director at Halifax, cautions that \u2018headwinds\u2019 will put downward pressure on prices in the coming months. \u201cWhile Government support measures have undoubtedly helped to delay the expected downturn in the housing market, they will not continue indefinitely and, as we move through autumn and into winter, the macroeconomic landscape in the UK remains highly uncertain. Though the renewed lockdown is set to be less restrictive than earlier this year, it bears out that the country\u2019s struggle with COVID-19 is far from over. With a number of clear headwinds facing the housing market, we expect to see greater downward pressure on house prices as we move into 2021.\u201d The Covid-19 pandemic continues to hit the airline industry hard, with easyJet scaling back its flight plans yet again. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff explains: EasyJet is cutting its flight schedule further after the introduction of new lockdown measures in the UK and mainland Europe, saying it will only run a maximum of 20% of planned flights for the rest of the year. The airline said it was scaling back only days after the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced fresh Covid-19 restrictions that ban residents in England from holidaying abroad or within the UK until 2 December. EasyJet said similar lockdown measures in Germany and France were also affecting flight plans. The airline\u2019s financial year begins in October and it said: \u201cEasyJet now expects to fly no more than 20% of planned capacity for the first quarter. The battle for the US Senate also took another twist last night, as my colleague Daniel Strauss explains: Democratic hopes of wrenching control of the Senate from Republicans received an unexpected boost as it seems likely that two key races in the southern state of Georgia may be headed to runoff races. One of the races is definitely headed to a second round in January, while a second Georgia contest and races in North Carolina and Alaska remain undecided, leaving the chamber now deadlocked 48-48. An outcome may now not be known until the new year. Republicans look likely to win in North Carolina and Alaska, but Democrats would undoubtedly focus huge amounts of energy and money on trying to win the Georgia runoffs. If both races did go to runoffs \u2013 and Democrats were to win them \u2013 it would leave the Senate split 50-50, with the vice-president serving as a tie-breaker. If Joe Biden is in the White House, that would mean a vice-president Kamala Harris would be the deciding vote in the Senate. If Donald Trump wins a second term, then it would be Mike Pence, the current vice-president. This uncertainty may weigh on markets today too. European stock markets have dipped into the red this morning, after strong gains earlier in the week. The FTSE 100 index is down 18 points, or 0.3%, at 5887 - which still leaves it up over 5.5% this week. John J Hardy of Saxo Bank says markets are \u2018easing back\u2019 after this week\u2019s surges: As the final votes are being tallied in the U.S. election, the accumulation of mail-in votes looks set to send Biden over the top, although President Trump is crying foul and has declared himself the winner. The Fed kept a very low profile at its meeting last night and markets are easing back after the blistering rally in nearly everything over the last two sessions..... The fight is getting ugly, but courts seem to be largely rejecting the flurry of attempts that President Trump\u2019s team is making to stop vote counts in various jurisdictions. The counts should be sufficiently clear ahead of the weekend for Biden to declare himself the winner, but will Trump concede? It\u2019s been a long road for Japanese investors. The Nikkei peaked in December 1989 at over 38,000 points, before the 80s asset-inflated bubble economy went spectacularly sour. The resulting crash, stagnation and deflation sent share prices tumbling - the Nikkei sunk towards 7,000 points after 2008 financial crisis. The recent move towards Abenomics -- fiscal spending, ultraloose monetary policy and structural reforms -- have seen stocks move higher. But as we wrote last December, former PM Shinzo Abe\u2019s third arrow struggled to hit its target. Abe has encouraged more women to enter the workforce and relaxed immigration laws to allow a modest number of blue-collar workers to fill gaps in pressurised sectors of the economy. But much needed reform of the labour market, corporate governance and healthcare have been slow to materialise. The Nikkei\u2019s jump to a 29-year closing high didn\u2019t disguise some nervousness in the markets today. As Reuters puts it: While the election outcome hinged on a dwindling set of uncounted votes in a handful of battleground states, Biden maintained an edge over Trump. But uncertainty still loomed as the Republican incumbent mounts legal challenges to vote counts. \u201cThe outcome of the election has not been confirmed... It is necessary to take a cautious stance from here on,\u201d Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management said. More here: Nikkei closes at near 3-decade high as Biden edges closer to win The election rally has driven Japan\u2019s benchmark stock index to a near thirty-year closing high today. The Nikkei jumped 0.9% today to 24,325 points, which is its highest closing point since 1991 - when Japan\u2019s asset price bubble was bursting. Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, said: \u201cEquity prices are tracking U.S. stocks higher amid a slight euphoria in the market that Biden is almost certain to win the presidential election.\u201d Reuters points out that one factor behind this week\u2019s rally is the prospect of gridlock in U.S. Congress. If Joe Biden becomes US president, but the Republicans maintain control of the Senate, then it may be hard to push major policy changes through. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After days of high electoral drama, global stock markets are on track for their best week in months. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has surged by 6% since Monday morning - the strongest rise since June - as shares recover from last week slump. In New York, the US Dow Jones industrial average has already gained 7%, which would be the biggest weekly rise since April. But there\u2019s still a day to go until the weekend. And there\u2019s an edgy feel in the markets today, as Joe Biden continues to narrow the gap on Donald Trump in two key states - Georgia and Pennsylvania. As things stand, Biden is trailing by about 1,700 votes in Georgia, and 22,500 in Pennsylvania as the mail-in ballots (which have largely favoured the Democrats) continue to be counted. While Biden edges closer to the White House, the current president delivered a quite shocking series of falsehoods last night - wrongly claiming that \u201cillegal votes\u201d were being used to \u201csteal\u201d the election. CNN\u2019s fact check called it the most dishonest speech of his presidency. The prospects of a protracted and fraught battle in the days, or even weeks, ahead could send a few shivers through trading floors. So after days of strong gains, investors may be a little more cautious today while the drama plays out. Fiona Cincotta of Gain Capital sums up the situation: European markets see a weaker start after a strong post-election bounce. The final result of the US Presidential election has yet to be announced although Joe Biden has extended his lead and Trump\u2019s legal challenge to stop counting in Michigan and Georgia has been thrown out. The markets are still leaning towards Biden win together with a split Congress Normally, today would be dominated by the latest US unemployment data. October\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show a fall in job creation, down to 600k from 661k in September. A weak reading would bolster concerns that America\u2019s recovery is slowing, and in need of new fiscal stimulus from Congress. But that will have to wait until the election drama has played out. We\u2019re also expecting new house price data that will show whether Britain\u2019s property market is still booming, or if the slowing economy and Covid-19 lockdowns are denting demand.
