And 30 years is really quite a remarkable run. Especially for an idea as crazy as this.\u201d In terrarum orbe unicum \u2013 unique in the world \u2013 for most of its unexpectedly long life, Nuntii Latini was a five-minute review of world events, broadcast every Friday just after the main six o\u2019clock news, in Latin, from Finland. The Nordic nation has kept alive a noble tradition of classical studies, long considered an essential part of a sound humanist education. It also has its fair share of oddballs \u2013 some of whom are not averse to dabbling in Latin. Jukka Ammondt, a literature professor, found fame in the 1990s by recording an album of Elvis Presley\u2019s hits in Latin, including Ursus Taddeus, Glaudi Calcei and Menses Incertes (AKA Teddy Bear, Blue Suede Shoes and Suspicious Minds) and touring the US. Some linguists also believe Finns have a special affinity with Latin because its grammar and sounds are similar to Finnish, with words formed using prefixes and suffixes and a distinction made between long and short vowels. For whatever reason, Nuntii Latini was a hit, winning over a small but fiercely loyal audience with its four or five weekly items. It reported on world affairs from the death of Princess Diana and 9/11 to the Iraq war and the 2008 financial crisis, as well as major cultural and sporting events and Finnish news likely to be of interest to an international audience. \u201cIt was precious,\u201d said Christian Laes, a professor of ancient history at Manchester University, who along with other leading Latin academics led a global listeners\u2019 protest imploring the Finnish broadcaster Yle to save the show when it was first threatened with closure in 2017. \u201cIt showed people they were dealing with a real language, not some kind of riddle or puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cThat Latin really could be used for speaking. And it was a very clear Latin. Lots of listeners were surprised by how much they could understand.\u201d It was born, however, largely from a joke. In 1989, recalled Meril\u00e4inen, a legendary Finnish television and radio presenter, Hannu Taanila, had been invited to give a speech to a wine society in the northern Finnish town of Rovaniemi in the Arctic Circle. \u201cHe toyed first with the idea of delivering it in French: this was a wine society, after all,\u201d Meril\u00e4inen said. \u201cThen his wife suggested he try Latin, so Taanila asked a Latinist to translate his speech. It was a catastrophe, of course: he couldn\u2019t speak Latin. But afterwards he said: could we do the news in Latin? And the Latinist said yes.\u201d Reijo Pitk\u00e4ranta, a lecturer in Latin at Helsinki University, would go on, with the help of two other eminent Latinists, Tuomo Pekkanen from Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 University and Virpi Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4-Pekkanen, also from Helsinki University, to edit and translate the Nuntii Latini bulletin for the next 30 years. There was understandable scepticism in the Yle hierarchy in the early days, said Outi Kaltio, a colleague of Pitk\u00e4ranta who has read the news in the language of Cicero and Caesar for the past 15 years. \u201cBut quite soon they started to receive feedback, not just from Finland but abroad,\u201d Kaltio said. \u201cPeople around the world were writing in to say, this is so cool, this is really awesome. It gained a really committed audience.\u201d On the radio in Finland, the show was a familiar fixture, with a regular audience of 50,000 \u2013 not insignificant in a country of 5.5 million. On shortwave, it found keen listeners from Belgium to the US, China and Vietnam, with more joining in later years as it became available on Yle\u2019s website. At home and abroad, many listeners were simply lovers of language, not Latin students or teachers at all. \u201cLots of people have studied a little Latin in school,\u201d Kaltio said. \u201cBut others just like languages, and are interested. It\u2019s fun and rewarding to see what you can understand, to recognise Donald Trump or Theresa May in Latin.\u201d A 2017 petition to postpone the show\u2019s planned closure until its 30th anniversary last week gathered 3,200 signatures from 50 countries. One listener in Thailand told Yle that Nuntii Latini \u201ctaught us the lesson of being a citizen of the world, of caring about our past, where we come from\u201d. Another spoke of \u201cthe unique perspective brought to global issues by expressing them in Latin\u201d. For teachers and students, it was a boon. Latin these days is taught through grammar and reading, said Kaltio, not listening and speaking, and Nuntii Latini offered \u201ca vital auditory dimension\u201d. For Laes, although he said Latin has never been a dead language, the show was a constant reminder of how alive it was. The show\u2019s three founding academics did not invent new words, relying on classical Latin\u2019s 92,502-word vocabulary and subsequent medieval and other additions. Instead, said Laes, they built new combinations from old: acta diurna is a newspaper, aeroplanum an airplane, interete the internet, and cursus electronicus an email. With selected vocabulary published on the programme\u2019s website, the result was a Latin that was pure, but also fresh and modern, which won plaudits from aficionados around the world and made a major contribution to the contemporary study of the language. When its time finally came, two of the programme\u2019s three core academics accepted Yle\u2019s argument that the broadcaster\u2019s limited resources must be focused on Finland, and that after 30 years Nuntii Latini really had to to make way for new programming. Pitk\u00e4ranta and his Helsinki colleagues would have liked it to continue. \u201cWe are very sad it has ended like this,\u201d said Kaltio. All the same, said Laes, the world owes a small but significant debt of gratitude to Finland\u2019s public broadcaster for keeping the show going for three decades. Nuntii Latini will be missed, he said, but he was \u201cnot afraid Latin will disappear. Far from it. We\u2019ve always had these worries, and it has always survived.\u201d The Vatican announced this month it was launching a weekly news bulletin in Latin \u2013 Hebdomada Papae, or the Pope\u2019s Week \u2013 Laes noted, as well as a half-hour Latin conversation programme. With a Latin version of Wikipedia available online along with more than 40 active Latin Facebook groups, and the German station Radio Bremen now also broadcasting news in Latin once a month, this particular \u201cdead language\u201d does not look in bad shape."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
