This year, the 21-year old Exeter University student helped to fly the aircraft which won the Malta Air Rally. His ambition now is to be an airline pilot in fulfilment of the dream he has held since boyhood. There is one obstacle in his way, however. To train as a commercial pilot, he will need between \u00a350,000 and \u00a370,000 to study for numerous practical and theoretical exams. Most students graduate from university with several thousand pounds of debt to clear in the first years of their working lives. But some end up owing astronomical sums, because their chosen career paths involve expensive study and training. Pilot-training is transparently costly, because aspiring aviators must train in real aircraft and jet simulators - both expensive. Anyone who yearns to take the floor as a leading barrister at the Old Bailey will also, not surprisingly, need a hefty stash of money or face incurring heavy debts. This is partly because law is taught by practising lawyers whose fees do not come cheap, and partly because of the cost of maintaining traditions and keeping up appearances - a wig and gown, for instance, cost about \u00a3550. Many would be surprised, though, to learn that the path to a career as a psychotherapist is also very expensive. Mark Brayne, a BBC World Service journalist, qualified as a psychotherapist two years ago and reckons his training cost \u00a320,000. A large chunk of this is incurred because would-be therapists must undergo 150 hours of psychotherapy themselves, at a cost of \u00a340-\u00a350 an hour. But the radio journalist is so convinced of the benefits of personal development, that he has started a small private practice and plans to devote more time to it. Mark is also director of the European branch of a global organisation, Dart, which aims to teach media organisations, journalists and others about the effects of covering traumatic events. So, what lies ahead for anyone who wants to follow these expensive career routes? Aspiring pilots must first learn to fly light aircraft by gaining the Private Pilot's Licence. This course involves a minimum of 45 hours of flying time, most spent with an instructor, and the cost varies according to where you learn to fly, from \u00a380 to \u00a3150 an hour. Books, maps and other navigation equipment can cost another \u00a3200 and the flight test at the end of the course costs around \u00a3150. \"Once the PPL has been completed, it's time to add more skills to what you already know,\" says Rupert Dyke. \"Night flying involves a minimum of five hours of training, the multi-engine rating takes at least 10, and the instrument training 15. \"The commercial pilot's licence is the big one and makes a huge dent in any bank balance. It can cost up to \u00a370,000 to train in the UK, but considerably less to train in the US. This is tempting for most pilots, but a pilot trained in the UK is considered the best of the best by airlines worldwide.\" Flight tests are gruelling and expensive, but once finished, a pilot can begin to earn money from flying. \"The problem is there are usually too many pilots and too few jobs,\" says Rupert. Even those who make the grade may not make big money. Although top pilots employed by major airlines earn between \u00a380,000 and \u00a3100,000 a year, the starting salary is around \u00a330,000 a year. A lucky, tiny minority of fledgling pilots are trained by an airline at no cost to themselves, either by learning to fly in the armed services or by being sponsored by an airline. Some airlines will select students for training based aptitude tests and a series of interviews, but the competition is ferocious. \"The problem is getting airlines to notice your application,\" says Rupert. \"They receive thousands each year and throw half of them away after one glance. A levels and a degree will make them look a bit harder. A levels, a degree and a Private Pilot's Licence will get them even more interested and if you can show that you are a keen aviator on paper as well you may receive that much wanted phone call. Determination is the key.\" The total cost of qualifying as a barrister meanwhile, is \"quite considerable\", the Bar Council admits, adding that \"prospective entrants to the profession are advised to investigate potential sources of funding available at each stage of qualification\". To qualify, there are four main stages: first you need a degree in law, or in any other subject alongside a special course which costs \u00a33,500-\u00a34,000; second, the Bar Vocational Course, which takes one year full-time or two years part-time. Students are then 'called to the bar'. The third stage is called Pupillage - one year spent in an authorised training organisation such as a barrister's chambers. Barristers are now subject to requirements known as \"continuing professional development\" in order to keep their practising certificates. This usually entails attending courses and lectures. Fees for the Bar Vocational Course are about \u00a37,000-\u00a39,750 and the 'call to the bar' fee is about \u00a380. \"All in all, qualifying as a barrister is a very expensive process and the big question is, where is the money to come from?\" the Bar Council advises on its training and education website, www.legaleducation.org.uk. Grants from local authorities are discretionary and are now rarely available to students doing the one-year conversion courses or those undertaking the vocational stage of training. There is some help available, though: the Bar Council Scholarship Trust provides interest-free loans of up to \u00a35,000 during pupillage and the Inns of Court give scholarships. The financial rewards after qualifying are large, though, with barristers able to charge many hundreds of pounds an hour for their time. Fees charged by psychotherapists are far humbler, at \u00a340-\u00a350 an hour, but the spiritual rewards are enormous, says Mark Brayne.\" Psychotherapists first take a certificate in listening skills, which takes a year,\" he says. Then you need to study for between two and four years for a diploma. \"Counselling is relatively basic and tends to be carried out on a voluntary basis,\" Mark adds. \"Psychotherapy embraces counselling but involves a much more profound journey of personal development. I find it an extraordinary privilege to be allowed to accompany other human beings on this journey. At some level, you really have to have lived and to have faced suffering to be a successful psychotherapist.\" Mark says he has encountered much suffering during his years as a Reuter and BBC correspondent based in China, Romania, and in reporting from the opening years of the Balkan conflicts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
