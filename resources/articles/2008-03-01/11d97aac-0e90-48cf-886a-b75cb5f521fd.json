Or disappears up its own fundament, depending on the quality of publication you read. That's right, this week on Watch With.., the weekly feature in which we view, review, dissect, reflect and generally 'watch' an hour of British television. This week, we'll be re/viewing Rock Rivals on ITV1 from 9-10pm. If you're around, join us! If you're watching it, comment simultaneously and experience the full joy of typing while watching television. Watched it earlier and reading this in retorspect? Tell us what you thought. We want to know. More than that, we NEED to know. Although we have been told off for being overly nasty about ITV1's other latest contemporary drama effort - coincidentally also self-referential, cocking a snook at the television world - and so I am determined to be positive and nice about this show tonight. I've not seen it, or, in fact, any trailers for it. But I am determined, as a fan of the medium, a fan of new drama and a supporter of British television writers, I am determined to find the good in this, this television about television, this brave new world of reality turned drama (with added dramatic reality) tonight. Or something. Bring it on. It's Happy Watch This!... (TM, one week only) (or as long as it lasts) 8.59: It's Wednesday night, we're exactly three buttons through the full world of buttons, and we're looking forward to this, the true marriage between reality and drama. According to the interview with Michelle Collins on the ITV press website - Michelle who will, let's not forget, be appearing any moment now as Karina Faith - \"It's very now\". And I can't think of a more honest endorsement than that. Ooooh, it's starting! 9.03: And so it begins! A racy title sequence, and, as Jason promised earlier in the day, a car in a swimming pool. The camera lingers long on the car, being, as it is, incongruously in a swimming pool. As exciting music plays, we circle the swimming pool. Which has a car in it. I could watch this all evening. But I don't have to! Because next to the pool is a laptop, and on the laptop, we're watching television. It's a talent show. Rock Rivals! 9.07: Behind the judges desk, a curly-topped Michelle Collins, a Cowellesque man, and, quite possibly someone else we have not seen yet. There is the usual drama of pauses, and people getting thrown off the show (though let us not get too invested or overly upset, it is not a REAL reality show, remember) and a typically nasty comment as the Cowellalike - Mal Faith, I believe he is called, married to the dishmoplike Michelle Collins - man calls the winning contestant \"a lump\". A chubby blind guy, having been booted, sings a tearful rendition of 'Wind Beneath My Wings\", and we get to see some backstage action. Which is quite exciting, because it's just like watching the X Factor, except in 3D, isn't it! Kind of? Um. Yeah! 9.14: It's all rumbuctious filthiness and the kind of playful music of ascending scales on the 'strings' setting of a casio keyboard that suggests people with arched eyebrows nudging the viewer in the ribs and going \"Eh? EH? Did you notice that? Did you? You'll need to come back to that later, eh? Because it's clever, do you see? D'you?\" A quick catch up: - There is a strange man watching the talent show at home with a sex doll with one of the (male) contestant's faces stuck to it - or rather, a picture, not his actual face. - Mal Faith, the Cowellalike judge married to Karina, the Mopalike Collins, is having an affair with his PA. And his wife has just found out. 9.22: Mal, whose name I'm afraid I cannot use seriously, as I'm not clear about it being a real name, has so far given an unpeppy-peptalk to the cute little contestants of the in-show talent show - one of whom is wearing a simply smashing green dress, three cheers for the wardrobe department, there - he's been kicked in the balls by his wife Michelle Collins, which will have hurt, as she is a dishmop, and her foot, like the rest of her, is made of solid pine. She's very cross with him, but appears to have had some work done on her teeth because they're looking really lovely. 9.28: The second string storyline is the 'lumpy' contestant who just scraped through the in-drama reality show, but isn't dealing with the 'lump' thing awfully well. Having first attacked herself half-heartedly with a spoon or something on ITV2 - which is funny, because I always try and attack things with spoons when I discover I'm on ITV2, too (but, um, in a good way?) she's now flounced out of the group contestant's mansion, gone home with her delightfully ropey old mum, and is sitting on the edge of her bed drinking nail varnish to a background of the same racy-bouncy music. nudge nudge! Eh? Eh?! 9.35: Excuse my slowness - please put it down to technical problems rather than my getting too wrapped up in the drama, though of course if I wasn't experiencing technical problems I would be getting overly wrapped up in the drama, as it is terribly absorbing etc. While drunk, Mal has inadvertently filed for divorce, and, waking up the next morning, rushing to find Karina and try and make it all up to her, he finds her reading the divorce papers already. Whoever his solicitors are, I hope they advertise them at some point during the show, as they're clearly terribly good value for money. What do you mean the solicitors aren't real? Some of it is real, right? Like the reality show? Because people are going to get to vote on that in the end, aren't they? So it must be real. Interactive drama. Boy, it's like the heady days of Choose Your Own Adventure books all over again, isn't it? But with more nipples. Speaking of nipples, we've just been spared a pair, as Mal's bit on the side climbed out fo the pool clamping them in her tiny hands. Soon after, that car we heard so much about earlier was removed from the garage and deposited in the aforementioned pool. It belonged to Mal, then. Hands up who didn't see that coming! And that's what's great about this kind of comedy drama, you see, it is predictable yet absorbant, like the conservative party, or toilet paper. No, sorry, I was trying to think of something eminently positive to say, and just came out with gibberish instead. They're so closely related, don't you find? 9.50: It's nowhere yet finished, and yet I feel really full. Really 'can't eat another bite' full. We've had notion that the contestant called a lump might actually be dead. There are two contestants who, having signed a contract vowing not to have boyfriends or girlfriends, are talking of getting married. One of them, Luke, has just met his crazy stalker fan, though he doesn't know it yet. The Mal/Faith divorce is shaping up to be acrimonious. There's a boy band who are pointlessly bitchy and inter-competitive. A LouisWalshalike judge has no character traits at all yet, apart from being orange, so pleasantly true to life there, then. I feel like I've been handed a large serving bowl filled with trifle and told I'm to eat every single bite before I can leave the room. And I'm only down to the jelly layer, and I already feel sick. 9.55: The Nail Varnish drinking contestant, Bethany, is not dead after all!!! So there's something we've all learnt - drinking nail varnish = not that bad for you after all! Please don't act on that at home, people. Be safe. Anyway, so, Faith went to see Bethany, after us seeing a cutaway scene of the young lumpy woman bellowing 'One Moment In Time' and told her that she wants her to win Rock Rivals. Mal, arriving in a hellychopper and apparently trying to win an award for Cowell impersonator of the year tells Luke that he wants HIM to win Rock Rivals. So there we have it. Yes, the audience will get to vote on the ending to this show; they'll get to choose between Luke and Bethany. That being quite so obviously the final choice, you'd have thought they might have started the voting now to get as much time in there and bump up those ITV profits a little (oooh, little bit of politics there, little bit of topical humour, ladeez and gents, let it never be said that I don't read the media headlines on the side there...) And then it is over. Trailer for next week, blah blah blah. Now, we could easily note what we have LEARNT from this hour of television, as is the general convention at the end of this feature, but, having been made to feel quite so terrible about being mean last time ITV premiered a new drama serial and we blogged it, we're instead this week going to ask: \"What Have We Loved?\" Back in a minute with that... What have we loved about tonight's drama premiere on ITV1, Rock Rivals? 1) It has a pleasantly alliterative name. Lots of 'r' words together are always like a cat purring or a tiny motorbike, don't you think? Rrrrrrrr. 2) It was, as you would expect the Footballers Wives/Bad Girls successor to be, shiny, glitzy trash, and had some pace to it. You imagine that once it thins down on characters a little, or makes you care more about some of the ones it's already introduced, it might be a right rollicking rollercoaster of sexy fun. Or was that the press release? Well whatever, it might. 3) That green dress that one of the contestants was wearing was quite nice. 4) People who liked Footballer's Wives might like this, as might people who like X Factor. Although one is better written and the other more dramatic. Not saying which. 5) The new Joss Stone adverts are quite annoying, but do inspire one to hope for other irritating recording artists remaking classic advertising campaigns. James Blunt as the Milk Tray man, anyone? Doing his own stunts, obv. 6: We will wait and see, it might, if I can get past the jelly layer without being sick into the waste paper basket, turn out to be a veritable hit. Either way, it's great to see new drama being placed prominently in the schedules. 7: Seeing as we're being so nice and supportive, can we have more new drama, but really well written with better actors next time pls? K thnx. And that's it. It was, well, alright. But trying to be upbeat's a pain in the arse, so I probably won't remember it fondly, sadly. If anyone's around, I'll be liveblogging Crufts Best In Show from 7-9 on Sunday night, which will be really quite similar, I imagine, but lots more fun - that'll be over on the News blog, though, what with it being a news event and that. In the meantime, thank you, and goodnight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
