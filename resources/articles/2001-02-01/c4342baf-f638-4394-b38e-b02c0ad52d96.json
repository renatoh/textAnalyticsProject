Bates's fellow FA board members stopped short of a no-confidence vote during their meeting in London but made clear their anger at swingeing criticisms last week in his open letter of resignation from the Wembley stadium project. Bates was critical of the FA's involvement in the project, alleging among other things that the governing body had undermined him and that no one from the board of either the FA or Wembley National Stadium Limited had publicly defended him or the project. \"Unanimously [the board] refuted the allegations made against WNSL and FA board members and senior FA executives by Mr Bates last week,\" the FA said in a statement. \"They expressed their total support for the individuals attacked in public in letters of resignation and in newspaper articles. These matters will be discussed with him in person on his return from holiday.\" The board is understood to have spent around an hour at its regular monthly meeting discussing Bates's comments. Although it could have proposed a no-confidence vote it could not have forced Bates out. As one of the board's four Premier League representatives he would have to be deselected by the league at its AGM in June, when his membership comes up for renewal. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
