Some of the interest in the race was lost when Silver Seeker, who would have been David Loder's first juvenile runner of the campaign, was withdrawn because the ground was on the soft side. Michael Jarvis trains the winner for Sheikh Ahmed Al Maktoum, and the former said: \"I will need to speak to his owner, but he is a possibility for Royal Ascot and the Coventry would be his race if he goes there. \"He has not been hard trained but he has come to himself in the last two weeks and he is a horse which will improve for that (the outing) - and this is the second of the four two-year-olds we have run to have won, and another was beaten a short head.\" Highest had to work a fair bit harder than might have been expected and only beat Champion Lion half a length in the Levy Board Maiden Stakes. Harry Herbert, manager of Highclere Thoroughbred Racing, said: \"Kieren Fallon was very pleased with the horse, but the rest of us nearly had a bit of a heart attack. \"He is still a big baby but he is very nice and improving all the time. We will have to see what the handicapper does, but we may think about Royal Ascot and the King George V Handicap which Beekeeper won for us last year.\" Purple Haze blotted her copybook last time at Newbury, but she was on good behaviour this time and won the Sponsorship Raceday Event Conditions Stakes in convincing fashion under Eddie Ahern. Winning trainer Gerard Butler said: \"To say we were disappointed last time would be an understatement. We had to get the preliminaries right with her today. She went to post early and we let her bowl along.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
