Well, we\u2019re not laughing now, are we? On the day before the hottest day of the year so far (temperatures at Glastonbury hit 30C, elsewhere in the UK 35C), Crow knocks out hit after hit on the Pyramid stage under a giant globe, Glastonbury\u2019s reminder that we\u2019ve only got one planet, and dedicates Soak Up the Sun to Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist and school striker. Thunberg\u2019s spirit is embedded in Worthy Farm this year. There are murals of her face with the slogan: \u201cWhat would Greta do?\u201d But another environmental legend makes it in person. David Attenborough, a surprise addition, comes out to enormous cheers from the massive crowd in front of the Pyramid stage \u2013 possibly the loudest of the entire festival. Giving a shoutout to Glastonbury for going plastic-free, he then introduces a little treat \u2013 a trailer for his next show, One Planet: Seven Worlds. This year\u2019s festival has been sold as Glastonbury\u2019s greenest ever. As Attenborough mentions, there has been a much-publicised ban on single-use plastic on site (although actually this is just a ban on vendors giving out single-use plastic; punters are allowed to bring in plastic bottles, but encouraged to reuse them at 850 refill points). At the last festival, in 2017, visitors used 1.3m plastic bottles, and the clean-up operation cost almost \u00a3800,000 and took six weeks \u2013 despite perennial pleas from Emily and Michael Eavis to \u201cLove Worthy Farm, Leave No Trace\u201d. Festivalgoers have been informed that leaving tent pegs in the ground could result in cows eating them and dying. Despite the 15,000 colour-coded bins, the site is still a sea of detritus. But nobody I speak to admits to having discarded, say, the Calvin Klein underpants I spot on the ground while queueing for ice-cream. (The ice-cream vans, of course, idle all day long, exhaust fumes mixing with the dust kicked up by thousands of marching feet. A lot of the stewards pair their fluorescent jackets with face masks.) There is excitement around Extinction Rebellion\u2019s appearance on the Park stage on Thursday. Friends Harry Hayward and Minnie Bartley (both 22) and Joe Holley (23) are sitting in the park eating pizza, Harry in a multi-coloured umbrella hat (\u201cIt\u2019s quite sweaty\u201d). It\u2019s their first time at Glastonbury. They want to talk about environmentalism and politics (it has been noted that more people yelled: \u201cfuck the government and fuck Boris\u201d at Stormzy\u2019s Saturday headline set than will actually be able to vote for Johnson to be prime minister, while Zac Goldsmith was booed at his own event). \u201cIt\u2019s definitely good that Glastonbury is pushing the green agenda. I\u2019ve been on the last two out of three Extinction Rebellion marches in Leeds,\u201d says Harry. \u201cBut we need to do something about this Tory government. Some of the reaction [to the climate demonstrations, to Thunberg\u2019s parliamentary address] has been really negative.\u201d Minnie has noticed an increase in people caring. \u201cEven in a year, with things like plastic straws. Every little helps.\u201d But Joe outlines the wider problem when he says that, in preparation for Glastonbury, he bought a reusable water bottle from Amazon, \u201cand it came in so much packaging, loads of it\u201d. The Extinction Rebellion set features Kurukindi, a Kichwa Amazonian shaman. Many in the crowd (some dressed in bee headdresses, or holding placards painted with whales) are visibly moved by his performance. Speeches by Extinction Rebellion\u2019s co-founder, Gail Bradbrook, and Greenpeace\u2019s Rosie Rogers follow. A huge cheer erupts when Rogers calls the MP Mark Field, who grabbed a Greenpeace protester by the back of the neck before marching her out, a \u201cscumbag\u201d. \u201cThe only thing we were armed with were leaflets and peer-reviewed science.\u201d A procession to the stone circle, ending in people forming a giant human hourglass (because time is running out), is fairly shambolic, but Extinction Rebellion\u2019s pastel pink boat \u2013 the one that hosted Emma Thompson in Oxford Circus, and is named after Berta C\u00e1ceres, the late Honduran activist \u2013 is even prettier in the flesh. At the Extinction Rebellion base in the Green Fields, Clarissa Carlyon, who has been volunteering with the group since October 2018 and was heavily involved in planning the April occupation, says Glastonbury has been really accommodating to the group. But is it enough, I ask. And doesn\u2019t she think other festivals have been way ahead of the curve? Mandala festival in the Netherlands, or Shambala in Northamptonshire, for instance, which is powered by 100% renewable energy and doesn\u2019t allow Coca-Cola and Nestl\u00e9 products to be sold on site. \u201cI think it\u2019s really tough when you have something the size and scale of Glastonbury,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they have given us this space, and other spaces, and we\u2019ve got videos playing around. It is great that the festival is embracing what we\u2019re talking about. I do feel it is seeping into the DNA of the place.\u201d Glastonbury has long been conscious of its footprint. The reusable 80% recycled stainless steel cups sold on site for a fiver were originally produced in 2016 as a way to help support the besieged British steel industry. (Although I watch loads of people being served their drinks in cardboard cups even when they proffer their steel cup, and the cardboard cups do not always end up in the correct bins.) It is also customary that any tents left behind are repurposed. In 2016, a charity called Aid Box Convoy collected abandoned tents and sent them to refugee camps in Europe. (But it is estimated that 90% of tents left at festivals end up as landfill.) At a Leftfield event called How to Save Our Planet, the Labour MP Clive Lewis and Minnie Rahman, from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, point out that climate justice intersects with social, racial and class justice. Rahman says: \u201cWhite people are overwhelmingly represented in the climate movement. I\u2019d really like to see the movement taking forward the connection that climate change doesn\u2019t affect us all equally. We see people in the global south, for instance, dying to protect their land, or the health impacts in parts of Britain because of air pollution.\u201d A panel by gal-dem makes similar points in their own discussions. The Leftfield tent is rammed. Although a few brims of straw hats are sliding down noses in the midday heat, the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas is afforded a rock-star welcome and a huge cheer goes up when she mentions Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Lucas\u2019s reference to the Green New Deal, a private member\u2019s bill she has tabled with Lewis that is inspired by Ocasio-Cortez, is met with a cacophony of applause. An audience member mooting the role nuclear power might have in addition to renewables is quickly talked down. The Norwegian singer Aurora released A Different Kind of Human (Step II), an album themed around ecological disaster, earlier this month. Before performing on the John Peel stage, she tells me that she always knew the album was going to be about the climate crisis. When I ask if she will be sticking around after her set, the answer is no, because she is flying to Belgium. What does she do to lessen her own environmental impact, especially when touring? She mentions wooden toothbrushes and being vegetarian. Johannes Hogebrink, an artist from Amsterdam, has also flown to the UK for Glastonbury and is busy crafting a sand sculpture for Extinction Rebellion. The sculpture is a huge skull with a beetle crawling out of one eye and money coming out of the mouth. \u201cYou cannot eat money, oh no!\u201d as Aurora\u2019s song The Seed has it. Over at the Shangri-La, this year\u2019s theme is \u201cJunkstaposition\u201d and it is home to the Disruption Bureau, a training centre for activists. Organisations including Amnesty International and Extinction Rebellion offer activities such as placard-making and flag-printing, but the most common interactions I observe are the handing out of leaflets and the signing of petitions. However, there is a great audio installation by Echoic Audio called Memory Tree, and the open-air art pieces are impressive, if not beautiful (that\u2019s kind of the point), including trees that are made from assorted waste. The Gas Tower is made entirely from recovered ocean plastic. Before her panel, I ask Lucas about Glastonbury 2011, when she appeared on the Pyramid stage before Wu-Tang Clan. \u201cIt was great,\u201d she says, \u201cinspiring and exciting. But terrifying.\u201d She is thrilled that young ipeople are taking up the climate cause, such as George Bond, a 16-year-old activist, also on the panel. Equally inspiring at the other end of the age spectrum is Barbara Richardson, here on behalf of the Fracking Nanas. Bond throws an important date out, 20 September, which he says will be \u201cthe largest climate demonstration this country ever has seen. It\u2019s gonna be huge, it\u2019s gonna be beautiful, but it\u2019s also gonna be filled with anger and rage that nothing has been done.\u201d Last week, the government pledged to get net emissions down to zero by 2050. But it is simply not good enough. As Lucas puts it, it\u2019s a bit like calling the fire brigade in an emergency and asking them to turn up in 30 years\u2019 time. As the burning sun goes down and jumpers are pulled out from backpacks, a man tosses his chip wrapper on the ground, his mate crushing a can before hurling it into the grass. A bunch of people take cocaine in the gloaming, which in its own way is ravaging the parts of the world Kurikunda talked about protecting. Glastonbury is making a massive effort, albeit with room for improvement. And the ecstatic response to Attenborough is an indication that environmentalism is much cooler than it ever was \u2013 people genuinely care now. But we\u2019ll know soon enough whether the festivalgoers matched the organisers\u2019 green aspirations and took away with them not just brilliant memories, possible sunburn and multiple blisters, but all the other rubbish they were asked politely to do so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
