I've wanted to put a British identity back into Rangers, because that has been missing, but circumstances in terms of pricing and ability have made that difficult. Kris is an example of the type of talent that is out there, and a few young players are coming through in the SPL which has been healthy for the Scottish game.\" The relatively modest transfer fee for Boyd shows that McLeish may not have to look much further as he seeks value-for-money purchases. The Hearts duo of Andy Webster and Craig Gordon, for example, have been touted for a move to Ibrox next month. Webster was refused permission to speak to Rangers in July, while Gordon would solve an inevitable goalkeeping problem which will arise at Ibrox at the end of the season when the contracts of Ronald Waterreus and Stefan Klos expire. Boyd relishes the prospect of Champions League action in February. The scorer of 15 league goals so far this season, though, was still in something of a daze about the move. \"It won't sink in until I'm actually in the team,\" he said. \"I know the aspects of my game I need to work on, but I feel I've improved this season.\" Boyd's arrival should also signal the end of a short stay in Scotland for Francis Jeffers, who has failed to find the net since joining from Charlton Athletic. His loan deal finishes next month, and sources at Ibrox say it will not be extended."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
