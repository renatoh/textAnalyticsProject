Developed under the guidance of the Arctic Eider Society, the app aims to draw on the catalogue of traditional knowledge that has helped the Inuit thrive in an unforgiving region. Named after the Inuktitut word for sea ice, Siku is intended to provide an all-in-one system of critical information for hunters. \u201cWe\u2019re copying what our parents used to do, but in modern ways,\u201d Lucassie Arragutainaq, manager of the Sanikiluaq Hunters and Trappers Association in Nunavut, told Canadian Press. The app was devised to address the growing number of accidents in which hunters unexpectedly plunge through ice. Knowledge accrued over thousands of years has traditionally helped hunters read and test ice, but many have seen troubling changes to ice behaviour in recent years. A growing body of evidence has found that Canada\u2019s Arctic is warming at a rate much faster than the rest of the world. By drawing on satellite data and user-submitted tagging, Siku\u2019s developers hope to provide better and more up-to-date information to hunters. In one example, the society\u2019s executive director, Joel Heath, told how a hunter saw a narrow crack in sea ice. After he tagged it, satellite stats later showed that the crack soon morphed into a cleavage so large that hunters on the ocean side of the ice would have been trapped. \u201cIt shows how [a hunter] taking a few photos and tagging can mobilize Indigenous knowledge,\u201d said Heath. The app also has features that let hunters indicate where wildlife has been spotted \u2013 seals, narwhal, rabbits and polar bear \u2013 to direct others to bountiful hunting grounds. Siku also includes a function to upload stories \u2013 a nod to the importance of storytelling as a repository of knowledge and information among communities. The app was unveiled last week at the ArcticNet conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was previously a winner of Google\u2019s 2017 Impact Challenge, bringing in $750,000 in development funding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
