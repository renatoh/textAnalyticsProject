The move could involve making a bid for the owner of the rail network or offering to run operations. Potential bidders, according to rumours in the City, include Japanese investment group Nomura, whose interests range from bookmakers to pubs, and French group Vivendi, former owner of the Connex South Central franchise. But sources close to Nomura played down the idea. A spokesman for the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions said last night: \"The secretary of state would have to approve any transfer of the company out of administration. \"He would of course consider any realistic offer which the administrators put to him. The company limited by guarantee proposed by the secretary of state covers the company's previous and future liabilities. Other proposals would have to be at least as good.\" Last night a spokesman for the government-appointed administrator said that a number of approaches had been received for the company, but that the process was \"still in the very early days\". He said none of the bidders had progressed to the stage where they were able to request any information about Railtrack and that no confidentiality agreements had yet been signed - a crucial first step in any takeover of a company in administration. Earlier yesterday an alliance of powerful City investment groups met to plot a full-scale battle with the government over Railtrack as transport secretary Stephen Byers dug in his heels over his no-cash stance for shareholders. In an increasingly ill-tempered standoff, Railtrack's chief executive, Steve Marshall, accused ministers of \"mugging\" investors by renationalising through the back door. But government officials poured scorn on his claims, blaming misguided management for Railtrack's demise. After talks in London between associations representing a majority of Railtrack shares, the Institutional Shareholders' Committee set up a working party to fight the government for compensation. Legal &amp; General's investment director, David Rough, who chaired the committee, said: \"The rights of all stakeholders must be respected, including those of small savers and pensioners whose funds are managed by institutions.\" The committee included delegates from the Association of British Insurers, the National Association of Pension Funds, private investors association Autif and the Association of Investment Trust Companies. In a parallel move, law firm Allen &amp; Overy is preparing an action against ministers on behalf of fund managers holding more than 20% of the shares. But the government made it clear that it would not use tax payers' money to compensate disappointed investors. One government source said: \"It is slightly ironic that Railtrack's management are now the champions of shareholder value. We have seen a collapse of Railtrack's share price over the past three years at a time when the government has been pumping billions of pounds into the company.\" Officials pointed out that Railtrack's share price had fallen from \u00a318 at the end of 1998 to \u00a32.80 when it was put into administration. They said it had received a generous settlement in the 2000 spending review. In April 2001, the government brought forward a further \u00a31.5bn for the 2001-06 period."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
