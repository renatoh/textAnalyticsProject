After the Strike was written by the novelist Barry Hines in 1985 and depicted graphic scenes of police violence against striking miners at the Battle of Orgreave a year earlier. Despite Hines being at the height of his critical acclaim at the time, the work was never broadcast and lay untouched for 35 years until it was discovered by researchers in the late author\u2019s university archive. The work, which will be performed for the first time at Sheffield\u2019s Kelham Island Museum on 18 June, is described as an unflinching account of clashes between police and miners at Orgreave on 18 June 1984 and the \u201cmultiple corrosive effects\u201d it had on the South Yorkshire community. The play was found among other unpublished works in Hines\u2019s archive, which was donated to the University of Sheffield after his death, aged 76, in March 2016. It was accompanied by a note from his wife, Eleanor Hines, which said she had a \u201cvague memory of \u2018the powers that be\u2019 not being interested in the strike any more\u201d. Dr David Forrest, a senior lecturer in film studies at the University of Sheffield, said Hines became deeply embedded with the National Union of Mineworkers and carried out a series of interviews with miners after the clashes at Orgreave. His two unpublished accounts, one of which is After the Strike, were too politically sensitive to be aired at the time, Forrest said. \u201cIt\u2019s true that they are very, very politically didactic and explicit and they make absolutely no bones about their position,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been unrealistic to expect any broadcaster to have picked them up at the time, particularly because they depict quite graphically police brutality at Orgreave. It was clearly something he had to get out of his system.\u201d Hines, whose most famous book A Kestrel for a Knave inspired Ken Loach\u2019s classic film Kes, was at the height of his acclaim in 1985 following his Bafta-winning drama-documentary Threads, which was set in Sheffield during the cold war and chronicled the effect of a nuclear bomb dropped on a northern English city. The son and grandson of mineworkers, Hines \u201cmourned what he saw as the wanton destruction of communities\u201d, Forrest said, and was \u201cparticularly exercised by the events at Orgreave and their consequences\u201d. \u201cAs a committed working-class writer, Hines felt duty-bound to document what he had seen over the course of the strike,\u201d he said. \u201cThis performance is now a chance for people to experience one of Hines\u2019s unpublished pieces of work for the first time while also celebrating his legacy and commemorating the struggles of miners and their families on the 35th anniversary of the Battle of Orgreave.\u201d Hines, who was born in a mining village near Barnsley, had described how he desperately wanted to write television screenplays about the miners\u2019 strike and wrote scripts for the BBC, but \u201cthey did not work\u201d. After the Strike\u2019s first airing is taking place as part of a series of exhibitions on gentrification, hipster culture and regeneration hosted by the University of Sheffield and the Kelham Island Museum. Built in the 1100s, Kelham Island was for centuries a key part of the steel city\u2019s industrial power. In recent years, however, the island\u2019s once-booming cutlery and steel works, factories and workshops have become transformed into a hipster paradise with microbreweries, galleries and independent shopping arcades. Dr Amanda Crawley Jackson, the director of engagement at the University of Sheffield\u2019s faculty of arts and humanities, said the exhibition aimed to tell the untold stories behind the island\u2019s regeneration \u201cand the impact this change has and continues to have on people in the local community\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
