Certainly not Marianne Jean-Baptiste in In Fabric, the latest, laudably bonkers movie by Peter Strickland. Ignoring the sales assistant\u2019s vampiric demeanour, Jean-Baptiste falls in love with the dress she tries on (colour: \u201cartery red\u201d), only to find it is a haunted garment that inflicts upon its wearers pain, suffering and a nasty rash. Like so many before her, Jean-Baptiste is a literal fashion victim; a woman who pays the price for seeking to make herself look better. It is a notion that harks back to fairytales and pulp horror fiction, and \u2013 by the look of things \u2013 is still very much in vogue. Powell and Pressburger\u2019s 1948 The Red Shoes is the textbook example: the Faustian footwear brings no joy for ballerina Moira Shearer in life or art. In Fabric also brings to mind Tobe \u201cTexas Chainsaw Massacre\u201d Hooper\u2019s little-seen I\u2019m Dangerous Tonight (1990), in which a red dress made from cursed Aztec fabric turns the women who wear it into wanton psycho killers. But most of all, Strickland\u2019s movie harks back to the classic Italian horrors, which were never knowingly under-styled, especially when it came to womenswear. Mario Bava\u2019s Blood and Black Lace (1964) sees a serial killer picking off fashion models, while red shoes again play a part in Dario Argento\u2019s 1982 movie Tenebrae. It was a golden age of male directors dressing women up then watching then get violently murdered, although in retrospect, the whole giallo genre looks like a fashion mood board. The associations between women, beauty, fashion and horror still run deep. Look at The Neon Demon, where Elle Fanning\u2019s ingenue model is eaten up by predatory lesbian fashionistas. Coming soon is Justin Simien\u2019s horror satire Bad Hair, described as \u201cthe story of an ambitious young woman working in the image-obsessed world of music television who gets a weave that may have a mind of its own\u201d. Simien admitted he got the idea from a Korean horror movie called The Wig. \u201cThis is my way of writing a love letter about all of the BS that black women have to go through,\u201d he said last year. To its credit, In Fabric puts a more contemporary spin on things. The cursed dress is worn by a man at one stage, for starters. This being a Peter Strickland movie, nothing is clear cut, everything looks fabulous, and it\u2019s much funnier than it sounds. \u201cI just wanted to explore people\u2019s neurotic connection with clothing,\u201d he explained in a recent interview. That is clearly an ongoing concern. Perhaps his next move should be a remake of The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants? In Fabric is in cinemas from Friday 28 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
