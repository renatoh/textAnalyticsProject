They do football, they do beach volleyball, they do samba and sunbathing and being sexy and diving into crashing waves (somehow managing to emerge gracefully and without spluttering snot bubbles and embarrassingly dislodged swimwear). But hiking? It's just not in their DNA. Which might explain why they've managed to keep the Chapada Diamantina national park in Bahia a secret for so long: most of them don't even know it's there. You might think it would be tricky to overlook an area 10 times the size of the New Forest but Brazil is a big country and the north-eastern state of Bahia has more than its share of rival attractions. There's the city of Salvador for a start. With its seething sensuality, pounding African rhythms, the mysterious rituals of the Candombl\u00e9 religion, writhing capoeira dancers and spicy cuisine, it makes Rio look as straitlaced and European as Geneva. After three days in the city, the beaches of Bahia will be calling. With 1,000 kilometres of palm-fringed coastline, there's enough variety to keep the most ardent sun-worshipper occupied for weeks on end. But those who tear themselves away from the coast and venture inland will be richly rewarded. Some 300km inland from Salvador, Chapada Diamantina is Brazil's big country: a rousing landscape of table-top mountains, thundering waterfalls, dramatic canyons and hidden caves. The air is cooler here, the pace of life slower, crime almost non-existent: in short, it's a perfect antidote to the heat, hassle and hedonism of the coastal fleshpots. But first you have to get there. There are weekly flights from Salvador to Len\u00e7\u00f3is, which is the gateway to the park. The alternative is a gruelling six-hour drive west along a road which, in certain parts, resembles the surface of the moon. The advantage of going by road, however, is that you get to see Bahia's rec\u00f4ncavo, a lush belt of tobacco, coffee and sugar plantations and pretty colonial towns surrounding the city of Salvador. Lenauro, my guide and driver for the week, picks me up from my hotel in Salvador and we head out of town past the slums and petrochemical stations and into a rolling landscape of sugar cane and orange plantations, cashew nut trees and bamboo forests. Occasionally the greenery is punctuated by the protruding brick chimney of an old sugar mill - a remnant of the days when this was one of the most important sugar growing regions in the world. We pass through the old mill town of Santo Amaro, which seems to sit in a sun-baked stupor, faded and pastel-pretty. There's a tourist coach parked outside one of the small terraced houses on the high street. Lenauro tells me it's the childhood home of Caetano Veloso and Maria Bet\u00e2nia, two of Brazil's most successful musicians. Their 92-year-old mother still lives here and the sibling superstars often return home to perform at the town fair. Which I suppose is the equivalent of Elton John dropping by the Pinner summer fete to give an impromptu performance. We stop for a lunch of fried chicken, rice and beans in Cachoeira, a museum-piece town of ornate colonial buildings once famous for producing the finest tobacco in the world. Heat shimmers off the cobbles and the streets are deserted. It's only as we drive across the rickety bridge spanning the Paragua\u00e7u river that we see what appears to be the entire population of the town, splashing about in the water below. Cars parked on the river bank, their doors wide open, blast out the pulsing rhythms of afox\u00e9, children float by on car tyres, men sit around drinking beer. On the other side of the river the colour seems to leach out of the landscape. This is the sert\u00e3o, the Brazilian outback, a land of cowboys, cactus, drought and harsh poverty. The drive after this point would have been monotonous were it not for the fact that every five minutes Lenauro has to swerve the car to avoid the crater-sized potholes or the juggernauts lurching towards us in the middle of the road. It's dark by the time we arrive in Len\u00e7\u00f3is and check into the comfortable Hotel de Len\u00e7\u00f3is which will be our base for the next four days. Len\u00e7\u00f3is is an old diamond-mining town and its former wealth is reflected in the beautiful 19th-century buildings which surround the main square. Diamonds from the Chapada Diamantina riverbeds were used to tip the drills used in the making of the London Underground and the Panama Canal. With the abolition of slavery and the discovery of mines in South Africa the boom petered out, though prospecting continues in the area even today, albeit on a much smaller scale. In 1985, the area was made a national park and the locals turned their attention to tourism. Len\u00e7\u00f3is today is a charming and laidback place. It's well geared up to travellers, with internet cafes, outdoor equipment suppliers and a good choice of guesthouses, bars and restaurants, including a couple of decent vegetarian options (a rarity in Brazil). The town has attracted a lot of outsiders - Brazilians from the cities, Americans and Europeans - who have come in search of the good life. A lot of them have settled in the nearby Vale do Cap\u00e3o, which has a strong New Age feel with farm shops selling everything from healing crystals to organic honey. You would need at least five days here to do justice to all the activities and excursions on offer. Choose from horseriding, climbing, trekking and caving, or take a jeep tour to local beauty spots such as waterfalls and spectacular caves. One of the most popular excursions is to Marimbus, a marshy wetland where you can canoe on lagoons filled with giant waterlilies, looking for birds and caiman. The locals here are descendents of a quilombo, a community of runaway slaves, who lived here, cut off from the rest of the world, until they were discovered in the 1960s, oblivious to the fact that slavery had been abolished in 1888. The hiking possibilities are endless, everything from a half-day trek to the impressive Fuma\u00e7a waterfall, which disappears over a dizzying 420m drop, to four or five-day camping expeditions. It's essential to have a guide as the routes are not marked. My guide, Ari, leads me on a 25km hike from the village of Cap\u00e3o to Len\u00e7\u00f3is along an old mule trail. Ari's father worked as a diamond miner. In 30 years he found only two diamonds of any value. With the first he bought a house. With the second he bought a bar in Len\u00e7\u00f3is selling cacha\u00e7a, Brazilian sugar cane rum, to tourists. The trail winds between ancient sandstone outcrops with names like the Camel and the Three Brothers. We cross and recross streams, stopping to swim in cool waterholes when the going gets too hot. Ari points out tiny pink orchids (there are 150 species here), butterflies, lizards and humming birds, while parakeets squawk noisily overhead. He climbs a tree and shakes down ripe mangos. He tells me he has never left Bahia and for a moment I feel ashamed that I have seen more of his country than he has. But it's only a moment. Because then it occurs to me: if you are going to be stuck in the same place for the rest of your life, you could do a lot worse than Bahia.
