Although Newcastle\u2019s owner is yet to accept a formal bid for the club lodged by Staveley\u2019s Dubai-based PCP Capital Partners, negotiations are continuing and it remains just about feasible for a buyout to be completed by the new year. \u201cIf we have a change in ownership, we know we\u2019ll not have too much money [in January] ,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez who face Watford at home on Saturday after three successive defeats. \u201cThe financial fair play rules don\u2019t allow you to spend massive money. If it\u2019s a new ownership or if it\u2019s the same one, the figures could be very similar. It won\u2019t be a massive difference.\u201d It is understood FFP regulations would permit Ben\u00edtez to invest around \u00a330m in January, although increased income would dictate that Newcastle could be free to spend considerably more next summer. The fear among fans is that, should Staveley\u2019s bid collapse and Ashley remain in control, such a scenario may become academic. Yet Newcastle\u2019s manager did not demur when asked whether he could envisage being at St James\u2019 Park this time next year were the takeover to fail. \u201cI think so,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m quite happy with this group of players. They\u2019re improving, they\u2019re learning. I don\u2019t see any difficulty. I was not very happy in August [when Ashley strictly rationed his transfer plans]. But still this [club] is a chance for me. \u201cMy disappointment last summer was because I was trying to finish in the top 10 this season. Now it\u2019s about being sure that we stay in the Premier League. It\u2019s a challenge for me but I have the belief this group of players can stay in the Premier League. Then, when we stay up we can make the next step and improve the team because we\u2019ll have more money \u2013 but before you can run you have to walk.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
