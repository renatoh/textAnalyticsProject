One inmate has been killed, regional officials said on Saturday, and another guard hospitalised. The body of the prisoner was discovered underneath debris after special forces retook control of the prison. \u201cIt was a violent death,\u201d said Viktor Ignatenko, the regional human rights ombudsmen. It was not immediately clear whether the man died when authorities raided the prison late Friday night. Ignatenko said that authorities were investigating whether he had been killed by fellow inmates. Videos posted to social media on Friday showed buildings ablaze at the IK-15 prison in the Siberian city of Angarsk, 2,500 miles southeast of Moscow and near Lake Baikal\u2019s southern shore Prisoners had earlier attacked a guard and began to cut themselves using pieces of broken glass from security cameras, according to the region\u2019s prison service. Prisoners in Russia\u2019s penal colonies sometimes perform acts of self-harm as an act of protest. The rioters, of whom there were an estimated 16 or 17, later set fire to workshops and barricaded themselves inside the prison\u2019s work zone. Officers late on Friday evening claimed to have retaken the prison and were \u201cevaluating the damage\u201d. At least one guard was taken to hospital in the initial riot, but it was not clear how many were injured or killed when local special forces retook the prison. Human rights activists said that police had cordoned off the area. Videos sent to activists and posted to social media showed prisoners claiming to be trapped as special forces bore down on them. \u201cThey\u2019re beating everyone, everyone is cut,\u201d the prisoner said, indicating the bandages tied around his wounds. \u201cThe whole area is on fire.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re going to kill us,\u201d another says. An earlier video believed to have sparked the riot showed a prisoner with a bloodied bandage on his left arm accusing a guard of beating him. \u201cThe police are out of control \u2013 and not for the first time,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
