Andy Ruiz\u2019s story is a lesson in hope\u2019", "bodyText": "\u201cAll the joy and all the pain came out,\u201d Manny Robles says as he remembers how he cried after his fighter, Andy Ruiz Jr beat Anthony Joshua in one of the greatest shocks in the history of heavyweight boxing. \u201cEverything comes out when you\u2019re jumping for joy and screaming that we shocked the world.\u201d Ruiz, dismissed as a roly-poly no-hoper, got off the canvas in the third round and immediately dropped Joshua twice with shuddering punches. Using his fast hands, intelligence and heart, Ruiz listened to everything his trainer told him. He knocked down Joshua twice more in the seventh round before the referee stopped the contest and confirmed the Mexican-American as the new IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight champion of the world. A week after this astonishing upset, early on a Saturday morning at his gym on the outskirts of Los Angeles, Robles talks beautifully about the adversity he and Ruiz overcame. Robles is a modest man and so, before he details how his own life fell apart 12 years ago, he highlights the impact Ruiz has had on so many people who had never even heard of him before he stunned the unbeaten Joshua. \u201cI knew we had made history,\u201d Robles says. \u201cAndy had become the first Mexican heavyweight champion of the world. But now I think everybody, of all ethnicities and backgrounds, from all over the world, won. We identify more with Andy \u2013 although Joshua\u2019s a great guy and an unbelievable athlete. \u201cMost of us have more in common with Andy. Looking at Andy we\u2019re looking at ourselves and seeing that anything is possible. We have children being bullied for being overweight or for the colour of their skin. It\u2019s horrible but Andy\u2019s story is a lesson in hope. He had to endure being harassed because he doesn\u2019t have a Joshua-type body. He\u2019s been teased for his looks. He\u2019s been doubted his whole life, because Andy\u2019s always been overweight.\u201d Was he bullied as a kid? \u201cAbsolutely but Andy fought back. He always had great self-esteem. He\u2019s a positive individual in spite of the way he may look. Andy knows it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that matters.\u201d Ruiz turned to Robles after losing his unbeaten record against Joseph Parker in December 2016 \u2013 but last summer he felt depressed. \u201cA year ago Andy was down on his luck and unable to provide for his family. He was ready to throw in the towel. He was at a dark stage but I sat down with him and said: \u2018Hey kid, don\u2019t give up. A year from now everything is going to be different. I had a dream you fought Joshua for the world title. I know exactly what punch you\u2019ll knock him out with.\u2019\u201d Was this just a little yarn to boost his sagging fighter? \u201cI did have the dream,\u201d Robles insists, \u201cbecause Andy\u2019s special. Even when he wasn\u2019t showing up in the gym, I would call him: \u2018Where you at kid? We\u2019ll pick you up.\u2019 There was a point when he didn\u2019t have a place to stay in LA. My friend had an extra room in his apartment so I asked him to help. Not only did he give Andy a roof over his head but he also became his chef. Everything changed when Andy came back to the gym in January. He came in with a big promoter [Al Haymon] who got him a fight with Alexander Dimitrenko in April. We had a 10-week camp.\u201d Ruiz was given the unexpected opportunity to fight Joshua when the champion\u2019s original opponent, Jarrell Miller, failed a drug test. Despite his flabby appearance, Ruiz was battle-hardened after beating Dimitrenko who is, in Ruiz\u2019s phrase, \u201ca huge guy\u201d at 6ft 7in. Robles is canny and he knew Joshua has a tendency to drop his left hand after throwing a jab. So he always felt Joshua was open to be being knocked out by an overhand right. encouraged Ruiz to fight on the inside, using the angles against a much bigger man and working on the body punches that would drain Joshua. They also prepared the overhand right that would shatter Joshua\u2019s mystique. Ruiz, as a consequence, was strikingly relaxed before his first world title fight. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d Robles says. \u201cBoxers feed off their coaches. If you stay relaxed and positive they\u2019re the same. If you\u2019re nervous they sense it. Our job, as coaches, is to keep it positive, talk about the gameplan and stay as calm as possible. But yeah, as Mike Tyson said, everybody\u2019s got a plan until they get hit in the face.\u201d How did Robles react when Joshua dropped Ruiz? \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve had a boxer go down. It won\u2019t be the last. I stay relaxed. Next thing Andy drops Joshua twice [with two big right hands]. But you don\u2019t make a big deal of it. You get your boxer to stay calm and stick to the gameplan. Of course I was excited on the inside but I knew Joshua was still dangerous. Sure enough, we had to make some changes that benefited Andy.\u201d When the end came, with Joshua glazed and beaten, Robles was not the only member of his family to shed tears. \u201cI have 25-year-old twins, and one of them, my son, Manny Robles the third, is 18-0 as a pro. They were there with my wife and youngest daughter, because I was so positive. I wanted my family to witness the victory. \u201cMy wife found it difficult to watch. My kids told me she kept her head down and prayed for Andy. When the fight was over the kids said: \u2018Mom, we won.\u2019 She couldn\u2019t believe it. She broke down crying. My kids broke out crying. I\u2019d never seen my son cry before. He cried like a baby. Incredible.\u201d Robles cried when talking to reporters after the fight and now, in his hushed gym, he explains the reasons: \u201cMy story is of a young immigrant boy that came to the United States. My parents were trying to find a better life for us. I was six years old and can you imagine the difficulties? Coming to this strange country, not speaking the language, going to school with kids that only spoke English. As an immigrant I wasn\u2019t able to gain a proper education. I couldn\u2019t have a good job because I didn\u2019t have any documents or a social security number. I was illegal.\u201d His father, Manuel, was a well\u2011known boxing trainer. \u201cEverything I know comes from my dad. He was my mentor, my teacher, my best friend. I lost my dad on 3 March 2007 and the whole world came down on me. I also lost my job as I was involved in boxing with my dad. I lost my house. I hit rock bottom but Sandra, my wife of 25 years, hung in with me. \u201cShe\u2019s actually from the same city as me in Mexico. Guadalajara. Sandra became a US citizen first and she filed papers for me. That\u2019s how I became a United States resident. The moment I became a resident I went to school. I was 34. Imagine being in this country from the age of six to 34 without a passport. Imagine not being able to get a job with decent pay. It was my dream to become a citizen and take care of my family. After I went to school for four years, I got my degree in carpentry. Life is perseverance.\u201d In 2009, Robles became involved in amateur boxing while training his son. \u201cI was working as a carpenter in the day and going to the gym at night. My fighters started winning regional, state and national tournaments. I started getting recognition. But even when I was a coach on the US national team I wasn\u2019t a citizen. I was a permanent resident. At the world championships in 2011 this other US coach noticed my Mexican passport. He said: \u2018You\u2019re not supposed to be here.\u2019 That hurt me so much but, wow, the kids embraced me.\u201d At those same world championships, Robles met Joshua. \u201cI respect Anthony Joshua, man. He\u2019s such a humble, good person. He wins the silver medal but I thought he deserved gold. After the fight we\u2019re on the bus together. It\u2019s astonishing how mellow this kid is with his silver medal. Who knows how he felt inside? I congratulated him and we took a picture. He was such a gentleman. He\u2019s the same now as in 2011.\u201d Joshua has been criticised for accepting defeat against Ruiz too easily. He has also been told to ditch his trainer Robert McCracken. \u201cHis coach has taken a lot of heat,\u201d Robles says. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible. But Joshua is very loyal.\u201d Four of Robles\u2019s best boxers \u2013 \u00d3scar Valdez, Jessie Magdaleno, Dominic Breazeale and Michael Conlan \u2013 left him. The first two were world champions, Breazeale fought twice for the world heavyweight title and Conlan is one of boxing\u2019s brightest prospects. Stressing that he remains friends with Valdez and Conlan, Robles does not harbour grudges. Each boxer had a specific reason for leaving \u2013 with Conlan, for example, needing to train closer to home in Belfast. But the loss hurts. \u201cThe \u00d3scar Valdez situation is different,\u201d Robles says. \u201c\u00d3scar didn\u2019t want to leave. His manager [Frank Espinoza] and his dad had other ideas for him. He left along with every fighter managed by Espinoza. He took them off me for political reasons outside of boxing \u2013 not for my coaching.\u201d Robles initially asks to keep this between ourselves but, eventually, he says: \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m tired of people thinking \u00d3scar left because I wasn\u2019t doing a good job. You can ask \u00d3scar yourself.\u201d Now that he and Ruiz are on the rise does he believe the rematch with Joshua will result in a similar outcome? \u201cJoshua will come in with a new gameplan but so will we. I\u2019ll be looking at Joshua to see how we can improve. \u201cI respect Joshua because he hasn\u2019t used any excuses. He\u2019s a warrior and every time fighters step into the ring they put their lives on the line. That\u2019s why it\u2019s unfortunate people who have never boxed booed Joshua.\u201d The heavyweight division is full of intrigue and Robles says: \u201cSkills pay the bills, man, and Tyson Fury\u2019s got the skills. But Deontay Wilder\u2019s got the power. With that kind of power anything can happen.\u201d Can his rotund champion beat all three of his famous rivals? \u201cAbsolutely. Andy Ruiz can compete with anyone. He\u2019s proved that.\u201d On Monday, Robles and Ruiz flew to Mexico to meet the president \u2013 Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable. Everything feels awesome.\u201d Robles laughs when I say it would feel less awesome if they were meeting Donald Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re happier going to the Mexican White House. It hasn\u2019t been an easy time with Trump. He and his policies are not helpful for most of us. In the US we have people from all over the world. This is a country of immigrants. But Trump was busy [last] week with you guys in the UK. I wish you could keep him.\u201d Ruiz has appeared on the glossy TV circuit but Robles remains low\u2011key. \u201cAndy\u2019s dad called and said: \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going on the Jimmy Kimmel Show. Would you join us?\u2019 I said: \u2018\u2018No, I\u2019m working.\u2019 I flew in from New York on Sunday night and I was back in the gym on Monday.\u201d The trick will be for Robles to ensure Ruiz echoes that attitude. \u201cAndy\u2019s the world champion, so we have to make sure he stays disciplined and grounded. My job is to keep him in line and remind him what got him here. \u201cI know Andy will listen. We\u2019ve been through too much to give it all up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
