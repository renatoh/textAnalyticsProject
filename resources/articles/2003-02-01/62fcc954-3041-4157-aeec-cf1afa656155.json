She took the book and promptly lost it. Since then, I've poked around in many second-hand bookshops, hoping to find it again. But Sheckley, despite being the author of several dozen novels and hundreds of stories, has finally sunk into the obscurity that was always sucking at his heels. Admired by Kingsley Amis and championed by Brian Aldiss (who compared him to Voltaire and Swift), he never achieved success outside the science-fiction ghetto, nor did he become one of the genre's grand old men. Recent decades have found him collaborating on such franchises as Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. A melancholy fate for a writer whose best work is in no way inferior to that of his own hero, Italo Calvino. Or is it? It has been 15 years since I owned the book, and some of its stories I hadn't re-read since I was a teenager in the 1970s. What would I make of them now? Well, the internet has just reunited me with The Same To You Doubled. Two copies of it were found by a search engine trawling the online databases of second-hand bookshops. One of those copies is now on my desk. If you want the other one, it's waiting for you on a shelf in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. So, how was my reunion? It would be simple to answer that I've grown up and the book hasn't. Sci-fi is especially vulnerable to this scenario: it has always been a forum for big ideas, the sort that excite the imagination of a growing mind. It is also notoriously a haven for bad prose, idle daydreaming and perfunctory characterisation. Sheckley's prose is never less than competent, but some of the tales are feebler in conception than I remembered. There's one really excruciating \"joke\" story, \"Starting From Scratch\", about a microscopic alien civilisation attached to a man's itchy knuckle. Elsewhere, the ideas are witty but the characters lack flesh and soul. I was particularly shocked at how badly \"Can You Feel Any thing When I Do This?\" had aged. It's an erotic fable (first published in Playboy) about a domestic robot who falls in love with a sexually numb woman, massaging her almost to orgasm until she yanks the plug from his body, killing him rather than accept his \"horrible and unnatural\" love. When my teenage self read this story, I perceived pathos in it. Today, I see that it merely recycles the arrogant notion of female \"frigidity\" commonly held by males in 1969. Most of the 16 stories, however, are clever and thoughtful. Sheckley is especially good at exploring the collision of alternate realities, and the exasperation of hapless people attempting to tame the forces of chaos with a puny whip of reason. It was these skills that led Douglas Adams to use Sheckley's work - in particular the 1968 novel Dimension of Miracles - as the prototype for his Hitchhiker's Guide series. (Asked what he considered to be the major difference between his books and Sheckley's, Adams said, \"Sheckley's are better.\" Sheckley, asked the same question, replied, \"Doug Adams makes a lot more out of his books than I do out of mine.\") Yet Sheckley was more than a galactic humourist. Several of the most effective stories in The Same To You Doubled are not even science fiction. They conform to no genre. This, in itself, was inspirational to me as a young writer. I was determined to write about whatever I pleased, real or unreal, past or future. \"Cordle to Onion to Carrot\" is a wicked exploration of what happens when a meek, polite man experiments with being nastily self-assertive. Masterfully paced, it showed me how fictional arguments could be given enough momentum for the strings to become invisible. I was also thrilled and disturbed by a piece called \"Game: First Schematic\", whose mysteries I was too young to understand then. To my relief, the story that influenced me most has lost nothing during our separation. It's called \"Pas de Trois of the Chef and the Waiter and the Customer\", and is set in an Indonesian restaurant in Ibiza. The narrative is told three times over, each time from a different perspective. First, the chef confesses to God how he enslaved a customer to his rijstaffel, training the foreigner's palate with addictive sauces, driving him to obesity and ill health. Second, the young waiter confesses how he took advantage of this same customer's love of jazz, teasing and educating him with the careful selection of music piped through the restaurant's speakers. In the final account, the customer tells his story. He has been frequenting the restaurant because he has developed a passion for the waiter, who he is convinced is flirting with him shamelessly. He quite likes the food, enjoys the music - but it is the boy's glances and coded invitations that provoke him to madness. All three narrators not only disagree on details - each other's names, nationalities, motivations - but they also remember wildly different denouements for their drama, complete with emotionally fraught parting conversations. Summarised thus, the story may come across as an elaborate farce, but the characters are drawn with finesse and the atmosphere rings true. From this story I learned something that is at the heart of my own fiction - that people inhabit different realities. By this I don't mean that people differ in their ability to perceive the objective reality of the lives they share with others. I mean that each of us tends to live in an alternate universe, which may bear only the most incidental relationship to the universe inhabited by the next person. In many of his stories, Sheckley externalises this dilemma with the sci-fi paraphernalia of mind-warps and time-slips. Here, it is evoked with nothing more than three human beings trapped in a symbiosis of misunderstandings. Sheckley, in a rare interview, said that \"in science fiction we owe it to ourselves to see things in as many ways as we possibly can... To understand more... and broaden ourselves.\" This philosophy my long-lost copy of The Same To You Doubled still bears out today. Many of these tales are flawed entertainments whose blueprints I now find limiting. But \"Pas de Trois\" is a fine story by any standards, and deserves to be discovered by anyone interested in the craft of fiction. \u00b7 Michel Faber's latest book is The Crimson Petal and the White, published by Canongate, price \u00a317.99."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
