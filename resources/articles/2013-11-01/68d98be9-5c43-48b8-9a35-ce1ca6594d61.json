Opening on 1 December, it has four bedrooms \u2013 think pale grey walls, cream bed throws and orchids \u2013 a children's corner, with a Nintendo Wii and board games, and a spa treatment room (Ingrid is a trained beauty therapist).

From \u20ac85pp per night, half-board Hotel Spitzhorn, Gstaad, Switzerland Once exclusively the playground of the glitterati, Gstaad still has a full house of five-star hotels, but it's trying to shake off its \"cash-rich\" reputation with the introduction of some more affordable accommodation. Opening in December, the 50-room Hotel Spitzhorn in Saanen-Gstaad has been rebuilt with an eco-friendly focus: solar panels heat the water in your plush bathroom and in the spa (featuring an indoor pool, steam bath and Kneipp water-treading basin), while an electric shuttle takes you to the slopes. The small village is a five-minute drive (or 25-minute walk) from the centre of Gstaad, where the regional lift pass covers 250km of slopes. \u2022 +41 33 748 41 41, spitzhorn.ch.

From \u20ac75pp per night, half-board Villa Americana, Champoluc, Italy This house in Ayas, a few kilometres from Champoluc, was built by the owners' grandfather, who emigrated from America in the 50s. Following two years of renovations, it is opening this winter as a B&amp;B with six simple but spacious en suite bedrooms, some of which have views of the Monte Rosa massif. Take the shuttle bus to the lifts of Champoluc, part of the Monterosa ski area, which is home to the most underrated skiing in the Alps \u2013 both on-piste and off.

Doubles from \u20ac70 per nightroom only, B&amp;B Myrkdalen Hotel, Voss, Norway Opened last winter, this hotel ticks all the right boxes: smart bedrooms (the biggest suite has beds for 10 guests) that mix funky fabrics with old black-and-white photos of Myrkdalen folk; three restaurants, including one that serves Swiss-style fondue, and it is right on the slopes of the Myrkdalen Mountain Resort (a new six-seater chairlift, opening in December, will double the capacity of the resort). Voss, the largest ski resort in western Norway, is just a short drive away, and the hotel runs free ski shuttles there. \u2022 +47 56 52 30 61, myrkdalen.no.

Located just outside Cervinia (there is a private ski bus for guests), it has five rooms decorated in classic Italian alpine style: pine floors, walls and ceilings, big beds. There's also a sauna for warming your cockles after a day on the hill: Cervinia has some of the finest red-rated pistes in the Alps, including the 8km-long Ventina run. \u2022 +39 0166 948 758, lovevda.it. Doubles from \u20ac90 per night, B&amp;B L'Ours Blanc, Les Deux Alpes, France Here's one for skiers looking to live on baguettes and Beaufort all week (ie, self-catering), but who still want something with a bit of style. Renovated from top to bottom, L'Ours Blanc has 66 apartments sleeping between two and six, furnished with dark-wood floors, funky lighting and sleek, fully equipped kitchens. There's an indoor pool and on-site spa, though it's likely you'll spend most of your time on the slopes: L'Ours Blanc is 100m from the Diable chairlift, from where you can access the resort's many powder-filled gullies. \u2022 0844 576 0170, peakretreats.co.uk.
