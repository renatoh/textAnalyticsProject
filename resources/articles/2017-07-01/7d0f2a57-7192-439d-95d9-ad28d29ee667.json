Instead, the US president\u2019s eldest son did so via Twitter, igniting a firestorm of criticism around his apparent willingness to work with the Russian government against his father\u2019s Democratic rival. \u201cContacted Trump Jr this morning on why he should publish his emails (i.e with us),\u201d tweeted Assange, who is based at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. \u201cTwo hours later, does it himself.\u201d Asked by another Twitter user to explain, Assange elaborated: \u201cI argued that his enemies have it \u2013 so why not the public? His enemies will just milk isolated phrases for weeks or months ... with their own context, spin and according to their own strategic timetable. Better to be transparent and have the full context ... but would have been safer for us to publish it anonymously sourced. By publishing it himself it is easier to submit as evidence.\u201d It was not clear whether Assange\u2019s use of the word \u201cenemies\u201d was the reference to the media or political rivals. The Australian added: \u201cHe\u2019s surely had advice and/or is confident on the facts. I\u2019d argue that even the completely innocent need @WikiLeaks.\u201d WikiLeaks played a prominent role in the US presidential election, publishing emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, John Podesta. As a candidate, Trump declared: \u201cI love WikiLeaks!\u201d US intelligence agencies concluded that the hacking was carried out by Russia. Trump\u2019s longtime confidante Roger Stone communicated with Assange and a hacker known as \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d, who began posting DNC documents on 15 June \u2013 less than a week after Trump Jr\u2019s meeting with a Russian lawyer in New York. WikiLeaks\u2019 apparent overlap of interests with the Trump campaign drew scrutiny at the time. Robert Mackey of the Intercept website wrote in August last year: \u201cThe WikiLeaks Twitter feed has started to look more like the stream of an opposition research firm working mainly to undermine Hillary Clinton than the updates of a non-partisan platform for whistleblowers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
