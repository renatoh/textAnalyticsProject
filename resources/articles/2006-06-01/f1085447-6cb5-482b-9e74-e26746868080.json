But having presentable digits needn't mean a weekly trip to a beauty salon. Celebrity nail technician Leighton Denny suggests that before a home manicure you should have 'removed all trace of old varnish and put on cuticle remover so it can soak in' - then you can get down to the serious business of filing your nails, 'always from side to middle, not in a sawing action'. The shape is up to you, but the latest fashion dictates that the squared-off look synonymous with footballers' wives is most definitely out, and soft, oval nails are currently desirable. Hands should be soaked; then, using an orange stick, 'gently push back cuticles in tiny circular movements'. Don't be tempted to hack away or pull at those pesky cuticles, because 'cuticle is like banana peel and will keep unravelling'. Use a gentle exfoliating scrub and rub in some good hand cream. Last, massage in nail oil - and throw those gloves in the bin. Stevie Brown Cuticle oil, \u00a39.75, by Mavala, 01732 459412.
