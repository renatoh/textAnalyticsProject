Does it depend on the height of the wall, or should one just go with what looks right? It does depend on personal taste, but there are some rules of thumb, says Faye Fleming, curator at the Timothy Taylor Gallery, London. 'When hanging pictures of different sizes, one of the best ways to make them look good is to find the midpoint - ie, a central point on the wall where the centre of each picture should sit, usually about 1.5m from the floor. Then the tops and bottoms can be all different heights, but there's still a sense of order. 'If you have a horizontal piece of furniture or a feature you want to set off, try hanging pictures just above it, with the bottom edges matching. But beware hanging them too high up in a room - the rule is you should be able to look slightly down on them. 'For that trendy, messy-wall look with lots of photographs in higgledypiggledy order and mismatched frames, decide on the space you want to fill (roughly where the top, bottom and side edges will be), hang a picture in the centre and take it from there.' Low lights and uplights Our cottage's largish living room has a low (6ft) ceiling with two central lights that we hardly use, preferring lamps on tables or lampstands. So what do we do with the light fittings? One obvious solution is to remove the electrics , but that seems drastic. Another is to fit inset ceiling lights but we're not sure if they'll look right. The first thing to do, and as a matter of urgency, is to remove those central pendants - they're cluttering up an already cramped space and, as you say, they're unnecessary. You will need the services of an electrician to help with your new lighting scheme anyway, and it's not a huge job to poke the wiring back into the ceiling cavity and plaster over the hole. Don't be fearful of removing them - a single, low hanging bulb in the middle of a ceiling is the cruellest lighting a room can have. With a ceiling as low as yours, you should paint it white, to reflect as much light as possible. Next, select a mixture of task and ambient light, strategically placed around the room. To minimise the feeling of claustrophobia that can be caused by a low ceiling, try a series of uplighters around the walls. These will bounce light up on to your white ceiling and back down into the room, increasing the sense of height. Combine these with lamps in the corners for a softer, more mellow evening light. These can be easily wired together on to a single switch, saving you having to go round each evening turning them all on and off.
