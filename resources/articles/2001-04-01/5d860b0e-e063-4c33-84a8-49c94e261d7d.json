The Bohemian Jan Dismas Zelenka was much admired by Bach, who must have recognised in him a kindred spirit. Performing Zelenka's Lamentations of Jeremiah alongside one of Bach's cantatas, Robert King and his King's Consort demonstrated that Zelenka's music does at least make comparisons to Bach feasible. However, presenting the Lamentations end to end did make the evening rather a long haul. Even the brief first half didn't fly by. Bach's Cantata BWV 161 was not written for Passiontide but, with its text concerning death and rebirth, it was still seasonal. Although it was played sensitively, King's stolid tempos at times threatened to hold back the musicians' momentum - and they, in turn, seemed to stifle alto soloist Robin Blaze. However, tenor James Gilchrist managed to convey the expressive yearning of Mein Verlangen. They were joined in the two choral numbers by bass Peter Harvey, singing above just audible florid recorders; soprano Rebecca Outram completed the vocal quartet for these numbers, but her bright, soloistic voice did not blend well with the others. Zelenka wrote six Lamentations, a pair each for Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Saturday. They were never intended to be performed on the same day - let alone one after the other, as they were in the second half. Each one is like a mini Bach cantata, scored for alto, tenor or bass soloist with a different combination of instruments. And each has sections of declamatory music introduced by a more lyrical passage in which is sung the name of the Hebrew letter that begins the original verse. There is variety in Zelenka's music; indeed, there are lively, long-breathed melodies worthy of Bach. But after the third or fourth such piece one longed for a change in the format. Harvey launched resonantly into the first Lamentation and he and Gilchrist negotiated well the many changes of pace within each piece. However, all six are a test of stamina for the soloist, and only Blaze seemed fresh throughout. Happily, Zelenka saved his most beguiling music for the final day's settings, and the musicians responded: the cellos relished their duet in the fifth Lamentation, while a long-awaited bassoon melody in the sixth added new texture. But without this kind of interest throughout, King's enterprise seemed intended to educate rather than captivate."}, "isHosted": false}}}
