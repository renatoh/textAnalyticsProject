That means Eric Djemba-Djemba will make his first European start alongside Nicky Butt, while The Wes Brown Comedy Experience plays in central defence. Gloom, etc: \"I'm stuck in an office in Jamaica, and I've just seen the bloody team,\" writes Rob Smyth. \"This is moider. I think we're going out...\" 1 min We're off! Listen to Old Trafford roar! And already we have a world record of sorts as Clive Tydlesley mentions United's 2-1 win against Bayern in 1999 before the kick-off. What's the betting it won't be the last time? 3 min: Formation watch: Van Nistelrooy seems to be the lone man up front in Fergie's cautious 4-5-1. Meanwhile the offers are flooding in. \"Pablamos Cigars Espa\u00f1a the home of fine Habanos Cuban cigars, worldwide delivery guaranteed, go to http://www.pablamos.com says Pablo, who names Barry \"El Corruptee\" Glendenning as a loyal customer. 5 min: FC Divers, sorry FC Porto, are at it again. Paulo Ferreira is lightly brushed by Darren Fletcher and goes down like he's been dropped by a young Sonny Liston. 7 min: After the early sparring, at last some action: Van Nistelrooy charges in the box before crashing into Costa's legs. It's an obvious dive - hell, this is Van Nistelrooy we're talking about - but does win a corner. However Baia eases the pressure with a simple take. 9 min: \"The pressure's on, Sean,\" says Rob Hisnay apropos of nothing. \"Can your minute-by-minute make the Guardian's top 10 most read pages, like Nick Harper's did two weeks ago?\" My fingers are trembling, Rob. 12 min: Fantastic skill from Van Nistelrooy, who cuts inside two defenders before being brought down right on the edge of the area. Paul Scholes steps up to take the free-kick .... 13 min:... and screws it well wide. Not a good effort. 15 min: Like a couple on a first date, it's taking a while for any noticeable action to take place. Still, Porto have just made their first foray forward - although it ended abruptly when the ball clunked off Maniche's knee and off for a goal kick. 18 min: Phil Neville gets booked for a slicing bite-yer-legs foul on Deco, whose Greg Louganis dive makes it look far worse than it was. \"Rob Smyth in Jamaica is complaining?\" fumes John Thompson, whom I'm guessing is not the British TV actor (and if you are, didn't Cold Feet get rubbish at the end?). \"I'm in upstate New York where there's about three feet of months old snow on the ground, and more is coming down as I type.\" Still, there are worse places to live than upstate New York. 20 min: Porto have woken up: they've dominated possession in the last five minutes. Still a pretty dire game though. 22 min: Costinha chops down Van Nistelrooy, result: yellow card. Amazing Baia, who's surely one of the worst keepers in Europe now David Seaman's retired, manages to hold on to the resulting free-kick. 25 min: At long, long last the game's starting to open up - and, in the space of a minute, both sides have chances. First Costinha's woeful backpass puts in Van Nistelrooy, who looks like having a one-on-one with Baia, but dozily allows Costa to block him out. Then Porto rush up the other end only for Gary Neville to block Alberto's pile-driver. 28 min: After that flash of excitement, it's gone all waltz-slow again. Finally, Deco shows his artfulness (there's a joke to be made there somewhere, perhaps), backheeling the ball into the pack of McCarthy. His shot is well blocked by Phil's brother Gary though. 31 min: United aren't offering much up front, and the odd discordant murmur is being heard around Old Trafford. But wait ruddy one second! John O'Shea suddenly gets some space down the left after a neat one-two with Ryan Giggs, checks back in and finds the head of Paul Scholes. GOAL! 1-0 United. 33 min: The home crowd are in full voice now, and the cheers grow even louder when Jorge Costa pulls up lame with what looks like a torn hamstring. Can't see him getting back on with that. 35 min: Costa, whose gnarled face looks like a beaten-up 1950s light-heavyweight, wants to come back on, but the Porto medical staff eventually persuade him otherwise. He's replaced by Pedro Emmanuel. 37 min: This from Martin Bristow, continuing the worst-place-in-the-world-to-live debate.\"My in-laws live upstate in East Nassau near Albany and its horrible!\" he says. \"They do however own a very nice antiques store - Young's Antiques, \"Where History meets today at a price you can afford.\" 40 min: Djemba-Djemba - who's played really well - has a shocker, slicing horribly in United's box. Suddenly Carlos Alberto is in, but his close-range shot is well-blocked by Howard and Maniche's follow up flies over the bar. A huge let off. 42 min: Well, here's a surprise: Porto are up to their old tricks again. Carlos Alberto tries to win a penalty with a blatant dive in the box, but the Russian referee's not buying it. No yellow card though. \"I went to college in Plattsburgh in extreme upstate New York,\" writes Greg Wegner. \"It is where snow goes to die. Think the ice planet Hoth, and you are on the right lines.\" 45 min: Goal United! The ball pinballs about Porto's box before Scholes tucks home O'Shea's shot from close range ... but wait - the linesman puts up a late, late flag and the goal is ruled out. Replays show that Scholes was definitely onside. Random half-time emails: \"I asked my boss if he knew of any website where I could listen to this match and he said he'd rather read the Guardian text commentary than listen or watch or actually be at the match!\" says Emmett Williams in New York. \"But he's a lifelong Spurs supporter.\" Boom, boom, etc. \"Can you say a quick hello to my wife, Madeline, who is a lawyer at the Guardian?\" asks Chris Goodgame. \"She's the lovely one with brown wavy hair.\" \"You guys are a bunch of wimps, try spending a winter up in Goose Bay Labrador!\" - Andy G. Half-time: 46 min: We're off again. Surely the second half can't be as bad as the first? Please? Meanwhile this from Dave Baxter: \"I don't know what all these Yankees are bleating about,\" he writes. \"I live in Canada and they don't call it the 'Great White North' for nothing. Go Porto!\" 47 min: Oh, while I remember: United have made a change - Louis Saha on for the injured Djemba-Djemba. 48 min: Porto attack! Carlos Alberto finds Maniche, 20 yards out, and he unleashes a corker - only for The Wes Brown Comedy Experience to make a brave and successful block. \"Am I the only one who's giggling in a very juvenile way at the phrase 'the ball pinballs around Porto's box'?\" asks Simon Blake. Hmm, think you are Simon. 51 min: Another Porto chance: Alenitchev's cross finds Carlos Alberto, who expertly brings it down before striking the ball with his studs. It trundles along, not particularly quickly, before trickling just wide - with the out-of-position Howard struggling. 53 min: United are still defending deep, looking to hit Porto on the break. It's working so far, but considering their defensive woes of recent weeks, it's surely a risky strategy. 56 min: A rare United attack ends when Van Nistelrooy strays offside. \"As a transplanted Yorkshireman, all I can say is ... Goose Bay! Luxury! We used to live in Fort McMurray, Albert,\" says David Baker. Any advances on Fort McMurray? Someone from the North Pole, perhaps? 58 min: United aren't looking at all convincing - Porto have had 57% of possession to United's 43%, and Nicky Butt keeps getting caught on the ball. Mark my words: this game isn't won yet... 60 min: It's as you were: Porto pressing, United backing off. Scholes has just gone studs high on Pedro Emanuel, which means he'll miss the next match if United go through. \"Last week it was Cuban cigar shops, now its bloody upstate New York antique shops. Cut out the plugs!\" fumes Simon Blake. \"PS can you say hi to the great guys at The Dark Horse in Philly for helping to keep us all sane.\" Do I look like I do requests, Simon? 62 min: Porto sub: Carlos Alberto off, Jankauskas on. 64 min: A rare United attack nearly pays off as Baia comes for a Fletcher cross, misses horribly, and Carvalho - who doesn't seem to know where he is - heads it over his own bar. But United can't take advantage of the resulting corner. 67 min: Better from United, who - for the first time in God knows how long - are actually going forward. Fletcher pings in a cross, but Saha and Van Nistelrooy both go for it and it spills feebly into Baia's hands. 70 min: So close - at both ends! First United sweep the length of the pitch - Fletcher finding Scholes, who dinks it to Van Nistelrooy, who delays for too long and has his shot blocked. Then Porto race forward and Alenitchev's dipper (note to Simon Blake, not a double entendre) flies just inches over the crossbar. 72 min: It's [tired clich\u00e9 from tired minute-by-minute hack alert] end-to-end stuff now - Louis Saha's just had a 25-yard curler charged down. You certainly wouldn't back against their being more goals... 74 min: Maniche stamps nastily on Scholes shin - it was far worse than Roy Keane's on Baia's two weeks ago - yet gets away with a booking. Meanwhile Jorge Arai wants everyone to know that it's 24 degrees in Sydney. 75 min: United sub: Fletcher off, Ronaldo on. 78 min: It's all gone a bit scrappy, United are not overpressing and Porto aren't yet going all guns blazing. \"Fort McMurray? Luxury!\" says Geoff Woods. \"There were 150 of us living in a shoe-box in t'middle of t'road in Churchill, Manitoba.\" 80 min: Surprise, surprise: it's taken just four minutes for Ronaldo to go down. The referee obviously thinks he's dived, and waves play on, but replays shows that Alenitchev tripped him. Play eventually stops and the young Portugeezer is able to get treatment. 81 min: Porto sub: Alenitchev off, Ricardo Fernandes on. 82 min: United sub: Ronaldo isn't able to continue, and six minutes after coming on he's replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who incidentally turned 30 last week. 84 min: Not good news for United fans as a sorry-looking Ronaldo is carted away on a stretcher. Still, it's broken up play and wasted a few valuable minutes. Can United hang on? 86 min: Ryan Giggs rampages down the left, almost like the Ryan Giggs of old, swerving this way and that - jink! jink! swerve! swerve! - but his cross goes about 10 foot over Van Nistelrooys head and into Baia's arms. 88 min: You keep expecting the Porto charge, but it hasn't come. They're whacking it long now at every opportunity - and the Wes Brown Comedy Experience is dealing with it better than United fans dared hoped. 89 min: Wait a second. Phil Neville's just conceded a soft free-kick 25 yards out in Beckham territory... 90 min: .... oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Howard's had a touch of the Barthezs - McCarthy's free-kick looks saveable but the American can only palm it out, straight to Costinha, who slots it home. It's 1-1 and Porto are going through. 90 min +1: United steam frantically forward and Valente clears one off the line! Amazing Clive Tyldesley hasn't yet mentioned that win against Bayern in 1999. We have three minutes of injury time. 90 min + 3 For two minutes, United whack long ball after long ball into the Porto box. Each time it gets cleared. Finally, after four minutes of injury time (the three allowed minutes and the extra one Sir Alex is entitled to) the referee blows up. FULL-TIME That's it! Game over. Porto are through, United are out. And the angry boos are enveloping Old Trafford. Fergie's face is a picture, I can tell you. He's chewing that gum faster than ever. United fans will rightly point to Scholes second goal that was wrongly disallowed - but on balance Porto probably just about deserved it. Thanks for all your emails, Sean.
