It marked back-to-back wins for Victoria, following success for Best\u2019s Great Western Bin 1 shiraz 2011 last year. It was a notable evening for the state across the board, with Victorian pinot, chardonnay, old-vine marsanne, sparkling, and fortified wines taking nine of a possible 22 trophies. For those who view Victoria as a minor piece in Australia\u2019s wine jigsaw \u2013 and there are a few \u2013 it underlines that the state produces some very decent wines. Not that it\u2019s easy to sum up Victorian wine: it\u2019s a fragmented and deeply diverse vineyard, with a greater number of wineries and discrete regions than any other state. That\u2019s bad for brand identity, but good news for adventurous drinkers. Those prepared to forgive chardonnay its past sins or take a punt on pricier pinot will find plenty of interest, while from Heathcote to Sunbury, Beechworth to Bendigo, shiraz proves itself to be much more than a one-trick pony. Rutherglen\u2019s luscious topaques and muscats are justifiably famous. Plus there\u2019s plenty of scope to flirt with foreigners such as prosecco, arneis and sangiovese from the Italian-accented King Valley. Fashion, among drinkers and judges, has played a role in Victoria\u2019s changing fortunes. Coolness is, well, cool these days. While high-octane blockbusters were once de rigueur, the talk across the tasting bench these days revolves around how grape variety and vineyard find true expression only at lower alcohols. So Victoria\u2019s cool-climate regions are a hot ticket \u2013 and will only become more so in a warming world. The star is steadily rising for the Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley, while the likes of Macedon, Geelong and Gippsland are emerging from obscurity. Of course Morris, whose Grand Reserve Liqueur Muscat won best fortified, and Tahbilk, who took best varietal white for its glorious 1927 Vines marsanne, are no strangers to the winners\u2019 podium. But newer Victorian wineries are also producing intense, complex, distinctive and ageworthy wines, proving they aren\u2019t mere vanity projects for cashed-up lawyers and doctors. It\u2019s not the case that those arriving late to the wine scene always have less to lose and therefore show less devotion to quality. Yabby Lake is a case in point. Founded by the Kirbys \u2013 the family behind Village Roadshow \u2013 it has built a formidable reputation since its inception in 1998. Crafted from a small section of a little vineyard in Moorooduc, its Jimmy-winning Block 1 pinot could be the big future of Australian wine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
