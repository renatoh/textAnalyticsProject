The BBC's world news editor, Jon Williams, warned that the BBC has a \"corporate blind spot\" over its lack of working-class employees. And the BBC diversity editorial executive, Mary Fitzpatrick, argued that Britain had \"changed hugely in the last 10 or 20 years and ... we need to reflect that different audience with a wider range of voices\". Race and class dominated several sessions at the BBC internal news and sport festival last week. Home editor Mark Easton said too many journalists ignored popular subjects such as immigration issues and paedophiles, instead seeing \"the world through the Westminster prism\". Moscow correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes joked that he was \"an example of everything that's wrong with the BBC\" in that he was a \"white, middle-class man with a posh name, from Sussex\". Staff also discussed \"the unreachables\", the young or less well-educated audience who do not often watch the BBC. Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt said the BBC needed to \"engage\" more with the two-thirds of 16- to 24-year-olds who rarely watch a BBC bulletin, according to the corporation's in-house magazine Ariel. But BBC deputy director general Mark Byford warned the corporation against too much self-flagellation, saying some people will \"always be unreachables\". \"If we chase every group with the aim of converting them as an audience, then we could run the risk of losing the core audience we already hold. There will always be some unreachables,\" Mr Byford added. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
