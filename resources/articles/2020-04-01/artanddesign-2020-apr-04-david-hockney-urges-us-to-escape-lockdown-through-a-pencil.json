Coronavirus shut the world down when Hockney was in France, living in the Normandy countryside. He is occupying himself there depicting the natural world. This week the release of some of his iPad paintings of spring flowers and blossoms splashed joyous colours in a time of grey anxiety. \u201cWe need art, and I do think it can relieve stress,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is stress? It\u2019s worrying about something in the future. Art is now.\u201d At a time when more and more people are enjoying walks, time in the garden, or just relishing the short periods they can spend outdoors, Hockney\u2019s new iPad paintings of Normandy advocate encountering nature for escape, solace and renewal. They\u2019re a timely culmination of a life spent looking at trees, flowers and skies. Even in one of his most famous works, A Bigger Splash, he paid close attention to LA\u2019s palms and lawns. \u201cI have always disliked crowds,\u201d confessed Hockney the Romantic. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because of my hearing problems. And I like solitude. I am very aware we are part of nature.\u201d Has the coronavirus crisis made us more open to solitary reveries and serious art? \u201cI think at the moment it\u2019s making people think a bit deeper about life. But perhaps it\u2019s my age. I\u2019m 83 (nearly).\u201d Hockney has a passion for nature that rejoices in British rain just as much as French sunshine. His current project returns to the open-air landscape technique he used in Yorkshire a few years ago after he moved from LA to Bridlington. \u201cRuskin said there was no such thing as bad weather in England. I remember being in Bridlington one winter evening when the weather forecast was on. They told us not to go out as there was going to be a terrible snow storm. This made me sit up and I suggested we go out to see it,\u201d he said in a succession of email exchanges. \u201cWe got in our four-wheel-drive truck and drove slowly to Woldgate, not very far and we only went up it about half a mile, and then we stopped. The headlights from the car lit up the snow very dramatically and we watched the snow forming on the tree branches. It was magical, I thought, really memorable.\u201d However gentle Hockney\u2019s spring blossoms may seem, this story reveals he may have something in him of Turner, who once got himself lashed to a mast in a storm. And that awe drives his artistic struggle. \u201cTo depict nature, we can only try. Nature doesn\u2019t have any straight lines. It doesn\u2019t follow the rules of perspective.\u201d This freedom from human rules is what makes a motif such as the tree he\u2019s just sent me such a boundless theme: every pale dapple of blossom, every twist and turn of a branch is unique. Drawing nature is sheer adventure: \u201cIt makes us see things. This is why photography is a problem ... with cameras everything is pushed away. I was just drawing a tree this morning and Jonathan [his assistant] made a photograph of it ... my drawing got the space a lot better.\u201d Hockney is on a roll right now, painting in the open every day, and as he makes picture after picture he sees these unassuming acts of observation coming together as an epic panorama. \u201cWhat I am doing here is eventually to make my iPad drawings into something like the Bayeux tapestry, ie you will walk past it. The Bayeux tapestry is 90 metres long. It contains no shadows, no reflections and certainly no perspective as that would stop time. It would look very odd. Bayeux is 40 minutes\u2019 drive from here. In European art history it is ignored. Why? It is like a Chinese scroll: very sophisticated. In a book I read recently called 1066, the author dismissed it as cartoonish. I concluded he wasn\u2019t very visual.\u201d David Hockney is an artist who thinks deeply and widely about what he\u2019s doing and his apparently simple pictures of spring blooms are anything but. They\u2019re philosophical investigations of what it is to see something fully and \u201cdepict\u201d it \u2013 his chosen word \u2013 with an intimacy the camera can\u2019t give. If his art is urgent now, it\u2019s not because it is bright and cheery. It is because it is still and pensive. After he mentioned Ruskin, who looked for God in nature, I could not help asking him about his own beliefs. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, but he felt \u201clike Van Gogh, who knew nature was a great mystery to us\u201d. It\u2019s a mystery he\u2019s teaching us to see freshly and find strength in. \u201cThis morning is cloudy here and there has been some frost that affects the blossom a bit, but I\u2019ll find something to draw.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
