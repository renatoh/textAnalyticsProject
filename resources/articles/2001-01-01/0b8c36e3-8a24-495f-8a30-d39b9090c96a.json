Saturday was my last day in Singapore and I crammed in as much as possible. First it was off to Sentosa Island. Theme parks aren't really my scene, but I wanted to go on the cable car ride from Mount Faber to the Island which gave an aerial view over Singapore. I walked the neat nature trail halfway round the island, then took the monorail - with the inevitable synchonised commentary - round the rest. This was enough and I caught the ferry back. Off then to Jurong bird park which was enjoyable, with flocks of pink flamingos and aviaries of brightly coloured forest birds, although I didn't relish seeing huge eagles and a condor in cages, however big. I had my first taste of magueritas out of jam jars with Dan that evening - powerful stuff. On Sunday I flew to Kuching in Sarawak to be met by Steven, my son's girlfriend's uncle. Steven, Jennifer (his wife) and their four children have been the most wonderful hosts, helping to plan trips for me, ferrying me about, and giving me a real taste of Malay life and food. Noodles with meat and soup for breakfast took a bit of getting used to but I managed it as well as many of the local Chinese dishes with unfamiliar ingredients. Playing Monopoly with the streets of Kuala Lumpur on the board was also interesting. Kuching is a lovely city with a delightful riverwalk adorned with coloured fountains and flower beds. We took a 'tambang' - a little ferry - across and down the river. Across the road is a line of shops stuffed with Borneo artifacts. The city is full of Chinese and Malay food markets with fruit and vegetables I have never seen before. I visited some of the excellent museums although unfortunately the unique Cat Museum was shut on the day I was wandering about. On Tuesday it was off for an overnight stay at the Bako National Park. A real adventure. Accessible only by boat, I was somewhat taken aback to be given a life jacket. There followed a 20 minute ride crashing through high waves with sea horses on them, and being drenched by spray. Exciting stuff! The park was beautiful, with stunning empty beaches, the forest at times meeting the sea. This is what I had come for. I chose a trail of five kilometres or so that looked manageable and set off. Within minutes I was deep in the rainforest, drenched with sweat, completely alone (except for Bruce, of course) splashing through streams and clambering over tree roots. The only sound was the continuous hum and whine of insect life. I was lost in wonder, feeling like Dr Livingstone, Margaret Mead and Harrison Ford all in one. OK, the trails were marked and there were wooden planks across swampy bits, but it still felt totally real and raw. When I reached high points the views took my breath away. The only problem was that I had drunk half my water by the time I was only a quarter of the way and had to begin rationing it. In the deepest part of the forest it was so dense that it became dark. Water dripped everywhere and the rocks and trees were covered in thick moss. Here even the insects stopped their noise. I have never experienced such complete silence, felt so close to ancient nature at its richest, or so far from civilisation. I will never forget that feeling. Late afternoon I was rewarded by the sight of proboscis monkeys swinging high in the trees. Magic. Dirty, drenched to the skin, tired and a little dehydrated, I arrived back at the lodge after six of the best hours of my life. That evening there was a terrific thunderstorm with torrential rain. I sheltered in the canteen spending a pleasant evening talking to a couple from Cairns in Australia. I returned to the lodge to find my bag of rolls empty, despite meshed windows and a locked door, I can only guess that a very tiny macaque monkey had squeezed through the narrow slats above the windows, neatly untied the plastic bag and enjoyed my breakfast. The next morning for the first time, I met an English couple who had actually seen the Netjetters website back in England. It felt exciting and strange, especially as there were only about half a dozen tourists in total at the park! After a short walk in the morning, spotting more monkeys, and another hair-raising boat ride, it was back to Kuching. The following day I was off again - this time to the heritage park where they have rebuilt examples of the different tribal longhouses, which are fast disappearing from East Malaysia. People from the different tribes were cooking or weaving or making musical instruments in the traditional ways. Although it was manufactured, the combination of the setting and the enthusiasm with which the people demonstrated what they were doing made the experience fascinating and informative. I had a go with a blowpipe but missed the target. With a tennis racquet it would have been different. Later there was a show of the different tribal music and dancing, which was excellent. Steven had promised me 'an experience ' that evening and we went off to a Chinese 'trance' session. Certain people are chosen to house the spirits in trance and their homes are turned into small Chinese temples. I was shown all the statues of the many gods in alcoves around the temple and we waited an hour while people gradually gathered, lighting hundreds of eye-watering incense sticks as they came, and preparing offerings of fruit for the gods. It was the elephant god that was to enter the young man in a trance that night, so offerings of bananas and milk were made. Then there was a session of smashing coconuts on the ground while you made a wish for your luck to change, and finally the man entered the trance. He began shaking and then making elephant noises which the band of followers crowded round him tried to interpret. He then slowly forced a large steel hook right through his cheek and out of his mouth, which he left there for about 20 minutes. When the spirit finally left he collapsed, and they had to try to revive him and find out which god had now entered him. On finding out, they dressed him in the appropriate robes and he sat on a chair of sharp nails with his feet resting on blades. He now blessed amulets and people asked him for help with problems. We then left. I really don't know what to make of it all. I saw the hook go in and come out without a mark. Steven had also made me feel the nails through the chair seat before it started. I will just leave it there for you as a description of an experience. So this is my last day in Kuching. Tomorrow I am off to Sibu and on to Miri and the Gunung Mulu National Park and then across to Kuala Lumpur and the peninsular. I do not know how to thank the Phua family, Steven, Jennifer and the lovely children Ceasar, Cheryl, Ben and Daryl, (who now all call me Aunty Sue) for making my stay here so wonderful. I can only hope that one day they will come to stay in England so I can return their hospitality. My schedule next week is very tight - journeys were difficult to book because of the Chinese new year when everyone travels to visit their families. I will endeavour to find myself in an internet caf\u00e9 next Friday but it may be difficult in the remoter regions of north Sarawak so there is a chance it may be late. All my weeks have been varied and exciting but this one maybe most of all. If this keeps up I'll be in experience overload. I can only hope that I am managing to convey a taste of my wonderful time to you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
