Families bereaved last spring when a passenger train derailed as it travelled through the station in Hertfordshire, killing seven and injuring 76, have been refused legal aid to pursue Railtrack and the maintenance contractors Jarvis for damages. But they have been given hope by the announcement last week that the Omagh families - who had also been turned down for legal aid - will now get state funding to pursue a civil case against five men they believe were responsible for the IRA atrocity. The Potters Bar group's lawyer, Louise Christian, said she is now seeking meetings with Cabinet Ministers to appeal for similar mercy to be shown to them. 'I think everybody would welcome the funding for the victims of Omagh, but the victims of Potters Bar have also been refused legal aid and refused conditional fee insurance,' said Christian. 'They are being denied access to justice. I think if you are involved in a major disaster and bereaved or injured, you don't expect to have to pay for legal fees.' Ministers had hesitated over signing a blank cheque for the Omagh families, for fear of setting a precedent. But they decided the bombing was an extraordinary case. The Government was also embarrassed by the revelation that two of the defendants in the Omagh case were receiving legal aid while the families had been refused. The case is expected to cost up to \u00a3800,000. Christian said the Potters Bar group would need only a fraction of that sum, basing their case on the recent Health and Safety Executive report into the crash which concluded poor track maintenance, management failings and communications errors caused the derailment. Jarvis reacted angrily to the suggestion, accusing the HSE of being 'politically motivated' and lacking evidence to back up its case. It has insisted that the points which caused the derailment may have been sabotaged by vandals. 'There are extremely strong public interest elements in this case,' Christian said. 'As long as Railtrack and Jarvis refuse to accept that they were to blame nobody can be confident that they have put things right.' Railtrack announced last year it would pay out to the Potters Bar victims, even though it did not accept it had been negligent. But Christian says the offers now being made to the families are not enough. 'The daughters of Agnes Quinlivan, the elderly lady who died, have been offered only \u00a310,000, yet in other disasters the payouts in a similar situation have been well over the legal minimum,' she said. 'This is also reflected in Railtrack's dealings with injured people - it is taking an aggressive attitude to the litigation. If legal aid is refused by the Legal Services Commission - which makes its decision based on the claimants' income and merits of the case - the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, does have powers to override the decision in exceptional circumstances and order it to be paid. Christian is now writing to Falconer and the Transport Secretary, Alistair Darling, requesting urgent meetings to review the Potters Bar families' case in the light of the Omagh ruling. The Crown Prosecution Service is due to report this autumn on whether anyone will face criminal charges over the Potters Bar crash."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
