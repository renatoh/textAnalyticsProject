A record 580 viewers have contacted the independent television commission to complain since the ad, for Wrigley's X-cite chewing gum, went on air at the weekend. Millions of viewers would have seen the advert, which was screened during Sunday's episode of Cold Feet and subsequently aired during Coronation Street, which is currently attracting 15 million viewers. The commercial shows a man waking up on a sofa after a heavy night out. When he wretches, a paw emerges from his mouth - followed by a scruffy grey dog. Parents complained that the graphic scene, which is accompanied by the warning \"avoid dog breath\", was frightening their children and making them feel sick. A spokeswoman for the ITC said the watchdog would investigate the complaints. \"We have been flooded with complaints, and the total is rising all the time,\" she said. \"Parents have been complaining that their children are scared by it, and some of the adults have said they were actually sick themselves after watching it.\" Wrigley's has now agreed to restrict the advert to programmes shown after the 9pm watershed. \"Millions of viewers have seen the advert and only a minute percentage have complained. While we are disappointed that even this tiny percentage did not like the ad, we are pragmatic in the realisation that it is almost impossible to create an advertisement that is engaging and powerful that everyone enjoys,\" the company said in a statement. The previous record was held by a Levi's advert showing Kevin, a hamster that died of boredom after his wheel broke. The advert was banned just days after it first appeared on air following 544 complaints. The outcry was so great that Kevin's owner was forced to make a public statement assuring distressed viewers that the animal was alive and well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
