Australia's captain, Ricky Ponting, is eager for another surface to suit his aggressive fast bowlers, and negate England's off-spinner Graeme Swann, after their crushing 267-run win in Perth levelled the Ashes series at 1-1 with two to play. \u2022 Interactive guide to all the Ashes venues \u2022 Sign up now for our weekly email The Spin \u2022 How to stay awake during the Tests \u2022 Follow our daily blog throughout the Ashes \u2022 The latest news and comment on our Ashes site Flower is determined to question the notion that England can only defeat Australia on benign surfaces. He repeatedly quotes Old Trafford as a pitch where England have proved they can play pace, and he could also refer to the fact that England beat Pakistan last summer, when the ball swung and seamed throughout, whereas Australia lost to Pakistan at Headingley. \"We won't see similar conditions in Melbourne because it is not as quick and it doesn't bounce as much there,\" Flower said. \"I thought the curator at Perth did a really good job. I thought it was an excellent pitch as I did the Adelaide pitch, which deteriorated nicely. This made for really exciting cricket. \"If they prepare a pitch with bounce and a bit in it for the bowlers that will make it a good contest in Melbourne; that's what they should be doing as it makes for a good spectacle. When we were there for the three-day game they were preparing two pitches. One looked barer than the other and we expected then that they would go with the one with more grass cover.\" Although Melbourne's drop-in pitches cannot remotely match the Waca's bounce and pace the MCG groundsman, Cameron Hodgkins, opted last week to abandon his original surface in favour of a back-up. Greg Shipperd, Victoria's coach, blames the weather. \"We've had such an unusual summer this year that the grass has spent a lot of time under covers,\" he said. \"There are different grass types on the wickets and it has certainly affected some grasses more than others. \"The wicket Cameron is targeting has a nice, consistent covering of grass on it. How much grass he leaves on is up to him. The pitch will provide a bit of early assistance if he leaves some leaf on it. It swings, bounces a bit and it usually plays well at the back end of the game. That's a typical MCG wicket. I wouldn't have thought we could replicate the Waca, though. It's well off the pace of a wicket in Perth or Brisbane.\" Australia's groundsmen are normally fiercely independent but attitudes might have changed slightly after The Oval groundsman, Bill Gordon, made no secret in 2009 of his delight about a dry, dusty surface on which England won the Ashes and Swann took eight wickets. England would have preferred Hodgkins to stick to the original Test pitch, which would have suited Swann and might also have encouraged the reverse swing of Ajmal Shahzad, whose confidence when bowling at left-handers makes him a potential selection."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
