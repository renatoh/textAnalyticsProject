Tarang Chawla spoke of the brutal murder of his sister Nikita by her husband last year before asking the ABC talk show panel how \u201cpoliticians and the media can play a better role in bringing about long overdue cultural shifts so tragedies like what happened to my family are not normalised\u201d. Chawla prefaced his question by referring to the controversy around Eddie McGuire\u2019s comments about \u201cdrowning\u201d journalist Caroline Wilson and Sam Newman\u2019s defence of McGuire. This prompted Price to again defend McGuire\u2019s role in the episode, saying \u201cEddie apologised immediately\u201d and that \u201ctoo much was made of what was originally a joke on a football show\u201d. A heated exchange that followed with Van Badham, a Guardian Australia columnist, provided the audience with the most provocative segment of the panel talk show. Topics canvassed before this ranged from the vulnerability of the newly elected prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to the foundations of Labor\u2019s \u201cMediscare\u201d campaign and whether the UK\u2019s Chilcot inquiry showed parliament not cabinet should decide when to send Australia to war. Badham told Price that \u201cwhat you see as jokes made by a bunch of blokes \u2026 from the position of being one of those blokes who\u2019s probably been in on some of those jokes, I see as a woman who is part of a social world where violence is\u201d. Price interrupted to ask she \u201cretract\u201d any suggestion \u201cI have been in on one of those jokes\u201d before agreeing he had described McGuire and others as \u201ca bunch of blokes joking round and making apologies\u201d. This was \u201cfact\u201d, he said, adding: \u201cDon\u2019t tar me with their brush, please.\u201d Badham asked Price if he had \u201cany understanding what you\u2019re doing\u201d. \u201cThis man has given us an extremely upsetting story about something that\u2019s happened and you are defending yourself in the context where we have to have a conversation about cultural attitudes that treat women differently,\u201d she said. Price provoked visible audience disquiet \u2013 including from Chawla \u2013 by telling Badham: \u201cJust because you\u2019re a woman, you\u2019re not the only person who can get upset about this.\u201d Badham in turn received audience applause by telling Price: \u201cYou are proving my point very excellently about the attitudes that create this kind of problem.\u201d She said gender construction relegated women to lower status and \u201cthat we can make jokes and it\u2019s all jokes and, oh yeah, they apologised and that\u2019s fine but on the receiving end is the ludicrous proportion of women who do endure violence\u201d. Price said Badham was \u201cjust being hysterical\u201d, prompting gasps from the audience and her riposte: \u201cIt is probably my ovaries making me do it, Steve.\u201d Chawla told Price he found some of his comments \u201crather offensive considering that you\u2019re essentially sticking up for people making misogynist comments and passing them off as joking and banter\u201d. \u201cDo you not see yourself as having the ability to normalise views around gender equality? If so, how would you go about doing that?\u201d Price, in a belated response to Chawla\u2019s mention of his sister\u2019s murder, said he felt \u201csorry for your personal circumstances but we can go too far in taking someone like a media personality and stringing them up\u201d. \u201cEddie McGuire apologised, that should have been the end of the matter,\u201d he said. The Coalition\u2019s leader in the Senate, George Brandis, earlier defended the government\u2019s election campaign amid questions over Turnbull\u2019s ability to prevent an internal Liberal party split over lingering resentment among conservatives over Tony Abbott\u2019s dumping. Brandis said he was confident the Coalition would secure a 77-seat majority, which was a \u201crelatively narrow win but it is a clear win\u201d. Price said his mainly conservative radio listeners resented the dumping of Abbott while the government\u2019s proposed winding back of superannuation tax concessions had divided the Liberal support base. He said there was \u201ca very real split\u201d in the Liberal party and Turnbull needed to play \u201cpeacemaker\u201d by bringing Abbott \u201cback into the fold\u201d. Brandis said Abbott was in the fold as an \u201celder statesman\u201d of the party with \u201ca lot to contribute\u201d and there was no evidence he would undermine Turnbull. The deputy opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, was forced to defend Labor\u2019s campaign on the chances of Liberal dismantling or privatising further elements of Medicare, which the new Victorian senator elect Derryn Hinch described as \u201cbullshit\u201d. Hinch said fellow senator elect Pauline Hanson had drawn votes by playing to \u201canti-Muslim fears\u201d rather than the economic insecurity of her base. \u201cPauline Hanson and I have two things in common ... that\u2019s just about all \u2014 one, we\u2019ve both been to prison and, two, we\u2019ve both been on Dancing with the Stars,\u201d he said. An Iraqi migrant, Michael Youssef, asked the panel what the US, UK and Australian governments should do \u201capart from apologise\u201d in the wake of deaths in the Middle East following the toppling of Saddam Hussein. He later said, regardless of the pretext, the dictator\u2019s removal was welcomed by the Iraqi people who had experienced oppression under his reign."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
