Here are six key takeaways: The \u2018policy dispute\u2019 defense The president\u2019s defense argued on Monday that Trump\u2019s conduct toward Ukraine did not stem from a desire to smear the former vice-president Joe Biden, but from Trump\u2019s personal concerns about corruption in Ukraine and burden-sharing with Europe. Trump\u2019s lawyers sought to cast the furore over his Ukraine conduct as a policy dispute. \u201cTo have a removal of a president based on a policy dispute? That\u2019s not what the framers intended,\u201d said Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Jay Sekulow. Gliding past Bolton But on Tuesday the defense went further, to argue that even if everything reportedly charged in a forthcoming book by the former national security adviser John Bolton is true \u2013 that Trump conditioned military aid for Ukraine on the receipt by him of personal political favors \u2013 that would still not be impeachable. \u201cEven if everything in there was true, it constitutionally doesn\u2019t rise to that level\u201d of an impeachable offense, said Sekulow. Republican Mike Braun of Indiana made the case off the Senate floor: Can I get a witness? Probably not. Sekulow argued that reports about Bolton\u2019s book were \u201cinadmissible\u201d as hearsay, but the defense team simultaneously argued that no witnesses should be called. That\u2019s not how the public feels about it, however, according to opinion polls conducted in the past week, including one released by Quinnipiac on Tuesday: Time to spare. Lots of it Trump\u2019s defense was spread across three days, but the first and third days were short ones \u2013 an intro on Saturday and an outro on Tuesday. All told, the defense used about 10 of its 24 hours allotted for opening arguments \u2013 less than half the time House managers used to present evidence against Trump. Questions are next The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said the Senate would convene at 1pm Wednesday to begin a question period, which could last for a maximum of 16 hours spread over two days. Senators will submit written questions to be read by the supreme court\u2019s chief justice, John Roberts, who encouraged the counsels on Tuesday to limit their responses to five minutes apiece. Big day on Friday The Senate was on track to hold at least one major vote on Friday, on the question of whether to vote on individual witnesses. If the Senate decides against witnesses, then the big vote \u2013 whether to convict or acquit the president \u2013 could follow soon after. If Trump has his way, the impeachment process could be concluded by the weekend, well in advance of his State of the Union address scheduled on Tuesday 4 February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
