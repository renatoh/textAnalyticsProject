The commercial for Pepsi Max features a chimp driving a man around in a taxi and was created by the advertising agency behind a Halfords advert that used chimps and was ultimately withdrawn after an outcry from animal rights groups. The Captive Animals Protection Society (CAPS) - an organisation that campaigns on behalf of animals in the entertainment industry - said it has been in talks with Pepsi about the ad over the past week and if the ad is not withdrawn it will have no alternative but to organise a consumer boycott of the Pepsi brand. \"All Pepsi has said so far is a very basic, standard reply saying it filmed the ad in Spain, that a trainer was used and that the four-year-old chimp's welfare needs were met,\" said Craig Redmond, campaign officer for CAPS. \"But that doesn't get over our opposition to the use of wild animals in ads. A four-year-old chimp should still be with its family. It hasn't even reached adolescence yet. \"Boycotts can't be called lightly. But if Pepsi refuses to pull the ad and stop using great apes in ads we will call a boycott if it's the only way people can get their message across that this is not acceptable,\" said Mr Redmond. Pepsi insisted the welfare of the animal had been paramount and there was no need to withdraw the advert. \"The chimpanzee was supervised throughout the shoot by her trainer who has many years of specialised experience. In addition, we ensured that we obtained written certification from a vet confirming that the animal was in good health. \"The commercial was then approved by the advertising regulators. We would like to reassure you that throughout the production, the chimpanzee was treated in a gentle, caring manner.\" Ad agency used chimps before However some sources close to the company say they can't believe Pepsi has used animals, given the storms of protest that have greeted similar campaigns in the past. But the advertising agency that created the commercial might have guessed it would cause a backlash. French agency CLM.BBDO is part of the Abbot Mead Vickers.BBDO group, which was the agency behind an ad featuring chimps for Halfords which had to be withdrawn after protests. Last year sportswear company Puma was also forced withdraw an advert that featured a chimpanzee wearing a nappy, after renowned scientist Dr Jane Goodall joined with more than 30 animal rights groups to condemn it. \"Chimpanzees and other apes suffer horribly for society's entertainment,\" said Dr Goodall, who rose to fame through her conservation work with chimpanzees in Africa. \"It is time to move beyond the misuse of creatures who are vulnerable to our exploitation precisely because they are so like us.\" But Puma vigorously defended the advert, saying it had been cleared by the American Humane Society and the New York office of PETA, the animal rights group. But PETA denied it had had any contact with Puma. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
