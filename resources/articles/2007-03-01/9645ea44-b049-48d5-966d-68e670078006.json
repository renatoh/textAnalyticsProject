A few months ago, for instance, when Katherine Rake challenged well-known figures to be pictured in a \"This is what a feminist looks like\" T-shirt, she wasn't at all sure what the response would be. Enthusiasm, ambivalence, boredom, hostility? Over the years, the \"feminist\" label has, after all, become rather loaded. In the late 60s and early 70s, it was genuinely cool to identify as a feminist (imagine!), but a significant backlash changed all that. The word became a source of parody, with characters such as Viz magazine's \"Millie Tant\" stripping away the word's actual meaning and making it synonymous instead with misandry and various quirks of appearance: hairy armpits, dungarees, bralessness. In a recent G2 interview, American singer Kelis summed up this view, explaining that she didn't call herself a feminist, because \"there's a really negative connotation with the word ... generally that we hate men - you know, we don't shave our legs\". Rake, director of the UK's leading equality campaign, the Fawcett Society, could have been forgiven some pessimism. In the event, though, she was happily surprised by how many people were prepared to stick \"two fingers up to the stigma attached to the 'feminist' label. Many celebrities are more than happy to call themselves feminists, and to explain what the word means to them. The writer Tracy Chevalier, for example, says that \"feminism means giving women the same opportunities as men. Simple as that\", while newscaster Samira Ahmed admits \"Feminist is the first word I'd use to describe myself.\" The writer Sarah Waters suggests, \"Surely the real question should be not 'Why are you a feminist?' but 'Why aren't you one?'\" Why not, indeed? Although only a small part of the picture, the campaign helps confirm the sense that feminism is reaching another turning point, retaining its core supporters and finding a host of new ones. Just last month, for instance, a report by Girlguiding UK found significant awareness of sexual inequality among the group's older members, with 63% of 16- to 25-year-olds saying that equality has not yet been achieved. Unsurprisingly, 65% said they would not be embarrassed to be called feminists. Then there are all the brilliant young feminist websites that have sprung up, including the UK's own F-word website, which runs an opinionated daily blog. Perhaps the most successful of the US websites, Feministing.com, is run by Jessica Valenti, who is soon to publish Full Frontal Feminism, a book explaining just why young women should get involved in the movement. In a recent interview, Charlotte Church described herself as a \"raving feminist\", while Beth Ditto, of US rock band the Gossip, has been hugely outspoken, and rewarded not with censure, but with the number one spot on last year's NME cool list. \"What's really interesting,\" says Rake, \"is that a younger generation of women are really reclaiming the word. They're coming to traditional feminist issues via various routes - reacting to the hypersexualisation of culture, for instance, or to rising levels of violence. Women, and especially younger women (hopefully some young men too), are waking up to what a big journey is still to come. We really are at the beginning of a new wave.\" Rake's campaign has attracted a few critics. In Wednesday's issue of the Independent, for instance, columnist Deborah Orr suggested that the campaign was superficial, telling us something we already know - that feminists come in all ages and genders - without telling us much about what today's feminists actually think. Rake agrees that the campaign could be seen as superficial, if it wasn't for the fact that \"underneath it is a whole set of very concrete demands and facts about the inequalities still faced by women. The Fawcett Society is campaigning to close the gaps between men and women as far as access to power, money and justice are concerned. Yesterday, we held an event with Gordon Brown, so we are speaking directly to the heart of power.\" Given the decades of stigma, getting more people signed up to the F-word seems no small thing, and, for those who want to take things further, there are already hundreds, if not thousands, of campaigns for women's rights all across the country. Feminist thought has always been hugely varied - a movement for the rights of over half the human race could never be a model of unanimity. Whether someone's feminism leads them to fight for equal pay, freedom from violence, more women in parliament, or all these and more, taking pride in the word \"feminist\" is always a necessary starting point. Who would Rake most like to see in the T-shirts? She laughs. \"I think it would be wonderful if the leaders of all the major political parties would come out wearing one. That would a great cross-party statement.\" Come on guys, you heard her ..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
