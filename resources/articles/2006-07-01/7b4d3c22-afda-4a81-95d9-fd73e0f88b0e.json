The Israelis have learned the lesson of 1982 by not mounting a ground invasion of Lebanon. At that time, Sharon disobeyed cabinet orders to clear a 40km swathe of territory of Palestinian fighters and marched on Beirut instead. The war in 1982 was marked by duplicity from the outset, when Begin used the attempted assassination of the Israeli ambassador in London to remove PLO military forces from southern Lebanon. Unlike the current situation, a ceasefire had been in place, which the PLO honoured, and the organisation was not in possession of long-range missiles. In 1982, Israel did attempt regime change through a tacit alliance with the new Lebanese president, Bashir Gemayel. In this case, the Israelis are fearful of toppling the Lebanese government. Unlike 1982, the political consensus in Israel has not been broken and is reflected by the miniscule turnout for anti-war demonstrations. The broad peace camp differentiates between the Palestinian issue and the evacuation of settlements - and military initiatives by Hizbullah, which they see as an Islamist appendage of Iranian imperialism which has little interest in locating a just solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Dr Colin Shindler Soas, University of London David Grossman injects a much-needed note of realism into the escalating conflict. I have been receiving regular updates over this past week from Baptists in both Lebanon and northern Israel. They hold no truck with Hizbullah, but both groups are agreed that the Israeli response has been grossly disproportionate and is destroying the Lebanon which was so painstakingly rebuilt over the past 15 years. If it is right that our government is following the US in \"allowing\" Israel to destroy Hizbullah, then, leaving aside the question of whether this is actually possible, the human price has simply become too high to continue this policy. One-third of the victims on both sides are children. Our Beirut Baptist school, like many others, is overrun with refugees in urgent need of food and medical help. To pursue the policy of \"non-intervention\" any longer takes our government and that of the US beyond any concept of moral responsibility and begins to make us part of the ongoing tragedy. Rev Anthony Peck General secretary, European Baptist Federation Tariq Ali (Comment, July 20) is worried that Israel's military action in Lebanon may lead to the downfall of the Syrian regime. I think he should rather be hopeful. Since he has spent his entire career berating the west for propping up third world dictatorships, this could be an opportunity to achieve a result at last. Unless Ali believes there are good dictatorships and bad ones? Malik Ibrahim Birmingham Jonathan Freedland seems to suggest (Comment, July 19) that the escalating cycle of violence in the Middle East is inevitable. There is, however, a solution which is possible but - in terms of Western realpolitik - unthinkable: that Israel be required to comply with at least some of the UN resolutions passed (and ignored) over the past few decades. Until the west stops treating Israel as a favoured exception to every rule, the sense of injustice and despair in the region will grow. Hilary Wise London Tony Blair is not alone in locating the origin (and blame) for the current hostilities with the kidnappings of Israeli soldiers. A day before Cpl Shalit was captured, Israeli commandos entered Gaza and abducted two Palestinians, a doctor and his brother, who Israel claims are members of Hamas. Yet in the eyes of the world, Hamas is the aggressor. Dr Ron Chrisley Brighton, East Sussex There is a world of difference between a cartoon, as the word is defined in the dictionary, and a cartoon that is just a masquerade for wild, one-sided invective. The former is \"a humorous drawing in a magazine, newspaper etc; especially as a topical comment\" (Oxford English Reference Dictionary). For an example of the latter, one should look no further than Martin Rowson's effort (July 19). The \"cartoon\" depicts a gloved fist beating a child soaked in his own blood. The glove is studded with blood-spattered Stars of David - a Jewish symbol that you will see on synagogues around the world. We have of course seen this kind of vicious caricature before: in Europe in the not-so-distant past, and more recently in the press of Arab and Muslim countries like Syria and Iran. I noted your clarification yesterday that the cartoon was not intended to impugn Jews, but merely the state of Israel. We have heard this mantra from too many different circles and the argument is wearing thin. A good cartoon should be clever and critical - indeed a good cartoon must often be more sophisticated than a good article. By contrast, there is nothing clever or sophisticated about this \"cartoon\"; at the very least, it could be described as incitement, if not worse than that. If your newspaper is in need of ideas for new material, I have one suggestion: how about a cartoon depicting a Hamas missile launched from Gaza, and a Hizbullah missile launched from Lebanon, meeting over Tel Aviv. Zvi Heifetz Ambassador of Israel Zena el-Khalil's distressing account of her experiences in Beirut under siege (G2, July 19) could be a dreadful coda to an exhibition recently held here. From May 13 to July 16 Modern Art, Oxford hosted an extraordinary show of contemporary artists from Beirut, called Out of Beirut. Must we now fear the sequel would have to be called End of Beirut?
