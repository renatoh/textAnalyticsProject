The Sun boycotted the event and held its own do down the road at Grosvenor House, leaving Mirror journalists with no one to pick on except Mail hacks. One prize conspicuously missing from the evening was the gong for dignity in the face of repeated provocation, which should have gone to the People's deputy news editor, James Scott. Despite numerous MediaGuardian.co.uk stories revealing that, in his days as a Daily Mirror showbusiness reporter, Scott was behind the 3am girls' Sven 'n' Ulrika exclusive, the judges in their wisdom decided to award the trio the prize for scoop of the year. As 3am's Eva Simpson went up on stage to collect the trophy - head girl Jessica Callan was too busy sunning herself somewhere - the People's table gave Scott a standing ovation. He took it all in his stride - not even rising to the bait when the Mirror editor, Piers Morgan, wittily wished him \"better luck next time\" - but murmurs from the Mirror's own tables showed exactly what hacks thought of the whole affair. We're Surrey Harris can't be with us tonight... The foreign reporter of the year prize went to Mark Franchetti of the Sunday Times, who couldn't be present but still managed to speak to host Clive Anderson from his cellphone in the Kuwaiti desert. This proved a difficult act to follow for the columnist of the year, Robert Harris, who was so busy writing his latest novel that the Telegraph editor, Charles Moore, had to accept the award on his behalf. Still on a high from his telephone conversation with Franchetti, Anderson commented archly on Harris: \"He's at home somewhere near Godalming and we couldn't get through to him.\" Spies like us Also missing from the prize list was an award for the wildest conspiracy theorist of the year. Waldemar Janusczak of the Sunday Times Culture section proved his credentials for the title in his acceptance speech after being named critic of the year. \"I've worked for two newspapers, the Sunday Times and the Guardian,\" Janusczak revealed. \"People ask me which is the most leftwing of the two. I would undoubtedly say the Sunday Times,\" he added. \"When I was at the Guardian I got the impression that most of the people were working for MI5, I'll tell you the facts later...\" No Monkey doesn't know what he was on about either... Bell strikes eloquent note Proving that Guardian journalists are capable of independent thought, the cartoonist of the year, Steve Bell, delivered what Anderson described as \"a typically eloquent speech from Steve Bell\". Holding his award aloft, Bell declared: \"Thank you to the Guardian for having me. Thank you to MI5 for employing us and I'd just like to say... fuck the war.\" Best defence One of the nominees for sports reporter of the year was Harry Harris, the former Mirror football writer lured to the Express two years ago with a \u00a3300,000 pay deal. In the absence of their friends from Wapping, Mirror hacks lost no opportunity in turning their fire on the faithless Harris, greeting the announcement his name with loud booing. In the event the title went to retired Guardian sports writer David Lacey, who was presented with his prize by George Best. \"Did you ever read what people said about your games?\" Anderson asked Best, who replied quick as a flash: \"I'm a footballer - we can't read.\" Maria doesn't miss a trick Maria Trkulja lost no time in thrusting herself back into the media arena after announcing to Hello! magazine staff last night that she is quitting as editor-in-chief, following \"editorial differences\" with the celebrity glossy's Spanish owner Eduardo Sanchez Junco. She flitted around sporting a glittering diamond necklace and losing no opportunity to network. \"Oh do introduce me to Piers Morgan, I've never actually met him,\" she exhorted one Mirror executive as the tabloid's editor strolled past."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
