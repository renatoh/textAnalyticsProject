If he reads research by Richard Wilkinson into the effects of inequality, he would reach a clear answer: \"yes\". Inequality kills. Wilkinson discovered that inequality has a negative impact on both our physical and mental health. The wider the income gap, the worse the impact. Although the poorest suffer most in an unequal society, everyone's health gets attacked by stress and anxiety. Wilkinson's research for his books Unhealthy Societies and The Impact of Inequality is breathtaking in its thoroughness and ability to refute alternative explanations of such things as health problems. We also now know from other research that levels of trust are higher in more equal societies. Social mobility is also improved in an egalitarian state. For instance, Denmark has better social mobility than the US. Equality is simply better for democracy. If a society is seen as being just or fair, people join in. The research backs this up: unequal societies eat away at the social fabric. Perhaps Barber needs to visit the Nordic countries for a few answers? Graeme Kemp Wellington, Shropshire The damage wrought in human terms by the obscene City bonuses, recently highlighted in the media, is real enough, but the left would make an enormous mistake by bringing back \"the politics of envy\", as advocated by Peter Wilby (Comment, December 29). To do so would simply reinforce the image of the left as being reactive and negative rather than creative and positive. Thus the antisocial increase in house prices that results from these inflated payments can be countered by a vast increase in public home-building. The criminality that results from the widening gap between rich and poor can be remedied by stimulating investment outside the home counties. And the best way to nullify the impact produced by the super-rich buying themselves into the best education and medical care is to set our schools and hospitals free from the stultifying bureaucracy that prevents them from giving the best possible service to the taxpayer. Walter Cairns Manchester Peter Wilby is right but he does not go far enough. The massive sums awarded to fat cats are not unconnected to real activity. Each \u00a31m bonus equates to the production of at least 10,000 laptops in China or 450 Nissan Micras in Sunderland - all of which produces the emissions that are killing the planet. These people are driving the demands that rack up unnecessary production, fuel unnecessary consumerism and leave the unhappy masses turning to junk food for consolation. When will politicians realise the link between growing inequality, environmental destruction and the obesity epidemic?
