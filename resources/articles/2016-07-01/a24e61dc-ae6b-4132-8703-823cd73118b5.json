The video, put together by Alicia Keys and her foundation We Are Here and published on Mic, is called 23 Ways You Could Be Killed If You Are Black in America. Each celebrity reads out one of the ways that an African American has been killed by police officers, telling the stories of people who have dominated headlines in recent years including Sandra Bland, Eric Garner and Tamir Rice. \u201cRiding in your girlfriend\u2019s car with a child in the back,\u201d says pop queen Beyonc\u00e9, about Philando Castile, whose death, captured on Facebook Live video by his girlfriend, sparked Black Lives Matter protests last week. \u201cSelling CDs outside of a supermarket,\u201d says actor Taraji P Henson, in reference to Alton Sterling, who was shot on camera in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last week. With its low production values, the video appears to have been recorded by the stars \u2013 including Bono, Chance the Rapper, Lenny Kravitz and Chris Rock \u2013 on their iPhones at home. Each celebrity appears in grainy black and white closeup before the photo and name of the person of whose death they are speaking appears \u2013 a technique that shows the similarity between the predominately black stars and the victims of police violence. \u201cWearing a hoodie,\u201d says musician and producer Pharrell Williams, a reference to Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old boy shot and killed in Florida in 2012 by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who thought Martin looked suspicious. \u201cNot servile enough,\u201d Rihanna says. \u201cWe demand radical transformation to heal the long history of systemic racism so that all Americans have the equal right to live and pursue happiness,\u201d Keys says at the end of the video, in a call to action. The deaths of Sterling and Castile also inspired other artists \u2013 including John Legend, Questlove and Missy Elliott \u2013 to speak out publicly last week. This video is the latest step for Beyonc\u00e9, who has become very active politically in recent months around Black Lives Matter and issues of police violence. During her world tour in Glasgow last week, she asked for a moment\u2019s silence while names of those killed by police appeared on a screen behind her. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 July 2016 to correct the spelling of Taraji P Henson\u2019s name, from Henderson as an earlier version said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
