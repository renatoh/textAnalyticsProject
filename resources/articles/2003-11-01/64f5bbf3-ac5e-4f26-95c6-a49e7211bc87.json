The board said it was acting because the number of young people being held in custody was falling sharply and because it wished to use privately run secure training centres, which were cheaper. Local authorities - which run most of the homes - warned that they would not be able to keep them all open after such a big cut in the number of places taken up by the YJB, which at present uses some 75% of capacity. There are 28 secure children's homes in England, catering for the 10-17 age group. They accommodate mainly sentenced or remanded young offenders, but also \"welfare\" cases where the young person may be exhibiting extreme or risk-taking behaviour. There are three secure training centres, run by Premier Prisons Services and Group 4, with a fourth due next year in Milton Keynes with 80 places. The centres cater only for sentenced or remanded youngsters. Sir Charles Pollard, acting chair of the YJB, will today tell its annual convention that he wants faster reform of the \"juvenile secure estate\" to match the pace of change in other areas of youth justice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
