This wasn\u2019t just any job at any newspaper. Melbourne may be Australia\u2019s second largest city, the place where the first Australian parliament sat in 1901, home to over three million people by the year 1991, and the nation\u2019s self-declared cultural, intellectual and sporting capital since time immemorial, but ever since the Argus ceased publication in January 1957 after 108 years, Melbourne has sustained just one daily morning broadsheet newspaper, the Age. That was where the reporter\u2019s job was. Outside the Age, the full-time employment options for a serious writer of non-fiction in Melbourne were limited: he could apply for a job at the Herald-Sun, the popular, commercially-successful, Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid; he could try his luck interstate by applying for a job at one of the other state capitals\u2019 broadsheet newspapers; or he could apply for a job at the Australian, the national broadsheet newspaper launched by Murdoch in 1964. And that was about it really. For a bespectacled, bookish young man who enjoyed reading history, the classics and Shakespeare in his spare time, the options were probably limited to the latter two. But he didn\u2019t choose any of those conventional options. Instead, he took a job as a staff writer at an upstart publication called Independent Monthly. The year was 1992. The writer\u2019s name was Gideon Haigh. He was 27-years-old. Many years later, he recalled that the \u201cobscure monthly magazine\u201d paid him so poorly that he was \u201cliving on breakfast cereal\u201d. By 1996, the magazine was dead. Apart from reading, Haigh had one other great love \u2014 cricket. He\u2019d grown up playing the game and reading the likes of Sir Neville Cardus and Ray Robinson. He played and read about cricket still. Heck, as a teenager, he\u2019d even spent two months in England watching county cricket \u2014 a choice of holiday some Australians might regard as indicative of insanity. While at Independent Monthly, he wrote a cricket piece for a magazine even more short-lived and obscure than his then employer. The magazine was called FYI and the piece was about a seismic event in cricket history which everyone knew of, but no-one truly understood \u2014 Kerry Packer\u2019s World Series Cricket revolution. World Series Cricket wasn\u2019t just a cricket story; it was one of the great untold stories in modern Australian history, a revolution which fundamentally changed the way that cricket was watched, played and sold in a nation whose national cricket team predates the nation itself by some 23 years. For any young, close-to-penniless writer subsisting on breakfast cereal in a one-bedroom flat, such a state of affairs induces one universal response: WRITE THE BOOK ABOUT IT! This was easier thought than done. For starters, Haigh would need to interview, at minimum, a substantial number of the key participants in the revolution \u2014 cricketers, cricket administrators, businessmen and Packer employees. The young writer encountered obstacles at every turn. Many of the cricketers were reluctant to speak to him because they didn\u2019t know him. At the Age, he\u2019d written about business. He\u2019d never been one of the Age\u2019s beat cricket reporters or correspondents. And the attitude of many cricketers to an interview request from a freelance writer they\u2019d never heard of was summed up by Tony Greig\u2019s initial pointed reply: \u201cHow do I know I can trust you?\u201d Many of the cricket administrators remained deeply wounded by a very public war (which they\u2019d comprehensively lost) and felt betrayed by the cricketers whose interests they honestly believed \u2014 rightly or wrongly \u2014 that they\u2019d done their best to serve, only to see them defect to a media mogul\u2019s upstart circus at the first available opportunity. And as for the media mogul and his employees? As Haigh himself recently explained: \u201cKerry Packer had by this stage suffered the public odium of the Goanna affair and, I heard later, sent down the line that I was not to receive any cooperation.\u201d As if gathering the raw data necessary to write the book wasn\u2019t difficult enough, Haigh also had to find a publisher. That has never been an easy task for a young writer in a geographically isolated country with a small population. The Australian book market and publishing industry just aren\u2019t very big. And they\u2019re even smaller where cricket books are concerned. Not even the late, great Ray Robinson, Australia\u2019s finest cricket writer since the war, could find steady employment at an Australian publication as a cricket writer in a career spanning half a century, instead writing successfully about Australian cricket for overseas publications. Growing up in Melbourne in the 90s, I discovered a few things about cricket books before I\u2019d finished primary school. Cricket books were expensive. And literary cricket books were hard to find. The very first cricket book that I persuaded my parents to buy for me was Dean Jones\u2019s Dean Jones: One-Day Magic (1991). It was just about the only cricket book I could find in the bookshop. It\u2019s a good book, but literature it is not. The price sticker, still distinct after all these years, informs me that it cost $16.95 (discounted from $18.95) from a Melbourne bookshop in 1991. That\u2019s bloody expensive \u2014 in 1991, the average price of a movie ticket in Australia was $6.95; in 2012 money, $16.95 is worth $28.89. So, to return to Haigh in Melbourne in 1992, he had to somehow find a publisher for a serious cricket book in a country where editors and publishers were largely indifferent to literary cricket writing (and, indeed, any cricket writing not done by a former Test cricketer), where the book market in general was small and books were hideously over-priced, and the economy was just coming out of a painful recession. He was rejected by 11 publishers before Text Publishing agreed to publish his book. Haigh holed up in his one-bedroom flat and wrote his book. He couldn\u2019t afford his own computer, so he wrote on a Mac Classic borrowed from his office on weekends. Soon, he ran into the same twin threats that every 20-something writer composing their first major work has faced: \u201ccabin fever and starvation\u201d. His mum saved the day, bringing him \u201clight, sustenance and hygiene.\u201d The book was published in 1993. It was titled The Cricket War: The Inside Story of Kerry Packer\u2019s World Series Cricket. The Cricket War was his first book about cricket. It would not be his last. Last year, his 24th book about cricket, On Warne, won the 2013 Cricket Society and Marylebone Cricket Club Book of the Year award. Twenty-one years after the publication of his debut cricket book, Haigh towers over the cricket writing landscape in Australia. As someone who grew up in Melbourne reading him, it has been fascinating to watch his development as a cricket writer. The clearest way to highlight this change over the course of an innings which has lasted 20 years and counting is to compare The Cricket War with On Warne. It is a study in contrasts. The Cricket War is first and foremost, a stunning piece of original research, the end product of a \u201cmassive data-quest that gradually entombed the writer in his flat\u201d. The book\u2019s subtitle promises \u201cThe Inside Story of Kerry Packer\u2019s World Series Cricket\u201d (emphasis added) and Haigh is as good as his word \u2013 the bibliography lists interviews with 48 people (including key players Ian Chappell, Greg Chappell, Tony Greig and Bob Parish), 126 \u201cbooks and theses\u201d (ranging from the well-known to the downright obscure, for example, a 1990 PhD thesis from the Graduate School of Ohio State University), and 20 magazines and newspapers. The findings of that diligent research are rendered in sparse, matter-of-fact prose and exhaustive detail. The body text of my 1993 paperback edition is 326 pages long. The font size is uncomfortably small and the line spacing is cramped. Haigh stays within the orthodox confines of unadorned positive statements of fact and a dry writing style which borders at times on the academic. The rhetorical flourishes, rich historical and literary allusions, trenchant opinion and thunderous socio-political commentary and critique for which Haigh would later become famous are largely absent. Growing up, I\u2019d always assumed that the spartan prose of The Cricket War was entirely the upshot of a voluntary choice made by a young writer on his cricket writing debut. But, after corresponding with Haigh, who has been as generous with his time with me as Ian Chappell was with him all those years ago, I discovered that that there was actually \u201ca more prosaic reason\u201d for Haigh\u2019s adoption of that writing style \u2014 word limits. As Haigh explained: The ms came in at about 250,000 words. I had to cut it to 110,000. Not only were whole chapters excised, but I liposuctioned every sentence to the marrow, until I had eliminated almost all the articles, definite and indefinite. I got to 114,000 and my publisher took pity on me. I\u2019ve never gone back and read it, but I suspect I\u2019d be disappointed. By the time I was done, I feared it was almost staccato in places. The contrast with On Warne could not be greater. On Warne, as the mid-19th-century-treatise-like title suggests, is essentially a discursive literary-philosophical essay on Shane Warne. A publisher \u201casked\u201d Haigh to write it, not vice versa. It is chock full of Haigh\u2019s trenchant opinions about everything from the respective merits of Warne and Stuart MacGill as Test bowlers to the nature and role of the modern news media. Those opinions are eloquently expressed in the effortlessly allusive, erudite prose which led the Observer to declare in 2005: \u201cIf Flintoff is the cricketer that England waited two decades for, Gideon Haigh may be the writer for a game that inspires literature.\u201d Haigh is as fluent in popular culture as he is high culture, adroitly comparing Warne with characters as diverse as Jez in Peep Show, Reggie Dunlop in Slap Shot, and Edward Ashburnham in Ford Madox Ford\u2019s The Good Soldier (1928). The Cricket War was a difficult book to write. It took Haigh more than a year. He had to \u201charry\u201d his interview subjects \u201cat length\u201d, \u201cmolest most often more than once\u201d, and \u201cbeg, borrow and badger many favours and much patience from total strangers.\u201d He told me recently: \u201cfrankly, I was so fucked up by the finish, weighing about seven stone, that I could do no more. I can\u2019t remember who observed that books aren\u2019t so much completed as abandoned, but my own experience tends to confirm it.\u201d On Warne was composed, without any undue effort, in the space of one month. \u201cIt was actually surprisingly easy\u201d, Haigh told Couch Talk. If it makes you feel any better he did go on to explain that \u201cit was a 31 day month so you can get quite a lot done.\u201d He probably didn\u2019t even have to leave the comfort of his home to write the book \u2013 the brief bibliography reveals that he didn\u2019t conduct a single new interview and, it seems reasonable to presume that most, if not all, of the 69 books and three articles listed therein could be found in his personal library which weighs \u201cfive tons\u201d and occupies the four walls of his study. On Warne is the essence of Haigh: the work of a mature artist at the very peak of his powers. Just about the only quibble I\u2019ve read in the glowing reviews is that, in the words of Andy Bull: \u201cThere is just not enough of it.\u201d But even here, Haigh has succeeded, not erred. As an admirer of the great essayists Michel de Montaigne and Bertrand Russell, Haigh would be acutely aware that if On Warne \u2014 remember, a work of non-fiction containing not a single new interview \u2014 had been substantially longer, critics would have called it self-indulgent, pretentious even, not praised it for its thoroughness. Haigh likes Warne. A lot. He\u2019s liked him from the moment they met nearly two decades ago. He is admirably candid about this in the opening chapter of On Warne: \u201cit\u2019s best in journalism not to like your subjects too much, lest you forget the roles of the respective parties. \u2026 I\u2019m bound to say that it was harder to set this aside with Warne than almost anyone I have interviewed.\u201d Haigh is a moral man. He does the right thing, even when doing so substantially harms his own interests, for no other reason than that it\u2019s the right thing to do. The man lives the categorical imperative. In 2009, he quit his well-paid role as the Monthly\u2019s de facto staff writer because of its \u201cscurvy treatment\u201d of then editor (and Haigh\u2019s former partner), Dr Sally Warhaft, culminating in her \u201cforced \u2026 resignation\u201d and the unwarranted \u201ctrash[ing]\u201d of her \u201creputation\u201d. In one act of moral reason, Haigh \u2014 an out-and-out freelancer since 1995 \u2014 \u201chalved\u201d his income at a time when he\u2019d just gotten married, his wife had given birth to their first child, and the world\u2019s print media was staring at an economic abyss. That\u2019s moral courage. If you look closely, it\u2019s evident in the opening pages of On Warne too, when Haigh\u2019s 28-year-old self politely rejects Warne\u2019s offer of a lift after their first meeting on the basis that \u201caccepting a favour that obligated me to my interviewee \u2026 might compromise my objectivity\u201d. But, this most moral of men, a self-described \u201cprude\u201d, likes Warne so much that he devotes approximately 11 of On Warne\u2019s 205 pages to attempting to understand Warne\u2019s marital infidelities. Haigh\u2019s starting position is to correctly draw a moral distinction between \u201cWarne\u2019s accountability to his wife and to the public\u201d, which are \u201cnot remotely the same thing\u201d, and rhetorically ask: \u201cWhy is it [ie Warne\u2019s sex life] our business? Who went to Warne for guidance in how to live one\u2019s life anyway?\u201d Haigh could have stopped there. Instead, in a book whose primary thesis is that Warne is \u201cthe best at something [that is, spin bowling] that there has ever been\u201d, Haigh proceeds to spend over seven times more pages discussing Warne\u2019s sexual peccadilloes than he does explaining, much less justifying, Warne\u2019s statistically abysmal Test record against the world\u2019s best players of spin in their own backyard \u2014 in nine Test matches, spread across three tours spanning more than six years, Warne took just 34 wickets in India at an average of 43.11, economy rate of 3.19 and strike rate of 81. I can still recall the aching sense of disappointment when I discovered, after reading On Warne in one sitting whilst waiting for a taxi to the airport, that Haigh spent all of one page considering the vexed question of Warne\u2019s Test record in India, which basically summarised the well-established, but not entirely convincing, explanations that we already knew \u2014 he was carrying a shoulder injury in 1998 and returning from knee and finger injuries in 2001. Of 2004, Warne\u2019s third and final Test tour, Haigh does not proffer a substantive answer at all. Haigh replied to my criticism as follows: As for his [ie Warne\u2019s] record in India, it didn\u2019t really fit in to the structure of the five self-contained essays. Remember that this is not a biography. There are lots of omissions. It\u2019s arguable I should have made some comment on the subject, and I do in passing \u2014 I point out that the occasions on which he toured India he was semi-fit; I note that he bowled in the IPL as I think he should have earlier, bowling straighter, allowing the strokeplayers less width and leverage. But you may be right. I wrote it, as you report, in a month. This was a book where the writing either came naturally or it didn\u2019t come at all. Warne didn\u2019t bowl the googly for the same reason. Haigh is the world\u2019s greatest living cricket writer. But he is not perfect. The flaw evident in On Warne is this: Haigh simply likes Warne too much, which is why he spends more time explaining Warne the man\u2019s private sex life than he does solving the puzzle of Warne the spin bowler\u2019s crummy Test record in India. In a sense, it\u2019s reassuring: Haigh has a heart. He\u2019s not just a giant brain in a hermetically-sealed glass jar plugged into a laptop in the State Library of Victoria. In 1996, just three years after the publication of The Cricket War, Haigh achieved what must have been one of his dreams \u2014 revising and updating Ray Robinson\u2019s classic, On Top Down Under: Australia\u2019s Cricket Captains, first published in 1975, so that it would remain as relevant to future generations as it was to his. In his preface to that revised and updated edition, Haigh rightly lamented: Robinson is a figure virtually unique in Australia. Despite cricket\u2019s fecundity with books, few Australian writers have aspired to crafting cricket literature of the kind associated with Sir Neville Cardus, RC Roberston-Glasgow, Alan Ross, Ronald Mason, EW Swanton, JM Kilburn and AA Thomson. Eighteen years on, it can safely be said that Haigh has changed that. The \u201csuccessful combination [of] elegance of prose and density of factual detail\u201d, which he praised in Robinson\u2019s writing, became a universally-acclaimed hallmark of his own. So much so that rereading some passages from Haigh\u2019s 1996 preface on Robinson now, it feels as if one is reading a glowing contemporary review of one of Haigh\u2019s own works. The apprentice has become the master. Haigh took the risks that others wouldn\u2019t. He did the work that others couldn\u2019t. And in so doing, he became the world\u2019s pre-eminent cricket writer. He has given us books that combine research ethic, writing ability and intellectual heft, books that have enriched our understanding not just of cricket history, but Australian history. Twenty-two years ago, a young newspaper reporter in Melbourne quit his job \u2014 and changed the face of Australian cricket writing forever. I am grateful. \u2022 The full version of this article will be published on SB Tang\u2019s blog later this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
