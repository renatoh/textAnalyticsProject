Even the respective directors of rugby struggled to get excited about an encounter that, had it involved the round ball at the home of the Football Association, would have merited no more than a few seconds at the end of Match of the Day. Both sides retained their unbeaten records but the England fly-half Owen Farrell missed four out of five penalties in the 50 minutes he was on the field, hampered by a groin strain, and while his replacement, Charlie Hodgson, drew Saracens level with two penalties within eight minutes of coming on, he missed a late drop goal from almost in front of the posts. It was the first tryless encounter of the Premiership campaign, a trying time for what will be one of the largest crowds in the regular season. \"It was a disappointing game for the spectators,\" said the Leicester director of rugby, Richard Cockerill. \"It was pretty poor.\" Matches between Saracens and Leicester have been rich in action controversy in recent seasons, but defence dominated attack on an afternoon when neither tryline was seriously threatened. Play was stop rather than start and the afternoon was littered by unforced errors and penalties: Saracens infringed up front and the Tigers were blown at the breakdown but the referee, Martin Fox, failed to show anyone a yellow card, even though the game both demanded and needed the sanction to be applied. The Tigers face the champions and current leaders Harlequins at Welford Road on Saturday evening, a replay of last May's play-off final, and their wing Scott Hamilton expects to see more of the ball than he did against the side which defeated Leicester in the 2011 final. \"As a back you enjoy playing Harlequins more than Saracens because they play an attractive brand of rugby,\" said the All Black. \"Saracens are the most aggressive team in defence you will meet and the game never got going: the scrum was a debacle and the breakdown was tough for the referee. Harlequins will have a different approach. Some were predicting they would suffer a hangover after winning the Premiership last season but they have made a great start and, if anything, success has made then even better.\" One of the few players to rise above the mediocrity was the Saracens and England full-back Alex Goode whose counter-attacks tended to be wrecked by poor handling on a warm afternoon. \"Both teams were pretty frustrated,\" he said. \"We were disappointed because when we got on the front foot a few last passes or skill errors cost us. A plus was that the respect they had for our defence meant they kicked a lot in the second half.\" Tuesday's European Rugby Cup Ltd's meeting in Dublin promises far more in terms of action. Saturday's supposed match of the day in the Premiership may have been low on highlights, but such is the tournament's commercial pull that the English clubs could live without Europe. In contrast, professional sides in the other three home unions and Italy would be on life support without the Heineken Cup. The Saracens' chairman, Nigel Wray, used his programme notes to float an alternative should the Celtic unions and Italy resist England and France's calls for reform. He pointed out that in the southern hemisphere South Africa were like the clubs in England and France, effectively subsidising their partners, New Zealand and Australia, in the television deals for the Super 15 and the Rugby Championship. \"Oddly enough, South Africa are in exactly the same time zone as England, France, Ireland, Scotland etc,\" he noted. \"Now there's food for thought. Maybe not in my lifetime, but the landscape of rugby will change enormously. And for the better.\" Saracens Goode; Ashton, Tomkins, Barritt, Short (Wyles, 60); Farrell (Hodgson, 50), De Kock (Wigglesworth, 50); Vunipola (Gill, 60), Brits (Smit, 60), Nieto (Du Plessis, 48), Borthwick (capt), Botha (Hargreaves, 65), Brown, Wray (Fraser, 70), Joubert.
