Spackman has combined television punditry with scouting for England since leaving Sheffield United in 1998. \"I felt that the time was right to get a full-time job, a proper job, and that's why I'm here,\" he said. Barnsley have slumped since reaching last season's play-off final and Spackman said: \"If we can finish in the top half of the league it will be a good end to the season and then hopefully over the years we can get the club back in the Premiership.\" West Ham, who have been seeking defensive cover since selling Rio Ferdinand to Leeds in November, yesterday confirmed they were close to bringing Blackburn's Christian Dailly to Upton Park. Dailly would cost around \u00a32.25m, with Marc Keller going in the opposite direction. \"Talks will be held with the rel evant parties in the week and we hope a deal can be concluded,\" said West Ham's managing director Paul Aldridge. The club will also meet Rangers' Lorenzo Amoruso, another defender. In such a hectic schedule Harry Redknapp, their manager, must also find time for Steve Lomas, who is confused after West Ham accepted \u00a33.7m bids for him from Everton and Manchester City. \"I hope to see him in the next day or two,\" said Lomas. \"Hopefully things will then be sorted out one way or the other.\" West Ham's FA Cup game at Manchester United has been moved to Sunday January 28 to allow for TV coverage. It will be shown on ITV at 2pm. Sky will show two fixtures over the weekend, with Leeds's home tie with Liverpool to be played at 12pm on January 27 and Chelsea's visit to Gillingham at 4pm the following day. Sky will also show the third-round replay between Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and Charlton on Wednesday January 17 at 7.45pm. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
