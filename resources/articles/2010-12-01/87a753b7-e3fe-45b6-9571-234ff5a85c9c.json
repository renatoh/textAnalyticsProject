It might have come as a surprise to some that Tron had much of a legacy; the film was overshadowed by Spielberg's ET in that year, and in the UK suffered the mortification of being upstaged by Peter Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract. Yet a generation grew up prizing Tron for being audacious, ahead of its time, a futurist trailblazer about games culture and the digital world. Its most famous legatee is Christopher Nolan, creator of Inception, and maybe that's the movie that original Tron fans would still prefer to watch. This hog-whimperingly expensive and worryingly dull reboot stars Jeff Bridges as entrepreneur and genius Kevin Flynn. Twenty years ago, Kevin created a brilliant new digital system. (This happened in 1989, not 1982, incidentally, in order to make his infant son young enough to be a twentysomething hunk in the present day.) At the height of his sensational celebrity, Flynn vanished, and now in 2010 his boy Sam (Garrett Hedlund) tumbles into the virtual domain that his dad created, and where he is now in exile: this hidden universe is dominated by an unimaginably colossal gaming arena and is ruled by Kevin's evil alter ego Clu, his own digitally created younger self from 1989. Where once Kevin had hoped to draw upon the positive energies of this secret world \u2013 creating \"bio-digital jazz\" \u2013 the sinister Clu wants only to rule over a digital police state and preside over the cruel neo-imperial spectacle of games. There's interesting stuff in this new Tron, particularly some subversive jabs at the regressive solipsism of computer games. But there's plenty that's very dull and laborious, too. The digital technology used to create the \"young\" Jeff Bridges is weird and not in a good way: this waxy, unlined figure resembles one of the Westworld robots, but looks less real. In the original 1982 Tron, the superimposition of glowing real human faces on computer-graphic figures might have seemed odd, yet it now arguably looks interestingly Soviet-heroic, or like something by Fritz Lang. Obviously, this has all gone. There is now no question of seeing the join. The digital effects are the finest money can buy. And yet the effect is strangely retro \u2013 the black-and-chrome stylings look like something from the late 1970s or early 80s. Nightclubs of the era looked a lot like this. And the sudden appearance of vivid-white boudoir spaces is taken straight from 2001: very Sanderson, very Stanley Kubrick. Successful or not, Tron was pushing the envelope, trying for something new, Tron: Legacy is paralysed by its reverence for the old."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
