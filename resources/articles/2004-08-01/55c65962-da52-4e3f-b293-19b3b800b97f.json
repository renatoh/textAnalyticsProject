It's summer! It's another disappointingly thin games release schedule! Yes, while the US gets Doom 3 we make do with Catwoman and Chaos League. Luckily Doom is out next week so, until then, here's a rundown of this week's games: Catwoman (PS2, Xbox, GC) Bloody awful film tie-in which I reviewed here. Next.... Ironstorm: World War Zero (PS2) An imaginative premise \u2013 WW1 has lasted 50 years \u2013 is wasted on an average first person shooter (FPS). I reviewed it here. America's 10 Most Wanted (PC) Controversial? Puerile? A bit of both here, with this FPS that sets you the task of hunting down the likes of Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. Haven't played this yet but, lets face it, it is more than likely to be utter utter tosh. Chaos League (PC) You have to applaud the guys behind this. After all, mixing the real-time-strategy (RTS) and role-playing (RPG) genres into a future sports game is an idea undoubtedly conceived after a heavy lunchtime session at the local. I haven't played it yet, so whether this lunacy works or not remains to be seen. Samurai Jack: The Shadow of Aku (PS2, GC) One for the kiddies this, although adults may enjoy its Zelda: Wind Waker style adventuring. Based on the cartoon series, this is suitable for all the family and is my game of the week. Also, if there are any parents reading this then buy this for your kids and not an 18 rated game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
