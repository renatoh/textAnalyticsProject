Hardt is founder, chairman and bartender at Sxip, which provides Sxipper for Firefox. And he's a Mac fan. But he's also had \"a few unsophisticated investors that have been \u2026 making my life miserable for the last 10 months,\" and presumably got an offer he couldn't refuse. I presume he's already been working with Microsoft's identity 2.0 expert, Kim Cameron. As I noted earlier, after Google's Ben Laurie shot holes in OpenID, there was: a joint announcement from Dick Hardt of Sxip Identity, Michael Graves from VeriSign, JanRain's Scott Kveton and Kim Cameron. This said that OpenID (JanRain and Sxip) will support InfoCards, Microsoft will support Open- ID, and Kim Cameron \"will work with the OpenID community on authentication and anti-phishing.\" Still, I wouldn't have bothered with this, except for the chance to recommend you watch Dick Hardt's famous presentation on Identity 2.0 at OSCON2005. You won't regret it. See Network World for more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
