Hunte came to my club, Shepherd\u2019s Bush, when we played Stanmore, who got Reid. I happened to be playing, and recall that while Reid was the more serious of the two, they were both very gracious about having to ply their trade at a lower than usual standard. Both scored 30-odd runs before getting out, and fortunately Reid turned down the opportunity to bowl. As a Test-level medium-fast bowler on a damp club wicket in September I dread to think how many wickets he might have taken."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
