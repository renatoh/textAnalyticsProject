I've just started working as a presenter/reporter for Newsround on the CBBC digital channel and it's been a mad, but very exciting, few weeks. I'm currently working the early shift, which means I have to be in at 6am and preparing our first Newsround at 7.30. On my first day I was told to prepare a piece, and I just felt sick but I managed to get through it, and it's going really well. As a team we're given a lot of editorial control - we get a newsfeed from the BBC's main newsdesk and produce items ourselves. It's up to us to decide on the best stories for our viewers. Although I always wanted to be a journalist, I chose to study law and theology for my first degree. I'd always felt media degrees were rather too general in their approach and chose to go down the postgrad route for that reason. The course at City University was very practical right from the start. One part of the week was spent learning the theory of being a journalist - media law, ethics, what makes a good story, etc - while the second half was spent producing news items. We alternated between radio and television and produced items as if they were real. At City, the tutors place great emphasis on getting work experience between terms. I spent three weeks of that working for BBC Radio in Belfast. I also did stints with the Channel 4 programme Despatches and Breakfast with Frost. When the course ended I did two weeks unpaid work for Radio 1's Newsbeat and sent off thousands of letters to every news organisation I could find. That led on to small bits of paid work and the offer of a contract at BBC Essex. Ultimately, I would love to report on politics in my native Northern Ireland. I had a taste during my placement in Belfast -it was fascinating. milesbrignall@blueyonder.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
