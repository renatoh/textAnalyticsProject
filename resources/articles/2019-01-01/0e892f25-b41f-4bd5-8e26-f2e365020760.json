But, as he contemplates what may be his last appearance on a tennis court \u2013 against Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open on Monday \u2013 the manner of his leaving still consumes him. He has two stark choices: replace the hip that has turned him into a walking target and dream about another improbable comeback in the distant future, or have what is known as re-surfacing, a midway solution that would rescue at least some of his athleticism, if not enough for him to play professional tennis. For months Murray fought against the notion that soon the modest inscription on his Twitter biography \u2013 \u201cI play tennis\u201d \u2013 would be as redundant as his rackets. \u201cMy hip needs to be replaced at some stage,\u201d he admitted on Friday in Melbourne. \u201cIt\u2019s badly damaged. But I\u2019ve dealt with the feeling for a very long time. I\u2019d say: \u2018If I can reduce the pain, it\u2019s something I\u2019ll be able to compete with.\u2019 \u201cBut it got to a point where it wouldn\u2019t improve. I can\u2019t damage my hip more by playing. Obviously it will get worse [with age] but there are operations that will fix that. If I stop playing tennis today, I would seriously consider having an operation because, day to day, life is not fun if I can\u2019t do stuff I would want to do \u2013 even if I wasn\u2019t a professional athlete. \u201cI would want to go and play football with my friends or go and play 18 holes of golf \u2013 whereas now I can\u2019t think of anything worse than going and playing five-a-side football because I can\u2019t kick a football. \u201cThere is a possibility it [a hip replacement] could prolong my career. Hip resurfacing is something that has been around for 15 years and has been successful for a younger generation of people that have had issues with hips. It allows them to live a very active lifestyle and that is why, I understand from speaking to experts, it is a better option for somebody of my age. \u201cIf I was to stop playing today, that is something I would consider because it would allow me to run around a little bit more freely than with a hip replacement. I\u2019m sure there are some doctors and surgeons who would dispute that and say a hip replacement is better. But there are quite a few athletes out there who have gone back to competing after having [resurfacing] done. As somebody who wants to live an active lifestyle, it\u2019s a better option for me.\u201d He pretty much made his mind up that his career was over after a wretched third practice session with Fernando Verdasco in Miami in early December. The pain shooting through his right hip went straight to his heart and he told his team: \u201cThis is it. I need to know when this is over. My hip is killing me.\u201d Murray recalled: \u201cI had tears in my eyes. I said to them: \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be continuing to go through that for nothing any more.\u2019\u201d Murray needed a result or an end-point, as he calls it, a scoreline. \u201cThere have been points through the last year [since hip surgery in Melbourne] where I had spoken about stopping. I was in too much pain, wasn\u2019t enjoying it. It didn\u2019t feel like the surgery had worked. I had been advised after having the operation that things could improve after up to a year to 18 months. I was advised to see how that goes. Then I went off to Philadelphia and did different rehab, which helped and improved things to a point. \u201cBut my hip doesn\u2019t recover from matches or training any more. In Brisbane [last week, when he lost in straight sets in the second round to the world No 16 Daniil Medvedev], I felt OK in the first match \u2013 not amazing, just OK. But next day I felt quite a bit worse. As a tournament goes on, the pain gets worse, so my performance drops. There\u2019s no possibility for me to do well.\u201d He has consulted his wife, Kim, and spoken to his mother, Judy, and brother, Jamie, who were on their way to Melbourne, he said, where they would more fully take on board what he is going through. \u201cI\u2019d imagine they are pretty gutted for me. They know everything I have gone through \u2013 well, to a certain extent they do. I have spoken to them a lot, probably my mum more than my brother. They know this isn\u2019t a decision I want to take but one I feel I have to. You guys all have loved ones as well, you know what it is like. \u201cLook, at the end of the day, it is only tennis. It\u2019s just a game, whatever. There is more to life than that. But for many reasons it\u2019s been more than that for me. Stopping the way it\u2019s happened doesn\u2019t sit particularly well with me. It\u2019s not how I would want to finish playing. I don\u2019t think any athlete wants that. They want to go out when they decide, not have their body telling them that is the case. That\u2019s the hardest part of it.\u201d Murray doubts he can ever replace the excitement that engaged him on court. \u201cYou can\u2019t. Well, maybe you can by taking certain substances, but you cannot recreate the high of winning Wimbledon or winning a Davis Cup. As much as the lows of losing here for a fifth time hurt, I always had that as a motivation. It was something that gave me drive, to get up and work hard. I don\u2019t anticipate being able to replace that. That\u2019s something that maybe when I finish I will be happy about, living a more stable life.\u201d And what have been the biggest highs? \u201cTwo things stand out to me: the second Wimbledon and carrying the flag at the Olympics. That was an off-court thing. There are not loads of things off the court that relate to my tennis. They don\u2019t for me come anywhere close to that.\u201d The man who did more than any of his coaches to transform Murray into the fully fledged champion he became was Ivan Lendl. Lendl said on Friday: \u201cAs Andy looks to wind down over the coming months the world of tennis will lose a great competitor but he will leave a measure of true grit that we all can learn from. Andy always left it all out on the court and I will look back with great feelings about the years we worked together. They were a lot of fun times filled with excitement. I am honoured to have been part of his team and to have been able to help him achieve as many of his lofty goals as possible.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
