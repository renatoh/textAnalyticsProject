We\u2019re here to compete\u2019", "bodyText": "Three years ago Fiona Brown came round after an anaesthetic to be told her knees had let her down and she would never play professional football. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m stubborn,\u201d says the Scotland and Roseng\u00e5rd winger as the heat of the Mediterranean sun erases the minor aches and niggles she can still feel in her repaired cruciate ligaments. \u201cI\u2019ve had two ACL operations, in 2012 and 2015. The second one was gutting. I remember being told: \u2018You\u2019ll never play pro now, you can\u2019t train that much any more\u2019 and then being a bit angry about that. I had my heart set on playing pro and that\u2019s what I was going to do. My stubbornness meant I did everything to make it happen. Of course there\u2019s doubts but, luckily, my body allowed it. \u201cAfter the operations it\u2019s horrible when you can\u2019t do things like shower yourself and there were days when I thought: \u2018You\u2019re not going to do this\u2019 \u2026. But people saying I wouldn\u2019t turn pro has probably been an extra motivation, helping me get where I am now.\u201d That precise location is Nice, the venue for Sunday\u2019s World Cup Group D opener against England and Brown\u2019s mere presence offers hope to the countless female footballers who have suffered ACL ruptures. It is an injury men fear but which occurs far more frequently among women and Brown has studied the reasons why. \u201cOne cause is the shape of your hips \u2013 we have a wider pelvis, so naturally there\u2019s more strain going on to the knees,\u201d she says. \u201cThen hormonal factors also come into consideration.\u201d There is a medical consensus that female footballers are more vulnerable in the first half of their menstrual cycle before ovulation but it has turned into a somewhat controversial issue. \u201cThere\u2019s hundreds and hundreds of studies on it,\u201d Brown says. \u201cBut other people are fighting that, saying it\u2019s nothing to do with it and it\u2019s all down to luck but there\u2019s a lot of significance in the studies.\u201d Which is not to say women cannot guard against such misfortunes. \u201cYou need to build up strength all around your knees,\u201d the 24-year-old says. \u201cI still do stuff like that every single day. As someone who has been through injuries I can\u2019t stress the importance of that enough. If I\u2019d known what I know now maybe my first injury wouldn\u2019t have happened, but I had no muscle around the joint then.\u201d Another theory is that women\u2019s knees become extra vulnerable when, as often happens, they play in men\u2019s footwear. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d says Brown. \u201cMy boots were always comfortable.\u201d Despite living in Sweden, where she was finally able to turn professional, the winger\u2019s heart remains in her native Dunblane. Accordingly Brown was delighted when one of the town\u2019s most celebrated residents, tennis\u2019s Judy Murray, joined Nicola Sturgeon and Steve Clarke in offering Shelley Kerr\u2019s squad motivational talks. \u201cMy parents know Judy,\u201d she says. \u201cShe\u2019s lovely, she does so much charity work in Dunblane and so much for women\u2019s sport in Scotland, and all the UK actually. Judy told us it\u2019s easy to get sidetracked in big competitions where there\u2019s a lot of pressure on but to take in the moment, really enjoy it and do everything you can to give yourself the best chance of performing at the highest level you can. \u201cI grew up watching Andy and Jamie Murray play tennis and they\u2019re huge inspirations as well as a source of massive local pride. Andy\u2019s a huge role model; he shows how you can have near misses and end up succeeding \u2013 and he\u2019s also a massive champion of women\u2019s sport.\u201d Sturgeon\u2019s support of a previously only partially professional squad dictates Scotland are much evolved from two years ago when they were thrashed 6-0 by England at Euro 2017. Courtesy of the first minister\u2019s intervention, Kerr\u2019s players have been funded as full-timers for the past six months, with part-timers taking sabbaticals from day jobs. \u201cThe team\u2019s completely transformed,\u201d Brown says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a different coach [Kerr, formerly of Arsenal], different players \u2013 some with Champions League experience \u2013 and a different style. \u201cShelley\u2019s been around the game a long time and she\u2019s created a very relaxed atmosphere. She makes everything feel natural. This time we know we\u2019re here to compete; we\u2019re not here to make up the numbers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
