Whether it's turning out that way, we'll know better at lunchtime today, when former cabinet secretary Robin Butler delivers his ruling on the way intelligence was used in the lead-up to the war against Iraq. We'll have an even clearer idea in the small hours of Friday morning, thanks to the results of two by-elections in what should be safe Labour territory, in Leicester and Birmingham. If Butler and the Midlands electorate give the prime minister a kicking, he might respond by doing some kicking of his own - by booting out a minister or two and engaging in that great summer sport: the reshuffle. If he does bring in some fresh faces, that will please more than the lucky promotees. One high-ranking official tells me there is a whole generation of Labour talent that feels frustrated in its current confinement to the second-tier of government. Able junior ministers, they're eager to get their hands on the big levers - and they're itching for the old guard to shift out of the way. They find themselves especially irritated with the two men at the top. \"You know what it's like,\" says my source. \"Two middle-aged blokes, both been in their jobs for a long time - they've got used to doing things a certain way.\" The operation has become stale, complains the new guard: what's needed is renewal. They're right that there's a problem - but it will take a lot more than a reshuffle to solve it. The government is bedevilled by two ailments, both of which are in need of urgent attention. The first is the tension between those two middle-aged blokes. One hesitates to delve yet again into the never-ending saga that is the Blair-Brown relationship. For a decade journalists and politicians have obsessed over this topic, unbothered whether they were leaving voters and readers cold. But it can no longer be dismissed as the froth of Westminster gossip. Now, regrettably, it is having a direct effect on the fate of this government. For two weekends in succession, it has dominated the political news. Ten days ago it was a spat over the forthcoming memoirs of a little-known Downing Street aide said to be replete with attacks on Gordon Brown. The Treasury hit back with a rare public condemnation. A few days ago it was the BBC's report that a parade of ministers had visited the prime minister urging him to stay in the job. I'm told that the two weekends' revelations left both men \"beside themselves\" with fury. That's not so unusual until you consider the timing. The \"stay Tony\" story appeared on the eve of one of the biggest days in the government calendar, the chancellor's announcement of his comprehensive spending review. Labour should have been basking in 48 hours of favourable coverage. Instead it trod on its own story. Bottom line: the leadership question is visibly interfering with Labour's ability to govern. One party veteran sighs that things can't go on like this: they have to be sorted out, one way or the other. Yet that is nothing next to the second great iron ball chained to Labour's ankle. This one is marked Iraq, and today will bring more proof of its power to hobble. The Butler report will reopen the issue which has dominated this second term, barely 48 hours after Brown's Commons performance had finally managed to win attention for Labour's domestic programme. That's how it's been for nearly two years. The government knows it has to talk about schools and hospitals - but every time it tries, the agenda swings back to Baghdad. Tomorrow's by-elections could prove the point most starkly. Muslim votes will be a factor in both constituencies; if they punish Labour over Iraq by switching their allegiance to the Liberal Democrats, that will prove what last month's local elections also suggested - that the war is exacting an electoral cost. That Iraq has become a boil aching for the lance is now widely accepted. The question is, how? One option would be for Tony Blair to perform the procedure on himself. That would entail a speech expressing the frankest possible contrition: \"I told you Saddam Hussein was a threat and I sincerely believed it - but I was mistaken. I now realise that I saw what I wanted to see. I never sought to deceive, but my senior staff and I failed to heed the warnings and doubts that were put to us. I made the intelligence sound harder than it was and for that I apologise. It is a mistake I vow never to make again.\" Only that degree of honesty would do the job. Yet how many of us can imagine the prime minister making such a speech? Even if he did, it could destroy rather than save him: the opposition would insist that a man whose judgement is, by his own admission, so flawed was no longer qualified to lead the country. That leaves just one course of action: a change of leader. Luckily for Labour, the war is tied so closely to Blair that his departure would, by itself, signal a close to the Iraq chapter. But to be effective the move needs to come before the next general election. If the prime minister were to cling on, the next campaign would be overshadowed by the issue that hurts Blair most: trust. The line of attack will be obvious: \"He misled you over Iraq and those missing weapons of mass destruction. How can you believe a word he says about anything else?\" Labour's own private polling shows that while trust is a vote loser with Blair in charge, it would become a winner if Brown were at the helm. While the PM is badly mistrusted by voters, the chancellor enjoys a high positive rating. More practically, Blair must see that if he fights the next election, he will be dogged by the question of his planned tenure. Will he serve out his full term or not? He would not be able to duck that question easily. After all, voters have a right to know who is going to lead them. The government needs to get this question right. If it doesn't, the electorate will eventually sort things out for them. The choice is clear: Labour can renew itself calmly and deliberately while in office, or it can let the current dissension drag on until the voters give it a chance to renew itself in opposition. Anyone who prefers a Labour government to the prospect of Conservative rule has a stake in ensuring they sort this mess out. There is a last, larger reason to lance this boil, by whichever means. The plain truth is this: British troops went to kill and be killed last year on a false premise. We were told Saddam had WMD and he did not; we were told he was a threat to us and he was not. So far that act has brought no consequences on its perpetrators. Those who made bad errors in shedding light on the act - at the BBC and the Daily Mirror - have paid for their errors. But for the act itself, there has been no punishment. This suggests a failure of our very system of governance: it allowed a government to go to war in defiance of its people and on a false pretext and get away with it. The system needs to prove that it can correct itself - and to do it soon. j.freedland@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
