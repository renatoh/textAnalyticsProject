Claire Waxman said the domestic abuse bill, awaiting its second hearing in the House of Lords, did not provide adequate protection to abuse survivors and left many having to face abusers repeatedly, or pay for the cost of facilitating child contact arrangements. She is working with lawyers to submit an amendment to the bill to prevent the family courts ordering survivors to pay costs associated with their children having contact with the person who perpetrated the abuse. She said: \u201cI have seen countless cases where criminal courts have granted a protective order such as a restraining order, only for the family court to facilitate ongoing contact between survivor and perpetrator through repeated court hearings. \u201cI know of examples where courts have granted perpetrators significant control over their victim\u2019s life from afar, including mandating how many emails from their abuser they have to respond to in a week.\u201d Waxman\u2019s comments follow a session at the House of Lords last month during which survivors spoke of their experiences of the family court. She said: \u201cThe pervasive culture of \u2018contact at all costs\u2019 has put too many victims at risk of serious harm through unsafe child contact arrangements, sometimes in their own homes. And I\u2019m aware of many cases where these survivors have then been ordered to pay the costs to enable these unsafe arrangements. This is state-sanctioned abuse and it needs to stop.\u201d Current legislation allows the court to order which parents should pay for supervised contact or other costs. A criminal conviction is not necessarily a bar to a child having contact with the offending parent \u2013 or to both parents sharing the associated costs. Charlotte Proudman, a human rights barrister, said: \u201cI\u2019m seeing more and more that victims of domestic abuse are being ordered to pay 50% of child contact costs to alleged perpetrators \u2013 the vast majority of which are fathers who are not paying any child maintenance. Judges are not always giving due consideration to the parents\u2019 financial means.\u201d There have been cases in which victims of domestic abuse are ordered to pay half of the costs of their former partner\u2019s contact - typically \u00a3150 per session. In some instances, women have been forced to pay the costs of contact out of their universal credit. Lucy Reed, a family law barrister and chair of The Transparency Project charity, said: \u201cOnce the court has made a decision it is in the best interests of a child to have contact with both parents, it may well be the best way to facilitate that is by sharing the costs. \u201cIn my experience courts will make the best decisions they can knowing they have limited powers to enforce any financial aspect of their order and there is often no other source of funding.\u201d But she said judges should give fair weight to both parents\u2019 financial means. She added: \u201cCourts should be alive to the fact that where there are allegations of coercive or abusive behaviour there is a need to avoid inadvertently making orders that either jeopardise a caring parent\u2019s ability to provide for their child or that may inadvertently perpetuate financial control.\u201d One woman, a self-employed writer, told the Guardian she felt the family court had perpetuated the financial abuse she suffered in her abusive relationship after ordering her to undertake travel costs so her children could visit their father abroad. She said: \u201cThe court said he should come to England for some of the contact meetings but he refuses and will only take up the ones in his country. I\u2019m spending between \u00a3150 and \u00a3300 a month on train tickets.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWhere parents cannot agree on child contact arrangements, independent judges will determine if an order is appropriate and whether costs should be shared. \u201cIt is never acceptable for parents to evade their financial responsibilities to their children and the Child Maintenance Service will continue to clamp down on people who think they can abuse or dodge the system.\u201d This article was amended on 11 and 17 November 2020 to remove some details."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
