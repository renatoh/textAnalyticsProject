Sue Davey was confirmed as one of the victims in Friday\u2019s attack, along with her partner Scott Chalkley. The Premier League club released a statement on their website offering support to the devastated family. The statement read: \u201cLeicester City Football Club offers its sincerest condolences to Marc Albrighton, his partner Chloe and their family, after learning of the deaths of Chloe\u2019s mother, Sue, and her partner, Scott, during Friday\u2019s attacks in Tunisia. They are all in our thoughts and prayers. \u201cWe continue to offer our support to Marc and Chloe\u2019s family at this time of great personal tragedy.\u201d Ms Davey\u2019s son Conor Fulford, who had launched a social-media appeal for information regarding his mother, posted: \u201cThank you for willing me and my family on but unfortunately we lost the battle to keep my mom in our lives but don\u2019t worry mom, I\u2019m there and so is Daren Fulford to look after our two girls Chloe Lea Fulford and Rosy Fulford and all of our family. Love you forever.\u201d Mr Chalkley\u2019s son Ross Naylor confirmed his father\u2019s death via Twitter. He posted: \u201cTonight, me and Brad lost our dad. Unfortunately, he was caught up in the sickening attacks in Tunisia and is no longer with us. I feel I had to put this message out as many of you have been asking about him and asking for an update. I\u2019m sure many of you have seen the news about Sue as well, so all I ask is that people let both families grief in peace. We are all trying to come to grips and process with what\u2019s happened. I want to say thanks to everyone who has helped. You have all been amazing. One love to all. Rest in peace dad.\u201d Albrighton, a former Aston Villa winger, made 20 appearances for Leicester last season, scoring twice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
