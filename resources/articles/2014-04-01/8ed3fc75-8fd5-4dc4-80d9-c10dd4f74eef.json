Behind the scenes, however, the mood isn't quite as tranquil. There is reported tension between the \"white shirts\" \u2013 the managers \u2013 and \"purple shirts\" \u2013 the managed. There is disquiet about proposed new working arrangements that might mean longer hours worked and less pay for working weekends. Most of all, there has been disgruntlement about the failure of the top brass to pay the 350 visitor and security staff London's \u00a38.80 an hour living wage. On Tuesday, the TUC identified Britain's top living wage blackspots. Who knew the National Gallery was one of them? \u2022 There have been talks with the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) but there is, as yet, nothing like consensus. Trustees were warned last year that the gallery was expected to start paying the living wage on \u2026 1 April. As with so much on 1 April, that proved illusory. They were told things needed a lift \u2013 the number of grievances lodged suggesting \"an unhappy relationship between management and staff\". The gallery hopes to move to the living wage once new working practices and finances allow, apparently, but the purple shirts insist that day must come sooner rather than later. Matters aren't helped by the bonus paid to gallery director Nicholas Penny last year \u2013 \u00a328,000 on top of a \u00a3140,000 basic salary. \u2022 A more obvious disquiet impacts the London Symphony Orchestra. Gentle sorts waiting to see the LSO play at the Barbican the other day found themselves picketed by student protesters objecting to the orchestra's use of unpaid interns on six-month contracts. Critics say such schemes embed elitism because opportunities gravitate towards those rich enough to intern for free. Don't they have a point, we asked the LSO? No, the scheme doesn't entrench privilege, it said, and yes, it's confident it's within the law. But from September it is launching a new, paid internship scheme. Not a climbdown, you understand. Just a segue into something better. \u2022 George Osborne's ambition to achieve full employment, meanwhile, finds a receptive ear in the Daily Mail. In the case of Alastair Campbell, the Mail can boast a direct role in securing its hated critic a new job. Explaining his decision to hire Campbell as a big beast interviewer, GQ editor Dylan Jones says the idea \"was hatched when I saw him on BBC2's Newsnight last October demolishing the Daily Mail's deputy editor Jon Steafel because of his paper's decision to accuse Ed Miliband's father Ralph of 'hating Britain'.\" Alastair does like the rough stuff. But loathing the Mail probably helped. \u2022 Less than a week in and no sign yet of the first gay divorce. These things take time; we are playing catch-up. But there are bound to be problems. According to the Catholic weekly the Universe, gays did not actually want gay marriage. Indeed, editor Joe Kelly suggests that the gay marriage legislation \"may actually have set gay rights back decades\". Apparently there were \"very few voices within the gay community calling for this measure\". So who did want gay marriage? Look no further than \"the largely middle-class heterosexuals with a predilection for social engineering of the type that wrecks everyone else's backyard, but leaves theirs unaffected\". He's right. We yearned for gay married couples to be ridiculed in BBC sitcoms like everyone else. \u2022 Finally, we are undeterred but find it is not as easy as one might hope to obtain copies of Chris Grayling's 1987 masterwork Land Fit for Heroes: Life in Britain After the Great War. A subversive lawyer-type hopes to find 550 copies to mail to his clients in prison, thereby confronting the justice secretary's possibly illegal ban on books with books of his own. There was a copy on eBay. That went for 99p, with \u00a36 postage. A few more on Amazon, but prices there range from \u00a34.95 to \u00a388. Tricky. Maybe time for a rethink. Couldn't we just send all those Bibles foisted on schools by Michael Gove?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
