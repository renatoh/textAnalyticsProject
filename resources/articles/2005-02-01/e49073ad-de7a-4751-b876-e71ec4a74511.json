The deal represented the largest piece of business on the final day of the transfer window and means that Spurs have signed eight players in a month. Tottenham's determination to establish themselves among the Premiership's elite has cost them around \u00a311m in four transfers, three loan deals and a pre-contract agreement for Auxerre's Finnish midfielder Teemu Tainio. Forest, in stark contrast, can look forward to a bleak future, with the majority of the \u00a38m potentially required to address the effects of dropping into League One. The club are seven points adrift of safety in the Championship and by selling their two prized assets they have undermined any chance of avoiding relegation. Reid and Dawson are products of the same academy that nurtured the Newcastle vice-captain Jermaine Jenas and the Southampton midfielder David Prutton. Reid, a left-sided playmaker of genuine menace, is now an established Republic of Ireland international and over the past year has arguably been the most stylish player outside the Premiership. Southampton had been willing to pay \u00a33m for the 22-year-old as well as offering two of their fringe players, Darren Kenton and Brett Ormerod, but Reid has had his heart set on a move to White Hart Lane since they offered \u00a35m plus Rohan Ricketts for him a year ago. Dawson, an England Under-21 international, has suffered from a series of injuries and the imperious form he showed in his formative days at the City Ground has given way to a number of erratic displays over the past six months. Yet Tottenham are entitled to believe that the 21-year-old will justify his transfer value if he can reproduce the type of performance that convinced the England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson to invite him to join the national squad for a training camp after only a handful of club appearances. Liverpool under G\u00e9rard Houllier had tried to sign Dawson and two years ago Sir Alex Ferguson made a request to Paul Hart, the then Forest manager, to be kept informed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
