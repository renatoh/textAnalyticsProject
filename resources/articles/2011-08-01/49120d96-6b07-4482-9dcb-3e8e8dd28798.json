Six obstetrics specialists say the latest expert survey in the UK \"highlights a worrying trend in the causes of maternal mortality in the UK\" and that many deaths are caused by substandard medical care. The death rate has dropped dramatically since the 1950s, when women used to die frequently of pregnancy and birth complications, such as haemorrhage and ectopic pregnancy (where the fertilised egg develops in the fallopian tube instead of the womb). But this fall has masked a rise in deaths from other causes such as asthma, epilepsy, diabetes and heart failure, that should have been detected and dealt with before the birth. Most maternal deaths in the UK now occur in women who were already suffering from medical or psychiatric conditions, say Catherine Nelson-Piercy, professor of obstetric medicine at King's College London, and colleagues. The leading cause of death is cardiac disease and the second is neurological disease, according to the latest Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths published in March. \"Most worryingly, the number of maternal deaths due to indirect causes has significantly increased over the past 20 years. Furthermore, most of these deaths are associated with substandard care, and in one third of cases this is classified as major substandard care, where different care might have prevented the death of the mother,\" they write in an editorial published online by the British Medical Journal. \"These failings require urgent attention.\" The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths \u2013 an audit carried out by professionals which has been running since 1952 \u2013 has repeatedly highlighted the same issues, including failure to properly diagnose, investigate and treat women with chest pain, headache or other medical symptoms, they say. \"This often arises when well-meaning clinicians prioritise the health of the foetus over that of the mother, but it can result in the death of both mother and foetus,\" they write. It cannot be expected that obstetricians and midwives, who deal with pregnancy and birth, can bring down the number of deaths from underlying causes on their own \u2013 physicians and GPs have to play a part too, says the editorial. But many doctors are not sufficiently aware of the interactions between pregnancy and medical disease, nor of what is safe and desirable with regard to the use of medication in pregnancy and radiology examinations. The authors cite a woman who died from her asthma after the GP told her to stop taking her drugs during pregnancy. As well as more training for hospital doctors and GPs, the authors recommend that more obstetric physicians should be recruited \u2013 hospital doctors who would specialise in the treatment of pregnant women who have underlying disease. As more and more women give birth later in life, have high blood pressure as a result of obesity and conceive after transplant surgery or other treatment that would have ruled out a baby in the past, more obstetric physicians are going to be essential, they say."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
