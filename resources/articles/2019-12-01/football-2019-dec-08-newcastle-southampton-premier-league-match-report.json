Until Bruce\u2019s introduced Andy Carroll and, a little later, Sean Longstaff from the bench, his side looked in real peril of losing. Instead the newcomers created game-changing goals for Jonjo Shelvey and Federico Fern\u00e1ndez, leaving Southampton back in the bottom three and rueing a failure to capitalise on their hosts\u2019 slow start. Newcastle are up to 10th but their first-half performance was more redolent of a side jaded by a Thursday night European tie at Spartak Moscow or Shakhtar Donetsk rather than a Premier League victory at Sheffield United. Slapdash and slow, laboured and lumpen, they sleepwalked into unforced errors and had Martin Dubravka to thank for two fine saves from the impressive Nathan Redmond in the wake of a dreadful Jetro Willems error. With the home side all over the place Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s sole concern must have been that his Southampton players were not good enough to take full advantage. \u201cTo be honest I could only see my team winning,\u2019 he said. \u201cThen Andy Carroll came on and he\u2019s not easy to defend against, he\u2019s 10 feet tall. We have to be more clinical but in the second half Newcastle were a different team, he gave them a big lift.\u201d Bruce did not demur. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say the first half was a non-event,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were nowhere near the levels we needed. But when I brought Andy on it was like the Andy Carroll of 10 years ago; he lifted the crowd and helped win us the match. He instantly made a big difference.\u201d While no one would disagree, the only reason Carroll was able to alter the narrative so easily is down to Allan Saint-Maximin\u2019s invaluable groundwork in softening Southampton up. Despite playing with a painful ankle injury, the former Nice winger turned Tyneside cult hero seemed immune from the fatigue afflicting his team-mates and single-handedly attempted to raise the tone. One particular eye-catching cameo saw his rapid change of pace and close control sweep him past three markers before crossing brilliantly. Without Saint-Maximin advance\u2019s to fret about, Southampton would surely have been free to concentrate on their finishing and the only concern is that the Frenchman collapsed in stoppage-time with a worrying look hamstring injury and left the ground on crutches. \u201cI\u2019ll kick myself if he\u2019s out for a long time,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cThat\u2019s the downside of playing somebody when they\u2019re tired but he\u2019s been crucial to us.\u201d Goodness knows where Southampton would be without Danny Ings. The second half had barely begun before the striker scored his fifth goal in five games. It arrived after Fabian Sch\u00e4r \u2013 newly on for Ciaran Clark \u2013 misread Jack Stephens\u2019s long punt forward and Ings shrugged off Fern\u00e1ndez before shooting low beneath Dubravka. It was time for Carroll to replace the ineffective Joelinton and Bruce\u2019s very own divine ponytail made a near instant impact. When a Shelvey free kick seemed to have been cleared Carroll won the ball back, chasing it down to the touchline, before delivering a superb left-foot cross from the right for Shelvey, by now surging late into the box, to register his third goal in three games by heading past Alex McCarthy from 10 yards. Noting his side\u2019s legs wobbling and their concentration wavering, Bruce sent Longstaff on to tighten the midfield and, very quickly, he unleashed a shot McCarthy could only parry, leaving Fern\u00e1ndez revelling in lashing the rebound home. Longstaff then emphasised his importance at the other end courtesy of a splendid stoppage-time block to deny Ryan Bertrand and ensure his side reached the 22-point mark. It is worth noting that last season, under Rafael Ben\u00edtez, it took them until late January to accumulate that tally."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
