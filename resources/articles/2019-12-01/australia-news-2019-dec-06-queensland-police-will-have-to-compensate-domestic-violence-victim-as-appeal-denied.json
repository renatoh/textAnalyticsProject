The decision likely brings an end to the long-running breach of privacy case brought by Julie*, whose address was sent by a senior constable to her abusive former partner, and who represented herself against the state. \u201cI\u2019m so happy that this is finally over and I have found justice for what has happened to my family and I,\u201d Julie told Guardian Australia. \u201cI have fought my hardest for every woman and child that has ever been in this system or yet to be, and I wish for them to not give up.\u201d The Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal on Friday refused to allow police to appeal a finding that they were liable for breaching Julie\u2019s privacy, after the state bungled its paperwork and missed a deadline. The decision means that police will not have the opportunity to contest the initial tribunal ruling that found they were responsible for the breach as they did not take reasonable steps to prevent access. Guardian Australia understands other police data misuse victims had been eagerly awaiting the outcome of the process and that the initial QCAT finding could now be used as the basis for a potential class action against the state. \u201cI\u2019m aware there are other cases pending finality against the QPS,\u201d Julie said. \u201cAnd I hope this decision will help them.\u201d The tribunal\u2019s latest ruling was scathing about police, who filed appeal paperwork late and then took more than a month to apply for an extension. Police were represented by the government\u2019s legal arm, crown law, and a QC. Julie ran her own case. \u201c[Julie] has experienced inordinate delays and uncertainties by the QPS\u2019 actions (or inactions) in this unnecessarily protracted matter,\u201d tribunal member John Forbes said in his judgement. \u201cThere is no good reason to doubt the citizen\u2019s complaint that, as a result, she suffered considerable stress and anxiety.\u201d Forbes said the state had a responsibility to act as a model litigant and had not provided a satisfactory reason for its delay in filing appeal applications. The decision also assessed the potential merits of the police appeal and found there was \u201cno real prospect\u201d it would succeed. As the case has dragged on now for several years \u2013 through disciplinary, criminal and civil proceedings \u2013 it has become increasingly embarrassing for the state and police. Recently the police minister, Mark Ryan, said it had gone on long enough and that he wanted it resolved. Revelations have included allegations of reprisals against an officer who assisted Julie in QCAT. That compensation will come as a result of a tribunal order \u2013 which the state fought against \u2013 rather than an attempt to settle the matter in good faith will further compound that embarrassment. It also comes amid an inquiry by the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission into public sector data misuse that heard there were high rates of breaches among police and a lack of measures to protect high-risk potential victims. The police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, has admitted to the inquiry that individual officers had brought the service into disrepute. Guardian Australia understands police had pursued the case and the appeal \u2013 despite the public relations issues created by dragging a domestic violence victim through a court process \u2013 because it was concerned about the implications of the initial ruling if applied to other data breaches. QCAT found that the Queensland police service had breached two of the state\u2019s information privacy principles. Member Susan Gardiner found in March that police had no systematic auditing process for regulating how officers used or misused the data of citizens, and that she could not be satisfied the QPS took all reasonable measures to prevent unauthorised use of the QPrime data system or the disclosure of personal information. \u201cThe evidence before me is the QPS had no systematic auditing procedures of access to the QPrime system \u2013 even for at-risk groups such as domestic violence victims,\u201d the judgment said. \u201cIt simply relied on a complaint or an incident to highlight a breach. The system of auditing after the fact allows for circumstances where catastrophic events involving [Julie] and the safety of her family could have occurred. \u201c[Police] did not audit in a systemic way to supervise access even to a group of people (domestic violence victims) who had orders in their favour. The service waited until there was a complaint or an incident, at a time after any further potential damage to this vulnerable group.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
