Abi Morgan said people in all walks of life deal with \u201cemotional situations that fracture their minds\u201d, prompting her to write the six-part series starring Stellan Skarsgard, the Swedish actor best known for his roles in films by Lars von Trier. Morgan, who has written adaptations of Brick Lane and Birdsong, said she often talked out loud to herself \u2013 like the lead character John River, played by Skarsgard \u2013 and said \u201cfrom anyone else\u2019s perspective, I must look mad\u201d. \u201cI felt that writing this was a way to explore my own mental health. I talk to myself all the time \u2013 it\u2019s something my children have observed in the car. I\u2019ll often have the argument with the person that I really want to say to their face,\u201d she told the new issue of Radio Times. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019ve been on the tube and I\u2019ve been thinking about something, and I\u2019ll see someone looking at me, and I\u2019ll think, \u2018God! I\u2019m talking out loud.\u2019 And I realise that from anyone else\u2019s perspective, I must look mad. \u201cI wanted to say, \u2018In police departments, in hospitals, in newsrooms, in the banking industry, we have people who are dealing with emotional situations that fracture their minds\u2019 and so that\u2019s what made me start to write this.\u201d The story of a London detective who suffers a massive psychotic event when he loses his partner, River co-stars Eddie Marsan (Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell) as the manifestation of Thomas Cream, the long-dead Lambeth Poisoner and a real life 19th century killer. River is one of the flagship dramas of BBC1\u2019s autumn season and launches at a critical time for the corporation with its future size and funding under scrutiny as part of the government\u2019s review of its royal charter. BBC1 controller Charlotte Moore said the drama pushed the cop show genre \u201cin surprising ways\u201d and promised last month that every new commission on the channel would look to \u201cbreak the mould\u201d. Morgan said: \u201cThe actual mechanics of a cop show are incredibly hard \u2026 and so to invigorate that was incredibly difficult. The whole piece is about acts of violence and how acts of violence can shatter you, and I wanted to look at a true psychotic character.\u201d The drama comes at a time when celebrities such as Stephen Fry and Ruby Wax have spoken of the need for society to address mental wellbeing in the same way as physical health. Nicola Walker (Last Tango in Halifax, Spooks) who plays River\u2019s partner, Jackie \u201cStevie\u201d Stevenson, said mental health issues were not directly referenced in the drama. \u201cI don\u2019t think Stevie thinks he [River] has a mental health issue; he is who he is, and she only sees great advantages to the way he navigates the world,\u201d she said ahead of the series launch next Tuesday. One of the industry\u2019s most acclaimed and versatile writers \u2013 her latest film, Suffragette, starring Carey Mulligan, is released this month \u2013 Morgan said she missed BBC2\u2019s The Hour, the Dominic West drama that was axed after two series, and regretted removing a riot from her film adaptation of Monica Ali\u2019s Brick Lane. \u201cI took it out because I felt it didn\u2019t happen \u2013 forgetting, of course, that it\u2019s a work of fiction and dramatically it\u2019s much needed,\u201d she said. Morgan, whose parents divorced when she was a teenager, is now researching a series about divorce. \u201cI\u2019m writing about divorce lawyers and it\u2019s fascinating. My parents\u2019 divorce was very difficult. Divorce is essentially incredibly painful, but it\u2019s also an essential part of life.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
