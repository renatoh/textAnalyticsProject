Watson has owned the New Zealand Warriors club since 2000, and his clash with the South Sydney fanatic Crowe two years ago was triggered by the pair's mutual love of league, if not of each other. The Warriors are bottom of the National Rugby League, just below Souths, and Watson's business interests - including the PowerHouse electrical chain - are increasingly concentrated in England. The Broncos have been encouraged by suggestions that he is ready to follow in the footsteps of Richard Branson, whose Virgin group cut their losses on rugby league in the capital two years ago. \"We're always in the market for new investors provided they are of the right calibre, and Eric would fit the profile perfectly,\" said London's chief executive Nic Cartwright. \"He's been to a couple of our games and he obviously loves his league. So we know him, we know he's in London, and I gather he's got a bit of money. We'd love to hear from him.\" The Broncos have been struggling financially since Virgin withdrew their backing two years ago, with only the continued support of their chairman David Hughes, a trader on the gas exchange who grew up in Swinton, allowing them to maintain their Super League place. However, after flirting dangerously with relegation for most of this season, they will celebrate the 10th anniversary of a previous takeover by the Brisbane Broncos in next Sunday's home game against Warrington in buoyant mood. Consecutive wins against Wigan, Widnes and last Friday at St Helens have almost certainly secured their safety for another season. The West London Sharks, one of the Broncos' feeder clubs, hope that Trevor Leota, the Wasps and Samoa rugby union hooker, will be cleared to play in their totalrl.com Conference semi-final against Ipswich on Sunday. Leota, who played league as a teenager, has been guesting for the Sharks for the last month with permission from the Wasps director of rugby Warren Gatland. Last weekend he helped them to a 30-18 win at Bridgend Blue Bulls, the conference champions, who included the former Wales internationals Allan Bateman, Kevin Ellis and John Devereux. Leeds have awarded a testimonial, and therefore a new one-year contract, to their Great Britain prop Barrie McDermott. The 32-year-old has made more than 300 appearances for the Rhinos since joining them from Wigan. Terry O'Connor, McDermott's best man, who has been out for two months with an ankle injury, is set to return for Wigan in Friday's game against St Helens. Saints are still waiting to hear from Jamie Lyon, a 22-year-old centre who toured with the Kangaroos in 2001 but gave up his contract with the Parramatta Eels this year to play amateur rugby in Wee Waa, his home town in the New South Wales interior. The St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus has confirmed that Lyon is their first choice to replace Martin Gleeson, the Great Britain centre who was sold to Warrington for \u00a3200,000 last month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
