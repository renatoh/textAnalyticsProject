Against Japan they were a slender 12-7 ahead at half-time before imposing themselves; against the USA they trailed 13-6; and they needed a half-time lecture from their coach, Vern Cotter, to get their act together against Samoa, one of the more disappointing sides at the World Cup. Before Cotter\u2019s words, Scotland had leaked tries at an alarming rate and but for some poor kicking by the Samoa No10 Tusi Pisi and a gifted try from the fly-half, the game could have been beyond them. After the defeat by South Africa, a side who did not waste the gift of a lacklustre Scottish start, Cotter said they had learned from that performance. Nonetheless at the end of the game on Saturday, his captain Greig Laidlaw admitted it was the coach\u2019s words which again saw them through before Richie Gray, the lock who was celebrating his 50th cap, hammered the point home, warning there would be no second chance against Australia. \u201cWe have to improve,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIf we put in a first-half performance like that the game will be over. It is a tough one. From an attacking point of view we got points on the board and were pretty decent. Defensively we turned over the ball too much and you can\u2019t do that. We need to get that right this weekend.\u201d In fact it took an hour for Scotland to get their noses in front and Duncan Hodge, one of Cotter\u2019s assistant coaches, said: \u201cIn terms of answers, I think we just have to be absolutely clear on what we\u2019re trying to do. We know what Samoa are going to bring. We\u2019ve got to get our game right but we also have to be adaptable to the way they\u2019re going to play. With every game of international rugby you set your stuff out but it doesn\u2019t always pan out like that.\u201d Hodge questioned whether in the games against South Africa and Samoa, Scotland either took too long adapting or did not adapt at all. \u201cTwenty minutes in against South Africa we hadn\u2019t had any ball, we kicked a couple away,\u201d said Hodge. \u201cAs coaches and as players we\u2019re saying we should have adapted to that quicker. We should have recognised the problems and solved the issues. For us as a team that\u2019s what it\u2019s about \u2013 international rugby\u2019s a tough place and we have to adapt slightly quicker.\u201d After conceding more than 60% of the possession in the first two quarters on Saturday, Scotland finally got their act together after Cotter\u2019s lecture and denied Samoa a sniff of any decent ball in the third quarter, sparking a glut of penalties that helped wipe out the half-time lead built with tries from Tusi Pisi, Manu Leiataua and Reynold Lee-Lo. Had Laidlaw not chosen to go for something more ambitious on three occasions and then missed two more kicks, the lead might have been far more than three points at the end of the third quarter, but it was enough. Laidlaw\u2019s late try, cancelled out by a fourth Samoa try, scored by the replacement hooker Motu Matu\u2019u, caused a few Scottish jitters in the 75 seconds remaining but there was a huge sigh of relief as the Scots in the 50,000-strong crowd, most of them in Newcastle for the day, counted down the dying seconds and then headed for the bars around Gallowgate. Stephen Betham, who has admitted his part in Samoa\u2019s alarming fall from grace, said he was proud of his team\u2019s performance but put his finger on the fault that undermined what could have been a winning performance. \u201cIn the second half we conceded 13 penalties, you can\u2019t win a Test match if you give away that many penalties,\u201d the coach said, and might have added that the quartet who did the damage were the Scotland back-row of Ryan Wilson, John Hardie and David Denton, plus Glasgow\u2019s converted South African Josh Strauss when he made his second-half arrival. \u201cIt comes down to attitude I think,\u201d Strauss said when asked about Scotland\u2019s slow starting habit. \u201cThe World Cup\u2019s a big stage, it\u2019s an arm-wrestle. It\u2019s been tight in the first halves but we\u2019ve got the fitness and character to pull it through in the second half \u2013 that\u2019s also a good sign.\u201d However, against Australia this Sunday, who put in a remarkably disciplined performance when down to 13 men against Wales, they are unlikely to get the second chance offered by Japan, the USA and Samoa.
