They put questions to the MP who represents the House of Commons commission. Usually these are whinges about the availability of tea cakes, arrangements for visits by constituents or something similar. But yesterday we heard an extraordinary story. Anthony Steen, Tory MP for Totnes, declared that \"in view of the fact that hair brushes and combs have been removed from the members' cloakrooms, because of the risk of HIV and the spread of lice ...\" HIV and the spread of lice? From hairbrushes and combs? What could he be on about? The Speaker intervened to point out that the question had nothing to do with tonsorial care but was about new office space. However, nothing stops Mr Steen when he has seized the bone of controversy and is determined to chew it all over the hearthrug of public debate. He sprang up again and asked if, before new offices are occupied, they should have combs and hair brushes installed for members no longer able to find them in the Gents. The Speaker looked as if he wished he could be anywhere else. The G8 is about to meet. Iraq is still in chaos. Global warming is nearing the top of the world's agenda. Bob Geldof believes we can make poverty history. Now he had an MP fretting about hair care. \"Hon. members can bring their own combs,\" he said wearily. It is, as so often, a class thing. In the kind of clubs and hotels frequented by Tory MPs, you do see combs and hair brushes in the toilets, for general use. But I doubt very much that you would find an ivory-backed hair brush in the lavatory of the Glasgow North-east Labour Club, or wherever Mr Martin takes his ease. And not being upper class myself, I prefer not to use a brush or a comb that has run through other people's hair. In the same way, I have my own toothbrush, and prefer new, unused, toilet paper. But that was not the point, Mr Steen told me when, in my role as an investigative sketch writer, I called him for further details. \"This is how absurd this place has become!\" he told me. Apparently the health and safety people have now banned kettles in the little kitchenettes MPs use to make tea and toast. Instead, they have installed cisterns, which are permanently full of boiling water. \"My secretary has worked here for years, and has never burned herself with a kettle. But she was badly scalded by one of these new things!\" He kindly sent me the health and safety risk assessment form that has created this problem. Under \"Hazard identification\" it says: \"Combs and hair brushes left in washrooms for general usage ... potential exposure to bodily fluid, i.e. blood, if somebody's scalp is cut whilst using comb or hair brush. \"Hepatitis or HIV risk. Could spread head lice eggs.\" It goes on to point out that the likelihood of passing on HIV is \"extremely low\", but because if it did happen, the consequences would be so serious that steps should be taken to eliminate any risk. In the same way, if you go for a walk in the countryside, it is very unlikely that you will be abducted by space aliens from the planet Thaarg. But if you were, it would be very unpleasant, so better stay indoors, just to be on the safe side. And whatever you do, don't get Mr Steen started on the new regulations concerning the serving of jam in the members' tea room."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
