Feathers must have flown in Threadneedle Street on 4 August, when Mervyn King and his hawkish supporters were outmanoeuvred by five doves, to deliver the cut in interest rates the markets had been hoping for. So much for the governor of the Bank of England intellectually strong-arming the committee into agreeing with him, as some bank-watchers feared would happen when he took over at the top two years ago. As the minutes published last week revealed, the Monetary Policy Committee's 100th meeting since the Bank gained independence in 1997 was also the first at which a governor was on the losing side. The relationship between the four hawkish Bank insiders, and their five rate-cutting opponents - including King's chief economist, Charlie Bean - would be good material for a thesis on group psychology. But what made the governor's defeat so interesting, was that it illustrated the unusually deep split within the committee concerning the health of the economy. Hopes that the rate cut would be the first of many had already begun to fade after King's tough performance at the Bank's quarterly Inflation Report press briefing 10 days ago. He produced a pair of graphs, showing that if rates fell several times, as the City was then expecting, inflation would soar well above its 2 per cent target in two years' time. But leaving rates unchanged, at 4.5 per cent, would bring inflation neatly back to target - as the Bank is expecting economic growth to recover and put upward pressure on inflation in the coming months. King's hawkish camp gave two reasons for this analysis. First, the pound has been depreciating since they last took the temperature of the economy three months ago. Businesses have long whinged that sterling is overvalued, and the hawks hope that firms which can sell their goods more cheaply to the global market will perform more strongly. Second, King mentioned higher equity prices as a reason to be cheerful. Presumably, that is because he hopes firms will be coaxed into splashing out on new projects and boosting business investment - one source of economic demand which has so far stubbornly failed to recover. In other words, not for the first time in the past few years, we are waiting for a corporate resurgence, so that consumers can continue to ease their foot off the spending pedal without causing economic growth to plunge. The problem with this elegant theory is that this re-balancing, away from booming spending pumped up by an overheated housing market towards stronger exports and business investment, is exactly what King and his colleagues have been hoping for, for a long time. It is this 'soft landing' scenario which the five increases in interest rates through 2003 and 2004 were meant to bring about. If businesses would take up the running, overstretched households could start to get their finances back in order without jeopardising the rest of the economy. However, the fact that the Monetary Policy Committee has now lost its nerve and cut rates shows that, like the recovery in Gordon Brown's public finances, the mythical re-balancing has so far only happened in charts forecasting the future - charts that then have to be redrawn when the present fails to match up. King brushed aside criticism of the Bank's forecasting record at the Inflation Report briefing with a joke about the Chancellor's change to his 'golden rule'. But the fact is, the Bank has had to move a long way in the past nine months. Homeowners have stubbornly refused to behave in accordance with the MPC's analysis, which said the link between the housing market and consumer spending had broken. Since property price growth began to slow last year, spending has suffered badly too. Retailers probably protest too much, and official figures from June and July showed that there was not quite the apocalypse on the high street some had complained about. But nevertheless, the Bank has been taken by surprise at the seriousness of the spending slowdown. The many analysts who think the hawks have got it wrong believe this misunderstanding of consumers is at the heart of the Bank's recent ropey forecasting record. And although the feared housing market 'crash' has not yet materialised, the ripples of the downturn, that we have already seen, are still spreading out through the economy. In spring last year, homeowners were still used to seeing the price of their prize property whizz up at 20 per cent each year. This year, they will be lucky if their homes increase in value at all. Whatever the Bank's complex models tell it, it is hard to imagine the spending habits of homeowners being completely unaffected by such a dramatic change in the earning power of property - most people's biggest investment. And the jolt to both property and retailing we have already seen will inevitably have knock-on effects. Unemployment increased for the sixth successive month in July - the latest straw in the wind suggesting that the impact of the housing market slowdown, and the resultant consumer spending squeeze, is still working itself out. Danny Gabay, of Fathom Consulting, notes that employment has fallen most among the age groups of 18-24-year-olds, and 25-34 year-olds - those which (I can ruefully confirm) tend to borrow and spend the most. So there is likely to be worse to come on the consumer front, which means King's hopeful prognosis for wider economic growth from a happier business sector becomes all the more crucial. Unfortunately, however, both the Bank's reasons for expecting a more balanced economy seem risky. Britain's manufacturers admit that the health of their biggest market, the eurozone, is more important to them than the strength of the pound. Some say a cut in eurozone rates would be more helpful to them than cheaper borrowing costs here. And the link between stock prices and growth is pretty uncertain too: there is a danger that a 10 per cent increase in the FTSE since the beginning of the year will be too little to persuade firms that were burnt by the overinvestment of the hi-tech boom years, to start spending again. Inflation did jump well above target, to 2.3 per cent, last month, apparently boosting the hawks' hopes that demand was picking up. But a large part of that increase has been due to high oil prices - which could also bear down on household spending. A few more quid a week spent filling the tank means a bit less to blow on a meal out. Seen from that point of view, the inflation figures were a reminder of yet another risk to growth, bolstering the doves' case. The oil price surge is one of a number of factors making the economy tricky to read at the moment. Bulls and bears in the City are just as divided as the hawks and doves at the Bank, and the truth is that it will take several months for the corporate sector to spring into action, or the housing market to take a heavier toll on consumers, or both. It will be some time before we can look back and see the past few months as the end of a soft patch, or the beginning of a crash. My money's on the doves. \u00b7 William Keegan is on holiday"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
