Local government workers appear to be the latest victims of the council tax crisis, with local authorities seeing their finances squeezed as a result of intense government pressure to keep this year's round of increases to low single figures. The second round of pay talks for the country's 1.3 million council workers ended in stalemate after dismayed unions heard council employers' formal response to their joint pay claim, submitted earlier this year. Local government unions Unison, GMB and T&amp;G demanded a 4% pay rise and a local government minimum wage of \u00a36 an hour. But council bosses instead offered an average annual rise of just over 2%. Emerging from a tense and brief meeting of the national joint council, made up of union and employer representatives, union officials said the employers' \"insulting\" offer would fail to deliver decent pay to hardworking local public service workers. The Employers Organisation announced its terms on the day that a survey carried out by Unison revealed that 30% of council staff are seriously considering quitting the profession, partly as a result of poor pay and conditions. Heather Wakefield, head of local government for Unison, said: \"This pay offer is a bitter blow for local communities and staff who provide services. \"It will do nothing to deal with the root cause of the recruitment and retention crisis across local government - low pay and poor career prospects. Councils will be forced to pay millions of pounds over the odds in agency fees just to plug vacancies.\" Mick Graham, GMB national secretary for public services, said the offer was a \"slap in the face\" for workers. \"It does not address key issues affecting public service workers\", he said. \"The government's modernisation plans cannot be achieved under this derisory offer. It would exacerbate recruitment and retention problems already facing vital services in our communities.\" Peter Allenson, the T&amp;G's national secretary, added:\"This offer would set our members back rather than forward. We made a breakthrough on tackling low pay and unequal pay following the national strike of 2002 and the unions intend to build on that progress. \"Local government employers are going to have to think again if they want the services the public and government demand.\" This year's pay talks are taking place in the wake of a report carried out by the Pay Commission on council workers' pay and conditions of service. Mike Walker, EO director of negotiations defended the bosses' offer, claiming that many of the recommendations laid out by the commission had been taken on board, blaming the low pay deal on council tax pressures. \"We presented a package which was designed to take the Pay Commission's framework and supports service delivery\", he said. \"We outlined a range of issues to the trade unions which will start improving the [pay] inequalities agenda through local pay reviews. \"We also dealt with concerns raised by staff side on training and development. When you consider pay you have to take into account a number of factors including what we can afford. The pressure on councils is very intense at the moment.\" Local government employers want wide-ranging reforms to accompany a three-year pay agreement, to bring about improvements to service delivery. They want to scrap premium rates for shift, evening, overtime and weekend working and replace them with a set of principles recommended by the Pay Commission in 2003. Also in adherence with the commission's recommendations, local workforce development plans will be rolled out to tackle the paucity of training and career development available to the wider council workforce. The six-point plan includes a commitment to completing job evaluations across councils within three years, in accordance with the single status agreement, which was jointly signed by unions and employers in 1997 to eradicate unequal pay. This extends the time period desired by unions, who want to see this protracted commitment concluded within the next two years. Council bosses also propose a joint review of conditions of service, embracing car allowances, annual leave, sickness pay and leave, and maternity and paternity pay and leave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
