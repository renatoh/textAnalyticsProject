Three weeks tomorrow in fact, but the frequent promises of clarification have never materialised. Frankly, we're still puzzled. Could it be, we asked, that the donor \u2013 who has given the party enough to become part of David Cameron's elite Leader's Club \u2013 is John Edwin Dodd, the investment type who co-founded Artemis fund management group? John Edwin Dodd, the multimillionaire owner of the Glenogil shooting estate, in Angus, Tayside, who last year had his farming subsidy cut by \u00a3107,000 by the Scottish executive \u2013 a record sanction \u2013 after police found highly toxic and illegal pesticides on bait. We thought it best to ask because it would seem strange for the Tories, who say they will do all to protect our green and pleasant land, to be taking money from one judged by the authorities to be imperilling it, despite his continued claims of innocence. The days have passed since we asked. Since then, nothing from him, nothing from them. Too little love to be found among the representatives of the people in Brussels and Strasbourg now Dave's new political talisman, the rightwing Pole Michal Kaminski, is threatening to sue one of his old champions. Edward McMillan-Scott says the new man is a homophobe and worse. Much worse. Kaminski takes exception to this. All a bit unseemly. And it's an uphill struggle, it seems, for Nick Griffin to find firm friends at his new place of work, for the talk is of a row with Jean-Marie Le Pen in a meeting of all the \"non-aligned\" MEPs, who had been unable to form a grouping. Still, the British extremist was able to have a beer with Roberto \"If you call me a neo-fascist I won't kick up a fuss\" Fiore, the Italian MEP who's the head of the Forza Nuova party. It's early days. He'll learn the ropes. And it is to be hoped that he's counting the pennies, for money's tight, and todaywe learned the party has just lost a tidy sum in a funding debacle. It received a \u00a31,000 donation in February from a Mr A Romilly \u2013 who wasn't, it turns out, on the electoral register. It was in fact illegal. And so the party sent the money back and told the Electoral Commission, but it did it all so slowly that it incurred a \u00a31,000 penalty. One day it was \u00a31,000 up. The next \u00a32,000 out of pocket. Still, there doesn't appear to be any rancour, for in May, one Adrian Romilly stood as a BNP candidate for the south-west in the European elections. He lost, but he's obviously keen. And enthusiasm is half the battle, but one nevertheless feels for the organisers of the Tour de France as they wonder how best to accommodate the nation's number one cyclist, Nicolas Sarkozy. The lycra stays at home, and he will follow the 17th stage of the race next Wednesday through the French Alps in the car driven by the tour's director. As long as no cyclists overtake him, that will be fine. Finally, who is having fun at the expense of Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota (pictured). The Facebook account looks authentic, it is true, with friends such as Alastair Campbell. But those who know these things were quickly able to expose it as a fake. There was, we are told, one outstanding clue: \"his\" invitation for Charles Thomson, leader of the \"Stuckist painters\" and Serota's avowed enemy, to become friends with him with the unlikely message: \"As I've said to the press, I do admire your work and while we have aesthetic differences I think we should be friends.\" Thomson it was who alerted the press to the fact that the Tate had purchased a work by Chris Ofili for \u00a3705,000 while the artist was a serving Tate trustee. The Tate was obliged to apologise. In time, the two men may settle their differences \u2013 but it hasn't happened yet, and the advice is don't hold your breath."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
