Chris Hill, its chief executive, said he shared clients\u2019 disappointment and frustration after the closure of the Woodford equity income fund which prevented investors from cashing out of the ailing investment vehicle. Hill said he backed research through Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s Wealth 50 list of top buys that recommended investors pick Woodford over better-performing fund managers. Woodford, one of the UK\u2019s best-known stockpickers, suspended all trading in the fund \u201cuntil further notice\u201d after being overwhelmed by customer withdrawals following a series of bad market bets. Hill said: \u201cI would like to apologise personally to all clients who have been impacted by the recent problems with the Woodford equity income fund. We all share their disappointment and frustration. Our priority right now is to support our clients and keep them informed.\u201d Woodford said last week the fund would reopen as soon as was \u201cpracticable after these exceptional circumstances have ceased\u201d, and that the suspension would be reviewed \u201cat least every 28 days\u201d. Hill said: \u201cThe shortcomings of one fund should not detract from the benefits of favourite fund lists like the Wealth 50.\u201d His firm has come under fire from investors who will not be able to access their investments until the suspension is lifted. Investors have also criticised the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, for failing to see the risks taken by Woodford. The former City minister Lord Myners said the FCA \u201cshould have been awake\u201d to problems at the fund, telling the BBC that the regulator had missed \u201cclear warning signs\u201d that things were going badly. On Thursday, Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee, said investors should not be charged management fees while trading in the fund was suspended. Concerns were raised last year after a series of poor performances by companies part-owned by Woodford funds, many of them not listed on the stock market, making them difficult to sell. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, defended the regulator and Woodford\u2019s decision to suspend the fund. \u201cThe alternative would have been much more disorderly,\u201d Bailey told Bloomberg TV in his first comments since the gates were closed on investors on Wednesday. He offered assurances that the FCA would be watching Woodford closely as the fund manager started to sell off his stakes in privately held companies, which are more difficult to turn into cash. Bailey said it was important for funds like Woodford\u2019s to invest in unlisted firms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
