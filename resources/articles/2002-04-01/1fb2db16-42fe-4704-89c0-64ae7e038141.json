He shakes my hand as if he's found it floating two weeks dead in a slough. I tell him I need money. Tons of it. I want to buy a new Lamborghini, load it with absinthe and opium, and hit the trail out of these rainy hills for a few years in Paris. I try to explain I'm at that point in my artistic development where I require a long period of opulent reflection. The banker rifles my wallet. Examines my mouth. Chuckles when I offer 20 Miltonic sonnets as security on the loan. Now he's shaking his head, my confidence, my hand good-bye. \"Wait,\" I plead, \"I have debts and dreams my present cash flow can't possibly sustain.\" \"Sorry,\" he mumbles, \"nothing I can do,\" and staples some papers in a way that makes me feel he'd rather nail my tongue to an ant hill. I stare at him in disbelief. And under the righteous scathing of my gaze the banker begins to change form. First, he becomes a plate of cold french fries drenched in crankcase oil. Then a black spot on a page of Genesis. Finally, a dung beetle, rolling little balls of shit across a desk bigger than my kitchen. Yet even as I follow these morbid transformations I never lose sight of his bloated face, the green, handled skin shining like rotten meat. But then his other faces open to mine: father, lover, young man, child - our shared human history folding us into one. And only that stops me from beating him senseless with a sock full of pennies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
