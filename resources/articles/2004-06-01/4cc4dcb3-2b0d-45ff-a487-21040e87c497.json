Research by the Guardian reveals that his probable starting XI have, on average, played up to 14 games more than their European championship rivals. Such statistics will augment the fears of those who harbour doubts about England's ability to stay the course in major competitions following poor second-half displays against Sweden and Brazil during the 2002 World Cup. Spain, where club sides play the same number of league games as their English counterparts, occupy second place in the fatigue table, although the difference between the respective nations is, on average, more than five games per player. At the opposite end of the scale are the Czech Republic, who benefit from the peripheral role that many of their players occupy at club level, with Vladimir Smicer at Liverpool a perfect example. The Italians are also relatively fresh, partly because of their club sides' poor performances in Europe but also due to the lack of significance attributed to their domestic cup. Indeed, should John Terry be fit for Sunday's match with France he will be one of six England players on show who played more than 50 games last season, a factor that could prove significant when fatigue begins to set in during the latter stages of the tournament. It is a scenario that Birmingham City's manager Steve Bruce believes places England in an inferior position to other competing nations. \"I think it has to be a disadvantage, the tournament has come at the end of a long hard season,\" said Bruce. \"I know people will say that it's the same for every other country but it's so competitive in the Premiership and that makes the matches so much quicker, compared with the other European leagues. \"But it will be interesting to see how the French players fare as well, because so many of them play in the Premiership.\" That may be true but, unfortunately for Eriksson, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger displayed a tendency to withdraw his Frenchmen from the field once the result was secure, none more so than Robert Pires. Conversely Claudio Ranieri, for all his tinkering at Stamford Bridge, permitted Frank Lampard and Terry few opportunities to rest in a season that began with Champions League qualifiers in August. Bruce believes, though, that Terry's exertions will be less of a concern for the England manager. \"I think with respect to John Terry it's much different when you're a central defender as opposed to a midfielder who covers an average of about 12 or 13 kilometres a game or a striker who has to be razor sharp,\" he said. By that measure Lampard and David Beckham have run a good few marathons this season, although the England captain will be fully aware that several of his Real Madrid colleagues, including Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, Raul and Luis Figo are, because of his club's small squad, in a similar position. Yet for Tottenham Hotspur's fitness coach, Kunle Odetoyinbo, the greatest danger facing England is not the worry of falling fitness levels but the increased risk of injuries that comes with playing through prolonged domestic campaigns. \"In the short term I think that physically we will be OK in the European Championship because the players will have been given enough of a rest before it starts,\" said Odetoyinbo. \"But, if I was working with the England squad I would more concerned with the injuries players will have been carrying during the season, and, because of this, mentally they're looking for a rest but at the same time they're also thinking I've got to get through this tournament.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
