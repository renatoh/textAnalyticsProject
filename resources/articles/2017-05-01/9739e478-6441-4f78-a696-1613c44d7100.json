The missile landed inside Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone in the Sea of Japan. Yoshihide Suga, a spokesman for the Japanese government, said it had strongly protested to Pyongyang about the launch. There were no reports of damage, he added. \u201cThis ballistic missile launch by North Korea is highly problematic from the perspective of the safety of shipping and air traffic, and is a clear violation of United Nations security council resolutions,\u201d Suga told reporters. \u201cJapan absolutely cannot tolerate North Korea\u2019s repeated provocative actions. We have strongly protested to North Korea and condemn its actions in the strongest terms.\u201d A statement from South Korea\u2019s joint chiefs of staff said the launch came from near the eastern port city of Wonsan. The military said it was a short-range Scud missile that flew about 450km (280 miles). South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency, without citing a source, said the projectile was believed to be a ballistic missile, but the South Korean military said it was still analysing it. The US president, Donald Trump, was briefed about the missile test, a White House official said. North Korea is thought to still be several years away from being able to target US mainland cities, but each test brings this goal closer. Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs are among the biggest foreign policy challenges for Trump and the new South Korean president, Moon Jae-in. Trump has alternated in his public statements between bellicosity and flattery, but his administration is working to solidify a policy to deal with North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Moon, who was elected earlier this month, has signalled that he will be flexible in expanding civilian exchange with North Korea. But many analysts say he is not likely to push for a major rapprochement because Pyongyang has gone too far on its nuclear programme. Besides regular ballistic missile test launches, North Korea carried out two nuclear tests in January and September 2016. Analysts believe the North may be able to arm some of its shorter-range missiles with nuclear warheads, though the exact state of its weapons programme is unknown. Moon has made tentative steps toward engaging with Pyongyang by restarting stalled civilian aid initiatives. South Korea recently said it would allow a civic group to contact North Korea about potentially offering help with treating malaria, the first government approval on cross-border civilian exchanges since January 2016.
