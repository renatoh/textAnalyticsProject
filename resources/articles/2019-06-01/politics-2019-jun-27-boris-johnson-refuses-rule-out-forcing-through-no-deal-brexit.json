The frontrunner to be the next prime minister confirmed it was one of the options on the table, after failing to give clear answers on several other occasions. Johnson said on Wednesday that the chance of a no-deal Brexit was \u201ca million to one against\u201d, but he has also promised to completely replace the \u201cdefunct\u201d withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May and leave the EU by 31 October. The EU has repeatedly said the deal is not up for renegotiation, leading the odds of leaving without a deal to rise. Speaking at a hustings for Conservative members in Bournemouth on Thursday, the former foreign secretary said he did not want to prorogue parliament to prevent MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit but it should not be removed as an option. Asked whether he would do it, he said: \u201cI would rather than confiding in this archaic device to get this thing done at my own behest, I would rather confide in the maturity of common sense of parliamentarians, all of whom are now staring down the barrel of public distrust.\u201d He was then pressed to categorically rule it out and failed to do so, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not attracted to the idea of a no-deal exit from the EU but, you know, I think it would be absolutely folly to rule it out. I think it\u2019s an essential tool of our negotiation. \u201cI don\u2019t envisage the circumstances in which it will be necessary to prorogue parliament, nor am I attracted to that expedient.\u201d Johnson got the loudest applause of the hustings by saying he would take a different approach to the negotiations than May had done. He claimed to be an \u201cirenic person\u201d and in favour of dialogue but argued that \u201ca little bit more resolve is called for and a little bit more sense that we can actually get this done\u201d. On domestic policy, he argued for students to be taken out of the immigration cap, reform of the student loan system to solve the social care crisis, and an extra \u00a35bn to the school system. He also criticised his rival, Jeremy Hunt, for pledging to cancel student debt for some entrepreneurs employing at least 10 people full time for five years. \u201cI think people, a lot of people, would automatically be defining themselves as entrepreneurs,\u201d Johnson said. Hunt opened his appearance at the hustings by saying the party should not pick a \u201cpopulist\u201d to fight Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn but \u201cchoose our own Jeremy\u201d to stick up for business, aspiration and social justice for young people. The foreign secretary also made a surprising pledge to resign as prime minister if he doesn\u2019t manage to \u201cdeliver Brexit and deliver it very quickly\u201d. Asked by moderator Hannah Vaughan Jones if he was \u201cconcerned by threats it could be the shortest tenure in history\u201d, he replied: \u201cWell, if we get this wrong, it will be. \u201cAnd we have got the biggest constitutional crisis in living memory and that is because MPs like me made a promise to the people that we would deliver the outcome of the referendum whatever it was and we failed.\u201d He was then asked if he would resign if he failed to deliver the referendum\u2019s result. \u201cOf course, no prime minister is going to last any time at all if they don\u2019t deliver Brexit and deliver it very quickly,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality of British politics \u2026 That\u2019s about anyone who does that job.\u201d As he sought to win over the highly Eurosceptic membership, he said he would introduce a \u201cno-deal bill\u201d in the first Queen\u2019s speech in the new parliamentary session. He also said he would introduce new legislation to ensure every child leaves school able to read and write and got booed by the audience for committing to the HS2 highspeed rail line. He was pressed about how he would fulfil his pledges without raising debt, after the Institute for Fiscal Studies said his tax and spending proposals amounting to more than \u00a360bn could exacerbate pressures on public finances. \u201cAll my commitments are funded through a pledge that I will keep reducing debt as a proportion of GDP over the economic cycle so we won\u2019t be building up debt for future generations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe actually have now about \u00a326bn of headroom a year, which is why we can afford some of these commitments.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
