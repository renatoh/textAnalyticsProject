It was his last completed piano work, and is as shadowy and mysterious as the title suggests. Schiff plays the hushed opening theme as if holding his breath. In addition to the published version of the Fantasy in C, Schiff offers the unexpected, alternative ending, long hidden in a library in Budapest. So there is much to explore here, as well as Schiff's formidably incisive, subtle and persuasive pianism to relish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
