Scenes of mayhem during the operation caused L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government considerable embarrassment in October as security forces briefly captured Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n only to let him go hours later as the security forces were overwhelmed by cartel forces. Probably tipped off ahead of the operation, hundreds of heavily armed gunmen from the Sinaloa cartel poured into Culiac\u00e1n, a city of a million people. An hours-long siege ensued, as the cartel gunmen erected flaming roadblocks and unloaded bursts of gunfire in the streets in a coordinated effort to free the younger Guzm\u00e1n. But the aborted arrest \u2013 and the chaos that it unleashed \u2013 prompted accusations that the government had simply folded in the face of cartel firepower, and cast further doubt on the president\u2019s efforts to overhaul Mexico\u2019s security strategy. L\u00f3pez Obrador had previously said his security cabinet made the call to release Ovidio, a decision he said he endorsed to protect terrorized residents from the crossfire between cartel henchmen and security forces. Friday was the first time the president openly acknowledged having given the order himself. \u201cSo as not to put the population at risk \u2026 I ordered that this operation be stopped and that this alleged criminal be released,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said at a news conference. L\u00f3pez Obrador added that a couple days later Donald Trump offered to help crack down on the cartel, but Mexico did not accept it. The US continues to seek Ovidio\u2019s extradition. Despite L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s promises to tame violence with policies focused on relieving rampant poverty and youth unemployment, homicides in Mexico have climbed to record levels during the first four months of this year. In 2019, the president\u2019s first full year in office, homicides hit an all-time high. Reuters contributed reporting"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
