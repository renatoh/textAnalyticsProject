Waitrose targets market towns", "bodyText": "There's fresh asparagus from John Poll, flour from Glebe farm, ale from a microbrewery in Cambridge, and the piece de resistance of the relaunched Waitrose in St Neots : spicy sauces from a couple who grow chillies three miles down the road. The first of what could eventually be up to 100 new \"market town\" branches of Waitrose, specialising in selling food from local producers, opened yesterday in the Cambridgeshire market town. Waitrose says its \"ambitious\" expansion through medium-sized town centre stores will support local farmers and small-scale food producers by selling more fresh and local food. Cynics fear independent shops may close. Local tomatoes and asparagus were snapped up by shoppers as a brass band played by the entrance, where a \"food map\" showed the provenance of local produce. Aisle-ends showcased local jam, salad dressings and juice. \"If it hasn't got a label saying this country on it, I drop it. That makes it difficult to shop,\" said customer Richard Haslop. He is pleased Waitrose is focusing on local food but would prefer to shop in small independent shops - if there were any left. \"I'd rather have local people selling stuff. Just because it's got a bit of mud on it you get it a few pence cheaper.\" The population of St Neots has risen to almost 30,000 and the town is earmarked for large growth, but residents say the number of shops keeps shrinking. There are opticians, estate agents, a lingerie shop and a tattoo parlour in the town centre but no butcher, baker, fishmonger or grocer can make a living, particularly since Waitrose, Marks &amp; Spencer, Somerfield and an edge-of-town Tesco moved in. \"I don't think Waitrose will damage local shops because there are very few independents left in St Neots to put out of business,\" said Margaret Tabone, who has lived here for 30 years. \"It's been a gradual process over the years as people retire from these independents and no one takes them on. Within a few hundred yards of our house there was a newsagent, greengrocer, butcher, baker and corner shop with post office, and only the post office is left.\" The Waitrose managing director, Mark Price, is adamant that launching new \"market town\" stores specialising in local produce will not close independent food businesses. \"There is no evidence that the opening of a Waitrose closes down good local butchers and greengrocers. All our evidence shows that when Waitrose comes into a town it creates a food culture in the town.\" Waitrose will open other small town centre supermarkets in Buckingham and Brackley in June and July, also trialling local foods. These are \"absolutely not\" Waitrose versions of Tesco Express, says Diana Hunter, the director of store development. \"This is a small supermarket with a big focus on fresh food. This isn't a convenience store - the customer can shop here and get everything for their weekly shop. You can't get that in Tesco Express.\" Half of the food in the new stores will be fresh food. Just 1% of the St Neots range hails from within 30 miles of the store, but a much larger proportion of its fresh food hails from the region, including beef from Suffolk, ice-cream from Northampton, and ros\u00e9 from Essex. Would customers pay more for local food in the credit crunch? \"If it was something special like honey I would. If it was expensive milk then no, but my husband likes expensive local ales so I should've got a larger trolley,\" said Sheila Lloyd. \"With the price of food going up that's more of a concern now than it would have been this time last year,\" said Karen Hunt. \"Providing you're getting good quality and there's not going to be any waste it's worth considering paying a little bit more.\" Price said market town shoppers told them they wanted greater emphasis on local food. Last year Waitrose recorded a 117% increase in sales of local food and sales are up this year. \"In the slowdown people are still buying quality food. Some people are trading down from eating out and buying great food to cook at home instead. Others are saying: 'We've got a special occasion, we'll go to Waitrose.'\" More unique than the deli-style produce in Waitrose is Barry Hamilton: his small greengrocer's nearby is the only one left in St Neots. He started out with his father 40 years ago and has survived by selling flowers, pet food and plants alongside the fruit and veg. \"You won't get this in Waitrose,\" he said, pointing to the asparagus. \"It was picked this morning.\" It cost \u00a31.95 a bunch. In Waitrose it costs \u00a32.49."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
