Are you going to Africa? What have you enjoyed most? Were you scared on the camel? We didn't know millipedes were red, did that frighten you? What was the concert like, did Sue have to tie the bow tie and where did the tuxedo come from? We think you are very brave. What does the rain forest feel like? Have you made lots of new friends on your journey? We hope you have a lovely time, look after Sue until you get home. Love from Class Six PS this is our first e mail!!!!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
