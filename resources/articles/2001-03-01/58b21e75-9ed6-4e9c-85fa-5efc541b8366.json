The appointment of Sir Nigel Wicks, 60, second permanent secretary at the Treasury, as chairman of the committee on standards in public life, marks a major departure. He is the first Whitehall mandarin to hold the job. His predecessors are both judges, Lord Neill of Bladen and the law lord, Lord Nolan. Sir Nigel, who started his career as a BP oil executive, has served in the private offices of two prime ministers, Lord Callaghan and Lady Thatcher, and was economic minister at the Washington embassy in the mid 1980s. He has been at the Treasury since 1989. He was chairman of the European community monetary committee between 1993 and 1998 and a member of the EU committee on European securities regulation. He got on equally well with the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and his Tory predecessor, Kenneth Clarke. Whitehall insiders were predicting that Sir Nigel's establishment credentials would be no barrier to him taking a firm line over integrity in government. They were confidently predicting he would be a gamekeeper turned poacher - with the added advantage of inside knowledge. \"He knows where the bodies are buried and has had first hand experience of crisis in government,\" a Whitehall source said. Andrew Tyrie, former Treasury special adviser to the former Tory chancellor Lord Lamont, and now MP for Chichester, said: \"He is a dedicated civil servant who loyally served his masters, whoever they were. This new job will be a challenge for him to set his own agenda.\" Sir Nigel takes over today from Lord Neill, the man who devised the first rules for party political funding and campaigning. His predecessor, Lord Nolan, framed the new parliamentary anti-sleaze regulations in the wake of the \"cash for questions\" scandal. The committee also announced the appointment of two women members, Rabbi Julia Neuberger, and Rita Donaghy. Rabbi Neuberger is chief executive of the King's Fund, an independent health care charity, and is a former trustee of the Runnymede Trust. Ms Donaghy is chairwoman of the arbitration service Acas. She is a former president of the TUC and former member of the low pay commission and the equal opportunities commission task group on equal pay. The committee, set up in 1994, will for the first time have an equal number of men and women on it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
