The electorate in Mount Vernon, at least by midday, seemed uniformly gray-haired. Outside, 84-year-old Earl Middleton climbed the steps to vote. \u201cThere\u2019s only one man to vote for,\u201d he said. \u201cI served my country, and I\u2019m voting for the one man who will keep our military strong.\u201d Who is that? \u201cDonald Trump!\u201d he said. Further south, on Mobile Bay, in the relatively affluent town of Fairhope, a woman in her 20s named Megrez Mosher voted. She felt stunned by the demographic \u2013 gray-haired, like rural Mount Vernon, and said she was \u201call about shaming people into doing their civic duty\u201d. So she went home and posted on Facebook: \u201cI just voted. I was the only person my age in the civic center. Millennials and Gen Xers get out and vote!! I don\u2019t really care who you vote for, but don\u2019t keep posting memes and sharing articles on Facebook if you do not fulfill your civic duty.\u201d Alaska \u2013 Republican caucuses Julia O\u2019Malley in Anchorage \u201cOh, it\u2019s gonna be big,\u201d said Peter Goldberg, 67, chairman of the Alaska Republican party. \u201cBy big I mean I think last time we did this four years ago, there were a little more than 15,000 [votes counted] \u2013 I\u2019m expecting 20,000. But at the rate that phone out there is ringing, it may exceed that \u2026 I think the primary factor is the incredible dissatisfaction with what Barack Obama has done to the country in the last seven years \u2026 Because I\u2019m chair of the party, my position (on which candidate to support) is neutral. Not even my wife knows.\u201d American Samoa \u2013 Democratic caucuses Ellen Brait in New York Two American Samoans spoke about what issues are important to them, and what they want candidates to know about their sometimes-overlooked home: Patrick Ti\u2019a Reid, 32: \u2018We don\u2019t have a big voice on the political stage\u2019 I\u2019m voting for Hillary Clinton. I feel like she\u2019s the only candidate that\u2019s actually been here. So the fact that she\u2019s actually visited the island tells me that she\u2019s more aware of the issues we\u2019re facing as a territory. I think she has a better plan, she\u2019s more experienced, she\u2019s more qualified, and I think she\u2019ll do a better job than any of the other candidates. We don\u2019t have a big voice on the political stage. Because we\u2019re so remote, people are more concerned with what\u2019s going on here on the island, I think, than with national issues. I also don\u2019t think candidates are very aware of how impacted we are by some foreign policies because we have so many family members in the military. Uperesa Fakava, 19: \u2018I would like to see up-close what they\u2019re really doing\u2019 I\u2019m kind of leaning towards Bernie Sanders for the Democratic party. I would like [the candidates] to know that the unemployment rate is so high here and most families live almost in poverty. Some families don\u2019t even have electricity. I\u2019m always watching the news everyday and I have subscriptions to online newspapers so I\u2019m always up to date on this kind of stuff but I would like to see up close what they\u2019re really doing. People in New Hampshire get to meet all the candidates, I would really like to meet one of them \u2013 but since I\u2019m here I only get to watch the news and subscribe to the newspapers and publishers. Arkansas \u2013 Democratic and Republican primaries Jeb Lund in Little Rock, Arkansas If you were in Little Rock, you woke up to something like this today, the neighborhood notwithstanding. Under normal circumstances, this sort of weather is not a problem; you live in the south, so it happens pretty much from summer into fall with great regularity. What it might\u2019ve done, however, is stifle your urge for manning the polls or standing on street corners waving signs. Not that it likely mattered. Early voting begin two weeks ago, and Arkansas has experienced near record levels of early voters. Campaign workers I spoke to said that chances for converting voters had in many cases been thwarted by early voting. Everyone from friends to former governor Jim Guy Tucker reported seeing full precincts on opening day, with steady flows of voters, a tableau that has been repeated at lunch hour for every day since. Basically, between early voting, the lack of competitive Democratic state-wide races and a 25-point lead for Hillary Clinton here, this was probably over before the rain started. If one group is liable to be harmed by inclement weather, it\u2019s likely to be late-breaking voters and converts for Donald Trump, the sort of people who might not have been active enough to get out and cast a ballot early. While Ted Cruz holds a slight lead over Trump and Rubio, either of the latter two candidates can erase that if their voters are motivated. Rubio recently received an endorsement from Republican governor Asa Hutchinson, and Trump recently hired Mike Huckabee\u2019s daughter to run his outreach here in the state. Also, the sun just came out. Time to find out whose ass it\u2019s going to shine on. Colorado \u2013 Democratic and Republican caucuses Sam Levin in Denver, Colorado Bernie Sanders volunteer Alex Calleros stumbled on an unusual household while doing a final round of canvassing before the Super Tuesday Democratic caucus in Denver. Maile Rains, who answered the door, was the registered Democrat the Sanders campaign was trying to reach. But her husband, she explained, would not be caucusing for Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, because he is a registered Republican. \u201cWe\u2019re very respectful and open-minded,\u201d said Rains, a 36-year-old stay-at-home mother. \u201cWe have the same values but different approaches.\u201d Rains said she did not know if she was going to support Clinton or Sanders on Super Tuesday \u2013 she had reservations about both of them. Her husband, meanwhile, was interested in Marco Rubio and John Kasich, although Colorado\u2019s unique GOP caucus won\u2019t be an official vote and delegates will remain free agents (meaning the Super Tuesday event doesn\u2019t matter too much on the Republican side). \u201cThe unifying issue for us is Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do we oust him? \u2026 We\u2019re scared of him ... It\u2019s like Mussolini all over again.\u201d Georgia \u2013 Democratic and Republican primaries Richard Wolffe in Atlanta, Georgia Is Donald Trump a dream candidate for Democrats? Judging from all the whoopin\u2019 and a hollerin\u2019 at a Rubio rally inside an Atlanta hotel on Monday, he might just be the kind of Republican nominee who finally delivers some bipartisan agreement in American politics \u2013 agreement that Trump represents a surefire disaster for the Republican party. In a ballroom filled with several hundred Republicans, Nikki Haley denounced Trump for failing to disavow support from the Ku Klux Klan. Along the way, the South Carolina governor \u2013 a rising star inside the party \u2013 described Trump in terms that were much harsher than anything she used to condemn either Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. After calling him a Kindergarten bully, she linked him to a wrenching moment in her own state\u2019s recent history. \u201cSouth Carolina went through a terrible tragedy last year,\u201d she said, referring to the Charleston church massacre, in which Dylann Roof killed nine black churchgoers as he tried to ignite racial conflict. \u201cAnd the KKK came to South Carolina from out of state to protest on our statehouse grounds. We saw and looked at true hate in the eyes, last year in Charleston. \u201cI will not stop until we fight a man that chooses not to disavow the KKK. That is not a part of our party. That is not who we want as president. We will not allow that in our country.\u201d Massachusetts \u2013 Democratic and Republican primaries Jill Abramson in Charlestown, Massachusetts The turnout was heavy in Ward 3, Precinct 2 in Charlestown, Massachusetts, near downtown Boston, with lots of older women in line to vote. In order to receive their paper ballots, voters had to declare their party. The Democratic line seemed to be far more active than the Republican one. Hillary Clinton was listed third on the ballot, behind Sanders and O\u2019Malley. Trump was near the top of the much longer GOP ballot. Both ballots listed all the candidates who had since dropped out. One woman, a 32-year-old Democrat, said she was excited to cast her ballot for a woman. She said, \u201cHillary will fight for the things I care about, like quality and affordable child care.\u201d Minnesota \u2013 Democratic and Republican caucuses Megan Carpentier in Minneapolis Colin, 25, works at an upscale coffee house just north of downtown Minneapolis, at the base of a new construction apartment building with rentals he can\u2019t afford. But as well as spending his days as a full-time barista, serving $5 pour-overs to well-off Minnesotans who drink them in front of their laptops, he also serves upscale grilled cheese sandwiches out of a food truck and hosts a bar trivia night to make ends meet. \u201cI know I\u2019m a walking stereotype\u201d he said. \u201cOf course I support who I support\u201d \u2013 which is Bernie Sanders. Colin, who is looking for a full-time job at a non-profit serving college-age young people, says that he supports Sanders \u201con principles\u201d like health care, job security assistance and Sanders\u2019 college tuition plans (\u201cI\u2019m out of school, but I work three non-college-mandatory jobs.\u201d) He caucused for Barack Obama in 2008, when he was 18, but he\u2019s not optimistic about tonight\u2019s caucus results. \u201cI\u2019ve got this vibe right now where I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to win the nomination, which sucks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I still want my voice to be heard.\u201d And when it comes to the general, he isn\u2019t going to stay home even if Sanders isn\u2019t on the ballot. \u201cI\u2019m still going to vote Democratic,\u201d he vowed. Oklahoma \u2013 Democratic and Republican primaries Leah Sikes in Edmond, Oklahoma In election seasons, it\u2019s easy to find yourself stuck in a labeled box against your will. As a student at Oklahoma Christian University, pollsters and political pundits assume things about people like me because of my background. But I\u2019m not a stereotypical conservative from Oklahoma. I am a Christian \u2013 but I am also a feminist. Living in the heart of the Bible belt, it isn\u2019t surprising that people\u2019s views tend to lean to the right, especially on a Christian college campus. Many of my classmates have thrown their support behind candidates like Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio. I have different political leanings \u2013 I am more drawn to libertarians than traditional conservatives because I believe in the right to freedom, be it religious or otherwise. Just as I wouldn\u2019t want to live according to other people\u2019s religious laws, no one should be bound to my Christian beliefs. But I\u2019m not the only one who is the odd one out on campus: there is not a lack of students backing Bernie Sanders. Tennessee \u2013 Democratic and Republican primaries Adam Gabbatt in Nashville With Tennessee being among the Super Tuesday states voting today, the Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt headed to Nashville to find out how catchy some of this year\u2019s most famous campaign lines would sound if they made it into a song. He met up with local bands Sweet Cheeks and the Strumms and challenged them to a freestyle music contest. Texas \u2013 Democratic and Republican primaries Ben Jacobs in Houston Speaking outside his polling place in Houston, Ted Cruz suggested that Marco Rubio should consider dropping out after Super Tuesday. The Texas senator told reporters: \u201cI believe we are going to do very, very well here in Texas. It\u2019s gonna be up to Texans to make their decision. But there is no doubt that any candidate who cannot win his home state has real problems.\u201d He added: \u201cany candidate that wakes up tomorrow morning that has not won any states, for any candidate that wakes up tomorrow morning and has won a negligible number of delegates, it\u2019s time to start thinking about coming together and unifying and a clear choice.\u201d The statements represented a clear shot at Rubio, who has yet to win a state and is lagging in polls in his home state of Florida. However, despite this, Rubio has become an establishment favorite and party elected officials are coalescing around his candidacy, much to the irritation of the Cruz campaign. While Cruz is favored in his home state of Texas and has the potential to win other states on Super Tuesday, Rubio\u2019s campaign has already conceded that the Florida senator will be shut out yet again in Tuesday\u2019s contests. Spokespeople for Rubio\u2019s campaign did not immediately return a request for comment. After engaging for months in a bitter battle with Cruz, the Florida senator has recently shifted his focus to attacking Donald Trump as part of a last-ditch effort to blunt the frontrunner\u2019s momentum. Vermont \u2013 Democratic and Republican presidential primaries Sophie Yanow in Hartford, Vermont Illustrator Sophie Yanow drove to Hartford, Vermont to meet voters and sketch them \u2013 they told her who they voted for, and why. Virginia \u2013 Democratic and Republican primaries Lucia Graves in Lynchburg, Virginia The struggle for the anti-establishment vote in Virginia is very much a mirror image of what\u2019s happening at the national level as Donald Trump and Ted Cruz vie for Republican voters ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary Cruz has invested significant energy in the state, launching his bid for the presidency at the evangelical stronghold Liberty University back in March of 2015. But almost exactly a year after he first came to town, it is Trump who\u2019s been making inroads in the state, attracting a wide array of unlikely voting groups such as evangelical voters and military veterans. Military veteran Jon Whitman, 38, is an outspoken Trump supporter and at a rally on the campus of Radford University on Monday, he praised the mogul as really \u201csmart\u201d and a better candidate than the media gives him credit for. Trump\u2019s record on the military was criticized after he made derogatory comments about John McCain\u2019s torture despite never having served in the military himself. But such things don\u2019t bother Whitman. \u201cI honestly think there\u2019s a lot of media hype about Trump and basically I don\u2019t go off of a lot of media hype,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here today.\u201d Similarly, the Guardian\u2019s conversations with Republican voters in Southeastern Virginia have found supporters are indifferent to many of Trump\u2019s other stumbles, such as his hesitancy to denounce his support from white supremacist David Duke, something Virginia resident Josh Neuse, 31, denounced as an \u201cirrelevant issue\u201d. The candidate\u2019s promise to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is a concept that plays well in poor rural parts of Virginia, where for many years, coal was king. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring the coal energy back 100%,\u201d Trump said in his speech yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s devastated for no reason whatsoever so we\u2019re going to bring coal back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
