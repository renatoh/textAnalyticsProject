It\u2019s mid-June and you should be outside being wholesome: fishing with your dad, running through fields of wheat or looking interested as some posh bloke tries to sell you some overpriced olives at your nearest farmer\u2019s market. But nope, you\u2019re here, glued to a screen, eking out yet another toilet break at work to catch up on the Women\u2019s World Cup and read your favourite tea-timely email. Will football ever end? Not if it has anything to do with Sky Sports News, which went into overdrive on Thursday morning with a breaking story \u2013 encouragingly not from one of their \u2018sources\u2019 \u2013 that really hit the sweet spot: the Premier League fixture list! Another year of your broadcasting overlords shoving expensive content that they own up your nose! Hoorah! Distressed, excited and hopeful, fans from each Premier League club were beamed in, one by one, to talk about their club\u2019s chances in 2019-20. Because it is in the future, and as most were teenage YouTubers and apparent social media parodies sitting in their bedrooms, none of them actually knew, although one went to great lengths explaining what Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s plan would be, most of which revolved around not getting tonked by Chelsea and Wolves in their first two fixtures. Much like Love Island or Gogglebox or the House of Commons, there was a brilliant low-brow dissection of British culture on show. While talking about his side\u2019s opening-day trip to Bournemouth, Sheffield United\u2019s finest wore a flat cap and a T-shirt that said: \u2018Every three weeks I need my hair cuttin.\u2019 No, really. Norwich\u2019s supporter was too busy making faces at the Villa fan\u2019s suggestion that Jack Grealish was the best player in the Championship to actually contribute anything of note. If that didn\u2019t get your blood pumping, just wait until you hear about the new 7.45pm kick-off times on a Saturday night. That one should go down a treat with the hard-won audiences in Asia. Or what about the news that you\u2019ll have to get another subscription if you want to watch all the televised games? Don\u2019t mind if we do! It wasn\u2019t even the most dismal league update of the day, what with the news that France\u2019s top flight will be renamed \u2018Ligue Urrrrrrrn Uber Eats\u2019 in 2020-21, with the match ball for each game brought on the pitch by a delivery man. It. Never. Ends. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Kieran Pender from 5pm BST for flamin\u2019 MBM coverage of Australia 1-3 Brazil, while Niall McVeigh will be on hand at 8pm for South Africa 0-1 China. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe had a turnout of about 40-50 people. There were good vibes\u201d \u2013 manager Danny Rodriguez is left to clutch at the positives after his American Social bar in Miami offered \u201cfree shots for every [USA! USA!! USA!!!] goal\u201d during their Women\u2019s World Cup game over Thailand. That 13-0 win. We\u2019re not expecting quotes from the patrons for another few days. RECOMMENDED LISTENING It\u2019s Football. Weekly. Extraaaaaaa! FIVER LETTERS \u201cI would like to invite you be the guest team at our small but perfectly formed football tournament. It is here in Oxford on Sunday 23 June. All proceeds to a local hospice. And a BBQ with Polish sausages, you won\u2019t get that at the Copa Am\u00e9rica\u201d \u2013 Peter Hart [will check in with our cousins \u2013 Fiver Ed]. \u201cI noticed that Fiverr International Ltd has completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. I thought that maybe this share offering was related to a certain tea-timely email. However, some cursory research shows that this Fiverr launched on time, was well-received by the public (up 45% as of now) and, despite describing themselves as a marketplace for online services, is not a place to buy Tin or other adult beverages\u201d \u2013 R Reisman. \u201cHats off to The Fiver for maintaining its usual levels of journalistic rigour by failing to give a single mention to Norn Iron\u2019s six-point haul from two tricky away games in tough conditions in June, with a number of the squad barely having seen a football pitch since April, thereby further cementing (if it were needed) the managerial acumen of Michael O\u2019Neill. Not even a mention in what we were told were talking points from the last week of men\u2019s internationals. Keep up the \u2018work\u2019\u201d \u2013 James Irwin. \u201cIf James Maltby was perturbed by the results when he Googled \u2018Cantona D!cks Challenge\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters), imagine my surprise on trying to research the campaign by Fulham fans in 1991 against their manager Alan D1cks. You should see what \u2018Cottagers D!cks out\u2019 turns up\u201d \u2013 Michael Hann. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 James Irwin. BITS AND BOBS Oystons out! Simon Sadler has completed his takeover of Blackpool. Forest Green chairman Dale Vince is feeling funky after Stroud District Council gave short shrift to planning permission for a 5,000-seater wooden stadium. \u201cIt is a poor show,\u201d he sighed. \u201cMaybe we will appeal but that is another year of my life. How hard should I have to try to bring some progress? I do wonder if it is worth the effort.\u201d The damage done to English football\u2019s nicotine-to-club manager ratio by Maurizio Sarri\u2019s potential exit to Juventus has been offset by Slaven Bilic\u2019s arrival at West Brom on a two-year deal. \u201cI didn\u2019t think twice once they had spoken to me,\u201d he puffed. France centre-back Wendie Renard says her comedy own goal in their 2-1 Women\u2019s World Cup win over Norway proves the team needs to keep focus. \u201cIt shows that you need to keep your feet on the ground,\u201d she tooted when, as it turns out, doing the opposite might have spared her blushes. Standard Li\u00e8ge winger Moussa Djenepo is now \u00a314m Southampton winger Moussa Djenepo. \u201cIt is a dream come true,\u201d he roared. Bolton\u2019s administrators say they have had a suitable offer for the club but are keeping quiet about who it is from. \u201cThe preferred bidder has both the financial ability and the determination to turn around the club,\u201d administrated an administrator. And Denis Su\u00e1rez has echoed the thoughts of most Arsenal fans by describing his season at the club as \u201cone to forget\u201d, blaming pelvis-knack for his disappointing spell. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was even at 50%,\u201d he yelped. STILL WANT MORE? Why did Argentina celebrate their 0-0 World Cup draw with Japan so joyfully?Joshua Nadel and Brenda Elsey reveal the team\u2019s long battle against sexism. \u201cWe had a bath in pink champagne!\u201d How Denmark won the 1971 Women\u2019s World Cup, by Paul Doyle. Meanwhile, here\u2019s Hope Solo on USA! USA!! USA!!!\u2019s celebrations against Thailand. How Max Rushden forced an old man to leave a comfy chair, whisky and some peace and quiet for an awful night of disappointment, late-night trains and drunken fans. Argentina and the Copa Am\u00e9rica: not gonna happen, predicts floating brain in a jar Jonathan Wilson. Thirteen goals + one outrageous own goal = Classic YouTube.
