Now he has followed Howley into the Wales side, he prepares for big matches \u2013 and they have not come more momentous for the 27-year-old than Saturday\u2019s encounter with Ireland at the Millennium Stadium \u2013 by transporting himself back to the days when he played junior rugby. \u201cI do not get nervous before a match,\u201d says Webb, who last autumn ousted Mike Phillips, who had been a mainstay in the seven-year reign of the coach Warren Gatland. \u201cI try to think it is just another game for my local club. It relaxes me and makes me play with a smile on my face. Every game at international level is big, but you have to enjoy them.\u201d Despite Gatland\u2019s considerable success with Wales, the Lions and at club level, his teams have been accused of playing Warrenball, a pejorative term for a style of play perceived to be little more involved than big men bashing their way through the middle of the field: the former Ireland second row Neil Francis said Gatland shared the same number of brain cells as a tub of margarine but the theory ignores the change at scrum-half this season. If Phillips could be said to personify Warrenball, big, aggressive and confrontational, Webb is an opportunist who lives off his wits. He has scored two of Wales\u2019 four tries in this year\u2019s Six Nations, having touched down against Australia and New Zealand in the autumn, and created the one his half-back partner scored to win the game in Paris in the last round, darting through a gap at a ruck and linking with the flanker Dan Lydiate. \u201cIf I see a gap, my instinct is to go but you have to pick your moment,\u201d Webb says. \u201cYou cannot do it all the time: it is about being smart. When I went to that ruck in France, I was scanning and saw they had a big second row defending 10 metres either side of it and I knew if I went for it, there would be a gap for me. It is about getting over the gainline, putting the team on the front foot and creating space out wide for our dangerous backs.\u201d When Webb was growing up in Bridgend, he watched closely the leading scrum-halves in the world: Joost van der Westhuizen, Justin Marshall and Howley. He was at Ospreys when the New Zealander Marshall joined the region, learning the art of running a game and quickly adapting to changing circumstances. \u201cI picked up a lot from Marshall,\u201d he says. \u201cI also learned a lot from Kahn Fotuali\u2019i [the Samoa scrum-half now at Northampton] when he was at Ospreys. His running game was very good and I used to pick his brains. It is paying off. \u201cAs I have grown up, it is all about myself, doing things well. I do not really worry about any other scrum-halves, honing my skills such as passing and kicking and keeping my focus at all times. As long as I do my job the best I can, the rest will take care of itself.\u201d As Ireland\u2019s half-backs, Jonathan Sexton and Conor Murray, come as a pair, so Webb and his partner at Ospreys, Dan Biggar, are very much a duo; two vocal, forthright players who drive their team tactically. They lack the experience of their opposite numbers on Saturday, but they are equally as instrumental to their team. Positions which a year ago looked to be Wales\u2019 weakest are now among the strongest. \u201cRhys is an individual running threat,\u201d says Howley, who has been Wales\u2019 attack coach since 2007. \u201cHe brings forwards into play between nine and 10 and has an eye for a break, capable of scoring from five metres out or 20. He has benefited from his partnership with Dan and it is one that gives you a huge amount of confidence and self-belief. Rhys\u2019s composure is good, as is his kicking, which is a huge part of a scrum-half\u2019s game as Conor, one of the northern hemisphere\u2019s best nines, has shown. It will be interesting to see Rhys against him.\u2019 Webb and Biggar are friends as well as playing partners. \u201cWe are very good mates off the field, always in touch away from rugby,\u201d Webb says. \u201cWe room together when with Wales, although he normally stays up later than me, and it is nice to have someone outside you who you know inside out. The half-backs touch the ball more than other players and it is about creating special moments. Saturday will be a massive game for both teams. There will be no margin for error.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
