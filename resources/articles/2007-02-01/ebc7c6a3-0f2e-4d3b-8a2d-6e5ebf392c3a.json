In other words, rarely has life been so wonderful for so long - cheap money and low inflation have worked in glorious combination - yet rarely has it seemed so possible that the show could come to a sudden and very painful halt. Yesterday's little market wobble looks like one of those moments when the second thought was uppermost. Certainly, none of the other explanations looked adequate. The Chinese stock market, the supposed source, is a sideshow in global terms. A plunge of 9% in Shanghai, when it follows a 130% gain last year, is neither here nor there. As for Alan Greenspan's thoughts on the chances of US recession this year, well, he has said these things before now. And don't blame tensions in Iran: the price of oil and gold would have moved if that was the real worry. Frankly, if you are in the mood to worry, you can find any number of \"top of the market\" signals. Private equity seems to be determined to smash its own records for biggest-ever deals virtually every month. Old hands in the property market have been warning for months that asset prices have got out of hand. In the currency markets, the entire hedge fund industry, plus every Japanese saver, seems to be betting that the yen will remain weak. All are interesting developments, yet the most important medium-term guide to the direction of markets is probably still the willingness of American consumers to keep spending. At the moment, there is severe pain in the \"sub prime\" market, as HSBC knows too well. It does not appear to have spread yet, but the banks themselves are clearly terrified that it will. Lending standards are being tightened aggressively. Their actions are nowhere near panic levels, but a credit crunch is exactly what the bears have been predicting for the final chapter of the bull market. It does not feel like we're there yet, but the sense of peril is not subsiding. French toast Er, yes, we have stopped taking bets in France. This reluctant admission from PartyGaming yesterday was not made via the stock market, presumably because France contributes less than 5% of the company's business, which is usually taken as the official threshold of significance. Even so, territories such as France carry great hopes for Party and its ilk after the US was ruled off-limits last year. Rival 888.com saw sufficient potential in France to plaster its name over the football shirts of Toulouse, which may be one reason why the French authorities would like to speak to the company's former chief executive, John Anderson. Party's cessation of bets from France coincided with news of the same French inquiry into the industry, which is another reason why this story ought to interest investors. It seems the French request to interview a few leading online gambling executives has created utter panic among the operators. Most seem to have stopped taking bets from France overnight. Any other European government with a mind to curb online gambling has now been given a lesson in how it can be done. Primary legislation, which was the US route last year, is not necessary: huffing and puffing, plus a letter or two, can do the trick. It does not matter in Britain, where we are more tolerant of the industry, despite its disinclination to pay tax on its profits. But Germany and Scandinavia tend to be hostile. If they were to follow the French, Party certainly would have to explain what on earth is going on. Nutmegged At least Mike Ashley got in before the stock market wobble. The owner of Sports Direct got rid of 310m shares at 300p apiece, that's \u00a3929m in cash. Buyers will wish they hadn't bothered. The shares were going for 281p by the close yesterday. That was not what was meant by the appeal of discount retailing. Still, excitement, surprises and entertainment are almost guaranteed with this stock. That's not because entrepreneurial retailers tend either to fly or fall on the stock market, though that's true enough (DFS, Matalan and New Look come to mind). Rather, it's because Ashley has achieved the remarkable feat of submitting to the scrutiny of flotation while saying next to nothing about what makes him and his company tick. His reputation as the mystery man of retailing is intact. Nobody is any the wiser about why he bothered to float. We'll have to wait for the answer. nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
