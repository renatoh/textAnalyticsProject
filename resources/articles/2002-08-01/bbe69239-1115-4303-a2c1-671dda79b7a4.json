But only in moments in the first half did either side match the pace they showed when they came zipping and clapping themselves out of the tunnel before kick-off. Perhaps they should have kept the music on. \"Let's do it!\" went up the shout from the crowd - this was, after all Palace's first home fixture of the season - but for the first 20 minutes it had the look of a game with far too many natural pauses and fruitless suggestion. Dougie Freedman - one man who did look as though he had rhythm - claimed the clearest chance of the half, speeding on to Danny Granville's long arcing ball from left-back and enticing Gary Walsh to come half-stepping out of the box, pawing at the ball like a giant bear not entirely sure he had the appetite. The Palace forward skipped past and shaped up for the shot but then had to watch it skim off the head of Bradford's Peter Atherton. That shot seemed to turn the music back on: Freedman's skipping surges repeatedly left the Bradford defence falling over its feet.Twice in five minutes Shaun Derry darted into the box, only to find his headers finish in the arms of Walsh. Earlier in the day Nicky Law had alluded to the fact that few expected much of his Bradford side this season; that only added to the incentive, he said, \"to stick it up them, if you want\". But after the emotional high of a 0-0 draw at Wolves on Sunday - only 48 hours after the club learned that it had retained its league status - for three-quarters of this match a comedown seemed inevitable. Then Granville let Bradford's Gus Uhlenbeek skirt round him to find Andy Tod ready to scoop his cross into the net. That looked like serving a great injustice to Palace. But within three minutes Tony Popovic was flying through the air at the other end to head home Danny Butterfield's cross. For Trevor Francis it was just a pity he had to watch it from further away; he had already been asked to retire to the stands for abusing a linesman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
