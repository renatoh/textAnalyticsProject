The Committee of Advertising Practice \u2013 the code-setting body for all advertising in the UK that appears in any media except on TV and radio \u2013 is looking at the introduction of tighter rules on how food and drinks high in fat, salt and sugar are marketed to children. \u201cCAP\u2019s decision to carry out a public consultation responds, in part, to changes in children\u2019s media habits and evolving advertising techniques,\u201d said a spokesman for the CAP. \u201cCAP will ask a broad range of stakeholders whether a change of approach is now needed: an approach that would introduce for the first time in the non-broadcast code, rules dedicated to the targeting of advertising, to children, of food and soft drinks high in fat, salt or sugar.\u201d The Advertising Standards Authority, which administers the CAP code, said internet advertising overtook TV advertising as the most-complained about media in the UK for the first time last year. Last year, there were 13,477 complaints about 10,202 digital ads in the UK. Under existing CAP rules, food and soft drink ads must not condone poor nutritional habits or an unhealthy lifestyle in children. In addition, The use of celebrities and licensed characters are banned from junk food ads targeting younger children, and ads are not allowed to encourage \u201cpester power\u201d. While the wording of the CAP\u2019s consultation is nuanced, looking at \u201crules dedicated to the targeting of advertising to children\u201d means the body will actively be considering restrictions and even evaluating a ban. \u201c[The consultation] reflects a growing consensus, shared by public health and industry bodies, about the role of advertising self-regulation in helping to bring about a change in the nature and balance of food advertising targeted at children,\u201d said the CAP. The public consultation will launch in early 2016. In 2006, broadcasting regulator Ofcom tightened up rules on junk food advertising around all children\u2019s programming, on all children\u2019s channels and around all programmes that have a \u201cparticular appeal\u201d to under 16-year-olds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
