With leather skullcaps and Pierrot collars, chequerboard graphics and an onslaught of primary colours, balloon-legged trousers and shark-fin lapels, it was not easy on the eye. If you think his clothes are ugly, Ghesqui\u00e8re is absolutely fine with that. \u201cIt\u2019s the beauty of controversy,\u201d he explained after the show, beaming from ear to ear. \u201cI am happy to be misunderstood.\u201d After all, anyone can give the people what they want. Only a visionary can deliver what they don\u2019t yet understand, but will come to love. That was the concept behind this collection, expressed not only in the clothes but in the venue. Each season, Louis Vuitton builds a catwalk venue within one of the internal courtyards of the Louvre museum for its show. This time, Ghesqui\u00e8re recreated a section of the Pompidou Centre. The Teletubby colours and plasticine shapes of the iconic modern art museum were reproduced at a twentieth of the scale, with a metal catwalk that snaked around the walls, giving them the same inside-out look of the Pompidou, with its external escalators. The aesthetic of the Pompidou \u201cwas very much criticised at the time\u201d, said Ghesqui\u00e8re. \u201cBut it has become central to Paris, to culture, to young people, to everyone who loves the future. Your eye gets used to something, and your tastes evolved and change.\u201d While the setting was a direct homage to the jolie laide \u2013 unconventionally beautiful \u2013 Pompidou, the clothes were more connected with the people Ghesqui\u00e8re has observed from the piazza in front. \u201cI like to sit and watch the people there, to see what Paris really is. To see the streetdancers, the museum people who are quite eccentric sometimes, the fashion people, the gothics \u2013 everyone.\u201d There were grungy slip dresses, bulky padded motorcycle leathers, rakish jumbles of denim and tartan, florals and leopard print. Makeup gave the models deeply sculpted cheekbones and dark lips, as if to emphasise the strangeness of their angular faces, rather than the beauty. Most wore chunky, creeper-soled shoes. \u201cIn the past in fashion, we put women in high heels to empower them. Now we usually put them in flat shoes. I still love heels, but I don\u2019t feel any more that they add anything to a silhouette,\u201d said Ghesqui\u00e8re."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
