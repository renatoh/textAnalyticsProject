At the time I knew little about the state, but that it enjoyed a reputation for good government. Forcing people to vote in a pandemic \u2013 choosing between their health and losing their franchise \u2013 would have been unthinkable back then. But images of long voting lines in Wisconsin this week \u2013particularly in Democratic-leaning cities \u2013 illustrated a profound failure in governance in Wisconsin, one that is best understood as simply the latest chapter in a decade-long Republican project to maintain political power at all costs. In 2010, a Tea Party wave election transformed Wisconsin politics. This enabled the Republican Scott Walker to win the governorship and Republicans to establish control of the legislature that they would cement through gerrymandering, a careful manipulation of district maps that allows politicians to pack favorable voters in their constituencies. What followed was a decade of voter ID laws, reduced early voting periods and efforts to purge voters from the rolls, all with the purpose of maintaining Republican control. When Republicans eventually lost statewide offices in 2018, they convened a special session to strip those positions of basic powers. A conservative state supreme court greenlit these actions. By the time I departed Wisconsin that year, the ruthless prioritization of partisan control had become deeply embedded in conservative political culture. That makes this week\u2019s flawed election all too predictable. \u201cYou are incredibly safe to go out,\u201d insisted the assembly speaker, Robin Vos, completely bedecked in personal protective equipment. Wisconsin supreme court judges agreed, blocking Governor Tony Evers\u2019 bid to delay the election. And so, contrary to common sense and the advice of public health experts, the election proceeded. Why? The answer was simple. The key election on the ballot was for a seat on the state supreme court. Republicans calculated that polling stations in the mostly Republican rural and suburban areas would be quiet and open, and that polling places in more Democratic cities would be crowded or closed. Further, absentee ballot requests were rumored to skew whiter and richer. Such a scenario helped their candidate, and would hurt the more liberal candidate. It worked. The largest city, Milwaukee, is also a pandemic hotspot. Unable to find poll workers, just five of Milwaukee\u2019s usual 180 polling places were open to serve a population of about 595,000. Those who braved it faced lines that wrapped around city blocks. Many in line were among the thousands who had requested absentee ballots that never arrived. A federal court attempted to give voters some breathing space by allowing them extra time to return ballots, and suspending a requirement to have a witness signature, infeasible at a time of social distancing. But the conservative majority of the US supreme court overruled the lower court, forcing those who hadn\u2019t received their ballot to stand in line, and ruling any ballots returned without a witness signature to be null and void. Delaying the election would have also allowed timely delivery of mail ballots and moved in-person voting to a point when the coronavirus had subsided. We cannot pretend that those who risked their health in hours-long lines and those who completed their ballots safely in their home have an equal opportunity to participate in democracy. Evers acted late, but was the only public official to recognize the seriousness of the pandemic. Elections are ultimately the responsibility of the Republican-led legislature, who rebuffed Evers when he called for an all-mail election on 27 March and gaveled in and out without taking any action when Evers called a special session of the legislature on 3 April. It would be a mistake to categorize what happened this week as an isolated event, a forgivable lapse of judgment. Wisconsin has become a place where forcing crowded in-person voting during a pandemic is just the latest price for others to pay for a party with a win-at-all-costs mentality. This mentality, so dangerous for democracy, is not limited to Wisconsin, but is driven by Republicans across the country changing the rules of the game to hold on to power. Now, Wisconsin may be the canary in the coronavirus coalmine for the November elections. Republicans are already opposing efforts to extend all-mail voting \u2013 which has proven largely effective. Some use Orwellian doublespeak \u2013 the Republican party chair characterized it as \u201cthe way to undermine democracy\u201d \u2013 but Trump is characteristically blunter: \u201cIf you ever agreed to it you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d The emerging Republican position, crystallized in Wisconsin, is that democracy is a fine thing until you are in danger of losing power.
