They are from a musical family, which explains the ease with which they handle their haunting melodies and guileful arrangements. The way they can leap between grunge-like powerchords, wispy acoustic atmospherics and glorious outbursts of megapop would surely endear them to Beach Boys mastermind Brian Wilson. Almost every phase of pop history makes an appearance here, from the Sgt Pepper-isms of Something's Got to Give to the New Wavey blast of There's a Silence and the drifting hippiedom of Sleep Alone. File under brilliant debuts. (AS) Various Arabica (Bar De Lune) *** \u00a314.99 The French have a penchant for grooving on world music in fashionable bars. It's easy to understand why, after hearing this 15-track compilation of funky, atmospheric fusions between rootsy Arabic pop and western dance. This is perfect pre-club, pre-date music, blending the sexed-up and the grooved-up with fluid subtlety. Star names from north Africa's rai movement include Khaled, Cheb Mami and Rachid Taha, while Transglobal Underground represent the British end. Top marks go to Alfa X, whose First Transmission seduces with a singing violin riff that makes for perfect sultry, enigmatic pop, the delicious vocal yearnings of Zohar's Ehad, and the bassy, sinister Shashkin by Omar Tekbilek. Throughout the album, the beats reinterpret the mellow, jazzy end of hip-hop with cutting-edge nous, plus insidious string, pipe and horn riffs. Hugely enjoyable. (GM) The Notwist Neon Golden (City Slang) *** \u00a313.99 Often beguiling, often frustrating, Bavarian quartet the Notwist have mined a seam of quiet pop with a runaway sense of musical experimentation for five albums. Their sixth is their most refined yet. With Markus Archer's voice distractedly floating across the languid single Thrashing Days and the more up-tempo This Room, the Notwist initially sound as two-dimensional as Stereolab and as studious as High Llamas. Yet beneath the ethereality lurks a more sturdy heart. One with the Freaks begins with Archer muttering against a scratching percussive backdrop; New Order-esque guitar and drums raise the pace before a final twist involving whistles, distorted dub bass and a burst of scratching. Elsewhere, it's in the little things - the dirt-blues plucking on the title track, the woodwind flourish on One Step Inside Doesn't Mean You Understand - where the Notwist excel. But the bigger picture is more flawed: these 10 tracks are mostly fragmented and underdeveloped. (JA) Alexander O'Neal Saga of a Married Man (Eagle) *** \u00a313.99 Although he hasn't visited the top 10 since 1987, when Criticize became his biggest lady-inflaming hit, Alexander O'Neal still cuts a sharp-suited figure. His first album in three years isn't so different, in its smoothly macho R&amp;B style, from his breakthrough LP, Hearsay. His silken voice can still make even the most innocent lyric seem laden with sexual intent. But these songs could only be sung by a sadder-but-wiser middle-aged man in the aftermath of an extra-marital affair. The tune that most directly pertains to it, Married Man, is one of his sparsest, gliding regretfully through a landscape of chiding female vocals. He Said, She Said is pleasingly comparable to his early hit Fake, but You're Gonna Miss Me is the most retro of all, harking back to the moment when dance music meant squelching keyboards and lush backing vocals. Modern it isn't, but it should see many single women through Valentine's Day. (CS) La Bottine Souriante Anthologie (EMI) *** \u00a313.99 They may have lost out to the Afro-Celt Sound System at the Radio 3 world music awards this week, but La Bottine Souriante are still the most successful roots band in Quebec after 25 years, and one of the most rousing Francophone outfits anywhere. They start with Quebec's traditional mixture of French balladry and Irish reels, then mix in influences from New Orleans jazz to echoes of Latin styles. Their instrumentation is equally eclectic: fiddles, accordion, harmonica and jew's harp, a four-piece brass section and extensive percussive foot-stomping (the band's name means \"the smiling boot\"). This new anthology shows how different line-ups over the years have expanded the band's range. Many of the best tracks, La Chanson du Qu\u00e9teux for instance, are party songs involving a slick fusion of Celtic themes with jazzy brass and ragtime piano. But then they calm down for gently rousing ballads such as Le Rossignol Sauvage, relying only on harmony singing, percussion and fiddles. Classy stuff. (RD) Fu Manchu California Crossing (Mammoth Records) ** \u00a312.99 Bikini-clad girls, beaches and a hot rod carrying surfboards adorn the sleeve, but Fu Manchu aren't concerned with having fun. Instead, in true stoner-punk tradition, they're worried about UFOs and squashing flies. This is a strangely nihilistic celebration of all things Cali. It's packed with riffs that should only be played by a man in Spandex trousers, and features the shouty vocals of Scott Hill, who sounds as though he's attempting to communicate with the partially deaf in the middle of Piccadilly Circus at rush hour. Here, Fu keep true to their hardcore fanbase while warily embracing pop choruses. There's a lovely bass melody in Wiz Kid, but it's sacrificed to a speeding, hedonistic rhythm. Drummer Scott Reeder plays with a lot of heart - instrumental The Wastoid is his big moment - but maybe being the only truly inventive member of the band got to him: he left after this album was completed. (BC) Haven Between the Senses (Radiate) * \u00a313.99 Haven's debut does one thing brilliantly: it encapsulates everything that is wrong with the male-dominated guitar scene in Britain today. Their music is devoid of distinctive personality. Nat Wason's jangly riffs could just as easily be the work of Starsailor's James Walsh or Travis's Andy Dunlop. Singer Gary Briggs mistakes a maudlin, quivering wail for emotional delivery and lyrical cliches for accessible sentiments. The songs ooze ersatz passion but are woefully lacking in a sense of humour - so what does Johnny Marr, who produced Between the Senses, see in this band? The music Marr made with the Smiths was amusing, affecting and idiosyncratic: everything that Haven's music isn't. You could argue that these are early days, but there can be little hope for people so ready to settle for the mediocre. (MC) Soundtrack of Our Lives Behind the Music (WEA) **** \u00a312.99 Listening to Gothenburg's Soundtrack of Our Lives, anyone would think there wasn't much going on in modern-day Sweden. Their weird, parallel universe is frozen in time, around 1967. Their major influences are Love, the Beatles and Pink Floyd, although they may also be partial to a sly bit of Donovan. Even less encouragingly, they have been known to wear kaftans. And yet this is a marvellous album, with a pulsating, hallucinatory vibe that takes the breath away. Some songs - the plaintive In Someone Else's Mind (\"It's not exactly where I want to be\") - brim with off-kilter Syd Barratt twists. Others have grooves as insistent as anything in modern dance - intriguingly, their fans include both Oasis and the Chemical Brothers. SOOL's closest modern peers are Super Furry Animals, but even the Furries might baulk at the retro-ism of 21st Century Rip Off, which, with just detectable irony, insists that modern life is rubbish. Still, the glorious sounds here provide a convincing argument to join SOOL in their lovingly built sonic time-capsule. (DS)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
