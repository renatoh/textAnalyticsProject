In a decision that has left Arsenal privately stunned, Prokas will walk away scot-free from the tackle that left Vieira with a shattered shin pad and a gash below his right knee during Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie, even though the referee Steve Lodge later admitted he would have sent him off had he been better placed to see the incident. The Barnsley official initially deemed the incident \"a fair, 50-50 challenge\". Had he missed the tackle entirely the FA could have referred the matter to its video panel. \"But we can't because the referee has actually seen it and chosen how to deal with it,\" said the FA spokesman Adrian Bevington. \"Under our disciplinary rules there's nothing we can do regarding this particular matter. It's unfortunate that the referee clearly feels he would have made a different decision had he had the benefit of the television angle.\" The FA is anxious not to reduce referees' roles by overturning their decisions with the help of video evidence. As a result, the third eye can only be used to consider events that the match officials have missed or cases of mistaken identity and wrongful dismissal. Meanwhile Vieira has launched an attack on the FA as he awaits news of his own punishment, courtesy of the video panel, for his clashes with Olivier Dacourt and Eirik Bakke during Arsenal's 1-0 defeat at Leeds on November 26. The 24-year-old, who has not been booked since August, faces a three-match ban for the challenges, which were missed by the referee Dermot Gallagher. Though the FA insists Gallagher did not see either incident, Vieira told the French magazine Onze Mon dial: \"The referee said that he was perfectly placed and saw what went on, and also said similar incidents happen in games all the time. \"But afterwards a commission watched the video of the match and decided to charge me. This is typical English-style stupidity. It would really stick in my throat to earn a suspension as a result, and it would also have serious implications as far as referees are concerned. It would call their honesty and ability into question. \"If a referee says he has seen everything and it is all fine, then you get punished because of a video, that is total rubbish. It is like saying that referees are good for nothing beyond strutting round like penguins.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
