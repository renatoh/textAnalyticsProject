The clips, which were used without permission from the BBC, featured Kuenssberg saying the words \u201cpointless delay to Brexit\u201d, though she in fact appears to have been quoting Boris Johnson. Edwards is then shown talking about \u201canother Brexit delay\u201d followed by shaky footage of opposition leaders set to threatening music. On Sunday evening Huw Edwards praised the move by Facebook to ban the advert. He tweeted: \u201cGood. My thoughts on this kind of stunt are unprintable\u201d. A BBC spokesperson also said the corporation \u201cwelcomed the decision\u201d. On Thursday the BBC demanded that the paid-for advert, which targets older male voters, be taken down. \u201c This is a completely unacceptable use of BBC content which distorts our output and which could damage perceptions of our impartiality,\u201d they said. However, the Tories rejected the BBC\u2019s request, saying it was \u201cclear the footage was not edited in a manner that misleads or changes the reporting\u201d. In a statement on Sunday, Facebook said: \u201cWe have removed this content following a valid intellectual property claim from the rights holder, the BBC. Whenever we receive valid IP claims against content on the platform, in advertising or elsewhere, we act in accordance with our policies and take action as required.\u201d The advert ban came as the Conservatives face rising criticism for several controversial tactics used in this election campaign. During a televised election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn in November their press office temporarily rebranded on Twitter as a fact checker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
