In 24 hours' time the weather is likely to be the same for the Norwich Union British grand prix but the fastest man in the world this year does not care. \"The weather has no effect on me,\" says Gay. \"I would like to break the 100m world record and, if I have the right conditions, it can happen. But conditions do not have to be hot. Sometimes the colder it is, the quicker I can run. Psychologically, it means I will warm up harder, I will race harder and the excitement of seeing the crowd coming out to watch in the rain lifts me. It was cold in Lausanne this week and I still ran fast.\" At 24 Gay finds himself in a strange position. No athlete has run faster this summer than the 9.84 he clocked to win the 100m at the USA Championships in Indianapolis last month on the same weekend where he also won the 200m in 19.62, the second quickest time in history behind Michael Johnson. Yet it is almost the year's anniversary of the news of his American team-mate Justin Gatlin testing positive for drugs and Gay is now paying the price for that deceit. It is something he - and the sport - has to live with. Gatlin, the reigning Olympic champion, is still battling to avoid an eight-year suspension after being exposed as a cheat just months after he had equalled the Jamaican Asafa Powell's 100m world record of 9.77. Even though Gay ended last year as the world's second fastest at the 100m - with 9.84 again - and third in the 200m with 19.68, he knows he is competing under suspicion because of Gatlin. \"When I started running good at the beginning of the year I was getting a lot of drug questions,\" said Gay. \"They are really focusing on it in the USA. Someone wrote an article about me insinuating I have to be on drugs. \"It was hard at first but now I roll with it. It does not bother me any more. I understand where people are coming from. I hope I can change that attitude. But the amazing thing about me is that I did better than what Justin Gatlin did at the USA trials and he was on drugs.\" And how would he react should he meet Gatlin again? \"I would not know what to say to him at all,\" said Gay. \"Maybe the way he carried himself made it bad for the sport. I carry myself in a similar way but he tested positive. If you are running fast, that is what people are going to assume. I want to run faster than the guys did when they were on illegal substances. Maybe that would change the attitude of people.\" Gay comes originally from Lexington, Kentucky, and athletics became his sport as other activities gradually fell by the - wayside. He used to play basketball but he could not find the right co-ordination, though he is quickly mastering what he needs to solidify his progress this summer. He has been working on his starts, albeit under the extraordinary arrangement of being guided by a coach who is in prison. Gay has been with Lance Brauman for five years but last November his mentor was jailed for embezzlement. Brauman was found guilty of mail fraud and the theft of taking money from students to pay athletes for work they did not do while he was a coach at Barton County Community College in Kansas. But before he began his sentence, he sent Gay a training schedule for the whole year. The pair speak regularly on the telephone and the sprinter has been to visit him twice. \"He has 45 days to go until he gets out,\" said Gay. \"He called me here yesterday as I was making my way to the hotel to talk about what I should do in this race. I have not lost any respect for him. He has probably done a lot of maturing while he has been locked up.\" Brauman will be released during the world championships in Osaka next month where the confrontation between Gay and Powell could be a classic duel. Even though Powell, who is also 24, has been one of the dominant forces at the 100m since he first broke the world record by running 9.77 in Athens in 2005, he has not won a global title. \"We could develop a great rivalry,\" said Gay. \"We are both trying to gain a world title this year.\" It is likely that they may not meet until Japan but Gay will not mind that. \"I do not feel any pressure,\" he said. \"I do not have records or medals. I just have some fast times. Maybe Asafa will feel the pressure because he is the world record holder.\" Unless Gay defies the elements in Sheffield tonight - without an umbrella.
