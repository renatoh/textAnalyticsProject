Don't read ahead if you haven't seen season two, episode four. Rebecca Nicholson's episode three blog Shake and Fingerpop It's Jason's turn for the ominous darkness and creepy crickets this week, as he returns to his holy dorm room to discover what appears to be a massacre. Only it's a set-up, courtesy of jealous Luke, who ends up on the floor for his trouble. Later the happy campers have an amusing conversation about which biblical characters might have been vampires \u2013 Jesus, Cain and Eve are all considered \u2013 but it's Jason's ascension to the house of Steve and saucy Sarah which is the most promising part of the whole Fellowship of the Sun debacle. That is until Eric, Bill, Jessica, Sookie and the mysteriously absent Godric are all drawn towards the church thanks to their as-yet-unexplained thwarted kidnap attempt at the airport. Pulling half of the main characters away from Bon Temps really livens up this week's episode, and exploring Hotel Carmilla's vampire-specific set-up is as much of a treat as the Bill-Jessica scenes continue to be. Light blockable rooms and the novel room service \u2013 straight, male, B-negative (with the hair of Fabio) for Jessica \u2013 catered to the whims and fancies of its undead clientele, and in true hotel rip-off tradition, a Tru Blood cost $45. Nice touch. It's starting to look like the Fellowship are involved in Godric's disappearance, and it's clear that Eric has some serious investment in finding his sheriff. But what is it? The biggest reveal of all is that Maryann is the claw monster, as predicted by some of you eagle-eyed commenters. I'm happy to leave the mythology spotting to the thorough and admirable work of @Scamander, but how does one piece together a nice white dress, the ability to turn eyes dark and induce mass-lusty-madness, big claws and, from what I heard, a chant of \"lolo enoche\" (which sounds like an adult entertainer). Here's an alternative theory \u2013 Maryann is the commissioner of the Bravo channel, and she's working on a new series of Booze Britain. I defy you to spot the difference between what just happened in Sookie's back yard and the after effects of a Friday night town centre happy hour. After all that excitement, and with the promise of the church and Dallas threads coming together rather nicely, the cliffhanger was a bit of a let down. But who is Barry the Bellhop? And why is he so keen to get away from his psychic ability doppelganger? NSFW-ometer So Maryann isn't just a party monster (wink wink) \u2013 she brings the full bacchanalian revelry with her every time she decides to crack open the fizz. And unless your name is Hef and your occupation is stud, orgies are very much NSFW. Body count No deaths tonight. Even Eric is all about the healing; curing Lafayette's gammy leg with his blood, though to potentially sinister ends. Line of the week \"Bang it baby, bang it baby, ahhh, ahhh\" \u2013 Lafayette is back to his usual self, and then some. That's spectacular dancing from Nelsan Ellis. Notes \u2022 I shamefully paused and noted the \"adult films\" on offer in the Hotel Carmilla. That would be Intercourse With a Vampire, His First Fangbang and Co-Ed Chowdown. Just in case you were curious. \u2022 On a similarly smutty note, Sookie might be capable of instigating some of her own Intercourse With a Vampire, but she is still incapable of swearing beyond \"fudge\". \u2022 Jason was given a very un-Jason-like witticism in the \"God will make sure evil gets punished\" \u2013 \"Then explain Europe to me\" riff. Funny, but sounded odd from him. \u2022 Also funny \u2013 Jessica getting stuck in her travel coffin. I love Jessica. I might have mentioned this already. \u2022 Dippy Daphne knows Sam's secret. But how? Is she trustworthy? I'm not so sure. She seems to have conveniently ended up at Merlotte's waitressing, even though she's a terrible waitress. Plus, you know, there's those (presumably) Maryann-inflicted scars. \u2022 That they were only just conducting the autopsy on Ms Jeanette emphasised the narrow time frame that season one and two have happened in. In my mind, she died ages ago, but it's obviously only a matter of days. These rolling episodes are deceptive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
