They become more so as the day of Tony Blair's departure approaches. If, as David Cameron suggested yesterday, he has 12 weeks to go, then there may be just nine more of these sessions. I can't imagine that under Gordon Brown they will be quite as surreal, as nutty, or as plump with possibility. We started with Iran and the news that Tehran had given coordinates for the seized British vessel. These proved that, contrary to what they'd said, it had been inside Iraqi territorial waters all along. When the British pointed this out, the Iranians simply changed the coordinates. We should not assume that, just because our government has an uneasy relationship with the truth, like a cat and a dog sharing the same basket, it is more mendacious than a religious tyranny. I believe our lot. Mr Cameron wanted to know if our men had \"clear rules of engagement\". This is military-speak for \"when can they start killing people?\" and brought a sharp, \"did he really say that?\" intake of breath from everyone. Mr Blair said crisply that, in effect, they could have opened fire, but it would, in the circumstances, have been a bloody silly idea. (Almost exactly 25 years ago, Enoch Powell wanted courts martial for the tiny Falklands garrison that surrendered to the massed Argentinians.) Stewart Jackson asked about Sir Alistair Graham, the \"sleaze watchdog\" who has made an attack on Tony Blair for bringing politics into yet more discredit. \"I completely and totally disagree with Sir Alistair,\" he replied. \"He is entitled to his opinion, but I am entitled to mine!\" Well, that's more of a riposte than a reply, a rebuttal rather than a refutation. On we went. Mr Cameron asked about taxes on small business. \"You've only got 12 weeks left as first lord of the Treasury. Instead of a pointless search for the environment secretary's backbone, why don't you withdraw the tax?\" Whizzee? Whizzee? (\"Where is he?\") shouted the Tories. They meant Gordon Brown. But we can guess where - in front of a television, mouthing imprecations like a tramp waving a can of Special Brew. But Mr Cameron was looking to the future. Young Miliband, of whom he spoke, will not run for leadership of the Labour party this time. It would be an act of such stupidity that it would rule him unfit for being leader at all. Still, he may get the job after the Tories win, so it's a sound idea to portray him as a milquetoast now. Then David Taylor asked about the Pope's view that the EU was losing its Christian roots and was guilty of apostasy. \"As a leading Christian , would you care to comment on the Pope's view?\" Comment? Are you mad? Is Tony Blair almost a Catholic? He doesn't, as Alistair Campbell once told us, \"do\" God. He was reduced to squirming near-silence. \"Frankly, I wouldn't, um, um, I don't think, the, er, Pope, needs me as his spokesman. \"I think it is better that the Pope makes his statements and I make mine.\" He may have got away with that in the Commons, but I can assure him, it won't wash with St Peter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
