He\u2019s an acute social observer, so he starts to check the facts of this decade and is shocked by what he finds. Wherever he looks, whatever he checks, he finds the scars of austerity are all around \u2013 and he assumes that\u2019s what the candidates will confront. Talking to staff from his hospital bed he hears of 100,000 unfilled vacancies for overstressed NHS staff, with 2 million more people on hospital waiting lists. What kind of aftercare will he get, he asks? Not much, they say, with 1.4 million fewer frail people getting any social care, due to local councils stripped of half their funds. Van Winkle starts to Google key social indicators and grows increasingly appalled. Schools, many dilapidated, have lost funds of 8% per pupil, with sixth forms and colleges cut by 16%, losing teachers. Art, dance, design, music and drama teachers have been stripped out in many schools after the former education secretary Michael Gove downgraded them for his Gradgrind five English Baccalaureate subjects. He is sad to see that Sure Start children\u2019s centres barely exist. Children are hungry, he finds, as the threshold for free school meals has risen steeply. He checks the Institute for Fiscal Studies site and cries, Good grief! Pay has stagnated, and incomes still haven\u2019t caught up with a decade ago, unknown since Napoleonic times. Good God, he exclaims when he finds four in 10 children are living in poverty, the highest proportion for 60 years. He doesn\u2019t recognise the term \u201cfood bank\u201d, but he finds there are now more than 2,000, catering for a million hungry families. Why? He checks what happened to social security, and sees the gigantic size of benefit cuts. Look, he tells the patient in the next bed. For the first time in our lives, longevity is falling not rising: a year has been cropped off his lifespan while he slept. Worse, infant mortality has risen for the past two years \u2013 something unknown in his lifetime. The number of children in care has doubled, as cutbacks in social workers mean there\u2019s no one to help families before they reach crisis. Outside the window, he can see rough sleepers huddled against hospital walls: sure enough, he checks to find them up by 250%. How\u2019s the economy? Graphs for growth, per-capita income and public spending are too depressing to go on reading. But he notes there are twice as many billionaires as a decade ago, and 30% have avoided tax by keeping their cash offshore. When Van Winkle first woke, he had been eager to find out what brave new world of social progress had sprung up in his absence. Depressed, he turns on the bedside TV. On the news channel he finds an array of press conferences for prime ministerial candidates. He watches them strut their stuff in interviews, and follows their self-promoting newspaper articles. The word Brexit at first puzzles him, but then appals him as he pieces together the mighty political catastrophe that has befallen the country. Boris Johnson as frontrunner makes him yearn to fall back into a coma. He notes the rank hypocrisy of Gove snorting coke and the next day writing a bombastic anti-drug column in the Times. But even that seems less outrageous than Johnson\u2019s sociopathic knack for cheating, lying and misleading voters, mysteriously forever invulnerable. But Van Winkle has more pressing questions as he listens to the candidates\u2019 policy pitches, horribly familiar and apparently ignorant of the depth of the decade\u2019s damage. Are they all in denial? Dominic Raab will cut 5p off the basic income tax rate, set the top rate at 35% and now hurries to cut national insurance for the lowest paid. Jeremy Hunt will drop corporation tax to just 12.5% \u2013 from 28% a decade ago \u2013 and abolish tuition fees for graduates if they become entrepreneurs (expect a steep rise in bogus \u201cself-employed\u201d people). And he will double defence spending, yes double! Johnson will refuse to pay our \u00a339bn debt to the European Union, making Britain a rogue state, while he cuts tax for the 3 million best-off, raising the 40% threshold from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000. The IFS says this will especially benefit rich pensioners \u2013 and costs \u00a39.6bn \u2013 yet Johnson proclaims: \u201cI am a One Nation Conservative!\u201d He recently called for cuts to stamp duty and capital gains too \u2013 bonanzas for the well off. His promise of \u00a35,000 for every pupil exploded as it turned out to add just 0.1% to the schools budget. But that\u2019s just naughty Boris. Gove will abolish VAT, swapping it for a lesser sales tax. \u201cI value every individual. I want everyone to be the author of their own life story\u201d \u2013 which sounds as if that means no one should expect help from the state for anything. Esther McVey would also purloin the \u00a339bn owed to the EU, to spend on a public sector pay rise. Only Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart eschew the fairyland of competing tax cuts. As for Brexit, whether it\u2019s \u201cReady to Lead\u201d with Gove or \u201cReady for Raab\u201d, this is all dreamland Brextasy. Van Winkle sinks into gloom at candidates\u2019 familiar boasts that Britain will rule the waves again. These ministers, responsible for every aspect of British life, seem utterly oblivious of the mountain to climb just to get back to 2010, yet promise everything \u201cworld class\u201d and \u201cworld beating\u201d. \u201cI want to make Britain walk tall in the world again,\u201d proclaims Hunt. \u201cI want to make us the fastest growing most dynamic, pro-business, pro-enterprise, hi-tech economy in Europe.\u201d The Brexit reflex is just another twitch of the old imperial fantasy, Van Winkle notes. Why can\u2019t our politicians express a dignified patriotic love of country without world-class bragging that only makes us look absurd in our current state? Gove does it too: \u201cWith Brexit, this can be the best country in the world.\u201d He promises to \u201cmake Britain the best place to live, learn, raise a family, achieve your potential, and start and run a business\u201d. Is that restoring benefits, raising school spending to our competitors\u2019 level, repairing social care and health \u2013 while cutting taxes too? In fact-free mode, Gove boasts how many schools he improved. By now Van Winkle is weary of the backstories paraded: fish-dealer father, bus-driver father, time in care, rambling in Afghanistan, running a business. Who cares? Just start with tax and spend numbers that add up. Wasn\u2019t this once the competent party? Which of them will admit the state into which they have plunged the country? All are clueless as to what it would take to repair. Pondering so many tax cuts, Van Winkle wonders what other public services could be sliced away? He is glad to see he is not alone: Paul Johnson, IFS guru, has blown the whole lot of them to kingdom come, totting up their billions of spending and billions of tax cuts, appalled they have \u201cno fiscal strategy\u201d, no \u201cseriousness\u201d \u2013 leaving treasury heads banging on their desks. Van Winkle\u2019s head aches and he calls for pain relief. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
