In his first meeting with the new French president in Downing Street, Cameron will also ask Hollande to uphold an informal deal with his predecessor on Britain's EU rebate. Cameron agreed not to demand major changes to the Common Agricultural Policy, which benefits French farmers, in exchange from an undertaking from Sarkozy to leave alone Britain's \u00a32.7bn annual EU rebate. French officials have made clear in recent weeks that they are not minded to uphold the informal arrangement during the forthcoming negotiations on the EU budget for the period 2014-2020. Downing Street is hoping that Tuesday's meeting will foster a warmer relationship with Hollande after Cameron declined to meet him during his visit to London at the height of the French presidential election. But the prime minister is planning to explain in greater detail his warning at last month's EU summit that Britain will demand \"safeguards\" to protect its position when eurozone leaders draw up new governance arrangements. Britain fears that moves towards a fiscal union in the eurozone could undermine the EU's single market which applies to all 27 member states. Cameron will also make clear that Britain would use the discussions to demand a renegotiation of Britain's position in the EU, possibly by demanding the repatriation of social and employment laws. The prime minister's spokesman said: \"The agenda will focus on the range of bilateral issues. I would expect them to cover the economy, the situation in the eurozone. I would expect them to cover a number of foreign policy issues and our ongoing co-operation with the French on defence.\" William Hague will underline the government's commitment to repatriating powers from Brussels at the launch of a report by the Fresh Start group of eurosceptic Conservative MPs. The report has a line-by-line analysis of every policy area, with an assessment of the likelihood of of success in repatriating powers. It breaks these down into three areas using traffic lights: green lights for changes that can be made immediately, such as opting out of 130 justice and home affairs laws; amber lights for changes that would need treaty change, such as repatriation of social and employment laws; and red lights for confrontational proposals such as unilateral withdrawal from the CAP. George Eustice, one of the report's authors, said: \"Our timetable for action sets out what the government could achieve and by when. We reject the view of defeatists who say it is impossible to renegotiate our membership of the EU. There are things that the government could do right now, such as opt out of 130 justice and home affairs laws. There are other things, such as repatriating control of employment law which may be matters for our next manifesto. But the important thing is to begin the process now.\" Andrea Leadsom, one of the driving forces behind the Fresh Start group, said: \"Events in Europe mean that the way the EU operates is bound to change significantly. Over the coming years, there will be a series of opportunities for the UK to take back power from Brussels. This is the perfect chance for us to negotiate a radically different relationship with the EU, one which properly serves Britain's interests. \"We believe strongly that the government must adopt an approach to these negotiations which is completely different from previous practice. There must be no more of Britain's traditional reserve \u2013 we must get the best deal for Britain and not worry about others' feelings. This is not the time for Whitehall's 'two key points' negotiating approach \u2013 we need a shopping list of requirements, which will enable ministers to secure the right package.\" Chris Heaton-Harris, the former Tory MEP who is now MP for Daventry, said: \"When the renegotiation is complete, the British people must have their say - there must be a referendum on what any new relationship looks like.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
