The French striker, at the Stadium of Light on a season's loan, does not want to return to Marseille and seems willing to stay on Wearside but is unimpressed that Sunderland have not yet decided whether they want to pay around \u00a310m for him. Considering that Ciss\u00e9 earns around \u00a360,000 a week, his plight is unlikely to attract sympathy in north-east England, where redundancies are mounting, but this has not prevented the former Liverpool forward playing the 'family' card. \"It is not nice to worry about where I am going to be in a few months' time,\" he said. \"It is not just affecting me \u2013 I have family and children to think about. It is really annoying me, to be honest. I would like to know where I am going to be next season.\" Ciss\u00e9, who has just over two years remaining on his contract at Marseille, drew scathing criticism from Sunderland's manager, Ricky Sbragia, over his failure to hold the ball up and retain possession during Saturday's 1-1 Premier League draw at home against Tottenham Hotspur. The 27-year-old appeared upset when he was withdrawn in the second half but today claimed he would not be unhappy to stay on Wearside next season. Ciss\u00e9, whose 10 goals this season make him Sunderland's leading scorer, said: \"I don't really want to go back to Marseille. I would not have a problem with staying here. I have had some good moments with Sunderland and there are 10 games to go this season so hopefully there will be more.\" No decisions will be made until Sunderland, perched five points above the drop zone, know whether they are safe from relegation, although matters are further complicated by the collapse of sterling against the euro. Last summer Marseille and Sunderland agreed a provisional fee in euros to be paid for Ciss\u00e9 this summer. However, whereas the agreed sum was then equivalent to \u00a38m it has now risen to \u00a310m. The Frenchman, meanwhile, has failed to forge a convincing partnership with his co-striker, Kenwyne Jones. \"I know things have changed because the British currency is not as strong,\" Ciss\u00e9 acknowledged. \"We also need to get points to make sure we stay in the Premier League \u2013 that is everybody's priority. It is no one's fault that the decision is not made but I still need to know.\"Although Ciss\u00e9, signed by Sbragia's predecessor Roy Keane, attracted criticism on Saturday, club sources say his overall attitude has improved since his good friends and fellow French speakers Pascal Chimbonda and El Hadji Diouf departed Sunderland during January. Even so the striker has not always seen eye to eye with team-mates and is, in the past, understood to have had an altercation with Andy Reid, Sunderland's popular midfielder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
