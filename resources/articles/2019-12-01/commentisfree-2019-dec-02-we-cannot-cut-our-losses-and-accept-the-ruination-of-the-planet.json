Bishop writes of loss and its acceptance, themes with a new and awful currency in the time of environmental collapse. For this is an era in which, to borrow her words, \u201cso many things seem filled with the intent/to be lost\u201d. We\u2019ve just watched koalas, creatures already at risk from deforestation, incinerated in their hundreds (perhaps thousands). We lost millions of other animals at the same time, and the devastation of habitats will doom more in the months ahead, especially since ecosystems that never previously knew fire now burn for weeks. The Australian catastrophe mirrors events elsewhere. In the past 40 years, more than half the world\u2019s wildlife has gone. Rainforests are disappearing at the astonishing rate of 30 football fields a minute. Some estimates place 75% of coral reefs at risk from either local and global stress. As David Wallace-Wells says, most of the carbon we\u2019ve burned has been consumed since the premiere of Seinfeld. In the remarkably brief time bookended between now and a show about nothing, we\u2019ve set in train the destruction of wonders that we barely comprehend. Researchers recently proved that bees perform basic arithmetic, a gobsmacking discovery with profound implications about the nature of intelligence. Yet in Europe some 800 varieties of wild bee species appear on the critically endangered list, a subset of the 40% of all insect species said to be in decline. We know now that, like birds, reef fish sing a chorus to the sun each morning. We also know that, like birds, they\u2019re dying \u2013 fish populations throughout the oceans are decreasing precipitously. Bishop describes personal calamities in a poem referencing her notoriously painful childhood. She barely knew her father; she was separated from her mentally ill mother at an early age. After inheriting a private income, she travelled widely, on journeys not always happy. \u201cI lost two cities, lovely ones,\u201d she writes, \u201c\u2026 And, vaster, some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent. I miss them, but it wasn\u2019t a disaster.\u201d Today we cannot help but read those lines differently, with the devastation of cities, rivers and even continents an imminent prospect. Venice is flooding; the whole Murray-Darling basin is running dry; the Arctic (warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet) has been burning for months on end. Will we miss them? Will their destruction be a disaster? In the face of inevitable bereavement, Bishop writes of the acceptance \u2013 even the cultivation \u2013 of loss. \u201cLose something every day. Accept the fluster/of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\u201d In that way, she says, grief might become manageable. It\u2019s a strategy that many of us adopt. \u201cWe are on track,\u201d tweets the UN environment program, \u201cfor a temperature rise of over 3\u00b0C. This would bring mass extinctions &amp; large parts of the planet would be uninhabitable.\u201d Who can assimilate a warning like that? How do we go about our daily business knowing that unless something gives, much of the world will be ruined forever? Like Bishop, we adjust to small losses, one day at a time. We accept the strange absence of once common birds. We forget that, as children, we saw insects in great numbers and variety and now \u2026 we just don\u2019t. We adjust our holidays to visit the forests that aren\u2019t burned, the reefs that haven\u2019t bleached. Like Bishop, we tell ourselves: \u201cNone of these will bring disaster.\u201d Brecht, a more directly political writer, phrased the same thought somewhat differently in one of his anti-war poems. \u201cWhen evil-doing comes like falling rain, nobody calls out \u2018stop!\u2019 When crimes begin to pile up they become invisible.\u201d Or, at least, they become invisible for a while. In the shattering conclusion of One Art, Bishop addresses directly the loss that haunts the poem: the absence of her lover. \u201cEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture I love) I shan\u2019t have lied. It\u2019s evident the art of losing\u2019s not too hard to master though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster. In those lines the discipline of a very controlled poem collapses, precisely because, while some losses can be artfully mastered, others just cannot. The catastrophe unfolding around us falls into the second category. Whatever coping mechanism we adopt, no ironic distance will normalise the ruination of a planet: a disaster that cannot \u2013 must not! \u2013 be borne. \u2022 Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
