The reason was a stark warning from Tesco, down 13p to 313.5p, that rising fuel prices could add up to \u00a360m to costs this year. On top of that, the UK's biggest retailer also said that it would not be increasing its domestic sales forecast, partly because shoppers have less money in their pockets due to rising petrol and gas prices. The final scores showed the FTSE 100 down 13.3 points at 5,416.4 with Tesco, J Sainsbury, 8p cheaper at 275.5p, and Wm Morrison, 4.25p lighter at 178p, the three biggest fallers. Ironically, the blue chip index had touched a four-year high early in the session as the heavyweight oil stocks made further gains. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 eased 0.4 points to 7,929.8, while the FTSE Small Cap added 7.1 points to end at 3,156.6. Market turnover was good, with about 3bn shares changing hands. In the bond market, the 10-year gilt closed around 104.200, yielding 4.229%. BOC, the gases group which has been the subject of frenzied takeover speculation in recent weeks, was one of the day's main talking points as its shares came under further pressure. It lost 16p on Monday as traders banked profits, and the stock fell a further 23p to \u00a311.34 yesterday after Citigroup downgraded to \"hold\" from \"buy\". \"Our valuation judgments and recommendations are based on fundamentals and, on most metrics, we believe the stock is up with events,\" the US broker said. On top of the downgrade, traders also noted comments made by Kurt Bock, the finance director of rumoured predator BASF. In an interview, he said BASF's policy was to look for easily digestible small and medium-sized acquisitions. Whether BOC - market value nearly \u00a36bn - is a medium-sized company is debatable, although traders note that BASF's market value is \u20ac34bn (\u00a323bn). Anglo American, however, managed to buck the weak market trend. Its shares, \u00a314.33 a week ago, climbed a further 37p to \u00a316.01 - a record high - supported by the gold price, which touched its highest level since 1988 yesterday, and a Citigroup upgrade to \"buy\". The US broker believes Anglo American, for which it has set an \u00a318 target price, could improve its stock market rating by spinning off its industrial mineral and paper &amp; packaging divisions. Plant hire group Ashtead was one of the FTSE 250's best performers, rising 6.5p to 143.5p after announcing a 150% rise in first-quarter profits and predicting a successful outcome for the full year. LogicaCMG was another strong performer, rising 9.5p to 183.5p as traders were forced to buy back their short positions. These were opened on Friday as City speculators gambled Logica's \u00a3630m acquisition of French rival Unilog would go down badly in the Square Mile. That has not proved the case and all of Logica's biggest shareholders are backing the \u00a3390m rights issue which is being used to help finance the deal. Takeover speculation continued to swirl around engineering company Morgan Crucible, up 0.5p to 208.5p. Market professionals believe the company recently received and rejected a 260p-a-share offer from a rival which wants to get its hands on the company's ceramics division. On the downside, Electrocomponents, the distributor of electrical components, shed 15p to 245p after warning half-year profits are likely to be a third lower than last year because of poor trading in the UK. That news also unsettled rival Premier Farnell, which fell 6.25p to 154p. Benfield, the reinsurance group built up by former Chelsea boss Matthew Harding, dipped 3.25p to 295.75p as directors and staff sold stock worth \u00a335m through Merrill Lynch. Chairman John Coldman and Paul Keron, head of Benfield's US operations, were among the directors selling, disposing of stock worth \u00a32.2m and \u00a33.5m respectively. In the small cap arena, internet gaming company Empire Online took the wooden spoon, falling 51.5p to 202.5p on news that takeover talks with Sportingbet, 17p weaker at 326.5p, had been terminated. In the biotech sector, York Pharma, the dermatology specialist headed by Terry Sadler, climbed 12.5p to 122.5p after Nigel Wray, the millionaire owner of Saracens rugby club, appeared on its share register with a 3.4% stake. Gresham Computing improved 0.5p to 130.5p as buyers emerged ahead of the interim numbers, out tomorrow. NSB Retail Systems firmed 1p to 33.5p amid continued speculation that rival Torex Retail, 2p higher at 120p, is plotting a bid. Similar rumours saw Hunting, the oil services company, put on 3p to 307.5p. Oriel Resources was marked 5.75p higher at 35p on rumours that it is set to spin off its gold assets into a separately listed vehicle. Finally, SQS Software Quality Systems, now the first German company to have its primary stock market listing in the UK, made a good debut. Placed at 190p by Evolution Securities following a \u00a310.8m fundraising, its shares came to rest at 202.5p. Eyes on Aegis Advertising group Aegis was on the move again yesterday but this had nothing to do with the acquisition of a small Russian media company. Its shares gained 2.25p to 120.5p on the back of speculation that the company, which owns Carat, Europe's biggest media buying and planning agency, had received and rejected a 140p-a-share offer. The names in the frame were American advertising rival Omnicom, and Vincent Bollor\u00e9, the French corporate raider and chairman of advertising group Havas. In early August, Mr Bollor\u00e9 announced that he had amassed a 6% stake in Aegis, a move which fuelled rumours of a merger with Havas. With 23m Aegis shares changing hands yesterday, there was also talk that Mr Bollor\u00e9 had been in the market adding to his holding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
