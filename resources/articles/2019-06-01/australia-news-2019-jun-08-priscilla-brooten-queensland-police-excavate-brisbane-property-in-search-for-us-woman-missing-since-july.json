Priscilla Brooten was formally reported missing in December last year but the 46-year-old was last seen in July, in Bracken Ridge. The police confirmed that the cold case disappearance was now a homicide investigation. They were also forensically examining the house and a car at the property. \u201cI can confirm there\u2019s a 42-year-old gentleman from Bracken Ridge who is assisting police with their inquiries,\u201d detective senior sergeant Michael Hogan told reporters in Brisbane on Saturday. The pair had been in a relationship for a year before Brooten disappeared and police say the man failed to report her missing. Brooten has been described as an outgoing and friendly yoga and Zumba enthusiast. Police dogs had pinpointed a narrow strip of land in the front yard alongside the driveway where the search was concentrated. Brooten\u2019s blue Volkswagen Golf hatchback was found abandoned in Bunton Street, Scarborough about 9pm on Friday, 6 July 2018, and police had urged people who might have seen it to come forward. They believe the car was moved from Bracken Ridge. Hogan said Brooten was a keen gamer and appealed to her friends in the online gaming community to come forward with information. \u201cIt is certainly a possibility that we are keen to explore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might not have even known she was missing.\u201d Brooten\u2019s mother and daughter live in California and have been kept up to date with the search. They first contacted the police in July with concerns about Brooten\u2019s whereabouts. The police are yet to lay any charges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
