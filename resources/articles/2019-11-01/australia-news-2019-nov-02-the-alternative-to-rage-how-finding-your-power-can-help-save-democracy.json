The group gathers in a week where yet another multibillion-dollar company admits to large-scale underpayment of workers, as numerous Australians face a potentially blistering summer unsure of how they\u2019ll afford to pay their energy bills, people from Hong Kong to Latin America take to their streets against their regimes, and against a backdrop of record low trust not only in politicians in Australia but in democracy itself. \u201cLiberal democratic states depend on parties being responsive to the population, and largely speaking for the 20th century that was structured around class lines,\u201d Stears says. \u201cNow all sorts of things are fractured and parties here [in Australia] no longer reflect those stable social compositions, but nevertheless they carry on as if they did.\u201d People do not see their concerns or experiences reflected in debate from Madrid to Washington to Canberra, he says, and that is breeding a deep dissatisfaction with the prevailing political order. It is this frustration that has led to developments such as Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and rise of the far right. The unifying characteristic of this distrust and discontent around the world? Powerlessness. \u201cPeople increasingly feel like things are getting harder for them and the people they care about, and they can\u2019t think of a way to change that,\u201d Stears says. \u201cThey feel a sense of frustration that despite all their personal effort, they can\u2019t make it better. I think that\u2019s causing a lot of the rage. It is a global phenomenon of people saying politics as normal are not responding to our needs. We need to try something else.\u201d In western Sydney, ethnically diverse and lower socio-economic communities are feeling that discontent. Thuy Nguyen, of the Sydney Alliance, a coalition of diverse communities, says that individuals in the region have no faith in politicians, and feel their concerns are neither heard nor understood. \u201cWestern Sydney feels like the periphery,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels like we are on the margins of the centre where people actually have the power and agency to change their lot in life. I think there is some anger. \u201cWhen you feel that anger and you feel alone, that\u2019s when you look to someone on the TV, the strongman to solve your problem. But if you are able in public to tell the stories of your private pain, and someone next to you says \u2018I\u2019ve experienced the same thing\u2019, and to do that across diverse groups, it\u2019s a recognition that all of us are experiencing the same injustices. And we can\u2019t blame each other. That\u2019s the antidote to that rage.\u201d \u2018The solution to powerlessness is to find power\u2019 Nguyen, like many meeting at the Sydney Policy Lab, is facilitating community resistance and activism to intractable problems such as a lack of affordable housing, energy, and a labour market in which, for many people, work is becoming increasingly insecure and low-paid. \u201cPeople have woken up to the fact that the solution to powerlessness is to find more power,\u201d Stears says. Here are three examples of global communities finding their power: ENERGY: Voices for Power, Sydney Nguyen leads the Voices for Power campaign that brings together seven different community groups in western Sydney around the issue of access to affordable, sustainable power. Working with each community within that group\u2019s language and culture, they then convene leaders who set agendas for lobbying for things such as better energy-efficiency standards in rental accommodation and help these often disempowered communities to navigate the energy market. \u201cEvery time we meet a political leader, we show up in power \u2026 That\u2019s 14, up to 20 community leaders meeting the politician in a room,\u201d Nguyen says. \u201cThey\u2019re diverse, they\u2019re well organised, they\u2019ve got an agenda they\u2019ve agreed on. Politicians are not used to meeting these constituents.\u201d HOUSING: Reclaim the City, Cape Town In Cape Town a physical segregation of white and black continues, with black South Africans relegated to under-serviced and distant townships, says Nkosikhona Swartbooi of Ndifuna Ukwazi, which supports Reclaim the City. Facing the sale of public land to private developers in the centre of the city, Reclaim the City uses litigation and direct-action occupation of public buildings to demand social housing in central Cape Town, enabling black people to live in the city in which they work. They have so far managed to get 11 sites in the city released for public housing. \u201cThe principle is \u2018public land for public good\u2019,\u201d Swartbooi says. \u201cYou must realise land for its social value, as opposed to commodifying land and housing, therefore perpetuating the spatial inequality that you see in Cape Town.\u201d WAGES: Living Wage Campaign, London Since the beginning of the Living Wage Campaign in 2001, more than 1bn pounds (A$1.9bn) in extra wages has been secured for low-paid workers. Starting in London with a coalition of unions, faith groups and educational institutions, Stefan Baskerville, now of the UK\u2019s New Economics Foundation, says the success of the campaign was due to broad-base coalition, willingness to confront employers not paying workers enough to live on, and then making allies of those which reformed. But there was also something more fundamental about the campaign. \u201cThere was a simplicity and a moral clarity to the demand,\u201d he says. \u201cHow can it be right that you sit at the top of an organisation, and the person who cleans the carpet under your feet doesn\u2019t have enough to live on?\u201d \u2018NGOs are not the messiah\u2019 The shape of modern-day activism and community organisation is not necessarily flat and leaderless. Some kind of institution and distributed leadership is necessary to sustain effort and develop strategy, argue those meeting at Sydney Policy Lab. \u201cYou do see these vast protests which evolve into nothing because there\u2019s no organisation behind them, and everyone thinks they\u2019ve done their bit,\u201d Stears says. \u201cWhat you really need is people who can sustain months and months of action. Unless you do that, you\u2019re not going to make concrete changes.\u201d But in order to counteract the discontent caused by voicelessness and powerlessness, those at the lab agree, these movements and organisations do and must act as a springboard for people, not as their saviours. \u201cIt is not meant for NGOs to be the messiahs of their communities,\u201d Swartbooi says. \u201cIt\u2019s building people\u2019s power through educating them to know their rights, and making sure the skills and knowledge we have is transferred to communities.\u201d And in a society increasingly marked by division and distrust, listening is critical. \u201cIf you want to have a campaign about coal in Australia, you have to have people from coal communities as part of the relationship,\u201d Stears says. \u201cYou have to know what they\u2019ll think, what they\u2019re worried about. \u201cWe\u2019ve got into a habit of not doing that. We get outraged by an issue, so shout about it, but haven\u2019t built the relationships with people that are needed in the coalition. So you\u2019ve got to slow it down, even though it\u2019s urgent.\u201d \u2018Don\u2019t wait for your Brexit moment\u2019 Baskerville, the grandson of Jewish refugees who fled Nazi Germany, is acutely aware of what can happen when economic systems no longer work for people. \u201cThe dark thing about what is happening now politically is that it is polarising,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the rise of authoritarianism in places which are supposed to be the strongholds of democracy. \u201cThere is a critical mission before us to sustain democracy, and it rests not just on voting, it rests on people having agency and power, having the habits of relating to each other across difference.\u201d Stears says it is difficult to discern whether we are at a tipping point, or if a tipping point is about to come. \u201cThere\u2019s just no doubt that people are beside themselves, not just with anger but with fear. There\u2019s a sense that just awful things are already happening and worse things might happen unless we make some change.\u201d But both that sense of overwhelming powerlessness, and anger over things like the state of jobs, housing, climate, can be solved, he says, if people can organise and think through these problems imaginatively. The Brit warns Australia: \u201cDon\u2019t wait for your Brexit moment.\u201d The Global Gathering project was conceived and run by Dr Amanda Tattersall and Professor Kurt Iveson at the Sydney Policy Lab"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
