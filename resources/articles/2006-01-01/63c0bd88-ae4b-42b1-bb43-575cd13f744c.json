The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and Barnardo's backed the education secretary, Ruth Kelly's plan to automatically bar all known paedophiles and those who commit serious sexual offences against adults from ever working in schools. Her appointment of former Barnardo's chief executive Sir Roger Singleton to head a new panel to vet the suitability of staff to work with children also won approval form child protection experts. The reforms follow criticism of the decision by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) not to automatically place registered sex offenders on List 99, which lists those barred from working in schools Ms Kelly told MPs there were currently 88 people on the sex offenders register who had not been banned from working in schools. These included 56 not barred by the Labour government since it came to power in 1997. Chris Hanvey, director of Barnardo's, said: 'We are pleased that the government has listened to our advice and taken decision- making powers away from ministers, placing it with those who can balance the concerns of parents with fairness and have the knowledge and experience to make sound judgments on these matters.\" Mary Marsh, director of the NSPCC, welcomed the \"presumption that convictions or cautions for sex offences will automatically disqualify people from working with children\". She called for CRB checks to be extended to all professionals with direct and unsupervised access to children, including child minders and staff at creches and holiday activity schemes. Ms Marsh added that parents should also be allowed to order CRB checks on private carers and tutors. She said: \"If parents want to employ music teachers and tutors directly, they should have the right to check that these people pose no risk to their children.\" But some child protection experts said the new measures added few additional safeguards, warning it would be complacent to assume the measures would prevent paedophiles from gaining jobs in schools. Mr Hanvey said: \"It is important to remember that the majority of people who have abused children have no criminal record and that checks are only one part of the jigsaw in assessing a person's suitability for work with children. No one involved with children should be complacent. Employers still need to check references carefully and have thorough management and supervision procedures in place.\" Donald Findlater, manager of child protection helpline Stop It Now!, added: \"Schools, the police and probation services still need to remain vigilant. No one should assume that only those on the blacklist are a potential threat to children.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
