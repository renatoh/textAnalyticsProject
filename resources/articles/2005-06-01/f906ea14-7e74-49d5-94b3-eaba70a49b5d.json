Women outnumber men as pensioners by two to one, yet receive much lower incomes. Within couples, the man's income is on average 2 times that of their partner, while single women receive on average \u00a336 less per week than a male counterpart. But the report, by independent consultants, suggests the causes go beyond the fact that women are worse paid while working and are more likely to take career breaks. \"The idea ... persists that pension planning and provision is essentially a male role linked to breadwinning, and that women have other concerns to put first, namely the care of their children and families,\" write Wendy Sykes and Alan Hedges. They found that women knew less about their pension than did men; some men knew more about their partner's pension than they themselves did. While financial independence was more important to younger women, they too failed to plan for separation, divorce or bereavement. \u00b7 The Lib Dems yesterday tabled a motion to prevent a tax giveaway for wealthy executives in retirement. Their Treasury spokesman, Chris Huhne, asked unions to back a campaign to drop changes in the finance bill allowing purchase of holiday homes and buy-to-let properties tax-free using a pension fund. The cost to the Treasury is estimated at \u00a3500m to \u00a34bn a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
