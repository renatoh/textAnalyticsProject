It contains the expected nonchalant swing that characterises the disco revival of the past half-decade \u2013 but also the slightly numbed narcosis that's a hallmark of fellow French producers such as Chlo\u00e9 and Etienne Jaumet. These qualities make for uneasy bedfellows \u2013 but less because they jar interestingly, rather because they negate and detract from each other; too morose and anonymous to work as disco, too sunny and breezy to ever be really uncomfortable listening. It rarely puts a foot wrong, as such \u2013 apart from when Jarvis Cocker creeps unwanted into earshot, his voice as strained and smarmy as ever. But when even the steel drums on Falkenburg and the madcap circus piano on Grace sound too low-key to excite, there's something wrong. Amid its sluggishness, Discodeine sparkles intermittently \u2013 but too rarely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
