When the menswear designer started a Central Saint Martins art foundation course a decade ago, he thought he\u2019d end up being a painter or sculptor. But on the first day, someone advised the students that whatever they were considering, it was probably best not to do fashion. \u201cThey said: \u2018Don\u2019t bother trying because it\u2019s really competitive and too many apply to do it.\u2019\u201d Green smiles, remembering. \u201cI thought: \u2018Don\u2019t tell me what to do.\u2019\u201d Now Green is being lauded as the most exciting menswear designer in fashion. Since launching his own label in 2012, he\u2019s won British Menswear Designer of the Year twice. His clothes are sold in the best stores in the world and have been worn by the likes of Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna (his men\u2019s clothes have a cool, dedicated female following). You might have seen the costumes he made for Ridley Scott\u2019s 2017 film Alien: Covenant. You can find his garments and specially commissioned works at the current Heavenly Bodies fashion exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. This week, Green is the guest designer opening Pitti Uomo in Florence, one of the most important showcases for men\u2019s fashion in the world. For all his meteoric success, Green is not some flashy showman. Solid, with a genial, youthful face, he is described by the people who know him with endearments: \u201cOh, you\u2019ll love him. He\u2019s so sweet.\u201d Born and bred in Hendon, north London, like his parents and grandparents before him, Green still lives just round the corner from his mum. In the decadent bookshop-cum-caf\u00e9 where we meet in central London, all glossy wood and devil-red cocktail menus, he sits with a coffee and a roll of Trebor mints. His straight-talking manner belies a unique and imaginative way of seeing the world. When your debut collection causes the Daily Mail to mock you, captioning the wooden structures that frame models\u2019 faces with the immortal line \u201cWhat a plank!\u201d you\u2019re surely on to a good thing. And what Green has done for menswear is just what the industry needed. His work is a mix of wild artistry, conceptualisation and commercial business sense. The organisers of Pitti, where his guest spot comes in the wake of fellow acclaimed designers such as Raf Simons, JW Anderson and Off-White\u2019s Virgil Abloh, have praised his ability to \u201cinnovate menswear \u2018codes\u2019 without losing track of the contemporary market\u201d \u2013 meaning that while Green\u2019s shows provide drama, innovation and craft, his jackets and shirts shift units like nobody\u2019s business. Ask him about the concepts behind his show collections and he will lead you through a maze of fantastical word association that boggles and enchants the mind. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d Green admits, apologetically. The spring/summer 2018 collection was a comment on the bleak notion of paradise as aspirational lifestyle and the illusory search for the perfect body. The autumn/winter collection, about to hit the shops, started with the idea of the perfection of military wear, but looped into a questioning of the nature of time, a fusion of medievalism and futurism with Wicker Man-style wooden structures, graphic coats that look like bishops from another planet, T-shirts eaten by shirts, crocheted cropped vests and things \u201cmade in the wrong fabric\u201d. But Green doesn\u2019t really care whether you get that or not. Sometimes he thinks it\u2019s better not to say, and just let everyone project their own feelings on to his pieces. What he is keen on establishing is that his label focuses on the idea of uniform. \u201cEverything is based around ideas of workwear,\u201d he says. \u201cNot the uniform of stature, but uniform for function. My family are all carpenters, plumbers, upholsterers. My mum was a nurse. They all wore uniforms you could actually work in.\u201d Rather than being oppressive, Green sees uniform as democratic. \u201cAt school when you had no-uniform day, that was the point when everyone separated. You started judging each other on how cool or expensive your clothes were. You started seeing the different levels of rich and poor kids. But when you had uniforms, everyone was equal.\u201d Having said that, Green himself was a 15-year-old metalhead into Korn and Slipknot and doing everything he could to not look like he was in uniform. \u201cI was always getting sent home for not wearing the right trousers. Or to take a piercing out,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI had half a shaved head that I\u2019d do with a Bic razor and then draw on a pattern every day with a black marker. And then I went really normal, before Saint Martins. I got it all out of my system before art school, which is weird.\u201d Green began his course with little art history knowledge but an impulse to create. \u201cIt was just what I was good at,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI was always surrounded by make-y people. My mum was always doing craft things and there were lots of building materials from my dad \u2013 immersion boilers and stuff everywhere. At the weekends I\u2019d help my uncle do up a house or I\u2019d strip sofas for my godfather, who had an upholstery workshop.\u201d He was the first person in his family to go to university. The news that he was going to study fashion prompted a certain amount of eye-rolling. \u201cI think they were all a bit: \u2018The first one to ever go to university and he\u2019s doing colouring in\u2026\u2019\u201d During his BA he felt out of place. \u201cIt was very much the era of Alexander McQueen and Diane von Furstenberg, and everyone was doing florals and feminine. I wasn\u2019t fitting into that aesthetic.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until he did placements with two avant-garde designers, the Belgian Walter Van Beirendonck and the Dane Henrik Vibskov, that he began to see how he could forge a way. \u201cThey are outsider designers and they taught me that fashion could be about anything. It could be about DIY or workwear or uniform or craft. It doesn\u2019t have to be glamorous womenswear. And it could come from anywhere. Even where I was from.\u201d He went on to do an MA under the late, legendary Professor Louise Wilson, who gave him a full scholarship (\u201cI think she knew I was poor,\u201d he says.) After leaving, he was asked to do an installation for Fashion East\u2019s MAN platform, for which he made his first full collection. He thought it might get him a job somewhere. Instead, he found himself with his own label \u2013 \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what I was thinking all along but I didn\u2019t know it.\u201d The label is now stocked at Dover Street Market, Barneys in New York and SSENSE. Selfridges and Matches Fashion sell it in both their men\u2019s and women\u2019s departments. Last year, Green won \u00a3150,000 for the BFC/GQ Designer Menswear award, enabling him to launch a twice-yearly Core collection. Now about 70% of his sales come from there. \u201cWith the show anything is an option, it\u2019s fantasy or concept-led. But Core is the things from past collections that we\u2019d wear every day. When we\u2019re developing we\u2019re always asking: would your boyfriend wear that? Would you wear that every day or do you just quite like it? Can you sit down in it? Those very functional design discussions. It\u2019s a bit more like product development.\u201d It\u2019s a bit more like huge success, too. But he laughs off any idea of having arrived. \u201cWith fashion everything can change \u2013 nothing is permanent, you have to take each season as it comes,\u201d he says. \u201cSix months later and everyone\u2019s bored.\u201d Hardly. Step back and watch him fly higher."}, "isHosted": false}}}
