But sexting \u2013 exchanging sexualised images \u2013 between those aged under 18 should not normally become the subject of a police investigation if it involves children of a similar age in a relationship, the Crown Prosecution Service has recommended. The public consultation on updated guidance for lawyers about when antisocial internet use tips over into illegal activity is published at the start of Hate Crime Awareness Week to help prosecutors decide when to act. It follows a Childnet report this year that found one in four teenagers suffered abuse online from trolling because of their gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability or transgender identity. The CPS\u2019s social media guidelines also cover attacks on disabled people, violence against women and girls, and racial and religious, homophobic and transphobic hate crime. Their publication will stimulate debate about the limits of free speech online and may help develop a clearer consensus about what is acceptable behaviour. As well as \u201cvirtual mobbing\u201d and \u201cdog-piling\u201d which incite hatred, other forms of online harassment that the CPS believes can amount to criminal activity are encouraging the retweeting of grossly offensive messages, \u201cdoxxing\u201d \u2013 publishing personal information such as home address or bank details \u2013 or devising derogatory hashtags to target victims. Perpetrators who participate in or initiate hate campaigns may be charged with encouraging an offence under the Serious Crime Act 2007, the new guidelines suggest. Sexting cases, the CPS acknowledges, need to be carefully assessed particularly when they involve children. \u201cWhile it would not usually be in the public interest to prosecute consensual sharing of an image between two children of a similar age in a relationship, a prosecution may be appropriate in other scenarios, such as those involving exploitation, grooming or bullying,\u201d it is proposed. In more serious cases, the guidelines say, consideration may be given to the offence of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Other practices that may be considered illegal are \u201cbaiting\u201d \u2013 humiliating someone by labelling them as sexually promiscuous or posting Photoshopped images to disparage victims. \u201cSocial media can be used to educate, entertain and enlighten but there are also people who use it to bully, intimidate and harass,\u201d Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, said. \u201cIgnorance is not a defence and perceived anonymity is not an escape. Those who commit these acts, or encourage others to do the same, can and will be prosecuted.\u201d The DPP added: \u201cWe welcome the comments and opinions of communities and those affected by hate crimes to help us inform the way we deal with such cases in the future. Our latest hate crime report showed that in 2015-16 more hate crime prosecutions were completed than ever before. \u201cMore than four in five prosecuted hate crimes result in a conviction, with over 73% guilty pleas, which is good news for victims. We have undertaken considerable steps to improve our prosecution of hate crime and we are committed to sustaining these efforts.\u201d There was a large reported rise in racial hate crimes in the aftermath of the EU referendum. Police forces have also complained about the growing burden of cybercrime investigations. Prosecutors are reminded in the guidelines that the threshold for legal action under the Malicious Communications Act 1988 and the Communications Act 2003 is the sending of a communication that is deemed grossly offensive. It adds: \u201cA communication sent has to be more than simply offensive to be contrary to the criminal law.\u201d Messages that are merely satirical, iconoclastic, rude or involve expressions of unpopular or unfashionable opinion will not constitute a criminal offence. Consultation on the CPS guidelines opens on Monday and lasts for 13 weeks. The CPS, created in 1986, is celebrating its 30th anniversary this month.
