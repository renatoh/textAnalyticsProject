But I did spend much time in the holidays glancing at each word, before turning the page. A similar process sometimes happens in my classroom. We're studying Chinua Achebe's poem Vultures. We've spent two lessons discussing it. The students are about to do a little writing, answer a few questions, and it emerges that half the class are clueless as to what is going on. I believe I've gone through a foolproof checklist: I've made sure everyone understands difficult vocabulary; repeated every idea; asked questions of those who didn't have their hands up; explained ideas using scenarios my students are familiar with; and used visual aids. And yet still there are blank faces. The questions that run through my mind are these: What is an acceptable level of literacy to leave school with? What am I doing to improve students' literacy in the classroom? And then, how important is literacy for life? The GCSE English syllabus I teach allows space for students who struggle with literacy to succeed. There are coursework pieces and exams in which marks are awarded for expressing understanding. Literacy is not neglected, but it is sidelined. It is not at all impossible to get a \"C\" grade at GCSE lacking secure literacy skills. Deeply embedded somewhere in Ulysses there is a mistake in a letter. Martha writes to Henry \"I do not like that other world\" when she intends to express her dislike for \"that other word\". The mistake points to other worlds of meaning. This mistake seems to show possibilities. I'm afraid that in the classroom, mistakes in basic literacy rarely do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
