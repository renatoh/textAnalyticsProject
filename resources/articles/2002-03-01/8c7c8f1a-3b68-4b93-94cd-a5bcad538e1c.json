Oh, for Streaming Out Loud! tells the story so far, which hinges on the system's patent holders charging not just for encoders and decoders but putting a tax on streamed media. Given that Microsoft's system is or soon will be better than MPEG-4, consumers will have the choice of using that for nothing or paying more for an inferior result. It is a safe bet that almost no-one will choose MPEG-4 except the ones who are not given a choice -- people with mobile phones, perhaps, who are used to being ripped off, and are paying enough for the MPEG-4 tax to be subsumed into their connection charges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
