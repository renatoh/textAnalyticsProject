When I set up the camera, I was simply planning to photograph an intimate moment. Then she started talking. They were divorcing at the time, my parents, and she was going on and on about how to get guys, how all they want is sex, and how to wear a push-up bra. It was so funny. I didn't set any artificial lights up \u2013 there was a window in the ceiling, so there was daylight coming through. I didn't want to lose the moment so I just had the camera on autoexposure and kept putting on the self-timer, going backwards and forwards to the camera, laughing all the time. She was having fun with me, but also performing for the camera. I've learned to take pictures while I'm living my life, to capture things almost by accident. Some photographers gain something by carefully planning things out, but I don't. My pictures often work out better if I'm rushed. I am very close to my mother. What makes this shot so dear to me is that it was taken at a difficult time in my life; virtually everything happening then made me closer to her. I needed her comfort, her sense of humour. I've been photographing her since I was 15 and she has learned to live in front of the camera. Sometimes she acts up, giving it a special kind of attention. My father always just let me take my pictures, but my mother definitely gained something from being photographed, discovering things about herself through them. It's funny because she's started to date men. She told the first guy she liked about my website \u2013 and he disappeared from her life. So now, when she doesn't like a guy so much, she tells him to look at my work, and so she gets rid of them. She says it's much easier than saying to them: \"It's not you, it's me,\" or, \"I'm not ready for this.\" I'm not aware, as I work, of being in the middle of a certain kind of period. But later, when I looked back at the pictures I took at this time, I could see that my husband and I were in crisis. Things come and go in your life, but my mum will always be my mum. I will be photographing her for ever. In short Born: Jerusalem, 1971 Studied: Photography at the Academy of Art and Design, Jerusalem Inspirations: \"Sally Mann and Nan Goldin. And I love Richard Billingham's pictures of his parents.\" High point: \"When I won the Infinity award. But also getting emails from people I don't know. I can be so moved.\" Pet hate: \"Pet hate: The career part of photography, the recognition that I do or don't get. All this I hate.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
