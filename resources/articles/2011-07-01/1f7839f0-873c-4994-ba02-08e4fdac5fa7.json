Tiny things. The way (they used to do this, you know) a car's window-wipers would stick to a halt wherever they were when the ignition was turned off. The wrinkles at the top of a lady's stockings when she's tucking a scribbled note there in the absence of a handbag. Then there are the lines, such as that delivered by Anna Chancellor, just one of the smart female cookies inside a fast-changing BBC at time of the Suez crisis, when she notes that the chap translating the crucial Cairo speech down the phone for them is \"the only Englishman still equally proficient in both the languages of Nasser's classical Arabic and the Egyptian vernacular\". Try getting that line past anyone on TV since the death of Morse, outside perhaps the new Sherlock. But this is what Abi Morgan does: relentless research, relentless refusal to talk down and relentless storytelling in a medium \u2013 TV \u2013 that she seems to love now for its need for narrative drive. She cherishes the exploration of ideas bestowed by her first love \u2013 theatre. The Hour, which is broadcast on BBC2 next week and over six successive hour-long episodes, is, it could be argued, the perfect amalgam for Morgan's theatrical and televisual talents, marrying ultra-tense, single-issue personal stand-offs with a cohesive six-week dramatic strand linking all the individual stories. And it's going to be a big one. It's having the fine resources of the BBC's drama department hurled at it for most of our summer, but it's also got Ben Whishaw, Romola Garai and Dominic West and, perhaps even more crucially, that grand kind of selection of supporting actors \u2013 the likes of Chancellor, Tim Pigott-Smith, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Juliet Stevenson \u2013 which lets you know you're in for intrigue and quality. It's already being hailed, if not exactly sold as this by the corporation, as our answer to Mad Men. Certainly, the suits are proper suits, everyone smokes all the time and a successful broadcast is celebrated by whiskies all round in chipped coffee mugs, as opposed to today's granola bar and Pilates session. But it is also, unlike the American delight, much more redolent of a specific era, a really rather austere, moralistic yet hypocritical and precise actual year in the mid-50s as Britain struggled with such varying quandaries as the end of capital punishment, introduction of smokeless coal, immigration and the end of empire. (the Observer itself, and its outspoken Suez leader of the time, plays a vital part in a later episode.) It is also in the business of questioning whether news programmes should be honest and probing, or still deferential, and asking what was happening to the old country and what was happening to women. The last is particularly intriguing. Characters of the strength of Garai's and Chancellor's still have to prove everything 10 times over while being stereotyped as \"Moneypennys\", when today they'd be running the damned corporation, but in 1956 you can tell they're beginning actually to dare to know this. And it'll be another triumph for the (current) Beeb, and Dominic West, and surely Ben Whishaw, but it should surely also be time officially to garland its creator. Not that Abi Morgan is unknown. Ask any playwright, read any of their interviews over the last decade about current talent, and her name almost always crops up in the same sentence as those of Paul Abbott, Tony Marchant, Andrew Davies and Jimmy McGovern. The rest of us will surely know the work, if not \u2013 or not yet \u2013 the name. Most recently, perhaps, from last year's Royal Wedding, an acclaimed retrospective, filmed in a Welsh village, contrasting the real Charles and Di nuptials with actual life in those early 1980s, though Morgan has said that there was a \"sweetness to this film which is unusual for me\". More layered, certainly, was her adaptation for the screen of Monica Ali's Brick Lane \u2013 another critical triumph. Morgan hadn't actually read the novel when asked to adapt it. \"But everybody had seen the reviews and felt they had an opinion about it and so I said, 'Oh yes, wonderful book!' In a way, my naivety was quite lucky. It saved me, because it is huge and daunting.\" Abi Morgan read the book, did a deeply subtle adaptation which worked, and saw it come out in the maelstrom of controversy. Some Brick Lane Bengalis, who later admitted not having even read the book, called it and its filming \"defamatory\"; the ignorance-stuffed kerfuffle was still enough to have its royal film performance cancelled by wary royals. Less controversial, but equally correctly garlanded, was her 2006 TV film Tsunami, recreating, through a mesh of individual stories, the impact of the 2004 Boxing Day devastation of Thailand and Sri Lanka. She had spent vast amounts of time researching real stories in Thailand. The subject was searingly well served by, again, a to-die-for cast (Toni Collette, Sophie Okonedo). \"Television [as opposed to film] is much more immediate,\" Morgan said. \"You can react quickly to events and be quietly political and quite explosive. The writer is really the author of the piece, whereas film is a director's medium: you organise the party, but you don't go to it yourself.\" Even if you'd missed these, there are few who can forget Sex Traffic, the 2004 TV drama serial which stormed to eight Baftas. Or White Girl. Or, if you're more of a theatregoer, the Olivier nominee Tender or its complex and equally lauded Splendour. It is hard swiftly to categorise Morgan's ways \u2013 a little bit feminist, a little bit pro-underdog, more than a little bit of constantly surprising, overwhelmingly fine writing. A tiny bit easier, perhaps, to tell what she's drawn to. On the one side, there's the hugeness of an event or period: Suez, tsunami, the gut-horror of sex trafficking in the early 90s. She writes, she has said, to put order in her life. \"Chaos is my natural habitat. I write about chaotic situations and about people finding their way through the chaos, the hope that you can find your way.\" But there's also an individual writer, TV writer, playwright, drawn to re-exploration, as so many are, of those decades which shape us. For Abi Morgan, now in her early 40s, it was of course the 80s, hence perhaps the unlikely personal sweetnesses of Royal Wedding. \"I really got into the royal wedding then. But did I want to be the princess? No, I don't think so. I was a pretty heartbroken 13-year-old. That was the year my grandmother died and my parents split up.\" Her (now late) father was a director, her mother, Pat, is still an actress \u2013 perhaps last seen in the Specsavers rollercoaster ad. \"The royal wedding was this wonderful day for the whole country and yet I was living in a flat stripped of furniture because my father had taken it all. I'd lost a dad and yet for that day I was buying into the concept: 'Your prince will come too.'\" Morgan's Edinburgh hits, particularly Tender, reflected her personal life more than her recent work, but perhaps, and perhaps obviously, that's what happens when you finally meet someone and have babies, as she now has with husband Jake. At the end of this year comes her next absolute opus, The Iron Lady, starring Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher and already mired in controversy \u2013 wasn't Brick Lane a nice learning curve? It's almost the perfect Abi Morgan subject: chaos, globalism, tiny personal stories, but with an absolute need for narrative and all set to a decade she knows. Of the baroness, she has only said: \"If there was one thing I admired about Maggie it was her certainty. But that was also what I disliked about her.\" It could be her Peter \"The Queen\" Morgan moment, lifting this supreme writer, with equal understanding of both stagecraft and televisual narrative need, to the status of urgent chronicler of our ages. It's tempting to wonder how she would have \u2013 will? \u2013 dramatise the week just past. She was once asked her golden rule of writing. \"Don't talk about it, do it. People often talk out an idea because it's a way of getting feedback but you're much better just sitting down and trying to write it, really.\" If she had any time left, to gaze at this past week and with her love for TV's immediacy, I do wish she would."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
