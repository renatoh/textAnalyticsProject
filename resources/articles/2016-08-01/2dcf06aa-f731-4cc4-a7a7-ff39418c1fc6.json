The TEF aims to link tuition fee rises to an assessment of teaching quality according to questionable metrics. This will have severe ramifications, entrenching inequality between higher education providers and contradicting the government\u2019s ambitions around widening participation. The government already turned maintenance grants and NHS bursaries into loans and curtailed the disabled students\u2019 allowance. These policies leave the poorest students with more than \u00a353,000 debt after three years\u2019 undergraduate study. If the TEF is implemented, fees could reach \u00a311,697 by 2025-26. Debt aversion disproportionately affects groups already facing barriers to education: the participation rate increase for the poorest students has stagnated and 18-year-olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds are 2.4 times less likely to apply. The government proposes that the TEF uses employment and salary outcomes six months post-graduation, alongside National Student Survey scores \u2013 a limited measure of satisfaction, not quality. Instead, we advocate a partnership between students and staff, to form better means of assessing and enhancing quality. The TEF is part of the most significant shakeup of higher education in decades and it is vital that our vice-chancellors add their voices to the debate.
