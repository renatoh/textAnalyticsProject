Frontrunners include a Thai couple, George and Apple Kosit, of a salon in Peckham, south London. Wang and Currie interview them together and they start reminiscing about how they met like the faux-real interviewees in When Harry Met Sally. In its unpretentious way, this film has something to say about creativity and entrepreneurialism in modern Britain, and it's impossible to watch it without a smile on your face."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
