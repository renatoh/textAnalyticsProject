The Seattle-based chain tonight revealed a 70% slump in quarterly profits to $64.3m and announced that it intends to shed 6,700 employees this year. It is closing 300 stores, two thirds of which will be in the US, on top of 660 shutdowns last year. As the global economy turns sour, appetite for Starbucks' premium-priced drinks appears to be waning. Like-for-like sales fell by 10% at American stores and dropped by 3% elsewhere in the world - including a decline in the UK during the three months to December. Starbucks' chief executive, Howard Schultz, is joining in the belt-tightening by asking the company's board to cut his basic salary from $1.2m to $10,000. Schultz, 55, dropped off Forbes' list of the world's billionaires last year as the value of his stake in Starbucks plunged. In a statement, Schultz blamed the \"weakening global consumer environment\" for Starbucks' problems. He said the company was following a \"well developed plan to strengthen our business through more efficient operations and by preserving the fundamental strengths and values of our brand\". Starbucks' share dropped 2.5% in after-hours trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The architect of Starbucks' growth during the 1980s and 1990s, Schultz returned as chief executive a year ago to try reignite flagging momentum. He has made a series of changes including improving customer loyalty cards, reviving in-store coffee grinding and axing hot sandwiches which obscure the aroma of coffee in stores. In another money-saving ruse reported this week, Starbucks' US stores will stop brewing decaffeinated coffee during the afternoons unless a customer specifically asks for it. Analysts say Starbucks' market has been eroded by improved coffee offerings at fast-food stores such as McDonald's which typically charge much lower prices. Starbucks has 16,875 stores globally. It once boasted of an ambition to have 20,000 outlets in the US and a further 20,000 overseas, although expansion plans have since been radically scaled back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
