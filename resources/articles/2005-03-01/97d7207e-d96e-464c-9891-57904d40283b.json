Cresswell, who came to prominence following a successful spell at Sheffield Wednesday, powered an unstoppable overhead kick past Paddy Kenny in the United goal three minutes after the interval to cancel out an earlier effort from Leigh Bromby. It was no more than Preston deserved and help maintain an impressive run of form for Billy Davies's side, who have now lost just once in the last 14 games. Warnock's side, on the other hand, are becoming specialists at flattering to deceive. They may have become FA Cup specialists in recent seasons but their league form leaves much to be desired. United are fast running out of time to stake their claim for a place in the top six. In contrast, Preston have enjoyed a flourishing run of form at the right time to stake their own claim for promotion, although it was the home side that looked more capable of breaking the stalemate here tonight. Bromby was inches away from nudging home Phil Jagielka's wicked cross inside the first five minutes, while moments later Steve Kabba saw his shot deflected inches wide of Chris Day's right hand post. United, however, were grateful to Paddy Kenny for keeping the scores level on 20 minutes when he produced a stunning save low down to his left to palm away a fierce drive from Paul McKenna. Bromby gave United the lead when he produced an emphatic finish on 31 minutes after Jon Harley's corner had swept through a crowded goalmouth and evaded Brian O'Neill before landing at the feet of the defender. Harley's looping shot then deflected on to the crossbar shortly before the interval. Whatever Billy Davies said in his half time team-talk appeared to have the desired effect as Preston equalised within three minutes of the re-start. Preston came close to taking the lead moments later when David Nugent raced clear on goal but he was denied by another impressive save from Kenny. Michael Tonge tried to lift the Blades' spirits with a jinxing run into the Preston penalty area but his skidding drive was well held at his near post by Chris Day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
