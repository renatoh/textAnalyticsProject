This is Gordon Brown's hook for publishing the final report of the Leitch Review of skills. Yet tomorrow is not the end-game - it is but the beginning. Tomorrow a batch of Treasury commissioned reports will be published by the chancellor, of which Lord Leitch's review is just one. The purpose of these reports is clear - to feed into the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review next July. In the same vein as the expected reports on transport, planning, science and innovation, the publication of the final Leitch report tomorrow will be followed by intense consultation and consensus building. Led by the Department for Education and Skills, the results will feed into the 2007 spending review. But look at the big picture. That shows there are two strands of education and training policy feeding into the spending review. The first concerns everyone up to the age of 19, and the second covers adult skills, welfare to work and higher education. Long-term education and training policy for 0- to 19-year-olds is being shaped by a Treasury review of services to children and young people, and the Treasury-commissioned Lyons Review of the functions and finance of local government. The period leading up to next July's review provides an opportunity to debate how best to close the funding gap between state and private schools. That will include hiking up 16-18 further education funding to match higher levels of sixth-form funding. It also provides a chance to think through the advantages and disadvantages of introducing a statutory \"learning leaving age\" of 18, which could cost an extra \u00a31bn per year for tuition and training, more, if child benefit, child tax credit and education maintenance allowances are included. This would also need new employment legislation to rule out jobs without recognised training. And even if the Leitch Review leaves the structure of the Learning and Skills Council alone, the feeding in of the Lyons Review of local government funding to the spending review could re-ignite the debate over transferring 16-19 LSC funding to local authorities. In the context of next year's spending review, the Leitch Review is only one influence, albeit important, on long-term policy development in adult skills, welfare to work and higher education. The Treasury review of mental health outcomes, for instance, links the debate between adult skills and welfare to work. More important, perhaps, is the Treasury review of sub-national interventions in economic development. On the one hand, the review is a focal point for the debate on creating Regional Development Agencies mark II and devolving more powers to local authorities. On the other, it provides an opportunity for debating the role of elected local authorities and elected city mayors in relation to adult LSC funding. This still leaves higher education. Despite developments around vocational sub-degrees, professional courses demanded by employers, degree-awarding powers of FE colleges and the role of universities in science and innovation, mainstream HE appears more remote from the spending review. Presumably, the chancellor is content to park this issue until the planned 2009 HE funding review, by which time he might be Labour leader and a general election may have already taken place. Certainly, the promise of something big on adult skills in the final Leitch Report stems from the publication of his interim report a year ago. The UK has a large skills problem which will worsen by 2020, and, left unsolved, will have dire consequences for economic prosperity and social justice. Big problems deserve big solutions. FE and the skills community will look forward to discussing the ideas proposed by Leitch on adult skills. But probably the main message to emerge in the build-up to next year's spending review is that Labour's priority in education and training for a fourth term is children and young people.
