Jump racing is acknowledged to be in desperate need of a headline horse right now to carry its publicity standard. But Lewis makes no apologies for his determination to ensure the fast and fluent seven-year-old is given every chance to become the first chaser in 30 years to emulate the great L'Escargot and retain the game's premier crown next March at Cheltenham. But after that, the owner promises, Best Mate will strut his stuff for his legion of fans. \"I hope they can be patient,\" Lewis said. \"His trainer Henrietta Knight and I believe that this year particularly we should take good care of him because it would be wonderful to go for a second Gold Cup in March. \"Maybe we are being a trifle overcautious but we have agreed to run him in the Peterborough Chase [on Saturday] and then, if all is well, in the King George at Kempton [on Boxing Day], culminating in the Gold Cup at the Festival. \"On the other hand, we know he is a popular horse and it would be nice if his supporters saw him more often. \"Once we get to Cheltenham, God willing, the tactics may change completely after that and everyone will be able to see what an exciting horse he is.\" At Huntingdon Best Mate is due to defend national honour against Douze Douze, handled by the canny French trainer Guillaume Macaire, who rates him as the most talented horse he has ever had. The plan is for Douze Douze to go on to the King George but not the Gold Cup, as he does not like going left-handed \u00e0 la Cheltenham. Lewis has had his spies out in France and rates both horse and trainer. Douze Douze won the \u00a3120,000 Prix Maurice Gillois at Auteuil at the back end of 2000 only to pick up a leg injury that kept him out for a couple of years. He recently resurfaced in a hurdle race in the provinces at Cholet, which he won in fine style. \"I know a little bit about him,\" said Lewis sagely. \"I know he is a very good horse that is on the way back - and you would have to say Monsieur Macaire is no slouch. \"I have a strong connection with the Le Metayer family over there, who are breeders and the French representatives on Tattersalls over here. Pierre Charles Metayer, the father of the family, who sadly died a couple of years ago, found me most of my good French horses, such as Edredon Bleu and Impek. And, ironically, Best Mate's sire Un Desperado and his dam Katday were both French-bred.\" The other Saturday highlight, the Grade Two Ascot Hurdle, was reopened yesterday after only five horses were declared at the initial stage. It now has a field of eight with the addition of Marble Arch, The Villager and Carlovent. Baracouda, from the Chan tilly stable of Fran\u00e7ois Doumen, is looking for his tenth straight win but a good run from Champion Hurdle runner-up Marble Arch will see his current 33-1 odds for next March's Cheltenham renewal come tumbling down. \u00b7 The scheduled meeting at Hexham tomorrow has been abandoned as the course is waterlogged."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
