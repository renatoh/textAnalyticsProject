To be fair, it wasn't a game of real quality, but we got the result. That's eight games without conceding at home now which just shows you how bad we've been away from Selhurst Park. United had quite a bit of possession in the opening 15 minutes but Palace, through a Darren Ambrose free-kick, came close to taking the lead. The second half was pretty scrappy but Ambrose's half-volley this time found the net to seal the win. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Our new singing Kagisho Dikgacoi made a good debut. Paddy McCarthy and Anthony Gardner had another good game at the back. Peter Guntrip, Holmesdale.net Ipswich Town 1-1 Hull City Was it a good match? A cracking game but a frustrating result. After our first-half performance we thought we should have scored more goals: we dominated and had a succession of corners. We also had some cracking efforts from distance and, although we saw a great goal from Jason Scotland, Hull put us under pressure and deserved a point. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Scotland did well in a difficult lone front man role but the debutant Andy Drury was very composed; showed good skills and looked every bit a Championship player. Lee Martin was lively out wide. Julian Watkins, TractorBoys.com Leeds United 2-2 Norwich City Was it a good match? It was a good game from start to finish \u2013 both sides tried to play football. Norwich were particularly good on the counterattack and pushed bodies forward. Leeds were on top in the first half and could have been 3\u20110 up at the break had they taken their chances, but Norwich scored just before the whistle. The visitors continued to press in the second half but both sides created an even number of chances. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Robert Snodgrass and Max Gradel were outstanding out wide. Jonny Howson did well in midfield. Davide Somma scored with his first touch. Adam Ternent, moTForum.com Millwall 2-3 Middlesbrough Was it a good match? I'm really gutted. It's so dejecting to play so well and take nothing from the game. Terrible officiating has cost us. I don't see how the linesman got it so wrong for their second goal. Their first was a really good free-kick but our equaliser was just as impressive. I think Hameur Bouazza's effort was closer to goal, though. A lack of communication at the back allowed Boro to score their winner. We had a few chances to equalise. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Liam Trotter played really well, particularly in the first half. Charlie Mahoney, Observer reader Nottingham Forest 2-1 Cardiff City Was it a good match? We're still unbeaten at home since 2009. It was a very exciting game, end-to-end for pretty much the whole 90 minutes. Cardiff definitely came to attack, but that was probably down to the fact they were poor at defending. But we were equally good going forward and played some really nice football. The major down side of the game was the referee, who got many decisions wrong, including a penalty that never was. Who played well/who had a nightmare? I was disappointed by Jay Bothroyd, whose dives went unnoticed by the referee. Rahoul Baruah, EighteenSixtyFive.co.uk Portsmouth 1-0 Barnsley Was it a good match? Everyone was pleased to get three points but the game was disappointing. For 80 minutes we didn't pass, control or cross the ball well. Barnsley looked a neater side but didn't threaten. We looked more dangerous and threatening after the introduction of Kanu. His goal was good, glancing an indirect free-kick past a helpless keeper, who previously had made two vital saves to keep them in it. David Nugent missed a virtually open goal to put the result beyond doubt. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Kanu changed the game, but Ricardo Rocha did well in defence. Mick Dunford, Pompey.org Preston North End 1-1 Queens Park Rangers Was it a good match? It was one of the worst games I'd ever seen for the opening 25 to 30 minutes. QPR scored and were just shading it. We visibly collapsed as our confidence drained out like a leaky petrol tank. Seriously, we were on the ropes. We were much better after the break and scored a sublime goal. Suddenly, someone filled the tank up with petrol again. The game was much improved and, to be honest, there isn't much difference between the top and bottom of this division. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Adel Taarabt is a frustrating so-and-so but was extremely dangerous throughout. Mark Holt, Observer reader Reading 1-1 Watford Was it a good match? First half they were woeful but Reading improved after the break. We're an average Championship side. Realistically I don't think we're going to make it into the play-offs so think we should start planning for next season \u2013 I don't think we'll go down. We've drawn 14 games this season, which just goes to show we can't score goals. We need a striker who can score more than just tap-ins. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Mikele Leigertwood distributed the ball perfectly. Matt Mills forgot he was a footballer and nearly cost us three or four goals. Ian Frampton, Observer reader Scunthorpe United 0-0 Derby County Was it a good match? It was a tight, edgy affair. Both sides gave it their all but lacked quality. The pitch, unfortunately, was atrocious and prevented both teams from playing the kind of football they wanted. A draw was probably a fair result as we edged a half of the game each. Derby are an average Championship side. I don't think they'll go down but will finish mid-table, at best. Who played well/who had a nightmare? For Derby, I thought Jamie Ward looked a handful \u2013 when he got the service he used the ball well. For Scunthorpe, the back four was as solid as ever \u2013 their second clean sheet on the bounce. Max Bell, Scunthorpe.Vitalfootball.co.uk Swansea City 3-0 Doncaster Rovers Was it a good match? It was a straightforward, comfortable win against an injury-struck Doncaster side who travelled with only 16 players. Swansea controlled the game after taking an early lead. On another day we might have scored more goals against a team who gave us far too much space. Doncaster will probably just escape the drop after picking up points earlier on in the season, but they're on a really bad run. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Ashley Williams put some good long-range passes together, while Nathan Dyer created many of our attacks.
