And that's footballers. However, while I understand if you can't find any spare worry in your heart for an imminent tidal wave of mock-Tudor repossessions, think of the others who would suffer, of the trickle-down effect. Think what a downturn in the finances of football personalities could do to sports car manufacturers, Harley Street knee specialists and avant-garde hairdressers. The profligate wedding industry might also go into freefall. Actually, it's not just footballers who should be worried. Prodigies in any sport are the least likely people in the world - apart from credulous pop ing\u00e9nues - to keep track of their own finances. There are, even now, hundreds of them working out in gyms across the land, thinking that the credit crunch is something they should be adding to their abs routine. Nor are sport's governing bodies often lauded for their wise fiscal management. It is important that sport considers how it can tighten its belt in these straitened times, so I have begun my own root-and-branch review of our national sports. I have discovered that there is a huge potential for saving. Rugby, I notice, has already made some attempts at husbandry. The players are doing their bit by having their shirts made out of less and less material. Clearly, the Guinness Premiership has adopted the great Tesco wisdom that every little helps. But frankly, any sport that employs 30 men on the pitch when our other leading brands make do with 22 is just indulgent. And ask yourself this: can we really afford two codes right now? Any management consultant could tell you that having both league and union is an unnecessary duplication. Mergers are the best way for institutions to weather turbulent times - and half the rugby union world is trying to play more like the league fellas anyway. Football has a particularly tough time economising because, as every manager and agent knows, it is crucial to the running of a club that the wage bill is never reduced. As Ashley \"I nearly crashed my car\" Cole will attest, it can be near-fatal for a player to hear of an impending pay cut. The poor man must now be in mortal danger every time he answers the phone to his stockbroker. Charlton Athletic had the right idea when they were relegated from the Premier League in 2007 and needed to find \u00a3250,000 in savings - instead of taking it out of their \u00a316.5m sale of Darren Bent, they scrapped their women's team. There are always better places to save money than a player's wage packet. Here are just a few: youth academies (Poles are cheaper); kiddie mascots (too expensive to keep in orange squash); and loo roll (people can wait until they get home). Cricket is the sport I really worry about, however. After all, Sir Allen Stanford, whose enterprising Twenty20 winner-takes-all game is due to take place in the Caribbean in five weeks' time, came to Lord's earlier in the year to literally flash his cash (all $20m of it) in front of a hungry-eyed establishment. But what will happen if cricket's powers that be discover that Stanford's jackpot has been loss-adjusted to \u00a3318, a time-share in the Canaries and a Braun blender? Cricket is rather too willing to believe that it has found a goose that lays golden eggs, gets them signed by the 1966 World Cup squad and makes a killing on eBay. Some timely home economics lessons are in order. The good news is, I've found them one immediate saving. Booking Atomic Kitten for mid-innings entertainment is an unnecessary extravagance - the England captain's wife will sing for free. Finally, there is no better place for sport to start cutting back than on its stadiums, which are the financial equivalents of black holes, sucking in money and resources in return for a once-weekly burp of light and activity. If Hoy, Wiggins, Pendleton and co attached dynamos to their bikes, the Manchester Velodrome would halve its electricity bill at a stroke. Consider, too, the Lawn Tennis Association's \u00a330m centre at Roehampton: some of the lushest green space in south-west London, dedicated to the purpose of nurturing young prodigies. Until it actually starts to do that, it could serve part-time as a lovely market garden. And here's the biggest money-saver of all: maybe the London 2012 committee (currently planning to spend \u00a39.3bn) could stop splashing out on building new venues and start using ones that already exist? I know, I know. Now I'm just being silly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
