When I leave at the end of visiting-hours a small, tidy man is sitting by the door: stick, well-knotted tie, watch-chain, tweed jacket. He gets to his feet, raises his hat and enquires: 'Excuse my troubling you, but would you be going anywhere near a railway station?' The young smiling nurse bends over him, and takes him by the elbow, saying: 'Maybe tomorrow, James. Maybe tomorrow we'll take you to the station.' \u00b7 From Outliving by Bernard O'Donoghue, published by Chatto &amp; Windus.
