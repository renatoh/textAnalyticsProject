They paid a large deposit before moving in and took great care of the property during their occupancy. They vacated the property on April 2 and are still waiting for their deposit. Although the agent was paid a handling fee, it says we must contact the landlady, who is currently abroad. We questioned items on the inventory checking-out list but the whole system seems pretty well protected against challenges. We still do not know how much of the deposit will be refused as a result of this inventory expense. I am not quite sure where to turn for help. LM A You don't make it clear whether the problem with the inventory is connected to the delay in repaying your deposit. It seems odd, however, that you're being directed to the landlady for payment as generally it is the agent who holds the deposit and the agent who is responsible for repaying it. This level of separation is one of the reasons why landlords use letting agents. Usually, deposits should be returned within 30 days of the tenant leaving the property, provided no rent is owed and there is no damage to the property. But without knowing the specifics of your sons' tenancy agreement - did they break their contract early? What sort of charge is being made against their deposit on the basis of the checking-out inventory? - I can't really advise as to whether an unreasonable amount of time has elapsed here. If your agent is a member of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, you could contact the association for advice as it has a code of conduct to which all members must adhere. Otherwise, have a local Citizens' Advice Bureau adviser look over your sons' tenancy contract to see if it has been breached and whether the inventory charge is reasonable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
