The project, called Predict, had been run by the US Agency for International Development since 2009. It had identified more than 160 different coronaviruses that had the potential to develop into pandemics, including a virus that is considered the closest known relative to Covid-19. A decision to wind down the program was made, however, in September, just three months before the first reports of people becoming infected with Covid-19 in Wuhan, China. The end of the program saw the departure of dozens of scientists and analysts working to identify potential pandemics in countries around the world, including China. \u201cIt was a genius, visionary program that USAid took a big risk to fund and it\u2019s a crying shame it was canceled,\u201d said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit specialist in tackling wildlife-borne disease that was one of the major partners in the program. Daszak said he did not know why the initiative was scrapped or if the White House played any direct role in its ending. EcoHealth Alliance has been given a temporary extension to work on the program but the role will finally come to a close in September. The news about Predict\u2019s demise was first reported in the Los Angeles Times. Predict\u2019s work focused on the dangers of viruses spreading from wildlife to humans and causing possible pandemics like the Covid-19 outbreak that has resulted in much of the world grinding to a halt. It is suspected that Covid-19 made the leap to humans from a bat sold at a Wuhan market. Daszak said there are an estimated 1.7m mystery viruses in wildlife that may have the potential to transfer to humans and cause another pandemic, making the early detection of these diseases imperative for public health and economic reasons. \u201cWe should\u2019ve been more unsettled about this before all this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got a lot of flak for spending money in other countries but just think how much even a few billion would be worth to stop this sort of pandemic. It\u2019s sad to see the project finish because it\u2019s the way of the future, in 50 years they will be bog-standard. \u201cI\u2019m not confident we will learn the lessons from this, though. We saw the same thing happen after Ebola and then Zika. We are always behind with pandemics, we are flying blind. We have hit the snooze button several times and now here\u2019s the big one.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether a continuation of the project would have dampened the current pandemic, although the Trump administration has faced criticism for its preparation before the outbreak. The administration reduced a team working in China on pandemics and has repeatedly attempted to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A spokesman for USAid told the Los Angeles Times that the Predict program was \u201cjust one component of USAid\u2019s global health security efforts and accounted for less than 20% of our global health security funding\u201d. A new initiative to help prevent the spread of diseases from animals to humans is due to start later this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
