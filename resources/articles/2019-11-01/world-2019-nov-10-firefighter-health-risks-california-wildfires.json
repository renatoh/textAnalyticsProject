Black, murky smoke had disappeared entire streets in and near the small California town of Paradise. \u201cIt was daytime but you thought it was night,\u201d he said. Pierce, who has been fighting wildland fires for 28 years, knows how to navigate around smoke. \u201cYou have to find pockets of clean air,\u201d he said, \u201cand keep going until you can\u2019t any more.\u201d Pierce has used this technique at the Camp fire, the Carr fire before that, and the Kincade fire he\u2019s been battling in the past weeks. He knows that the toxic vapors can stick in his system long after the flames have died down and the adrenaline has faded. Over the past decade, scientists have been working to better understand how firefighters\u2019 exposure to smoke and chemical vapors affects their long-term health. In California, the researchers\u2019 work has taken on a new urgency as increasingly ferocious fires burn through wilderness and development alike, unleashing unprecedented amounts of gases and particulate upon those battling the blazes. \u201cWe know that firefighters have pretty intense exposures under those conditions,\u201d said Rachel Morello-Frosch, an environmental scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. An analysis she released in July found that firefighters who fought the October 2017 Tubbs fire, which raged for more than three weeks through nearly 37,000 acres in California\u2019s wine country and killed 22, came home with heightened levels of mercury and other toxic chemicals in their blood. Blood samples from 149 firefighters deployed to Tubbs showed higher rates of mercury compared not only with members of the general public, but also with other firefighters who weren\u2019t deployed. \u201cThis was just an initial, pilot study,\u201d Morello-Frosch said. Still, it seemed to validate what many firefighters already suspected: those working in regions referred to as wildland-urban interface, where residential areas blend into wilderness, face elevated health risks. Risks of firefighting are changing Wildland firefighters are often exposed to smoke for longer periods of time, working 40-, 50- or 60-hour shifts, even camping and sleeping amid the fumes. \u201cThey\u2019re doing backbreaking work,\u201d said Morello-Frosch, digging lines, trimming trees and hiking for miles. They tend to wear relatively lightweight gear so they can stay nimble. Whereas the responders running into burning buildings wear heavy-duty masks that feed them clean air, wildland firefighters might use a handkerchief. And a simple handkerchief might do, if all that was burning was vegetation. \u201cBut the dynamics of wildfire have changed,\u201d said Matt Alba, a fire captain who led his San Francisco-based strike team to the Camp fire last year. As communities have built and expanded into the wild areas, \u201cit\u2019s not just plants and leaves burning, it\u2019s homes and structures too,\u201d Alba said. Paradise didn\u2019t smell like wildfire smoke, he recalled. \u201cThere was this awful taste to it. We just knew it was wrong.\u201d His crew fought through stinging eyes and headaches. Many of the houses in Paradise were prefabricated, and when they burned so did a noxious mix of plastics, metals, household cleaning chemicals and who knows what else. \u201cThere were charred piles of just open cans, and lots of burned out cars,\u201d he said \u2013 some with bodies in them. \u201cIt was apocalyptic.\u201d Afterward, he said, \u201cwe got all new boots, because ours were just covered in a lot of toxic content.\u201d Scientists still don\u2019t know what exactly that \u201ccontent\u201d contains \u2013 and how toxic it may be. \u201cThat\u2019s always the 50-million-dollar question,\u201d said Morello-Frosch. Fumes from anything and everything that burns have the potential to cause harm, but so do PFAS \u2013 a controversial class of chemicals used in firefighters\u2019 turnout gear \u2013 and so does the neon-pink fire retardant that responders blanket over blazes, she said. Does firefighting cause cancer? Researchers are working to understand how exposure to a noxious cocktail of fumes and particulate will affect firefighters\u2019 bodies. Several studies have established that urban firefighters have higher rates of cancer than the general population. A study of nearly 30,000 firefighters from 1950-2009 by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found that those who fight urban fires have higher rates of certain types of cancers \u2013 including digestive, lung, throat, and urinary cancers. It also found that firefighters experience 14% more cancer deaths than the general public. Federal researchers are encouraging firefighters across the nation to register for the largest-to-date study of firefighters and cancer. They\u2019re also looking into whether firefighters\u2019 work affects their risk for heart disease. In the meantime, groups like the San Francisco Firefighters Cancer Prevention Foundation (SFFCPF) are campaigning to phase out the use of PFAS chemicals and develop better, lightweight protective equipment. \u201cWhen I entered the SF fire department in 1974, we didn\u2019t really consider cancer a major cause of death,\u201d said Toni Stefani, the president of the SFFCPF. Back then, he saw young, seemingly healthy friends and colleagues succumbing to cancer. \u201cWe were going to funerals all the time for a lot of the retired firefighters,\u201d he said. Stefani himself was only 49 when he was diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma in 2001. The problem hasn\u2019t gone away. \u201cEven now, the numbers keep piling up,\u201d he said. But fire departments are a lot more careful now. \u201cHopefully, as we learn more, we can develop new standard operating procedures that\u2019ll better protect these men and women,\u201d he said. In Santa Rosa, California, after toiling to beat back the Kincade fire for days, Jeremy Pierce said he was aware of these local and national conversations about the physical toll of the job. He\u2019s taken precautions: he tries to keep himself and his crew upwind of smoke while working. Afterward, he makes sure to clean off, the best he can, before going back home. \u201cI don\u2019t want to expose my family to anything toxic,\u201d he said. Otherwise, he accepts the risks of the job. \u201cYou know, nobody gets out of this profession without some damage along the way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t a firefighter around who doesn\u2019t have that drive to help people despite everything.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2019 because an earlier version incorrectly said that \u201cmost of the houses in Paradise were prefabricated\u201d. The position is that many of the houses were prefabricated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
