But there\u2019s not much excitement on Wall Street. The Dow Jones ended the day up a meagre 11 points, or 0.04% (squint and you miss it), while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq fell around 0.2% each. With the Iranian sanctions applied, investors are now hoping for a breakthrough in the US-China trade war later this week, when G20 leaders gather. In the meantime, Trump\u2019s accusation of incompetence at the Federal Reserve hasn\u2019t dampened expectations of a Fed rate cut in July (if only to quieten the White House for a bit). Goodnight! GW Some experts are suggesting that America\u2019s new sanctions on Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and eight senior military commanders are more symbolic than practical. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take: The penalties won\u2019t have a significant impact on a country that\u2019s already in recession and facing heavy sanctions from the U.S. Still, the new restrictions serve as symbolic reprimand for the attacks, according to former Treasury officials. \u201cIt will have an effect because it will annoy the Iranians and make negotiations hard to pull off if the supreme leader is sanctioned,\u201d said Brian O\u2019Toole, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who previously worked in the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions unit. Donald Trump\u2019s attack on the \u201cstubborn, childish\u201d Federal Reserve is weighing on the US dollar. The greenback has dropped by 0.2% against a basket of currencies, nudging the euro up to $1.139. Investors may feel the president\u2019s criticism will force Fed policymakers to cut interest rates more than once in the coming months, to avoid further tweetblasts. The oil price has dipped back in late trading - perhaps traders are relieved that America has only hit Iran with sanctions, not military action. Brent crude (sourced from the North Sea) is down 0.9% at $64.64 per barrel). US crude is flat at $57.50 per barrel. Here\u2019s the executive order against Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and those in his office. Plus the moment it was signed: Wall Street is taking the new Iranian sanctions in its stride. The Dow is still positive, up 48 points at 26,767 points, as New York traders grab lunch. President Trump has now signed an executive order in the Oval Office that he said will deny Iran\u2019s supreme leader and others access to financial instruments. Trump told reporters: \u201cWe do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country. I can only tell you we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon. The comes a few days after Iran shot down a US drone. The president played down the link, saying fresh sanctions were coming already, but added: \u201cI think a lot of restraint has been shown by us but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to show it in the future.\u201d It\u2019s official: America is imposing new sanctions on Iran, which target Tehran\u2019s supreme leader, and top officials. Mark Knoller of CBS has the details: In the City, the FTSE 100 index of top blue-chip shares has closed just 9 points higher at 7,416. It was a largely subdued day, with the weak German business confidence data hitting sentiment. More (sceptical) reaction: A quick recap: President Donald Trump has fired another salvo of criticism at America\u2019s central bankers, claiming they have damaged stock prices and economic growth. In a twitter flurry, Trump claimed the Federal Reserve \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing\u201d and raised interest rates too quickly. Comparing the Fed to a \u201cstubborn child\u201d (?!) for not cutting borrowing costs by now, Trump tweeted: \u201cThink of what it could have been if the Fed had gotten it right.\u201d Trump also hinted that America could withdraw military support from the Gulf region, claiming that China and Japan should take a bigger lead in protecting oil shipments in the area. The comments came as oil prices hit three-week highs, as investors braced for new US sanctions on Iran. Trump\u2019s Iranian ambassador has now weighed in, suggesting an international \u201ctanker protection force\u201d in the wake of recent Gulf attacks. This is helping to pull crude prices lower -- Brent is back below $65 per barrel. Bitcoin has also been surging, hitting a 15-month high over $11,000 overnight. Experts say Facebook\u2019s new Libra currency is reigniting interest in cryptocoins. German business confidence, though, has hit its lowest level in four years - signalling weakness in the euro area. Donald Trump\u2019s attack on the Federal Reserve today is just the \u201clatest diatribe\u201d in \u201clong-running attack\u201d against the central bank So warns the Financial Times: He has over the past year called the central bank his \u201cbiggest threat\u201d and said he was \u201cnot even a little bit happy\u201d with chairman Jay Powell. Earlier this month, he said the Fed was being \u201cvery, very disruptive\u201d by raising interest rates too fast and giving China an edge in trade negotiations as a result. The criticism comes even after the Fed last week signalled a strong possibility of cutting rates this year and some central bank members argued for immediate action to cut them in order to counter weak growth momentum and inflation. Britain and America\u2019s stock markets remain \u201cblandly positive this Monday despite Trump\u2019s inflammatory remarks regarding both the Fed and the Strait of Hormuz\u201d, comments Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx. Donald Trump has also won a legal battle over his steel tariffs, although it\u2019s not the end of the matter. Supreme Court judges have turned down a challenge from US companies who said they were suffering higher prices and \u201congoing harm\u201d because of the tariff regime (which makes imports of steel more expensive). Associated Press has the details: The Supreme Court is rejecting an early challenge to President Donald Trump\u2019s authority to impose tariffs on imported steel based on national security concerns. The justices did not comment on Monday in leaving in place a decision by the Court of International Trade that ruled against steel importers and other users of imported steel who challenged the 25% tariff on steel that Trump imposed in 2018. The importers argue that Trump does not have unbounded authority under the Constitution to regulate trade. They say that job belongs to Congress. The legal challenge is at an early stage, before a federal appeals court has weighed in. The case could return to the Supreme Court later. Donald Trump is right about one thing, though - this has been a vintage month for the stock market. The Dow Jones is up nearly 8% this month, which the president called \u201cone of the best\u201d June\u2019s in US history. It\u2019s actually the best in over 80 years, since June 1938, when the Dow surged by an astonishing 24.3%. This month\u2019s rally follows a torrid May, and was sparked by suggestions of US interest rate cuts and fresh stimulus in the eurozone. As Marketwatch puts it: The rally for equities has been partly supported by the Fed, which concluded its Wednesday rate-setting meeting by signaling a willingness too trim rates as soon as the end of the July 30-31 gathering to curb the effects of tariff clashes between the U.S. and international trade partners, notably China, that have roiled global economies and threaten to disrupt global supply chains. Ding ding! The New York stock market is open, and shares are rising despite geopolitical tensions in the Gulf. The Dow Jones industrial average (which tracks 30 of the biggest US companies) has gained 77 points or 0.3% in early trading to 26,796. That takes it closer to last year\u2019s record highs. The S&amp;P 500 (the broader stocks index) has gained just 1 point to 2,951 -- having hit its own record highs last week. Donald Trump\u2019s tweetstorm failed to address the fact that his trade dispute with China has been weighing on markets for some time. Rupert Thompson, head of research at Kingswood, points out that investors are hoping for a breakthrough at the G20 meeting of world leaders on Friday and Saturday. The meeting of Presidents Xi and Trump at the G20 gathering later this week will be critical. Most likely, Trump will back away to some extent from the sharp increase in tariffs planned for early July. But a full-blown trade deal looks very unlikely. With equities riding high, the pressure on Trump to reach an early deal has been reduced. In the meantime, hopes of US interest rate cuts are keeping markets buoyant, he adds. One of the president\u2019s top advisors, Kellyanne Conway, has been discussing Iran at the White House: Donald Trump is now turning his attention to America\u2019s central bankers, accusing them of incompetence. In another Twitter blast from the White House, Trump claims the Fed has hurt US growth by leaving interest rates too high. He claims GDP could be growing at up to 5% per year, not the 3.1% per year recorded in the first quarter of 2019. The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates in July, in response to slowing growth and weak inflation. That\u2019s unlikely to win them any plaudits from Trump, who has been banging the rate cut drum for months (and now looks vindicated). Does Donald Trump really want Chinese and Japanese warships cruising around the Persian Gulf? It\u2019s only recently they were engaged in cat-and-mouse manoeuvres around the Senkaku Islands..... Doug Saunders of the Globe and Mail points out that Japan\u2019s navy isn\u2019t allowed to head off into international action anyway. The Atlantic\u2019s David Frum also has concerns.... Bloomberg\u2019s Stephen Stapczynski is querying the president\u2019s math(s): Newsflash: President Trump has tweeted that America could withdraw its military protection from the Strait of Hormuz (the area where several tankers have been attacked in recent weeks). Trump wants China and Japan to step up and protect the ships passing through the Gulf, pointing out that they consume much of the oil. That may alarm the financial markets -- without US military protection, the Middle East waterways could become more dangerous. Donald Trump\u2019s clampdown on Iranian oil seems to be having some success. New figures show that Iran only exported 300,000 barrels per day this month, down from around 500,000 bpd in May. It had been shifting 2.5 million barrels per day last year, before the US sanctions kicked in. European stock markets have subsided into the red, after a generally quiet morning. The main indices are all down, as this morning\u2019s drop in German business confidence worries traders. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says investors are keeping their heads down until the G20 meeting later this week, where the presidents of China and the US will meet. All the attention will be on Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and whether they can dial down the mood music on trade which of late has been set at death metal levels. \u201cThe outcome could help set the tone for the markets over the remainder of the summer. Carsten Brzeski of ING has spotted that German business confidence has hit a four year low, according to this morning\u2019s IFO report. Business expectations have slumped, with company bosses expecting turbulence in the months ahead due to trade conflicts and a slowdown in America\u2019s economy. Brzeski writes: Fear of losing. This is the best summary of the current state of Germany\u2019s businesses. Germany\u2019s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, just dropped for the third month in a row, falling to the lowest level in more than four years. The Ifo index stood at 97.4 in June, from 97.9 in May. While the current assessment component actually increased, the expectations component fell back, close to its recent low at the beginning of the year. Once again, it is well-known uncertainties that are weighing on German business sentiment. Losing one mayoral race is a misfortune. Losing the same one twice is positively careless. That\u2019s where Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan finds himself this morning, after Turkey\u2019s opposition party dramatically won a rerun of the Istanbul mayoral election yesterday. This is the second time that the People\u2019s Republican party (CHP) has beaten Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling AKP party -- the initial result having been annulled. Losing twice (and by a wider margin the second time) is a big blow to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s authority. In response, Turkish assets are rallying today, sending its BIST 100 stock index up by 1.4%. The Turkish lira has also strengthened, along with bond prices. Ergodan has worried global investors in recent months, by undermining central bank independence and making his son-in-law the finance minister. The Istanbul defeat could trigger a re-shaping of Turkish politics, new mayor Ekrem Imamoglu being cited as a possible presidential rival. Environmental news: health and beauty chain Boots is banning plastic bags at its UK stores. Instead customers will get paper ones - at between 5p and 10p each, depending on size, as Boots joins the ranks of companies trying to restrict plastic waste. Bitcoin is still trading at its highest levels for 15 months, up nearly 1% today at $10,918. Some crypto-currency experts are predicting that bitcoin could keep rallying, having already doubled in value in the last seven weeks. Glen Goodman, author of The Crypto Traders, says: \u201cDespite this year\u2019s huge price rise, google searches for \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 are still a lot lower than they were during the last boom. This suggests the price has the potential to go far higher than its current level if the wider public becomes interested again. Though of course, it could be argued that lacking wider public involvement, the current price rise is simply down to blind optimism by the small crypto community who see it as their pain-free path to early retirement.\u201d After the recent parabolic rise, many traders will be looking to take some profits off the table now, but it\u2019s worth remembering that last time Bitcoin\u2019s price broke through $10,000, it then hit it\u2019s all time high of nearly $20,000 just 16 days later.\u201d Naeem Aslam of Think Markets also sees signs that bitcoin could rise sharply higher, as investors who have bet against bitcoin get their fingers burned. This is a strong comeback, everyone has been waiting for this for a long time. From a price perspective, bitcoin has recovered more than 50% off its losses from its all-time high of $20,000. The strong resurgence in the bitcoin price is mainly due to the renewed mainstreaming interest in crypto currencies and the technology which underlines it. Projects like Facebook\u2019s Libra has provided much needed tailwind for this space. I do think the next rally is going to be a lot more stronger than the previous one, one can call it a bubble, but this time the range could very well be between $60,000 to $100,000. However, Michael Hewson of CMC Markets is more sceptical - pointing out that Facebook\u2019s move into crypto-currencies is controversial: While some have lauded this move as a welcome attempt to disrupt the payments industry, having received the backing of Visa and Mastercard, there still remains the worry of what the company might do with users personal data, where Facebook has been on the receiving end of a backlash over how it uses the data it collects. This does raise the inevitable concern that if you\u2019re reluctant to share your personal data with Facebook, why on earth would you trust it with your money? This slump in German business confidence reinforces concerns that the global economy is faltering. This is spurring a rally in government bonds, as the markets anticipate lower growth and weaker inflation. The amount of sovereign debt trading above its face value is at record levels, suggesting investors are trying to protect capital rather than seeking earnings growth [Around $11 trillion of bonds are now on offer at negative yields, or interest rates] It\u2019s a worrying sign that a recession may be on the horizon, as the Wall Street Journal reports today: The collapse in bond yields since this spring has been stark, swift and global, prompting a rush to lock in low rates that few expected to see this deep into a decadelong economic expansion. But share price are also holding up, on hopes that central bankers will ease monetary policy and offer more \u2018easy money\u2019 to support growth, and asset prices. This is an unusual situation -- typically, shares and bonds should move in opposite directions. So, this correlation suggests markets are anticipating that central bankers will save the day again. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, say this may not happen. Bond markets appear to be signaling an economic slowdown, while equities suggest growth will continue in a low-inflation, \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario. These seemingly contradictory stories only make sense if the bond market is pricing preemptive Fed rate cuts and the equity market is pricing that this action will succeed in preventing a slowdown. Since 2009, the Fed has proven generally successful at pivoting the right way, but we are wary of positioning for perfection. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019 take on the decline in German business morale: A closely watched survey is showing that German business confidence has fallen to a near five-year low as managers\u2019 expectations for the coming six months have deteriorated. The Ifo institute said Monday that its monthly confidence index slipped to 97.4 points in June from 97.9 last month, in line with market expectations. The third straight monthly fall takes the index to its lowest since November 2014 and was entirely due to managers\u2019 waning views of future prospects. Their assessment of the current situation rose modestly from May. German growth forecasts have been cut repeatedly recently and the economy is expected to turn in a feeble performance in the second quarter after returning to growth in the winter. Ifo\u2019s survey is based on responses from some 9,000 firms. IFO president Clemens Fuest is discussing today\u2019s German business confidence figures on Bloomberg TV now. He says the US-China trade war, and the damage from the diesel emissions scandal, are both weighing on Germany\u2019s economy. Trade war and uncertainty over tariffs are one burden on the economy. It would help if there was an agreement [between the US and China], particularly on more reliable long-term rules on trade. Fuest also suggests Germany\u2019s government should cut the tax burden to boost growth, rather than rely on the European Central Bank to crank up its stimulus programme again. Germany should cut corporate and personal tax rates... I don\u2019t think monetary policy will save us. German business confidence has now fallen steadily since May, as this chart from IFO shows: Just in: German business morale has fallen, for the third month in a row. IFO, the Munich-based research group, has reported that its business climate index has dropped to 97.4, from 97.9 in May. Both manufacturers and service sector companies reported that the business climate has worsened in June. IFO warns that German companies have grown increasingly pessimistic about the coming months, which is a negative signal for the eurozone\u2019s prospects. Ifo president Clemens Fuest says: \u201cThe German economy is heading for the doldrums\u201d Here\u2019s some early reaction: However... Germany\u2019s stock market is underperforming the rest of Europe, down around 0.25%. Carmakers are dragging the DAX index down, after Daimler (-3.7%) hit shareholders with a profits warning. Daimler expects earnings to be hundreds of millions of euros below forecasts, due to the long-running damage from the diesel emissions scandal. It\u2019s the third profits warning from Daimler, which produces Mercedes-Benz vehicles, this year. European stock markets are creeping higher in early trading, with US-Iranian tensions lingering. The FTSE 100 is up 12 points, with insurance group Admiral (+3%) leading the risers after a broker upgrade. JD Sports (+2.9%) is also making the early running. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA also believes Facebook\u2019s Libra is giving bitcoin a boost: The publicity that the [Libra] launch has once again brought to the space combined with the legitimacy is offers has understandably excited the community and we\u2019ve seen before that you don\u2019t get a normal response when this happens. Whether it actually endorses something like bitcoin or not is perhaps not that important right now, particularly to those that have never lost the faith. It late 2017 is anything to go by, the coming weeks could be a wild ride. Bitcoin clambered as high as $11,247 on the Bitstamp exchange in Luxembourg, before dipping back a little. This surge is reminiscent of the 2017 bitcoin craze, which ended badly: Neil Wilson of Markets.com believes the current rally will fizzle out too - eventually.... All that glitters is not gold. Bitcoin is sparkling again but beware...breakdown\u2019s coming up \u2018round the bend. Bitcoin jumped above $11,000, taking it to its highest level since March 2018. Futures are back down to $10,855 around send time. Investors are ignoring what happened the last time we saw parabolic rises like this. Is it different this time? No, but people have short memories. Facebook\u2019s Libra white paper may have stoked renewed interest in cryptos at a time when the buzz had already returned. Bitcoin is more mature etc, but the fundamentals of this scheme remain unaltered. What I would say is that arguably big money is starting to view this differently and think it could be very costly to ignore if they get left behind.... Bears could get burned before the market turns - maybe better to wait and let it fizzle out, which it will eventually. The more it rallies, the bigger the blow-up when it comes. However, we should expect some pullbacks and retracements along the way. Cryptocurrency bitcoin has smashed through the $11,000 mark for the first time since early 2018 - as money flows back into digital currencies. Bitcoin has now doubled in value since the start of May, profiting those who didn\u2019t lose faith in its prospects after its tumble in 2018 [when it fell from $20,000 to just over $3,000]. So what\u2019s changed? Analysts and crypto-cheerleaders argue that public acceptance of digital currencies is on the rise -- especially with Facebook planning its own currency, Libra. As Jehan Chu, co-founder of Kenetic Capital, an investor in blockchain start-ups told CNBC: \u201cThe price surge is due to two major factors, one is an increasing consensus among the investment community that bitcoin is a legitimate store of value for the digital age, and two Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency launch has forced every CEO to take crypto seriously,\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The threat of military conflict between the US and Iran is weighing on financial markets today, at the start of a crunch week for the global economy. The oil price has hit a new three-week high this morning, with Brent touching $65.79 per barrel for the first time this month. Stocks are also under pressure, as investors eye safe-haven assets such as gold. With Donald Trump vowing to impose more sanctions on Iran today (following the shooting down of a US drone), traders are anticipating rising tensions in the Gulf. John Bolton, White House national security adviser, also fired a verbal shot at Tehran yesterday, warning Iran against complacency. \u201cNeither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness. No one has granted them a hunting licence in the Middle East.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how Iran will retaliate against tougher US sanctions. But following recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman \u2013 a huge oil trading route \u2013 the markets fear supply disruption. Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management explains: The geopolitical escalation in the Middle East is unquestionably a bullish short-term signal for oil markets, as even the thought of 20 % of the world oil supply being affected is enough to trigger significant tremors across oil markets. After a mixed session in Asia, European markets are expected to be subdued this morning. Investors are also looking ahead to the G20 meeting of world leaders at the end of this week, where Trump is expected to discuss the US-China trade war with president Xi. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group doesn\u2019t expect a major breakthrough over the G20 bread rolls: In the dearth of major economic news, the investors\u2019 attention shifts to the political agenda at the start of the week. Besides the Iranian tensions, the upcoming G20 meeting brings the trade war between the US and China back on the table. While Trump and Xi are expected to meet at this week\u2019s summit in Osaka, the chances of a trade deal between the two countries remain slim. Indeed, it is quiet on the economic front, beyond a new survey of German business leaders.
