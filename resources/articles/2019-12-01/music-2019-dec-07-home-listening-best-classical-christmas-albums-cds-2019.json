Is there any reason to add one to a collection? They fall into clear groups: major works, mainstream carols and themed compilations. Two accounts of Bach\u2019s Magnificat are highly recommended: one from the lean, sprightly forces of Solomon\u2019s Knot \u2013 Magnificat: Christmas in Leipzig (Sony) \u2013 coupled with unfamiliar works by two other Leipzig composers, Johann Schelle and Johann Kuhnau; the other from the meatier but still nimble French ensemble La Chapelle Harmonique, directed by Valentin Tournet (Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles Live), paired with Bach\u2019s exuberant Christmas cantata BWV 63, Christen, \u00e4tzen diesen Tag (Christians, engrave this day). \u2022 On a grander scale, all six cantatas, known collectively as Bach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio, are performed by the Thomanechor Leipzig with the Gewandhaus Orchestra, conducted by Gotthold Schwarz and recorded live at the St Thomas Church, Leipzig, where it was first performed (Accentus Music; also on DVD). The American choir Yale Schola Cantorum, conducted by David Hill, gives an ample and well-honed account of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz\u2019s The Christmas Story (Hyperion), Italianate in style but written for the Vespers service, Dresden, in 1660. \u2022 Stile Antico\u2019s A Spanish Nativity (Harmonia Mundi) celebrates music from the Spanish golden age \u2013 Victoria, Guerrero, Rimonte, Morales and more \u2013 sung with characteristic purity and precision by this small ensemble. Two even smaller vocal groups to mention: the four-strong Gothic Voices with Nowell synge we both al and som (Linn), offering a \u201cfeast of Christmas music in medieval England\u201d, mostly \u201canon\u201d; and the Gesualdo Six: Christmas (Hyperion), who combine traditional (Veni Emmanuel, Jingle Bells) with modern settings by Cheryl Frances-Hoad, John Rutter and their director, Owain Park. \u2022 The Secret Life of Carols: 800 Years of Christmas Music (First Hand Records), performed by the Telling, is an atmospheric survey from across Europe, with roots in early English, Irish, German and Finnish traditions, performed by two voices, harps and drum. Equally imaginative and eclectic, in a different style, is The Waiting Sky: Music for Advent and Christmas (Resonus) by the beautifully blended, 18-strong choir Sansara. Let\u2019s not forget, either, the well-chosen Advent Carols from King\u2019s College London (Delphian), a thoughtful programme that stretches from Hildegard of Bingen to the present. \u2022 For a mainstream choice, try O Holy Night \u2013 lustily sung by the London Choral Sinfonia, directed by Michael Waldron (Orchid Classics): with less obvious choices but favourites too, several in the much loved David Willcocks arrangements. \u2022 If all you really want is the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols from the Choir of King\u2019s College, Cambridge, it can be yours: a special own-label live recording of the 100th anniversary service, complete with handsome illustrated liner booklet. It\u2019s directed by the late Stephen Cleobury \u2013 a fitting tribute to a fine musician, who held the post at King\u2019s for 37 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
