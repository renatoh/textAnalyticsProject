The Financial Services Authority (FSA), the City watchdog, today confirmed that it has begun an investigation of share trading activity before the announcement on May 27 of a possible offer for Marks &amp; Spencer by retail tycoon Philip Green. Why are regulators looking at share trading in M&amp;S? As a matter of course, the FSA is obliged to look at any unusual share trading activity before a major corporate deal. It said in a statement that in line with its policy of reviewing all suspicious price movements, it was reviewing trading in M&amp;S shares prior to Mr Green's announcement. What is wrong in buying shares of a company ahead of a deal? It is perfectly acceptable to trade on speculation that a company is about to become a bid target. Typically a company will see its share price rise if it becomes a takeover target, so investors stand make a profit if they buy in the run-up to a bid. What is insider trading? Insider trading covers both legal and prohibited activity. Insider trading takes place legally every day, when corporate insiders - officers, directors or employees - buy or sell stock in their own companies within the confines of company policy and the regulations governing this trading. When is insider trading illegal? As set out in the FSA's code of market conduct, insider trading - or the misuse of information - is behaviour based on information not generally available but which would be relevant to an investor's dealings in a particular investment and which is normally disclosed to the market. The FSA cites the following example: a person learns from his friend that the friend's wife's company is about to become a takeover target. The person buys shares in the wife's company in anticipation of making a profit. Who bought shares before Mr Green's announcement? Several people made a killing from the purchase of M&amp;S shares, at least on paper, including Stuart Rose, the company's new chief executive. Mr Rose bought 100,000 shares on May 7, the same day he took a telephone call from retail tycoon Philip Green inviting him to a meeting. On May 27, Mr Green launched his hostile bid for M&amp;S through his Revival company. What does Mr Rose say? \"If I had done something wrong, I would step down from the company. I have done nothing wrong,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Rose has said he did not know what the meeting with Mr Green, which took place on May 12, was going to be about. He has also said the share purchase and the telephone call with Mr Green were unrelated. How much profit did Mr Rose make? Mr Rose, who is sitting on a profit of \u00a386,000 on the shares, says he saw the investment as a \"top-up to his pension fund\". He also said the size of the share deal was not unusual, and past dealings had often been for double the 100,000 shares purchased. It is thought to be the first time that the chief executive of a blue chip FTSE-100 company has been linked to a suspicious share dealing investigation What is M&amp;S saying? M&amp;S said there were \"clear facts\" showing that Mr Rose had been unaware of an imminent takeover approach from Mr Green when he bought the shares. Paul Myners, M&amp;S chairman and also the chairman of the Guardian Media Group, which owns the Guardian and Observer, said the focus on Mr Rose's transactions was \"a serious attempt to distract shareholders from the real question of value at Marks &amp; Spencer.\" Who else bought large numbers of M&amp;S shares? Michael Spencer, one of the richest men in the City, invested \u00a35.5m in M&amp;S days before Mr Green unveiled his bid. He is sitting on a \u00a31.7m paper profit. Last month, Mr Spencer met Mr Rose at the George Club, an exclusive Mayfair restaurant and bar, on the day before he bought his M&amp;S shares. Both men have said at the time they knew nothing of Mr Green's takeover plans or that Mr Rose would become chief executive of M&amp;S. What about those who know Mr Green? A family trust controlled by Tom Hunter, an entrepreneur who is a close friend of Mr Green, bought 375,000 shares in M&amp;S a month before Mr Green went public with his plans. A spokesman for Mr Hunter has said the entrepreneur had no knowledge of the bid at that time. The Reuben brothers, property billionaires who are acquainted with Mr Green, bought call options on 760,000 M&amp;S shares in April, selling them for a \u00a3437,000 profit in June. There is no suggestion that any of these share dealings were irregular."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
