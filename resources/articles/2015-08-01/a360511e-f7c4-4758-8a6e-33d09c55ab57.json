The latest footfall survey from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and Springboard suggests there is still ample reason for concern over the death of the high street. During the past 12 months, the country\u2019s high streets have seen a 2.2% decline in traffic, while the number of people frequenting shopping centres has dropped by a significant 2.5%, the report said. The rise of online delivery services, as well as many high street shops having their own internt-based stores, has been one factor behind the steady fall in the numbers shopping on the traditional high street, as more and more customers have converted to buying on the web. But John Munro, external affairs advisor at the BRC, said it wasn\u2019t just the ability to order products online that had altered the retail landscape. \u201cThe way that we shop has changed. It\u2019s not only internet shopping, but it certainly has a lot to do with it; as people are now shopping in different ways. Whereas before people browsed at the shops, they are now researching online before they go shopping, and then going out to directly purchase,\u201d Munro said. One bright spot for retailers was the success of retail parks, which faired significantly better than last year, bringing the total loss of footfall in British shops to 1.1%. Helen Dickinson, director general of the BRC, said: \u201cThe continued popularity of retail parks will cheer retailers who have invested in these locations \u2013 a footfall increase of 3.1% is the highest we\u2019ve seen since May 2014.\u201d There are now more retail outlets in town centres than at any time since 2011, with the vacancy rate standing at just 9.8%, 0.3% lower than last year. \u201cThe vacancy rate has remained stubbornly high \u2013 the dip below 10% for the first time may be indicative of successful attempts to reshape Britain\u2019s high streets in some locations,\u201d Dickinson said. She warnedthat the vacancy rate will rise unless retailers succeed in enticing people back to the shops. \u201cNo matter how successful high streets are in re-inventing themselves, if they can\u2019t deliver increased footfall we could easily see vacancy rates climbing again,\u201d she said. The only region to report positive footfall growth was Greater London, with the rest of the UK recording severe declines in some areas. Northern Ireland and Wales especially struggled to attract patrons over the past year, experiencing footfall declines of 4.5% and 4.4%, respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
