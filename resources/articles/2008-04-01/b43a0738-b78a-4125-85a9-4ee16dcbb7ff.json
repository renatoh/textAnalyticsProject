Betancourt, who has joint French and Colombian nationality, is one of the highest profile hostages being held by the rebels from Farc (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). After six years in captivity she has become a cause celebre in France and the fight for her release is a personal crusade of Sarkozy and his wife, Carla. A humanitarian mission to deliver medical aid to Betancourt, said to be weakened from hepatitis B and other illnesses, recently had to turn back after failing to secure cooperation from Farc. Nolberto Uni Vega, her kidnapper, who quit Farc in 2003 and is serving a prison sentence in Colombia, this week called journalists to meet him in jail to explain how he took her and to apologise. She is among the rebels' 39 high-profile hostages. But Uni, 36, said Betancourt's kidnapping happened by accident. On February 23 2002 he was manning a checkpoint on a country road when a car carrying Betancourt passed \"by coincidence\". His long-standing order was \"to detain all politicians of national stature\". Betancourt, who was on the campaign trail with her assistant Clara Rojas, at first thought the uniformed guerrillas were soldiers. But her \"face changed colour\" when she realised she was wrong, said Uni. Farc held the women initially for eight or nine months. \"She was guarded by 20 or 30 guerrillas,\" Uni said of Betancourt. \"One day at 5am they escaped.\" They lasted half a day on the run before guerrillas found them. \"That was when her feet were chained together,\" he said. Uni sent his apology letter to Sarkozy via a journalist who also passed it to her mother. Betancourt's sister declined to comment. The French government insists it is resolved to secure Betancourt's release. But Farc says it no longer has a communications line with France after its negotiator and number two, Ra\u00fal Reyes, was killed last month in a Colombian air strike just over the border in Ecuador. Rojas was freed in January this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
