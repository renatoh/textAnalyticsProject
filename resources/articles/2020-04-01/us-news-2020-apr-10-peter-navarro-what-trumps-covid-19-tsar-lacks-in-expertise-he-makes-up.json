The 70-year-old White House trade adviser was first recruited by Trump because he wrote a string of books about the Chinese strategic threat \u2013 one called Death by China \u2013 despite having spent almost no time in the country and having no grasp of the language. Five of Navarro\u2019s books cited a China hand with a particularly pithy turn of phrase called Ron Vara, who turned out not to exist. The name is an anagram of Navarro and the imaginary expert operated as an alter ego, confirming the author\u2019s views. Navarro made headlines in the past week by challenging Dr Anthony Fauci \u2013 the nation\u2019s leading immunologist and the public face of the US scientific community\u2019s race to contain Covid-19 \u2013 in a showdown in the White House situation room over the merits of an experimental drug. When asked later why he thought he was qualified to start recommending pharmaceuticals to the nation, Navarro replied: \u201cMy qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I\u2019m a social scientist. I have a PhD. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it\u2019s in medicine, the law, economics or whatever.\u201d People who have worked closely with Navarro agree he is undoubtedly bright. He holds a PhD in economics from Harvard. But there is nothing in his career to date that suggests he has the credentials or experience to manage the state intervention necessary to steer US industry towards producing the masks, gowns, ventilators and other life-saving supplies the country will need over the course of this pandemic. Before coming to the White House, Navarro was a west coast academic economist with views on trade far outside the American mainstream and a failed political career behind him, have lost five elections and won none in his adoptive home town of San Diego. His former campaign adviser, Larry Remer, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust him to go out to get lunch and come back with everybody\u2019s sandwich and drink order correctly. I don\u2019t know how he could be put in charge of logistics. \u201cOn one level it\u2019s amusing but on another level, it\u2019s really dangerous,\u201d added Remer, a San Diego political consultant. Navarro\u2019s appearance in the Trump camp during the 2016 presidential campaign came as a shock to those who knew him from his days in San Diego politics. He had started out as a registered Republican but became an anti-growth, environmentalist independent, then a Democratic candidate for Congress in 1996, promoted energetically but unsuccessfully by Hillary Clinton. Navarro came closest to victory in 1992 when he emerged as the surprise contender to be San Diego mayor, taking on the city\u2019s entrenched Republican establishment. He stood as an independent, with a working-class background, determined to stand up for the little guy in the face of rampant development. He called his movement Plan (Prevent Los Angelization Now) and he appeared to have a good chance of winning going into a final television debate a couple of days before the vote. Towards the end of the debate the Republican candidate, Susan Golding, became emotional as she regretted the bruising nature of the campaign, in which the candidates had exchanged multiple slurs. Navarro misjudged the moment, accusing Golding of acting. He came across as cynical and unfeeling, and lost the race at the final hurdle. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the process that really brings out your essence,\u201d Remer said. \u201cAnd in this case it brought out Peter\u2019s essence, which is that he has no people skills at all, and he has no empathy for other people.\u201d The personality problem got worse with each defeat, according to Navarro\u2019s former spokeswoman, Lisa Ross, who worked with him on four campaigns. \u201cAs the years went on and as he kept losing campaign after campaign, he became more and more brittle, more and more confrontational, and ended up \u2026 alienating just about everyone,\u201d Ross said. \u201cPeter was not a nice person at the end of the day \u2026 He can really get in your face.\u201d Ross said she watched Navarro\u2019s extraordinary rise in Trump\u2019s world with open-mouthed astonishment. \u201cHe was the guy who was waving his arms in front of the bulldozer, so it was surprising when he went to work for the biggest bulldozer in the country,\u201d she said, speculating it was his personality that drew Navarro into such close orbit of the president. \u201cIt occurred to me that really Peter and Trump are the same kind of animal. They\u2019re very media savvy but very brittle,\u201d Ross said. \u201cPeter can be a real bully and maybe that\u2019s why Trump picked him. He wanted a bully to do the job.\u201d Navarro\u2019s rollicking 1998 memoir, San Diego Confidential, displays some of the bravado that appears to have attracted Trump, who is said to refer to him as \u201cmy Peter\u201d. In the book Navarro acknowledged his reputation as \u201cthe cruelest and meanest son-of-a-bitch that ever ran for office in San Diego\u201d, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t have any concern at all about making stuff up about my opponent that isn\u2019t exactly true \u2013 I know that bastard running against me doesn\u2019t have any scruples either.\u201d As well as echoing some of Trump\u2019s own traits, Navarro has also shown, on occasion, the gift of prescience. His tirades against China and free trade anticipated the rhetoric that helped Trump win the presidency. In the first two years of the administration, though often marginalised by more powerful, pro-trade officials, he has emerged triumphant long after they have gone. \u201cHe is extraordinarily influential in the White House and whether you like him or not, whether you agree with his politics he caught on early with Donald Trump,\u201d said Walter Lohman, the director of Asian studies at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cHe sort of scratches an itch that Donald Trump has.\u201d Navarro was also vindicated in his dire warnings about the threat of Covid-19, sending a memo to the president in late January with an estimate that it could kill more than half a million Americans and cost close to $6tn. Trump has said he has no recollection of seeing the memo but the White House Cassandra has since emerged looking adept by comparison to the blithe counsel of treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Navarro, the environmental activist turned China hawk, now has one of the most important jobs in the country as the coronavirus pandemic strengthen its grip. He has to save tens of thousands of lives in the face of woefully inadequate preparation by his own administration. He is equipped with little relevant experience and few allies, but with a fierce confidence in his own convictions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
