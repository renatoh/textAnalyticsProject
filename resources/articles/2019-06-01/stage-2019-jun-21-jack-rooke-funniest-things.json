The funniest TV show I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 Broad City. I also love Warwick Davis hosting ITV gameshow Tenable, because he comes out with many Accidental Partridge moments. Each round a teammate can get eliminated into \u201cthe vortex\u201d and Warwick takes a lot of pleasure in quipping: \u201cWhoops-a-daisy, you\u2019ve lost your wife!\u201d The funniest heckle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 The only heckling I\u2019ve ever had is from repressed lads bellowing \u201cSideshow Bob\u201d at me on a directionally opposing tube escalator. And one time I performed with David Icke and he called me \u201ca massive nuisance\u201d. The funniest item of clothing I\u2019ve ever owned \u2026 I have a Cliff Richard T-shirt that was \u00a31 from Deptford market. The week after I bought it, the news was like: \u201cHe\u2019s dodgy!!!\u201d so I stopped wearing it. Then he got cleared of being dodgy so now it\u2019s my pyjama top. The funniest thing that shouldn\u2019t be funny \u2026 The Strictly curse! I mean: come on, straight people! It\u2019s amazing what some sequins and a Latin American movement pattern can do to wreck a home. The funniest hairstyle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 I once had a Brazilian straightening treatment on my hair. Six hours later I looked like Rachel from Friends circa 1998.
