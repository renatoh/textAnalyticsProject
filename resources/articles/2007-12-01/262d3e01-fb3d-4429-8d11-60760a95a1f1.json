A month ago, when City had a three-match losing run including a 6-0 defeat at Ipswich, the early season promotion hopes at Ashton Gate was dissipating rapidly. But since then Gary Johnson's side have gone six games unbeaten and this victory over Barnsley, thanks to an injury time goal from Darren Byfield, put them two points from the top. Byfield's scrambled effort allowed the home side to finally capitalise on the numerical advantage they had held over Barnsley since eight minutes into the second-half. Jamal Campbell-Ryce, who had already been booked in the first period, was given a second yellow card for diving in the area after appearing to beat Liam Fontaine. Replays tended to suggest the referee Keith Hill, who blew his whistle with undue frequency, had been rash rather than brave. \"He couldn't control the game,\" said a furious Barnsley manager, Simon Davey. \"It was just a normal Christmas fixture and he got carried away. There was a foul on Jamal and it was a penalty. The referee has cost us at least a point.\" Even Enoch Showunmi, who scored twice in the first half for City, was less than delighted with the performance of the officials. \"The game gets bitty sometimes,\" he said. \"The lads just want to get on and play.\" Showunmi hooked home his first goal from inside the box when Barnsley failed to deal with a corner. His second came when he headed in from even closer range after Michael McIndoe chipped the ball to the far post as Barnsley again failed to clear their area. Both goals restored parity, for despite being the superior side in the first period, City conspired to fall behind twice, to a fine 25-yard strike from Jonathan Macken, which was Barnsley's first goal in seven away games, and then to a goal from Dennis Souza, who lost his marker and headed home a corner. But on both occasions it was only a matter of minutes before Showunmi equalised. The second half was a drabber affair until Byfield, who was brought on five minutes from time, had the final say. Five of the six goals he has scored this season have been as a substitute - most recently to secure a win against the Championship leaders Watford at Vicarage Road earlier this month - but he is unwilling to be cast in that role. \"I don't want to get the tag of a super-sub,\" said the striker who arrived at Ashton Gate during the summer from the League One strugglers Millwall. \"I can't complain about being on the bench when both the strikers are producing the goods, but I do want to start.\" To do so, he will have to force his way past not just Showunmi, but Lee Trundle, who was excellent and unfortunate on several occasions. It all provides Johnson with a welcome selection problem ahead of City's game at West Bromwich on Boxing Day. Two season ago, the clubs were two divisions apart and today, they are level on points. Bristol City have come a long way in a short time and show no sign of conceding ground without a fight.
