To judge by recent events it will soon be as hard to find a reliable defender as it is to get hold of a plumber, reliable or otherwise. In each case leaks will remain unplugged. This week's Champions League games have highlighted the problem. Arsenal may have conceded only 17 goals in the Premiership but in Vigo on Tuesday they gave two away through their failure to deal with well-aimed but essentially routine centres. The following night Manchester United lost 2-1 to Porto because unexceptional defending was punished by exceptional finishing. At The Valley last Saturday Charlton Athletic, who apart from one weekend have been in the top six of the Premiership since early November, defended like duffers against Blackburn to the extent that at one point in the second half they could not even clear the ball from their own penalty area. Charlton won the match largely because their opponents were equally incompetent at the back. The statistics show that already this season there have been 10 more scoreless draws in the Premiership than there were throughout the whole of 2002-03. Somebody must be defending well although it may be more a case of caution outweighing adventure. The practice of teams packing the midfield and playing with only one out-and-out forward has caught on as the chill of relegation creeps up the table. Managers are setting out to protect their dodgy back fours. Yet goals continue to be conceded too cheaply and cheap goals cheapen the game. The increasing number of occasions on which apparently match-winning leads have been lost, or nearly lost, is further evidence to suggest that teams have forgotten how to close play down. When Tottenham lost an FA Cup replay 4-3 at home to Manchester City, having led 3-0 with the opposition reduced to 10 men, there was little attempt, when danger threatened, to keep possession, slow the tempo and leave the running to a depleted City team. Instead the ball was given away with increasing regularity and the Spurs defence caved in. True, life has become difficult for defenders. They can no longer foul opponents in the pretence of going for the ball and if they bring down an attacker who has broken clear they will be sent off. Kicking the ball back to the goalkeeper has become a risky business because he can no longer pick it up and is often forced into making haphazard clearances under enemy pressure. As if all this was not enough offside has become a lottery, almost entirely dependent on what the officials judge the latest interpretation of Law 11. For instance, how Liverpool's Milan Baros could stand in an offside position, allow a long shot from Steven Gerrard to pass through his legs on its way to the Levski net and still be deemed not to be interfering with play is a mystery. No longer able to step out in the certain knowledge that opponents wandering offside will be penalised, defenders are more inclined to stay deep, which in most cases makes them vulnerable. Central defenders are more often caught square, unsure of each other's responsibilities. Add to this the fact that full-backs, real full-backs not wing-backs or wide midfielders, are an endangered species and the problem becomes critical. Stoutly though Nicky Butt and Roy Keane dealt with the threat Deco posed through the middle, Porto terrorised Manchester United on the flanks on Wednesday and, when the crosses came in, the defence could not cope. United may be a special case, given the absence of Rio Ferdinand and Mikael Silvestre, yet even at full strength Sir Alex Ferguson's defence hardly recreates the dogged strength of Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister or the omnipotent presence of Jaap Stam. Poor defending cost Arsenal the Premiership title last season and the maturing Kolo Tour\u00e9 is a considerable improvement on Pascal Cygan at centre-back. Yet Patrick Vieira remains Arsenal's most important defensive player through his ability to snuff out attacks before they can threaten the back four. With the playing area effectively stretched by the relaxation of offside the importance of having a midfielder strong enough to win the ball, skilful enough to use it constructively and athletic enough to move from penalty area to penalty area and back at regular intervals has become paramount. Vieira is in a class of his own but Claude Makelele, Sylvain Legwinski and Dietmar Hamann look to provide a similar service for Chelsea, Fulham and Liverpool. Knowing Hamann is there enables Gerrard to move forward with more confidence. On Thursday the German's covering tackles often stifled what there was of the Levski attack. In the Champions League the efforts of Thierry Henry and Ruud van Nistelrooy may not be enough should Arsenal or Manchester United fall behind to Juventus or Milan, who last season reminded Europe of what defending should be about even if they bored the pants off Old Trafford in the final. In England, meanwhile, the defence rests - and in Portugal this summer it will rest at its peril."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
