The recommendations fall far short of democracy or unlimited press freedom, but they offer an important insight into debates within the party and the hunger of some officials for greater change. In Storming the Fortress, scholars at the Central Party School in Beijing argue that steady, comprehensive reform could build a \"modern society\" by 2020 and \"mature democracy and rule of law\" in subsequent years. The report argues: \"Citizens' steadily rising democratic consciousness and the grave corruption among party and government officials make it increasing urgent to press ahead with demands for political system reform ... the backwardness of the political system is affecting economic development.\" It stresses that the party must keep overall control, but offers a detailed account of how gradual political reform could unfold in three phases over the next twelve years. It suggests that the party's powers could be restricted and increasing freedom given to citizens, journalists and faith groups. The national parliament could be given the power to set and audit government spending, the report suggests, while the party should come under the rule of law. While government censorship of the media would still exist, the current system is arbitrary and lacks transparency, it argues. The authors call for a law to protect journalists and halt \"unconstitutional interference\" in their work, adding: \"Freedom of the press is an inevitable trend.\" They also suggest a relaxation of controls in the highly sensitive area of religion, arguing that political and religious faith are not in contradiction. \"Until now political reform has been scattered and inconsequential,\" Wang Guixiu, a professor at the Party School who was not involved in the study, told Reuters. \"Real political reform needs a substantive plan of action, and there are some scholars and officials who believe that's what is needed now.\" A recent survey by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences suggested that mid-ranking officials are increasingly keen to see greater political change. Well over half of those questioned named the political system as one of the three areas of reform most concerning them - compared with only two-fifths in the same survey two years before. But campaigners have warned that if anything China is cracking down on dissent in the run-up to the Olympics. Dissident journalist Li Datong, who has not yet read the report, cautioned: \"I believe it will only be a thought rather than a political trend of the Communist party. The Communist party might take some suggestions from the plan but I don't think it can be seen as a signal. \"There won't be any serious discussion about the political system reform before the Olympics. There might be something coming out by the end of the year and before that [there] will just be stabilisation.\" The report was completed shortly after the 17th party congress last year, but has only just been published."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
