Pitching in with low-tenor rumbles and high-brass squealing that turns almost at once to yearning, long-note curls, the first long track then becomes a classic Parker episode of solo-sax polyphony, an almost silent passage of murmurs, outbreaths and pad-flappings, then a mournfully harmonious finale. Squeezed-valve sounds and softly percussive noises open the second piece, on which McPhee yelps playfully over Parker's restlessly turning cyclical figures; then growling, low-brass sounds underpin wriggling reed lines, Coltranesque ballad tonalities and a Don Cherryesque vivacity on the shorter third section. It's a must for free-jazz disciples of Parker and McPhee, but the uninitiated may also find much to enjoy in this gracefully rational and divertingly varied exhibition of improv."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
