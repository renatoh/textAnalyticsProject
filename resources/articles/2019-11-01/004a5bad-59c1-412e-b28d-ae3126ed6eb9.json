David West Read, who did the book, writes in the programme: \u201cIt was during this period when my brain wasn\u2019t working properly that I developed the idea for &amp; Juliet.\u201d I\u2019m not sure he is being ironic. The show starts in London\u2019s Shoreditch with Shakespeare and his wife, Anne Hathaway, having a marital spat about the ending of his tragedy about doomed love. \u201cWhat if Juliet didn\u2019t kill herself?\u201d asks Anne, devising a sequel in which the revived heroine defies her parents\u2019 plan to send her to a nunnery and flees to Paris accompanied by her nurse and a non-binary best friend called May. Periodically, Shakespeare tries to retrieve a story that defies synopsis. I would add that it is odd to present Juliet as an icon of independence and then land her with jokes in which she pronounces ce soir as \u201cCaesar\u201d and greets a woman called Madeleine as \u201cVasseline.\u201d The idiotic book is simply a way of contriving to work in such familiar chart-toppers as Baby One More Time and It\u2019s Gonna Be Me. The one time I thought this worked was when May, played by Arun Blair-Mangat as a cross-dressing guy, sang I\u2019m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman. But if tedium is kept at bay, it is largely through the noisy energy of Luke Sheppard\u2019s production and the performances of Miriam-Teak Lee as the freedom-seeking Juliet, Cassidy Janson as the mutinous Anne Hathaway and Oliver Tompsett as her vainglorious husband. I still fail to see the point of a show like this: if the audience want to hear just the songs, why not present them in concert form? It feels gratuitous to attach them to a plot that, in its desperation to sound the right feminist notes, becomes almost painfully hip. \u2022 At Shaftesbury theatre, London, until 30 May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
