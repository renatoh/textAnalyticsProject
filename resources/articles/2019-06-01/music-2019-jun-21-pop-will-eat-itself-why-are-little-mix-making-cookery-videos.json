That the band survive says more about their constitutions than it does Jesy\u2019s cooking, although any lingering thoughts of the food are quickly erased by her \u201centertainment\u201d, which features a mortified male stripper who doesn\u2019t seem to want to a) dance or b) strip. But why is this happening? Why now? And why food? The perfect storm of dwindling record sales and social media\u2019s quest for total insight into every aspect of a pop star\u2019s life has meant record labels are having to dream up new avenues for relatable content, with food becoming a unifying arena in which to solidify only previously glimpsed personalities. Earlier this month, Ed Sheeran partnered with Heinz to create his own Edchup, while Jessie Ware is already on season six of her dinner-based podcast, Table Manners. Previously, pop stars were so starry that even the thought of them eating was unimaginable, but now that privacy-agnostic YouTubers are the new idols, the parameters have shifted. So what else do we learn about Little Mix? Well, we find out during Jade\u2019s night that while Jesy has never played bingo before, she\u2019s keen to create some new calls (\u201cTwenty-one; young and full of cum,\u201d for example), and that Jade isn\u2019t about to let gravity stop her when it comes to recreating the Angel of the North in chocolate (spoiler: it melts and slides down the wall like a sticky turd). That Little Mix have chosen cookery as a new outlet also continues a grand girl band tradition. In 2008, Atomic Kitten\u2019s Liz McClarnon beat Steps\u2019 Claire Richards to be crowned Celebrity MasterChef, while seven years later Pussycat Doll Kimberly Wyatt out saut\u00e9ed seasoned reality TV star and former Girl Aloud Sarah Harding to win the same crown. And who could forget Liberty X\u2019s Michelle Heaton, who confessed to having the shits after eating Lee Ryan\u2019s cooking on an episode of Celebrity Come Dine With Me? Eat in With Little Mix may never quite reach such lows, but it does show pop\u2019s continued ability to think outside the (Domino\u2019s pizza) box."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
