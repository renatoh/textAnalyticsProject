Wrong! Writer Tom Bromley's new book, All In The Best Possible Taste, is a memoir about growing up watching TV in the 80s. We asked him to outline how things might have been different. Dynasty was originally called Oil A not-so-subtle reference to the fact that the show was American network ABC's answer to CBS's Dallas. Dallas's own beginnings were equally muddled \u2013 the original pitch was a Romeo (Bobby) and Juliet (Pam) of the oilfields, with the JR character being \"just the brother\". Roly in EastEnders was meant to be an Alsatian Then the call went out for a German Shepherd called Prince, only for Dirty Den to end up with a poodle instead \u2026 The part of Del Boy in Only Fools and Horses was originally offered to Jim Broadbent He turned it down as he was appearing in a West End play. Another actor who was sounded out before David Jason agreed to the part was Enn Reitel, the voice of Lester Piggott in Spitting Image. Blackadder was almost cancelled after series one Which was sort of fair enough as it had cost a fortune to make and was a bit rubbish. Eventually, expensive outside broadcasts were swapped for jokes about thingy-shaped turnips and the rest is history-based comedy. Spitting Image was nearly called Rubber News Other working titles included the Acme Satire Company and \u2013 apologies if the following image is distressing \u2013 Hands Up Mrs Thatcher. David Bowie and Mick Jagger were meant to have a Transatlantic duet at Live Aid However, satellite delays scuppered the proposed Dancing In The Streets cover and Phil Collins was sent over on Concorde to perform. Dirty Den was almost killed off first time around in EastEnders Den met his original soap death when he was brutally gunned down by a bunch of daffodils. But a quick-thinking BBC1 controller ordered the dead body shots to be removed, thus allowing the actor to return to the series, just as soon as webcams had been invented. All In The Best Possible Taste (Simon &amp; Schuster) is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
