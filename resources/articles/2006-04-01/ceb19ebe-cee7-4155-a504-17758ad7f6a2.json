British MEPs and some 150 others were right to demand, at the start of yesterday's plenary session in Strasbourg, that all business be conducted in future in Brussels, saving taxpayers' money and making the parliament's vital committee work more effective. The MEPs were forced to use an obscure procedural device to raise the matter - opposed, bizarrely, by the French Green and former 1968 streetfighter, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. The requirement that the EU's only democratically-elected body sit in the capital of Alsace 12 times a year was accepted by John Major at the Edinburgh summit in 1992 in a classic trade-off. Parliament does not have the power to decide to abandon Strasbourg - it must be done by a unanimous vote of all 25 member states. Jacques Chirac or any possible successor in the Elys\u00e9e Palace is unlikely to let that happen. No one objects to Strasbourg or the cash generated for it by the parliament. The city is delightful, stuffed with fine restaurants and half-timbered charm. It symbolises Franco-German reconciliation, the axis around which modern Europe was rebuilt to ensure the Rhine would never again be a border between enemies. The problem is that the parliament, dubbed \"Faulty Towers\" when it opened in 1999, spends 13% of its budget on moving 3,000 people for three days a month. This is hardly efficient use of its 750-seat debating chamber, 1,133 offices, meeting rooms, restaurants, bars and a vast press room. Complaints that journalists have been accepting free trips to Strasbourg - an issue for media organisations as much as parliament - highlights the problem of accessibility as well as boredom. Flights from Brussels are overpriced and overbooked and the train journey takes five hours. The parliament deserves to be judged - and reported on - on its merits. It has acquired new powers in recent years and has to approve much of the legislation initiated by the commission - as shown by the lobbyists thronging its corridors. MEPs have yet to clean up their own lavish perks and expenses, another element of the gravy train image. If member states cannot agree to end this wasteful circus, they should not claim to be surprised when turnout in European elections plummets again - and should spare us anguished soul-searching at a Europe \"disconnected\" from its peoples."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
