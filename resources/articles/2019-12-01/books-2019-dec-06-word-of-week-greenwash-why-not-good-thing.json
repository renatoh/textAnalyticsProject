And it accused fund manager BlackRock of \u201cgreenwash\u201d for not requiring the same. Well, everybody loves green things and washing, so why is a combination of them bad? As a noun, \u201cgreenwash\u201d has since 1987 meant commercial propaganda that propagates an environmentally virtuous public image \u2013 such as ads for oil companies featuring cute wildlife. Before that, the verb \u201cgreenwashing\u201d was sometimes used as a term for money laundering on behalf of drug cartels, because the US dollars being laundered were \u201cgreenbacks\u201d. Both senses imply the removal of a stain, and \u201cgreenwash\u201d was coined on analogy with \u201cwhitewash\u201d, the figurative use of which \u2013 to mean the erasure of flaws \u2013 is first attributed to the Tory leader Viscount Bolingbroke in 1730. Observers who recall David Cameron\u2019s promise to run the \u201cgreenest government ever\u201d, as well as Boris Johnson\u2019s current claim that getting to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 will be a top priority if he wins the election, might suppose that Bolingbroke\u2019s modern heirs are also leaders in greenwashing. \u2022 Steven Poole\u2019s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
