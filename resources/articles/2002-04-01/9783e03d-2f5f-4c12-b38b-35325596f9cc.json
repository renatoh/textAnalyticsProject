Virginia Woolf and Ernest Hemingway make guest appearances in the fictional memoirs of writer Logan Mountstuart, but the Loafer can't help feeling that Boyd has managed a couple of more contemporary digs. Mountstuart, for example, is highly gratified by some dental treatment he has carried out in New York, thus avoiding the profound depression that Waugh and Eliot experienced when their own teeth were removed. \"Is this a writer's problem?\" he muses. \"A feeling that when we lose our bite we might as well throw in the towel?\" To whom can he possibly be referring? \u00b7 Staunchly royalist bookworms have never had it so good, what with the flood of tributes to the Queen Mum finally making their way out of the warehouses where they've been lurking for years. They might not have expected, however, to see her with a snooker cue in hand, looking for all the world like a fledgling Ronnie O'Sullivan (almost). The book in question is the paperback of the late Mordecai Richler's On Snooker, due to be published in October and previewed in Random House's catalogue. Whether the image will survive the arbiters of taste and decorum remains to be seen. \u00b7 Called on for \"a stately speech\" such as \"grave livers do in Scotland use\" (William Wordsworth), Andrew O'Hagan, Janice Galloway, A L Kennedy and Alan Spence did their best at a recent festival celebrating Caledonian-American links in New York. But the centrepiece of Distilled (the event was sponsored by a whisky company) was Sean Connery leading 5,000 bagpipers up 6th Avenue, scheduled for the same time as the writers' talks. How were the poor scribes ever going to compete? \u00b7 The storm brewing in the US over Amazon.com's policy of marketing second-hand copies of new books alongside their full-price editions has finally come to a head. For Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the crunch came when the Authors Guild urged its 8,000 members to remove links to the e-tailer from their own websites. After suggesting that all their customers send civil but remonstrative emails to the Authors Guild, Amazon claimed that over 4,000 of them had complied virtually straight off. Such loyalty - or self-interest - is of little comfort to the beleaguered guild, which argues that its fight to protect members' royalties has been harshly judged."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
