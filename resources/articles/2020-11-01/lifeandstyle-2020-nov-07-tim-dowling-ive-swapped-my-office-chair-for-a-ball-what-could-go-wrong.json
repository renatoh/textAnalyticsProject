What could go wrong?", "bodyText": "I am sitting in my office, using a blue inflatable gym ball instead of a chair. This was recommended to me as a cure for certain occupational ailments, including neck pain, back pain and shoulder pain. The first time I reached across my desk for a pencil and ended up on the floor, I thought: this isn\u2019t going to work. But it does work. My neck has stopped hurting, my shoulders don\u2019t ache and my core is permanently engaged. I rarely fall off the ball any more. After two weeks, I can balance on it with my feet in the air while drinking a cup of coffee. The only thing I can\u2019t do on the ball is work. The constant, low-level concentration required to stay upright makes it impossible to think about anything else. This, if I\u2019m honest, is the best part. The office door opens and my wife leans in. \u201cI\u2019m going to the supermarket,\u201d she says. \u201cCan you think of anything we need?\u201d I turn toward her while allowing the ball to roll backwards, deftly hooking the underside of the desk with a finger to stop myself going too far. \u201cCat food,\u201d I say. \u201cEnjoying your ball?\u201d she says. \u201cYes, thank you,\u201d I say. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s cold in the mornings, so I have to\u2026\u201d \u201cText me if you think of anything,\u201d she says, already halfway across the garden. When she is gone I spend 10 minutes bouncing gently on the ball. For a moment I remember that we need milk, but then I forget all about it. After lunch, I linger in the kitchen. The oldest one, who is working from home all week, is sitting at the far end of the table with his laptop open in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m getting absolutely nothing done,\u201d I say, \u201cbut the core is strong.\u201d \u201cI have a Zoom meeting in, like, 10 minutes,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be out of your hair,\u201d I say. \u201cI just need to be able to sit for a while without thinking about it.\u201d Suddenly he stands up, stalks across the room, switches off the radio and sits back down. \u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cI hate the radio,\u201d he says. The youngest one walks in. \u201cYo,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy do old people have the radio on all the time?\u201d the oldest says. \u201cIt stops them being lonely,\u201d the youngest says. \u201cIt\u2019s like company for them.\u201d \u201cAll day long in the background, talking shit,\u201d the oldest says. \u201cHow can you concentrate?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s called multitasking,\u201d I say. The following evening I find myself back at the kitchen table, feeling low and a little angry. That morning, in spite of my newfound coordination and core strength, I had dropped a big container of milk at the Sainsbury\u2019s self-checkout, and watched it explode at my feet. The episode was so personally humiliating that I have not mentioned it to anyone. The oldest one is still at the end of the table behind his laptop. The youngest one is cooking and my wife appears to be talking to me. \u201cWhat?\u201d I say. \u201cI was just wondering if you might like to help me unload the dishwasher,\u201d she says. \u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, if your schedule will allow it.\u201d \u201cSomething happened to me in Sainsbury\u2019s today,\u201d I say quietly. The oldest one stands up and turns off the radio. \u201cI was listening to that!\u201d my wife says. \u201cNo one was listening to that,\u201d he says. \u201cI can never go back there,\u201d I say. \u201cIt is really annoying,\u201d the youngest one says. \u201cI learned this yesterday,\u201d I say. \u201cThe young people of today hate radio.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d my wife says, turning the radio back on. \u201cThey hate it because it doesn\u2019t have any memes on it,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Grandad,\u201d the youngest says. \u201cThe young people of today communicate almost exclusively through memes,\u201d I say. \u201cDid you watch a documentary about memes last night or something?\u201d the oldest says. \u201cNo,\u201d I lie. I\u2019m going out to my office, I think. And I won\u2019t come back until I can stand on the ball."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
