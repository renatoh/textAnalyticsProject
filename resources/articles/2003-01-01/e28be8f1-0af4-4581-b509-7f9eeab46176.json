Failing to cling on to early gains, the FTSE-100 closed down 18.5 points, or 0.5%, at 3,603.7, having touched an earlier low of 3,583.7 - its lowest intraday level since late December 1995. The fall stretched the index's losing streak to a record 10 days. The market appeared to be heading for a positive close, but early losses on Wall Street and a drop in GlaxoSmithKline, the drugmaker, took the wind out of a morning rally. GSK shed 3.8% after news that a US clinical trial of its asthma drug Serevent had been stopped because of a small number of life-threatening episodes. The market has dropped 9% since January 10, with traders increasingly worried about the prospect of war against Iraq. As investors braced themselves for a US-led strike, US shares fell to their lowest level in three months. Weakness in energy and insurance stocks outweighed upbeat earnings news from the technology sector. In lunchtime trading, the Dow Jones index of leading US shares was down 146.6 points, or 1.7%, to 8,222.81, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index was down 16.59 points, or 1.8%, at 870.75. The Nasdaq technology market slumped 30.9 points, or 2.2%, to 1,357.3. \"The market is seeing the supportive influence of positive earnings reports and yesterday's gains negated by unease over the potential for war,\" said John Simon, a stock index futures analyst with TradeSignals.com, a commodity trading adviser. Meanwhile, the dollar slid to fresh 3-year lows against the euro because of war jitters, and sent skittish investors racing for the relative safety of US treasuries. Further pressure on financial markets can be expected next week as the momentum for war picks up. UN weapons inspectors, who have spent two months searching for evidence of arms that Iraq denies having, are due to present their findings to the security council on Monday. The following day, President George Bush is expected to make his case against Iraq in his state of the union address."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
