Harry, it must be said, was never incendiary. Strolling round the ground in the afternoon sunshine here yesterday it was a story that came readily to mind as Michael Papps and Mark Richardson refused to budge amid friendly bowling on a benign pitch. Finally, with record books being thumbed and the final session well under way, they were both dismissed in the space of a couple of overs by Kent's Yorkshire import David Stiff. The pair had added 244 for the first wicket, which was by 15 runs a New Zealand record against the counties and only three short of their all-time best in England, dating back to 1949. Papps, a 24-year-old from Christchurch, batted for 288 minutes in making 126 to become one of the few players to have scored centuries both for his native Canterbury and in the Kent city of the same name. His was a diligent effort by a player attempting to establish himself in the side after a poor debut series against South Africa late last year. He is a chunky individual, right-handed and, with a strong bottom hand, keener on the cut than the drive, something ruthlessly exploited by the likes of Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini, who bowled fuller than he might like and claimed lbw decisions as a result. England, one assumes, will have taken note. Yesterday his lbw was self-induced as in a moment of frivolity he attempted to flick a straight ball over midwicket, missed and suffered the consequences. Kent, minus the requisite quota of first-team regulars as is apparently demanded by tourist matches these days, can rue two extra lives offered to Papps, Robert Ferley putting down a head-high chance at second slip when he was on 23 and David Fulton doing likewise at first slip 11 runs later. With the New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming contemplating opening in the first Test despite his abdominal injury, Papps, who would probably be in direct competition with the middle-order batsman Craig McMillan otherwise, may not make the side even on the strength of this innings. Richardson will, and in this form will give the Lord's crowd something to look forward to - stupor. His 92 took more than five hours before he appeared to lose sight of a slower ball from Stiff, offered no shot and saw the ensuing full toss flatten his off stump. In this there was a blessing as Nathan Astle (32 not out) and Scott Styris (14 not out) upped the tempo against the new ball and added 44 runs before the close, increasing the prospect of some entertainment this morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
