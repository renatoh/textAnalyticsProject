It was, he said, appropriate that on a day when millions stood in silence to commemorate the victims of terrorism in America, we should be experiencing an opera \"that, if nothing else, celebrates the eternity of life\". In many respects, his words were apt - Janacek's haunting fable envisions the perpetual renewal of existence in the face of humanity's violence. Yet this is only part of the story. The opera - begun after the first world war - argues that violence, far from being confined to humanity, is an element in nature itself, while its animal characters embody an anthropomorphic satire on the shifting values of western culture. Its stance is ultimately conservative. Much has been made of the Vixen's feisty feminism, but her progressive rhetoric is essentially a ploy to bring about the destruction of the Hens in the chicken run. The mating of the Vixen and the Fox is accompanied by some of Janacek's most sensual music, but any idea of sexual liberalism is rapidly quashed when the pair scamper off to be married by a Woodpecker. Annabel Arden's production grapples with the opera's ambiguities without fully probing them. Regeneration is given stronger prominence than social comment. Richard Hudson's set, a pale labyrinth of ramps, is beautifully transformed as life renews itself. Both the immediate postwar world and the hints of violence in nature are conjured up by some extraordinary costumes - Flies in gas masks and spiked helmets, the Rooster as a mud-spattered general. But Arden's direction begins to lose its focus. Janis Kelly, however, is a glorious Vixen - an alluring, sexy-voiced hothead, who yields to Giselle Allen's butch Fox with erotic glee. Elsewhere, things take a while to gather momentum. There's an uncertainty of tone in Steven Sloane's conducting and he only really strikes form in the final scenes, in which the Forester (Christopher Purves, singing beautifully) realises that man, far from trying to tame nature, must accept himself as part of its transient scheme. Janacek unleashes a torrent of emotion and Sloane's handling of the sequence knocks you sideways - but comes a fraction late. Until then, the magic has only been intermittent. \u0095 In rep until September 28. Box office: 0113-222 6222. Grand Theatre"}, "isHosted": false}}}
