In the ingeniously contrived first part, a Shinigami or god of death gives a brilliant student a 'death note' which enables him merely by writing someone's name in it to bring about their death by whatever way he prescribes. He uses it to kill the villains his father, a senior police inspector, can't nail and becomes a vigilante hero. But the power goes to his head and a cat-and-mouse game develops between him and a super sleuth brought in by the cops. The new film introduces another similarly equipped vigilante, a girl this time, but the cast ends up being strangled by a serpentine plot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
