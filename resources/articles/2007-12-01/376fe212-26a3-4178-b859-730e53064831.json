Walsh, who found vicarious fame as manager of Boyzone and Westlife, has told Guardian Media that the lachrymose Glaswegian 18-year-old \"won by about 10% of the total vote\", adding: \"Rhydian is the better singer, there's no doubt about that in my mind, but Leon's last [video clip], when he made an emotional appeal to the public, probably pipped it for him.\" Whether this mollifies Roberts's angry Welsh supporters - who include the Welsh first minister, Rhodri Morgan, who claims he could not get through to register his vote - remains to be seen, but the blond haired baritone's mum, Angela, has also told them to move on. \"We're just asking the nation to let it go,\" she told the South Wales Echo. \"We give our very best to Leon as a family.\" After selecting an eclectic range of contributors to deliver an alternative Christmas message to the Queen's over the years - they've included Sharon Osbourne, Ali G and Quentin Crisp - Channel 4 announced yesterday that this year's choice is Sgt Major Andrew Stockton of the Royal Artillery, who lost an arm in Afghanistan last year. His message, perhaps not so different from Her Majesty's, will be that the public ought to be more supportive of the troops in their difficult and dangerous job. The Hollywood actor Michael Douglas has been selected for perhaps his least demanding role by US broadcaster NBC, which persuaded him to voice the recorded introduction to its nightly news broadcast. The bulletin's presenter, Brian Williams, said: \"I appealed to his sense of romance and sentimentality ... (and told him) wherever you are on Earth, at 6.30pm eastern time, you'll know your voice is on air.\" Over on CBS the news bulletin is still introduced by a tape voiced by 91-year-old Walter Cronkite, who retired in 1981. Those who have missed the much-acclaimed South African township version of Mozart's Magic Flute - Impempe Yomlingo - during its current run at the Old Vic will be able to catch it next spring during an eight-week run in the West End. The production features youngsters whose backgrounds had never included classical music, formed into a company by the Oscar-winning producer Eric Abraham. It has been directed by Mark Dornford-May, with its star, the singer Pauline Malefane stephen.bates@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false}}}
