Which is probably a good thing for Apple, whose new iPhone runs OSX. If you're saying a company's software is full of holes, it looks bad when you're reduced by day 3 to pointing to a weakness in VLC, a cross-platform open-source media viewer. Things weren't much better on days 6, 7 or 8, which showed flaws in the PDF specification - which is hardly an Apple-only issue - in the third-party Omniweb browser (which got fixed the same day) and in a third-party add-on called Application Program Enhancer, which is far from universally used. Yet the reality is that Apple's OSX does have bugs and vulnerabilities which could let a determined attacker do all sorts of things. Among the main classes of exploit are privilege escalation (where OSX lets you do things you're not authorised to), buffer overflows (stuffing too much data into a fixed-size space) and cross-scripting (where the computer lets a program run, wrongly believing it to be something that isn't a program). OSX and Apple's applications are vulnerable - they're computer programs, so must contain flaws - but the question is, are the vulnerabilities serious, and are they widespread? Using the MOAB's data, the answers are \"only maybe\" and \"only the Apple ones\". However, it only needs one serious flaw in a universally-used program or the operating system itself and your whole edifice is troubled, which seems to be the case with day 5's flaw, which lets an outsider plant a program on an Apple machine using OSX's inbuilt \"package manager\". Nor is there yet a fix for the flaw exploited last month (and cited on day 3) in Apple's Quicktime, which led to thousands of MySpace users having their passwords stolen. Observers dislike the way these flaws are being exposed: in security circles, publishing the exploit before warning the potentially exploited is akin to farting in church: it's impolite, and people wish you'd give them some warning instead. Dave Marcus, security research and communications manager for McAfee Avert Labs, told eWeek that quite when you should tell people you're about to unleash a vulnerability is \"an area of contention\" but that \"disclosing them in this manner puts users at risk, and that's never a good process\". Apple has not yet issued any fixes for the flaws. However, if you're fretting that d00dZ might be out to pwn your Mac, you could visit Landon Fuller's site, where he's trying to offer fixes and soothing noises for each of the MOAB bugs. And after January? Well, Vista is launched at the end of this month, and there's 11 months left in 2007 ... \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
