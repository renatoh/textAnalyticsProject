Sir John Stevens said while anti-terror officers were \"working three times harder than ever\" to defend against atrocities such as that committed in Madrid last week, it would be a matter of time before \"some sort of attack gets through\". Sir John said: \"Since September 11 there have been 520 arrests, half have been charged with an offence and there are 90 about to go through to court. \"We do know that we have actually stopped terrorist attacks happening in London but, as the prime minister and home secretary have said, there is an inevitability that some sort of attack will get through but my job is to make sure that does not happen.\" His comments were echoed by London mayor Ken Livingstone, who said at his monthly public briefing that it would be \"miraculous\" if the city were not attacked. Britain is widely viewed as the next potential target of al-Qaida or associated extremists following the Madrid bombings, as both countries strongly supported the US invasion of Iraq last year despite fierce opposition across Europe. Results of a poll released today showed that three-quarters of Britons feel \"more vulnerable\" to terrorist attack because of the government's decision to join military action in Iraq. And, in spite of the outgoing Spanish government's initial insistence that Basque separatists Eta were behind last Thursday's attack, Islamist militants are now the prime suspects for the rush-hour blasts, which killed 201 and injured 1,500 people. According to the Spanish media, police have identified six Moroccans who they suspect carried out the attack. In spite of the growing fears of an attack on Britain, however, cuts in emergency planning funds mean the country is not prepared for a Madrid-style terror attack, an expert warned today. Local authorities are being given new powers to act in the face of major incidents by legislation currently before parliament. But the powers are no use without more money, according to Patrick Cunningham, president of the Emergency Planning Society, which represents councils and emergency services. \"As things stand we are not 100% prepared by any means to deal with a Madrid-type disaster,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Probably the main reason for that is that funding for local authorities' emergency planning has fallen from \u00a324.5 million in 1991 to \u00a319 million in the present day.\" Responding to the results of today's poll, Foreign Office minister Bill Rammell told Sky News: \"I obviously understand people's concerns, especially in the wake of the appalling tragedy last Thursday, but the reality is that all of us are at risk of attack from organisations like al-Qaida. \"Before the Iraq war and before the Afghanistan conflict, we had 9/11, which was a huge attack on the civilised world. That was planned years before. \"Therefore this idea being put about by some people that if you didn't support the war you are safe is simply not true. There have been 60 nations across five continents in recent years who have been subjected to these kinds of attacks.\" Meanwhile, EU officials were today working on proposals to improve Europe's anti-terror measures in the wake of the Madrid bombs, which will be presented to the European commissioners by justice commissioner Antonio Vitorino tomorrow. The ideas will be considered by EU justice and home affairs ministers at an emergency summit on Friday, then discussed by foreign affairs ministers on Monday. Final decisions on action will be made by European heads of government at a long-scheduled meeting on March 25, which was due to be about economic progress but will now inevitably be dominated by the atrocities in Spain. In his address at City Hall today, Mr Livingstone said: \"It would be miraculous if, with all the terrorist resources arranged against us, if terrorists did not get through, and, given that some are prepared to give their own lives, it would be inconceivable that someone does not get through to London.\" He added: \"We have known all along there are people trying to come here and take lives. Everything we have done has been simply to protect life. There are people out their who will take life in the hundreds and thousands.\" Mr Livingstone stressed that London remains one of the safest cities in the world. He pointed out that most venues are covered by CCTV cameras which would make it difficult for bombers to escape. And cameras used for transport systems such as the congestion charge could also be used to close the net on terrorists."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
