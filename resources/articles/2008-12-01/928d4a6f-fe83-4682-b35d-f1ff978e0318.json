It just happens that his job is chairman of the Republican National Committee. After losing the presidency and falling to 41 Senate and 178 House seats, the average Republican has as much interest in keeping Duncan around as the average auto worker has in giving Rick Wagoner, the head of General Motors, a pay raise. One of Duncan's ploys to build up his image came when Rod Blagojevich, the poetry-loving governor of Illinois, was arrested. Duncan's RNC saw an opportunity: Take down Barack Obama. The president-elect's \"carefully parsed vague statements\" about Blagojevich were \"unacceptable\", said Duncan. Days later the RNC released a two-minute video tying Obama to Blagojevich. It was titled Questions Remain, although none really did: footage of Obama endorsing Blagojevich in 2002 and of Obama's aide David Axelrod claiming that Obama had talked to the governor after election day didn't connect the president-elect to the governor's scandals in any way that mattered. What was the RNC trying to do besides look busy? Simple: do what John McCain never could and \"knock the halo\" off Obama. By connecting him again and again to an ongoing investigation, and to the spectre of Chicago politics, Republicans want to do to Obama what they feel they did to Bill Clinton. It's why a lower-level campaign has been mounted against Rahm Emanuel, Obama's chief of staff, and why Republican senators are asking to stretch out the confirmation hearings for Eric Holder, Obama's attorney general-designate. Is any of it going to stick? Well, no. The more we've learned about the Blagojevich scandal, the less it looks like Obama and his staff will be implicated. According to Greg Craig's internal Obama campaign investigation, released on Tuesday, Obama never spoke to Blagojevich about the Senate appointment, Emanuel did so once or twice and no one took the imploding governor's wheeling and dealing seriously. And the bigger picture is that Republicans haven't internalised the lessons of the last few decades of political controversy \u2013 especially the Clinton scandals. In the eight-year standoff between Republicans and Bill Clinton, the president won. Impeached, yes; mocked by Jay Leno, sure. And in the process, Republicans lost two national elections, most of their gains from their historic 1994 congressional victory and their visionary speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, felled by a party coup after the 1998 Monica Lewinsky saga backfired on the Republicans. Gingrich's party couldn't get much leverage from Clinton's scandals because they could never convince the country that the scandals' damage extended beyond a small circle of people. How did it affect the average middle-class voter of the 1990s \u2013 stock portfolio looking stronger, tax burden getting lower \u2013 if the president kept bad company in Arkansas, or if he'd benefited wrongly from a land deal or if he'd gotten frisky with an intern? It didn't. The Republican party became a party of churls. Yes, George Bush took shots at Clinton's morality when he ran for president in 2000, with references to the \"honour and decency\" he'd restore to the White House. But that wasn't how he won. He won by making concessions that he thought Clinton had governed rather well, and that government could be more efficient \u2013 more educational standards, coordination with religious charities, Medicare that cut down on drug prices for the aged \u2013 but not stripped down. That's the history that Gingrich had in mind when he attacked the RNC for its full-court-press against Obama over Blagojevich. He blamed \"negative, attack politics\" for the party's recent losses, but he protested too much: those were the mistakes that killed his own revolution a decade ago. Yet as successful as Gingrich has been in presenting himself as an elder statesman, he has let the history of those 1990s blunders fade. And so his party is stuck in a Sisyphean cycle of pumping up scandals and hoping that the latest one will solve their political problems. The coming battle over Eric Holder will start the cycle over again. Last week The Hill reported that Republicans on the Senate judiciary committee have requested documents from the Clinton presidential library on 17 dimly remembered scandals that happened while Holder was deputy attorney general of the US. What did he know about Al Gore's fundraising in a Buddhist temple? What advice did he give the president when he pardoned international fugitive Marc Rich? Most importantly, did he tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth about the Elian Gonzalez saga? The idea that any of this chatter will hurt the president-elect, or even slow down Holder's confirmation in a Senate that will contain the smallest Republican minority since 1978, is ludicrous. It's a stalling tactic for a party that has yet to figure out what it stands for after Bush leaves office. In some ways it's even worse than that \u2013 it's a grasp backwards toward a political strategy that stranded the party in the late 1990s. Will Obama eventually trip into some real abuse-of-power scandal that Congress and special prosecutors will have to pick apart? He'd be the first president not to. But the matters obsessing Republican senators and Mike Duncan won't even ding Obama or be remembered three months from now. Eventually, the party's got to figure this out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
