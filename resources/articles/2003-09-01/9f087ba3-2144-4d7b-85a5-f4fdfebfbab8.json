Then the last century saw a new wave of invaders - tourists. But it seems the Italians want to keep this unspoilt, rugged and ancient island all to themselves. How else can you explain the fact that Time Out's budget airline destination guide features the most unrepresentative and unappealing picture? Or that finding information online seems to be a deliberately frustrating experience? Now that Ryanair fly here twice a day, you can understand the Italians' coyness about Alghero: the old town is charming, the beaches are stunning, the food is fantastic. Indeed, it's heartbreaking for me to divulge this information to you. The old town (centro storico) is the focal point for any visitor to Alghero, and the first view is of a red-tiled skyline, punctuated by a colourful mosaic dome and sandstone bell tower. Inside the imposing city walls, you can lose yourself among cobbled, narrow streets, small piazzas, gothic churches and pastel houses with faded shutters and wrought iron balconies covered in bright flowers. Just wandering these streets is a pleasure, especially when they are deserted during the afternoon siesta. Many different conquerors launched assaults on Alghero until the Catalans expelled everyone in 1372 and created a home away from home. From then on, the town came to be known as \"Barceloneta\", or Little Barcelona, and maintains its Catalan identity to this day. A walk around the ramparts, which protect the old town on its three seaward sides, gives you a taste of Alghero's mixed influences. Sandstone and sheer, they jut out westwards guarded by eerie watchtowers on each corner. Cafes and restaurants are dotted along the sea front. I couldn't believe my luck at getting the last outside table at Machiavelli's, from where you can watch the sun set over the distant cliffs as you feast on squid and pasta and listen to the sound of the waves. The food is unpretentious, simple but full of flavour. Seafood dominates the menu in this fishing port: lobster is heavily advertised as the local delicacy, at a hefty \u00a37 for every 100g. However, there are plenty of other affordable seafood delights that are caught locally and arrive fresh at the restaurants every day, the best being red mullet, shell-fish and squid. Seafood finds its way into pasta dishes too - bottarga (mullet roe) is the Sardinian equivalent of caviar which is grated on top of spaghetti and drizzled with olive oil. Spaghetti con vongole (with clams) and alla marinara (with seafood) are also delicious, but if you don't like seafood there are plenty of other local specialities worth trying. Culurgiones are pockets of pasta stuffed with pecorino (cheese made from ewe's milk) and ricotta and served in a tomato and mint sauce. Ravioli al sugo di noce (walnut sauce) comes a close second. It was only in the 20th century with the advent of tourism that Sardinia took to serving seafood. True Sardinians are meat lovers and are known to devour everything from roast suckling pig, wild boar, kid meat, horse and even donkey. I still don't know whether it was a wind-up when someone told me about fried and sliced calf's testicles. No matter how full you are, there is always room for seadas. This Sardinian dessert is the most delectable envelope of deep-fried pastry, stuffed with ricotta or sour cheese and drizzled with a bittersweet honey and burnt citrus peel. If that sounds too rich, try dolci sardi (Sardinian sweets and biscuits) or visit one of the many crowded gelati bars. Alghero's locally produced wines are impressive, and won't set you back any more than \u00a310. Tanca Farra is a velvety red wine from Sella &amp; Mosca, the island's biggest wine producers who also offer a cellar tour and wine-tasting session. A cheaper red option is La Bombarde, and two crisp, refreshing white wines that go well with seafood are Aragosta and Vermentino, from the island's north. From the old town, Alghero stretches north past a marina to the beach, a long strip of white sand backed by hotels that eventually peters out into sand dunes and pine groves. You can get a bus down to farther, less crowded areas, but the closest water is only a 10-minute walk. Sardinians say there are no English words to describe the hues of colour in the water. It's so clear that for the first few metres you can see every detail on the white, sandy bottom, before the water merges into a bright, sparkling turquoise ribbon and then, a deep, midnight blue. And this is only the city beach. Hire a car and drive the 45km coast road south to Bosa and around every curve in the road there is a sandy cove or rocky inlet, blue-green water, cliffs and mountains. It's hard to make any sort of progress along the road as the water is just too inviting and the cliff-top photo opportunities too many. Bosa itself is an unspoilt town, overlooked by most tourists in favour of the nearby marina and beach. A ruined castle perches on top of a hill, from which cobbled streets and quiet squares tumble down to the river, lined with huge palms and elegant mansions. The most stunning beach in this part of the island is about an hour's drive up to the north-west coast. Spiaggia della Pelosa is a dreamy crescent of white sand and sparkling emerald water that is guarded by an ancient stone watchtower. So popular is this beach that there are traffic jams of both cars and boats in peak season. Returning to Alghero via the inland route gives you a glimpse into another Sardinia, where cars stop for animals herded across the roads by old farmers, eagles circle high in the air, mangy dogs roam the streets and people chatter around water pumps. Also dotted throughout the island's interior are the ruins of over 7,000 nuraghes - mysterious conical stone towers made from roughly hewn stones. Close to Alghero is one of the island's best sites, Nuraghe di Palmavera, a 3,500-year-old village, and the Necropoli de Anghelu Ruiu, ancient burial chambers dating from 2700-3300BC. These buildings, and their coastal counterparts - massive watchtowers built at almost every port and harbour - give Sardinia an eerie echo of the past. For natural wonders however, the best day trip out from Alghero is a boat-ride to the Grotti di Nettuno (Neptune's Caves), hidden at the base of towering cliffs at the Capo Caccia peninsula. It's a three-hour round trip incorporating great views of Alghero, the local vineyards, the bay of Porto Conte and the distant hills. In the caves themselves, amazing formations have been created by stalactites and stalagmites that over millions of years have grown to meet each other. An unfortunate part of this trip is the moment when the captain motors into a cave, then clumsily reverses back out while blaring the theme from Titanic over the loudspeakers. Going to Alghero, I was keen to find anyone who had already visited Sardinia so I could ask them about it. Now that I'm back I discover that everyone has a friend who has just returned from the island, telling me \"it's the next big thing\". I only hope it's not, so that this lovely, unspoilt town can stay just the way it is. \u00b7 Ryanair flies from London Stansted to Alghero."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
