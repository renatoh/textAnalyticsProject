The 14-times major champion said in a statement posted to his website on Wednesday that he underwent fusion surgery on 19 April as a last resort and outlined a long-term prognosis he described as \u201cpositive.\u201d \u201cWe tried every possible non-surgical route and nothing worked,\u201d said Woods of the fourth procedure he\u2019s undergone on his back since 2014. \u201cI had good days and bad days, but the pain was usually there, and I couldn\u2019t do much. Even lying down hurt. I had nerve pain with anything I did and was at the end of my rope. The process leading up to my decision to have surgery was exhaustive. I consulted with a specialist, and after weighing my options, that\u2019s when I decided to go to Texas to have surgery.\u201d The 41-year-old, who in April ruled himself out of the Masters for the third time in four years, said \u201cit is hard to express how much better I feel\u201d after experiencing \u201cinstant nerve relief\u201d, adding that \u201cI haven\u2019t felt this good in years.\u201d But Woods stressed that he will not be hurrying back to the tour after a period of recovery that will see him from swinging a club for several months. \u201cI can\u2019t twist for another two and a half to three months,\u201d Woods said. \u201cRight now, my sole focus is rehab and doing what the doctors tell me. I am concentrating on short-term goals.\u201d Woods\u2019 season ended almost before it started in February, after he withdrew following a first-round 77 at an event in Dubai. That came one week after he missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open. \u201cI did everything I could to play at Augusta and was ready to go,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, it was kind of like the 2008 US Open [where Woods won despite playing with a leg fracture]. The pain was post-impact when I swung the club. I figured, \u2018Can I handle it?\u2019 This time the answer was, \u2018Probably not.\u2019 That shows the effect that nerve pain can have. Woods touched on other topics in the 986-word statement, including his charitable foundation, his recent book on his 1997 Masters breakthrough and his predicted winner for the upcoming NBA finals: the Golden State Warriors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
