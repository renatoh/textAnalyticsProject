But isn't that the point of travel - experiencing the food and drink of other cultures? And just think how good that first cup of tea will taste when you get home. David Andrews \u00b7 The Swedes are the world's largest consumers of coffee, and tea doesn't really get a look in. But, assuming you're in possession of a kettle, a mug (or cup and saucer, depending on what floats your boat) and some milk, the English Shop in S\u00f6derhallerna on Medborgarplatsen will sell you a box of PG Tips. They'll even provide you with some chocolate biscuits to complete the tea-drinking experience. Justin Steed \u00b7 Cups of tea were fairly readily available in Stockholm when we visited last July but we encountered a considerable range in prices for eating out in general. Here are some recommendations for lunches and/or tea. Don't be put off by the mention of islands as Stockholm is situated on a series of them, mostly reachable across short bridges. The Hermitage vegetarian cafe (listed in Berlitz guide as 'Herman's) is situated on Stora Nygatan on the island of Gamla Stan, the oldest area of Stockholm. This street runs parallel to the main traffic- free narrow tourist thoroughfare, and can be reached by cutting through one of the small side streets linking the two. The cafe is excellent and very cheap. Each day it offers four different vegetarian choices, which are served with as much bread and tea/coffee as you want, although we enjoyed some really good fruit juices too. Two of us ate there for a total of under \u00a312. The Modern Museet (Museum of Modern Art and Architecture) on the island of Skeppsholmen, has both a reasonable small cafe by its entrance and an excellent, though more expensive restaurant overlooking the water. The museum itself is well worth a visit. In the north of the city is Brunnsviken Lake,and we had a very pleasant walk around the edge, stopping for an excellent pot of Earl Grey at a cafe amongst the trees along the way. It was very reasonable,especially as free refills were available. Finally, we were able to make ourselves a cup of tea on returning to the hotel, (August Strinberg) where the facilities were available to guests. Judy Green \u00b7 Being of Swedish origin myself I'd say you can't really get a decent cuppa. Sweden is the land of great coffee. However, there are some fantastic cafes in Stockholm (not sure about the tea though), some to try are: Ritorno on Odenplan Cafe Madelene, by Norrmalmstorg Cafe Gra-Munken in Gamla stan Cathy Kingsbury If you have advice or questions, please email: ask.a.fellow.traveller@theguardian.com, or write to: Ask a fellow traveller, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
