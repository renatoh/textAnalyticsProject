The stakes were not as high on this occasion \u2013 two points, rather than a sudden-death play-off \u2013 but Hull KR have developed into such a solid unit that they did not even seem concerned when they fell 14-0 behind in the first 20 minutes. Blake Green, their new half-back signing from Canterbury, then scored one try and provided the final pass for another from Clint Newton, and the first of two for Ben Galea put Rovers 18-14 ahead by half-time. \"I put it down to the continuity within the squad over the last couple of years,\" said Justin Morgan, the Hull KR coach. \"We looked a bit nervous early on but they knew they could do it because they've done it before.\" Kris Welham also scored two tries at left centre, as his opposite number Tom Briscoe struggled to adjust after being switched inside from the wing. \"We came up with a couple of pretty poor individual defensive errors that frittered the lead away,\" said Hull FC's coach, Richard Agar. \"It's disappointing that after making such a good start, when the momentum went against us, we didn't ride it well enough.\" Agar hopes Richard Horne will be fit to resume his half-back partnership with Sean Long for Friday's home game against Leeds but this match provided further evidence of how much the club need to find an extra playmaker if they are to challenge Rovers for supremacy even in their own city, never mind for a first trophy since 2005."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
