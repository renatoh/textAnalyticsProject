But beyond the rainbow flag emoji, there\u2019s one art exhibition in San Diego that digs beneath the surface to shine light on what the curator calls: \u201cA minority within a minority.\u201d Opening on 29 June at the San Diego Art Institute, Forging Territories: Queer Afro and Latinx Contemporary Art showcases the works of 20 regional LGBTQ artists who have been overlooked in some way or another. \u201cIt\u2019s either overlooked or there\u2019s some kind of tokenism, it doesn\u2019t feel substantial,\u201d said the curator, Rub\u00e9n Esparza. \u201cIt\u2019s essential we get our voices out there, otherwise you don\u2019t tell the full LGBTQ story, it\u2019s only one-sided. It\u2019s the broader story of minorities we need to tell.\u201d The exhibition covers three territories: social and political issues, everyday lives and identity, to find out \u201cwho we are as black and brown people\u201d, said Esparza. It came about as an extension of the Queer Biennial, which Esparza, a Los Angeles-based Chicano artist, founded in 2012 (the biennial launches its fourth edition next summer). \u201cI started the queer biennial because we weren\u2019t seeing ourselves out there,\u201d said Esparza. \u201cExcuse my crudeness, but I just said to myself: \u2018Shut the fuck up and do something about it.\u2019 I\u2019m not one to sit back. I\u2019m not going to wait for someone to invite me to be a part of something. I\u2019m going to do it myself.\u201d The San Diego exhibit includes the works of photographer Laura Aguilar, who shows portraits of nude queer women, including herself, among nature. The artist, who passed away last year, has been noted for capturing her subjects with \u201cfrank empathy and humanism\u201d. \u201cShe celebrates people in the margins, not polished airbrushed people we see everywhere today,\u201d said Esparza. \u201cIt\u2019s her and her body and her friends, not these archetypal supermodels, there\u2019s beauty in that.\u201d \u201cShe inspired me with her diligence and despite the fact that she could barely afford to live, she made prints, editions \u2026 she never stopped making work,\u201d he adds. There\u2019s also the works of performance artist and activist Patrisse Cullors, a photographer who co-founded the Black Lives Matter movement and whose photography was crucial to include, as much of LGBT art that makes its way to the mainstream is by white men. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great art and stories to tell, we\u2019re forging that territory,\u201d said Esparza. Carlos Almaraz, a Mexican American painter who was a pioneer of the Chicano street art movement, is showing The Struggle of Mankind, a work from 1989 which shows an act of violence. There are also works by Maurice Harris, a photographer who puts black subjects alongside intricate floral arrangements. \u201cThey\u2019re a celebration of the African American diaspora,\u201d said Esparza. \u201cWhen we see people of color in the news, there\u2019s usually some kind of turmoil, but Maurice is countering that with these beautiful black folks in beautiful settings, an antidote to the poison out there.\u201d Then there\u2019s Nao Bustamante, whose work celebrates the women who fought in the Mexican Revolution from 1910 and beyond, as soldiers who fought during the civil war, as well as nurses who took care of others. \u201cIt\u2019s celebrating the women; documenting these women,\u201d said Esparza. \u201cIt\u2019s not really recorded and there were hard-hitting women from that time.\u201d The exhibition opening falls on the same week as the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, where the LGBT community fought against police raids of New York City\u2019s Stonewall Inn in 1969. However, the artists here are based in California, so there are references to historic gay activism on the west coast. That includes the Black Cat riots, where the Black Cat Tavern gay bar in Los Angeles held the country\u2019s first gay rights protest in 1967, and the rarely remembered Cooper Do-nuts riot from 1959 in Los Angeles, where the gay and trans community rioted against police harassment at a 24-hour Cooper Do-nuts cafe. \u201cI want to make sure we bring the whole spectrum and respect the people of color in the queer community, it\u2019s important to have that balance,\u201d said Esparza. \u201cOnce in a while, it\u2019s great to bring together brown and black people where people connect and see something in each other and create great friendships. These exhibitions are builders of great community. I\u2019m just doing my part to tell those stories and push those stories out.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2019 to correct a suggestion in the first paragraph that the exhibition was on display in San Francisco rather than San Diego."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
