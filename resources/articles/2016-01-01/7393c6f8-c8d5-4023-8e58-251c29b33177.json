It is still hard to work out, say, whether Louis van Gaal is the solution or the problem at Manchester United. Is this going to be Arsenal\u2019s season at long last or are Manchester City going to get their act together in time to take the title back to the north? Leicester City are not being mentioned as possible champions with quite the same earnest incredulity now they have been knocked off top spot but can they keep up enough momentum to make it into the Champions League? And is Chelsea\u2019s decline terminal or will there be a swift ascent of the table under Guus Hiddink now that John Terry has admitted the team has recovered its memory of how to play? All these questions and more, including whether J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Sam Allardyce are going to live up to their reputations as saviours at Liverpool and Sunderland, and whether Steve McClaren, Alan Curtis and R\u00e9mi Garde are going to have time to make reputations for themselves before the relegation net closes in, should start to be resolved in the next month. There are FA Cup weekends at the beginning and the end of January but three full rounds of Premier League fixtures in between, beginning with some extremely tasty games in the next few days. By the end of the month the overall picture should be much clearer. It is even possible a semblance of normality may have returned. The poor old FA Cup has been rather overshadowed by the round of midweek league games that follows so shortly in its wake. Anyone who imagines this is accidental, and not deliberate policy on the part of the Premier League, has clearly not been paying attention. If there is a space the Premier League can occupy to ensure even higher visibility than before, any greensward of tradition that can be trampled over, Richard Scudamore and his team are ready to pull on their boots. Of course the FA Cup has been devalued but it is not Scudamore\u2019s job to worry about it. No one else does, apart from broadcasters tasked with polishing it up and presenting it to a sceptical public as if it were the sporting equivalent of Aladdin\u2019s lamp. The magic, or at least all the gold and gleaming riches, are in the Premier League now, and it was not difficult to sympathise with Allardyce when he insisted Sunderland\u2019s game at Swansea on Wednesday had to be his priority. A glance at the table shows why. Sunderland are in the bottom three and would stay there even with a victory in Wales. But lose that game and Swansea, one of the two or three sides Allardyce might hope to climb above eventually to survive, would open a seven-point gap and Sunderland would begin to look stranded. For exactly the same reasons Swansea have to be looking at taking three points from opponents beneath them in the table. It would not be an exaggeration to suggest Curtis\u2019s first league game since being confirmed as Swansea\u2019s manager for the rest of the season could hold the key to all that follows. This week also brings Newcastle against Manchester United, always a tough game whatever the situations of the participants, and this time undoubtedly a pointer to McClaren\u2019s future on Tyneside. Van Gaal\u2019s United have to be regarded as beatable \u2013 perhaps not easy to beat, not exactly there for the taking, but nothing to be frightened of either. Newcastle showed their resolve with huge results against Liverpool and Spurs before Christmas, only to falter against Aston Villa and West Bromwich. If McClaren is looking for a statement result to set up the second half of the season, this could be his opportunity. What Van Gaal is looking for is less clear but with an away game at Liverpool to follow next weekend he will be hoping to avoid any more crisis management. Before Liverpool get to play Manchester United they take on Arsenal on Wednesday. Given Klopp\u2019s well-publicised injury problems, the league leaders might feel this is a good time to visit, though assuming Liverpool can raise a team, their record against top sides under their new manager is encouraging. Perhaps wins against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea ought to be regarded as devalued currency \u2013 something one would not have envisaged saying a few months ago \u2013 but the manner in which Liverpool demolished Manchester City in November rightly had people talking of a title challenge. Tottenham are now regarded as the best outside chance, along with Leicester, and the sides with the fewest defeats meet at White Hart Lane on Wednesday in a game that could establish which of the pretenders keeps up the challenge longest. Also this month Stoke v Arsenal is every neutral\u2019s favourite game and Arsenal v Chelsea can hardly fail to be significant. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, having broken his duck against Mourinho in the Community Shield, knows he will have to carry round his woeful league record against his arch-antagonist for the rest of his days, though a victory against Hiddink\u2019s Chelsea would go a long way to help compensate. If Arsenal can come through against Liverpool, Stoke and Chelsea, people will have to stop making jokes about their ability to stay on top of the table. They do not have to travel to Manchester City until May so their best plan might be to try to put some distance between the two clubs by then. While this will be their most demanding month, January is not just about top-of-the-table issues. What about Aston Villa v Leicester next weekend, or Swansea v Watford? Villa and Swansea might have had those down as winnable games at the start of the season. Sunderland would definitely have fancied their chances against Bournemouth five months ago, little knowing that the Cherries would embarrass Chelsea and Manchester United before long, not to mention the mid-September 2-0 victory that played its part in Dick Advocaat\u2019s departure a couple of weeks later. Now, 23 January pits Big Sam against Plucky Eddie, pragmatism v romance, world-weariness in one corner, heart-warming optimism in the other. The manager no one thought would go down taking on the one no one thought could stay up. With due respect to the FA Cup\u2019s unofficial new slogan, it is the Premier League where anything can happen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
