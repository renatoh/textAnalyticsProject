Fifty years later, as he lay dying in hospital, he was still working hard, determined to come up with his theory of everything. By this time the scientific community regarded him as a bit of a has-been. Other physicists were too busy wrestling with quantum mechanics, which Einstein inspired, but they could understand why he detested it so. This elegant, intelligent film reconstructs Einstein's final days and recalls the time when science was popular enough for Selfridges to displays Einstein's theories in its shop windows. Sweeney Investigates 9.50pm, BBC2 If you ask most Chelsea fans where they think Roman Abramovich got his billions, they'll either shrug or wink. He's Russian, the country's been ruled by gangsters since the fall of communism, so put two and two together, right? However, as John Sweeney explains, nothing is ever so clear cut in Russia. His riveting examination of the post-communist oligarchy, of which Abramovich is a member, shows what happens when an enormous country full of natural resources stumbles into rough capitalism. Sweeney can't reveal what lies behind Abramovich's curiously blank face, but he does show how you can make billions when a rich country sells itself cheaply. Cocaine 10pm, Channel 4 Z\u00e9 lives in one of Rio de Janeiro's slums and earns \u00a3140 a month by working two menial jobs. When he was a member of the slum's drug gang, though, he would make up to \u00a3400 a day selling drugs. Now he's trying to get his 19-year-old nephew Leo out of the gang before Leo ends up dead, just as his father did. It's quite chilling to watch the gang members - who all look barely 20 - playing with their guns and casually showing off their power over the people in the slum. It's even more frightening watching the police raid the slum, firing into streets where children are riding their bicycles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
