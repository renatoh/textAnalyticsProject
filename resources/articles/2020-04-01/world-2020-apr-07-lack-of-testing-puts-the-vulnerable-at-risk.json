We cared for him at home until the morning before he died, which was in the local hospital. The only reason he was tested was that he was going into hospital \u2013 no community testing was available. In the two weeks before he died at least six different healthcare professionals came into the house \u2013 district nurses, out-of-hours doctors and a palliative care nurse. Because he did not get a test until his last day, despite having some symptoms, these healthcare staff had minimal personal protective equipment\u2013 basic mask, apron and gloves. These exposed staff are not being traced, tested or quarantined, so could well be spreading the virus to their families and other patients within the community. The lack of testing, tracing, quarantine and proper PPE is extremely worrying. It is not enough to wait for symptoms to appear before NHS staff self-isolate. We need a proper approach to managing care within the community and protecting staff and patients, or the virus will continue to spread to the most vulnerable cared-for people in our communities.
