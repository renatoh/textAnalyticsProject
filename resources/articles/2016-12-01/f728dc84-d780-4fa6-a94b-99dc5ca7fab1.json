Former hedge fund manager Shkreli last year bought Turing Pharmaceuticals and almost immediately increased the price of the drug \u2013 which has been off-patent since the 1970s \u2013 from US$13.50 to US$750 a tablet. The drug is used to treat certain types of malaria as well as toxoplasmosis, a rare and life-threatening infection caused by the Toxoplasma parasite which particularly affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV. To show how exorbitant Shkreli\u2019s pricing of the drug was, a group of year 11 students aged 16 and 17 from Sydney Grammar aimed to recreate the drug molecule in their school laboratory under the guidance of Dr Alice Williamson and Associate Professor Matthew Todd from the Open Source Malaria consortium. They succeeded, making the drug for a mere $2 a pill. The story went global overnight, with headlines such as \u201cHigh schoolers punch Martin Shkreli in the face, figuratively\u201d in Forbes and \u201cSydney high school students \u2018show up\u2019 Martin Shkreli\u201d in the Washington Post. On Twitter Shkreli dismissed what the students achieved, saying \u201chow is that showing anyone up? Almost any drug can be made at small scale for a low price\u201d. One of the students, Leonard Milan, told Guardian Australia that Shkreli \u201csaying to us that anyone could do what we could do is certainly true\u201d. \u201cIf you follow his overpriced method using toxic chemicals in an industrial lab it\u2019s easy,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cBut the fact that we were able to substitute some really toxic gasses with simple school-available chemicals and do it so cheaply demonstrates the absurdity of some of his justifications for the price. \u201cI think Martin is an attention-seeking businessman, the way he responds to every Twitter post made threatening him, bragging about how he can do whatever he wants reflects this. \u201cWhilst there are mitigating factors, namely the percentage of returns he puts back into research and development, I think he has made it a personal matter. If he were to get \u2018pushed around\u2019 by schoolkids, it\u2019d be a bad look. \u201cI feel like Martin can forget that there are people\u2019s lives and livelihoods at stake.\u201d Williamson told Guardian Australia that showing how cheap and easy the drug was to produce was part of the point of the project, as it highlighted how unfair Shkreli\u2019s pricing of the drug was. She refused to weigh into Shkreli\u2019s Twitter tirade, saying only: \u201cI like to let the work speak for itself.\u201d Shkreli later posted a video to Twitter boasting of his own achievements when he was younger. He also reminded Twitter users that \u201cI have patents and stuff\u201d. He later tweeted that \u201clab scale manufacturing\u201d and \u201cmanufacturing costs millions to maintain\u201d. The students were undeterred by Shkreli\u2019s comments, telling Guardian Australia the project had instilled a passion in them for science. \u201cIt has made me want to do a science degree,\u201d James Wood said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
