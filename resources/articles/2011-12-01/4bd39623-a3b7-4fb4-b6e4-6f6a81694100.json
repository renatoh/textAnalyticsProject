But the best, relatively speaking, has been saved for last. Scouse soul-popper Ferguson, 2010's runner-up, has been spared the generic ballad/urban treatment and allowed to go her own retro-soul way, a move that makes the most of her rich, emotive voice. The usual sidemen, including Cardle co-composer Eg White, are on board, but have come up with 10 atypically direct, unembellished R&amp;B/soul tracks. The gospelish wails on the single Nothing's Real but Love are as over-dramatised as things get; otherwise, Ferguson keeps things simple and open-hearted. She's believably peppery on the goodbye-to-love song Fairytale, with its Muscle Shoals overtones, while her delight at meeting \"the one\" feels real on Mr Bright Eyes. The obvious comparison is Adele: Ferguson is no innovator, but her voice makes the world a slightly nicer place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
