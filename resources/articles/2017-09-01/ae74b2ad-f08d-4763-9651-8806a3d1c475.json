The former president announced plans on Wednesday to host a summit of young leaders in Chicago, designed to boost civic engagement and expand opportunities for young people both in the US and abroad. Obama unveiled the two-day Obama Foundation Summit, which will also feature Michelle Obama, in a video message that drew upon familiar themes of enacting change from the outside. \u201cWe want to lift up the amazing work that organizers, inventors, artists, entrepreneurs, journalists and others are doing,\u201d Obama said, speaking directly to the camera. \u201cAnd if we do it right, together we\u2019ll show the world that each of us has a role to play in our civic life.\u201d The summit will be hosted in Obama\u2019s hometown at the end of October. The foundation also announced a two-year fellowship program focused on training and development for \u201ccivic innovators\u201d. Although there was no mention of Trump, consistent with Obama\u2019s reluctance since leaving office in January to criticize him by name,Obama gave a nod to the political climate in a written statement. \u201cDemocracy is a job for all of us. What are you going to do about it?\u201d Obama wrote in an email to the foundation\u2019s supporters. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more certain that we\u2019ll rise to the occasion \u2013 together. \u201cWhen I left office in January, I asked of you the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me back in 2008. I asked you to believe \u2013 not in my ability to bring about change, but in yours.\u201d Obama has kept a low profile since handing Trump the keys to the White House, choosing to weigh in on only a handful of issues. He issued statements on Trump\u2019s travel ban, America\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and, most recently, Trump\u2019s decision to tear up protections for roughly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. Obama\u2019s most political comments so far came as Republicans attempted to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, his signature legislative accomplishment that has expanded access to healthcare to nearly 22 million Americans. While accepting the John F Kennedy Library Foundation\u2019s Profile in Courage award in May, Obama implored lawmakers to show the \u201ccourage to champion the vulnerable and the sick and the infirm\u201d. David Simas, the CEO of the Obama Foundation, said: \u201cFrom leaders who are already making an impact, to people who are interested in becoming more involved, but don\u2019t know where to start, our goal is to make our programs accessible to anyone, anywhere, with any background or level of experience. \u201cThis is only the beginning \u2013 our programs will grow as we continue to listen and learn.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
