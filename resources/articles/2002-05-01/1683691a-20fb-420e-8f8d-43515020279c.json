I was involved in such a programme at a large comprehensive school and sixth form centre in Weston-Super-Mare, between 1971 and 1986. It was considered a success by pupils and teachers. We called our programme \"Personal and social relationships\", and the aim was to help the pupils' personal development. Groups of pupils discussed their feelings with each other about a whole range of issues such as parenting, drugs, relationships, racism - all introduced by their own teacher/facilitator. The pupils taught and healed each other through exchanging feelings and values, while the teacher \"held the ring\". The groups were made up of boys and girls and a mixture of high and low achievers, and they sat in circles, not at desks; the pupils did the talking, not the teacher. The groups were kept compact, and therefore intimate, at 16 pupils. Classes of 25 or more destroy interest and trust. Twenty teachers were involved out of a staff of a hundred, and each took one or more groups as part of their ordinary teaching schedule, having had in-house training in basic listening skills. For the first time in their lives in many cases, pupils had regular weekly opportunities to face up to themselves and each other, to recognise the hurt they could do - or the good. As time went by the sharing produced trust, far greater self-knowledge, self-esteem and respect for other people. They learned what was important to them, what was truly worthwhile and they developed hitherto unknown strengths. This enabled them to exercise self-control when corrupting and potentially damaging influences came their way, in school or elsewhere, and so gave them a better chance of achieving worthwhile goals. As a staff we were delighted with these lessons, and the pupils said there should be far more of them. They claimed they were able to attend to their ordinary lessons far better, since much personal anxiety had been resolved. To work, such a scheme has to be given the necessary priority in the curriculum; and to be set up in the first place, it needs the political will. Our headmaster, Michael Hinton, made it so. It seems rather useless to continue with the sort of education, both here and overseas, which results in a low ceiling of intelligence, lack of compassion, and an inability to cooperate. Human beings can do so much better. The general public has to be made aware of the enormous power dormant in our children for helping each other to develop a huge increase in compassion and thence wisdom. An informed national debate might stand the chance of sanctioning education to release this unlimited potential."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
