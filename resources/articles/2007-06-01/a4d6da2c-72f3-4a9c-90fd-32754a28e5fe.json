It was the second attack in 15 months on the Askariya mosque, 60 miles north of Baghdad; its famous gilded dome was destroyed by a bomb in February 2006. Nobody was killed in that bombing, but it generated a ruinous wave of sectarian bloodletting which dented hopes for national reconciliation. Details of yesterday's attack were sketchy last night. Iraqi police said two explosions came from inside the mosque at 9am. Other reports said the mosque's two minarets were toppled by rockets. There were no casualties reported, but the political reverberations could be damaging. The Askariya shrine contains the tombs of two 9th century imams considered by Shia to be the direct successors of the Prophet Muhammad. A smaller dome nearby covers the cleft from where the 12th imam is expected to reappear to establish the true faith on Earth. Prime minister Nuri al-Maliki held emergency meetings with President Jalal Talabani, General David Petraeus, the senior US commander in Iraq, and Ryan Crocker, the US ambassador. He ordered an indefinite curfew in Baghdad as US and Iraqi troop reinforcements were dispatched to Samarra. \"I am sure these people will not stop doing such acts, and they will try to create more problems and spark more violence,\" Mr Maliki said in an address on state TV. He had ordered the arrest of those in charge of security at the mosque, he said, and he vowed to \"severely punish anyone involved in the bombing\". Curfews were in place in a number of Shia cities in the south last night to prevent unrest. Iraq's pre-eminent Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, swiftly released a statement expressing his outrage, but urging believers \"to exercise self-restraint and avoid any vengeful act that would target innocent people or the holy places of others\". Senior Sunni groups, including the Association of Muslim Clerics, also quickly condemned the explosions. Despite the appeals for calm, police in Baghdad said last night at least four Sunni mosques had been attacked by arsonists and bombers, while a smaller Shia shrine had been bombed north of the capital. There was also growing anger among Shia ranks at the failure of the government of Mr Maliki and its US backers to safeguard one of Shia Islam's most sacred sites. The powerful Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr railed against the occupation, and called for peaceful demonstrations and three days of mourning to mark the shrine's destruction. His political bloc, a main plank in Mr Maliki's ruling Shia alliance, announced its withdrawal from the parliament in protest. A few hundred US soldiers are stationed around the mainly Sunni city of Samarra, 60 miles north of Baghdad, to provide security, although they leave the protection of the Askariya mosque to Iraqi forces. A Sadrist MP, Salah Shansel, said that his bloc had approached Mr Maliki six months ago to discuss their concerns for security in Samarra. He said the Sadrist bloc would not return to the fold until the government promised to rebuild the shrine and strengthen security at holy sites. The American authorities in Iraq blamed the attack on al-Qaida."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
