Archer, 24, played three times for West Indies Under-19s in 2013 before moving to England and \u2013 following a change in regulations that required just three years of residency to qualify for selection \u2013 breaking into the senior side this summer. The Barbados-born fast bowler, who has only ever held a British passport, described the fixture in Southampton as \u201cjust another game\u201d following this three-wicket burst against Bangladesh last Saturday. But for all this talk, Morgan has acknowledged that it will indeed have additional meaning. \u201cI think it is a moment where you reaffirm your decision,\u201d said Morgan, who turned out 23 times for Ireland before switching nationality in 2009 and then returning to Clontarf for a one-dayer a few years later. \u201cThe difference is the feel. When you play against guys that you\u2019ve played with at age-group level, it felt like a club game against your mates you\u2019ve known for a long time, compared to playing against strangers \u2013 that\u2019s the different feel. \u201cJofra won\u2019t know how it will feel until he plays the game. I think being in that position myself, it does feel different the first time you play against a side that either you could have potentially played for or played against. But I\u2019m sure he will handle it like he\u2019s handled everything else so far.\u201d Jason Holder, the West Indies captain, said Archer\u2019s impressive start to life in an England shirt comes as no surprise, having watched his progress at club level in Barbados. He described his decision to play for England as \u201cunfortunate\u201d but when asked if he would make the current West Indies, the all-rounder looked to shoulder arms. Holder replied: \u201cHe\u2019s English. It is something I can\u2019t control. So I\u2019m not going to worry about it. I\u2019m not going to get flustered over it. Our role in this World Cup is to play against England in this game and our role is to beat England.\u201d He hopes it will be England who are flustered come match day, not least if Chris Gayle can repeat the six-hitting spree witnessed during the winter when, during a 2-2 series draw, he cleared the ropes two more times than the opponents combined with 39 such blows. Morgan is not the type to betray any on-field concern, of course, with the England captain explaining his method. \u201cIn the West Indies Gayle played extremely well but for a long part of his innings he didn\u2019t go at more than a run a ball. When guys are doing that, it\u2019s not necessarily hurting you as a team. \u201cWhen he hits three sixes in a row it might not feel like that, with the crowd going bananas. But you look at the scoreboard and think, does it reflect the game? Having a scoreboard with lots of detail is an advantage.\u201d Morgan could be without one of his trump cards in Mark Wood, the fast bowler facing a fitness test after some bruising to an ankle that is seemingly not serious. With much of the focus on England\u2019s pace of late, the England captain was keen that other members of the attack get their dues. He added: \u201cThe previous two years Chris Woakes has been the best seam bowler in the world in the first 10 overs and no one has mentioned that. It\u2019s unbelievable, his control with the new ball. I hope it continues. \u201cLiam Plunkett is the same, in the middle overs he\u2019s the leading wicket-taker and if that was a spinner you\u2019d be shouting from the rooftops. The key is knowing their roles and feeling valued by the whole dressing room.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
