She won't let us draw the curtains in her room and wants the light left on and the door left open. None of this is a problem in itself, but then the light or noise actually stops her getting to sleep. We've got (from one of your previous columns) the light that fades gradually and it's brilliant, but the plug in her room is quite far from her bed and we don't want to have trailing wires. We're not sure what we're after but some help or advice on things to stop her being afraid of the dark or to get her over this stage? As it is, bedtime is long-winded and fractious and she wakes about four or five times a night. Mr and Mrs Almeida, Manchester This isn't at all uncommon at this age. A mother I know gave me the most brilliant advice about monsters which is not to deny that they are there, so don't say, \"Don't be silly, darling, there's nothing there\", or tell them monsters are nothing to be scared of. To them the monsters are there and they are scared of them. What she suggested, and it works brilliantly for us, is to acknowledge your child thinks there are monsters behind the curtains and deal with them. So when my daughter says, \"Mummy, monsters at the window\", what I do is pull back the curtains and say, \"Come on, monster, shoo shoo\" and then I shoo the monster(s), with great ceremony and noise, until it is out of her room and then I escort him to the front door, open it, say \"shoo, monster\" one final time and then shut the door. For us, this works fantastically well. The monster may come back the next night, but after I have shooed him away she has accepted he is gone for the night. And it has the added advantage of making me look like Super Mum, what with being able to deal with monsters and all. For those of you who missed my mention of the Auto Fade Bedside Light, \u00a319.99, code 5050 (bloomingmarvellous.co.uk, 0845 4587407), it is indeed brilliant. It has a dimmer button so you can have it nice and bright, to read by, or so soft it's like a night light. By pressing the top button you can set it to fade automatically over up to 15 minutes (depending on how bright it was to begin with). You're right to say that having the lights on will stop her sleeping, or at least not facilitate it (light prevents the production of the sleep hormone melatonin). Although, that said, children are remarkably able to sleep through bright lights and lots of noise if they want to. I'm sure you've looked at reasons why she may suddenly have \"got scared\" or reluctant to go to bed (new sibling, new bed, moved house, new playschool or carer? All could unsettle her, although sometimes it's just \"one of those things\", to give it its scientific name). A quite brilliant product is the Candeloo Kids Light, \u00a350 inclusive of p&amp;p from Baby Bean (baby-bean.co.uk, 01535 644800). These are a pair of rechargeable lights that look like slugs' heads, and come in red/pink or green/blue. They charge by sitting on a stand and when you need to use them you take them off the stand (you can also switch them on and off independently). They're totally wire-free and stay cool to the touch, so can travel with you around the house - even outside - and give about eight hours of light (note it's a very low light, not really bright enough to read from) before they need recharging. My daughter has been known to go to bed with her one. You could also use the spa lights I recommended in the December 23 column (from \u00a36.95, from firebox.com) as night lights in her room. A good bedtime routine can give reassurance in times of uncertainty. I'm a huge fan of Dr Seuss and in that series there is a wonderful bedtime book called The Sleep Book, \u00a34.99. The key, I find, is to get a book that has no scary bits at all (this is harder than you think, as children can find all sorts of things scary), and is also a good length. Otherwise they're just starting to lull off and the book finishes! Completely contradicting the \"length\" thing but a book that's so wonderful I have to recommend it (start bedtime with it) is Elephant Elements (Pittau/Gervais, published by Pavilion). Finally, as a way of calming her before bedtime try some relaxing CDs made especially for children. Relax Kids (relaxkids.com, 01865 893 332) has six themed CDs, \u00a314.99 (Wizard, Princess, Superheroes, Nature, Quiet Spaces, Shining Stars) so for example the wizard-themed one uses wizard imagery to help children relax. Feel Good Friends (feelgoodfriends.com, 020-8854 7767) has a CD called Feel Good Journeys, \u00a312.99, which features four relaxation \"journeys\" (floating on a cloud, flying through the sky, which I rather fancy ... ) using creative visualisation and breathing techniques to help relax little ones.
