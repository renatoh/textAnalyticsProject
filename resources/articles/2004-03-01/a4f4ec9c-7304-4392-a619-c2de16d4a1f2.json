He clearly has more faith in Hoggard's batting ability than I do. A no-ball prolongs the agony, but to Hoggard's credit he survives and that is tea. This game is exquisitely poised. England trail by 18 with three wickets in hand. Join me at 8.35pm GMT for the final session. \"Take Paul Headon's advice and don't print any such tempt-fating emails,\" writes a despondent Matthew Cobb. \"However, I'm neither a West Indian nor a Yorkshireman, but a time-wasting intellectual currently living five minutes' bike ride from Old Trafford. And I should know better than to tempt fate as I'm a Manchester City fan. Gloom and despondency will reign until the Medoc kicks in. Can't stand Revels, myself. Are jokelhlaups related to drumlins by any chance? (Who could resist physical geography with things like drumlins in it? You should know, Larry, Chesh-shire is littered with them.)\" Hey, I'm a City fan too. Here's to a glorious defeat in tomorrow's derby. 87th over: England 291-7 (Giles 10, Hoggard 4) A no-ball from Sanford takes extras to 53. A bye next ball takes it to 54. Will the Windies live to regret their generosity, I wonder. Hoggard is left to negotiate three deliveries, which he just about manages. One more over to go before tea. \"Wondering if I'm the only non-student also stuck at their desk tonight rather than going out on the town,\" writes Hana Loftus. \"Writing some briefing notes on utopian greenbelt communities in Essex, in case you were wondering. Of which there are a surprising number. I know this sounds like a poor excuse for a PhD, but really, it's all in the good cause of urban regeneration.\" We believe you, Hana. 86th over: England 289-7 (Giles 10, Hoggard 4) Hoggard can't do much about a series of short-pitched deliveries from Best that whistle past his lughole outside off. The fourth is a yorker which Hoggard just manages to dig out. Classic fast bowling: bouncer, bouncer, bouncer, yorker. Hoggard gets behind the fifth ball, then squirts the sixth to third man for two, very welcome, runs. \"I have a bet with my work colleagues that this game will be finished by the time Monday morning comes around,\" weites Matthew Wassell, \"so it's good to see England trying to help me out by throwing their wickets away! The money is as good as mine!\" I wouldn't be so sure, Matthew. We're not even into the third innings yet. 85th over: England 287-7 (Giles 10, Hoggard 2) Sanford to Hoggard, which doesn't inspire...eh? Oh. Four slips lie in etc but Hoggard's etc and somehow etc to pinch an etc to square-leg. Etc is down to 24. 84th over: England 286-7 (Giles 10, Hoggard 1) Best to Hoggard, which doesn't inspire confidence. Five slips lie in wait, but Hoggard's having none of it, and somehows gets bat on ball to pinch a single to fine leg. The deficit is down to 25. 83rd over: England 285-7 (Giles 10, Hoggard 0) Sanford is given the new ball ahead of Collymore, which raises my eyebrows. Giles has a swish at his third ball, but misses. He then has a swipe at his fourth ball. And misses. He then has a swipe at his fifth ball. Guess what? It goes for four through point. Shot! \"I really hope you're not right, Stephen Follows,\" writes a worried Amy Jackson, \"or my thesis is going to get the full \"Jack Lee\" treatment. They're big, dirty, glacial floods, brought about by a break in a lake or volcanic activity under a glacier.\" 82nd over: England 281-7 (Giles 6, Hoggard 0) This game is ebbing and flowing quite beautifully. Giles works Best to deep midwicket for two, then runs a single to third man, thus exposing Matthew Hoggard, who has surprisingly come in at No9 ahead of Simon Jones. Must be a case of pulling rank, because Jones is the better batsman in my book. Hoggard does well to fend off the last ball of the over into the gully. WICKET! Read c Hinds b Best 20 (278-7) Another brainstorm from an England batsman! Read flaps bizarrely at Tino Best's first delivery with the second new ball and provides Ryan Hinds at midwicket with the simplest of catches. Did I say I despaired earlier? Well I do now! 81st over: England 278-6 (Read 20, Giles 3) Well, miracles do happen. Sarwan has been given another over with the old ball - and it's a maiden to Giles. New ball now, perhaps? \"I'll have to try these Revels sometime,\" says Richard Porter. \"You got my interest aroused, but I headed to the university library vending machine, and they don't stock Revels, so for now I must make do with a Nestle Double Cream. But tomorrow, tomorrow I shall try Revels, yes I will.\" Easy as she goes, Richard. 80th over: England 278-6 (Read 20, Giles 3) Barring miracles, this will be the last over with the old ball - the West Indies ploy of hurrying through some overs with the part-timers has worked a treat, as Flintoff will testify. Giles drives a single through extra-cover, and England trail by 33. \"Perhaps Amy could cheer you up by telling you all about those jokelhlaups,\" suggests Stephen Follows. \"I envisage a band of heavy-footed but cheeky dwarves, living somewhere north-west of Stockholm, who entertain the locals every Candlemas with their earthy banter. Am I right?\" 79th over: England 277-6 (Read 20, Giles 2) Sarwan continues to Giles, who pokes his second ball into the vacant gully region for one run. Read is then gifted two runs by Lara, who lets a gentle cut dribble through his legs at backward point. \"Is Matthew Cobb a West Indian, or perhaps a Yorkshireman?\" wonders Paul Headon. \"I've never seen such a blatant piece of fate-tempting in my life - I'm amazed Fate was lured by that one. Please don't print any more emails of such a desperately dangerous nature!\" With pleasure, Paul. With pleasure. 78th over: England 274-6 (Read 18, Giles 1) Hinds gets a bit of turn there as Read plays and misses. Giles had the perfect view of that one from the non-striker's end, and he'll have enjoyed what he saw. Read pinches one more into the covers, but the game has gone quiet following the cringeworthy demise of Flintoff. Giles gets going with a push for one to cover. \"Freddie!\" echoes Matthew Cobb, moments after cheering him on. \"I think I'll go and get on the outside of a bottle of Medoc instead.\" 77th over: England 272-6 (Read 17, Giles 0) That, incidentally, was Sarwan's 10th Test wicket. The previous nine had cost him 55.66 apiece. Read picks up another single with a dab into the covers. 76th over: England 271-6 (Read 16, Giles 0) Read sweeps Hinds from outside off-stump for two runs, then plays more of a paddle sweep for a single to square-leg. \"Don't think I've ever eaten Revels,\" admits Richard Porter. \"I presume they're some kind of sweets? Are they nice?\" They're delicious, Richard. Especially the orange ones. 75th over: England 268-6 (Read 13, Giles 0) I'm still too upset to write anything. WICKET! Flintoff c Hinds b Sarwan 46 (268-6) I despair. Sarwan comes on to bowl his rusty legbreaks and good old Freddie just can't resist a heave, can he? With a half-century there for the taking - and at a crucial moment of the game - he smears him straight to midwicket, where Hinds takes the catch high to his right. FREDDIE!!! 74th over: England 266-5 (Flintoff 44, Read 13) Hinds goes over the wicket to Flintoff - West Indies are just trying to get through some quiet overs here before the second new ball becomes available. The plan works there - just a single to Flintoff. \"Just to prove us time-wasting intellectuals are also interested in the game (unlike the posh darts-farts): GO FLINTOFF!\" screams Matthew Cobb. \"My evening will be spent reading about the man who invented gin, who has a minor part in a book I'm trying to write which Alison Jeeves may scoff about, but which I predict she will inadvertently end up buying at an airport bookshop some time in late 2005.\" The gauntlets have been been thrown down. 73rd over: England 265-5 (Flintoff 43, Read 13) Sanford surprises Flintoff with a bit of extra bounce there as the ball rears off a length, takes the bat handle, and bounces two yards in front of second slip. Flintoff's answer is a crashing straight-drive to the on-side of the stumps that goes for four, even on this sluggish outfield. He takes a single through midwicket next ball. The new ball is available shortly, which is when batting is at its toughest on this pitch. 72nd over: England 260-5 (Flintoff 38, Read 13) Brian Lara is back on the field, and about time too - the Windies bowling has been ragged since the resumption. The ball is immediately thrown to Ryan Hinds, who bowls friendly left-arm spin. Read cuts him late for three, and Flintoff works a single to midwicket. \"Well truth be told I've achieved sod all today,\" writes Liam Drew. \"Damian and I are off to the pub now for a quickie before the romance begins. Let's hope Flintoff smacks this maniac Best all over the ground.\" 71st over: England 256-5 (Flintoff 37, Read 11) Flintoff brings up the 250 with two well-placed runs through the covers off Sanford. A single to backward point follows, before Read tucks Sanford off his hip to backward square for one more. Flintoff squirts another single to third man, and Read pulls for yet another. Flintoff completes an excellent over for England with a pull for two. They score off every ball in that over. Like England, Amy Jackson is flying. \"This evening I will mostly be writing about jokelhlaups,\" she informs us, \"trying not to check the cricket commentary every five minutes and eating Revels, trying to avoid the orange and coffee ones. This is proving to be very tricky - could have sworn one was a toffee one and got horrid surprise when it was coffee. Does anyone like orange and coffee Revels or do they just put them in to keep people on their toes?\" I like orange, but don't like coffee, if that helps. 70th over: England 248-5 (Flintoff 31, Read 9) Flintoff picks up two more as Best serves up a help-yourself full-toss on his pads, and then chips a leg-stump half-volley over wide mid-on for four. He's starting to get into the groove. A single to deep square follows, and the West Indies bowlers are just starting to lose their way again. These two have now added 39 in 40 balls. Good stuff. Here's Steve Hart with the latest odds: \"10/3 West Indies, 1/2 Draw, 4/1 England.\" I reckon 4/1 isn't a bad price... 69th over: England 240-5 (Flintoff 24, Read 9) Sanford begins with a yorker which Flintoff does well to keep out. But he then strays onto Flintoff's pads - that's four leg-byes to long leg, taking extras to 50. A round of applause, if you please. And there's more cheering as Flintoff pulls the next ball for four. Poor bowling from Sanford, who then drops short once more and is pulled for two! The last ball elicits a big shout for leg-before as Flintoff tries to pull a ball that was too close to him - too high, perhaps. Still, 10 off the over. Here's Rory. \"Andrew Losowsky - let us know on tomorrow\u00b4s commentary whether the Bongolian was any good. He\u00b4s playing in my local in Lleida tomorrow night.\" 68th over: England 230-5 (Flintoff 18, Read 9) Flintoff squirts Best's first ball backward of point for another single - he's playing responsibly at the moment. Read is just playing himself in. Best is still pulling improbable faces. Amy Jackson has mixed feelings about all the advice she's been getting from fellow readers about her PhD. \"Jack Lee's point b) made me go hot and cold all over, it being a recurring nightmare I've been having for the last six months. And my thesis must be almost exactly the same length as Lian Drew, taken pretty much the same amount of time to write up and we're finishing at the same time, what are the chances of that, eh? Feel slightly less isolated in my thesis trauma now, but slightly more anxious after Jack Lee. Any regrets, Jack? And just out of interest, in which subject can you talk your examiners round from a fail to a pass? Should've done that subject, whatever it is.\" 67th over: England 229-5 (Flintoff 17, Read 9) The military medium Adam Sanford takes up the attack following an hour's break for rain, and passes Flintoff's inside edge with his second delivery. From his fourth, Flintoff stands up tall and pushes a single to third man. One off the over. \"Just thought I'd check in with the other time-wasting intellectuals,\" writes Damian Pattinson. \"I've been writing up for four months now, Amy, and still haven't even cracked a first draft. Not sure about the six months of 'very hard work', Liam- I seem to remember you coming into work yesterday at about 12, playing football for an hour and being in the pub by 5.\" Ouch. 6.44pm Right, here we go. England 228 for 5, and the sun is shining. Settle back and enjoy... 6.41pm I think we're going to get some cricket. In about five minutes' time. Hurrah! 6.40pm All these rain breaks favour the Windies. The batsmen have to continually play themselves in, while the bowlers get to recharge those batteries the commentators always refer to. I'm sure I made this point yesterday, but there's a limit to the amount of original points you can make when rain stops play. \"Am going to see a British funkmeister called The Bongolian tonight,\" writes Andrew Losowsky in Barcelona. \"Doors open at midnight, which is slightly worrying as the cricket season here kicks off tomorrow morning at 10 am and I still haven't met any of the rest of my team yet. I'm not sure I'll make such a good impression.\" 6.35pm I fear it could be one of those on-off days. Fewer than 18 overs have been bowled today, with England losing 2 for 74. Fact. \"Surprise evening being lined up by my girlfriend, meeting her in the Tate Modern later,\" reports Liam Drew. And they say romance is dead! 6.31pm The covers are coming off! 6.30pm The sun is reputed to be shining over Sabina Park. Now they just have to mop up all the moisture on the covers. Matt Parsons thinks he knows what's going on. \"The brand new Cricket 2004 from EA is a fantastic game,\" he says. \"Unfortunately it has a bizarre bug in the weather code, whereby if it rains in a West Indies Test series, it doesn't stop. In fact, it keeps on raining forever until you switch off the PC, thus losing whatever valuable work you took a 'short break' from. Are we witnessing the first crossover from computer gaming to reality? And where is the power switch?\" 6.25pm Hmm. Not a lot to report here. And your emails seem to have dried up, which is hardly surprising really. Looks like it could be another long evening. Anyone doing anything fun tonight? 6.20pm Actually, it's still raining. 6.10pm Apparently the rain has stopped. \"Well as long as the poem takes more than three days to write, I'd be happy,\" says Liam Drew. \"And perhaps if they (Allen or Jack) had to spend ages formatting it so that it printed nicely, I'd be even happier.\" I'll see what I can do, Liam. 6.05pm And the rain kept falling. \"Crikey,\" writes Alison Jeeves. \"If yesterday was darts-playing toff day, today is time-wasting intellectuals day. Once again I am in august company. Am I the only one without leather patches on my jacket and a pipe?\" Sounds very much like it, Alison. 5.55pm Still raining, with some lightning thrown in for good measure. \"I'm just coming to the very end of my thesis,\" writes Liam Drew, \"and it seems that over what seemed like six months of very hard work I averaged about one page per day. What would Jack Kerouac think of that?\" I should think he'd write a long, incoherent poem about it, Liam. Or was that Allen Ginsberg? On reflection, I think it probably was. But, hey, they were mates, so it sort of counts. 5.50pm You have to say that West Indies just have the edge at the moment. One more wicket and they're into a worryingly long tail, although Ashley Giles has been scoring some runs over the past year. England will want first-innings parity at the very worst. Then again, if Brian Lara is unable to bat in the second innings, it might not matter. So many imponderables. So little time. \"I was right, Lawrence,\" reports Ashley Mills. \"Venice still smells.\" Sorry to hear that, Ash. 5.45pm I should add, of course, that if and when England do get to resume their innings, they will be trying to add to a score of 228 for 5 from 66 overs, with Andrew Flintoff on 16 and Chris Read on 9. Here's Matthew Cobb. \"Not sure I can help Amy Jackson with the writing-up, but back in August, Jen Walters of Stirling was pretending to write up her PhD on 'modernism and the occult' whereas in fact she was reading Guy Woodwards GU over-by-over commentary. I managed to wangle her a review in the TLS out of it, so it wasn't all wasted. Where are you, anyway? Stuck in Farringdon or in a conservatory somewhere out in what George Bush would call Chesh-shire?\" Farr-ring-don, Matthew. 5.40pm The bad news is that the rain has started to fall once more at Sabina Park, which means that my promise of cricket at 5.45 was sadly premature. In the meantime, some words of comfort for our PhD-writing friend, Amy Jackson, from Jack Lee. \"Would it help Amy Jackson to know that I a) wrote my PhD thesis in about three weeks following four years of not much work; b) failed - the first thing they told me when I walked into the viva was \"sorry it's not even good enough for an MSc\"; c) argued my examiners round so that after five hours they said \"definite PhD, just do a bit more work and some re-writes\"; d) couldn't be arsed with that so that today, six years later, I'm working in local government. No? Oh well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
