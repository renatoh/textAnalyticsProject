In addition, ripe apples roll across the lane from our neighbours' trees and I can catch them on the roll if I am quick enough. I knew that a hard March frost had hit the Quetsche plum at just the wrong time of its blossom period and a solitary mature plum hangs on a low branch. The nectarine, which blossomed earlier, did have a good crop, but the birds had the ripe fruit before we arrived. A compensatory success has been the Zeva raspberries which my wife planted. Sold as a late season fruiting variety, they often mature in November in the UK but in this warmer climate are at their best in September. Apart from catching up on the garden, the high tide has proved too tempting to waste and we took young Henri, the Jack Russell, on his first Euro adventure, across to Port Blanc for his first swimming lesson. Not really necessary, I held him in shallow water and he completed the 15 metres to the shore in a straight line and probably faster than my stately breaststroke. He shook himself and seemingly thought little more of this small adventure. Little egrets, the small white heron, were in the bay; they must have a significant coastal population here now. On the bay below us, which empties twice a day with the tide, curlews were picking over the mudflats yesterday morning and their wonderful, bubbling song carried on the warm air."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
