Reports in France have put his final price as high as \u00a358.8m, which is just below the British record \u00a359.7m paid by United for \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda. The purchase of Martial by Louis van Gaal, the manager, is some surprise given the size of the fee and his relative inexperience. United would have preferred to move for Martial next summer. However Van Gaal needed to strengthen his forward line and he was also conscious that Chelsea, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid were all interested in the player. Once Monaco were knocked out of the Champions League this cleared the way for the deal. While there is a recognition at the club that Martial may represent a gamble, Van Gaal believes he has the potential to be world class. The market has become super-inflated and so rather than spend \u00a325m on an average footballer, the thinking at Old Trafford is that the \u00a336m spend may be a far more productive investment should Martial develop as the manager hopes. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to join United,\u201d Martial said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to play in the Premier League and look forward to meeting my team-mates.\u201d The forward has yet to play for the senior France side though he has represented his nation\u2019s Under-21 team. He has only 11 career goals in French league football. An indicator of his relative anonymity was offered by his new team-mate and compatriot Morgan Schneiderlin. The midfielder revealed that Wayne Rooney, United\u2019s captain, had to ask about Martial after Sunday\u2019s 2-1 defeat at Swansea City. \u201cTo be honest on the plane, Wayne Rooney came to speak to me and asked me who Martial was, because the English press had started to speak,\u201d said Schneiderlin. \u201cI told him he\u2019s a great player with great potential, who has played some good matches with Monaco last season and the beginning of this. I told him he is technical and powerful. A little like Thierry Henry, even if it\u2019s the press who are making that comparison.\u201d Martial becomes Van Gaal\u2019s sixth major signing of the summer window. He joins Memphis Depay, Schneiderlin, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Matteo Darmian and Sergio Romero. \u201cAnthony is a talented young forward with great potential. I believe this is the club for him to continue his development,\u201d Van Gaal said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
