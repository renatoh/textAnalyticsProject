Manchester United had just been beaten 1-0 thanks to Josh King\u2019s volley and a third successive clean sheet, and the Cherries were 11 impressive games into what looked set to be another season of overachievement. \u201cWe felt we needed that win,\u201d said Eddie Howe. \u201cFor our own confidence and impetus into our season I think that was a really key game today.\u201d His team\u2019s defending in particular was a source of satisfaction. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with our last three defensive performances,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have to do it on a consistent basis. Three games isn\u2019t enough. We need to be looking after 20, 25 games of this season and showing a vast improvement to last year to really say that we\u2019ve turned a corner. So it\u2019s early steps, but the signs look good.\u201d They are now 21 games into the season, and the signs no longer look good. The 10 league matches played since have featured one clean sheet, one victory and eight defeats. With four points they have what is comfortably the division\u2019s worst record since that United match, and after losing 4-0 at West Ham on New Year\u2019s Day they dropped into the bottom three for the first time. On Sunday Bournemouth come up against a Watford team who have had an almost exactly opposing experience. Bottom of the league in early November with five points from 11 games, they have the division\u2019s seventh-best record since. The start of the Hornets\u2019 upturn does not quite coincide with that of the Cherries\u2019 collapse. Their improvement has accelerated markedly after Nigel Pearson\u2019s appointment as their third manager of the season in early December \u2013 more than 50% of their total points tally for the season has come from their last four games, the team sustaining over the festive period the impetus given to them by a home win over Manchester United. On the morning of 22 December the sides were separated by 10 points; if the Hornets win at the Vitality Stadium three weeks later they will be two clear. Bournemouth have had to cope with an epic injury list, with David Brooks yet to play this season, Charlie Daniels out since August, Nathan Ak\u00e9 hamstrung and King also likely to be out on Sunday \u2013 though Howe has suggested that some returns are imminent, perhaps as soon as the Watford game. But this is a superficial explanation for a deeper decline, most obviously illustrated by the dwindling contributions of Ryan Fraser and Callum Wilson. Last season the pair scored 21 goals and created 24, famously manufacturing 12 for each other. Neither player has scored since September \u2013 since when the only game either has missed was the victory over Chelsea \u2013 and the only goal all season that one has created and the other converted came in a 3-1 defeat at Leicester in August, Wilson the scorer. So is the threat the pair carry terrifying or trivial? And are Watford preparing to face the seventh-best team in the division, or the worst? \u201cWe\u2019re preparing to play a side that needs a result, that\u2019s playing at home,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cThey\u2019ll know that we\u2019ve got players that can cause them problems, in the same way that they\u2019ve got players that can cause us problems. \u201cInitiative will be important in a game like this, for both sides. I never underestimate or overestimate anybody. Really we have to try and find levels of performance for ourselves first. Because if we don\u2019t do that, it doesn\u2019t matter who we play against in the Premier League, we\u2019re going to have a tough day.\u201d Pearson contends that the idea of a team being in poor or good form is unhelpfully reductive when they are composed of a group of individuals whose morale will vary, and that anyway tactical discipline is of greater importance. \u201cWe\u2019re making an assumption that everybody\u2019s this or everybody\u2019s that, and when you play a team sport there\u2019s going to be a mixture,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some players who have doubted their ability, or have not had opportunities. In cricket they talk about batsmen playing themselves back into nick, and some of our players are going to have to play themselves back into form if that\u2019s how you want to put it. But you can have players occasionally having an off day as an individual \u2013 if they\u2019re still doing what the team requires in terms of the shape, in possession, out of possession, you can still function. Not to your maximum but you\u2019ve still got a chance of getting results, just because the framework\u2019s there.\u201d Troy Deeney has said that, since Pearson\u2019s arrival, \u201cfor the first time in eight years I have been treated like a proper man\u201d, while Ben Foster said: \u201cWe knew we\u2019d got the players, we just needed someone to basically stick a rocket up us and that\u2019s all it is.\u201d But Pearson has brought more than menace and motivation, replacing the 5-3-2 favoured by Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, under whom the attack was so slow it was basically static, with a framework that relies on resolute defending and in attack the ability of Deeney to bring others into play and on the pacy, tricky Gerard Deulofeu and Isma\u00efla Sarr causing havoc either in wide positions or coming inside. The 56-year-old former Leicester manager had the good fortune to arrive at the club just as Deeney was returning to full fitness following knee surgery and Sarr enjoying his first extended injury-free run, and both play key roles in the 4-2-1-3 formation he has settled on. A search for statistical signposts to the two teams\u2019 fluctuating fortunes provides further evidence that, in a league full of counterattacking sides, controlling possession often does not have positive consequences. During Bournemouth\u2019s downturn their possession has increased and their passing accuracy has gone up, as has both the number of passes attempted (from 385 per game in their first 11 matches to 449 subsequently) and successful (from 289 to 357). Yet they are scoring 0.6 goals per game, down from 1.3. In Watford\u2019s upturn their possession and passing accuracy has gone down, as has both the number of passes attempted (from 403 to 354) and successful (from 311 to 251), yet they are scoring 1.1 goals per game, up from 0.6. In the four games where they have had the greatest possession Watford have lost by an aggregate score of 9-1; Bournemouth have extracted two points from the six games where they have had the ball the most. But Bournemouth\u2019s decline may not prove terminal, and Watford\u2019s improvement may not be extended; further momentum swings are likely. \u201cWhen things go well I\u2019m always looking for the next hiccup,\u201d Pearson says. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we keep an element of realism about our own situation still. Long way to go, lots of hard work to do, all those sorts of clich\u00e9s \u2013 but it\u2019s absolutely true.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
