Given the current bout of unhappy introspection in and around St. James' Park the mere avoidance of defeat or a draw against such limited opponents is a small feat. Whether it will alter the prevailing mood, which is one of pessimism, remains to be seen but Glenn Roeder's players go to the Tees-Tyne derby at Middlesbrough on Sunday in better heart than if Antoine Sibierski had not plundered a winner 11 minutes from time. Fenerbahce arrived with a weakened reputation and set about justifying that opinion in a patchy, forgettable match. A goalless draw would not have gone down well with the 30,000 who paid to observe this trial of patience. Sibierski had been as anonymous as the next Newcastle man but the former Manchester City player, signed for nothing on deadline day, has scored twice in two 1-0 Uefa Cup wins, the first being in Estonia against Levadia Tallinn in the qualifying round. It remains to be seen if the Frenchman becomes cherished at St James' because of these interventions but there was relief at his involvement last night. Roeder must have shared that emotion. The manager made some bold decisions in his selection and if it had gone wrong he would have stood accused. Afterwards he said: \"For me that was the perfect result, to score and to keep that elusive clean sheet. It was very pleasing and I thought it was deserved. No matter what anyone else says, we have beaten a well above average European team in Fenerbahce tonight. \"I said it was vital to win our first home game and we've done that. If you can win both home games and get something out of the away ties then I think you can reach the knockout stages. I have to say I'm pleased we played Fenerbahce here rather than in Turkey.\" Newcastle now go to Palermo in a fortnight, the conquerors of West Ham having won at Eintracht Frankfurt last night. The teamsheet can have its own drama at Newcastle, as Ruud Gullit proved by omitting Alan Shearer against Sunderland. Last night did not compare on the Richter scale with Gullit's effort but the \"resting\" of Titus Bramble was less than straightforward punishment for mistakes made against Bolton. Craig Moore was alongside Bramble on Sunday and he too was stood down. In their stead came the homegrown pair of Steven Taylor, 20, and Peter Ramage, 22. Ramage's movement to his natural berth at centre-half meant a gap at left-back. With Celestine Babayaro still out, Damien Duff was asked to play there. Duff has done it for Chelsea and the Turks' lack of menace allowed the Irish winger largely to cruise through the 90 minutes. Behind the rejigged back four was Steve Harper; despite his visible stiffness and his inability to take goal-kicks, Roeder preferred his experience to Tim Krul's rawness. The 18-year-old Dutchman stayed on the bench. \"The very fact that we have kept a clean sheet showed the back four played very well and protected Steve Harper,\" Roeder said. \"I think a particular mention deserves to go to Damien Duff. He showed his class as a footballer tonight. Had Fenerbahce more about them, or had Mateja Kezman played in the first half the way he did in the second, Harper's vulnerability would have been more of an issue. But aside from a shot drilled straight at him by Alex midway through the second half the goalkeeper had to cope with only a few catches and clearances. Kezman left Taylor with ease on a couple of occasions when Stephen Appiah began to drive the visitors on at the start of the second half but it was a game of few real opportunities. It was 28 minutes before Charles N'Zogbia delivered the first noteworthy shot and, although Obafemi Martins was provided with a chance by James Milner nine minutes later, it was past the hour before Rustu Recber was forced into a significant save. Martins was denied then but departed soon afterwards, frustrated again. On came Shola Ameobi but it was Sibierski who was on hand when Rustu was unable to hold a Taylor effort from a Nolberto Solano corner and Sibierski bundled the ball in. For 11 minutes Newcastle had to hold on to that and did so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
