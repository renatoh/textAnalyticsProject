Tony Blair's latest, ambitious goal is to double the number of specialist schools to 1,500 by 2006, which would mean they would then account for nearly half (46%) of all maintained secondary schools. The latest figures show that 608 secondary schools have now been designated as specialist schools, compared with just 181 in May 1997 when Labour came to power. Schools awarded specialist status receive extra government funding, and are allowed to select up to 10% of their intake by aptitude, which has promoted comprehensive campaigners to level charges that they are operating \"selection by the back door\". Although they offer the mainstream curriculum, they also provide specialist teaching in a range of subjects. Until now the specialisms have been confined to sport, arts and media, technology and music. But yesterday, following extensive lobbying by teacher unions, the government announced the addition of three new categories - engineering, science and business and enterprise. All maintained secondary schools are eligible to apply, except in some areas where there already are large numbers of specialist schools. They must raise \u00a350,000 sponsorship from the private sector, prepare four-year development plans with measurable targets in teaching and learning in the specialist subject area, and make provision to involve other schools and the wider community. In return, successful applicants receive \u00a3100,000 capital grant and \u00a3123 per pupil per year (for the first 1,000 pupils), initially for four years. The Department for Education and Employment said yesterday that it expected the first engineering, science and business and enterprise colleges to start operating in September 2002. Specialist schools are popular and over-subscribed, not least because of mounting evidence that they out-perform their comprehensive rivals. Research by David Jesson of York University last year revealed that non-selective specialist schools had 52% of their pupils achieving five good GCSE passes at grades A to C, compared with 41% for all other state schools. Between 1994 and 1999, non-selective specialist schools improved their pass rate by 21% while other state schools went up by only 12%, although. some parents' organisations have expressed concerns about the pressure on youngsters to specialise too young. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, warned: \"This vision cannot be delivered if an overhaul of the comprehensive system leads to a widening gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. Expanding specialist schools to embrace engineering, science and business and enterprise can only be achieved if the government invests a great deal more money in recruiting the teachers crucial to the delivery of such a radical approach.\" Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers said: \"The prime minister ignores reality. He continues to set targets without considering whether they are achievable in individual schools against a background of severe teacher shortages.'' The education secretary, David Blunkett, is expected to announce details of a co-ordinated package of measures to \"recruit and retain\" teachers this weekend. On Monday he and Mr Blair will launch a green paper fleshing out further details of a 10-year education plan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
