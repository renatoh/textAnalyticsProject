All Italy knows a fix when they see one or even when they don't. \"Perhaps,\" I suggest, \"it is for the best. There are more important things in life.\" \"Yeah? Like what?\" says my friend in a voice that suggests, actually, there aren't. \"I mean,\" he continues. \"Greece are through and we are not. What is this? I mean. Have you been to Greece?\" He seems to regard Greece in much the same way Anne Robinson thinks of Wales. As it happens I had phoned him not to gloat over the football but to bemoan England's variable performances in the European Bridge Championships where Italy have established their customary lead and where they show (at time of writing) no sign of surrendering it, despite a strong challenge from, ah, Sweden. Another torrent of abuse follows. My friend does not regard bridge as the stuff of life. Diverting, yes. A pleasant way to pass an evening, perhaps. But better than sex? No. Which brings us back, as I knew it would, to football. Apparently it all began when Italy failed to sack their coach following their ignominious departure from the 2002 World Cup. I cast around for a way out of the conversation. Fortunately, I have a copy of last week's puzzle from La Repubblica, and as usual I find it has a clue for every occasion. \" Cosi e l'end migliore (5)\"* I quote, a Pollyanna to the core. But he appears to have slammed down the phone and I find myself listening to a long batch of dial tone. My girlfriend is not sympathetic. \"That's what you get for being hyperint,\" she says. \"Hyperint?\"* \"Exactly so,\" she agrees, \"(3,6,2,4)\" and smiles as she puts the finishing touch to Paul's puzzle from Tuesday. *Answers: HAPPY, TOO CLEVER BY HALF \ufffd Sandy Balfour 2004. \u00b7 Sandy Balfour is the author of Pretty Girl in Crimson Rose (8), now out in paperback info@sandybalfour.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
