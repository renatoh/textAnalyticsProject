It's called the national newspapers, and it's more or less free. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, before a sport became a brand, football had a bad press. Hooliganism, the reporting of it and the political reaction caused untold damage. In the age of the celebrity, forget hooligans. Players, and occasionally coaches, are the headline-makers. When 'Fergie Decks Becks' is on the front page for most of the week, it works in favour of newspapers (including this one) and the football brand. Apart from a very few serious cases, for football any publicity is good publicity - blindingly good, cheap publicity. Until last week. The players were overlooked as the press turned its attention back to those who watch football - or not - and the people who run it. Rip-off ticket prices and boring football, highlighted again in these pages last week, became the only subject worth talking about. At last, a sensible debate - and, for those who believe football needs a huge goal-kick up the backside, an enjoyable and worthwhile one. It must make interesting reading for the Glazers. The suits at the Premier League say it's too early to comment, that overall numbers might be down but percentages are up (stadiums), that percentages might be down but overall numbers are up (TV), and that English football has never had it so good. They'll be delighted about yesterday - a bit of drama and a few goals at last - but whatever they say, their own marketing department, the national press, has been shouting a hundred times louder: 'The Premiership is a rip-off! A bore! Don't pay! Don't watch!' There were even two references in the Daily Mail last week to a familiar phrase: the game that ate itself. That was the title of The Observer's campaign, launched last October, about rip-off prices, predictability, boring football... It took a while, but this season's all-time-low goal tally helped the message to get through. The biggest worry for the Premiership is that if fans think football is overpriced, TV companies might come to the same conclusion. They might be right, given that match-by-match viewing figures for Sky games this season are down again. Let's not get too down, though. If the brand is damaged, the game is still healthy. This is not a crisis, it's the consequence of years of putting the football consumer ahead of the football fan. Now is the time for the balance to move back towards those who care most about the game. Football is still fun, still a great sport, capable of making good news, of providing wonderful entertainment. It is generally 'a good thing' culturally - most notably in race relations. Its players, and some of its greediest clubs, do far more for charity than its loudest critics would ever know. We still like football at The Observer It's not all the Premiership's fault, either. They are not entirely to blame for so many games being on television; European legislation is the biggest problem. And when Lord Justice Taylor set his 'fair price' for a football ticket at \u00a36 in 1990, in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, he had in mind Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool. That \u00a36 then is about \u00a311 now, so even the Conference clubs - Woking, Accrington Stanley, Stevenage - are charging over the odds. The Football League have announced yet another initiative to bring in young supporters, but it still costs \u00a323 to watch Swindon, \u00a325 at Stoke - far more of a rip-off than price-conscious Manchester United. It's too expensive all the way through English football. As for predictability, it's too easy to blame Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United. The other clubs don't help themselves. If Blackburn, Fulham, Birmingham, Portsmouth, West Brom, Bolton, Charlton and the promoted clubs ganged together and lobbied for more support from others they might be able to muster the 14 votes they need to change the rules, to take money from the 'Big Four' and put it in their own pockets. Why don't they just get on with it? Much as the Premier League would hate a bout of prolonged internal fighting, it's time to get stuck in. In a few years there may be no such thing as a TV deal. Everyone will be watching on broadband, on their mobile phone. This might mean more money for the Premiership, but what if it means less? What if crowds continue to drop, even by a few percentage points? What if Manchester United rake in \u00a3100million from internet rights in Asia, and Bolton make \u00a3100 - will the money be shared? The flagship of English football has been listing for a while. Long may the debate continue. It's good to talk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
