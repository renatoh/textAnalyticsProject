Nobbs, who was best known as a comedy writer, was also a longstanding patron of the British Humanist Association, which, along with his agent, confirmed he had died. In a statement, the BHA said it was deeply saddened to hear of his death. \u201cDavid Nobbs was a very special talent and we were all honoured to have worked with him over his years as a patron of the BHA,\u201d said its chief executive, Andrew Copson. He added: \u201cDavid\u2019s writing was always funny, sharp, and acutely aware of what made people tick. David was a passionate individualist \u2013 he believed that meaning was something we were all charged with creating in our own lives \u2013 and he was a creator of memorable characters. \u201cAt the same time, he wrote beautiful stories which captured the essence of the human experience, tapping into the emotions and experiences we all share. His books and scripts got to the heart of what it is that makes us human.\u201d Nobbs wrote the Reginald Perrin novels about a man struggling with the mundanity and apparent insignificance of his own life. They were adapted into a television series starring Leonard Rossiter and a remake with Martin Clunes in the lead role. He also worked on That Was The Week That Was, hosted by David Frost, as well as writing 20 novels and contributing to the Frost Report and the Two Ronnies. He also provided material for comedians including Les Dawson, Ken Dodd, Tommy Cooper, Frankie Howerd and Dick Emery. Several public figures, including comedians, actors and writers, paid tribute to him. Ann Evans, Nobbs\u2019s agent for many years, said he was \u201cwonderful, one of the funniest men I have ever known\u201d. She added: \u201cWe were great admirers, we loved him. David was one of the leading comedy writers of his generation.\u201d Nobbs is survived by his wife, Susan, four stepchildren, eight step-grandchildren and two step-great-grandchildren. He explained in an interview with the Observer in 2010 how the death of his mother in 1995 had helped persuade him to join the BHA. \u201cThe most important thing that happened to me in the wake of my mother\u2019s death wasn\u2019t the strengthening of my feelings against religion. It was the strengthening of my feelings for disbelief,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t lose faith. I gained faith. Faith in people. I am proud to describe myself as a humanist.\u201d Nobbs\u2019s death will be commemorated with a humanist funeral."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
