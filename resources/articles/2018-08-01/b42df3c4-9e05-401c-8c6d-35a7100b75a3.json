The World Health Organization recommends cutting sodium intake to no more than 2g a day \u2013 the equivalent of 5g of salt \u2013 because of the link to increased blood pressure, which is in turn implicated in stroke. But no country has ever managed to get population salt or sodium intake that low, the authors of the study published in the Lancet medical journal point out. Their research, the Canadian academics say, shows it may be pointless to try in countries like the UK and the US. The study by Prof Andrew Mente from the Population Health Research Institute of Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster University and colleagues is large, involving more than 90,000 people in more than 300 communities in 18 countries. But it immediately reignited a simmering row with other scientists who are on a crusade to reduce our salt consumption to near zero. Mente and colleagues found that the harmful effects of sodium \u2013 raised blood pressure and stroke \u2013 only occurred in countries like China, where the liberal use of soy sauce leads to sodium levels over 5g a day, the equivalent of 12g of salt. And they found that very low levels of salt actually led to more heart attacks and deaths, suggesting moderate salt intake may be protective. \u201cOur study adds to growing evidence to suggest that, at moderate intake, sodium may have a beneficial role in cardiovascular health, but a potentially more harmful role when intake is very high or very low. This is the relationship we would expect for any essential nutrient and health. Our bodies need essential nutrients like sodium, but the question is how much,\u201d said Mente. Two years ago, the same team published a study with similar results, also in the Lancet, looking at individuals. It was lambasted by critics, who called it \u201cbad science\u201d and its findings were rejected by the American Heart Association. The latest observational study \u2013 not a randomised controlled trial which compares different groups of people \u2013 looks at communities rather than individuals. It immediately came in for heavy criticism. The chief complaint was that it did not accurately measure the amount of sodium in people\u2019s urine, which needs to be done over a 24 hour period. \u201cThe authors have not addressed any of the serious criticisms from the wider scientific community of their 2016 study,\u201d said Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London, and founder of the salt-reduction campaign Cash (Consensus Action on Salt and Health). \u201cThese criticisms include the use of ill participants in the study, leading to reverse causality (ie those suffering with heart disease don\u2019t eat much food, and consequently eat less salt, but it is the illness that leads to death rather than lower salt intake), and the use of spot urine measurements.\u201d Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King\u2019s College London, said campaigns to lower salt intake have been beneficial in some countries. \u201cIntakes of salt in the UK have fallen over the past 30 years from over 12g per day to 7 to 8g per day, and this has been accompanied by a fall in average blood pressure of the population. Japan used to have a very high prevalence of high blood pressure and high rates of stroke, and took action to cut salt intake in the 1970s and now has much lower rates,\u201d he said. But it is not easy to persuade people to forgo salt, say Franz Messerli and Louis Hofstetter, experts from Switzerland and New York in a commentary on the Lancet findings. They cite Sir George Pickering, regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, who wrote more than half a century ago: \u201cThe rigid low-sodium diet is insipid, unappetising, monotonous, unacceptable, and intolerable. To stay on it requires the asceticism of a religious zealot.\u201d The new study measured potassium as well as sodium levels in people\u2019s urine and found that higher potassium, which is found in fruit and vegetables, cut rates of stroke, heart disease and death. \u201cPerhaps salt-reduction evangelists and salt-addition libertarians could temporarily put aside their vitriol and support the hypothesis that diets rich in potassium confer substantially greater health benefits than aggressive sodium reduction,\u201d they write."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
