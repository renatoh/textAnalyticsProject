Cheer yourself up by indulging in plenty of red wine and a box of chocolates - a migraine responds well to both. 2. Learning to play the violin, or better still listening to your child incompetently dragging a bow across the strings, can be incredibly soothing for those tense, nervous headaches. 3. When using a computer, cut down on screen breaks and wear your glasses as little as possible. 4. Take on as much work as you can in the office, and always volunteer for the most stressful positions. As they say, a busy mind doesn't have time to get a headache. 5. Women often find Friday nights, particularly just after pub closing time, a dangerous time for migraines to strike. 6. When watching television always stare unblinkingly at the screen and have the volume on max. Watching videos on fast forward can also be extremely relaxing for throbbing temples. 7. Never wear a hat or sunglasses in the sun. 8. Washing down a lump of cheddar with a triple espresso just before bedtime will keep incipient migraines at bay. 9. Spend as much time as possible with your mother-in-law. 10. Falling out with your neighbours is never a headache. Fences, hedges, loud music, bonfires and midnight BBQs are all potent sources of harmony."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
