The education secretary, Charles Clarke, will today launch a long-awaited document on primary education - Excellence and Enjoyment - A Strategy for Primary Schools - in which the government will underline its commitment to the current system of targets and tests while recognising the need for improvement and change. Last week, Mr Clarke gave a strong hint that ministers were prepared to look at ways of making the key stage 1 tests for six and seven-year-olds less stressful. They face growing concerns among parents and teachers about the impact of the tests, and the threat of a boycott from members of the largest classroom teaching union - the National Union of Teachers - next year. The document follows extensive consultation with more than 2,000 primary school heads, who gave ministers and officials an honest assessment of the challenges they face in bringing about the improvement needed to meet national targets. David Bell, the head of Ofsted, has expressed his anxiety about targets and urged ministers to set them at more realistic levels. There are no national targets for achievement in the key stage 1 tests. But last year the government failed to meet two key national targets for test scores for 11-year-olds at key stage 2 - over which former education secretary David Blunkett once threatened to resign if they were not hit. Test scores in primary schools have levelled off after a sharp rise in the late 1990s. The campaign to scrap so-called Sats at age seven has gained momentum this year after a series of damaging motions at the teachers' Easter conferences. Barry Dawson, of the National Primary Heads Association - one of the groups in the new Primary Education Alliance - said: \"We're not against the principle of assessment, but there's evidence on Sats to suggest results have reached a plateau and are even beginning to fall.\" Peter Frost, the chief executive of the National Primary Trust, added: \"We are in a system now that's more similar to Victorian times than the needs of the 21st century. We need to start looking ahead and not back. Teachers have to be trusted.\" Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"I welcome today's conference held by the Primary Education Alliance. The conference will expose as ridiculous government claims that the campaign to rid schools of tests, national targets and performance tables is a non-starter. This evidence is stacking up against the government. It is absurd that England should continue with tests for seven-year-olds when in Wales their abolition has raised morale in schools and shown that the Welsh government trusts teachers. England is the only country which has such arrangements. Sooner or later the government will have to recognise the irresistible ground swell against the tests and return to schools assessment which supports rather than undermines learning.\" \u00b7 Only one-third of trainee teachers remain in teaching as a career, according to new research carried out by the Teacher Support Network, the information, support and counselling service for teachers and trainees. It found that 40% of those entering the profession leave within three years, and that high staff turnover can cost schools as much as \u00a340,000 a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
