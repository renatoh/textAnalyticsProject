Ben Lerner\u2019s first two novels, Leaving the Atocha Station and 10:04, were funny, cynical, metafictive delights, taking the raw material of Lerner\u2019s life \u2013 a Kansas boy making it big in the world of avant-garde poetry \u2013 and playing modish games with the knowing, waspish first-person narrative, constantly destabilising the reading experience. The books were absurdly smart, occasionally infuriating and often hilarious. The protagonist of Lerner\u2019s third novel, The Topeka School, is called Adam Gordon \u2013 the same name as the narrator of Leaving the Atocha Station. While 10:04 dispensed with fictionalised titles and called its narrator Ben, the three books can be considered a trilogy, in that the basic facts of the life being presented are clearly those of Lerner himself \u2013 growing up in Topeka, Kansas, moving to Brooklyn via an interlude in Spain, writing poetry and then novels, and becoming the father of two girls. If 10:04 was a diptych, asking the reader to hold in their mind two visions at once \u2013 Lerner\u2019s life and its fictionalised reflection \u2013 The Topeka School is a triptych. Moving into the third person, it adds a supplementary layer to the reader\u2019s understanding of the novel. While still asking us to step between Lerner\u2019s life and that of Adam Gordon, there is something deeper, more sincere and radical at play here. This is a state-of-the-nation novel, a book that seeks to determine how we reached the age of \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d, of Steve Bannon and toxic masculinity. The school of the title refers to \u201cthe Foundation\u201d, a community of progressive psychoanalysts living in Topeka. Adam\u2019s parents are members and each narrates two of the book\u2019s eight chapters. Lerner\u2019s real mother, Harriet, is a renowned psychologist who is attached to the Menninger Foundation. In the book, the parents, Jane and Jonathan, are revealed as well intentioned but desperately unhappy. One of the many powerful questions the book asks is how, when we know ourselves so well, do we still manage to be so monstrous to one another? Or in Jonathan\u2019s words: \u201cWe thought that if we had a language for our feelings we might transcend them. More often we fed them.\u201d That titular school has other meanings, though. First, there\u2019s Adam\u2019s training in public speaking (Lerner was a national debating champion at high school). This is a book about the way public discourse has been debased in recent years, how \u201cthe spread\u201d \u2013 the overpowering of reasoned debate by fast-talking shysters \u2013 has come to dominate politics. There\u2019s also the way that young American men are still schooled in the Marlboro Man culture of masculinity. Lerner makes a powerful link between the violence of young white men and the state of politics. \u201cAmerica,\u201d he says, \u201cis adolescence without end\u2026\u201d The act of teenage violence that foreshadows each of the book\u2019s chapters becomes a complex but convincing metaphor for the way America\u2019s heartlands have responded to being left behind by the onward march of progress and globalisation. I think Lerner would resist the idea of the Great American Novel \u2013 indeed the very word \u201cgreat\u201d has been indelibly tarnished by its association with Trump. During a protest against the caging of immigrant children at the end of the novel, Adam Gordon admits that he didn\u2019t know \u201cwhat the agents of the state were capable of, now that America was great again\u201d. But this is a great novel, one summoned by the desperate times in which it was written. Lerner has indeed grown up and he has created a work of extraordinary intelligence and subtlety, of lasting importance. The Topeka School is the sound of \u201ca public learning slowly how to speak again, in the middle of the spread\u201d. \u2022 The Topeka School by Ben Lerner is published by Granta (\u00a316.99).
