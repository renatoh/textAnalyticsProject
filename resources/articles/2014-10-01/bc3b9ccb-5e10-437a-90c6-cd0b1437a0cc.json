Joyce Taylor, a Liberian-born staffer at the independent migrant settlement organisation Multicultural Development Association (MDA), told Guardian Australia one compatriot who lives in Brisbane had lost 10 relatives to the disease. She said the man was one of \u201cquite a few\u201d in the tight-knit community who had lost family to the epidemic, which has taken almost 5,000 lives, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. \u201cSome of them are not talking about it and we\u2019re not pushing them either,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to give them their privacy and let them grieve in their way.\u201d The president of the Liberian Association of Queensland, Francis Davis, said the welfare of people visiting family in Liberia was also a \u201chuge concern\u201d. Davis said the association was aware of a number of Queensland residents in that situation but did not have definitive numbers. They would now be forced to undergo a 21-day quarantine period before being allowed to re-enter Australia under measures revealed by the immigration minister, Scott Morrison, on Monday. Morrison also suspended Australia\u2019s humanitarian visa program in Ebola-affected countries, a move attacked by the Greens as \u201cmiserly, selfish and cruel\u201d. On Sunday Queensland health officials said they had isolated a Guinea woman for Ebola testing in a Brisbane hospital. The woman, 18, had arrived this month under the refugee program with one of four families from west Africa, all of whom agreed beforehand to submit to home quarantine for 21 days. The teenager, who had a mild fever last week but tested negative to Ebola on Monday, was due to undergo a second test on Wednesday. The Greens immigration spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, compared the government\u2019s move to block west African refugee arrivals to \u201cshuttering up the windows while a house burns down\u201d. Morrison said the systems were in place to protect Australians. Taylor said the grief and stress of those whose families were caught up in the crisis was foremost in the minds of expatriate Liberians. It eclipsed any concerns they might have about delays to new refugee arrivals or whether Australia should send government health workers to west Africa, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite overwhelming at the moment for all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you actually talk to anyone at the moment in our community, they just don\u2019t want to deal with anything at the moment. \u201cPeople are just not in the right space for anything, they\u2019re just trying to support one another, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. \u201cRight now I\u2019m not sure people are really worried about their families coming [on humanitarian or family reunion visas]. They\u2019re more worried about how they\u2019re surviving back there, how they\u2019re coping with the current situation. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are worried about, \u2018Are they coming or not?\u2019 It\u2019s, \u2018Are they going to survive?\u2019 \u201d Queensland\u2019s chief health officer, Jeannette Young, said on Monday she was aware of 18,000 people who had been screened before leaving Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. \u201cSo there\u2019s a very thorough process which is happening at that end,\u201d Young said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to remember it takes a long time to get from west Africa to Brisbane, it\u2019s a lengthy flight so people can develop symptoms en route, which is why they\u2019re checked at this end as well.\u201d The west African communities of Brisbane are small but growing fast. The 2011 census found the city had 376 residents born in Sierra Leone, 112 from Guinea and 453 from Liberia. Davis said he believed there were now about 1,500 Liberian expatriates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
