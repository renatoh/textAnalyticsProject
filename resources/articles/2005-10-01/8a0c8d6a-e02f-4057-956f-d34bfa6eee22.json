He was the head of the society between 1992 and 1997 and was one of 15 former directors from whom Equitable was hoping to seek \u00a31.7bn for negligence. However, Equitable is gradually settling and, with Mr Ranson gone, is pursuing nine of the original 15 directors. Equitable has dropped the case in return for Mr Ranson paying his own costs. The Penrose report into the near-collapse of Equitable described him as \"manipulative\" and \"autocratic\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
