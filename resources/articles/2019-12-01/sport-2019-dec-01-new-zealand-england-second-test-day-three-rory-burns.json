Batting over five hours in Hamilton for 101 from 209 balls, the left-hander managed to adjust his approach following a chancy second evening that saw him dropped twice, with a more composed follow-up the next day, spreading 15 fours evenly around Seddon Park and looking more solid in defence. Burns admitted his eventual run out, two balls after celebrating his century, left a \u201cbittersweet\u201d feeling and would annoy his fitness coach at Surrey, Darren Veness. But there was still satisfaction at having found some previously elusive fluency at the crease and turning this into a score. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever settled in Test cricket but it\u2019s obviously nice when you get a surface that is on the flatter side to actually cash in on it,\u201d said Burns, whose maiden century came against Australia\u2019s hostile attack during the summer. \u201cThere\u2019s been some pitches so far in my career, that have been weighted towards the bowlers, so it\u2019s about taking your opportunities when you get them. It was nice to take that opportunity but I would have liked it to be bigger. \u201cI struggled a little bit with my tempo [on the second evening]. I basically just kept seeing it and wanted to climb into it and give it the kitchen sink. It was more of a mindset shift rather than a technical shift. I just tried to let the ball come slightly in all my play and kill it underneath my eyes and try to expand from there.\u201d As well as being possibly the first England batsman with a moustache to score a century since Jack Russell\u2019s 124 against India at Lord\u2019s in 1996 (he has been raising money for Movember but expects he will have to shave it off when he gets home) Burns combined with Root for a determined fourth-wicket stand of 177. On Root\u2019s return to runs, amid questions over his captaincy, Burns added: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously really nice to see the skipper get his runs. He\u2019s obviously a very good player and a lot of stuff has been said in recent times. \u201cNot scoring runs as a batsman might bring other things into the equation which aren\u2019t necessarily true. It\u2019s because when he bats like that, everyone\u2019s behind him and knows exactly what he can do. It\u2019s awesome to see him get them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
