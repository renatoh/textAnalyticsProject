Mr Joel Donovan, acting for Elena Cosentino - who worked for CNN for six years before being made redundant last March - accused the CNN executive producer, Rachel Brown, of rigging a company redundancy selection process so she could \"call the shots\". The industrial tribunal considering Ms Cosentino's claim heard that Ms Brown had devised a redundancy evaluation process that gave her assessment a weighting nearly two thirds greater than the totals of four other senior staff involved in the review. Ms Brown said she had allocated greater value to her opinion because the review was to do with new working practices she had \"instigated and help devise\", and therefore it was appropriate. Mr Donovan accused Ms Brown of using her marks in the redundancy exercise to get rid of Ms Cosentino, who had told her in a meeting three days before she marked papers, that she was unable to work nights due to medical reasons. \"It was already a foregone conclusion that Elena Cosentino had been earmarked for dismissal,\" he said. \"Your scores were deliberately weighted so you could call the shots.\" Ms Brown denied the allegations, saying that she \"totally rejected the idea that I had made my mind up\" prior to marking Ms Cosentino's redundancy papers. Ms Brown scored her with several zero marks despite earlier praising her work on the magazine show Design360 and knowing that she had been given a performance bonus earlier in the month. Ms Cosentino, who inquired about voluntary redundancy after CNN announced a restructuring process in February 2004, claims she was subsequently dismissed because she broke what Mr Donovan called a company \"taboo\" on claiming inability to work nights. Prior to joining Design360 in March 2002 as its inaugural producer, Ms Cosentino claims she worked \"four years\" of nightshifts in CNN London newsroom. She said she sent an email in March to CNN's human resources department, outlining medical problems associated with nightshift working. In July 2002 her fianc\u00bf was killed and she went on compassionate leave, returning to work in January 2003. She was told eight months later that she was being rotated off the show and back into news production which involved working nights. Ms Brown said she was only made aware of Ms Cosentino's medical problems at a meeting between the reporter and CNN's human resources representative on February 13 2004, which the tribunal heard she left abruptly soon after the medical issue was raised. Ms Brown, who was accused by Mr Donovan of being \"deliberately disingenuous\" on more than one occasion during her cross examination, faces further questions tomorrow. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
