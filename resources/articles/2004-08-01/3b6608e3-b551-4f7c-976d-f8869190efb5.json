For the rest of his life, Mydans had to fight suspicions that the picture was staged. He would point out that MacArthur was usually unco-operative with photographers and insist that the general only did the walk once. But even if MacArthur did not pose, in one respect he performed with a canny knowledge of the pictorial potential. United States forces returned to the islands in October 1944, having been driven out by the Japanese months after the Pearl Harbor attack in December 1941. But MacArthur did not land at the main island of Luzon until January 1945, and Mydans was the only photographer allowed to be present. In preparation for the great man's arrival, army engineers had put out pontoons to the shore so he would not get his feet wet - and it was along those that Mydans ran to the beach in order to take his picture. But then he saw MacArthur's landing craft turn away parallel to the shore. Mydans ran along the sand until the craft headed inwards, and as he had expected: \"I was standing in my dry shoes waiting.\" His photograph showed MacArthur sloshing towards the camera in his open-necked uniform and signature dark glasses, accompanied by staff officers and helmeted troops. Mydans later photographed MacArthur at the Japanese surrender ceremony aboard the USS Missouri. \"No one I have ever known in public life had a better understanding of the drama and power of a picture,\" Mydans later acknowledged. He had plenty of comparisons to make. In his long career he took portraits of President Harry Truman, Winston Churchill, authors Gertrude Stein, William Faulkner and Thomas Mann, poet Ezra Pound, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Indian premier Indira Gandhi, and actor Clark Gable. Mydans also covered the wars in Korea and Vietnam, the Soviet invasion of Finland in 1939, and the Japanese in China. He was often asked why he photographed war so much. \"War is not my delight,\" he would reply. \"War was the event of my years.\" He was born in Boston, the son of a musician and grandson of a bookbinder immigrant from Russia. After public school, he graduated from Boston University in 1930 with a degree in journalism, and had learned how to take and develop photographs. After becoming a reporter with the American Banker publication, he bought his first camera, a 35mm Contax, a competitor with the more famous Leica, but unusual in journalism. Most photographers used bulky plate cameras, but Mydans admired stylists such as Ben Shahn and Walker Evans, and they used small cameras. Soon Mydans was selling his pictures to newspapers. He spent 16 months photographing scenes of the depression in the south for a government department before joining Life magazine as its fifth photographer. He covered the usual range of Life stories, from Hollywood stars to western ranches and city life, but his first assignment to armed conflict came when he was sent to Finland. He soon proved to be a bold and unruffled war photographer, sending back images that still define how people saw combat. Together with the era's other photographers, he deployed his camera from the infantryman's perspective, but was more a hard news cameraman than a stylist. His insistence on getting close to the action resulted in his being taken prisoner in Manila by the Japanese in January 1942 with his wife Shelley, a Life reporter whom he had married in 1938. They spent nearly two years in captivity before release in a prisoner exchange. After a brief respite in New York, Life sent Mydans to Italy and France and then back to the Pacific. His imprisonment by the Japanese did not make him bitter, and for four years after the war's end he was Time-Life's bureau chief in Tokyo. Mydans happened to be in Fukui in 1948, when a major earthquake struck. He escaped uninjured but took memorable pictures among the 5,000 people who died. In 1963, he was the last to arrive at Life's New York office after President Kennedy's assassination, but his image of horrified American commuters reading the headlines on a train became famous. In 1996, the 60th anniversary issue of Life was dedicated to Mydans, who was still listed as a contributing photographer. His wife died in 2002, their son Seth is a New York Times foreign correspondent, and their daughter Misty is a lawyer in California. \u00b7 Carl Mydans, photographer, born May 20 1907; died August 16 2004"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
