The Solihull-born 19-year-old is at the centre of a fractious tussle over his international future, having represented Ireland at every level from under-15s to under-21s but attracted the attention of the Football Association following a fine season at Villa Park. Grealish has yet to appear for Ireland\u2019s senior team and declined the manager Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s offer of a place in his squad for Sunday\u2019s friendly against England in Dublin and the European Championship qualifier with Scotland the following Saturday. O\u2019Neill was informed the midfielder wanted to focus on his club football at the time of the squad announcement, with Villa involved in FA Cup final preparations and a Premier League relegation struggle. But Keane, who worked with Grealish during his spell as Villa\u2019s assistant manager, could not offer Ireland any assurances that is prepared to commit to their ranks. Ireland\u2019s assistant manager was circumspect throughout a press conference held ostensibly to preview the England friendly \u2013 including on the controversy of the FAI accepting a \u20ac5m payoff from Fifa \u2013 but was notably downbeat on the prospect of welcoming Grealish into the fold. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a timescale on it,\u201d said Keane on a decision from the Villa midfielder. \u201cWhat I found working with Jack in my short time at club level is that he\u2019s a really good kid. Obviously, I\u2019ve never been in that situation but whatever decision he makes will be the right one, whether we like it or not. \u201cI think if Jack came here with the senior squad, he\u2019d have loved it. There seems to be a blame game going on at the moment. Jack was unsure what he wanted to do and we\u2019ve got to respect the decision whether we like it or not.\u201d Asked whether Grealish was a lost cause to Ireland, Keane added: \u201cHe\u2019s obviously not made any official decision so we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Jack\u2019s a good kid. He was over at the FAI awards and he\u2019s faced with a difficult decision. I\u2019ve got my own thoughts on what he\u2019s going to do. Let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d Ireland host England in Dublin for the first time since English hooligans, some indulging in Nazi salutes, forced a 1995 friendly to be abandoned after 27 minutes. Keane believes there will be no repeat on Sunday and insists the shameful episode will have no influence on Ireland\u2019s approach to the game. He added: \u201cPlease God we will be talking only about football on Monday, I\u2019m pretty sure we will be. We are looking forward to a really good game. England are coming and I\u2019m pretty sure it will be sold out. It\u2019s an important game in the buildup to the game next Saturday. \u201cIn terms of looking back, I think the players are focused on what\u2019s coming up. The Irish lads want to turn England over of course. But what happened 20 years ago? The lads just want to win the game. If they get a good result maybe it will give them a better chance of being in the starting XI on Saturday. I\u2019m guessing that is what is in the players\u2019 mindset at the moment.\u201d Republic of Ireland (4-4-2, probable): Given; Coleman, O\u2019Shea, Wilson, Ward; Walters, Whelan, McCarthy, McGeady; Long, Murphy.
