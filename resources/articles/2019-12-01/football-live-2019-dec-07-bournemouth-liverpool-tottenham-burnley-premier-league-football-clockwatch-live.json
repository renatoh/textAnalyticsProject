I\u2019ll leave you in the Fairy Liquid hands of Scott Murray, who is watching the Manchester derby. Thanks for your company, goodnight. Tottenham Hotspur 5-0 Burnley The Man of the Day award goes to... Final scores You can check all today\u2019s results here. These were the final scores in our featured games. Premier League Bournemouth 0-3 Liverpool Tottenham 5-0 Burnley Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace Championship Fulham 1-2 Bristol City Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 Brentford League One Coventry 1-1 Ipswich Town League Two Exeter 3-2 Northampton Scottish Premiership Hibernian 3-0 Aberdeen Bundesliga Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 2-1 Bayern Liverpool P16 W15 D1 L0 F40 A16 You might not like them, but you\u2019d have to be a rare old plonker to deny their sheer brilliance. They would give any team in English football history a run for their money. \u2018Run\u2019 being the operative word. The buggers never stop. They are the perfect fusion of attitude and aptitude. Despite a ferocious late onslaught from the home side, Bristol City hold on to beat Fulham and move up to fourth in the table. Bournemouth 0-3 Liverpool Ben Fisher has already filed his report from the Vitality Stadium, where the best team in the world swaggered to victory. Jose\u2019s swashbucklers move up to fifth in the table. They are now only six points behind Chelsea. Fulham 1-2 Bristol City Fulham are denied an apparently stonewall penalty, and it\u2019s all kicking off at Craven Cottage as a result. \u201cNot all good news for Liverpool,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cWe have just ended our record run without a clean sheet.\u201d A tedious game ends with a bit of aggro. In a surprising development, Wilfried Zaha was heavily involved. Liverpool move 11 points clear with another comprehensive victory. Not even the apocalypse can stop them now. \u201cA clean sheet for Liverpool,\u201d says Ian Croasdale, \u201cwould be most welcome!\u201d You\u2019ve got Joe Gomez in your Fantasy team, I can tell. Aboubakar Kamara gives Fulham a bit of hope at Craven Cottage. A couple of goals in our featured games Northampton have pulled one back at Exeter - they trail 3-2 now - while Hibs have gone 3-0 up against Aberdeen. Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace The scoreline still flatters both sides, it says here. \u201cIF, IF it happens,\u201d says Peter Butterworth of Liverpool winning the title, \u201cwe do promise to be utterly unbearable.\u201d I\u2019m quite sad that I won\u2019t be around to experience such a momentous occasion. I had no idea this was on the cards when I booked a nuclear bunker in the Kerguelen Islands from March-June 2020. \u201cRob,\u201d says James Boyle. \u201cThe Fiver had a Stop Football campaign some years ago, If we Stop Football this weekend, do Liverpool win the league?\u201d No, I think Everton and Manchester United do. Bristol City have doubled their lead at Craven Cottage, and are on course to move level on points with third-placed Fulham. Poor old Sol His Southend were 2-0 up at Bristol Rovers. They now trail 3-2. He might have to play himself at this rate. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Matty Spillum. \u201cDoes Burnley\u2019s recent form strike a fearful blow to the proper football man set?\u201d Why are you asking me? I\u2019m wearing my Julian Nagelsmann underpants. Steven Fletcher has scored again! His second goal in five minutes gives Sheffield Wednesday the lead against play-off rivals BRENTFORD. The team news is in for the Manchester derby, and Scott Murray is about to dispense it. The reinvention of Jose Mourinho continues. Moussa Sissoko has put his freewheeling Spurs side 5-0 up against Burnley. Steven Fletcher\u2019s penalty brings Sheffield Wednesday level, deservedly so, against Brentford. \u201cWinning at a canter is my preference as it is much better for my blood pressure,\u201d says Mike MacKenzie. \u201cMy fear is that around May 1 the PL will determine that Liverpool failed to register some secondary player who made 10 late substitute appearances and we\u2019ll lose the 30 points from those matches.\u201d Bournemouth 0-3 Liverpool \u201cGiven the number of late winners and VAR controv, I wouldn\u2019t be calling this season a \u2018serene procession\u2019, for Liverpool\u201d says Marv. \u201cFun, though.\u201d You\u2019re not looking at the whole pie, Jenny. The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Bournemouth 0-3 Liverpool Tottenham 4-0 Burnley Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace Everton 3-1 Chelsea (FT) Championship Fulham 0-1 Bristol City Sheffield Wednesday 0-1 Brentford Huddersfield 0-2 Leeds (FT) League One Coventry 1-1 Ipswich Town League Two Exeter 3-1 Northampton Scottish Premiership Hibernian 2-0 Aberdeen Bundesliga Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 2-1 Bayern (FT) Two goals from Martin Boyle - yes, yes, I missed the first - have put Hibernian in control against Aberdeen. Two in two minutes for Exeter. Ramy Bensebaini\u2019s injury-time penalty has put Monchengladbach seven points clear of Bayern, who drop to sixth in the table. Exeter have come from behind to lead in-form Northampton. The leaders have stolen victory against the champions! \u201cHere\u2019s a truly terrifying thought about this year\u2019s Liverpool side,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI was saying to my friend David who was born in Liverpool and knows the team from Shankly\u2019s days, \u2018If a young Ian Rush arrives on the training ground, who does he replace?\u2019 Neither of us had an answer. If Ian freaking Rush can\u2019t start for your team, you\u2019ve got one hell of a team.\u201d Or you have a team that doesn\u2019t play with a classical No9. It\u2019s almost impossible to compare Roberto Firmino and Rush, because apart from their phenomenal defensive work they have very little in common. It\u2019s there! \u201cSTOP TALKING ABOUT US WINNING THE TITLE!!\u201d says JJ. \u201cEvery time people mention it I break out in cold sweats that the whole team is going to break out with a severe bout of norovirus, Hicks and Gillett are going to buy us in the new year and we re-sign Charlie Adam, Stewart Downing et al.\u201d In fairness, Andy Carroll has hit form of late, and you can never have too much squad depth. Bundesliga Jadon Sancho has scored twice for Borussia Dortmund, who are crushing Fortuna Dusseldorf 5-0. They will move up to third unless Bayern get a late winner in Monchengladbach. \u201cThat Son wonder goal immediately reminded me of George Weah\u2019s 1996 solo run vs Verona, which is here in full Channel 4 glory,\u201d says Jeremy Dresner. \u201cIn the sexy sprinting category for sure!\u201d Harry Kane gets his second of the game with another thumping strike. An insouciant flick from Mo Salah puts Liverpool 3-0 up, and 11 points clear. League Two The leaders Swindon are in complete control at Blundell Park; they lead Grimsby 3-0. Great solo goals We\u2019ve updated an old Joy of Six to include Son\u2019s masterpiece. \u201cYou can give it the big \u2018Liverpool are going to be champions\u2019 all you like, I\u2019m not buying it,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201c93 minutes into Newcastle away, if they\u2019re still top, I might start to believe. But even then, I think I\u2019ll probably worry that the whole season could be under VAR review: \u2018Decision Pending - No Title.\u2019\u201d Here\u2019s a question for Liverpool fans: will it feel weird, after waiting for so long, to win it at a canter? I always assumed that, when it happened, it would be an emotional rollercoaster (like 2013-14 would have been) rather than a serene procession. \u201cRob,\u201d says Simon Pennington. \u201cThey\u2019re already playing that Son goal on a loop at half time.\u201d And that\u2019s just at Watford. Ramy Bensebaini rams a header past Manuel Neuer to bring the Bundesliga leaders level! Here\u2019s Simon McMahon, generously doing my job ... so I don\u2019t have to! \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Simon. \u201cRunaway Scottish Championship leaders drawing 1-1 with lowly Alloa at a dreich Tannadice. Nicky Clark with the leveller on the stroke of half time. Expect Lawrence Shankland to finish the job from the bench in the second half. Elsewhere, Arbroath lead beleaguered Dundee 1-0, as do Inverness at home to Ayr. I think there\u2018s a game tomorrow between two Glasgow teams as well...\u201d \u201cWe aren\u2019t champions yet, it\u2019s early December - don\u2019t jinx it!\u201d says Sam Trenery. \u201cUnless that\u2019s the intention. Aside from that - I\u2019m really happy to see Keita on the scoresheet. There\u2019s a seemingly unending hope from our fans that he will come as good as he was meant to be when we signed him. Let\u2019s hope he can kick on now.\u201d The problem for him, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, is getting a regular game. It\u2019s hard to see that happening, certainly in the short-term, even though they are both cracking players. In fact, Oxlade-Chamberlain is probably more deserving of a regular place with his country than with his club. The half-time scores in our featured games Premier League Bournemouth 0-2 Liverpool Tottenham 3-0 Burnley Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace Everton 3-1 Chelsea (FT) Championship Fulham 0-1 Bristol City Sheffield Wednesday 0-1 Brentford Huddersfield 0-2 Leeds (FT) League One Coventry 0-1 Ipswich Town League Two Exeter 1-1 Northampton Scottish Premiership Hibernian 0-0 Aberdeen Bundesliga As things stand, RB Leipzig are top of the table. They lead Hoffenheim 2-0, while Bayern are 1-0 up at Monchengladbach. Everything Jurgen Klopp rotates turns to gold. Divock Origi and Xherdan Shaqiri scored against Everton in the week; now Naby Keita has probably sealed victory at Bournemouth with a cool finish from Mo Salah\u2019s beautiful backheel. There\u2019s no two ways about it: Liverpool are going to be champions. Sol Campbell\u2019s Southend lead 2-0 at Bristol Rovers. ICYMI , this is a cracking interview with Sol by our own Jonathan Liew. Tottenham 3-0 Burnley Jay Rodriguez heads a simple chance wide from Dwight McNeil\u2019s gorgeous cross. Ivan Perisic gives Bayern a deserved lead in the meeting of the Bundesliga leaders and champions, lashing a shot through Yann Sommer. A quickfire equaliser for Exeter. Randell Williams is the man spreading cheer around St James Park. These are the latest scores in our featured games. I\u2019ve even got the correct opponent for Sheffield Wednesday this time. Premier League Bournemouth 0-1 Liverpool Tottenham 3-0 Burnley Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace Everton 3-1 Chelsea (FT) Championship Fulham 0-1 Bristol City Sheffield Wednesday 0-1 Brentford Huddersfield 0-2 Leeds (FT) League One Coventry 0-1 Ipswich Town League Two Exeter 0-1 Northampton Scottish Premiership Hibernian 0-0 Aberdeen Bundesliga Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 0-0 Bayern (2.30pm) Moments after Nathan Ake limps off injured, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gives the leaders Liverpool the lead from close range. They are on course to go 11 (E-L-E-V-etc) points clear. Charlie Goode has given in-form Northampton the lead in League Two\u2019s big game. Keane... Will Keane! Son has made it 3-0 with an astonishing solo goal. He picked the ball up on the edge of the area. The Spurs area. Then he ran the length of the pitch, beating allcomers in the process, and slipped the ball past Nick Pope. The king of the solo goal, Matt Le Tissier has a big dumb grin on his face and has proclaimed it the Goal of the Season on Sky Sports. Bryan Mbeumo gives Brentford the lead, heading home from a wrongly awarded corner. Tottenham 2-0 Burnley \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that makes me worry more than Spurs going two down in the first ten minutes,\u201d says Ian Davis, \u201cit\u2019s Spurs going two up in the first ten minutes.\u201d Surely Spursiness and Jose Mourinho are mutually exclusive concepts? In the battle between third and fifth, Bristol City take a deserved lead through an emphatic header from Josh Brownhill. A lovely moment on Sky Soccer Saturday, where Paul Merson\u2019s voice crackles with childlike glee as he realises how easy it is to pronounce the name of Bournemouth winger Danjuma. Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace By all accounts, the 0-0 scoreline flatters both sides. Bournemouth 0-0 Liverpool It\u2019s all quiet on the southern front. Liverpool have dominated the match without creating any clear chances. Tottenham 2-0 Burnley Robbie Brady has hit the underside of the bar for Burnley, so perhaps that match isn\u2019t over. Talking of which... \u201cHave you forgotten the new law that specifies Spurs have to concede two goals in every game they play under Jose?\u201d writes Anthony Turi. \u201cDo you mean we can just write this game off as a score draw right now?\u201d The patented Guardian Score Guesser\u2122, having processed the first 20 minutes, suggests it will finish Spurs 74-2 Burnley. Tottenham 2-0 Burnley Now Dele Alli has missed a great chance for Spurs, who are thoroughly rampant. Tottenham 2-0 Burnley Moussa Sissoko has hit the post for Spurs, who are all over Burnley like a cheap clich\u00e9. The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Bournemouth 0-0 Liverpool Tottenham 2-0 Burnley Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace Everton 3-1 Chelsea (FT) Championship Fulham 0-0 Bristol City Sheffield Wednesday 0-0 Preston North End Huddersfield 0-2 Leeds (FT) League One Coventry 0-0 Ipswich Town League Two Exeter 0-0 Northampton Scottish Premiership Hibernian 0-0 Aberdeen Bundesliga Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 0-0 Bayern (2.30pm) \u201cI\u2019m not worrying about Virgil not getting a rest, as he rarely seems to exert himself,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cOften, the only real stressful part of his game is the energy he has to put into shouting at his fellow defenders.\u201d Lucas Moura scores from a yard to double Spurs\u2019 lead against Burnley. That game is already over. Live scores! You can follow all the goals as they go in around Europe by clicking this thing here. Bundesliga It\u2019s still Monchengladbach 0-0 Bayern, but Bayern have been very dominant and could easily be a couple of goals ahead. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cRight about now, Klopp is probably ordering his crew to set phasers to stun.\u201d I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ANY OF THIS STAR TREK STUFF MEANS. Harold Kane Esquire gives Spurs an early lead with a fierce hit from 25 yards. \u201cThere is a view,\u201d says John Tumbridge, \u201cthat the only reason Ferguson was still employed at Everton was because no one had the courage to tell him to sling his hook.\u201d There\u2019s a drone for that. Peep peep! It\u2019s 3pm, which means the 3pm kick-offs have kicked off! \u201cIf teams are Star Trek line-ups,\u201d begins Ian Copestake, \u201cthen Arsenal quite possibly provide the guys beamed down to the planet with Kirk that no one has seen before or will see again.\u201d That\u2019s extremely harsh on Andr\u00e9 Clarindo dos Santos (born 8 March 1983), more commonly known as Andr\u00e9 Santos, is a Brazilian footballer who most recently played for Figueirense. Bundesliga It\u2019s Borussia Monchengladbach 0-0 Bayern Munich after 20 minutes of the big game in Germany. Bayern have had most of the ball but neither side has had a shot on target, it says here. RB Leipzig, who are second, lead Hoffenheim 1-0. Premier League And here\u2019s Andy Hunter\u2019s report on Everton 3-1 Chelsea. La Liga Here\u2019s more on Real Madrid\u2019s comfortable with over Espanyol, which put them top of the table for at least the next few hours. \u201cGosh Rob, I\u2019d be scared to tell van Dijk he was out of the line-up and I wonder if Jurgen Klopp feels the same,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI\u2019m sure VVD has his light and whimsical side, but from all I\u2019ve seen \u2013 and this is my club, remember \u2013 if they were still making Star Trek movies and you needed an athlete to play a Klingon (as basketball\u2019s James Worthy did) could you think of anyone better? \u2018Prune juice. A warrior\u2019s drink.\u2019\u201d Championship Leeds have gone top of the table with a 2-0 win at Huddersfield. Both goals were crackers - Ezgjan\u2019s Alioski\u2019s volley and a header from Pablo Hernandez to complete a lovely counter-attack. Premier League Everton have beaten Chelsea 3-1 in the early kick-off at Goodison Park. The infectious fervour of Duncan Ferguson made for a classic Goodison occasion; his celebrations alone were worth the ticket price, and I suspect Everton fans will be talking about this day for years. Not because they beat Chelsea, but because Big Dunc\u2019s team beat Chelsea. Brilliant stuff. Liverpool\u2019s packed schedule has forced Jurgen Klopp to embrace rotation in the last couple of weeks. For today\u2019s game, Sadio Mane and Trent Alexander-Arnold are rested. It\u2019s notable, if unsurprising, that there is one player who is yet to be rotated. Virgil van Dijk has started Liverpool\u2019s last 66 Premier League games. (I\u2019m pretty sure that statistic is correct. If it\u2019s not, deal wiv it.)

Championship Leeds, who started the day in second, lead Huddersfield 1-0 thanks to a sizzling volley from Ezgjan Alioski. There are just over 20 minutes remaining in that game. La Liga Real Madrid have beaten Espanyol 2-0 to go top of the table. Raphael Varane and Karim Benzema troubled the scorers. The leaders Liverpool will go 11 points clear, at least for the next 23 hours, if they win at Bournemouth. They famously lost 4-3 at the Vitality Stadium three seasons ago, having been 3-1 up, though that was in the slightly shambolic days before VAR - Virgil, Alisson and Robertson. On their last two trips to Bournemouth, Liverpool have won emphatically, 4-0 each time. Hello and welcome to coverage of another bumper afternoon of association soccer. There are only three 3pm kick offs in the Premier League, but there are plenty of other sources of the old entertainment. One of the more intriguing fixtures is in Germany, where the leaders Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach host the champions Bayern Munich. You can see a full list of fixtures here. We\u2019re unable, in the absence of 482 hands, to focus on all of them. So these are our featured games this afternoon (all 3pm kick-offs unless stated, but you probably knew that anyway, and in truth we could have done without this parenthesis, especially as it\u2019s starting to go on a bit. For heaven\u2019s sake, it\u2019s taken up more than half of this paragraph!). Premier League Bournemouth v Liverpool Spurs v Burnley Watford v Crystal Palace Championship Fulham v Bristol City Sheffield Wednesday v Preston North End League One Coventry v Ipswich Town League Two Exeter v Northampton Scottish Premiership Hibernian v Aberdeen Bundesliga Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach v Bayern (2.30pm) We\u2019ll have team news and all that jazz imminently.
