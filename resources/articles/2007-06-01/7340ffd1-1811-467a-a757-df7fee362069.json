For two sets Henman often played exceptionally well, although by the third he was drained of fight and may have felt twinges in his suspect back once again, with his service speed dropping off sharply. Henman said: \"I played some good tennis. In those types of conditions it is so tough to play. You look at the style of the match and he is just dominating - that is what he can do. He is so powerful and you feel like you are just having to react so much but I feel I did great to get back in the set and had chances in the tie-break. \"Certainly I would have liked to have taken one of those and perhaps it could have been a different story after that.\" After trailing 4-1 in the first set and then staving off a further break point, Henman managed to level and was then 6-3 up in the tie-break with two serves. Suddenly it appeared the old confidence on grass was returning. But just when he most needed to be bold and attack he chose to stay back on his serve, allowing the Russian, ranked more than 50 places higher, to step in. He insists he remains mentally strong, however. \"At different times I did it well. In the tie-break I had a couple of opportunities. I wouldn't question my thought process, I just think my execution wasn't good enough. I would like to have made a first serve on one of those two points. I wasn't then able to dominate a rally but that's the nature of playing someone like Tursunov.\" Tursunov, who has now beaten Henman in five of their six meetings, is a hit-and-miss player and on grass, with its generally shorter rallies, this works in his favour. He hit some extraordinary winners and it took some fine serving by Henman in the second set to draw level. But the Briton could not sustain it and from midway through the final set appeared to be going through the motions, with the cold, blustery conditions also against him. Waiting for Tursunov in the next round is Guillermo Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez, who beat S\u00e9bastien Grosjean. The top seed, Richard Gasquet, completed a 6-4, 6-0 victory over Jan Vacek as he attempts to win his third consecutive Nottingham title. In the quarter-finals the Frenchman will face his compatriot Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment, who took three sets to defeat Teimuraz Gabashvili. Jamie Murray helped maintain British interest with his American partner Eric Butorac as they moved into the doubles semi-finals, beating Agust\u00edn Calleri and Nicolas Lapentti 6-3, 3-6 10-2. \"I think we played pretty well today,\" Murray said. \"We played one bad game in the second set but we played a good tie-break and we are through to the semi-finals. \"I don't see why we can't get right to the top. We compete with the best teams in the world; we don't necessarily beat them every time but we are a lot younger than everyone else so we are only going to keep learning and improving.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
