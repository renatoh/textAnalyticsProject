Typically in a general election, three-fifths of those who vote in a parliamentary constituency see their vote wasted, under the winner-takes-all electoral system. The situation in Belgium is quite different: who knows if turnout is 90% because of compulsion or because of fair voting? Those who, like me, have never had the \"privilege\" of being represented at Westminster by someone they voted for will resent Hoon's preference for compulsion under first-past-the-post over electoral reform. Sarah Ludford MEP Lib Dem, London The government has an immediate opportunity to extend enfranchisement. In 2004 the European court of human rights ruled that the UK government's blanket, automatic ban on voting by sentenced prisoners was in violation of protocol 1, article 3, of the European convention on human rights. The UK is one of only nine European countries automatically disenfranchising all sentenced prisoners, the others being Armenia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Luxembourg, Romania and Russia. The ban dates back to the Forfeiture Act of 1870 and has no place in a modern democracy. Geoff Dobson Prison Reform Trust There is just a possibility that it would be better to tackle the underlying problem that many people do not vote because they know their vote could not affect their local result or, consequently, the national result. Changing the voting system to the single transferable vote would give every vote the potential to affect the local and national results and give politicians an incentive to campaign to every elector in every area instead of just the swing voters in key marginals. Anthony Tuffin Chichester Well that'll be a day I never thought would happen - I've agreed with Geoff Hoon. His call for compulsory voting is absolutely right. I know Britons appear to have a compulsive loathing of compulsion, but the debate surrounding the policy would be a serious contribution to making people think about and actually use their vote. Alun Davies Bristol So Geoff Hoon wants compulsory voting. Geoff, why not start with compulsory attendance at all debates and subsequent divisions by all MPs?
