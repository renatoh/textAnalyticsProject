Every year on Bukovsky\u2019s birthday, David stood outside the British Medical Association with a placard of Bukovsky round his neck, urging the BMA to intercede on his behalf. At first Markham was alone, but gradually he was joined by others, including Tom Stoppard and Harold Pinter. Together they set up the British section of the Campaign Against Psychiatric Abuse. Markham also put on a transcribed account of Bukovsky\u2019s trial at the Young Vic with Paul Scofield. When Bukovsky was finally released as part of a prisoner exchange, David met him at the airport and sat beside him at his first press interview. From there he was driven straight to David\u2019s East Sussex house, Lear Cottage, where hordes of reporters were waiting. David\u2019s wife, the poet Olive Dehn, threw her arms around Bukovsky and ushered him into the house. To the disappointment of David, a proud anarchist, the two men\u2019s politics later diverged, and Bukovsky got involved with friends of Margaret Thatcher. The dissident never really appreciated how many years David had spent drawing attention to his plight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
