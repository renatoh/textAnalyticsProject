Eventually Crouch did scribble his name before boarding the team bus for the 45-minute journey back to Merseyside necessitated by the closure of Liverpool airport for runway repairs. Despite their healthy European progress - they top Group C and have virtually booked a place in the knockout phase of the Champions League - cynics claim Rafa Ben\u00edtez's personnel are in need of urgent running repairs and that a series of newly manifested cracks in his side are being camouflaged by Crouch's goals. Such fears will be confirmed, suspended or forgotten in the wake of Sunday's Premiership engagement at Manchester United, a fixture which is being regarded as a litmus test of Liverpool's latterly flagging title potential. Indeed, without Crouch's goals they might have been written off already. Wednesday night's header from a Craig Bellamy corner was his 11th of the season in 16 appearances for Liverpool and England, and the centre-forward trusts that such penalty-area proficiency may dissuade Ben\u00edtez from rotating him. Liverpool's manager changed his starting line-up in south-west France for the 96th successive game and has recently shown an apparent preference for pairing Bellamy with Dirk Kuyt in attack and leaving Crouch on the bench. \"I'm enjoying it in front of goal at the moment and hopefully I can keep that going. Given a run of games, I am sure I can keep doing it,\" insisted the England striker, perhaps rather pointedly. His header secured Liverpool's first away win of the season and, despite victory coming against a distinctly ordinary Bordeaux, he trusts it will be the first of many. \"We'd like to think this will be the start of a good run for us. And there's no reason why it can't be. We started quite slowly last year and then kicked on. We definitely feel we can play better and I'm sure we will do.\" It helped that individual Bordeaux players such as Lilian Laslandes, their former Sunderland centre-forward, were sufficiently laboured to make the recently error-prone Sami Hyypia and Jamie Carragher seem a formidable central-defensive pairing once more, but Crouch feels that simply winning away will have provided an invaluable psychological boost. \"This can only help us going into Sunday's game at Old Trafford,\" he stressed. \"Winning away is something we needed to do and in Europe, wherever you go, it's difficult. It was a night when the result was more important than the performance and you could tell that by the way we defended quite deep and tried to hit Bordeaux on the counter-attack. \"But we've now proved that we can get a result away from home. It's a massive boost because, when you look at the weekend's game, it doesn't get much tougher than Manchester United away.\" He hinted that Liverpool's confidence had dipped in the wake of some disappointing draws and defeats. \"We've all got self-belief,\" he explained. \"But some of our results have not been up to scratch, like the Blackburn game [drawn 1-1 at home], and we definitely wanted to make a mark in Bordeaux.\" Even so the principal impression Liverpool made on the French was of ultra-cautious visitors who defended far too deep for their long-term good and rarely looked like scoring from open play. \"We came to do a job,\" retorted Crouch. \"We defended well as a team and hit them on the break. We worked hard and the plan worked perfectly - but I'm sure we'll have another, different, game plan for Sunday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
