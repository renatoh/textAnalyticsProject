Once the Manchester United manager had opened the question of the Old Trafford succession he could not close it down again. With just one Premiership title in the past four seasons there has been no way to restore the hush of dumbstruck respect. Now the volume of the debate has been turned up by the 4-1 strafing of his team at Middlesbrough on Saturday. He was stolid on the bench but this was probably the restraint of a man scared to let loose a ravening anger before the cameras. He confined himself later to formulaic words about the reaction expected against Lille in Paris tomorrow evening. The time for such simple answers, however, is long gone. Should Ferguson's side win this Champions League group fixture the level of faith in United will barely ripple at all. He must know what is happening because he presides over a situation remarkably similar to the one he inherited when he got the job in 1986. Then, as now, some extremely good footballers were sprinkled through a squad that could not be trusted to win with any regularity. Then, as now, a dilettante air suited the side to the knockout tournaments. This, too, was an era when a United manager could at least stave off the sack with that sort of trophy, as Ron Atkinson proved for a while. Ferguson, always a student of football history, will be unable to stop himself from seeing the parallels between his present team and the FA Cup winners of 1985. For Wayne Rooney, Atkinson had Norman Whiteside, the 20-year-old scorer of a ravishing extra-time winner against Everton in the final. Roy Keane, bombarded by injury, can be treated as a counterpart to Bryan Robson, whose dislocated shoulder was a major topic on the sporting scene when Ferguson was appointed. The Scot had to rid the club of some dazzling yet rogue talents and merge those who could be trusted with worthwhile newcomers he had unearthed. Ferguson must reflect, too, how perilous an exercise it was as his career came close to tumbling into a ravine during the wild ride on hairpin bends to the 1990 FA Cup success. If the Glazers permit him to keep his post, he will have to do it all again, and this time, with Chelsea around, it is bound to be an even more taxing project. There might be no one at all in the football world who can pull off that mission, and Ferguson, at 63, cannot possess the galvanic energy of his youth any longer. Despite the protestations that he is as engaged as ever, it is hard to accept that he would always have delegated as much power to previous assistants as he has vested in Carlos Queiroz. Ferguson should have misgivings, too, because the current difficulties are arising after he has already spent much time and money on reshaping the squad. The manager has had his misfortunes but he cannot count on ever again having a dependably healthy Keane in the line-up and, outstanding as they are, Gary Neville and Gabriel Heinze will not be able to transform results from full-back when they return. The greatness of Ferguson had already been established at Aberdeen, with victory over Real Madrid in the 1983 Cup Winners' Cup final, but the revitalisation of United also tapped into a vein of good luck. No amount of diligence guarantees the emergence of the sort of brilliant generation that included David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs. The tale of the past few years has been composed of Ferguson's efforts to purchase players who could replace them or lighten their load. The results are patchy. Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n, Kleberson and Eric Djemba-Djemba have all been discarded and, at present, there is a crater where the midfield should be. Fielding Alan Smith there ought to be a pet project reserved for sleepy nights in the Carling Cup, but Ferguson desperately needs to see it work immediately in the big-time. There is scant proof that the Glazers, having raised some \u00a3790m for their takeover, can afford a sustained additional investment in fresh players. No manager can even count on the intangible benefits of goodwill since the world at large will watch United being crushed by an even more materialistic Chelsea and reckon they had it coming to them. The likelihood grows that the manager, amid a flurry of euphemism, will be removed next year. That will not by itself extract United from their plight. Jose Mourinho had it absolutely right when he said that the person under the most crippling pressure of all at Old Trafford would be the manager who had to follow Ferguson. Old Trafford candidates Sven-Goran Eriksson The Swede might be looking for a new job after the World Cup and, according to Ferguson, had all but agreed to take over from him when he initially planned to retire in 2002. But would Nancy want to leave London? Odds 5-1 Martin O'Neill From Grantham to Glasgow, his managerial record makes him the outstanding British candidate. The key is timing. When he left Celtic in May it was to look after his ill wife and, when linked with the Republic of Ireland manager's job recently, he made it clear that nothing had changed. 7-4 Ottmar Hitzfeld Has greedily accumulated 15 major trophies with Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Grasshoppers Zurich, including six Bundesliga titles and two Champions Leagues. Left Bayern at the end of the 2003-04 season for a break from football but is now looking for a return to management. 8-1 Carlos Queiroz Once the obvious candidate, Ferguson's increasingly prominent assistant has become a scapegoat for United's more insipid performances and further damaged his chances by accusing United fans of \"stupidity\" in a recent interview. 8-1 Paul Le Guen Not a household name but his record in France makes him worthy of consideration, having led Lyon to three successive titles before stepping down at the end of last season. 50-1 Odds supplied by Ladbrokes"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
