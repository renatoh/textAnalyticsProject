Tottenham have outwardly been expecting Kane to recommence full training in April but Mourinho\u2019s comments, which came as a surprise towards the end of a press conference otherwise dominated by Christian Eriksen\u2019s future, suggest the situation is not that straightforward. Kane was already certain to miss at least 12 more games between Tuesday\u2019s FA Cup third-round replay with Middlesbrough and early April, and any prospect of a significantly longer absence would be another blow in a troubled season. \u201cWe try the best we can,\u201d Mourinho said when asked if there was any update to the timeframe for Kane\u2019s absence. \u201cNews on Harry we don\u2019t have and, if you ask me every time we come here, the answer will be the same. We expect him to be out until mid-April, end of April, May, next season, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Kane underwent had surgery on Saturday and looked positive enough on photographs posted to social media later that day, but there will now be added concern about his condition for the start of the European Championship. England\u2019s first group stage game is against Croatia on 14 June and, if he is still on the sidelines come May, \u2013 far from the worst case scenario if Mourinho is to be believed \u2013 then Gareth Southgate may be faced with a tough decision about the extent of his captain\u2019s participation. It is far from the only personnel matter plaguing Mourinho, who is having to manage Eriksen\u2019s situation on a game-by-game basis at a time when \u2013 as he emphasised repeatedly \u2013 Tottenham\u2019s resources are already stretched. Eriksen, whose contract expires this summer, has been offered a four-year deal by Internazionale and could move on as soon as this month. The reception Eriksen was given by a section of the club\u2019s fans on being substituted against Liverpool on Saturday, when he was jeered off following a sub-par personal performance, provides an added complication should he stay. According to Mourinho, the uncertainty surrounding Eriksen is preventing the playmaker from playing at his maximum. \u201cIf you ask me if I think this is the best Christian Eriksen, I have to be honest and say no,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you ask me if I know the reasons, I am not an idiot, I have been in football for many years. I know clearly that a player in this situation is not a player that \u2013 even if he wants, I am not blaming or criticising the player \u2013 it is normal he doesn\u2019t perform at the highest level. \u201cI can also say he is helping us in matches that he is playing. Eriksen had a positive performance, positive contributions, if I remember the game against Olympiakos. The same against Norwich, a good performance. I think the same as probably you think and probably what our fans thought: he didn\u2019t have a very good performance in the game against Liverpool.\u201d Mourinho said he knows what Eriksen\u2019s future holds but that it is for the player to divulge that information. He made a pointed request that supporters back Eriksen in the meantime. \u201cI would say to the fans first of all that we always respect their reactions, always,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would also say that, if you love Tottenham, you go to a football match and support Tottenham. That\u2019s the only thing I can say. But again I repeat, we always respect their reaction.\u201d \u201cSome players become better with bad reactions from their own fans; they feel that as a factor of motivation. With some others, of course, it affects them. I have to go in the direction that I coach my team and I have to try to do the best for the team.\u201d Toby Alderweireld is the only fit first-team player who will be given tonight off. Mourinho said Spurs are \u201cat our limit\u201d in midfield and attacking positions, with Tanguy Ndombele and Moussa Sissoko both out too, and stressed his resources cannot be compared with those at the top end of the Premier League. \u201c[Hugo] Lloris was a long injury, then Harry, then Moussa, Ben Davies, everything is long,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot have a squad like some other teams. It\u2019s not us. I was watching Man City and I looked to the bench \u2013 Sterling, Bernardo Silva, G\u00fcndogan, Otamendi. You know? Liverpool, you see the team, you see the bench. And they have Matip, Lovren, Ke\u00efta, Fabinho injured. I\u2019m not jealous, I have an amazing job, but they are different jobs.\u201d The Benfica midfielder Gedson Fernandes is expected to add to Mourinho\u2019s options in the next 24 hours, signing an 18-month loan deal after undergoing a medical."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
