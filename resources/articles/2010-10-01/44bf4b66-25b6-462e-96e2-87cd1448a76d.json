The meeting presents Defra secretary of state, Caroline Spelman, with a global stage to share her government's ambition to \"protect wildlife and \u2026 restore biodiversity\". We applaud this intent and wish Ms Spelman every success in Japan. The challenge is enormous. The UN concluded in May what we all suspected \u2013 that, collectively, we have failed to halt biodiversity loss. This matters, not just because the fate of the millions of species with which we share this planet hangs in the balance, but also because we all depend on healthy ecosystems \u2013 from food and pharmaceutical ingredients to protection from natural hazards and some of the cheapest climate change solutions. But biodiversity is not only useful, it has an innate value which is important to protect for its own sake \u2013 it is beautiful and it inspires us. Political leaders have acknowledged that climate change is one of the greatest threats facing the planet and have begun, however inadequately, to plan a response. More than ever, and despite the current economic difficulties, the biodiversity crisis demands urgent attention and greater accountability. The need for governments, society and NGOs to work together is more vital than ever and we are willing to help. But we hope and expect our leaders to return from Japan with a clear roadmap to outline how this generation will be the one that can live in harmony with other animal and plant species. Anything less could prove disastrous for all life on earth.
