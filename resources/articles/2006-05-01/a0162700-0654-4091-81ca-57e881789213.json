There is a pot lurking in most of my handbags, a couple of pots in my office drawer and yet more in the pockets of most jackets. On leaving the house, the dance goes, \"Keys, phone, purse, lip balm\", and not always in that order. It isn't just something to apply when I'm bored or nervous (though those are valid reasons, too); there's a point to it. Even more so this season, when lips are often nude (so as not to compete with bright eye colours). Lip products these days are divided into three types: exfoliating (gets rid of flakiness), moisturising (plumps and softens) and protection from the elements. Do lips need all that attention? Well, yes - this season's sheer lipsticks are particularly unforgiving. \"Dryness and exposure to the environment can mean lips get neglected,\" says Clinique dermatologist David Orentreich. \"Lacking an effective lipid barrier, the lips' skin loses moisture easily. Habits such as licking and biting lips make dryness worse to the point of flaking and cracking, and can result in lipstick going on unevenly and wearing poorly.\" That's vanity taken care of, then, but what about sun damage? \"Lips are defenceless against sun damage,\" says Orentreich, so opt for a balm with an SPF and avoid petroleum-based products, which suck in moisture. Instead, try something with jojoba or vitamin E, such as Benefit's Lipscription. Looking after your lips also means lipstick is less likely to bleed. \"Wrinkles that develop as a result of collagen and elastin degradation often extend beyond the lip margins,\" says Orentreich. \"Lipstick migrates into these 'whistle lines', blurring the clean outline.\" \"And remember,,\" says Jean Ford of Benefit, \"two thin layers of lip balm are better than one thick one.\" My own tip? Well, if you smoke, stopping is the best thing you can do for your lip line."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
