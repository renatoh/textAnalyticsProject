The Hear Our Voices research showed that 52% of girls surveyed felt they were unlikely to be able to decide for themselves whether or not they got pregnant, while 40% said they were unlikely to be able to choose their husband. Plan spoke to more than 7,000 adolescent girls and boys in 11 countries across Asia, South America and Africa \u2013 the charity claims it is the largest study of its type to date. It found that despite improvements in girls\u2019 rights in recent years, insecurity, abuse and fear is widespread; 80% of girls in one area of Bangladesh and 77% in one area of Ecuador said they \u201cseldom\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d felt safe. More than a quarter didn\u2019t feel safe going to school, and more than a third couldn\u2019t use school toilets because of fear of assault. Around half of girls (51%) felt afraid to say what they thought in front of boys and men. The report also highlights how adolescent girls did not see themselves as having rights, some did not even see themselves as deserving of rights. Tanya Barron, chief executive of Plan UK, said the survey showed that charities needed to listen to young and adolescent women. \u201cWhether they are burdened with housework that prevents them attending school or at risk of teenage pregnancy and sexual assault, girls are being abused and limited every day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile things are getting better, girls are still constantly subjected to injustices that stunt their opportunities in life. We need to listen to girls and provide them with a safe space to be heard. \u201cMuch work needs to be done to accelerate change and tackle entrenched violations of girls\u2019 rights so that they feel empowered and fulfil their potential,\u201d said Barron."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
