The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said he was disappointed with Trump\u2019s decision but reiterated the Turnbull government\u2019s full commitment to the Paris deal. \u201cWe reiterate our full commitment to the Paris Accord,\u201d Frydenberg told the ABC. \u201cWe believe that the targets we agreed to, the 26% to 28% reduction in emissions by 2030 on 2005 levels are reasonable, are achievable. \u201cI do believe that it is still a very meaningful agreement. You have more than 190 countries that signed on, and in record time, 146 countries have ratified. So even without the US, around 70% of the world\u2019s emissions are covered by that agreement.\u201d But the decision increases pressure on Turnbull ahead of the chief scientist Alan Finkel\u2019s report which will be released at the council of Australian governments (Coag) meeting next Friday. Former Abbott government minister Eric Abetz has suggested a potential Australian withdrawal on the grounds climate policy could increase the cost of electricity and transport in Australia. \u201cI have long said that should countries like the United States, China or India withdraw their support or fail to live up to the non-binding targets, Australia should similarly pull back to allow for an increased focus on supporting families and jobs in Australia,\u201d Abetz said. \u201cWhile I will be interested in reading the final [climate] review when it\u2019s complete, because we must make our own policy decisions for our own reasons, the reasoning behind president Trump\u2019s decision may similarly apply in the Australian context.\u201d Abetz said at the very least the Finkel review should be delayed to consider the consequences of the US decision. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would be critical in the event that report was delayed so, as part of the review, there could be full consideration as to what the consequences might be for Australia,\u201d he told AAP on Friday. But Turnbull, speaking in Singapore ahead of bilateral meetings, ruled out delaying the Finkel review, as it was commissioned by Coag. He said while he was disappointed by Trump\u2019s decision, it was entirely expected. \u201cThe [Paris] commitments that we made, are in Australia\u2019s interest,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that Australians have affordable and reliable energy and that we meet our emission reduction targets. \u201cThere is a massive national and global interest in achieving that and maintaining energy, but you cannot be ideological about it. You have to be hard-headed. Turnbull said the government\u2019s decisions would be driven by economics and engineering. \u201cThe momentum towards a lower emissions energy sector is irresistible. It is driven in large part by technology,\u201d he said. Liberal MP and chair of the backbench environment committee, Craig Kelly, who was at the forefront of the campaign which forced Frydenberg to rule out any form of carbon trading, had \u201cchampagne on ice\u201d waiting for the US withdrawal. Early on Friday morning, he posted \u201cTHEY\u2019RE OUT\u201d on his Facebook page and welcomed the decision with a video of Whitney Houston singing the Star Spangled Banner. \u201cThere is a more efficient way to generate energy than using fossil fuels, it\u2019s just that mankind hasn\u2019t yet worked it out,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut if our history tells us anything, we are more likely to discover that new technology by combining free market capitalism with the wealth created by fossil fuels than we are through central planning and government imposed regulations that destroy wealth.\u201d With Turnbull in Singapore for bilateral annual leaders talks, Frydenberg said it was important to have the United States in the agreement as the second largest emitter. But he insisted the Paris Agreement remained meaningful. Asked about Trump\u2019s previous comments that climate change was a Chinese hoax, Frydenberg said there was broad global understanding about the significance of climate change. Frydenberg praised the US economy for having its lowest emissions intensity in more than two decades partly due to gas exploration. \u201cIt\u2019s got its lowest emissions intensity in more than 20 years and one of the reasons for that is the shale gas revolution which has seen gas overtake coal as a major energy source,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here in Australia, we\u2019re at the lowest emissions intensity on a GDP and per capita basis in 27 years. So Australia is transforming and we are supporting that transition in a way that ensures energy affordability and energy security.\u201d The government has already ruled out any form of carbon trading to appease more conservative MPs in the Coalition party room even though industry groups believe Finkel will recommend a version of emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector as one of the more preferable options. Finkel gave support to such a scheme in his preliminary report late last year. Frydenberg doubled down against any form of emissions intensity scheme following Trump\u2019s decision but predicted there would be big battles within the Coalition this week ahead of Trump\u2019s decision. \u201cIt would push out, faster than the system can cope, brown and black coal generators and right now, after we saw the blackout in South Australia, which was a disaster for the people and the businesses of that state, we can\u2019t afford to compromise energy security and energy affordability,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a dilemma that we face.\u201d Senior Labor frontbencher Penny Wong said it was a deep disappointment that the US withdrew from the agreement which represented the most significant global action to deal with climate change. Wong noted China had continued to express its support for the Paris Agreement overnight but said any agreement needs the United States. \u201cThe United States is a global leader; whatever it does, matters,\u201d Wong said. She called on the prime minister to be absolutely clear with the US administration to continue to press Donald Trump on climate change. Wong said she was disappointed to see members of the Coalition publicly advocating for the US withdraw. Kelly told Guardian Australia that while he celebrated the US decision, he did not believe Australia should withdraw from the agreement yet but should monitor its effects on the economy. He said for the US, the Paris Agreement gave China a huge advantage over the US. \u201cAfter those negotiations China would have walked away from table laughing at the US because they can increase their emissions to their heart\u2019s content,\u201d Kelly said. He said his concern was Australian would also be giving up its international competitive advantage of cheaper energy costs. \u201cLook at the Renewable Energy Target, we have simply spent a lot of money with not a lot of result,\u201d Kelly said. He said Australia needed affordable and reliable electricity supplies and \u201cat moment we are getting neither\u201d and the country was simply exporting jobs to China."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
