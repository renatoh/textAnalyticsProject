I was reminded of one of the young men from a British-based version of CeaseFire, the US public health programme, who had come here last October to train with us. Sitting with several of our members on a porch in Auburn Gresham, a disadvantaged Chicago neighbourhood, he enthusiastically threw his arms up and declared: \"This is Brixton! I am home!\" \"This is Brixton,\" carries a very different meaning today: burning cars, smouldering buildings and damaged store fronts. In 2007, in North Lawndale in the west of Chicago, a mainly African-American neighbourhood, police shot an 18-year-old man in the street. A crowd gathered, including the man's friends, family and me, along with five \"violence interrupters\". Violence interrupters are part of the CeaseFire model. They are trained conflict mediators drawn from the community they represent, often with a past that reflects the young people with whom they are working. At one time they ran the streets themselves \u2013 most have served time \u2013 but today stand as a positive, empowering presence in the community. They are effective because they can connect with those who call the shots on the block and have enough legitimacy on the street to be taken seriously. As the young man lay in the street, officers formed a human barricade to stop people getting to him. The community outrage took on a form of its own. It passed through the crowd with the intensity of an electrical fire. It was not enough that this young man had been shot, but to deny his family, his friends, his loved ones access as he drew his last breaths \u2013 it was too much to bear. That boy died alone. He drew his last breath without anyone to hold his hand, cradle his head or sit beside him. He drew his last breath alone on the asphalt to the sounds of screaming crowds, shouting cops and a community divided. In that instant, it was like all the injustice, all the pain, all the rage just erupted. Residents went tearing into the street squaring off against the police, mobs formed and the young men close to the victim went off to get their guns. It had come down to this moment. The kids saw it as the police declaring war. The police saw it as a justifiable homicide resulting in civil unrest. A violent clash seemed imminent. CeaseFire went into action right away. At the end of the day, what those young men needed most \u2013 to be heard \u2013 is what we provided. We listened. We listened for hours. And we talked. We talked for hours. Behaviour change works in this way, with consistent, persistent conversation. Hours of persuasion, convincing, arguing, debating, whatever it took to keep them from opening fire. The standoff lasted well into the evening. It took the six of us every ounce of energy and resource at our disposal. Eventually, we were able to channel that energy into a peaceful demonstration. Around midnight we marched on the police station and held a vigil. No more shots were fired that day. No one else was killed. Not police. Not youth. Not residents. This is why the behaviour change health approach works. It acts as an intermediary. It cuts through the emotion \u2013 the anger and defiance \u2013 by acknowledging it and directing it towards a more constructive expression. Tio Hardiman is director of CeaseFire Illinois.
