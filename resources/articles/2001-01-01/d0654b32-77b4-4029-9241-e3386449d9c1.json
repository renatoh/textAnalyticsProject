Well, it's all possible - provided you can skate. What began as a group of chums in search of a novel night out has grown into a major event in the French capital's week. Every Friday at 10pm, providing the weather is dry, up to 10,000 skaters gather at the Place d'Italie for the start of a gruelling but exhilarating 27km whizz round the city. Participants range from families to teenage toughs, to style-conscious young professionals flaunting the flashiest inline blades. There's a skating culture in Paris, stemming from the transport strikes of 1995 when citizens desperate to find alternative ways of getting around found that, for a modest outlay allied to a lot of nerve, they could still get from A to B. Some who loved the activity for its own sake began gathering for informal trips round the city. By 1997, numbers had swelled to several hundred, too large a presence for the pavements. In response, the police not only provided motorbikes and cars as escorts but created a special police blades unit: eight officers trained by a former Olympic speed-skater to accompany the crowd on its journey. Since then, the event's popularity has soared. The record to date is 20,000 participants, and it regularly draws a field of between 5,000 and 10,000 that includes an increasing number of British bladers . The only problem for those who fancy this novel way of seeing the city is that Pari Roller, as it is known, is not for the novice. So first, you have to learn to skate. I joined a group trying out the new Skate Reebok programme, which combines basic techniques with a fitness system. The idea is that you master the essentials and then learn how to use them as a regular exercise regime to increase strength, muscle tone and cardiovascular endurance. Reebok trainer and personal fitness instructor Steve Barratt took us to the Bois de Boulogne for a beginner's lesson. This starts with, one, the kit: knee pads and wrist guards could prevent serious injury because, two, you will fall over and, three, you need to know how to do this - forward on to your knees, not back on to your head - in order to avoid concussion. Kitted up and with a few practice falls behind us, we moved on to basic posture. As we grew in wobbly confidence, we learned how to glide, turn and, crucially in the city, how to stop. Steve reckons that it's possible to get all but the most unfit skating within a couple of hours, and it was extraordinary how even those of us who'd never put on a pair of inline blades before were, by the end of the session, finding our feet. Sadly, tootling along the smooth paths of a park in the afternoon sunshine is a far cry from holding one's own in the Friday night fever of Pari Roller. Only two of our group, already accomplished skaters, had the skills necessary to handle the kerbs and cobbles and the speed of the route. Traffic is halted to let the skaters pass by, but you have to keep up: the 27km are covered in three hours. The rest of us had to watch as our two accomplished companions and Steve mingled with the crowd in a near-carnival atmosphere whose adrenalin charge mounted as 10pm approached. Then, with police sirens wailing, blue lights flashing, motorbikes revving, stewards' whistles blowing and a great roar of encouragement, they were off - a vast wheel-based human tide rolling into the night. At 1am, we met again with the three bladers, who were exhausted and exhilarated, and thrilled by the experience of seeing famous landmarks such as the Eiffel tower, the Louvre and Notre Dame go rolling by. They were full of the protocols of the event: how the skaters in front raise their arms to signal a hazard - a cable across the street, for instance, or a fallen comrade - so that those behind can avoid it; how if you're flagging, the stewards will grab your arm and gee you up. The rest of us felt accursed we were not there. Still, with a bit of practice we may master a skill that will get us through the next fuel crisis.
