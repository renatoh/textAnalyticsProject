As I speak, Mr Bush is down the road at the Banqueting Hall delivering a speech under a ceiling painted by Rubens for Charles I in a building designed by Inigo Jones. Little did Charles know he was going to get his head chopped off at a window in that very building on January 30 1649. It must bear down on Mr Bush - if Tony Blair's told him - as a reminder of just how mortal leaders are when they get things wrong. \"Mr Blair must have had similar thoughts today facing Michael Howard for the second time at prime minister's questions, on an afternoon when MPs are about to vote on foundation hospitals and their exclusion from the government's health and community care bill. MPs are deciding whether they will agree with the Lords or the Commons. \"The striking thing about question time for me - not having seen Michael Howard's performance last week - was that he was very eloquent and smart, he's a bright high-value-added lawyer. And also that Mr Blair, slightly disconcerted though he was, was fighting back. It's a proper contest, this one, between two people who ought to be in the ring together. Time and time again Mr Blair went after Mr Howard's record as a minister during the late 80s and early 90s, which is obviously what Labour plans to do. \"John Reid and his allies are going round Westminster with great long faces saying that they expect to be defeated in the foundation hospitals vote. In my long experience of these things that tends to mean they think they'll just scrape home and are trying to get negative reports in the media, which makes Labour MPs ask themselves whether they really want the Lords to win out. Do we really want to give Michael Howard a triumph two or three weeks into his leadership? And are we really saying that if ministers want to devolve power away from the centre away from Whitehall down to local management and democratise accountability in major NHS hospitals - which is what ministers certainly say they are trying to do - then do we really want to vote down this important project? That's really the question. And the issue is that part one, clause one of the bill which is all about setting up foundation hospitals was voted down by a cross-party alliance of peers a few days ago. Sixty-odd Labour MPs voted against it last time it was before the Commons, cutting the government's majority to 35. \"This time, anti-foundation trust Labour MPs tell me there are a dozen more Labour MPs who will vote against the government. But pro-government sources say others have drifted back in favour - they have been persuaded by Mr Reid's intellectual arguments defending the bill as well as his political ones about not handing a free kick to the Tories and the Lords. \"One thing to watch out for - among anoraks who follow these things as closely as I do - is the whereabouts of the Ulster Unionists and the Democratic Unionist party. Are they in Westminster, and which side will they vote on? They voted with the government last time round in favour of foundation hospital status - they have quite an efficient NHS in Northern Ireland. But will they stay in Belfast campaigning for the assembly election due next week? What they do may determine the outcome if it's a close vote. \"One thing's for sure. Richard Caborn, the sports minister who thought he was going to be in Australia for the Rugby World Cup final, will be fuming, quietly, as he enters the government's division lobby - 11,000 miles from where he wanted to be.\" BREAKING NEWS The government won this afternoon's crucial vote on foundation hospitals by a much-reduced majority of 17. Full story David Blunkett has called for the procedure for employment checks at Buckingham Palace to be \"urgently\" reviewed, after an undercover reporter breached security to become a footman at the Queen's London residence. Full story Alastair Campbell has launched a vicious attack on the media, saying they have become a \"barrier\" between the government and voters and are more concerned with speed than with accuracy.

CHRISTMAS MOCKING Roy Hattersley's revelations concerning his pair of Labour gnomes have prompted a trickle of similar confessions from readers. \"Well, I've got a Michael Foot candle,\" admits a reader in Staffordshire. \"As bought from a charity shop in Hoylake.\" Do you possess an embarrassing item of political memorabilia? Did the local Oxfam shop refuse it? Have you tried and failed to dispose of it on eBay? Do you \"hide\" it in the bathroom, only to be mocked by drunken guests at your dinner parties? If so, email the Backbencher, who will endeavour to take it off your hands. Now, how much are we bid for this glorious waxwork? Send in your offers to backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION In the meantime, thanks for the dozens of entries to last week's competition, many showing signs of wit. \"Irredentism (n): An anti-teeth ideology. Deeply entrenched in British political life - displayed through refusal to bow to the 'pearly whites' politics of appearance by letting one's teeth go to pot, but also manifested in Thatcherite health policies,\" wrote Chloe. Emer Delaney might have been in with a chance (\"Give the dictionary to the poor politics student!! The LSE has stolen all our money\"), but the Backbencher discovered he had taken his definition verbatim from Google. Brian from Nottinghamshire put it rather well: \"This is the condition wherein political stirrers become bellicose about their co-ethnics living in the territory of another government, eg Sudeten Germans in Czechoslovakia, 1938.\" But the prize goes to Rachel Fentem, with this definition: \"Irredentism describes nationalist movements to reincorporate regions under foreign control. The term comes from 'Italia irredenta', those territories with majority Italian populations but retained by Austria post-1866. The term could perhaps be illustrated by the attitude of the Blair camp towards the Treasury, or the Tories towards most of the country.\" THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION This week, the Backbencher has a copy of Matthew Parris's autobiography, Chance Witness, to give away, courtesy of Penguin. For a chance of winning it, remind her how much money Richard Desmond (who lunched with Michael Howard yesterday and assured him that the Telegraph would remain Tory if he bought it) donated to the Labour party in 2001. Email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. ER ... THAT OTHER COMPETITION A couple of weeks ago, we asked readers to name the first British PM to have benefited from a state education. The prize was duly awarded to a reader who suggested Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who attended Glasgow High School. An annoyed reader who had nominated David Lloyd George. \"Glasgow High is a private school,\" he wrote. \"My entry still stands.\" With the prize not yet dispatched, the Backbencher is forced to make a public climb-down. She was misinformed. Apologies to the \"winner\" announced last week, who stands an excellent chance of winning future competitions. Peter - your book will be on its way just as soon as we receive it from Routledge. PORKER OR STICK INSECT? In past weeks, the Backbencher has made gentle fun of Stephen Pollard's very successful adoption of the Atkins diet. She has referred to the shrinking carnivore as \"the T-Rex of political columnists\" and, last week, invited readers to send him gifts of stollen and mince pies to sustain him during the festive season. Mr Pollard is mystified by this attention. \"Now this isn't, of course, angry in tone, but it is - sort of - sneering. And weird,\" he writes. \"I cannot begin to fathom why readers of the Guardian would be in the least bit interested in the dietary habits of a man of whom they have never heard. But the diarist obviously is.\" \"I have no idea if the Guardian's diarist is a porker or a stick insect. And I also have no idea why he (I assume it's a he, since I omitted to point out above that [...] neither I nor any of my Atkins dieting friends have ever had a sneering response from a woman, of any shape) should be so fascinated by my diet. Any ideas?\" None whatsoever, on reflection. We shall speak no more of Stephen's diet, and readers who wish to continue receiving regular reports of his progress are directed to his weblog. As for the questions of gender and size - well, as Stephen rightly hints, they are scarcely a matter for a politically minded column of this kind. LIBS AND LOVES Meanwhile, a heart is beating faster at the Lib Dem News - where articles about the East Midlands regional conference jostle for space with advertisements for the Lloyd George Weekend School in Llanwrtyd Wells. The editor, dispatched to plenary week in Brussels, has developed a crush on an Italian MEP. \"I had difficulty concentrating on his replies to my questions,\" she revealed. \"He was uncomfortably gorgeous.\" Sadly, Francesco Rutelli is already married to a well-known Italian journalist, Barbara Palombelli, but readers can admire his campaign posters here. CHARIOT OF FIRE To Sussex - and news of an appalling infringement of the right to free speech. It concerns Nigel Farage, the stunt-prone UK Independence party MEP, and his attempt to set fire to a caravan. \"Mr Farage,\" explains UKIP's press officer, \"a member of the Society of Ted Heath Burners, was intending to burn a caravan containing effigies of Sir Edward Heath, John Major and Tony Blair. His intention was to demonstrate the absurdity of Sussex Police's actions earlier this week when they arrested a group of villagers for burning an effigy of a gypsy caravan on the grounds that it 'incited racial hatred'.\" It isn't a parallel the Backbencher would like to have to defend in court. Needless to say, however, the police fell for Nigel's stunt and duly turned up to reprimand him. Threatened with arrest on the grounds of \"inciting racial hatred\", he was able to issue a press release complaining that officers were \"suppressing free speech\" and wasting time on \"politically correct crime\". The message for Sussex police - and, indeed, the fire brigade - is clear. If you get an agitated call from a man called Nigel who claims to have set a caravan on fire, just ignore him. He's only trying to frame the local constabulary, and sending out a panda car will just encourage him.
