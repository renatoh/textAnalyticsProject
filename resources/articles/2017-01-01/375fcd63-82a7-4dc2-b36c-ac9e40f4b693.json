The newly introduced bill \u2013 which seeks to build on an existing GOP-backed law that banned a Mexican American studies class \u2013 marks the latest attack in academia on activism and research centered on marginalized groups. Some opponents said the proposal is part of a national trend, tied to the election of Donald Trump, of lawmakers working to suppress progressive organizations and protests. The bill, from state representative Bob Thorpe, would prohibit \u201ccourses, classes, events and activities\u201d in public schools that promote \u201csocial justice toward a race, gender, religion, political affiliation, social class or other class of people\u201d. Courses and events that are \u201cdesigned primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group\u201d or advocate \u201csolidarity\u201d based on ethnicity, race, religion or gender would also be banned. \u201cThis really challenges a bedrock foundation of what it means to be involved in the academy,\u201d said Rashad Shabazz, head faculty in the program of justice and social inquiry at Arizona State University. \u201cIt really puts a target on people of color and various academic fields that have emerged out of struggle.\u201d The proposal comes at a time in which the polarizing presidential election has fueled intense debates surrounding first amendment rights and academic freedom in American universities. In recent months, conservative groups on campuses across the US have launched coordinated attacks against professors and courses that promote liberal ideologies or challenge traditional views on race and gender. In Wisconsin, a Republican senator recently attacked an undergraduate program focused on \u201cunpacking masculinity\u201d, which the lawmaker called a \u201cwar on men\u201d. Lawmakers there have also threatened to cut funding over a race relations course called The Problem of Whiteness and a reading assignment about gay men\u2019s sexual preferences that a legislator said was \u201coffensive\u201d. The University of California, Berkeley, last year cancelled a course examining Palestine \u201cthrough the lens of settler colonialism\u201d following an outcry from pro-Israel groups, but later reinstated the class. Meanwhile, some universities have faced scrutiny from progressive activists for allowing white nationalists and leaders of the \u201calt-right\u201d \u2013 a far-right movement in the US \u2013 who promote hate speech to speak on campus. Thorpe\u2019s bill is particularly far-reaching in its targeting of social justice organizing and ethnic studies, said Mart\u00edn Quezada, a Democratic state senator, and has prompted an outcry on Arizona campuses. \u201cOur students are terrified that their freedom of speech, their freedom of thought and their ability to learn about issues and think at a higher level is in jeopardy now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scariest part of this bill is that the impacts are so broad.\u201d Thorpe declined the Guardian\u2019s interview request, but told Tucson.com he wanted to target an ASU course called Whiteness and Race Theory, as well as a university event called a \u201cprivilege walk\u201d, where students are supposed to reflect on their race and privilege. The legislation, which says a violation would allow the state to cut 10% of a district\u2019s funding, would not prohibit courses that cover the \u201caccurate history of any ethnic group\u201d and allows for teachings on the holocaust or \u201cany other instance of genocide\u201d. But Katt McKinney, organizer with Black Lives Matter in Arizona, said it seemed obvious that the language of the bill was targeting groups like hers that fight for racial justice. \u201cThey want to shut it down,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a direct attack on the constitutional rights of citizens.\u201d The state\u2019s 2010 law banning a specific Mexican American studies program in Tucson has been the subject of lengthy litigation and targeted a course that was proven to be effective for students, according to Quezada. The Arizona school boards association said it opposes Thorpe\u2019s bill because the state should not have control over school content. \u201cIt should be up to each district what kind of curriculum should be approved,\u201d said spokeswoman Heidi Vega. Though Arizona has a history of these kinds of proposals, Shabazz said he felt that Trump\u2019s victory and the GOP wins in November have emboldened Republican lawmakers to aggressively target the work of minorities. \u201cBy attempting to legislate against certain types of activities that focus on people of color, women or social justice issues,\u201d he added, \u201cit really undermines the ability of the university to function as a space of intellectual engagement and debate.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
