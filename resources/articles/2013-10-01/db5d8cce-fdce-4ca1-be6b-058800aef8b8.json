No, just this film", "bodyText": "The British have upset film-maker Oliver Hirschbiegel, who's expressed his \"devastation\" over the mauling of his biopic of Princess Diana, starring Naomi Watts. It has not done too well commercially, either. In Diana's opening week, it finished fifth in the box offices; a week later, its audiences halved. Hirschbiegel said that the critical reaction was similar to what newspapers said about the real Diana when she was alive: \"Really vile things. So I guess I succeeded.\" Hirschbiegel also said: \"In all other places where it's opened \u2013 in Poland, the Czech Republic, Turkey and Slovakia \u2013 it's been very strong. I think, for the British, Diana is still a trauma they haven't come to terms with.\" Well deflected, Mr Hirschbiegel, but that doesn't make it true. Downfall showed that Hirschbiegel is a gifted director. However, he is confused, to put it politely, over the British reaction to Diana the film and, indeed, Diana the memory. Likening the reception of the film to the press hounding of the person is bizarre enough. The film was slated because it stank, resembling a TV movie dreamed up by the late Dame Barbara Cartland in her cups. Watts mooned about, through landmines and on to yachts, with what appeared to be silly putty stuck on to her nose, murmuring dialogue that belonged in some Sloane-themed Mills &amp; Boon novel. As Stephen Frears's The Queen managed to portray British royalty and Diana's death honestly, there is simply no excuse for how oversentimentalised, facile and tourist-friendly Diana was \u2013 akin to being smothered with a damp souvenir tea towel. For Hirschbiegel to further claim that the British public did not take to the film because we \"haven't come to terms with the trauma of her death\" is not only farcical, it borders on insulting. Obviously there was a huge reaction at the time of Diana's death, both nationally and internationally. I found her death exactly as sad as if any young mother of two had died in a car accident, though no more tragic than that, for the simple reason that this was tragic enough. As is well documented, others took it harder (some are still claiming that she was murdered, possibly during the fake moon landings or near a grassy knoll), but it's unlikely that many British people are \"traumatised\". Generally, we seem able to acknowledge our history without falling to pieces or hysterically refusing to enter cinemas to watch biopics. Does Hirschbiegel truly believe that, 16 years after Diana's death, the British public is shuffling around, swathed in black, weeping and wailing about the \"Queen of Hearts\", that, as a nation, we defy popular culture to try to portray her and boycott any films that dare? One can't help but wonder if Hirschbiegel has met many Brits: if he is aware of the questioning, refusenik, sparky, ironic side of the British character? Does he realise that we are \u2013 how to put this? \u2013 a bit lively? Or that, despite having a royal family, we are among the most irreverent people on Earth? While Hirschbiegel may have felt assured of critical veneration and big box office in this country, anyone could have told him that the UK was always destined to be the toughest market to crack. Not despite the fact that Diana was British and royal, but because of this. Indeed, British people were always going to have the most hypercritical reaction to any Diana movie. A case of \"we know this story, chum, so tell it properly\". This explains why Diana stiffed in the UK, as apparently it didn't in Poland, the Czech Republic, Turkey, and Slovakia (congrats on that). Nothing to do with Britain as a nation still being too traumatised about Princess Diana's death \u2013 give us some credit, we're not that feeble. In truth, British people are more than ready for an insightful, well-made film about Princess Diana, but this was not that insightful, well-made film. Don't dress up the Nazis as anything other than evil When I read that a schoolboy had been judged \"inappropriately\" dressing as Adolf Hitler for a school Second World War-themed day, I felt relieved. Not because of what happened to the boy (who just thought that someone should play Hitler); nor could his mother be blamed for being upset on his behalf. Then broadcaster Matthew Wright chimed in, ludicrously tweeting: \"Since when have Nazi outfits been a no-no?\" There have been previous attempts to remodel the Nazi uniform as palatable, restyling it as a sick fancy dress joke (most notably by Prince Harry), or as a costume for Halloween. However, this story showed that most people know the difference between an anti-PC jolly and being insensitive and ignorant. For most, Nazi regalia recalls a regime that was genocidal and antisemitic, which doesn't put a lot of people in the party mood, not least because antisemitism remains rife. Nazi clothing is still collected by fascist groups and they're not laughing. All of which may contribute to why the Nazi look is still considered toxic. It may also explain why we've preferred to leave send-ups to entertainers such as Charlie Chaplin, Mel Brooks and John Cleese. It's not that all mention of Nazism is banned, rather that, generally, people aren't interested in cheapening atrocities. So, \"since when\", Matthew? Well, since people felt queasy about diluting a world of pain down to a fake moustache and a swastika armband in a dressing-up box. Definitely a bit of a no-no. How 'other' people live their lives is none of our business According to new figures from the Office for National Statistics, 1.5% of people in Britain say that they are gay, lesbian or bisexual. Moreover, while younger people are more likely to say they're LGB, and men are twice as likely to self-identify as gay, 0.3% prefer to describe themselves as \"other\". Obviously, 1.5% is below the 6% estimated at the time that legislation was allowed for civil partnerships. Moreover, as it's 2013, why so shy, ladies and gentlemen, why so \"other\"? One would have thought that visibility was vital \u2013 the more, the louder, the better? The LGB charity Stonewall commented that some people may have found the questions inhibiting, particularly those who remember when homosexuality was criminalised or who still live in fear of attack. That's understandable. The fact that these are relatively more enlightened times may lead to the presumption that LGB people no longer suffer from prejudice or violence, which sadly is not the case. It could also be people of all sexual persuasions ticking the \"other\" box, making a deliberate point about refusing to be categorised or defined by their sexuality. A general feeling of why should anybody, gay or straight, have to \"out\" themselves for the sake of stats? However, the idea of many heterosexuals feeling this urge while filling in a form seems a tad unlikely. So indulge me in a little fantasy of a LGB person saying they are \"other\" just to be bloody-minded \u2013 as a way of telling the nosy, predominantly hetero mainstream to mind their own business. A cheeky little reminder that LGB people are human beings first and don't require tagging to keep abreast of numbers, like dolphins returned to the wild. While LGB visibility remains important, perhaps \"other\" is where it's at.
