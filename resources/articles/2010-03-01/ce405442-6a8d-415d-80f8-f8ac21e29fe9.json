They've got that just-stepped-off-of-an-indie-film-set look: Meredith is whippet-slim, with alabaster skin and burnished auburn hair, while David has the sculpted cheekbones and laconic self-possession of the young Chet Baker. They live in a suburb of LA with three dogs and two chickens. They'd like a goat for milk, and to keep bees; the idea of food self-sufficiency appeals, although within reason: \"I don't want my job to be 'farmer dude',\" says David. He does bits of graphic design work, they write songs together. So far, so Sunshine State normal, with all the eccentricity, holism and glamour that implies. But David and Meredith Metcalf have a secret. By night they rechristen themselves Kamer Maza and Gala (they pronounce it \"Gayla\") Bell, raid the dressing-up box and, with their co-conspirator Torg, transform into Music Go Music, a DayGlo reviviscence of 1970s pop so overblown it could make Scissor Sisters look folksy. Their debut album, Expressions, melds the energy and glitter of disco with outrageous prog-metal solos and the kind of soaring, emotional, unforgettable choruses that made Abba a global phenomenon, to create songs that will thrill the \"guilty pleasures\" brigade and horrify everyone who thinks this kind of rubbish has no place outside the charity shop bargain bin. Music Go Music could easily come across as a dreadful pastiche. But they're emphatic that it's not: \"There's no winking or snarky asides: there's a lot of funny stuff in the music, but it's not a joke,\" says David. Expressions, far from being dreadful, surges with a joy, an indecent yet innocent pleasure in major chords and untrammelled declarations of love and heartbreak, that is thoroughly contagious. Torg, otherwise known as producer and thrash-metal guitarist Adam Siegel, is sincere when he says that, playing with Music Go Music, \"I feel like I've been freed.\" There is a downside to this sense of abandonment: when we meet, Meredith has whiplash from compulsively headbanging during the band's show the night before (\"I wonder if Agnetha and Frida ever got whiplash,\" she muses). And Siegel, whose face is all but obscured by an ornate pair of 1970s glasses, is attempting to boost his immune system by dissolving a multivitamin tablet in the dregs of his Guinness. It's apparently quite effective. The trio first met at a party in 2006. Meredith jokes that what brought them together was \"lots of drugs\", before saying that what they truly bonded over was a shared admiration for Abba. She's scathing on the subject of people who claim they don't like Abba: \"I just think: how do you not? I know they haven't actually listened to it, they haven't really thought about it when they say it.\" At the time, Siegel was running a music studio, while the Metcalfs were struggling to record their debut album with their other band, Bodies of Water. For a lark, they decided to try collaborating on an unabashed, Abba-style pop song. The result, Light of Love, emerged with preposterous speed. \"It was crazy,\" says Siegel. \"I'd never experienced anything like it: it was written and recorded in a day.\" They've tried to stick to that blueprint ever since. \"We want the songs to be immediate and accessible,\" says David, \"and, by definition, immediacy comes from something that appears to you right off the bat, that you work on efficiently and make quick decisions about.\" Abba aside, the trio have been surprised by some of the other comparisons that have been hurled at them \u2013 not least because many of them are unfamiliar to the Metcalfs. \"I've never listened to the Doobie Brothers,\" says David, drily. In fact, he hadn't even heard Abba until he was an adult. \"I don't have any baggage with that kind of music because I didn't grow up with it,\" he says. His father was \"aggressively uninterested in music: if a Beatles song came on the radio he'd have no idea who it was by.\" That may or may not have had something to do with the fact that David's \"crazy\" grandmother forced Metcalf senior to play piano as a child, and would thwack his hands with a ruler if he struck a wrong note. The absence of pop in the household turned David into an unconventional teenager. \"I was really into ragtime, then I got into Gershwin and Mozart when I was about 14,\" he says. Lately, he's been exploring his local library's jazz collection. Meredith has mixed feelings about that: \"There was a period when our house was filled with jazz and it was starting to feel really cerebral. I thought: I don't want my husband to be the kind of guy who says [adopts highbrow tone], 'I just need to relax and listen to jazz.'\" Her upbringing was more typical: her parents loved classic rock; her father plays various folk instruments; her mother sings. \"Whatever was playing on the radio, she would harmonise with it \u2013 it used to drive me crazy.\" Yet her parents abhorred 1970s pop. \"They didn't have any disco. Roxy Music was as fancy as it got.\" The Metcalfs dub Siegel \"the pop guy\" \u2013 he brings \"more of the major melodies and the heavy metal stuff\" to the Music Go Music mix. David, meanwhile, writes all of the lyrics for Meredith to sing. What's odd about this is that half of the songs erupt with the torrid exhilaration of new love, the rest bewail the trauma of being abandoned by love in a bleak world where \"even the jasmine scent is stale\" \u2013 and the Metcalfs have been quietly married for almost nine years, since they met at the age of \"19 or 20\". \"Um, well, everybody's had love crises of one sort or another,\" David says evasively. For Meredith, singing his lyrics is equivalent to acting in a play \u2013 and David is \"my favourite writer. I did a guest vocal for another band recently and it was really weird singing someone else's lyrics.\" They are a tight-knit couple. \"We've always done everything together,\" says Meredith. \"We've restored houses together, we're always taking on some huge project together. I feel like I store information in his brain \u2013 he's like my hard drive.\" And although she doesn't spell it out, she's perfectly aware what happened to the two marriages in Abba once that quartet became famous, and is determined that her relationship shouldn't suffer the same fate. \"Lately we've been talking about how we need to figure out a working schedule: songwriting is what we do for recreation, too, so while it's awesome that we get to share what we like doing the most, we need to know that these are our hours for working, so it's not 24 hours. You can ruin relationships with too much stress. And when people get successful, they can get so busy and crazy that they can't even do what they set out to do, which is to make music.\" That's partly why they didn't rush to release the Music Go Music album (it was originally mooted for spring last year), and why they plan to spend the next few months concentrating on Bodies of Water. In some ways, the two bands are quite different: the Bodies of Water sound is much more experimental, less pop and more prog, with a strong gospel influence in the four-part vocal harmonies. What both projects share is a spiritual intensity \u2013 religious in Bodies of Water (the Metcalfs are Mennonites), secular in Music Go Music. There are other projects in the pipeline, too: for Siegel, an outfit dubbed Jam Cottage, and for the Metcalfs, joining forces with some friends to form the Physical Jerks, who, says David, \"will sound exactly like the name would indicate, causing really rapid movement\". For Meredith, having these other bands as a \"counterpoint\" to Music Go Music is vital: they can feed off each other. \"And this kind of pop music, it's more indulgent,\" she says. \"You just can't do it all of the time or it doesn't make sense. It has to be more special.\" Expressions is released on Mercury/Secretly Canadian on 19 April"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
