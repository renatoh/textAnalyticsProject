Petr Drul\u00e1k, the Czech Republic\u2019s ambassador to France, told public television he visited the 90-year-old author in his Paris apartment last Thursday to hand deliver his citizenship certificate. \u201cThis is a very important symbolic gesture, a symbolic return of the greatest Czech writer in the Czech Republic,\u201d Drul\u00e1k said, describing the presentation as \u201ca very simple moment, but of great conviviality and human warmth\u201d. \u201cHe was in a good mood, just took the document and said thank you,\u201d he added. Kundera, author of internationally acclaimed fiction, was expelled for \u201canti-communist activities\u201d from the Czechoslovakian party in 1950. He became a hate figure for the authorities and eventually fled to France in 1975. In 1979, his Czech citizenship was revoked and two years later he became a French citizen. His most famous works, including The Unbearable Lightness of Being and The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, were written in France and banned in his homeland until the late 80s. His 1988 novel Immortality was his last novel written in Czech; he has since written four more novels in French, the most recent 2014\u2019s The Festival of Insignificance. The idea of restoring Kundera\u2019s citizenship has been floated for years by authorities in the Czech Republic. In November 2018, prime minister Andrej Babi\u0161 announced that he had offered to restore the author and his wife Vera\u2019s citizenship after a three-hour meeting with them in their favourite Paris restaurant. \u201cIt was a great honour for me,\u201d Babi\u0161 wrote at the time, describing Kundera, who is often cited as a contender for the Nobel prize in literature, as a legend of Czech, French and world literature. He said he had invited the Kunderas to visit the Czech Republic, but said the novelist\u2019s response was non-committal. Kundera now lives out of the spotlight and never speaks to reporters. After visiting his homeland in 1996 for the first time since he fled, Kundera has reportedly returned a number of times, but travels incognito. In a 1984 interview with the New York Times, Kundera said that the idea of home was \u201csomething very ambiguous\u201d for him. \u201cI wonder if our notion of home isn\u2019t, in the end, an illusion, a myth. I wonder if we are not victims of that myth. I wonder if our ideas of having roots \u2013 d\u2019\u00eatre enracin\u00e9 \u2013 is simply a fiction we cling to,\u201d he said, adding that he had made the choice between living \u201clike an \u00e9migr\u00e9 in France or like an ordinary person who happens to write books\u201d. \u201cDo I consider my life in France as a replacement, a substitute life, and not a real life? Do I say to myself: \u2018Your real life is in Czechoslovakia, among your old countrymen\u2019? \u2026 Or do I accept my life in France \u2013 here where I really am \u2013 as my real life and try to live it fully? I chose France,\u201d he said. In 2008, Kundera was awarded the Czech national prize for literature but did not return to receive it. In 2009, he was awarded honorary citizenship of Brno, the city where he was born in 1929, but the author remained in France. That same year, he refused to attend a conference in Brno dedicated to his work, sending a letter to the organisers that jokingly described the occasion as a \u201cnecrophile party\u201d. In the letter, which was read at the event\u2019s opening, Kundera described himself as a French writer, and insisted that his books should be considered French literature and categorised as such in bookshops."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
