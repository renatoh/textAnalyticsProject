The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, said the army's Spearhead Lead Company Group, drawn from the Royal Gurkha regiment, has been deployed in neighbouring Ghana to assist the operation. The development follows the outbreak of violence at the weekend in the main city, Abidjan, aimed at French peacekeepers in the former French colony. Mr Hoon said in a Commons statement that the government placed \"the utmost priority\" on protecting its citizens, whether at home or abroad. \"We are always prepared to deploy British forces to evacuate UK nationals should their lives be placed in jeopardy,\" he said. \"In light of the deteriorating security situation in Ivory Coast, a military reconnaissance team was deployed earlier this week to assess the requirement to evacuate UK nationals. \"Following this reconnaissance, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has requested British forces to undertake an evacuation of UK nationals and others over the next few days.\" Mr Hoon said some 400 people in the country were entitled to the protection of British forces, and the evacuation would involve 300 personnel and a number of RAF transport aircraft. \"We would expect the operation to last days, not weeks,\" he said. The Gurkhas flew into Accra, the capital of Ghana, last night where they are on \"immediate notice\" to move into Ivory Coast to support the evacuation if required. As an \"additional contingency\", the assault ship HMS Albion has been redirected towards Ivory Coast. France, which has 14,000 nationals in the country, has already begun an evacuation of hundreds of foreigners. Convoys sent out by the US embassy have been gathering up foreigners ready to leave, while state television station alternately appealed for calm and for a mass uprising against the French. The president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, announced he would be hosting emergency peace talks in Pretoria in a bid to defuse the crisis. Violence broke out at the weekend when Ivory Coast warplanes killed nine French peacekeepers and an American aid worker in an air strike on the rebel-held north of the country, in violation of a year-long ceasefire. France retaliated by attacking and destroying Ivory Coast's newly created airforce on the ground. The action sparked a violent uprising by pro-government youths, who took to the streets with machetes, iron bars and clubs. At least 27 people are reported to have been killed and more than 900 injured in the disturbances. A Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, Paul Keetch, said: \"The deployment of Gurkhas and Royal Navy assets to the Ivory Coast demonstrates again the need to maintain a flexible armed force. \"The government should put on hold any reorganisation of our infantry battalions until at least the Iraq operation is concluded.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
