Meanwhile, Damian \"Jr Gong\" Marley's heritage speaks of a considerable artistry and spiritual questing. Their collaborative album Distant Relatives, the proceeds of which will go to build schools in Africa, is a felicitous mix of Marley's reggae/Ethiopiques-influenced productions and Nas's aggrieved underdog flow, making for some of the most profanity-laced, vaguely paranoid do-gooding around. Five years on from Welcome To Jamrock, it at least helps to answer what Marley's been up to in the meantime. Manchester Academy, Fri John Robinson The Proms, London When the annual prospectus of the Proms is published, it always takes a while to judge the offerings at the self-styled \"world's biggest music festival\". So, the lack of standout concerts and paucity of world-class visiting orchestras this year \u2013 the Berlin Philharmonic apart \u2013 plus an underwhelming choice of new works, are not reasons to dismiss the season. There's plenty to savour: cycles of Beethoven piano concertos, Mahler symphonies and Scriabin orchestral works, and a celebration of Henry Wood, plus a spectacular opening weekend. After Jir\u00ed Belohl\u00e1vek opens with Mahler's Eighth Symphony on Friday, Welsh National Opera brings Wagner's Die Meistersinger to the Albert Hall, followed a day later by the Royal Opera with Verdi's Simon Boccanegra. Bryn Terfel stars in the former, Placido Domingo in the latter; that can't be too bad. Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Fri to 11 Sep Andrew Clements Klaxons, Glasgow, Manchester What does the new raver do when new rave gets old? Of course: he goes nu-metal. That, up to a point, is the Klaxons formula. Rather than adhere to the accelerated pop of their Mercury Prize-winning Myths Of The Near Future album, for their second, they've enlisted hard rock producer Ross Robinson and a sound vaguely reminiscent of Enter Shikari. A rum do all round, especially since Klaxons have already had one album rejected because it wasn't \"pop enough\". Still, there may be method in their madness: even if Surfing The Void is shorter on killer tunes, they may have escaped one genre to leap into the arms of another and, like the Prodigy, become a dance act it's OK for rockers to like. King Tut's, Glasgow, Tue; Ruby Lounge, Manchester, Wed John Robinson Wichita 10th Anniversary Series, London When Creation Records ceased trading, the main players formed new labels. Alan McGee started an imprint called Poptones; Dick Green and Mark Bowen founded Wichita Recordings. It's down to their solid indie tastemaking \u2013 Wichita artists have included Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Bloc Party \u2013 that it's their label and not McGee's that's now celebrating a decade in business. New talent is the lifeblood of any label, so here you'll find Those Dancing Days (Mon), the wonderful Meg Baird (Tue), and Los Campesinos! (Thu), but there's also one hardy perennial on display here. During their tenure at Wichita, The Cribs (Wed) have grown from a stout indie band with an insane fan base into a stout indie band with Johnny Marr in their ranks \u2013 and that's got to be worth seeing. Relentless Garage, N5, Mon to Thu John Robinson Pat Metheny Group, London When he was in London for his one-man-band Orchestrion gig in February, guitar star Metheny joked that he sees the Barbican audience more often than he sees his relatives. He's back with his own road band for this show, and later in the month with vibraphonist Gary Burton's Quartet Revisited. But although Metheny's appetite for work and taxingly different musical settings seems inexhaustible, he sustains a remarkable inventiveness, and a relaxed attitude. The Pat Metheny Group first took to the road in 1978, and their mellifluous jazz improvisation and melodic Latin and country-tinged themes made them an immediate hit both with the jazz public, and a crossover audience. The Group's been a constant undercurrent in Metheny's prolific career ever since, and this version \u2013 mixing old and new material \u2013 features long-time members Lyle Mays (piano) and Steve Rodby (bass) plus the propulsive Antonio Sanchez on drums. Barbican Hall, EC2, Sat John Fordham Bernstein's Mass, London Throughout the 2009-10 season at the Southbank Centre, conductor Marin Alsop has presided over the Bernstein Project, a series of events bringing together professional and amateur singers and instrumentalists, leading up to performances this weekend of the multimedia Mass by Leonard Bernstein. First performed in 1971 at the opening of New York's Kennedy Centre, Mass is one of Bernstein's most ambitious and problematic works, mixing both musical styles and professional and amateur performers, and uniting them in a massive theatrical act of ecumenical celebration. It's proved difficult to sustain in performance, but Alsop just might be the conductor to do it: she has the forces of the Mass Orchestra (a collection of youth orchestra players), as well as vocal soloists, rock and marching bands, a local community choir and a troupe of dancers. It should be quite a spectacle, at least. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Sat, Sun Andrew Clements"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
