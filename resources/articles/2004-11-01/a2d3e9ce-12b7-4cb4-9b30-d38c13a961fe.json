A delegation from Dundee, Angus, Perth and Kinross and Fife called on the minister to end the continuing uncertainty over the future of the regiment. After nearly an hour of talks in Whitehall, Lord Provost John Letford of Dundee said he was \"only moderately encouraged\" by meeting Mr Hoon. \"It was a nice exchange of dialogue from both sides and Mr Hoon put forward his points of view, as we did ours,\" Mr Letford said. Mr Hoon announced plans in July to cut Scotland's six historic infantry regiments to five before merging them into a single unit. It is thought that the five remaining regiments would keep their names as battalions within a \"super regiment\", possibly called the royal Scottish regiment. The government is expected to make an announcement on the future make-up of the armed forces under the review before Christmas. Mr Letford said that while he was not sure whether there had been any change in Mr Hoon's position, there were points that may be looked into. \"We need to sit down and analyse what was said to us. There were one or two items we discussed which were of interest to him. If the identity of the Black Watch was retained within some structure, yes, I'm certain we would be happy with that,\" he said. Provost Bob Scott of Perth and Kinross said he appreciated that Mr Hoon had seen the delegation and allowed them to express their view as representatives of the people in the Black Watch area. \"He also took the opportunity to voice his vision of what the future should be. There is some fine tuning still to be done but I think it is fair to say the status quo is no longer an option,\" he said. \"The overall regimental system of Scotland is not going to remain as it is. There is going to be change and the Black Watch will be part of that change but hopefully the names remain in that structure.\" Speaking before the meeting in the Commons, Mr Hoon said that it was vital to modernise the armed forces and that changes to regiments should not affect their local identity or \"esprit de corps\" but make them stronger and more flexible. The world was changing and it was essential the armed forces changed to meet the new challenges, Mr Hoon said. He added that Tory attacks on the government's plans to modernise showed their policies \"risked turning our armed forces into a museum piece\". The delegation of civic leaders that met Mr Hoon also included Provost Bill Middleton of Angus and Provost John Simpson of Fife. It was thought to be the first time all four local authorities in the Black Watch regimental area have united to lobby Whitehall on a single issue. Some 550 members of the Black Watch regiment are currently deployed at Camp Dogwood in central Iraq after they were moved from the Basra area this month. Four soldiers from the regiment have been killed and more than a dozen injured since they arrived at their new base near the so-called \"triangle of death\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
