But given the opportunity to break into advertising with a top 10 London agency, the temptation to slice four years off my age, take on a pseudonym and \"audition\" with the best of them proved too great. Last Monday TBWA, whose attention-grabbing campaigns have included FCUK, the Labour Party's general election work and Gossard's \"Hello Boys\" strapline, opened its doors to graduate all comers. Adstars, their take on the TV hit Popstars, was going to revolutionise TBWA's graduate recruitment campaign for its September 2002 intake, it claimed. Just turn up with a CV and wait your turn - you'll get three minutes in front of a top-flight panel to talk about something you feel passionate about. If the panel think you could cut it in the ad world you'll be asked to hang around for a 15-minute interview. If you fail to impress, you're out. By the time I turn up at 10.15am, the TBWA reception is bursting with wannabe account management trainees. \"When we opened at 9am, people were queuing around the block,\" says the girl who takes my CV and a Polaroid, then gives me a sticker showing my name and number. \"Take a seat and help yourself to food and drink.\" I've decided to be Lucy Collins, who is two years, rather than six years, out of Durham University. Lucy's CV reads as mine did four years ago - with obvious alterations to dates. (Well, you want the inside story, don't you?) The TBWA graduate intake of the last three years, all wearing bright yellow \"Adstars\" T-shirts, are acting as runners today, shepherding their would-be successors between waiting rooms - ritual humiliation and exit points. I sit down next to Maria who's just graduated from King's College London with a 2:1 in English. \"What number are you - 99? I'm 58. They're on 30 at the moment - it's going to be a long wait.\" A cross-section of graduate life is waiting with us. No mature students, though: the publicity for this event specified TBWA was looking for young graduates. Suspended from the ceiling are profiles of the people of today's panel members. They're white, predominantly Oxbridge and seem frighteningly successful. I'm 28 and employed, but still finding this all very nerve-racking. Serena had just graduated from London Guildhall in psychology and marketing. \"My philosophy is that you have to understand someone before you can sell something to them,\" she explains. She looks the part in a sophisticated black suit with slicked black hair and well-shaped eyebrows. \"My passion is challenge,\" she says. \"But I'm not going to talk about it - I'm going to demonstrate it. I'm going to sell them my mother's spoon collection.\" Around the room, people are clutching various props: musical instruments, photographs mounted on card, bits of bicycle. There's a tannoy announcement: \"Can numbers 31-40 come forward, please?\" The next nine victims are shown to the lifts. \"We haven't actually seen anyone come down and leave the building yet,\" says Serena ominously. An older man in a suit comes over to our table and tells us not to look so nervous. \"You'll get a job somewhere if you keep plugging away,\" he says. \"It's all about getting the right agency fit. I was rejected from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and looking back that was the right decision.\" What's the difference? I ask. \"Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was more show, more aggressive, a young agency,\" he says. \"I eventually got a job at JWT which was much more considered - a multinational agency that was right for me.\" The man explains that TBWA tried traditional \"milkround\" recruitment earlier in the year and has taken on three graduates from 1,200 applications. \"But I wasn't overly impressed with the standard of applications so we thought we'd try this. No one's ever done it before and we don't know how it will work out but it's looking good so far.\" Who are you? I wonder in awe. \"Oh, I'm the MD. Good luck. Take it easy - and just be yourself.\" I wonder whether I will get evicted for not recognising Andrew McGuinness. Mark McGinn has just finished a degree in politics and philosophy at Durham. \"I'm talking on nature - it's a bit pretentious,\" he smiles apologetically. \"Have you seen him?\" he gestures towards a candidate standing outside who gesturing wildly at a cluster of mopeds. \"He's been going through it like that for half an hour and seems oblivious to the people staring at him in the office block opposite - or he's totally without embarrassment.\" The tannoy asks for 41-50: fellow comrades shakes hands and wish each other luck as though they're going over the top. \"She's doing bread,\" says Maria, pointing at one girl. Maria's passion is people who aren't passionate. \"I cancelled a holiday to Barcelona and lost my deposit to be here,\" she says. \"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity - being here is more important.\" It's midday before they call 51-60. I get chatting to moped man, Adam Jacques, a Warwick history and politics graduate who seems remarkably normal. \"I'm trying to get it word perfect without being parrot fashion,\" he smiles. \"I'm talking about a drinking game - it's a super-fast way of drinking an alcopop so you get a sugar rush and alcohol hit, all at the same time.\" He's sitting with Fiona who's going to speak on dirty kitchens. At 12.30pm, TBWA lays on trays of sandwiches and announces the panel is taking a lunch break. By this time the flow of candidates coming into reception has slowed to a trickle. TBWA has had around 160 graduates through its doors today so the odds of any of us getting a job are significantly higher than if we filled in their application form with 1,200 others earlier in the year. This process seems to have attracted a wider range of universities although their office location has obviously favoured chancers in London and the southeast. By 2.30pm, I've read the last six months of TBWA press cuttings and have watched their agency showreel a dozen times. Then I spot Maria and Serena on their way out and they come over to say hello. Both got through to the interview stage and are buzzing. \"They're going to call us tomorrow to tell us if we've made it through to the workshop stage,\" says Serena. \"They're looking for maybe 16 graduates to ask back. It's all about aura - they either love you or hate you. But they're all really nice.\" \"Just be yourself,\" pipes in Maria encouragingly. \"You'll be fine.\" By the time they call my number, I've been waiting for five hours and two of the graduates in the 91-100 segment have left already. We're taken to an annexe room and wait to be called. A TBWA graduate trainee is going round with a video camera. \"The idea is that we're making a promotional film - we may even email it to all you guys,\" he explains. At 3.30pm, I'm ushered into a room and asked to stand on the cross before a panel. I have three minutes. I'm passionate about using my vote. It seems to be over in seconds. The panel smile politely and don't give anything away. It occurs to me that they're spending just as much time reading my CV as they are listening to what I have to say. The process is ruthless. I make my way back to the annex room where I am told we will receive envelopes telling us how we've done. Most will say \"thanks but no thanks\" But the others will be asked to hang around for an interview. I watch on as others look delighted or despondent - some practically in tears. I open my envelope... I'm through! \"Congratulations,\" says a yellow T-shirt who escorts me through to meet my very own nasty Nigel. \u00b7 See whether Sarah is offered the job in next week's Rise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
