The popularity of \u201chaul culture\u201d, the ubiquity of Primark on high streets and the rise of ultra-low-cost online retailers has got the British public hooked on fast fashion. But it is entirely unsustainable. We send \u00a3140m of clothing to landfill every year in the UK, much of it made by workers scratching a subsistence wage in poor conditions in countries such as Cambodia and Sri Lanka. And the environmental cost is ruinous: the fashion industry is the world\u2019s second biggest polluter, after the oil industry. There is, however, evidence that this era may be drawing to a close. It is estimated that the secondhand or resale market could be bigger than fast fashion within a decade as we become more aware of the social and environmental impact of cheap clothes. And the slow-fashion movement \u2013 encouraging people to buy ethically made items of clothing sparingly, repair them when necessary and keep them for life \u2013 is growing in popularity. Here, we asked Guardian readers if they were slow fashion pioneers and to share the much-loved items that have been in their wardrobes for years. Sunita Yeomans, 50, a graphic designer from Olney, has worn the same pair of denim dungarees since the 1980s I was ridiculously shy when I was younger. When I went to art college in 1988, I realised I needed to come out of my shell so made a real effort to make friends. One day, a student called Mike invited me to a fashion party. It was brilliant fun. Lots of people were staying over, so I did, too, but the next morning I reverted to being shy Sunita. When I left, everyone burst out laughing at this weird girl Mike had invited. The next time I saw Mike I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I said: \u201cI love your dungarees.\u201d He told me I could have them and I\u2019ve worn them ever since. I adore them. I met my husband, Simon, at college. We\u2019ve been together for 30 years and married for 26. After we\u2019d been dating for two weeks, he took me to meet his family. I wore the dungarees because I was nervous \u2013 I come from a culture where most of my cousins had arranged marriages \u2013 and I felt as if I could hide in them. Dungarees are workwear, so they never go out of fashion, and these ones are good quality. I normally wear them when I\u2019m doing DIY or painting. Every time I pop them on, all the memories of my life with Simon come back. I guess you could say they\u2019re my happy dungarees. Lally MacBeth, 28, an artist from Cornwall, stumbled across a dress in a Brighton vintage shop \u2013 donated by her mother years earlier In 2016, I was in Brighton, visiting my cousin for the day. We went vintage shopping in the Lanes. I saw this dress and felt drawn to the print \u2013 it was a strange feeling. I didn\u2019t have much money, so I tried it on and then left the shop to think about it. I called Mum for advice. She said: \u201cThat sounds really similar to a dress that I had once and gave away.\u201d I decided to buy it, just to show her. I sent her a photo and she replied: \u201cOh, my God. It\u2019s the dress.\u201d She had been given it by a friend who had bought it in the 1970s in Dublin. It\u2019s by a designer called Susan Small. We found a photo of my mum wearing it in the 1990s. When I saw it, it triggered something in my memory. I was pretty sure I\u2019d seen a dress like it on eBay, so I went into my watched items and there it was: same print, same designer, but a slightly different version. It turns out my mum had actually owned two of the dresses and given them both away. It\u2019s a crazy coincidence. I was drawn to the dress because of deep-rooted nostalgia. My mum always wore those types of dresses when we were kids. When I realised the connection, it felt meaningful. A lot of my love for vintage fashion comes from her. In the photo, she\u2019s wearing the dress with a pair of Hobbs shoes from 1989, which I also have. So now I have the exact same outfit. Kim Wong, 55, from Manchester, runs a business teaching English as a foreign language. He has worn a jumper his mother knitted for him for 37 years When I was at university, my bedroom was so cold in the winter that I would often find ice inside the windows. My mum said: \u201cI\u2019ll knit you a jumper.\u201d That was 37 years ago, and that jumper has stayed with me throughout all the highs and lows of my life. In its heyday, it was really warm and fluffy. I\u2019d wear it when I was studying and I couldn\u2019t afford to put the heating on. It\u2019s not so fluffy now, but it\u2019s only in the past year that I\u2019ve had to start patching it up. I asked my mum if she could repair it. She had a go, but said it was beyond her \u2013 she didn\u2019t have the time and patience, or the wool. It\u2019s funny to think it will have only cost her a few pounds to make and that it has lasted this long. If I were to buy a jumper like it, it would cost a lot more, and likely wouldn\u2019t last. Fashion these days changes so quickly. I see people updating their look all the time, and I think how big is your closet? Paul Peppiate, 58, is a design manager from Embsay, North Yorkshire. He has worn his \u2018indestructible\u2019 green socks for 28 years When I was younger, I used to go walking a lot and my socks would always go into holes. My mum said to me: \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a company that makes indestructible socks?\u201d When I bought them, from HJ Hall, they looked like normal socks to me. But, 28 years on, I\u2019m still wearing them. I wore them on my wedding day. I don\u2019t think I consciously decided to keep them as a keepsake, but the longer I had them, the more they felt like a memory of the day. They\u2019re like a talisman \u2013 I\u2019ve had them all the time that we\u2019ve been happily married. Indestructible socks equal an indestructible marriage. I treasure things that I\u2019ve had for some time, and these socks fall into that category. Other generations of socks have been and gone, but when I open my drawer, they\u2019re always there: a reliable presence in an unreliable world. Hel Loader, 55, a nut farmer from Whanganui, New Zealand, has worn her favourite blue dress on adventures around the world I bought this dress on Cuba Street in central Wellington when I was 25. There was a stall selling tie-dyed batik outfits. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw this incredible ultramarine blue. I thought: \u201cThat will be easy to wear in summer.\u201d After I bought the dress, I met Scott. He lived in Auckland and, as I lived in Wellington, we had a long-distance relationship for a while. Scott and I both had stressful jobs so we loved to take weekends off and travel around New Zealand. The dress quickly became associated with holidays. Later on, Scott would come home from a stressful day and say: \u201cI\u2019ve had enough.\u201d So we\u2019d chuck a few things in a bag and off we\u2019d go. I\u2019d always bring the dress because if it got crushed or crumpled, the creases would fall right out. Whenever I\u2019d prepare for a trip, Scott always checked to make sure I\u2019d packed it. He liked the colour. Scott wanted to explore the world and we started taking longer trips. In 2000, we spent six months travelling around Central America and the dress came with us. I could wear it hiking or at the end of the day when we went for a beer and a meal. It was just a simple thing: I didn\u2019t have to worry what I looked like because the dress was bright and cheerful, and that\u2019s how I felt. When I look at photos from that trip, I see a young woman, madly in love, looking at the man she loves without a care in the world and her life stretching before her. Before Scott died of pancreatic cancer in 2017, he asked me to scatter his ashes at Cape Finisterre in Spain. It was a special place for Scott \u2013 we had travelled there in 2008. In Roman times, they thought Cape Finisterre was the end of the world. Scott liked that. So I packed the dress, flew to Spain and tipped the bugger off a cliff, just like he wanted. Scott and I always saw ourselves as a great love story. He used to tell me that he loved me without measure or restraint. The dress represents all the times we had together. But it\u2019s just a scrap of fabric, really. When I bought it, I didn\u2019t think any of that. Now, when I come home from the farm and I\u2019m tired, I have a shower and put it on. It still fits, although it\u2019s a bit more snug now and a little worn, but it\u2019s as bright and blue and happy as it ever was. Petra Tilly, 57, is a play therapist, from Dartmoor. She has treasured an Edwardian jacket for most of her adult life I grew up on a hill farm in Dartmoor, the youngest of three children. I used to wear my siblings\u2019 hand-me-downs, but I loved dressing up. My grandmother gave me these 1930s evening gowns and I\u2019d wander around the farmyard with them dragging in the mud. When I was 17, I went to art school in Plymouth. I used to spend a lot of time vintage shopping \u2013 I loved the hunt. This Edwardian jacket was the first vintage piece I ever bought. I\u2019d wear it with patched-up old Levi\u2019s, or over a dress. It was an exciting time: I was just heading out into the world and everything seemed possible. After I finished my degree, I met an older man who was very interesting, but also abusive and controlling. He would often tell me what I could and couldn\u2019t wear. The only way to escape was to throw some clothes in a bag and run away with my son, which is how I found myself a single parent in the mid-1980s. Money was tight and I had to sell my vintage clothing collection to make ends meet. But I couldn\u2019t bear to sell the jacket. It was a bit of the old me, from before I met him. It held the memory of my younger, flamboyant, art-student self. I wore the jacket when my husband and I got married, on Dartmoor, in 1995. I had to wear it, because it had seen me through good times and bad \u2013 and my wedding was a particularly special and joyous time for me. Even though the jacket\u2019s looking a bit tatty now, I still wouldn\u2019t part with it. Pete Maclean, 68, is a software developer, who lives in Virginia. He bought his three-piece red suit in New York in the 1970s I moved to New York in the 1970s as a student before getting a job at New York University. I saw this suit in the window of a shop on 8th Street and it just yelled to me that I had to buy it. Because I\u2019m so tall and thin, it can be hard for me to find clothes, but when I tried it on, it fitted perfectly. I was living it up at the time. I had a very fulfilling job, a good social life and I\u2019d go out to the disco. It was one of the happier periods of my life. I grew up in Scotland, but I\u2019d been courageous and taken myself to the US. Things had worked out for me and I was very grateful. The suit was a symbol of how I\u2019d built the life for myself that I wanted. If I could go back in time to that period, I\u2019d whisper to myself: \u201cYou\u2019re doing great. Just keep it up. It\u2019s going to be wonderful.\u201d I\u2019ve had the suit since I was 28 and I\u2019m reluctant to get rid of it because I\u2019d never be able to find one like it again. It\u2019s as good as new \u2013 I still wear it occasionally, although not as much as I did in the 1970s. As I get older I grow less attached to material things. I throw things out because I want to make my life leaner. It\u2019s just a few things and a few people that are really valuable that I hold on to \u2013 the others fall off the edges and I let them go. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2019 to correct a misspelling of the family name of Paul Peppiate as Peppiatt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
