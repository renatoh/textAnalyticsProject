Top stories Human destruction of the living world is causing a \u201cfrightening\u201d number of plant extinctions, according to scientists who have completed the first global analysis of plant species. The researchers said the plant extinction rate was 500 times greater now than before the industrial revolution, and this was likely to be an underestimate. They found 571 species had been wiped out since 1750 but, with knowledge of many plant species still very limited, the true number is likely to be much higher. \u201cIt is way more than we knew and way more than should have gone extinct,\u201d said Dr Maria Vorontsova of the Royal Botanic Gardens in London. Laws that target price-gouging energy companies should be extended to all big businesses, the Nationals MP Keith Pitt has said, endorsing a Centre Alliance push to legislate an economy-wide power to break up big companies when parliament returns in July. The Queensland National has been one of the most vocal advocates of the \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation, which allows energy companies to be broken up if they engage in price gouging. But the government should be able to steer the package through the lower house without amendments, unless Pitt is joined by more Nationals colleagues. The Indigenous rapper Briggs says the Australian public is not attached to the national anthem because it is only 35 years old and the \u201csong\u2019s just not that good\u201d. Appearing on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday, Briggs was asked about his video for the Weekly in which he said the anthem \u201csucks\u201d and sought to explain what it \u201csounds like when blackfellas listen to it\u201d. The video sparked a critical front-page news story in the West Australian newspaper but on Monday night Briggs dismissed the backlash, saying he tried to push himself out of his comfort zone because \u201cchange doesn\u2019t come from being comfortable\u201d. World A helicopter has crashed on the roof of a skyscraper in midtown Manhattan, killing one person, reportedly the pilot, and sparking panic in New York. Canada will ban harmful single-use plastics as early as 2021, Justin Trudeau said on Monday. Items to be banned may include water bottles, plastic bags and straws. The final list of candidates for the leadership of the UK Conservative party has been reduced to 10, with Michael Gove mounting a strong attack on the favourite, Boris Johnson. Voting begins on Thursday. Google made $4.7bn in advertising from news content last year, almost as much as the revenue of the entire online news industry. Egyptian authorities are trying to stop the auction of a statue of Tutankhamun\u2019s head after concerns were raised that the bust might have been stolen from the Karnak temple in Luxor. David Mamet and Steven Berkoff are among the artists using the Harvey Weinstein case as material. \u201cFor these guys I guess rape and harassment is some kind of interesting philosophical exercise they feel they need first bite at,\u201d writes Suzanne Moore. \u201cImagine that Weinstein is actually not that interesting. Imagine that, given the #MeToo movement, women playwrights might do something with this material beyond \u2018dark farce\u2019 \u2026 This is not farce, it is real life, and the contents of Weinstein\u2019s mind are not as deep or interesting as any of these guys think. They are sordid and ordinary. A real dramatist might grasp this.\u201d \u201cNothing about the election result has changed the fundamental picture of the economy,\u201d writes Greg Jericho. \u201cAs it is, the latest figures on the housing market suggest any improvement had started before the election result, but we should be pretty wary about getting overly excited \u2013 when we talk improvement we really mean \u2018less bad\u2019. The latest housing finance figures, released on Friday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, show that the value of housing finance commitments in April was 19% below what they were a year earlier.\u201d Sport Goals were hard to come by in the women\u2019s World Cup overnight, with Japan and Argentina playing out a 0-0 draw, and Canada edging past Cameroon 1-0. Sebastian Vettel knew what he was doing when he incurred the penalty that cost him first place at Sunday\u2019s Canadian Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton has said. Hamilton won after the stewards penalised the German by adding five seconds to his time. Thinking time: \u201cPeople keep asking if you have closure\u201d When Mark Longley\u2019s daughter Emily was 17, she was strangled by her ex-boyfriend. No one around him knew what to do or say. \u201cI was in a weird paradox where I felt isolated and I wanted human contact, but people didn\u2019t know how to talk to me,\u201d the New Zealander says. \u201cThe journalist in me thought this was interesting and I wanted to examine it.\u201d The decade Longley has spent grappling with grief has found its way into a podcast, which he hopes will function as a how-to guide for anyone struggling with the death of a loved one \u2013 or struggling to talk to someone in mourning. He spoke to Eleanor Ainge-Roy about Emily, grief, domestic violence and the false promise of closure \u2013 which he calls \u201ca load of rubbish\u201d. \u201cDeath is the atom bomb [for] emotions; if your internal wounds were visible you\u2019d be rushed to hospital and you\u2019d be in intensive care,\u201d says Longley. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about death; there\u2019s no duck, cover and hold routine. We know what to do in an earthquake but we don\u2019t know what to say or do if someone dies. We are kind of awkward about it. It\u2019s like a bad Monty Python sketch.\u201d Although Emily was killed in the UK, Longley\u2019s research into domestic violence has centred on his home of New Zealand, which has one of the worst rates of intimate partner violence in the OECD. Media roundup Top of the Sydney Morning Herald this morning is the $850m cost in revenue forgone of the Berejiklian government\u2019s housing package, which aims to help first-home buyers enter the market.
