That was not enough for Somerset to win the game. They appeared on course for victory while Nick Compton and Marcus Trescothick were adding 99 together in pursuit of 178. But Essex, even without the services of ten Doeschate, kept their cool while the Somerset batsmen did not. The pressure mounted; the batsmen lost composure and heaved, the fielders hung on to the offerings; the run-outs were taken and Essex clinched victory by 10 runs. The way in which ten Doeschate hobbled from the pitch, aided by team-mates, suggests he will be missing from the Essex line-up for some time. It was later confirmed that ten Doeschate had suffered a torn calf muscle that is likely to keep him out for six weeks. Ten Doeschate, who had, yet again, been the cornerstone of the Essex innings, pulled up as he was trying to complete a single. He could have been run out but Kieran Pollard did not bother. It was immediately obvious that ten Doeschate would not be able to continue. Even so Essex were able to post a substantial target against a Somerset side, which has been batting better on paper than on grass in recent times. But the total would surely have been larger if ten Doeschate had been able to continue. Alastair Cook, as if to demonstrate his one-day credentials, was out trying to reverse-sweep against the new ball, having just plonked the ball to the mid-wicket boundary in more conventional fashion. Ravi Bopara went hooking. But Matthew Walker and ten Doeschate got the innings back on course, as did Scott Styris. For Somerset the overseas pair, Pollard and Murali Kartik, were the best bowlers along with the ever reliable and inventive Alphonso Thomas. Compton, drafted into the side only because Craig Kieswetter has disappeared on England duty, played the innings that looked as if it would decide the match until the home side wobbled alarmingly in the final five overs. Opening the batting alongside Marcus Trescothick, Compton displayed slick timing and often extravagant footwork in an innings that will ensure more regular appearances in this form of the game. One moment he darted outside the off-stump to explore the onside, the next he was giving himself room; then back, then forward. Such eccentricities worked most of the time though his dismissal for 74 was bizarre. He was out hit wicket trying to reverse sweep. Whereupon Essex contrived a victory that may have surprised even themselves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
