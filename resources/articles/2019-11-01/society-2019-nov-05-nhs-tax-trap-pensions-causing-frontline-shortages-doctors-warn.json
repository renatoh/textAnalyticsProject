The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents Britain\u2019s 220,000 doctors, has written to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, calling on them to urgently address the pensions tax issue that is causing many of the UK\u2019s most senior doctors to reduce their overtime or leave the NHS altogether. The letter follows an audit of the Academy\u2019s members that asked them to give real-life examples of the impact the tax changes are having on patient care because fewer doctors means even longer delays for patients needing both urgent and elective care. With the NHS short of 11,000 doctors already, many hospitals rely on senior doctors working overtime to plug rota gaps and reduce waiting lists. In Nottingham, consultant radiologists at the city\u2019s NHS trust have halved from 1,200 to 600 the number of CT and MRI scans they read at home every month to help stop a backlog building up. This has forced Nottingham University Hospitals trust to outsource the work, which is costing them more money. Many other hospitals have also been forced to cut the number of operations they perform and outpatient clinics offered. Doctors are reducing the number of \u201cprogrammed activities\u201d, or four-hour sessions, they undertake to avoid being hit with bills for tens of thousands of pounds due to rises in the value of their pension linked to the amount of extra hours they take on. Rule changes introduced in 2016 meant rising numbers of consultants and other senior staff were facing unexpected tax bills linked to the value of their pensions. Some NHS staff were reported to have had to remortgage their homes to cover their tax bills, while others were faced with the choice of cutting their hours, opting out of the pension scheme or taking early retirement. At the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS trust three senior paediatricians have been forced to cut their hours to avoid punitive tax rates, which has meant 720 patient appointments have been lost this year. In a letter, the academy chair, Prof Carrie MacEwen, said: \u201cIt is evident from the findings that, due to severe medical staff shortages, the NHS has become entirely dependent on consultants delivering service provision over and above their existing contracts. This service is being put at risk because of the current pension taxation problem.\u201d NHS leaders fear the loss of so much labour by consultants will leave hospitals struggling to cope even more than usual with the service\u2019s winter crisis when it strikes. Failure to act will exacerbate the NHS\u2019s already serious shortage of doctors, which is estimated to involve vacancies for 11,000 medics across the UK, according to MacEwen. \u201cFurthermore, our findings indicate that pensions taxation is undermining staff morale, which is detrimental to the recruitment and retention of the medical workforce. Staff shortages in the NHS are a significant concern and we must ensure these pressures do not intensify further as a result of the pension arrangements,\u201d she said. Boris Johnson has pledged several times to solve the problem. However, medical groups including the British Medical Association, the doctors\u2019 trade union, have rejected proposals put forward by the department of health and social care as inadequate. In her letter, MacEwen warns Javid and Hancock that their solution, which involves giving doctors greater flexibility over how much goes into their pension every year, is \u201cinsufficient to tackle the long-term problems\u201d. She seeks action on a taper introduced in 2016 on the annual allowance doctors have on their pension pot growth, which the BMA and others claim is the main cause of the problem. \u201cIt simply isn\u2019t good enough that patients are paying the price because we have not yet found a national solution,\u201d said Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England. \u201cOperations are being cancelled as anaesthetists reduce their hours and wards are being closed because the senior staff needed are not there. The impact is longer waits for patients and putting other NHS staff under undue levels of pressure undermining staff morale and chipping away at efforts to address workforce shortages.\u201d \u2022 This article, its headline and its subheading were amended on 6 November 2019. An earlier version incorrectly said the closure of two ICUs at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS trust was due to staff shortages caused by the pensions tax issue.
