Here are the main developments from the last few hours: At least 4.3 million people are known to have been infected with the coronavirus worldwide, while at least 295,671 people have died. The figures collected by Johns Hopkins University are likely to be a great underestimate of the true scale of the pandemic. Trump describes Fauci\u2019s warning over reopening the economy too soon as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday described as not acceptable a warning given by top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci this week about the dangers of reopening the economy too quickly. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House, noting he was surprised by the response Fauci gave to lawmakers in testimony to the US Senate on Tuesday. Virus may never be eradicated \u2013 WHO. The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, the World Health Organization has said, warning against any attempt to predict how long it would keep circulating and calling for a \u201cmassive effort\u201d to counter it. Every African country is now affected by the outbreak, after Lesotho announced its first case. The virus was detected in one of 81 people tested after arriving last week from Saudi Arabia and neighbouring South Africa, Lesotho\u2019s health ministry said. Former UK spy chief dismisses Wuhan lab conspiracy theory. In the UK, the former director general of the domestic intelligence service has poured cold water on White House speculation that Covid-19 may have emerged via a leak from a coronavirus research laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Public Health England approves antibody test \u2013 report. Public Health England (PHE) has reportedly approved an antibody test kit, the first to receive such an endorsement. The kit is made by the Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG, the Daily Telegraph has reported. The newspaper added that it understands the UK\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care is in negotiations with Roche to buy millions of the kits. Afghanistan reached 5,000 confirmed cases, as the country\u2019s health ministry warned that easing lockdowns would bring a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. Out of 619 suspected patients tested in the last 24 hours, 259 came back positive, pushing the total number of infections to 5,226. The death toll reached 132, after five more patients died overnight. The number of recoveries is 648. Sweden announced it would hire up to 10,000 more care workersto address shortcomings in elderly care exposed by the pandemic. About half of the Sweden\u2019s 3,460 coronavirus-related deaths have been among nursing home residents, and another quarter among those receiving care at home. Mexico said it would reopen parts of economythe economy after 51 days of lockdown, despite the country reporting its highest number of daily deaths so far. Mexico has confirmed 1,992 new cases and 353 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 3,926 and the total number of cases to 38,324. Hotels and restaurants across Europe have been asked to enforce physical distancing between guests to allow Europeans to take their annual summer holiday. The EU executive called for a \u201cgradual and careful easing of lockdown restrictions across the continent\u201d. The car manufacturer Ford announced plans to restart production, including at two factories in the UK. Work will resume on 18 May at the company\u2019s engine plants in Dagenham in Essex and Bridgend in south Wales. The move, along with the reopening of the Valencia engine plant in Spain, will open all of Ford\u2019s European manufacturing facilities. Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now. I\u2019ll be blogging for the next few hours \u2013 get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. According to White House press pool reporters, the Donald Trump also called Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s message yesterday cautioning against opening the economy too soon \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cI was surprised by his answer,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools.\u201d Yesterday, the top public health official contradicted Trump, who urged schools and businesses to reopen and said the White House has set a target of having 100m vaccine doses by the autumn. Fauci disputed that timeline, indicating that neither a vaccine nor treatment could be developed and distributed in time to facilitate the reopening of schools in the fall. The president said: I think they should open the schools, absolutely. I think they should. It\u2019s had very little impact on young people. And I think that if you\u2019re an instructor, if you\u2019re a teacher, a professor over a certain age like let\u2019s say 65 or maybe even if you want to be conservative, 60, perhaps you want to stay out for a little while longer. But I think you should absolutely open the schools. Our country has got to get back and it\u2019s got to get back as soon as possible, and I don\u2019t consider our country coming back if the schools are closed. US authorities are accusing Chinese hackers of trying to steal Covid-19 vaccine research, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned: China\u2019s efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation\u2019s response to Covid-19. Neither offered evidence or examples to support the allegation. Washington has increasingly blamed Beijing for the outbreak caused by the virus that first emerged in China late last year. Asked on Monday about earlier reports that the US believed Chinese hackers were targeting US vaccine research, the president Donald Trump replied: What else is new with China? What else is new? Tell me. I\u2019m not happy with China. Beijing has repeatedly denied the US accusations. Of all the thousands of golfers and tennis players who were reacquainted with the reassuring swoosh and snap of club and racket on ball on Wednesday, few surely heard a sweeter sound than the 18-handicapper Ed Sandison. When the 34-year-old stepped on to the 176-yard first hole at the Styal Golf Club in Cheshire at 9.04am, he was merely happy to be back after eight weeks of lockdown, happier still when he made good contact with his ball, and stunned to the point of disbelief when he realised he had made his first ever hole-in-one. He told the Guardian: At first I couldn\u2019t find my ball anywhere so I was getting a little annoyed \u2013 until I checked the cup. I spent the next 17 holes laughing with my father-in-law Tony. But everyone I saw seemed to be in such a good mood \u2013 and no wonder with golf being back. Peru\u2019s rate of cases is peaking and will begin a slow decline, its president Mart\u00edn Vizcarra has said, as the country moves into a \u201cfinal stage\u201d of lockdown more than two months after its first case was detected. Peru, which has the second greatest number of cases in Latin America, will continue to enforce social distancing, particularly in markets, banks and public transportation, Vizcarra said. In this last stage of the state of emergency, we have to ratify all the good that we have done, which is enough, and to correct the defects. Cases in Peru rose to 76,306 on Wednesday, up by 4,247 from a day earlier. The death toll was 2,169, up by 112, according to data from the Ministry of Health. Only Brazil has a higher infection rate in Latin America, at 177,589 confirmed cases. The French drugmaker Sanofi SA is working with European regulators to speed up access to a potential vaccine in Europe after its chief executive suggested Americans would likely get the vaccine first. The company said it is in talks with the European Union and the French and German governments to speed up regional vaccine development. Sanofi, whose Pasteur division has an established track record of producing influenza vaccines, teamed up with British rival GlaxoSmithKline last month to come up with a candidate it hopes will be ready next year. They have received financial support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the US Health Department. As a result, doses produced in the United States are expected to go to US patients first; a prospect that has raised concern in Europe. Sanofi\u2019s chief executive Paul Hudson has told Bloomberg: The US government has the right to the largest preorder because it\u2019s invested in taking the risk. We are very encouraged to see the mobilisation of the [European commission] over the past weeks, exploring similar measures that could expedite both vaccines development and access to the European population. The company said that remainder of its vaccine manufacturing capacity will cover Europe and the rest of the world. Public Health England (PHE) has reportedly approved an antibody test kit, the first to receive such an endorsement. The kit is made by the Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG, the Daily Telegraph has reported. The accuracy of the test was given approval by experts at PHE\u2019s Porton Down facility last Thursday, the newspaper said. The newspaper added that it understands the UK\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care is in negotiations with Roche to buy millions of the kits. Brazilian media outlets have published the results of negative coronavirus tests taken by the country\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro following a Supreme Court ruling. The result backs up the president\u2019s previous claim of a clean bill of health, but doubts lingered over the results after it was revealed that the three tests also were carried out nearly two months ago \u2013 since when Bolsonaro has repeatedly flouted social distancing advice and mixed with crowds of supporters and ordinary Brazilians. The tests were performed on 12, 17 and 18 March, the O Globo newspaper reported. In the following weeks, Bolsonaro greeted demonstrators and ordinary Brazilians without a mask, posed for selfies, visited a supermarket and a bakery and even shook hands with an elderly woman after wiping his nose on his wrist. Last weekend he rode a jet-ski and stopped by a floating barbecue. Bolsonaro initially refused to release his tests results after 23 people who were on his trip to the United States in March tested positive. He has dismissed the rising Covid-19 death toll in Brazil with a casual \u201cso what?\u201d Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry reported a record 881 deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday night and the country has 177,589 confirmed cases. In March, Bolsonaro said his athletic background meant that, if he did catch Covid-19, he would barely feel it. Yet his government turned down a Freedom of Information request from the UOL news site, arguing the information was \u201csecret\u201d. The tests were made public on Wednesday by the Supreme Court judge Ricardo Lewandowski following a request from the Estado de S. Paulo newspaper. It won rulings in lower courts but was overruled by a High Court judge. Lewandoski overturned that decision. Italy\u2019s top flight football clubs have voted in a favour of resuming the season on 13 June during a general assembly, although the final decision rests with the government. Serie A has been suspended since 9 March and, although the government has authorised teams to hold collective training sessions from next Monday, it has not yet decided if and when the championship can resume. Serie A said: As far as the resumption of sports activities is concerned, the date of 13 June for the resumption of the championship has been indicated ... in accordance with medical protocols for the protection of players and all those involved. The young migrants and asylum seekers swim across the Rio Grande and clamber into the dense brush of Texas, across the US-Mexico border. Many are teens who left Central America on their own. Others were sent along by parents from refugee camps in Mexico. They are as young as 10. Under US law they would normally be allowed to live with relatives while their cases wind through immigration courts. Instead the Trump administration is quickly expelling them under an emergency declaration citing the coronavirus pandemic, with 600 minors expelled in April alone. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1,426 more deaths and 21,467 more confirmed infections, taking the totals to 82,246 and 1,364,061, respectively. Talks to ease restrictions in South African by the end of May and downgrade its alert level from four to three are set to begin, the country\u2019s president Cyril Ramaphosa has said. Ramaphosa added that parts of the country with the highest rates of infection would remain at alert level four and that changes to that level of restrictions would be announced in the coming days. In the UK, the former director general of the domestic intelligence service has poured cold water on White House speculation that Covid-19 may have emerged via a leak from a research laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Andrew Parker who was the director general of MI5 until two and half weeks ago, told a webinar: I\u2019m just not aware of any evidence that it is anything other than what people think it is: It came via markets. There are all sorts of hypotheses around, but I just think it is not useful to speculate, worry about all that. The former British spy chief said it was the business of intelligence agencies to find out if there was ever a point when a state or non-state actor was trying to deliberately spread a dangerous disease. In that case, he said, there \u201cshould be an expectation that the agencies will somehow uncover that\u201d. But, in remarks that could have been addressed directly to the US president Donald Trump or the secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Parker concluded: Conspiracy theories right now are not helpful. Both Trump and Pompeo have publicly pushed the lab leak theory without offering supporting evidence. British intelligence agencies have been saying for the past couple of weeks they don\u2019t subscribe to the lab leak theory, although the idea is nevertheless being pushed in news media in the UK, US and Australia. Parker was speaking at a webinar organised by the Royal Society of Medicine. Chile\u2019s government has announced plans for the strictest lockdown measures seen in the country yet, with compulsory quarantine for the entire zone of greater Santiago \u2013 an area with a population of 6.5m people. \u201cThe battle of Santiago is crucial in the war against coronavirus,\u201d said Health Minister Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, announcing the measures. The move comes as a record 2,660 cases were confirmed in 24 hours; a 60% increase on the previous day\u2019s figure that brought the total number of cases to 34,381. That is the third highest in South America. In total, 346 people in Chile have died. The surge in numbers has piled fresh pressure on health officials who have enacted a \u201csuppress and lift\u201d strategy, limiting lockdowns to affected areas. Health workers have been calling for a total lockdown in Santiago since March but the Health Ministry has argued the strategy was keeping cases under control, while preventing the economic fallout of a total closure of the city. While new cases outside of Santiago have been falling, the localised lockdown measures have proved unsuccessful in curbing the spread in the capital, where 85% of new cases are concentrated. Political opponents trace the surge back to the government\u2019s steps to return to normal under a month ago. \u201cPremature messages from the government confused people who are now paying the price\u201d tweeted Carolina Goic, the president of the Christian Democratic Party. Sebastian Pi\u00f1era has pleaded the public to respect the new quarantine measures, which will come into effect Friday night from 22pm. \u201cWe need your collaboration,\u201d he tweeted. At least 95,000 people have entered the UK from overseas since the country\u2019s lockdown was imposed, one of the government\u2019s chief scientific advisers has revealed, while repeatedly failing to provide an estimate of how many of these people had Covid-19. Appearing before MPs on the science and technology committee, Prof John Aston, the chief scientific adviser at the Home Office, admitted that had tougher restrictions been introduced at the border, the peak of the virus may have been delayed \u2013 but he did not say by how long, or if this would have saved lives. A nationwide study of more than 60,000 people in Spain suggests about 5% of the population \u2013 approximately 2 million people \u2013 have had the virus. According to the provisional results of tests designed by the health ministry and the Carlos III public health institute, 5% of those tested had produced antibodies. While the prevalence of the antibodies was similar in men and women, it was lower in children and babies. There were also significant regional variations: while Murcia, Melilla, Asturias and the Canary islands showed an infection rate of less than 2%, the proportion rose to more than 10% in the regions of Madrid and Castilla-La Mancha. As the health minister Salvador Illa made plain on Wednesday evening, the study shows herd immunity has not been achieved. The WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, added: The trajectory is in our hands, and it\u2019s everybody\u2019s business, and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic. Ryan said \u201cvery significant control\u201d of the virus was required in order to lower the assessment of risk, which he said remained high at the \u201cnational, regional and global levels\u201d. As countries around the world seek a way to ease lockdown measures, public health experts say extreme caution is needed to avoid new outbreaks. Ryan said opening land borders was less risky than easing air travel, which was a \u201cdifferent challenge\u201d. \u201cWe need to get into the mindset that it is going to take some time to come out of this pandemic,\u201d the WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said. The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, the World Health Organization has said, warning against any attempt to predict how long it would keep circulating and calling for a \u201cmassive effort\u201d to counter it. The organisation\u2019s emergencies expert, Mike Ryan, said: It is important to put this on the table: This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away. I think it is important we are realistic and I don\u2019t think anyone can predict when this disease will disappear. I think there are no promises in this and there are no dates. This disease may settle into a long problem, or it may not be. However, he said the world had some control over how it copes with the disease, although this would take a \u201cmassive effort\u201d even if a vaccine was found \u2013 a prospect he described as a \u201cmassive moonshot\u201d. More than 100 potential vaccines are being developed, including several in clinical trials, but experts have underscored the difficulties of finding vaccines that are effective against coronaviruses. Ryan noted that vaccines exist for other illnesses, such as measles, that have not been eliminated. France\u2019s cumulative death toll has risen by 83 to 27,074, with the rate of increase slowing after accelerating the three previous days, local authorities have said. The number of hospitalised people fell again to 21,071 from 21,595 on Tuesday, continuing an uninterrupted downward trend now entering its fifth week, according to the health ministry. On the third day after the end of a 55-day lockdown, the number of people in intensive care also continued a similar downtrend and fell by 114 or 4.7% to 2,428. Confirmed cases were up 0.4% at 140,374. Here are the latest lines in our global coronavirus coverage: At least 4.3 million people are known to have been infected with the coronavirus worldwide, while at least 293,514 people have died. The figures collected by Johns Hopkins University are likely to be a great underestimate of the true scale of the pandemic. Every African country is now affected by the outbreak, after Lesotho announced its first case. The virus was detected in one of 81 people tested after arriving last week from Saudi Arabia and neighbouring South Africa, Lesotho\u2019s health ministry said. Afghanistan reached 5,000 confirmed cases, as the country\u2019s health ministry warned that easing lockdowns would bring a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. Out of 619 suspected patients tested in the last 24 hours, 259 came back positive, pushing the total number of infections to 5,226. The death toll reached 132, after five more patients died overnight. The number of recoveries is 648. Sweden announced it would hire up to 10,000 more care workers to address shortcomings in elderly care exposed by the pandemic. About half of Sweden\u2019s 3,460 coronavirus-related deaths have been among nursing home residents, and another quarter among those receiving care at home. Mexico said it would reopen parts of the economy after 51 days of lockdown, despite the country reporting its highest number of daily deaths so far. Mexico has confirmed 1,992 new cases and 353 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 3,926 and the total number of cases to 38,324. Hotels and restaurants across Europe have been asked to enforce physical distancing between guests to allow Europeans to take their annual summer holiday. The EU executive called for a \u201cgradual and careful easing of lockdown restrictions across the continent\u201d. The car manufacturer Ford announced plans to restart production, including at two factories in the UK. Work will resume on 18 May at the company\u2019s engine plants in Dagenham in Essex and Bridgend in south Wales. The move, along with the reopening of the Valencia engine plant in Spain, will open all of Ford\u2019s European manufacturing facilities. A zoo in Canada is to send two giant pandas back to China after disruptions to international travel meant it was unable to import enough bamboo to feed them, Reuters reports. The pandas, Er Shun and Da Mao, arrived in Canada in 2014 as part of a 10-year agreement between Canada and China. After spending five years at Toronto zoo, the two adult giant pandas arrived at Calgary zoo in March 2018 with cubs Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue. Calgary zoo officials now fear a second wave of Covid-19 could cut off the pandas\u2019 food supply entirely. Giant pandas consume 40kg of bamboo a day and it makes up 99% of their diet, the zoo said. The zoo\u2019s president and CEO, Cl\u00e9ment Lanthier, said in a statement: We believe the best and safest place for Er Shun and Da Mao to be during these challenging and unprecedented times is where bamboo is abundant and easy to access. On Wednesday, Canada reported 329 new cases of coronavirus and 40 new deaths. So far 71,486 people in the country have tested positive for the virus, of whom 5,209 have died and 34,496 recovered. Australia\u2019s e-safety commissioner has warned that child abusers have created and shared an online grooming manual describing ways to manipulate and exploit the increased number of children at home and online during Covid-19, writes Melissa Davey, the Guardian\u2019s Melbourne bureau chief. Covid-19 restrictions have coincided with a significant increase in reports to the eSafety Office about child sexual abuse material, Julie Inman Grant told Guardian Australia. She said investigators had seen a jump in searches by predators on the dark web seeking information on how to abuse children. \u201cI think of it like bees in a hive, gathering around the honey,\u201d Inman Grant said. \u201cAbusers see Covid-19 as a honeypot for them, with at-risk boys and girls spending much more time at home and online, often without supervision, and often while feeling isolated and lonely.\u201d The Covid-19 predator handbook contained details about how to coerce children online to share sexual images and videos of themselves, she said. \u201cThe handbook advises predators to get their kicks online rather than trying to meet children face-to-face because of restrictions and heightened vigilance of law enforcement on the streets,\u201d Inman Grant said. Yemen\u2019s Saudi-backed government reported the first coronavirus case in Marib province and four other infections elsewhere, taking the tally of cases in areas under its control to 70, including 12 deaths, according to Reuters. Parks in Turkey filled with the sound of children on Wednesday as authorities allowed those aged 14 and under to leave their homes for the first time in 40 days, the Associated Press reports. The country\u2019s children were allowed to venture out for four hours between 11am and 3pm as Turkey eased some restrictions in place to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Youngsters between the ages of 15 and 20 will be able to leave homes for a few hours on Friday, while older people were briefly allowed out for the first time in seven weeks on 10 May. In the city\u2019s Birlik Mahallesi neighbourhood, two children were seen riding their scooters up and down a street while a voice from a loudspeaker on the top of the minaret of a nearby mosque called on the public not to be \u201cfooled by the arrival of spring and good weather\u201d. \u201cThe danger of infection is not over yet,\u201d the announcement said. Health officials reported 58 more deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, as 1,639 further people tested positive for the coronavirus that causes it. It brings the total number of cases in Turkey to 143,114, of whom 3,952 have died. Infections peaked last month, with 5,138 reported on 11 April, and since then have declined steadily. Shopping centres, hairdressers, barber shops and hair salons were allowed to reopen on Monday, as part of a \u201cnormalisation plan\u201d set out by the government. Nightly curfew hours in Tunisia are to be relaxed after the country recorded three consecutive days without detecting any new coronavirus infections, according to Reuters. The north African democracy imposed the curfew in March, aiming to slow the spread of the virus by keeping people at home, combined with a lockdown that shuttered all but key shops and services. The president, Kais Saied, has cut the curfew hours to 11pm to 5am, instead of 8pm to 6am, the state news agency TAP reported, 10 days after the start of a gradual reopening of the bureaucracy and economy. It follows the government\u2019s announcement that no new coronavirus cases have been recorded for three days in a row. So far it has reported 1,032 confirmed cases in total and 45 deaths. Senior health and hospital officials in different parts of the country told Reuters there were very few coronavirus patients still in care, indicating the reduction in the number of new cases is not down to a lack of testing. Chile is to implement a general quarantine across Santiago, the national capital, and a nationwide quarantine for all people over 75, after a surge in coronavirus infections, Reuters reports. The \u201cextraordinary, tough new measures\u201d were announced by the health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, on Wednesday, after 2,660 new cases of the virus were recorded in the country overnight, up 60% from the previous day. \u201cThe month of May is proving very tough on our country,\u201d said Ma\u00f1alich, who added that the quarantine, which takes effect on Friday, was necessary to bring down the contagion rate. Chile has 34,381 total confirmed cases and 14,865 recovered victims of the virus. Eleven new deaths have brought the total toll from Covid-19 in the country to 346. Ma\u00f1alich called on citizens to pull together and take the measures seriously, and report anyone not wearing masks or observing physical distancing. \u201cIn reality the battle for Santiago is the crucial battle in the war against coronavirus,\u201d said Ma\u00f1alich. Some 313,750 PCR tests have been carried out on the population of 18 million people. Asked about claims that some public hospitals were close to collapse, he insisted that patients and medical resources had already been transferred to avoid overwhelming particular areas. Global trade is forecast to fall by a record 27% in the second quarter of the year following a slump in the export of cars, machine parts and oil, reports Guardian economics writer Philip Inman. The coronavirus pandemic has hit the supply and demand for products across the world leading to a severe decline in world trade, said Unctad, the United Nations organisation that tracks trade flows. Almost every category of goods is expected to suffer a fall in trade over the coming months, adding to a 3% decline in the first quarter of the year. Unctad said the data revealed the huge shock to the global economy from the Covid-19 pandemic. Cuba is betting a biotech sector begun by the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro can give it an edge in a global race to find effective treatments for the new coronavirus, Reuters reports. It is especially touting an interferon it produces, a decades old antiviral agent that boosts the immune system. The island nation says the drug has been successful in treating Covid-19 at home and in China, and that 80 countries have already expressed an interest in buying its interferon alpha 2b. The government is hoping its interferon and other treatments it is developing will provide a lift to its struggling economy, which is subject to a six-decade-old US trade embargo. \u201cWe have good products like interferon alpha 2b that we are exporting and that open possibilities,\u201d the trade minister, Rodrigo Malmierca, said during a recent televised roundtable. Interferons have long been used internationally to treat dengue fever, cancer and hepatitis B and C. Studies during the Sars epidemic in 2003 suggested interferons might also be useful against coronaviruses. Interferons can cause serious side effects when administered in their usual forms \u2013 injections or infusions \u2013 some of which may mirror Covid-19 symptoms, such as fever and breathing difficulty. Cuba, however, says it has treated nearly all of its patients with interferon injections and credits the medicine for helping it achieve a lower mortality rate among its 1,804 confirmed Covid-19 cases \u2013 4.1% versus an average of 5.9% for the rest of the Americas. On Wednesday, Cuba reported six new cases of coronavirus and one death. The UK has reported 494 more deaths from coronavirus, bringing the total in the world\u2019s second worst-affected country to 33,186. Montreal, a city touted by tourist guides as \u201cnorth America\u2019s Europe\u201d for its rich culture and joie de vivre, is Canada\u2019s centre for Covid-19. Of the entire country\u2019s 70,000 cases and 5,000 deaths, the city of 2 million people has 20,000 cases and more than 2,000 deaths, or about 64% of the entire Quebec province\u2019s death toll. Those numbers have catapulted Quebec into an unfavourable position: it is now the seventh deadliest place in the world for daily coronavirus deaths, according to Quebec newspaper La Presse. If Peter McCabe\u2019s recent Empty Montreal photo project is any evidence, the city has largely obeyed stay-home orders. His streetscapes devoid of human activity show a side of Montreal almost no one sees. \u201cThe air is crystal clear. That\u2019s not normal,\u201d he said. But if people are genuinely staying home, the elevated infection rate isn\u2019t normal either. Why are so many people getting sick and dying here? Tracey Lindeman, a journalist based in the city, has looked for answers. The European parliament will discuss Hungary\u2019s controversial coronavirus laws on Thursday, the latest showdown between Brussels and Budapest over rule of law under Hungary\u2019s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, write Shaun Walker in Budapest and Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. In late March Hungary\u2019s parliament gave Orb\u00e1n the right to rule by decree indefinitely as part of a package of measures aimed at fighting coronavirus. The law was criticised for failing to include a sunset clause to give a clear time limit to the state of emergency and for introducing potential jail sentences for people who spread false information, which in recent days has led to raids on individuals criticising the government on Facebook. The one-hour debate in Brussels will have no formal consequences but is likely to deepen antagonism between the Orb\u00e1n government and the European parliament, which in September 2018 triggered a sanctions procedure against Hungary. We now have more details on the situation in Lesotho, which reported its first case of coronavirus earlier on Wednesday. The government has said there is a likelihood that more cases could be recorded before the end of the week after the health ministry said it was awaiting results for 301 cases where tests had been done and sent to neighbouring South Africa, writes Silence Charumbira in Maseru, the country\u2019s capital, for the Guardian\u2019s foreign desk. The tiny southern African mountain kingdom had until Tuesday enjoyed the tag of being the only country on the continent to be free of Covid-19. But the enviable distinction evaporated with the government saying one suspected case had come back positive from 81 samples sent for testing in South Africa on Saturday. The tests were for people returning from South Africa and parts of the Middle East. A spokesperson said on Wednesday: On 9 May 2020, the ministry [of health] conducted 81 tests for Covid-19 from travellers from South Africa and Saudi Arabia. On 11 May 2020 the samples were shipped to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa and results were obtained on 12 May 2020. Eighty people tested negative for Covid-19 while one tested positive. There were 195 new coronavirus deaths in Italy on Wednesday, 23 more than on Tuesday, bringing the death toll to 31,106, reports Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. New infections rose by 888, down by 514 since Tuesday. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte\u2019s cabinet is expected to soon approve a \u20ac55bn (\u00a348bn) package to revive Italy\u2019s economy. The much-anticipated package will go towards helping small businesses, families that have been struggling under the lockdown, furloughed workers, the self-employed, the health sector and culture and tourism. The government has also reached an agreement on legalising migrant agricultural workers and carers, according to the news agency Ansa. Ursula von der Leyen has conceded that companies in rich countries such as Germany have been given an unfair advantage following the relaxation of the EU\u2019s state aid rules, writes Daniel Boffey, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief. In a speech to the European parliament in Brussels, the European commission president suggested the single market was in danger of breaking up as wealthier member states spent their way out of the crisis. She said: Every member state has supported workers and companies as best as possible \u2013 in large part thanks to the European level being fast and forceful: we triggered the general escape clause and we gave full flexibility on EU fund and state aid rules. But it\u2019s also true that each member state has a different fiscal space \u2013 so the use of state aid is very different. What we start to observe now is an unlevelling of the playing field in our single market. Therefore, in response, we need to support those that need it the most, we have to push for investment and reform. Brussels suspended the EU-wide state aid restrictions on subsidies to companies in mid-March. Germany accounts for more than half of the state aid approved by the European commission since the pandemic began. Hotels, restaurants and beaches across Europe are being asked to enforce physical distancing between guests to allow Europeans to take their annual summer holiday, reports Jennifer Rankin, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent. Announcing a set of measures intended to rescue Europe\u2019s crisis-hit tourism industry, the European Union executive called on Wednesday for a \u201cgradual\u201d and \u201ccareful\u201d easing of lockdown restrictions across the continent, while issuing advice to hotels, resort managers, restaurant owners and travel companies. Hotels are being asked to consider enabling guests to book slots at the pool, in the gym or the restaurant. Large public spaces, such as buffets, should ensure guests not in the same family can remain at least 1.5 metres apart, while big events, such as concerts, are discouraged. During their stay, guests should also be advised on \u201crespiratory etiquette\u201d, namely sneezing or coughing into a tissue or a bent elbow, and issued with frequent reminders to wash their hands. Hotels would also be expected to keep address records to ensure contact tracing if there is an outbreak of coronavirus. Buses, trains and ferries are encouraged to run with fewer people and sell tickets online. Passengers are being asked to wear face masks on all modes of transport, in airports and stations, while duty free shops should restrict customer numbers. Transport workers are asked to wear masks and gloves, while operators should limit the numbers of people in waiting areas. \u201cThis is not going to be a normal summer, not for any of us,\u201d said the European commission vice-president, Margrethe Vestager. She urged governments and businesses to follow recommendations from Brussels, so \u201cwe don\u2019t have to face a summer stuck at home or a completely lost summer for the European tourist industry\u201d. Doctors in Vietnam have decided to carry out a lung transplant on a 43-year-old British man who is the country\u2019s most critically ill Covid-19 patient, VN Express reports. Computed tomography scans have shown that the patient, a pilot for Vietnam Airlines, has just 10% lung function after fibrosis solidified both lungs. He has been on life support for 38 days. Nguyen Van Vinh Chau, director of the hospital for tropical diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, said the decision to give the man a lung transplant was confirmed on Tuesday, at a meeting of medical experts led by Vietnam\u2019s ministry of health. The ministry has been seeking a donor. After an aggressive and proactive response to the coronavirus outbreak, Vietnam recorded just 288 confirmed cases of the disease, of whom 252 have recovered. So far it has reported no deaths from Covid-19. Patient 91, as the British patient has been designated, fell ill on 18 March. Doctors said he suffers from a blood-clotting disorder and that as his condition worsened he also suffered a cytokine storm syndrome, where the immune system overreacts to the infection. Hi, this is Caroline Davies handing the blog back to my colleague Damien Gayle . Italy\u2019s government on Monday introduced a decree that will send back to prison dozens of Mafia bosses released due to the risk of Covid infection, writes Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo. Since the beginning of the outbreak, Italian judges set free hundreds of ageing mobsters suffering from specific illnesses because they are \u201cat risk of complications in case of Covid-19 infection\u201d and moved them to house arrests. Prosecutors, anti-mafia associations and parties have protested against the judges\u2019 decisions, fearing mafia bosses could leverage the coronavirus crisis to secure their release. Italian opposition parties last week filed a motion of no-confidence in Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede. Although Bonafede clarified last week that the decision to release Mafiosi was not taken by the government and called for a new norm to revise rules on releasing mafia bosses to house arrest, centre-right opposition filed a motion of no-confidence. Bonafede, who is a member of the 5-Star Movement (M5S) told wire agency Ansa that the centre right\u2019s move would mean \u201cundermining confidence in the fight against corruption, the fight against the mafias, reforms to make trials shorter and more efficient, and measures to make sure no one goes unpunished\u201d. Therefore, on Monday, Italy introduced a new decree that will send back to jail the mobsters released during the pandemic and on Wednesday the first Mafia boss, a member of the Sicilian Mafia, was moved back to prison. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Italian police arrested 91 suspected members of the Sicilian Mafia that were trying to exploit economic woes triggered by the Covid pandemic. Charges range from mafia association to extortion, fraudulent assets possession, receiving stolen goods, money laundering, drug trafficking, sporting fraud and fraud and arrests were made in Palermo and Milan. According to Sicilian investigators, who launched the operation, mobsters were laundering extortion and drug trafficking revenue. The magistrates said bosses were preparing to use ill-gained cash to buy struggling businesses that shut down during the lockdown. Hotels, restaurants and beaches across Europe are being asked to enforce social-distancing between guests to allow Europeans to take their annual summer holiday. Announcing a set of measures intended to rescue Europe\u2019s crisis-hit tourism industry, the European Union executive called on Wednesday for a \u201cgradual\u201d and \u201ccareful\u201d easing of lockdown restrictions across the continent, while issuing advice to hotels, resort managers, restaurant owners and travel companies.

She urged governments and businesses to follow recommendations from Brussels, so \u201cwe don\u2019t have to face a summer stuck at home or a completely lost summer for the European tourist industry\u201d. The commission is calling for a phased lifting of border closures, meaning countries with similarly low levels of coronavirus open to each other\u2019s tourists. Austria has already announced its intention to welcome visitors from Germany and the Czech Republic, while the three Baltic states will open their frontiers to each other\u2019s citizens from 15 May. The commission is urging neighbouring countries to coordinate decisions to ease the lockdown, in contrast to the haphazard and sudden border closures when the crisis began. \u201cOur guidance doesn\u2019t try to prescribe exactly what governments and business should do, instead it\u2019s about coordinating the steps that are taken throughout Europe,\u201d Vestager said. As countries look to ease school and play restrictions, Hannah Devlin, the Guardian\u2019s science correspondent, looks at the evidence that children react differently to coronavirus. You can read her report here . Thousands of sub-Saharan migrants in Morocco are trapped by coronavirus and poverty, AFP reports. Deprived of work and access to aid, they are struggling to make ends meet under COVID-19 restrictions. \u201cThe misery is across the board,\u201d , AFP quoted Ousmane Ba, head of the Collective of sub-Saharan Communities in Morocco. \u201cThose who worked as vendors are under lockdown without financial resources and the situation is getting worse for illegal migrants living in camps. \u201cThey can\u2019t go anywhere and non-government organisations can\u2019t come to help them.\u201d The north African kingdom has long been a transit country for migrants and refugees seeking a better life in Europe, and it has also become a host country for many. At least 20,000, the vast majority from sub-Saharan Africa, are trapped \u201cin a humanitarian emergency\u201d, said sociologist Mehdi Alioua of the anti-racism foreigners\u2019 support group GADEM, AFP reports. Many of them work in the informal sector, which accounts for more than 20 percent of Morocco\u2019s economy, and tend to live precariously, hand to mouth, even in normal times. Hi. This is Caroline Davies taking over the live blog from Damien Gayle for a while. You can contact me on caroline.davies@theguardian.com if you have any tips or suggestions. The forced repatriation of migrants should be suspended for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic to protect the health of migrants and their communities, and guarantee human rights, a coalition of supranational agencies and NGOs has said. In a statement released on Wednesday, the UN network on migration said it was concerned about reports of states using the forced return of migrants as a measure to respond to the pandemic. In the statement, hosted on the International Organization for Migration website, the network added: Forced returns can intensify serious public health risks for everyone \u2013 migrants, public officials, health workers, social workers and both host and origin communities. Forced returns place additional strain on countries of return. Many health systems are already stretched and lack capacity to protect returnees and their communities, including through testing upon arrival and quarantine and self-isolation measures that preserve family unity and ensure the best interests of children. Returnees may face additional risks during transfer and upon return, such as lack of access to adequate healthcare, poor water and sanitation systems, halted ground transportation, additional restrictions on movement and violent discrimination and stigma in communities of return. In some contexts, returned migrants and asylum seekers may also be at risk of experiencing protracted displacement, trafficking in persons, and extreme financial hardship with increases to already high levels of unemployment due to Covid-19. Hairdressers, restaurants and cafes will reopen in Poland next week, the government announced on Wednesday \u2013 despite a recent increase in infections. The prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said that wearing masks outdoors and social distancing would still be mandatory when the new measures, which also include a return to school for some children, take effect on 18 May, according to AFP. The country of 38 million people, where testing for coronavirus has been limited, recorded a spike in infections this week after a wave of lockdown measures were suspended 10 days ago. On Tuesday, the health ministry reported 595 more people had tested positive for coronavirus, the highest daily number so far, and announced 28 more deaths from Covid-19. However, by Wednesday numbers swung back down, with 148 new cases reported, the lowest number in about six weeks, and eight new deaths. Poland has so far recorded 17,062 cases of coronavirus, with 6,410 patients recovering and 847 deaths. Hotels, shopping centres and childcare facilities reopened last week but a 10 May presidential election was postponed after preparations for a postal ballot became mired in chaos. Police in Montenegro detained a bishop of the Serbian Orthodox church and seven priests on suspicion of violating lockdown measures by organising a procession, AFP reports. The coastal Balkan state of 620,000 people has had 324 recorded coronavirus infections, of whom nine have died and 298 have recovered. Lockdown measures were eased this week, allowing churches to hold mass again, providing worshippers adhere to social distancing rules, including staying 10 sq metres apart and wearing face masks. But all other large public gatherings are still not permitted. Bishop Joanikije and the seven priests were remanded in custody for 72 hours after several thousand people took part in the procession held on Tuesday evening in the north-western town of Niksic. They are accused of \u201cfailing to comply with health regulations to combat a dangerous infectious disease\u201d, a prosecutors\u2019 statement said. The eight \u201cviolated the ban on public gatherings and organised a religious service in the streets of Niksic, attended by a large number of citizens\u201d, the statement added. If found guilty they face up to 12 years in jail. Schools, museums and hairdressers in Belgium will be allowed to reopen under strict conditions from next week, as part of a wide-ranging easing of the national lockdown, reports Jennifer Rankin, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent. Following a meeting of Belgium\u2019s national security council on Wednesday, the government announced a move to phase two of the lockdown-lifting plan from 18 May. From that day primary and secondary schools will reopen to selected years, but with extra hygiene measures in place. Marriages and funerals can take place with no more than 30 guests and social distancing in place. Markets can start trading again, with a maximum of 50 traders, who must wear masks. Hairdressers and beauticians can open to customers with appointments, but staff and customers will have to wear face coverings. Museums and zoos can open to the public, as long as they sell tickets online and take steps to keep people distanced, while any onsite cafes and restaurants must remain closed. Since the start of the week, non-essential shops have been allowed to reopen, while limited socialising has been permitted, as part of the first tentative steps to ending the lockdown. Authorities have warned these measures could be reversed if the pandemic worsens. The number of infections has been on a slow downward trend since the end of March. In the last 24 hours Belgium has recorded 70 new hospital admissions, compared with 400-500 a day at the peak of the crisis. The prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, has said \u201cthere will probably be no return to normal for the summer\u201d. Large cultural and sporting events remain banned. Any reopening of bars and restaurants will not happen before 8 June, when the next phase of steps to end the lockdown could come into force. After 51 days of lockdowns, Mexico is preparing for \u201cthe new normality\u201d, its president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, said on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press \u2013 despite reporting its highest number of new deaths so far. On Wednesday the country reported 1,992 new cases of coronavirus and 353 new deaths from Covid-19, the highest daily figures since its outbreak began. The figures bring the total death toll to 3,926, while the total number of cases stands at 38,324, of whom 25,935 have recovered. However, AP reported, officials have acknowledged the real figure is many times higher. Mexico has been under pressure from US officials to reopen auto plants because without them, integrated supply chains would make it hard for plants in the US and Canada to reopen. At the country\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing, the economy secretary, Graciela M\u00e1rquez, included car and truck manufacturing among the first industries that would be allowed to resume, following a \u201cgradual, orderly and cautious\u201d reopening. M\u00e1rquez said that about one-tenth of Mexico\u2019s townships that have no recorded cases of coronavirus would be allowed to resume business and school activities, but would be surrounded by health checkpoints. There are about 269 such \u201ctownships of hope\u201d, that neither have active cases in their own territory nor in adjoining townships. They are largely located in rural areas in north-central and south-eastern Mexico. The health secretary, Jorge Alcocer, said: \u201cWe are in the critical part of the pandemic, but we are doing well.\u201d The education secretary, Esteban Moctezuma, said: \u201cWe are not going to return to classes until it is safe.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s US live blog has now started, with news of a gulf opening between the country\u2019s public health body, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the White House on how to safely reopen the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. My colleagues across the Atlantic report that advice from the nation\u2019s top disease control experts included detailed instructive guidance and more restrictive measures than the plan released by the White House last month. The guidance, which was shelved by Trump administration officials, also offered recommendations to help communities decide when to shut facilities down again during future flareups of Covid-19.

The Japan Sumo Association (JSA) confirmed the death and identified the wrestler as Shobushi, whose real name was Kiyotaka Suetake. The association said he died of multiple organ failure. He is reported to have been the first sumo wrestler to die from the virus, and the first person in his 20s to die in Japan from Covid-19. The JSA said the wrestler developed a fever on 4 April but could not get a test or find a hospital until his symptoms worsened and he was accepted four days later. He was moved to an intensive care unit on 19 April. The JSA said he suffered from diabetes. The JSA chairman, Hakkaku, said: I can only imagine how hard it must have been, battling illness for over a month, but like a wrestler he endured it bravely and fought the disease until the end. I just want him to rest peacefully now. The Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, guardians of the French language, have said a major non to le Covid. Not the actual disease, but the use of the masculine definitive article \u201cle\u201d, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. While many in France have been referring to \u201cle Covid\u201d, the so-called \u201cImmortals\u201d who make up the academy have ruled otherwise. Covid, they insist, is most definitely feminine. \u201cCovid is the acronym for coronavirus disease and acronyms have the genus of the name that forms the core of the phrase of which they are an abbreviation,\u201d the academy ruled in a statement on its website under the heading \u201cSay, don\u2019t say\u201d, aimed at stopping the French language being infected with Anglicisms. For example, it continued, the national rail company SNCF (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer) is \u201cla\u201d because the nucleus of this group is \u201csociety\u201d, which is feminine in French. However, the IOC (International Olympic Committee) is \u201cle\u201d because the nucleus \u201ccommittee\u201d is masculine. It said: When this syntagm is composed of foreign words, the same principle applies. We can distinguish the FBI, Federal Bureau of Investigation, from the CIA, Central Intelligence Agency, since in one case the core word is translated by a masculine noun, bureau, and in the other by a feminine noun, agency. The Philippines\u2019 health ministry on Wednesday recorded 21 more coronavirus deaths and 268 additional infections. In a bulletin, the ministry said total deaths from the novel coronavirus have reached 772 while confirmed cases have risen to 11,618. But 145 more patients have recovered, increasing total recoveries to 2,251. The latest figures came as the government ordered an investigation into a birthday party thrown by the chief of police in Manila, after photos posted online showed him and dozens of fellow officers flouting the country\u2019s ban on socialising, Reuters reports. Photographs posted on the force\u2019s Facebook page on 8 May showed Debold Sinas, the chief of the national capital region\u2019s police office, along with dozens of people sitting closely together without masks, with beer cans on their tables despite a liquor ban, while a band entertained them. The photographs were taken down as the backlash mounted on social media, but by Wednesday the police chief\u2019s party had become the Philippines\u2019 second most trending topic on Twitter with more than 22,000 tweets. Sinas apologised for \u201ccausing anxiety to the public\u201d, but the national police chief and justice minister ordered separate investigations into the incident. \u201cIt was never my intention to disobey existing protocols relative to the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine,\u201d Sinas said in a statement. Sweden\u2019s public health authority reported 147 more deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, as the government announced it would hire up to 10,000 more nursing assistants and care workers to address shortcomings in elderly care exposed by the pandemic. About half of the 3,460 coronavirus-related deaths reported in Sweden have been among nursing home residents, and another quarter among those receiving care at home. The country\u2019s approach to the outbreak has been controversial, after the government eschewed a wide-ranging lockdown of society in favour of keeping the economy open. So far the country\u2019s public health authority has reported 27,909 confirmed cases, more than a third of which have been in the capital Stockholm, which has also accounted for about half of deaths. (A good daily analysis of Sweden\u2019s coronavirus statistics is available on the SVT Nyheter website) The boost in staff is the result of a deal between the government, Sweden\u2019s largest labour union Kommunal, and the country\u2019s municipalities which are tasked with managing elderly care, according to AFP. \u201cThe virus outbreak has shown that elderly care is vulnerable, and that has structural explanations,\u201d the health minister, Lena Hallengren, told reporters. The failure to protect vulnerable nursing home residents has been widely debated in the Nordic country. Some critics have blamed staff working conditions, with reports that many had to work without protective gear. In March, Kommunal said that 40% of staff at nursing homes in Stockholm \u2013 the centre of the Swedish epidemic \u2013 were unskilled workers employed on short-term contracts, with hourly wages and no job security, while 23% were temps. These were people who often could not afford not to go to work even if they were sick, they argued. Fifty-two more patients have died from Covid-19 in the Netherlands, with 227 more people testing positive for the coronavirus, health authorities said on Wednesday. The latest update from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) brings the total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus to 43,211, and the death toll to 5,562. As of Wednesday morning, more than 69,000 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed across Africa, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office. Of those infected, more than 23,000 have recovered and about 2,300 have died. The last country in Africa left unaffected by the coronavirus pandemic, Lesotho, has announced its first case, AFP reports. The virus was detected in one of 81 people who were tested after arriving last week from Saudi Arabia and neighbouring South Africa, the health ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Health informs the Basotho nation and the entire community living in Lesotho, that the country now has the first confirmed case of Covid-19,\u201d said the director general, Dr Nyane Letsie. The patient is a Lesotho national studying in Saudi Arabia. Lesotho went into lockdown on 29 March to protect itself from a potential spread of the virus from South Africa, which entirely surrounds the kingdom and has the highest number of confirmed cases on the continent. Prime Minister Thomas Thabane loosened the restrictions on 6 May, allowing \u201call non-essential services and enterprises\u201d to \u201ctemporarily open shop\u201d. From this Saturday Germany will relax controls on all of its borders, most of which have been completely closed since the middle of March to all but regular commuters and essential travel in an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus, writes Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent. The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said that regulations were still being worked out with some countries, but in essence, borders with France, Austria and Switzerland will effectively be reopened, with all but random checks on both vehicles and their passengers taking place. The border with Luxembourg will be free from any controls, and a similar solution is being negotiated with authorities in Denmark, he said. Border police reacted to the news by opening five border crossing points between the southern German state of Bavaria, and Austria, on Wednesday morning. Earlier, the Austrian government had announced it was opening its borders with Germany, following a telephone meeting between the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and her Austrian counterpart, Sebastian Kurz, on Tuesday. The overall aim, said Seehofer, was to return to \u201cunrestricted tourism\u201d by 15 June. The news offers fresh perspectives both for businesses, especially in agriculture and forestry, and holidaymakers, for whom a summer holiday beyond Germany had seemed all but a faint possibility but is now looking like a much more realistic prospect. Seehofer said the restrictions could be easily tightened again if the virus was seen to be out of control. \u201cThis is on condition that the virus\u2019s progress continues to develop in a manageable way,\u201d Seehofer said. \u201cIf the situation worsens, we would have to react to that.\u201d Travel to Germany from third countries will continue to be restricted until at least the middle of June, he said, in compliance with the foreign ministry\u2019s global travel warning, which means that German citizens should not embark on foreign holidays to more distant locations. Greek health and civil protection authorities have rushed to a Roma camp in the country\u2019s heartland where an outbreak of coronavirus has caused consternation, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Athens correspondent. Infections are believed to have spread through the settlement, in the central city of Larissa, after more than 150 people attended the funeral of a man who died of the virus. About 3,000 men, women and children live in highly congested conditions in the camp. State TV reported that, so far, around 500 residents had been tested for Covid-19 following the detection of a new outbreak over the weekend and 10 new cases on Tuesday. Contract tracing is also being conducted. Positive cases were being transferred for quarantine to a medical centre specially installed in the area, according to the civil protection authority. The camp, in a locale known as Nea Smyrni, was initially placed under quarantine last month after a 32-year-old man tested positive for the virus. The man is believed to have broken lockdown regulations ordered by the government. At the time, the nation\u2019s chief infectious disease expert, Prof Sotiris Tsiodras, had described the outbreak as indicative of the dangers at large in dealing with a highly contagious disease. \u201cThe example of Larissa shows just how fragile the situation is,\u201d he said. By adopting strict restrictions and lockdown measures \u2013 now being gradually eased \u2013 Greece to date has handled the coronavirus pandemic well, recording 2,744 confirmed cases and a death toll of 152. The head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies has recommended wearing face masks in public spaces amid reports that the government is considering making their use compulsory, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. At the moment, masks must only be worn on public transport and have been handed out at train and metro stations. But according to various newspapers, the Spanish health ministry is consulting with regional governments to see whether the use of masks should become mandatory. Speaking at his daily press conference on Wednesday morning, Fernando Sim\u00f3n said: \u2018The use of face masks is very advisable and everyone who can should use them in public spaces.\u201d However, Sim\u00f3n has also pointed out that masks may not be suitable for children, those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other breathing difficulties, or those who are prone to anxiety. Rightwing extremists and Islamic militants could exploit the coronavirus crisis by staging attacks on medics and hospitals, the European Union\u2019s top counterterrorism official has warned. In a confidential briefing, obtained on Wednesday by the Associated Press, the counter-terrorism coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove, said extremists could view attacks on medical staff as an effective way of generating shocks to society. He noted that in the US, the FBI in March shot and killed a white supremacist while trying to arrest him for plotting to blow up a hospital treating Covid-19 patients, after initially considering an attack on an African-American school, mosque or synagogue. From past experience, he said it is known that terrorists and violent extremists, aiming to change societies and governmental systems through violence, seek to exploit major crises to achieve their objectives. De Kerchove noted that the Islamic State group, for example, emerged after the US-led invasion of Iraq and then gained strength during the Arab spring uprisings. In Europe, leftwing extremists are paying extensive attention to the pandemic, blaming governments and the capitalist system as a whole for it, saying politicians have underfunded healthcare services, de Kerchove wrote in the analysis. The document was circulated among EU member states on 7 May and first reported on Wednesday by Germany\u2019s Die Zeit newspaper\u2019s online edition. Day one of post-lockdown in France and the pavements flanking Paris\u2019s Canal Saint-Martin and the pedestrianised roads along the banks of the Seine were invaded with newly liberated Parisians on Monday, forcing the police to evacuate the popular spots and issue a hastily drawn up ban on drinking alcohol in public places, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. Day two, and police moved in to shoo away people sitting on the steps leading to Sacr\u00e9 Coeur on Tuesday evening. City Hall says people are not actually breaking the rules, but \u201cif everyone decides to go to the same place at the same time, that\u2019s a problem\u201d, an official said. French ministers have urged everyone to behave \u201cresponsibly and civically\u201d. Day three, and Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo repeated her wish to see the capital\u2019s parks and gardens opened. Hidalgo has been lobbying the government for this, but without success. Health minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said it would be too much of a health risk, given that the Paris region remains \u201cred\u201d on the coronavirus map, where the virus is still circulating and hospital intensive care units are saturated. On Wednesday, Hidalgo told BFMTV: \u201cWe have to open the parks and gardens as a matter of public health. You can take the metro but not walk in a park? If we don\u2019t open them, Parisians will gather in other spaces, like pavements and (river) banks.\u201d The mayor agrees the end of lockdown measures have to be \u201cprogressive and with extreme care\u201d, and said she would make it mandatory to wear a mask in parks and gardens if they were allowed to reopen. There was a small spike in the number of Covid-19 hospital admissions reported at the daily update on Tuesday evening and an increase of 348 deaths in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total to just under 27,000. France has so far recorded 178,225 confirmed cases of coronavirus. In a vision of what may become the future for workers in many sectors, Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d, its chief executive officer, Jack Dorsey, said in a company-wide email on Tuesday, according to a report by Guardian US technology writer Kari Paul. A spokesperson from Twitter confirmed the decision to the Guardian, saying the company was \u201cone of the first companies to go to a work-from-home model\u201d due to Covid-19, but does not anticipate being one of the first to return to its offices. The company said in a blogpost: We were uniquely positioned to respond quickly and allow folks to work from home given our emphasis on decentralisation and supporting a distributed workforce capable of working from anywhere. The past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen. Eight more people have been found to be infected with coronavirus in Lebanon, the country\u2019s health ministry reports, as people there prepare to enter a four-day \u201ctotal lockdown\u201d to try to curtail a recent increase in infections. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country is now 878, of whom 26 have died and 236 have recovered. After Lebanon began tentative steps last month to emerge from its coronavirus lockdown, on Tuesday the government said it would impose an almost total ban on movement from 7pm local time on Wednesday until 5am on Monday. It came after the country recorded more than 100 new infections over four days, but also after protests erupted. According to a report by Martin Chulov, the Guardian\u2019s Middle East editor, earlier this month, a freeze on many salaries, controls on bank withdrawals and slashed spending on social services have ravaged household incomes. The Lebanese government estimates that 75% of the population are now in need of aid, including food aid. Among refugee communities, the need for food aid rises to 90%, according to the International Rescue Committee. Fifty more people have died from Covid-19 in Iran, the country\u2019s health ministry spokesman said on Wednesday, while 1,958 more people tested positive for coronavirus, in what has been the worst outbreak so far in the Middle East. In his daily televised address, reported by the Islamic Republic News Agency, Kianoush Jahanpour said the total number of infections detected in Iran had reached 112,725, of whom 89,428 have recovered. The total death toll in the country is now 6,783. Of those still ill with the disease, 2,735 cases are in a critical condition, Jahanpour said. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has passed 5,000 in Afghanistan as the health ministry warned that easing lockdowns will bring a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d, writes Akhtar Mohammad Makoii in Herat. Out of 619 suspected patients tested over the last 24 hours, 259 came back positive, pushing the total number of infections to 5,226. The death toll now stands at 132, after five more patients died overnight,. There has so far been 648 recoveries. Wahid Majrooh, the deputy health minister, warned people to heed the precautions and stay at home, adding: \u201cIf people continue to crowd on the streets and don\u2019t heed [warnings], the catastrophe of coronavirus will continue to surge in cities.\u201d The northern province of Balkh recorded its worst day, after 49 patients tested positive. There have so far been 437 infections and 17 deaths in the province. The number of transmissions continued to surge in Kandahar on Wednesday, with 29 new cases confirmed in the southern province. The governor of Kandahar is also struggling with the virus after he was infected last week. The capital, Kabul, which is Afghanistan\u2019s worst-affected area with 1,368 confirmed cases, reported 27 new infections. Kabul has so far recorded 18 deaths from Covid-19. The western province of Herat, which has the highest number of deaths, recorded 22 new confirmed cases. The first case of Covid-19 in Afghanistan was reported in Herat and thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. Confirmed cases in the remote province of Zabul reached 30 after three more infections confirmed today. The province\u2019s only hospital was destroyed in a Taliban attack last year. Majrooh also said the death toll of Tuesday\u2019s attack on a maternity hospital in Kabul reached 24, with 16 wounded, while 18 newborn babies were rescued from the scene. Scientists say that the dramatic improvements in air quality associated with the coronavirus lockdown may bring warmer temperatures and heavier monsoon rains this year, writes Kate Ravilious for the Guardian\u2019s science desk. With factories closed and roads relatively empty, air pollution in cities across Asia, Europe and the US has dropped by as much as 60% in recent weeks. The lack of haze has made skies bluer and some people in northern India have been able to see the Himalayas for the first time in 30 years. It also means that with fewer particles and polluting gases to hinder its path, more sunlight is able to reach the Earth\u2019s surface. Earlier this year, scientists confirmed that cleaner skies in recent decades have caused a brightening of the Earth\u2019s surface. Satellite measurements show that Europe experienced a surface dimming effect until the late 1980s, followed by a brightening effect as air pollution regulations kicked in. China followed a similar pattern, but had to wait until 2005 for brightening to set in. The cleaner skies resulting from lockdown are likely to have enhanced the brightening effect even further, but measuring the impact on climate is not straightforward. \u201cAerosols can scatter and absorb radiation. They can also modify clouds to make them more reflective and longer lived,\u201d explains Laura Wilcox, a climate scientist at the University of Reading. Surging death tolls in northern Nigeria have sparked fears that coronavirus is spreading out and combining with established diseases to pose a lethal threat in a region where medical care is poor, AFP reports. In the past month, the city of Kano, the most populous city in the north of the country, has witnessed hundreds of deaths, particularly among older people. At first authorities blamed the fatalities on ailments including diabetes, hypertension and malaria \u2013 but a team of government investigators later said most were suspected to be linked to coronavirus. Kano state has officially confirmed 666 infections and 32 deaths from coronavirus, making it the hardest-hit region in Nigeria after megacity Lagos. Testing has been severely limited but as capacity has picked up in recent days so the number of cases has climbed steadily. Now the surge in unexplained deaths has spread to neighbouring areas, sending local authorities scrambling to figure out the cause. As a whole, Nigeria has so far reported 4,787 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 158 deaths. Rightwing militia groups in Michigan plan to rally at the state capitol building on Thursday to protest Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home orders, writes Tom Perkins in Detroit. Thursday\u2019s demonstration will be the latest in a series of protests that started as a demonstration against the lockdown policy but are now generating fears of an eruption of political violence. The state is currently investigating what the Michigan attorney general, Dana Nessel, characterized on Monday as \u201ccredible threats\u201d against state Democratic politicians. Her comments followed a report of threats of violence on rightwing social media pages. Residents posting in the Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine Facebook page called for Whitmer\u2019s assassination. \u201cWonder how long till she\u2019s hit with a shotgun blast,\u201d one wrote. Another said they hope Thursday\u2019s protesters are \u201carmed to the teeth\u201d because \u201cvoting is too late\u201d. Dramatic images from a 30 April protest showed militia members carrying assault rifles while glaring and shouting from the galleries of the state legislature as an emotional debate over extending a stay-at-home order took place. In response, a black lawmaker last week came to Michigan\u2019s capitol with an escort of armed black citizens. Spain\u2019s daily death toll from the coronavirus inched up on Wednesday to 184 fatalities from 176 on Tuesday, Reuters reports. The overall death toll from the disease rose to 27,104, according to the health ministry\u2019s daily report, while the overall number of diagnosed cases rose to 228,691 from 228,030 the prior day. The latest figures came as two foreign ministry sources told Reuters that Spanish authorities are planning to keep borders closed to most travellers from abroad until July, in a move to try and avoid a second wave of epidemic. Land borders with France and Portugal have been closed since a state of emergency was declared in mid-March to fight the pandemic, pushing the economy to a near stand-still and hitting its key tourism sector hard. Spain has started easing the lockdown for its residents as the pandemic gets under control and decided in parallel to apply a two-week quarantine for foreign travellers, practically shutting the border to air and maritime travel to avoid importing new cases from other countries. The quarantine measure is due to expire on 24 May when the state of emergency lapses, but both can be extended. In any case, restrictions on travel are likely to remain in place for much longer, no matter how crucial tourism is for the Spanish economy, the sources told Reuters. \u201cWhen we reach the new normal we can start opening borders with Schengen countries, we are talking about opening to these countries in early July,\u201d one of the sources said.

Here\u2019s something from Reuters about the relaxation of Germany\u2019s border controls: Germany will start to ease some of the border controls introduced to slow the spread of the coronavirus from Saturday with the aim of having free travel in Europe from 15 June, Interior Minster Horst Seehofer said on Wednesday. Seehofer said that general border controls agreed with France, Switzerland and Austria due to end on 15 May would be extended until 16 June but as many crossings as possible would be reopened. \u201cThe goal is that from mid-June we want to have free travel in Europe,\u201d he said, adding that controls could be re-imposed if there are new outbreaks. We have previously reported on the boom in bicycle sales in Britain and in Australia. This just in from the US: Such is the demand for bicycles that Denver bike shop co-owner Phillip Brown and his colleagues can\u2019t build them quick enough. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this industry 15 years and nothing even close,\u201d says Brown, 36. \u201cThis is, I would say, twice the demand increase that we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Since the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March, a cycling boom has been under way across the US. The National Association of City Transport Officials (NACTO) says they are seeing an \u201cexplosion in cycling\u201d in many American cities. Eco-Counter, which collects bike data, reports that bicycle counts have \u201csignificantly increased\u201d across most of North America compared to usual. In the two weeks to 4 May, it found the US region with the most growth was the south-west, which was up by over 100%. More here: New coronavirus hotspots are emerging in Republican heartland communities across multiple states, contradicting Donald Trump\u2019s claims that infection rates are declining across the nation. At a fraught press briefing on Monday, the president declared: \u201cAll throughout the country, the numbers are coming down rapidly.\u201d Yet county-specific figures show a surge in infection rates in towns and rural communities in red states such as Texas, Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky and North and South Dakota, according to data tracking by the New York Times. Trump\u2019s claim is also contradicted by data used by the White House\u2019s own pandemic taskforce to track new and emerging hotspots. More here: A Russian healthcare watchdog has suspended the use of a domestically manufactured ventilator suspected to have caused two deadly fires in Russian hospitals in the last week. Six people died and hundreds were forced to evacuate hospitals in Moscow and St Petersburg after the Russian-made ventilators were said to have ignited, apparently while patients were attached. On Wednesday, Russia\u2019s federal service for surveillance in healthcare said it would suspend the use of new Aventa-M ventilators produced after 1 April pending a safety review, a decision that will affect hundreds of machines. Aventa-M ventilators were also sold to the United States last month during a controversial aid mission negotiated by Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. US hospitals reportedly had not used the ventilators because they were manufactured for the wrong voltage. It is not clear when those ventilators were produced. The US federal emergency management agency (FEMA) said on Tuesday that the ventilators were not in use in US hospitals and that local authorities would return the machines to FEMA. Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee has said it is investigating the fires in Russian hospitals. The decision by the Russian watchdog could affect hundreds of ventilators that have been produced since April as Russian hospitals sought new supplies to prepare for a flood of coronavirus cases. Five coronavirus patients, some reportedly attached to ventilators, died in the early hours of Tuesday after a fire broke out at the St George hospital in St Petersburg. A fire last week at a Moscow hospital treating coronavirus patients also killed one person. That fire may also have been tied to a faulty ventilator. Both hospitals were reportedly using Aventa-M ventilators produced by a state-run factory in Russia\u2019s Urals region. An April tender showed that last month the St George hospital had ordered 237 ventilators from the factory, which is the only manufacturer of that ventilator in the country. The continuing ban on public and religious gatherings in Nigeria has led to increasingly divided reactions from Churches in Nigeria. In recent weeks, two of the most influential mega-church pastors in the country have grown in hostility to the government\u2019s lockdown measures, and questioned the severity of the pandemic altogether. Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith Tabernacle has been among the most ardent critics of the ban on places of worship. Its main branch on the outskirts of Lagos draws 50,000 people. Earlier this week Oyedepo said the closure of churches while hospitals and markets were open amounted to a conspiracy against Churches. \u201cThere is something wrong; for people to be allowed to be in the market for six hours and can\u2019t be in church for two hours. I can smell a rat,\u201d he said this week. \u201cThe voice of darkness is influencing people at various levels, targeting the church because the growth and expansion of the church is the greatest headache of the devil. I declare churches open.\u201d Pastor Chris Oyakhilome\u2019s Christ Embassy is spread around the world with a main branch in Lagos seating 30,000 people. The pastor has been a consistent critic of measures to tackle the pandemic. \u201cThe lockdown is not science,\u201d he said in a sermon on Tuesday. The wearing of facemasks in public was \u201can embarrassment to science\u201d, he added. He has also previously linked Covid-19 to 5G mobile phone networks, fuelling a conspiracy theory that has spread around the world. Both church leaders have faced criticism for their comments, not least from fellow church pastors. Pastor Tunde Bakare, the head of The Citadel Global Community Church, where the main hall in Lagos seats 5,000, this week donated two church buildings and a private residence to Nigerian states for isolation centres. \u201cChurches with multiple facilities, rather than their leaders criticising the government should collaborate with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must be prepared to offer some of their halls to the government as isolation centres, in support of the efforts of the government.\u201d In a further boost to Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 response, the Catholic Church in Nigeria this week donated all of its 425 medical facilities across the country to the government to serve as isolation and treatment centres. Nigeria\u2019s predominantly deeply religious population is evenly split between Christians and Muslims according to government surveys. The effect of the lockdown on religious life has been immense. Yet many Nigerian Christians are increasingly calling on the country\u2019s mega churches to donate their now empty auditoriums as the country rushes to build its health capacity. New infections of Covid-19 in Nigeria are growing, now at 4,787, doubling in the last 12 days. 158 people have lost their lives and 959 people have recovered. Reuters have filed this update from Poland: Poland will extend its strict border controls until 12 June due to the coronavirus pandemic, its Interior Ministry said on Wednesday. Poland closed its borders to foreigners in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus and has extended the restriction four times since then. Polish citizens, diplomats, foreigners with the legal right to live in Poland and foreign professional drivers can enter Poland at selected checkpoints. While keeping borders closed, Poland is easing some other curbs imposed earlier. It has reopened shopping malls, hotels, outdoor playgrounds and allowed kindergartens to restart. The government is expected to announce on Wednesday the lifting of further restrictions on schools, restaurants and hairdressers. Poland now has 17,062 confirmed coronavirus cases and 847 deaths. On Tuesday, the country saw its largest spike in new coronavirus cases in one day due to a rapid growth in infections among coal miners. Malaysia has reported 37 new cases of coronavirus, taking its cumulative total to 6,779 infections. The health ministry has also reported two new deaths, raising the total number of confirmed fatalities from the outbreak to 111. Iceland is preparing to ease their immigration restrictions, with some professionals including scientists, filmmakers and athletes eligible for a modified quarantine from Friday, and more widespread changes starting no later than 15 June. Thordis Kolbrun Reykfjord Gylfadottir, minister of tourism, industry and innovation, said: \u201cWhen travellers return to Iceland we want to have all mechanisms in place to safeguard them and the progress made in controlling the pandemic. Iceland\u2019s strategy of large-scale testing, tracing and isolating have proven effective so far. We want to build on that experience of creating a safe place for those who want a change of scenery after what has been a tough spring for all of us.\u201d The new rules to be introduced next month are expected to consist of visitors being given a choice between a coronavirus test on arrival or a two-week quarantine, as well as the use of the country\u2019s official tracing app. The country has recorded 1,801 cases and 10 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins, with only three new cases confirmed so far this month. When James, 34, started looking for a house near his new workplace in Malawi\u2019s capital, Lilongwe, he was not expecting any hurdles. As a new medical doctor with a job at a public hospital he would normally be an ideal tenant for any landlord. When he called about an apartment, the landlady confirmed it was vacant but when he said he was a doctor, she seemed to cool. When he arrived the next day to view the apartment, she said somebody else was taking it. \u201cThat was when I realised that I had made a blunder \u2026 by announcing my profession. Her response just confirmed the fears that doctors like me looking to rent have \u2013 that they will be refused out of fear of the virus,\u201d said James, who asked to use only his first name. Health workers, once held in high regard in Malawi, are being stigmatised because of of the coronavirus pandemic. More here: Russia registered more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, continuing a grim trend that has seen the country become a global virus hotspot, AFP reports. Health officials reported 10,028 new cases over the last 24 hours, bringing Russia\u2019s total number of infections to 242,271. The Kremlin this week eased a national lockdown to slow the spread of the virus, despite a steady rise in numbers that has brought Russia to second place in a global tally of infections, behind the United States. A majority of Russia\u2019s new cases were registered in the capital, a government virus tally said, where Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, has extended a lockdown until the end of May. Despite the steady rise in new cases, Russia\u2019s reported mortality rate is significantly lower compared to other European countries hit hard by the pandemic, with 96 new deaths and a total of 2,212 dead from the coronavirus as of Wednesday. Authorities say the low mortality rate is because Russia was able to learn lessons from the experiences of western Europe, moving quickly to isolate travellers and people at risk, convert hospitals for virus patients and launch a vast campaign to test and quarantine those infected. Authorities on Monday said they had carried out nearly six million tests. But critics have cast doubt on the figures, accusing authorities of under-counting by blaming virus-related deaths on other causes. Here are the latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom: Tui plans to cut up to 8,000 jobs in response to the coronavirus chaos engulfing the tourism industry. Europe\u2019s largest travel group said it needed to reduce costs permanently to tackle \u201cunquestionably the greatest crisis the industry and Tui has ever faced\u201d. It lost \u20ac740m (\u00a3650m) in the first three months of the year, requiring a rapid German state bailout as the company bled cash and cancelled most of its holidays until June. Travel restrictions in most of its main markets have destroyed demand for holidays, with nine in 10 Tui employees furloughed or given pay cuts in a desperate attempt to lower costs. Tui had more than 70,000 employees in September. More here: Here\u2019s a summary of all the latest data on coronavirus in Australia, which hopefully gives a picture of how Covid-19 is affecting Australians and helps track the impact of government measures: As French schools reopen this morning, there\u2019s still no sign of activity at the country\u2019s Amazon warehouses. Amazon plans to extend the closure of its French warehouses until 18 May, the company has announced. Its six French warehouses have been closed since 16 April following court rulings that ordered it to restrict deliveries during the Covid-19 pandemic or face hefty fines. Amazon said it was continuing to consult with staff representatives and was also reviewing a request for an additional independent expert report. Singapore\u2019s health ministry has confirmed another 675 cases of confirmed coronavirus infections, taking the city-state\u2019s tally to 25,346. 21 people have so far died. The border between Austria and Germany will be completely opened from 15 June, Austria\u2019s tourism minister, Elisabeth K\u00f6stinger, has told the country\u2019s public service broadcaster, ORF. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, have agreed on a two-step plan to ease travel restrictions, she said, with some restrictions on border traffic to be eased from Friday and controls to be completely lifted from 15 June. The former Fortescue Metals chief executive Nev Power, handpicked by the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison to be his Covid-19 coordination adviser, is being paid $500,000 (about \u00a3264,000) for six months\u2019 work. Power\u2019s remuneration was revealed at a hearing of the Senate inquiry into the management of the coronavirus crisis, where senators focused on whether there were proper processes in place for members of the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission to declare any conflicts of interest, given that many are company directors. It was also revealed during the inquiry that Andrew Liveris, the former chairman and chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company, who has been engaged as a special adviser to the NCCC on manufacturing, was not required to declare potential conflicts in the way that commissioners were. The British Office for National Statistics has announced that UK economy contracted by 2% in the first quarter of 2020 after plunging 5.8% in March as the coronavirus crisis took hold: Good morning. Simon Burnton here, taking over for the next few hours. You can contact me on Twitter @Simon_Burnton or by email here. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thank you to those of you who sent tips via email and Twitter. I hope your day goes better than it did for the owners of these gardens: Here are the latest developments from the last few hours: Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,261,955 people around the world are known to have contracted the virus, while at least 291,964 have died since the pandemic began. The numbers, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing recording and testing regimes. More than 147,000 Americans could die by early August \u2013 study. A newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts more than 147,000 Americans could die from Covid-19 by early August, up nearly 10,000 from the last projection, as restrictions for curbing the pandemic are increasingly relaxed, researchers said on Tuesday. The current US death toll stands at 82,376. Brazil reports record deaths. Brazil reported a record 881 Covid-19 deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest. US Senate threatens sanctions on China over Covid-19 accounting. US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents. The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus, according to local media. Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019. Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday. A spokesperson from Twitter confirmed the decision to the Guardian. India PM announces US$270bn virus economic package. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a stimulus package for labourers and small businesses on Tuesday worth about 10% of India\u2019s GDP. The package came as the country was set to mark its 50th day in the world\u2019s biggest lockdown as the number of virus cases topped 70,000 with 2,200 deaths. Global report: Brazil and Mexico record deadliest day from Covid-19 Brazil and Mexico have both seen deaths from Covid-19 spike on their deadliest days yet as the coronavirus pandemic threatened to worsen throughout the Americas. The health ministry in Brazil on Tuesday reported 881 fatalities from the disease in 24 hours, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country for deaths, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Brazil\u2019s total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the seventh highest in the world. The United States remains by far the worst affected country and now has almost a third of the world\u2019s 4.26m cases, with a national death toll of 82,339. The fatality figure could rise much higher according to modelling from the University of Washington that predicted more than 147,000 Americans would die from Covid-19 by early August \u2013 up nearly 10,000 from the last projection. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government\u2019s top public health expert, has told senators that the real death toll was probably higher and Americans could face \u201cserious consequences\u201d if safeguards were relaxed too soon. Fashion police: South Africa\u2019s minister for trade and industry, Ebrahim Patel, has published a list of the clothing items people are allowed to buy under Level 4 restrictions in the country. The list, which seems to mainly include winter clothing items, is at times oddly specific, with one item \u2013 \u201ccrop bottoms worn with boots and leggings\u201d \u2013 provoking mockery (and confusion) online. Among the other items included are: short sleeved knit tops, where promoted and displayed as worn under cardigans and knitwear; short sleeved t-shirts, where promoted and displayed as under garments for warmth; shirts, either short- or long-sleeved, where displayed and promoted to be worn under jackets coats and/or knitwear; The minister later said that the list had been published at the request of clothing retailers. The UN Security Council is trying again to reach agreement on its first resolution since the coronavirus pandemic started circling the globe over two months ago, but a dispute between the US and China over mentioning the World Health Organization remains unresolved, AP reports. The United States on Friday objected to a proposed resolution drafted by France and Tunisia after diplomats said it had agreed to compromise language with China that didn\u2019t directly mention the UN health agency. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Israel for talks on regional security and the Jewish state\u2019s controversial plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. In a rare foreign trip during the coronavirus pandemic, Pompeo plans to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and incoming defence minister Benny Gantz a day before a unity government agreed between the two men is scheduled to be sworn in. How big tech plans to profit from the pandemic It has taken some time to gel, but something resembling a coherent pandemic shock doctrine is beginning to emerge. Call it the Screen New Deal. Far more hi-tech than anything we have seen during previous disasters, the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent \u2013 and highly profitable \u2013 no-touch future. This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screen \u201cshared\u201d on a mediated platform. It\u2019s a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control), and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. It\u2019s a future that claims to be run on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, but is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centres, content-moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyper-exploitation. It\u2019s a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants. Nature is healing in San Jose, California: Thailand has recorded zero new coronavirus cases for the first time since 9 March, Rueters reports. Thailand has 3,017 confirmed cases and 56 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,261,955 people around the world are known to have contracted the virus, while at least 291,964 have died since the pandemic began. The numbers, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing recording and testing regimes. More than 147,000 Americans could die by early August \u2013 study. A newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts more than 147,000 Americans will die from Covid-19 by early August, up nearly 10,000 from the last projection, as restrictions for curbing the pandemic are increasingly relaxed, researchers said on Tuesday. The current US death toll stands at 82,376. Brazil reports record deaths. Brazil reported a record 881 Covid-19 deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest. US Senate threatens sanctions on China over Covid-19 accounting. US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization. Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents. The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus, according to local media. It was widely believed that this will be done within 10 days. However, Chinese media reports have given some more clarity today, suggesting that while there is a citywide testing plan, the time limit is for each region on staggered start times. Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019. Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday. Twitter has \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d working from home since 2 March and mandated employees to work from home starting 11 March. Those who want to return to the office will probably need to wait until at least September. India PM announces US$270bn virus economic package. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a stimulus package for labourers and small businesses on Tuesday worth about 10% of India\u2019s GDP. The package came as the country was set to mark its 50th day in the world\u2019s biggest lockdown as the number of virus cases topped 70,000 with 2,200 deaths. Pence avoiding Trump after aide\u2019s positive test. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, is keeping his distance from Donald Trump after the former\u2019s press secretary tested positive, the White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany has confirmed. Fauci warns of serious consequences if US states reopen early. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has warned of serious consequences if US states reopen before building capacity to deal with new Covid-19 outbreaks. French schools reopen. Thousands of schools have reopened throughout France as the government eased its lockdown rules, despite fears of a second waves of infections, Agence France-Presse reports. Podcast: do we need more than one Covid-19 vaccine? Hannah Devlin speaks to Prof Andrew Pollard about the work being done by different teams around the world to create a vaccine for Covid-19, and where his team at Oxford University fit into this international effort Yemen faces spectre of coronavirus amid aid cuts Ramadan is a quiet affair in Yemen this year. \u201cPeople are very afraid,\u201d said Ahmed, an aid worker in the Houthi rebel-controlled capital, Sana\u2019a, who asked for his last name to be withheld. \u201cThere\u2019s no money, there\u2019s no healthcare and now you can\u2019t even celebrate iftar with family because of the coronavirus.\u201d Yemen, where five years of war have already created the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, is uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite a unilateral ceasefire announced by Saudi Arabia last month, there has been an uptick in fighting between the Houthis and the Saudi and Emirati-led coalition fighting on behalf of Yemen\u2019s government, as well as renewed hostilities between the coalition and separatist forces in the country\u2019s south. The fresh violence, combined with humanitarian funding shortfalls and cuts, means Covid-19 could not have arrived at a worse time: EU faces \u2018existential threat\u2019 if coronavirus recovery is uneven The risk of an uneven economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis poses an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the European Union, one of its most senior economic policymakers has said. Paolo Gentiloni, a former Italian prime minister and now the EU\u2019s economy commissioner, said the bloc also had a \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d as it charts a plan to rescue Europe\u2019s economy. In an interview a few days after the commission said Europe had entered \u201cthe deepest economic recession in its history\u201d, Gentiloni said the EU needed a \u201csound recovery plan\u201d to avoid the risks of economic division. Shuttered shops and factories, grounded planes and stay-at-home consumers as a result of lockdown restrictions mean the EU economy is expected to shrink by 7.5% in 2020, a deeper fall than the 2009 financial crisis. Chinese authorities are preparing to test all 11 million residents of Wuhan, after a small outbreak in the city earlier this week. It\u2019s been widely believed that this will be done within 10 days - an extraordinary undertaking for a city of 11 million people. However, Chinese media reports have given some more clarity today, suggesting that while there is a citywide testing plan, the time limit is for each region on staggered start times. \u201cEach district shall make arrangements for nucleic acid screening plan for all members within 10 days,\u201d said a Wuhan government notice. Caixin Global reported some districts will start this week, and some next.The article cited Wuhan disease control officials saying the testing will be done by third party companies and some hospital and disease control employees. However, it said the rate of testing couldn\u2019t see more than 100,000 a day. On Tuesday Yicai news said Wuchang district was to be screened between 13 May and 20 May, but with the intention of finishing by the 17 may to allow three days \u201cto find out and fill in the gaps\u201d. A resident of Jianghan, once the worst-hit district of Wuhan, told media he\u2019d received a registration form on Tuesday for himself and his family to either report having been tested or register for testing. Peng Zhiyong, director of the intensive care unit at the Wuhan University\u2019s Zhongnan Hospital, told the Global Times that he hadn\u2019t received any details of the testing plan as of Tuesday. The lifting of coronavirus lockdowns in China has given the stuttering auto industry a jumpstart, with sales rising for the first time in two years as buyers return as the health crisis eases, AFP reports. Sales in the world\u2019s biggest car market began to slide in 2018 and plunged further when the pandemic paralysed the economy, but they have rebounded as the country tames the virus and lifts restrictions on travel and businesses. Sales rose 4.4% year-on-year in April, the latest figures from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers show, driven by strong demand for commercial vehicles, which soared more than 30%. The recent uptick came as China emerged from months of lockdown and restrictions on movement imposed around the country earlier this year to curb the spread of the virus. Passenger car sales suffered at the time, plunging close to 80% from a year ago in February, according to China Passenger Car Association data. Asian markets fell again Wednesday after Donald Trump\u2019s top virus adviser warned that easing lockdown measures too early could spark another dangerous wave of infections and batter the economic recovery, AFP reports. Brewing tensions between the US and China added another layer of concern for traders after lawmakers in Washington proposed giving the president powers to impose fresh sanctions if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. Tokyo ended the morning down 0.8%, while Hong Kong dropped 0.2% and Shanghai slipped 0.3%. Sydney shed 0.9%, while there were also losses in Seoul, Singapore, Manila, Jakarta and Wellington. The second day of selling followed losses on Wall Street and eats into recent gains driven by slowing infection and death rates, and the lifting of economy-strangling measures that kept billions at home. The recent optimism that has flowed through markets, helped by trillions of dollars in worldwide stimulus and central bank backstopping, has been given a jolt by data showing fresh outbreaks in South Korea, China and Germany. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 798 to 171,306, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Wednesday. The reported death toll rose by 101 to 7,634, the tally showed. Launched amid the mounting scare over the coronavirus, a Japanese video chat website designed for hosting virtual drinking parties has soared in popularity while bars and pubs remain shut, Reuters reports. Nomikai, or drinking gatherings, are seen by many Japanese as central to building strong relationships among friends and workmates to bond. Tapping into that culture, Tacnom - which means drinks at home in Japanese - has attracted 2.4 million users in its first two months. \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect this impact and I\u2019m extremely happy,\u201d Takashi Kiyose, chief executive of Tacnom\u2019s operator 1010 Inc, told Reuters. Tacnom does not require downloads or registrations unlike other online video platforms, but its users can create a URL link and share with their friends to join virtual gatherings of up to 12 people. \u201cI hope our service can help users meet people they cannot see now. I would be very happy if their time at home due to self-restraints from going out will be enriched,\u201d Kiyose said. Japan remains under a state of emergency until end of May. The move allows local municipalities to urge people to stay inside, but without punitive measures or legal force. The country has reported about 15,000 coronavirus cases, and 633 deaths from the virus. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. China reported seven new coronavirus infections on the mainland on 12 May, versus one a day earlier, the national health authority said on Wednesday. Of the seven new cases reported by mainland China today, six are people who were infected by local transmission in Jilin province, which borders Russia and North Korea. Authorities have now ordered stricter lockdown measures in response. According to Beijing News, residents of Jilin city must get tested for the virus at their own expense and obtain a negative result before being allowed to travel to other cities. They must also complete strict self quarantine. There are new requirements for entering and leaving residences, gatherings like dinner parties have been banned and public transportation has been suspended. It comes after the province\u2019s Shulan city was reclassified as high risk and ordered to partially shut down this week after confirming 12 cases. Mexico\u2019s government gave the green light on Tuesday for the key automotive industry to restart production after weeks of disruption by the coronavirus pandemic, a decision that should pave the way to reopen North American supply chains, Reuters reports. The government\u2019s health committee, which issues binding sanitation rules, said it agreed to add makers of transport equipment, a category that includes automotive and aerospace industries, to the list of activities considered essential. Mexican auto output fell nearly 99% in April, and the government is under pressure from the United States to synchronize its restart with American companies that rely on supply chains from south of the border. The virus outbreak in Mexico is several weeks behind the US epidemic however, and health authorities have been cautious to avoid moving too fast and putting more lives at risk. Mexico\u2019s Social Security Institute said 555,247 people registered with it lost their jobs in April, while Mexico\u2019s daily death toll on Tuesday was its highest yet from the outbreak. Podcast: What does the biggest economic slump in 300 years mean for Britain As the chancellor announces plans to extend the unprecedented scheme to pay the wages of millions of workers, whole sectors of the economy remain shut because of Covid-19, causing a recession unseen in Britain for centuries. Larry Elliott explains what it will mean for the country: Foreign Policy has obtained a leaked data set from a Chinese military university which it says could give extraordinary insight into the accuracy of China\u2019s published statistics \u2013 but is not being shared with other countries or the World Health Organisation. \u201cBeijing claims that since the coronavirus pandemic began at the end of last year, there have been only 82,919 confirmed cases and 4,633 deaths in mainland China,\u201d the report says. \u201cThose numbers could be roughly accurate, and in that case a detailed account would be an important tool in judging the spread of the virus. But it\u2019s also possible that the numbers presented to the rest of the world are vastly understated compared to Beijing\u2019s private figures.\u201d According to Foreign Policy, the dataset has incredibly detailed breakdowns of the country\u2019s epidemic, with more than 640,000 information updates from 230 cities. \u201cEach update includes the latitude, longitude, and \u2018confirmed\u2019 number of cases at the location, for dates ranging from early February to late April,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe dataset, though it contains inconsistencies\u2014and though it may not be comprehensive enough to contradict Beijing\u2019s official numbers\u2014is the most extensive dataset proved to exist about coronavirus cases in China. But more importantly, it can serve as a valuable trove of information for epidemiologists and public health experts around the globe\u2014a dataset that Beijing has almost certainly not shared with US officials or doctors.\u201d Lives have been lost in the coronavirus pandemic because of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) exclusion of Taiwan and refusal to allow it to share best practices and information, a top US government commission on China said in a new report. The United States has repeatedly clashed with China over its refusal to allow non-WHO member Taiwan, claimed by China as one of its provinces, full access to the body, becoming another source of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing, Reuters reports. Taiwan says China and the WHO have conspired for political purposes to lock it out of key meetings, that the WHO has not responded to its requests for coronavirus information and that the WHO has previously misreported Taiwan\u2019s virus case numbers. The WHO and China strongly dispute this, saying Taiwan has been given all the help it needs, but that only China has the right to represent the democratic island in the WHO. In a report released on Tuesday, the US Congress\u2019 US-China Economic and Security Review Commission said Taiwan\u2019s exclusion contributed to \u201ccritical delays\u201d in timely receipt and accurate guidance for WHO members in the early stages of the outbreak. \u201cHad the WHO allowed Taiwan\u2019s health experts to share information and best practices in early January, governments around the world could have had more complete information on which to base their public health policies,\u201d it said. The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay reports: \u201cThere is no playbook for the recovery we are about to embark on but nor do we need one,\u201d Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, has said in a speech the day before her government unveils its annual Budget. \u201cWhen it has come to Covid-19 we have carved a path based on our people, our health system, and our economy. And now that is exactly what we will do again, as we recover and rebuild.\u201d Her comments came as New Zealand recorded a second consecutive day of no new Covid-19 cases, and prepares to loosen lockdown restrictions further on Thursday. Warning that her finance minister\u2019s spending plan would be unveiled during \u201cthe most challenging economic conditions faced by any government since the Great Depression,\u201d Ardern said the government would respond not with austerity but with investment. \u201cWe will run the ruler over every line of expenditure, no question we need to ensure our expenditure provides value for money and supports our primary goal of jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the notion that at this time of need we would make cuts to the essential services so many New Zealanders need more than ever is not only immoral, it is economically wrong.\u201d Her government yesterday made a pre-Budget announcement of $4 billion NZD for New Zealand\u2019s health system. Grant Robertson, the finance minister, has already allocated a stimulus of $22 billion NZD -- half of it on wage subsidies -- since Covid-19 reached New Zealand. You can read our preview of Robertson\u2019s Budget here: In other New Zealand news: the country\u2019s ban on large funerals and tangi has been described as \u201cinhumane\u201d by the opposition leader, and \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d by indigenous funeral directors. New Zealand is set to exit the coronavirus lockdown and resume many parts of normal life on Thursday, but restrictions on funerals and tangi remain, with only ten mourners permitted. The same rules also apply to weddings. Simon Bridges, the National party leader and a M\u0101ori man,said the limit of 10 mourners would cause added grief and pain for families wanting to say goodbye to a loved one. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that you can have 30 people on a rugby field playing close contact sport but you can\u2019t have more than ten people at a funeral so they can grieve together,\u201d Bridges said in a statement: The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay reports: New Zealand has reported a second consecutive day of no new cases of Covid-19, the day before the government further loosens lockdown restrictions on the country. 94% of the 1,147 people in New Zealand confirmed to have Covid-19 have recovered, said Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health, at a news conference in Wellington. 20 people have died of the coronavirus in New Zealand. There were no additional deaths on Wednesday. New Zealand\u2019s government has drawn praise for its strict and early lockdown of the country when just over 200 people had been diagnosed with Covid-19 and no one had died. A stringent month-long national shutdown followed. While restrictions have been loosened slightly already, the country will open further tomorrow, with New Zealanders allowed to socialise outside of their homes for the first time in groups of no larger than 10. Many more businesses will re-open, including cafes, shops and restaurants. Next week, schools and bars will re-open; schools had been operating in a limited capacity in recent weeks. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a $270bn stimulus package for labourers and small businesses on Tuesday, to boost flagging growth as the country grapples with the impact of the coronavirus and weeks-long lockdown. The package \u2013 worth about 10% of India\u2019s GDP \u2013 came as the country was set to mark its 50th day in the world\u2019s biggest lockdown as the number of virus cases topped 70,000 with 2,200 deaths. \u201cThis economic package is for India\u2019s self-reliant movement. It is for the cottage, small and medium scale industries,\u201d Modi said in a televised address. The funding includes a $2bn relief package announced at the start of the lockdown in late March and stimulus efforts by the central bank, Modi said. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman would unveil further details in the next few days, he added. Israeli police arrested over 300 people Tuesday as officers attempted to control crowds that had assembled at a religious site in northern Israel in violation of coronavirus restrictions, AP reports. Police said that despite regulations against large assemblies at Mount Meron and police checkpoints on roads near the site, hundreds of religious Jews turned up and some threw stones and other objects a police officers at the scene. Jews observed the holiday of Lag B\u2019Omer, on which ultra-Orthodox Jews customarily gather at the tomb of a prominent rabbi in antiquity on Mount Meron. Celebrations are typically marked with enormous crowds, dancing and the lighting of bonfires. Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Israelis marked the holiday in Jerusalem with large assemblies despite bans on public gatherings of more than 20 people due to the pandemic. Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community has been hit especially hard by the coronavirus outbreak. Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said earlier this week that around 70% of the country\u2019s more than 16,500 confirmed cases were ultra-Orthodox, who make up around 12% of Israel\u2019s population. Israel started easing restrictions on movement and gathering earlier this month. Israel has reported 260 deaths from Covid-19. More than half of those infected in Israel have recovered. Something a little lighter now, from AFP: A lovesick 20-year-old American man tried dressing up as a cleaner to cheat coronavirus border controls in Germany so he could see his girlfriend, police said Tuesday. After arriving at Frankfurt airport from Washington on Sunday, the young US national donned a high-visibility vest and picked up two bags of rubbish. \u201cHe then tried to convince security staff that he was a cleaner and was supposed to empty the bins behind the security area,\u201d federal police said in a statement. However, his plan was foiled when a member of staff noticed he was not wearing a security pass and couldn\u2019t speak German. He confessed at a police station that he was desperate to see his girlfriend and couldn\u2019t think of another way of entering the country. Even if he had managed to reach the bins, the man would still have been in the airport\u2019s transit area, police said \u2013 meaning he would still have faced more border controls. After being questioned, the young romantic was sent back to Washington on Monday. \u2018A generation-defining moment\u2019: delivering New Zealand\u2019s pandemic budget When Grant Robertson, New Zealand\u2019s finance minister, unveiled his last annual budget he told the country that its success would no longer be measured by economic growth and productivity, but instead by the wellbeing of the nation\u2019s population. A year on and one day before he reveals his new spending plan, Robertson\u2019s so-called wellbeing budget \u2013 a concept he intended would frame his fiscal policy for every future year of his term managing the country\u2019s books \u2013 faces an extraordinary and unexpected test: a dire global economic outlook caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, with local jobless numbers already topping those seen during the 2008 global financial crisis. It is a high-stakes document ahead of an election in September, which will function as a referendum on Robertson\u2019s ability to cushion the economy from fallout from plummeting tourism and paralysed industry. But far from abandoning the wellbeing approach, Robertson told the Guardian that the \u201chorrendous crisis that no one would have wanted to go through\u201d presented an opportunity for change in a country that appears to have largely quashed the spread of Covid-19. He cited child poverty, expensive housing, polluted waterways and rising emissions as matters to address in a pre-budget speech to a business audience early this month. \u201cIn other words, we are not quite the nation we like to think we are,\u201d he said. US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports. \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for the detrimental role they played in this pandemic,\u201d said Senator Jim Inhofe, one of the sponsors of the \u201cCovid-19 Accountability Act.\u201d \u201cTheir outright deception of the origin and spread of the virus cost the world valuable time and lives as it began to spread,\u201d he said in a statement. The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization. Trump must also certify that China has closed its highest-risk wet markets and released Hong Kong activists arrested in post-Covid-19 crackdowns. Without certification, Trump would be authorised under the legislation to impose sanctions like asset freezes, travel bans and visa revocations, as well as restricting Chinese businesses\u2019 access to US bank financing and capital markets. \u201cChina refuses to allow the international community to go into the Wuhan lab to investigate,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, another sponsor of the bill. \u201cThey refuse to allow investigators to study how this outbreak started. I\u2019m convinced China will never cooperate with a serious investigation unless they are made to do so.\u201d Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019 Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday. A spokesperson from Twitter confirmed the decision to the Guardian, saying the company was \u201cone of the first companies to go to a work-from-home model\u201d due to Covid-19, but does not anticipate being one of the first to return to its offices. \u201cWe were uniquely positioned to respond quickly and allow folks to work from home given our emphasis on decentralization and supporting a distributed workforce capable of working from anywhere,\u201d the company said in a blogpost. \u201cThe past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen.\u201d Brazil reported a record 881 Covid-19 deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest. Earlier far-right president Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 who has attacked social isolation measures introduced by state governors \u2013 issued a decree declaring beauty salons, gyms and barbers \u201cessential services\u201d that could open. Several governors said they would ignore the decree. Bolsonaro was also battling his latest political crisis \u2013 fears that a supreme court judge could release a video of an expletive-filled ministerial meeting held on April 22 which reportedly includes his foreign minister Ernesto Ara\u00fajo blaming China, Brazil\u2019s biggest trading partner, for the pandemic he dubbed a \u201ccomunavirus\u201d (or \u201ccommunist virus\u201d), aimed at dominating other nations. Ara\u00fajo had debuted the term in a lengthy text on his \u201canti-globalist\u201d blog the same day. \u201cThe coronavirus was again woken us up to the communist nightmare. The comunavirus has arrived,\u201d he wrote. Brazil\u2019s attorney-general\u2019s office had argued against handing over the video to the Supreme Court, claiming it contained \u201cpotentially sensitive and reserved state subjects, including foreign relations\u201d, but was overruled. Adding to the widening sense that Brazil\u2019s far right is increasingly disconnected from the horrific reality of the pandemic as it spreads into poorer, densely packed communities, the presidential family\u2019s guru Olavo de Carvalho questioned its very existence on Tuesday. \u201cThe fear of a supposedly deadly virus is nothing more than a horror story to cow the population and make them accept slavery as a gift from Santa Claus,\u201d tweeted the Richmond, Virginia-based, far-right astrologer-turned-philosopher, believed to have recommended Ara\u00fajo to the post, to his 291,000 followers. A newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts more than 147,000 Americans will die from Covid-19 by early August, up nearly 10,000 from the last projection, as restrictions for curbing the pandemic are increasingly relaxed, researchers said on Tuesday. The latest forecast from the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) reflects \u201ckey drivers of viral transmission like changes in testing and mobility, as well as easing of distancing policies,\u201d the report said. The current US death toll stands at 82,246. The revised projection reinforced public health warnings, including US Senate testimony on Tuesday from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, that prematurely lifting lockdowns could lead to more outbreaks of the respiratory virus. Fauci and other medical experts have urged caution in relaxing restraints on commerce before diagnostic testing and the ability to trace close contacts of infected individuals can be vastly expanded, along with other safeguards. Still, IHME researchers acknowledged that precise consequences of moves to reopen shuttered businesses and loosen stay-at-home orders remains difficult to gauge. Coronavirus in the Pacific: weekly briefing Dan McGarry and Tess Newton Cain report for the Guardian: Infection numbers in the region remain low, with minimal increase. New cases have been recorded in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), bringing the total across the region to 274. A number of countries have now been provided with GeneXpert testing cartridges by the World Health Oganization (WHO). They will allow for in-country testing and rapid processing of results. However, due to the global demand, there are only small numbers available in most places. For example, Tonga (where there are no confirmed cases) has requested 6,000 cartridges and has received 120. The idea of including Pacific island countries in a proposed trans-Tasman bubble being mooted by Australia and New Zealand has received a lot of attention among commentators, despite warnings from Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, that any relaxation of international border closures is still some way off. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting countries worldwide. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan, with you for the next few hours. Get in touch in Twitter @helenrsullivan. The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus over a period of just 10 days, according to local media. Officials were ordered to submit urgent plans to test all Wuhan\u2019s inhabitants after authorities reported six new cases in a residential compound, the first cluster of new Covid-19 infections since the city reopened on 8 April after 76 days of strict lockdown. Meanwhile in Brazil, where president Jair Bolsonaro has underplayed the dangers of the virus, a record 881 people died in one day, bringing the total number of deaths to 12,400. Confirmed infections stand at 177,589. Here are the other main developments from the last few hours. Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000.
