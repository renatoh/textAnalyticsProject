Drogba is currently a free agent after his 18-month contract at Galatasaray came to an end at the conclusion of the Turkish Super Lig season. Chelsea\u2019s attacking options have been bolstered by the signing of Diego Costa from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and the return of Romelu Lukaku from a season on loan at Everton, despite the Belgian\u2019s future remaining uncertain, but Jos\u00e9 Mourinho enjoys a strong relationship with Drogba having signed the 36-year-old from Marseille in 2004 during his first spell in charge at Stamford Bridge and, according to L\u2019Equipe, he is ready to bring him back to the club for a second spell, with the sale of Demba Ba to Besiktas last week for \u00a34.7m having freed up a place in the squad. Drogba won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the Champions League with Chelsea, scoring 157 goals during his eight-year spell in south-west London, culminating in scoring the equaliser and the winning penalty in the 2012 Champions League final. He had a brief spell in Shanghai before signing for Galatasaray in January 2013. Juventus are among other clubs to have registered their interest in the player."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
