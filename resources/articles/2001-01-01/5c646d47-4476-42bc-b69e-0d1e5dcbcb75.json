As caretaker manager at North End, Allardyce was given a Ford Fiesta van as his club car. Perhaps Bolton will supply their highly rated manager with something more appropriate. Allardyce's prime objective is to take Bolton back to the Premiership, but losing at home to their fellow promotion chasers West Bromwich will not help his ambition. The decision of the Bolton board to hand their Dudley-born manager a 10-year contract prior to the game was something that even Santa Claus would struggle to match. However, Bolton's defender Robbie Elliott did his best to surpass his club's board for generosity. Perhaps Elliott had been watching too many football howler videos over Christmas because his attempted back pass to Jussi Jaaskelainen had \"comedy error\" written all over it. The former Newcastle defender appeared to have all the time in the world as he sauntered away from goal with the ball at his feet but, instead of hitting a long pass to one of his forwards, he inexplicably turned around and directed a weak pass to Jaaskelainen. Jason Roberts could not believe his luck as the ball trundled past him, and he did not pass up the opportunity to score his 12th goal of the season as he rounded the goalkeeper before shooting into the empty net. Poor old Allardyce. Having just agreed his lengthy contract, he would have hoped for a celebratory victory at least. \"A draw would have been disappointing considering the chances we created, but to lose is even more hard to take,\" he said. \"Still, I've been told that if we'd lost 6-0, my new contract would have been reduced to four years.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
