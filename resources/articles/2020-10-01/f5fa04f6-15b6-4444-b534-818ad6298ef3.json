The club\u2019s record goalscorer has not played since 22 June because of a serious knee injury. Ag\u00fcero has trained promisingly in the past few days and Pep Guardiola is hopeful the 32-year-old will be in the team. \u201cWe have training in the morning and we\u2019ll decide if he\u2019s fit,\u201d the City manager said. \u201cHe\u2019s trained well the last two or three days but we cannot forget he was four or five months out. But he\u2019s near to start again, to handle the minutes, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d If Ag\u00fcero is available it will be a welcome boost because Gabriel Jesus, Guardiola\u2019s other frontline No 9, is unfit, while Kevin De Bruyne is also ruled out. De Bruyne withdrew from Belgium\u2019s squad this week and Guardiola suggested the midfielder may not recover from a muscle injury to face Porto in the Champions League on Wednesday or West Ham next weekend. \u201cI don\u2019t know [exactly how long],\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not much but in the next games he\u2019ll be out.\u201d Of Jesus, Guardiola said: \u201cHe has an injury in the part of his leg where if he injured it more he could be out for a long time. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be back for the Champions League.\u201d There is, though, optimism about Raheem Sterling, who suffered a hamstring strain with England. \u201cHe trained much better in the last few days,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThere were still some niggles [at first] but the last two or three days he feels better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
