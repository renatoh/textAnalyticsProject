Lee Westwood, the 2000 European No1, is here and so are his successor and his predecessor in that position, Retief Goosen and Colin Montgomerie. Justin Rose, winner last week in South Africa, is present, as are three other young guns of world golf - the Australians Adam Scott and Aaron Baddeley and England's Nick Dougherty. Those are the names that fill the billboards advertising the Johnnie Walker Classic, which starts today in Western Australia at the Lake Karrinyup Country Club. The names, in fact, that have enabled the organisers to entice the public with the promise that they can \"walk with the golfing gods\". There is, though, a name missing from that illustrious list, that of Geoff Nicholas. It is not a name that springs immediately to mind when flicking through the golfing galaxy, although perhaps it should be, given the bravery he displays every day in pursuing his chosen career. For Nicholas is an amputee. The 40-year-old from New South Wales was born with both legs deformed as a result of the drug Thalidomide and for him to be able to walk at all his right leg had to be amputated. The bones were then used to reconstruct his left leg and he then, at the age of 13, had to learn to walk. Most sports were obviously impossible for him. But golf was not only a possibility, it was a challenge he has met to a remarkable degree. He became good enough to turn professional and good enough to earn his card for the Australasian tour, and in 1992 he made his debut as a touring pro in the Perak Masters in Malaysia. When Jack Nicklaus heard of it, he sent him a card wishing him all the best. Nicholas has not actually been in contention for a professional title, but his invitation to play this week is not a playing of the sympathy card. The organisers say he is \"an inspiration to both disabled and able-bodied athletes\" and point to a recent round of 65, seven under par, at the Lakes course in Sydney, a frequent host of the Australian Open. Nicholas has, along the way, collected 12 consecutive World Amputee titles and his ambition is to compete in the Open championship. \"That's my dream,\" he said yesterday, \"to be a good enough player to do that. I'd just be happy to compete - which is an attitude a lot of people with disabilities have, which is different, I think, to able-bodied people.\" As for this week? \"I'd be happy to make the cut.\" Quite properly, Garcia has loftier aims. He has said that his target for 2002 is to be No1 on both sides of the Atlantic and yesterday he confirmed that. \"Don't get me wrong,\" he said. \"It will be really tough. I would have to play really well and win a major and a world golf championship event - but it is possible.\" He will need better luck this week than he had the last time he was in Australia playing in the Greg Norman International last year. He hit a ball behind a tree, took some bad advice from his playing partner - Norman himself - which led to a wrong drop, was penalised two shots and went from being the leader to joint third. He eventually lost the tournament in a play-off against Baddeley and he was not happy. But yesterday he had managed to put all that behind him and was his more usual sunny self. He greeted a reporter who arrived late for his press conference with \"Buenos noches\" and, when asked whether he had studied the rule book since his last visit, he grinned and said: \"Now I hit it on the fairway so I don't have to drop out.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
