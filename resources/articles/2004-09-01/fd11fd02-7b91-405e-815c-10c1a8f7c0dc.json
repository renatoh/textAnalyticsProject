Surrey, ravaged by retirements, defections, injuries, England calls and poor management, seemed to be falling to earth faster than America's Genesis capsule earlier this season. There was a distinct possibility of relegation. But victory over Sussex at Hove in Surrey's final game on Sunday - their fourth in five matches - pushed them up into third place. Though Rixon won nothing, he deserves the praise for producing such a remarkable transformation. The demanding and no-nonsense coach who had led New South Wales to considerable success has turned things round so thoroughly at The Oval that some Surrey members are already looking to next season. So when Rixon, a newcomer to the county game, makes a point - and he makes a strong one - he should be listened to. \"We've got to reduce the amount of cricket,\" he says. \"If you do that, a lot of things will start happening for you. You will get fresher cricketers, more innovative cricketers. \"But when you ask players to pitch up and do the same thing day in, day out, it will lead to the biggest problem you have here, which is mediocrity. I can't live with the system because it's rubbish.\" On the face of it Rixon might seem like just another county knocker, and the game has felt rather bruised in recent years. But that would be to misrepresent him. He feels the game is full of fine cricketers - something proved by the graduation of players like Andrew Strauss and Robert Key to the England side. But they have come through despite the system. \"Too much cricket, which is what we have, is absolutely the best way to produce mediocrity,\" he says. \"It breeds contempt for the game. I want to find a way to rotate Surrey players next season to keep them fresh. When we have a day off I feel it's more important to rest the players than work on their technique. Then, suddenly, we had about 10 days off before the recent Sussex game - too long if we had been going for the title. \"But we should look at ways of cutting back on the number of championship matches, even if that means treading on the toes of a few small committees. It has got to happen before anything else can move into gear. \"We could play a little more Twenty20 cricket, say eight matches each, but we should have a look at the National League. The point of county cricket is to promote players to the next level and there is no 45-overs cricket at the next level. \"I find that three up and three down in the championship is also too heavy. The team that finishes third in the Second Division has not done enough. Again, it's promoting mediocrity. Two each way is the answer.\" Rixon, 50, a neat and agile wicketkeeper batsmen who played for New South Wales and in 10 Tests for Australia, will be one of the most interested observers today when England play Australia in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy. But he will be surprised if next year's Ashes series changes the trend of modern history. \"You always have a chance when you're playing on your own dunghill but Australia are so relentless they just don't want to see anyone get close to them,\" he added. \"If they do get threatened, they can be bullies in the way they overcome sides. They create more opportunities than anyone else and on the rare occasion that they miss one they just create another. \"I can't see too many chinks in their armoury. They are just non-negotiable. The batting and fielding is outstanding. OK, the opening bowlers are picking up the odd injury and Brett Lee still has a lot to learn. \"They may have problems when bowlers like Andrew Bichel and Michael Kasprowicz, who have blended in very nicely, have to step up but that's more than 12 months away.\" Rixon has been impressed by England this summer. \"They have a proper strike bowler in Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff is an outstanding all-rounder who gives the side real balance. But the Australian batsmen will target Ashley Giles. I think he might struggle because the batsmen will target him and aim to nick him out of the attack. They will come running down the pitch to him. Australia are still in pretty good shape.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
