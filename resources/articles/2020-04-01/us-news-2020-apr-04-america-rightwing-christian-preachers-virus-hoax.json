The closely packed audience spent hours together taking in hymns and Howard-Browne\u2019s extended sermon, even as the state implemented quarantine for New Yorkers, and projections estimated that Florida\u2019s coronavirus death toll would rise into the thousands. But Howard-Browne is just one of the most prominent religious leaders on the Christian right who are endangering their flocks and the rest of America by claiming the virus is a hoax, or that it can only be defeated by supernatural means, rather than solid healthcare policy. A sometime guest on Infowars and at the White House; a multi-level marketing kingpin who has alleged that Hollywood celebrities sacrifice children and that New Zealand\u2019s Christchurch mosque attack was a so-called false flag event; Howard-Browne described Covid-19 as a \u201cphantom plague\u201d on 15 March. In the same sermon, he claimed the public health response to the virus was part of a plot involving the Rockefeller Foundation and World Health Organization, whose goals were forced vaccinations and mass murder. Howard-Browne has repeatedly refused to call off services in the interests of social distancing. In fact, in recent weeks he has insisted that his congregants embrace and shake hands, exhorting them that they were \u201crevivalists, not pansies\u201d. On Monday, he was finally arrested for violating Florida\u2019s rules on social distancing. There are other American religious leaders and preachers who are in equally deep denial about the potentially deadly virus which will almost certainly infect a significant proportion of evangelicals, along with all other Americans. Roy Moore, a pastor, former Alabama supreme court judge and failed Trump-backed Alabama Senate candidate who lost amid allegations of sexual misconduct with underage girls, told Facebook followers he would write a letter to his fellow pastors on what he called their \u201cduty to continue church assemblies, even in the midst of these trying times\u201d. Moore added: \u201cOur faith requires it, our duty demands it, and no law or government can prohibit it.\u201d Kenneth Copeland, a Texas-based \u201cprosperity gospel\u201d preacher who once defended his ownership of three private jets on the grounds that commercial flights would require him to \u201cget in a long tube with a bunch of demons\u201d, told viewers of his Victory Channel in early March that coronavirus was a \u201cweak\u201d strain of the flu, and that fearing the pandemic was a sin. \u201cFear is a spiritual force. Fear is not OK. It is sin. It is a magnet for sickness and disease \u2026 You are giving the devil a pathway to your body,\u201d Copeland said. He also criticized pastors who had suspended in-person services and moved to online streaming. Self-described prophet Lance Walnau wrote in a blogpost that \u201cthis virus will touch just a fraction of the population\u201d, adding that it was less dangerous than seasonal flu. He turned to conspiracy theory for an explanation of the public health response and associated media coverage. \u201cThe left wants the economy distressed because crisis improves their chances of taking office,\u201d Walnau wrote. He then counseled readers to ignore the information being published by media outlets. \u201cThere is a spirit on media that will exaggerate this virus so badly that you will need to insulate your head in order to keep yourself free from paranoia,\u201d Walnau wrote. In the rightwing Catholic-aligned religious journal First Things, meanwhile, editor RR Reno castigated the widespread closure of Catholic churches and the suspension of public masses in Rome. Reno wrote: \u201cIt is imperative that Christian leaders not succumb to the contagious panic, which is a weapon of the enemy to enslave us to our fears.\u201d From Montana, Chuck Baldwin \u2013 a pastor, former politician and purveyor of conspiracy theories about \u201cZionist influence\u201d in the media \u2013 left the question of whether the virus was a hoax open in an online sermon. But he added: \u201cIf it\u2019s not a hoax, the virus is being used as a completely exaggerated, super-hyped, super-inflated psychological ops campaign against the American people \u2013 a coordinated full-court press of intimidation and fear-mongering by government, the mass media and the CDC.\u201d That message was dutifully amplified by the Idaho state representative Heather Scott on her Facebook page. Others on the Christian right acknowledge the reality of the virus, but proffer supernatural causes or remedies. In a blogpost last week, Ralph Drollinger, who has led Bible study for Trump cabinet members, suggested the virus was an instrument of divine judgment, and appeared to blame LGBTQ people. Drollinger later claimed that this was a misinterpretation. Another would-be prophet, Jeremiah Johnson, claimed last week to have had a prophetic dream in which God had spoken to him. In a baseball stadium where Trump, at bat, outwitted a demonic pitcher, Johnson said God had told him: \u201cThe enemy has intended to strike out Donald Trump at a very critical hour in history. But behold, supernatural help is on the way, for I will slow down the advancement of the enemy and allow him to knock this out of the park.\u201d Andr\u00e9 Gagne, an associate professor of theological studies at Concordia University, and a researcher of the Christian right, recently published on the phenomenon of coronavirus denialism among evangelicals. Asked why evangelical leaders are committed to taking such a risk in denying the reality of the infection, or even assisting its spread, Gagne said it was rooted in their theology. \u201cMany of these preachers believe Christians shouldn\u2019t be controlled by a \u2018spirit of fear\u2019,\u201d Gagne said. \u201cThey often quote biblical texts which promise God\u2019s healing and protection to those who have faith. They are confident that God is in control; that this is part of his overall plan before a great end-times spiritual revival.\u201d He said: \u201cThere are those who also understand this in terms of \u2018spiritual warfare\u2019, and that Jesus gave Christians authority over every demon and sickness. And if a Christian dies, no worries: he or she will \u2018be with the Lord\u2019.\u201d Meanwhile, even where they disagree about the virus, religious leaders have found common ground on one subject: the importance of fundraising. While Trump\u2019s spiritual adviser Paula White-Cain has now recommended social distancing to her audience, she and Kenneth Copeland both encouraged their listeners to keep the donations rolling into their churches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
