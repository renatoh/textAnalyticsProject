The archive contains private correspondence between the former poet laureate and Baskin whose collaboration began in 1958, when Hughes accepted a teaching post in Massachusets, and lasted until Hughes's death in 1998. Baskin, who died in 2000, was a sculptor, illustrator and printer who shared Hughes's interest in the themes of mortality and the human condition. He founded the Gehenna Press in 1942 which became renowned for its high quality limited edition illustrated works. Baskin and Hughes's best-known collaboration was on the Crow poems. As Hughes explained in an article written in 1985, \"Crow grew out of an invitation by Leonard Baskin to make a book with him simply about crows. He wanted an occasion to add more crows to all the crows that flock through his sculpture, drawings, and engravings in their various transformations.\" Dr Chris Fletcher, curator of literary manuscripts at the British Library, said \"Impetus for their work came from both sides of the partnership. Their letters show that Baskin regularly sent Hughes sketches or drawings; Hughes would respond by devising poems, inspiring Baskin to create still more drawings. \"This mutually beneficial partnership is particularly reflected in their work on Hughes' Crow, generally considered one of the most significant of Hughes' poem sequences. Hughes recognised the central importance of Baskin's illustrations to his own work declaring 'Crow drawings are stupendous - my poor text wilts'.\" The archive also contains handwritten and typescript copies of poems with numerous annotations, preparatory materials including drawings, galley proofs, typescripts and manuscripts for Crow, Cave Birds, Season Songs, Flowers and Insects and The Hanged Man and the Dragonfly. The Baskin-Hughes collection joins the British Library's collection of literary manuscripts by Hughes and Sylvia Plath, and Baskin's library of Ted Hughes's published poetry, most volumes of which include extended personal dedications."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
