It all begins late on Wednesday, starting at midnight. THE OPENING It is a Law of cricket that you have to watch the first ball of the Ashes, even if it means jolting yourself awake at 11.58pm. Seven years ago Steve Harmison bowled to slip at the Gabba; 12 years before that Michael Slater cut Phil DeFreitas for four.
