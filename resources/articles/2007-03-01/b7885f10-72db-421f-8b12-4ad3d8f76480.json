It could turn out to be the average first-innings score of this competition, give or take a few totals of 350-plus against the minnows. \"Have you got any predictions to go with Rob's Naved for highest wicket taker?\" chuckles Sam Silverwood-Cope, wallowing in Smyth's misery with faultless hindsight. \"Maybe Inzamam and Leverock to run the most singles?\" I'll give you a neck-on-the-block tip, Copers: Pakistan to win this game by five wickets. Post-preamble Smyth has disappeared to do my shopping for me, which is nice of him. I've asked for a can of coke to keep me going, but doubtless he'll turn up with a bucketful of Relentless and a brown envelope poking out of his back pocket. Less importantly, how will Pakistan's openers play this? They could finish off the game with an early spurt, but two quick wickets and West Indies will get a chance to attack Pakistan's stellar middle order with the new ball. Questions, questions. Post-etc I'll get my excuses in early. I returned from a 10-day trip to Hong Kong yesterday, which means my body is currently operating as if it's 2.45am. If I fall asleep mid-innings, Smyth will step in. Anyway, the players are out in the middle and that usually means they're about to play some cricket. WICKET! Imran Nazir c Ramdin b Powell 6 (6-1) Six and out! After upper-cutting the second ball of the innings over the ropes at backward point, Imran is undone by a beauty next ball that leaves him as he attempts to drive. What a start by West Indies. Game - dare I say it - on! 1st over: Pakistan 10-1 (Mohammad Hafeez 0, Younis Khan 4) I believe that's what's known as a hectic start. Younis Khan dabs his first ball to fine third man for four and is then beaten by another pearler. A classic mixture of beauties and beasts from Powell. At this rate I'll be out of here by about 8.15... 2nd over: Pakistan 10-1 (Mohammad Hafeez 0, Younis Khan 4) Jerome Taylor, who I reckon is going to have a very handy World Cup, opens the bowling from the other end on his home island and immediately beats Mohammad Hafeez, who spent the first over watching the school-playground mayhem unfold from the non-striker's end. It's been a pretty decent Sabina Park strip, this. That's why I reckon the Windies' total is on the short side. But that was a good over from Taylor, he of the Champions Trophy hat-trick against Australia. A maiden. \"I've got a tip for you,\" says Jonathan Wood. \"Windies are going to drive through the heart of the Pakistani batting to leave them reeling at 21-4. Fact. And make yourself useful, Boothy. Anyone got any tips for Paris joints showing the cricket? And I'd prefer to avoid the Beaver on Ile St.Louis (no sniggering at the back) - Canadians and cricket do not mix.\" 3rd over: Pakistan 10-1 (Mohammad Hafeez 0, Younis Khan 4) Another maiden, this time from Powell to Younis Khan. Honestly, it's as if the madness of the first over is a distant memory. \"So any tales of debauchery from Hong Kong to report to make the overs pass a bit quicker?\" wonders the ungrateful Ronan Hayes. \"Did you get to sit in the Dentist's Chair? I hear Relentless does very bad things to your teeth.\" I was visiting my girlfriend, Ronan, which meant I had to give the Philippino lady-boys a miss. WICKET! Younis Khan c Ramdin b Taylor 9 (17-2) Well, well. Younis Khan tries to pull a wide one outside off-stump but gets a slight top edge through to the keeper. What on earth was he doing even looking at that ball, let alone trying to smash it into Trinidad? The crowd go mad and West Indies are beginning to dream. 5th over: Pakistan 21-2 (Mohammad Hafeez 5, Mohammad Yousuf 0) Lovely, tension-easing shot from Hafeez, who on-drives Powell for four and momentarily silences the locals. It's nervy stuff out there. And I should know: I'm sitting in Farringdon. \"Not only did I miss the start of the first innings (unavoidably) but now I've missed the beginning again, and probably the most exciting moment of the day so far,\" moans Clare Davies. \"And what was I doing? Pissing around trying to set up the tape for Life on Mars, cos it was set for 9pm until a quick check revealed that the BBC in their wisdom have changed the schedules. Again. I despair, I truly do.\" 6th over: Pakistan 25-2 (Mohammad Hafeez 5, Mohammad Yousuf 4) Pakistan need one of Yousuf's specials here: a Steve Waugh 120 not out would do the job nicely. There's two of them, timed neatly off the back foot through the covers with the ease of Smyth downing a can of you-know-what. The next ball brings two to midwicket. Four down, 116 to go. \"Jonathon Wood should set course for The Bowler in the 8th or the Cricketers near la Madeleine,\" says Martin Dixon as we start yet another game of Recommend The Pub In A Foreign City. \"The former had the cricket on when I walked past just now. The latter, barring unforeseen closure, will always show it. Both will sell Paris' version of Relentless, the ominously titled Dark Dog.\" You heard it here second. 7th over: Pakistan 31-2 (Mohammad Hafeez 9, Mohammad Yousuf 4) What a shot from Hafeez, who eases a Powell half-volley to the one-side of the stumps: four runs of purest gold. Powell responds by beating a grope outside off. Those two balls sum up this game so far: ebb followed swiftly by flow. It could be a corker. \"Why, I wonder, Lawrence, do you OBO types feel you must share details of your love lives with us?\" asksClare Davies. \"Is it simply to make those of us who don't currently have one, feel even sadder and more lonely?\" Yes. 8th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Mohammad Hafeez 9, Mohammad Yousuf 6) West Indies are still on top here, and another wicket would make them strong favourites. \"You do realise that I'm currently finishing a project at uni and now I want to write relentless every third word,\" says Peter Burgess, who obviously thinks everyone knows exactly what he is up to. \"Come to think of it I'll probably need some later.\" 9th over: Pakistan 35-2 (Mohammad Hafeez 10, Mohammad Yousuf 8) Dwayne Smith dives superbly at backward point to cut off what would have been four to Yousuf, who has to content himself next ball with a single to mid-on to keep the strike. Nothing doing right nowm, except for Smyth chuckling away next to me. \"Sorry to hear about Clare Davies's love life,\" says Rachel. \"But what time is Life on Mars? The BBC website still says 9pm.\" Gah. 10th over: Pakistan 37-2 (Mohammad Hafeez 10, Mohammad Yousuf 10) I reckon Pakistan need to be in a position here where they need no more than 80 off the last 10 overs. But there's a long way to go before they can begin to think about victory. Yousuf is gifted two runs through mid-off thanks to a lazy piece of fielding from a player who shall remain nameless. Because I didn't recognise him. Still, there were just two runs off that Taylor over. Advantage Windies. WICKET! Mohammad Hafeez c Lara b Powell 11 (39-3) If I had played that shot on the village green, I would have hung my head in shame and left via the back entrance, never to return. It was a very average ball from Powell, but Hafeez drag-drove it straight to Brian Lara at mid-on, who took the catch above his head. A lamentable shot, and Pakistan are two wickets away from oblivion. I do worry about some of our readers. Here's Phil Sawyer. \"Is it worrying that I can do nothing better to do than email the OBO, even though I'm at home and listening to the cricket on the radio anyway?\" he asks, answering his own question in the process. \"Your jetsetting lifestyle puts me to shame, but I have to do something to fill in the gaps until the next episode of Heroes (home alone AND a superhero fan - I'm really selling myself here).\" Clare Davies is single, Phil. 11th over: Pakistan 40-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 11, Inzamam-ul-Haq 1) \"This is where the game hinges,\" says Ian Bishop on Sky and he's dead right. 12th over: Pakistan 42-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 11, Inzamam-ul-Haq 2) Shoaib Malik is next man in, followed by Kamran Akmal, but then we're into Rana Naved and the tail. Yousuf and Inzamam are going to have to add at least 100 to get Pakistan back into the game. But they won't find life easy against Corey Collymore, who has to be one of the unluckiest bowlers in world cricket. At least he was when England toured the Caribbean three years ago: think a less scowling Javagal Srinath. After opening with a marginal leg-side wide, he goes up for a big shout against Inzamam, but Billy Bowden correctly rules that the ball struck Inzy outside the line of off. \"Tell Rachel that Life on Mars is probably on at 9pm in England,\" says Clare Davies, \"and that there'll probably be that announcement before hand saying \"and now viewers in Scotland have their own programme\". We're definitely not getting it before 10.30 - and no sniggering at that after my previous complaint.\" Trust CD to plunge the conversation into the realms of innuendo and muck. 13th over: Pakistan 43-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 11, Inzamam-ul-Haq 3) Powell continues to Inzamam, who tucks him easily off his pads and lumbers through for a single with apparent reluctance. Powell then beats Yousuf outside off with a widish delivery that drew an unusually tentative prod from the batsman. Pakistan have looked out of sorts with the bat so far. It's definitely been a wrong-side-of-bed performance from them. One off the over. \"Given that no universities can afford to run chemistry etc departments and maths is too hard, shouldn't most students be able to do their project on the cultural significance of World Cup OBOing?\" suggests Gary Naylor. \"Everyone's doing Media Studies now aren't they?\" 14th over: Pakistan 43-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 11, Inzamam-ul-Haq 3) It's a battle of the beards right now: Inzamam and Yousuf out in the middle and Collymore with the ball. All we need now is for Fidel Castro to take a screamer at backward point and Santa Claus to come on with the mid-innings drinks. I blame the jetlag. A maiden. \"Does anyone know where to watch in the St Louis, MO area?\" wonders an insanely optimistic Paul Frazer, lapsing alarmingly into American-speak. \"I called my local sports pub and they have no idea. I probably a better chance of finding a Jimmy Cricket cd.\" 15th over: Pakistan 44-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 12, Inzamam-ul-Haq 3) This is really good tight stuff from West Indies, somewhere between a noose and a vice. Powell concedes a single to Yousuf, who works him off his hip to midwicket, but Inzamam can barely get the ball off the square. And he looks even less in the mood for a quick single than usual. One off the over. Again. And the run-rate has dropped below three an over. Tom van der Gucht must be jetlagged as well. \"As a galloping (and desperate for the cash) supply teacher I have to accept every job offered my way,\" he begins, a propos of nothing at all. \"Tomorrow I'm baking with a nursery class. I'm something of a novice when it comes to baking but my culinary style involves a certain amount of pizzazz. Anyhow, I'm caught between making normal buns and trying to ice in cricket ball stitches in honour of the world cup (to please myself) or to try and make butterfly buns which look like flies (chocolate ones with smarties for eyes) as they have been reading an Eric Carle book about a spider that catches a fly...\" Nurse! 16th over: Pakistan 44-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 12, Inzamam-ul-Haq 3) You can never write Pakistan off when these two are at the crease, but at the moment they have completely dried up. That's a maiden to Collymore and Pakistan have scored 19 runs off the last 10 overs. 17th over: Pakistan 52-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 12, Inzamam-ul-Haq 11) Inzamam breaks the shackles as only Inzamam can, first with a pull for four off Powell, then with a cover-driven boundary next ball. Inzy would have been rubbish at sleeping lions. He'd lie there doing nothing for five minutes before roaring inexplicably into life. \"I live across the road from Jimmy Cricket in Rochdale,\" claims Ged Ashton. \"I'd be happy to post him a copy of Jimmy's latest release. After all what's better than sitting back and listening to his cutting edge \"Oirish\" banter?\" Does he throw stones at your window last thing at night or something? 18th over: Pakistan 57-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 17, Inzamam-ul-Haq 11) Collymore continues after leaking all of two runs in his first three overs. He really is one of the world's most under-rated bowlers. And he was heading for another maiden there until Yousuf latched onto a rare half-volley and collected four through the covers. That's boundaries now for both batsmen in the last two overs. Has the beast stirred? (And I'm not talking about Smyth, who is currently playing Stick Cricket.) 19th over: Pakistan 64-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 19, Inzamam-ul-Haq 16) Powell is into the last over of an impressive spell (9-1-35-2), but Inzamam is starting to find his rhythm and rocks onto the back foot to carve a loose ball to the cover fence. Glorious, and it prompts Lara to remove his only slip. West Indies have to be careful not to go on the defensive too early: one more quick wicket and the game is almost theirs. 20th over: Pakistan 64-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 19, Inzamam-ul-Haq 16) Collymore slots back into his parsimonious ways after being hit for four in his last over by Yousuf. That's another maiden: his third in five overs as the crowd shows its appreciation. \"Clare Davies may be single,\" says Phil Sawyer, \"but she claims she knows there are no OBO readers within 300 miles of her (see Smyth's commentary). Does she have some sort of OBO reader detecting technology? What if it should fall into the wrong hands? I have visions of being hunted down by armed to the teeth BBC OBO writers and subjected to their commentary.\" Now, now, Phil. 21st over: Pakistan 66-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 20, Inzamam-ul-Haq 17) On comes Dwayne Smith, who bowls the kind of 75mph dibbly-dobblers that Geoff Boycott's mum is forever hitting for six with her rolling pin. Inzamam clearly views Smith's bowling in the same light and tries to pull his first ball into downtown Kingston. But he's too early on the shot and the ball thuds into his ample thigh. Just two singles off the over and the pressure remains on Pakistan. \"Lawrence,\" begins Clare Davies accurately. \"It's only on OBO that I'm ever accused of innuendo or muck (well, almost). All I can say is that if the cleanliness of minds is being called into question, well...\" Well what? Are you saying Smyth has a dirty mind? 22nd over: Pakistan 71-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 23, Inzamam-ul-Haq 19) Who will crack first? The answer is not obvious in that Collymore over as the required run-rate drifts almost unnoticed above a run a ball. But there were five singles in that over, which is the kind of milking Pakistan will need to apply to the West Indian udder/attack if they are to stay in the hunt. 23rd over: Pakistan 74-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 25, Inzamam-ul-Haq 20) If Pakistan score at five an over for the next 15 without losing a wicket, they will be in a decent position to launch an assault. But it's a big if right now as Smith continues with his hit-me-please dobbers and there are only three singles off the over. 24th over: Pakistan 80-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 26, Inzamam-ul-Haq 25) Inzamam shows intent by gallumphing down the crease to Collymore and whipping him over midwicket for his fourth boundary. A classy shot and proof, if it were needed, that Pakistan are in this game while these two are at the crease. But Inzy almost throws it away by hurling the kitchen sink and other assorted items at a wide one and missing. \"I always thought that the first part of Sleeping Lions involved running around really fast doing lots of physical exercise,\" says Clare Davies, who clearly played some very strange games in her childhood. \"Would rule Inzy out even before the lying down bit, I'd have thought.\" 25th over: Pakistan 82-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 27, Inzamam-ul-Haq 26) Michael Holding believes the pitch is starting to get a little slower, and if the mediocre former West Indies medium-pacer says it, it's good enough for me. That means Chris Gayle should come into play in the next 10 minutes or so. Just two singles off Smith's over. \"Lawrence, tell Phil that I may have exaggerated for effect,\" says Clare Davies, who needs to get out more. \"I do vaguely remember an OBOer at some point in the Ashes claiming to live in Aberdeen. Considerably closer than 300 miles - but still a safely long drive away!\" Hang on. A few overs ago you were moaning about being single! 26th over: Pakistan 86-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 29, Inzamam-ul-Haq 28) Enter Dwayne Bravo, one of the most talented young cricketers in the Caribbean, not that there's a lot of competition. I'd probably fit into that category right now. If I was a) West Indian and b) in the Caribbean. Four singles off the over and this game is bubbling under nicely. \"I think I've cracked it,\" says Dominic Howden the reason Clare thinks there are no OBOers within 300 miles of her is that she's actually winterovering at McMurdo sound, in the Antarctic. Or do some of us already know where she is?\" 27th over: Pakistan 92-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 33, Inzamam-ul-Haq 30) Lara has two medium-pacers on right now, which suggests he has read the pitch and agreed with Holding's assessment: slow, getting slower. But Inzamam brings up 96-ball 50 stand with a nudge for one to third man. It's been slow but crucial, and there's two more with a neat cover-drive by Yousuf off Smith. Six off the over and Pakistan are starting to milk without too many problems. 28th over: Pakistan 97-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 36, Inzamam-ul-Haq 32) This game is now back in the balance, having been in the purple territory marked \"Windies\" until about half an hour ago. There are few better batsmen in world cricket at working the ball around and keeping the scoreboard ticking over. Are England watching? Because if they want to get anywhere in this competition, this is the kind of approach they are going to have to master at some stage. Five off Bravo's over. WICKET! Mohammad Yousuf c Ramdin b Smith 37 (99-4) From nowhere - and with embarrassing timing, given what I wrote in the last over - Yousuf is undone by a bit of bounce and is caught behind as he tries to force a ball he should have left alone. He looked strangley skittish in that over. Why? Pakistan were doing it so well. The game swings again. 30th over: Pakistan 105-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 34, Shoaib Malik 5) Pakistan have to rebuild now with only these two standing between West Indies and the lower order. Not for the first time, Inzamam is going to have to do a lot of the work himself, although Shoaib is more than handy. But the required rate is approaching seven and the pitch is getting no easier to bat on. And as I write that, Malik flat-bats a wide Bravo long-hop through the covers for four. \"Is the reason CD knows she's the only OBOer in 300miles of her simply that she knows she is the one using Scotland's internet connection and so no one else can get on?\" wonders Toby Messinger. 31st over: Pakistan 108-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 35, Shoaib Malik 7) So, Pakistan need 137 off the last 20. It's doable, but it will need these two plus Kamran Akmal to score at least 100 of them. Three off the over. \"Why on earth would you think I'd suggest Smyth had a filthy mind?\" says Davies. \"You're the one who works with him!\" Is there no stopping this woman? 32nd over: Pakistan 111-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 36, Shoaib Malik 9) \"This could be a good finish actually,\" says Smyth, who has only just woken up to the possibility. Bravo bowls well in that over, mixing it up like a bag of allsorts and inviting the Pakistanis to come and get him. They do their best, but only to the tune of three singles, when what they need is seven and a bit. WICKET! Inzamam-ul-Haq lbw b Smith 36 (116-5) A HUGE wicket, which I am cleverly emphasising with the use of capital letters. My first instinct was that there were two noises there, and Inzamam is walking off incredibly slowly, but then he never exactly runs off. Whether or not Simon Taufel got it right or wrong, that could be game over. \"My fantasy World Cup rules allow one player per team, and in today's match I had Lara and Yousuf,\" says Chris Henderson in Cleveland, Ohio. \"In an interesting coincidence both finished on 37, and if you've seen Clerks as many times as I have you might understand why I'm amused by that. Or perhaps I've just wasted 10 seconds of your life, for which I'm sorry.\" I'm saying nothing. WICKET! Kamran Akmal c Bravo b Smith 0 (116-6) The Windies are on fire! Kamran Akmal fails to get over a square-drive first ball and is superbly caught by a diving Bravo at backward point. Surely it's game over now! 33rd over: Pakistan 116-6 (Shoaib Malik 14, Rana Naved 0) Smith's hat-trick ball is a disappointingly tame slow full-toss, but the ground is buzzing now and the hosts are surely going to begin the World Cup with a win. 34th over: Pakistan 119-6 (Shoaib Malik 16, Rana Naved 1) Pakistan will look back at this game and wonder what their top order were playing at. Younis Khan tried to pull a ball that was nowhere near him, Mohammad Hafeez lifted tamely to mid-on, and Mohammad Yousuf undid all his diligence with an unworthy poke. It was all so shoddy - almost as shoddy, in fact, as the failure to show a replay of Inzamam's lbw decision. I'm still none the wiser as to whether he got an inside edge. Bravo mixes it up again in that over, which costs only three. 35th over: Pakistan 124-6 (Shoaib Malik 19, Rana Naved 3) Lara's decision to stick with his two medium-pacers has paid off majestically here, particularly in the case of Smith. Pakistan - poised precariously between the need to score runs and conserve wickets - can manage only five singles in that Smith over. \"What does it say that Clare Davies regards the nearest OBO reader as a \"safely long drive away\"?\" asks her potential suitor Phil Sawyer. She's just being coy, Phil. 36th over: Pakistan 127-6 (Shoaib Malik 21, Rana Naved 4) Back comes Jerome Taylor in place of Bravo (5-0-21-0) and Naved is almost run out as the bowler collects the ball in his followthrough and aims at the non-striker's end. He misses, but Naved was home anyway. Pakistan are just hoping and praying here, which pretty well sums up their efforts with the bat so far. Still, no need to peak too early, as I might have written somewhere else today. \"Re Chris Henderson,\" says Jos Roberts. \"If he had seen Clerks as many times as I have he would know it's 27, not 37. Sadly, that's probably going to be England's top score on Friday.\" You've got to love the eternal optimism of the England Cricket Fan. 37th over: Pakistan 129-6 (Shoaib Malik 22, Rana Naved 5) Smith goes in search of his fourth wicket and goes up for an optimistic shout for lbw against Naved, but - rightly - Taufel is having none of it. Just two off the over and Pakistan's hopes are dwindling by the delivery. \"There goes the five-wicket prediction,\" says Charlie Easton. \"Do betfair have a 'get out of jail' clause about receiving rubbish tips from overly tired e-pundits?\" Please tell me you didn't risk your hard-earned cash on my witterings. Eh? Oh. 38th over: Pakistan 131-6 (Shoaib Malik 23, Rana Naved 6) Taylor is having a good day too. His first six overs cost only 16, and West Indies's parsimony has been a heartening feature of this opening match. That's seven overs for 18 now. 39th over: Pakistan 137-6 (Shoaib Malik 25, Rana Naved 10) Smith is generally regarded as a batting all-rounder, but - as Smyth keeps reminding me - his ODI average with the bat is 15. And today he has taken three key wickets for next to nothing. This is the last over of a man-of-the-match-winning spell and he's even getting a bit of reverse to rub it in. Smith finishes with figures of 10-0-36-3 and Pakistan need 105 off 11 overs. Unlikely springs to mind. 40th over: Pakistan 143-6 (Shoaib Malik 30, Rana Naved 11) Shoaib isn't going down without a fight, no by Jiminy, as he swings Taylor for four over midwicket. But it looks like being a futile gesture and the Pakistan balcony currently resembles a morgue without the exuberance. \"If I was still in South London, I'd no doubt be issuing wild invitations for all those inclined to come round for a World Cup Party Fest - for all 6 weeks,\" says Clare Davies. \"You're all much safer that I'm far away!\" Not for the first time - and almost certainly not for the last - the mind boggles. WICKET! Rana Naved b Bravo 11 (144-7) Naved aims a sickening hoick at Bravo and gets a thick inside edge onto off and middle. 41st over: Pakistan 144-7 (Shoaib Malik 31, Rao Iftikhar 0) It's a matter of time now and West Indies can rest easy in the knowledge that - barring upsets - they will take two points with them into the Super Eights stage. A great over from Bravo. 42nd over: Pakistan 153-7 (Shoaib Malik 39, Rao Iftikhar 1) \"This is the kind of West Indies team that can win the World Cup,\" says Tony Cozier, which might be pushing it. But they have bowled brilliantly as a pack: accurate, disciplined, inventive. And, as Cozier, is pointing out, it has been their youngsters who have scored the runs and taken the wickets: Marlon Samuels, Dwayne Smith, Daren Powell. Malik smears Taylor over deep midwicket for six, but he'll need roughly two of those an over for the rest of the match if Pakistan are going to escape here. 43rd over: Pakistan 165-7 (Shoaib Malik 49, Rao Iftikhar 2) Malik is a determined cricketer and he stands-and-delivers the first ball of that Bravo over down the ground for four. The not-particularly-original money says he's got no chance, but he then picks up four more with a cracking drive that Chris Gayle very nearly cuts off at wide long-on. That's 21 off the last two overs. Malik wants to do this by himself! Pakistan need 78 off seven overs. 44th over: Pakistan 170-7 (Shoaib Malik 52, Rao Iftikhar 4) There's Shoaib's fifty and it's taken him just 41 balls. A great effort, but almost certainly in vain as Taylor completes figures of 10-1-38-1. \"Clare Davies,\" begins Nick Denny, maintaining the theme of the evening, \"should be grateful that presumably no OBO-ers have access to astronaut nappies, given the recent news from here in God Bless the USA!\" 45th over: Pakistan 175-7 (Shoaib Malik 54, Rao Iftikhar 7) Pakistan need 72 off six overs, and Malik is going to have to get about 67 of them himself. He manages a single down the ground off the second ball of Bravo's over, but the first four deliveries yield only two singles and the ask drifts into the realms of the virtually impossible. Five off the over is no way near enough. 46th over: Pakistan 184-7 (Shoaib Malik 61, Rao Iftikhar 9) Back comes Corey Collymore, whose opening spell of 7-3-18-0 was almost religious in its immaculateness. He could become an increasingly important figure as the tournament progresses. A loose one outside leg-stump is helped to fine leg for four by the admirable Malik, but the equation is 58 off 24 balls, which is the stuff of fantasy. WICKET! Rao Iftikhar c Lara b Bravo 11 (187-8) Iftikhar turns a low, slow full-toss into a wicket-taking delivery by toe-ending a drive to mid-off, where Lara reaches above his head to take a simple catch. Game - almost - over. \"I have no idea what Nick Denny is on about,\" says Clare Davies. \"Does anyone else?\" WICKET! Umar Gul 0 (187-9) That's brilliant by Bravo, who sticks out his left hand to intercept a firm push from Umar Gul: two balls, two full-tosses, two wickets and the end is nigh. WICKET! Shoaib Malik c Chanderpaul b Collymore 62 (187) That's it! West Indies have beaten Pakistan by 54 runs, with the coup de grace applied by the excellent Collymore. Malik tried to hit him into kingdom come but succeeded only in picking out Shiv Chanderpaul at long-off. It's been a comprehensive win by a very disciplined West Indies side. It's too early to say, of course, but if they keep playing like this, they will be in the mix for a semi-final spot. Thanks very much and see you for tomorrow's cliff-hanger between Australia and Scotland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
