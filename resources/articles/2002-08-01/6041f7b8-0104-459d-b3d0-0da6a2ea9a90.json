Ferguson revealed he had persuaded United's board to release more funds for another high-profile signing, but flatly denied making a second approach for Di Canio, having failed to prise him away from Upton Park last season. Despite mounting speculation and the widespread knowledge that Di Canio is eager to move to Old Trafford, the player's representatives also stated there had been no contact with the deposed champions. Ferguson may yet go back for Di Canio if he is unsuccessful elsewhere, and the United manager is also monitoring whether Chelsea's financial position could have implications for the availability of Jimmy Hasselbaink or Eidur Gudjohnsen. Lazio, meanwhile, have made it clear that Hernan Crespo is available, but the Italian club would prefer a player-plus-cash exchange with Juan Sebastian Veron. Ferguson wants to keep the Argentinian. What is certain is that United will have to act swiftly if they are to bring in a new player before Wednesday's transfer deadline for their two-leg Champions League qualifier against either NK Zagreb of Croatia or Hungary's Zalaegerszegi later this month. \"There's not a lot of time, but beyond that the next deadline for the competition proper is August 31,\" said Ferguson. \"We would like to have four strikers again because we've always worked on that basis.\" The Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier has admitted he will have to rest his World Cup players in an attempt to avoid them suffering \"mental exhaustion\" after their summer spent in Korea and Japan. Houllier's striker Michael Owen is likely to play only a bit-part in the opening match of the Madrid tournament this evening against Real Madrid, with his England team-mate Steven Gerrard not expected to feature until Sunday's second match. \u00b7 Manchester United have appointed the Brazilian Francisco Filho as their new Under-17 coach. Filho has spent the past 29 years at the French football academy in Clarefontaine. \"To have someone of Francisco's calibre here is fantastic,\" said United's chief executive Peter Kenyon. \"The youth team is an integral part of the club if we are to continue developing the football of the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
