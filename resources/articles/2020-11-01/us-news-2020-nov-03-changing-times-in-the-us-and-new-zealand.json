Sadly, the words of academics have little effect on the ground. In 1965 David P Calleo wrote: \u201cIn many countries the political function has shifted from parliaments to presidents and prime ministers. Strong men, using the power of mass communication to draw strength from the people, have taken over the tasks of rule. It is one of the paradoxes of modern politics that a kind of elected monarchy seems the typical form of government for a large-scale democracy. It is the president who represents the people and parliament the elite.

When the constitution was drafted, many voters living far from the centre of government had difficulty getting enough information to make a reasoned choice, and it made sense to delegate someone to go and find out. That is no longer true, and it is time to enact an amendment to abolish the electoral college, and elect the president by a simple majority of the aggregated votes of all citizens. Herbert Munk Coventry \u2022 Two countries are preoccupied with hotly contested national elections this week. One is to decide between a thug and an old man for president and the other, New Zealand, whether to have a parrot, a penguin or a flightless bird as its bird of the year (Voting opens in New Zealand\u2019s beloved Bird of the Year competition, 2 November). I\u2019m sure there is a moral here, but cannot think what it is. Peter Waterson Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire \u2022 Some years ago, on arrival at Auckland airport, passengers were (jokingly) advised to put their clocks back 20 years.
