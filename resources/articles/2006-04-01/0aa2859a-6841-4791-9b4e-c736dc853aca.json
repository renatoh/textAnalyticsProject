Spartacus (1968), depicts an unsuccessful uprising of Thracian gladiators against imperial Rome, and is crammed with the sort of shock-sequences which normally fall outside ballet's remit. So you get a corps of sword-wielding legionaries hacking at the air as their leader, the kiss-curled Crassus (Vladimir Neporozhny), whirls sneeringly in their midst. You get the triumphant dance of Crassus's lover Aegina (Maria Allash), goose-stepping and Nazi-saluting across the stage with a ruby twinkling at each nipple. And you get the ballet's most famous image, the dying body of Spartacus lifted aloft on a thicket of Roman spears. A creation of almost abstract heroism, Spartacus (Dmitri Belogolovtsev), is loved by Phrygia (Anna Antonicheva), who is either coiling mink-like around his mighty thighs or being hoisted aloft, lips parted in revolutionary fervour, on his muscled sword-arm. Crassus and Aegina's duets, by contrast, are vulgar and crutchy; theirs is a more complex interdependency. After being defeated in combat by Spartacus, Crassus is reduced to impotent pacing around his lover's bedchamber, blind to her snaky pirouettes. Aegina knows her man, though, and the slow, suggestive unsheathing of a sword soon helps him get his groove back. Spartacus is an important ballet, but it's shrunk over the years. As an instrument of Soviet propaganda, it used to have a kind of appalling power. This is not because the great Soviet dancers all believed in communism; many didn't. But they believed in the privilege of their calling, and in the moral power of their art. Now it's just showbusiness, and sovietism's signature ballet is an echoing hulk, an Ozymandias statue in the sand, telling a stranger and more melancholy story than its creator ever intended. Kenneth MacMillan's 1976 Requiem contains curious parallels to Spartacus. Both stress ideas of ascent and verticality, with protagonists repeatedly borne aloft or floated on a sea of hands. Both have a sense of offertory, in which human love is sublimated to a great abstraction: freedom in the one case, salvation in the other. The difference is that you watch Requiem without a sense of ironic distance. The dancers' belief in the work is absolute and is underpinned by a transcendent principal performance by Darcey Bussell. Bussell is the strangest of dancers. There are times when she's barely there - at a recent gala performance of the Swan Lake Act II adagio she might have been wondering what colour to do the spare bedroom - and there are times when the beauty and profundity of her dancing carries all before it, imprinting itself on your memory forever. Requiem came at the end of an evening which began with Christopher Wheeldon's Polyphonia. Although plotless, the piece's shifting moods and currents suggest relationships. Leanne Benjamin and Martin Harvey, in particular, are mesmerising, she alternately binding to him like ivy and extending into meditative hyperextension. Alina Cojocaru is compelling too, cutting the air with razor-slash arabesques and drawing the stage-space to herself with coolly engineered turns. Polyphonia isn't a perfect piece, and at times the dancers' convolutions look a little forced. But the lightness of touch with which Wheeldon flickers between the sexy, the sad and the inconsequential is a joy. The evening's premiere was Castle Nowhere, by Matjash Mrozewski, and was just too tightly encrypted to convey meaning. Who are this couple in evening dress (Zenaida Yanowsky and Edward Watson) exchanging such tortured glances beneath a frozen explosion of candelabra, bird-cages, gas-lamps and mirrors? Why does she stalk him with such self-lacerating anguish? Why does he reject her? Could she conceivably be Constance Fenimore Woolson, who committed suicide after falling in love with the sexually ambiguous Henry James? A brief programme quote from The Master by Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn (which is about the novelist's life), suggests that this is a long-shot possibility. Who knows? Castle Nowhere is bleakly impressive, but there's isn't an obvious way in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
