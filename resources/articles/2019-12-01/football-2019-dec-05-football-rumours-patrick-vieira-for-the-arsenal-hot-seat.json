Thursday\u2019s name in the frame is Patrick Vieira. The former Invincible, currently in charge at Nice, has impressed high-ups at the Emirates and is being seriously considered, according to the French newspaper Nice-Matin. Vieira himself is doing the obligatory \u201cI\u2019m just concentrating on my job\u201d thing. \u201cThere is nothing to say about it,\u201d he sniffed. \u201cThere is nothing serious, nothing real. I have no comments to make about that.\u201d On actual playing matters, Arsenal are reportedly keen on plucking the 17-year-old German striker Karim Adeyemi from the Austrian second tier, where he is on loan at Liefering from RB Salzburg, and spiriting him to the Emirates. Adeyemi has eight goals in 13 appearances this season, but Arsenal are likely to face competition from Liverpool and Barcelona for the teenager. Talking of Liverpool, Rhian Brewster is set to be the subject of competition between Championship promotion hopefuls Leeds and Swansea for a loan move in January, according to the Times. Leeds are also teeing up a move for Newcastle\u2019s Dwight Gayle. Chelsea\u2019s fantasy January shopping list is eye-catching, but it will remain a fantasy unless the appeal against their transfer ban succeeds \u2013 a verdict is expected later on Thursday. Nonetheless, according to the Express it includes Leicester\u2019s Ben Chilwell, valued at \u00a360m plus, and perennial target-for-everyone Jadon Sancho. Heading in the other direction might be Emerson Palmieri, who\u2019s not had much of a look-in at Stamford Bridge since arriving nearly two years ago: Internazionale and Juventus are keen on the defender, for whom Chelsea would seek around \u00a325m. Manchester United have joined the race with Liverpool for the Atalanta midfielder Dejan Kulusevski, offering \u00a321m for the 19-year-old Swede, currently on loan at Parma, according to the Daily Star. Talk of United\u2019s midfield enables us to give some air to the latest Paul Pogba tittle-tattle \u2013 Real Madrid\u2019s Zinedine Zidane still wants him \u201cat all costs\u201d, according to Marca. Which could give Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r chance to put flesh on the bones of the rumour that he will bid for Tottenham\u2019s Christian Eriksen. And finally, having beaten West Ham on Wednesday night in their 194th match of the season, Wolves are now looking to beat the Hammers in the race for the Milan midfielder Franck Kessi\u00e9."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
