The Super League champions, who have slipped to eighth in the table with consecutive defeats by Wigan and Leeds and a two-point deduction for breaching the salary cap, have beaten off competition from Wigan, among others, to lure Talau from the Canterbury Bulldogs. Talau, 27, replaces Paul Newlove, the former Great Britain centre who was recently told he will not be offered a contract for next season, as the Saints coach Ian Millward attempts to revitalise his ageing squad. Meanwhile, the appeals of St Helens, Hull and Halifax, who were found guilty of breaching the salary cap last season, will be heard on July 14 by a panel convened by the Rugby Football League. The league's directors will consider their next move in the negotiations over a new television contract at a board meeting tomorrow morning. According to the weekly Rugby League Express, seven of the 12 Super League clubs have voted to accept a five-year deal worth \u00a353m from BSkyB, but the Big Five - Wigan, Leeds, St Helens, Bradford and Hull - are prepared to hold out for a better offer. Hull have another injury crisis before this Friday's televised game against Castleford. Richie Barnett, who was a late withdrawal from last Friday's defeat at Wigan, is still struggling to recover from a neck injury and his fellow Kiwi Toa Kohe-Love is definitely out after dislocating his shoulder. Hull now seem set to lose both Kohe-Love and their Australian hooker Dean Treister to Bradford next season, with two more Aussies, Craig Greenhill and Sean Ryan, also looking elsewhere. Castleford's chief executive Richard Wright is in Sydney trying to sign the Roosters forward Jason Cayless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
