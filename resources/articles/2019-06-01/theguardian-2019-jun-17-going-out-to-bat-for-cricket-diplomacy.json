After 40 years of going to the Brecon Beacons national park every holiday and any spare time we have, we decided it was time to learn the language. We started in January (the oldest people in the class by far), and are finding it extremely difficult, but are determined to keep going \u2013 whether cool or not. Dyn ni\u2019n siarad Cymraeg, afall! Joanie Speers Llanddeusant, Carmarthenshire (and London) \u2022 Cricket diplomacy \u2013 what a good idea (Rain fails to stop play as new friends turn out for old rivalry, 17 June). With a great former cricketer as prime minister of Pakistan, this surely should be pursued. It was a tragedy when Nehru and Jinnah, who had led the campaign for independence together with Gandhi, forced partition, with the loss of a million lives at the time and continuing conflict, actual or potential, ever since. How about a Test match between a joint India/Pakistan team and the Rest of the World? Frank Jackson Harlow, Essex \u2022 I\u2019m a fan of bluegrass music (Plucked from obscurity, Review, June 15), which is often played by virtuosos, but the assertion that it is \u201cas improvisatory as jazz\u201d is a preposterous suggestion, as untrue as it is unnecessary. David Flower London \u2022 Considerable anger has been expressed at the withdrawal of free TV licences for the over-75s (Report, 11 June). Could Sky show the way by offering its services free for this age group? Peter Curbishley Great Durnford, Salisbury \u2022 Doreen Weppler-Grogan (Letters, 17 June) refers to the island of Cuba as \u201ctiny\u201d, but Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, half as big as the UK and almost as large as England.
