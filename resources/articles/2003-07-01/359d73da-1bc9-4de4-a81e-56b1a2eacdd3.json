An audience of 600 people is waiting expectantly for the main event: the arrival of Tony Blair. It is Thursday night. That day the Prime Minister visited a hospital in Aintree, was questioned closely by a Granada television special on the health service, and unveiled a memorial to a policeman killed in a hit-and-run. He has shrugged off the London hot-house to begin one of the most significant changes of gear since the last general election. It is the relaunch of New Labour. This is where the Prime Minister is comfortable, among his supporters. He cracks a joke: 'The last time I was here was for one of Cherie's dad's weddings.' There is laughter, including from his wife, daughter of often-married actor Tony Booth, in the front row. Blair gets into his stride. It is time for Labour to 'renew its vows with the country'. He talks about the policies that will win the 'historic third term'. 'That is what we are here to do,' he says. Labour must never 'lose the will to govern'. The next day, after a visit to the specialist oncology department at Clatterbridge near Liverpool and an opening at the massive Airbus factory in North Wales where the new 'super jumbo jet' is being built, he sits in his chair on the RAF 146 and considers his future. It is lunchtime on Friday and the flight back to RAF Northolt in west London will take less than an hour. From there, he will speed to Chequers and a weekend planning the step change he wants to put in place over the next five days. He admits that the past few months 'have been a bit ragged'. He appears frustrated. The public is at its most negative about him and his Government. He agrees that this is the first time a New Labour Government has received a proper dose of the mid-term blues. The Blair project appears off course. Foundation hospitals created a row. The Cabinet reshuffle created a row. Then there was tax, when Peter Hain suggested a new 50 per cent rate for those earning over \u00a3100,000. Number 10 had to tell him to remove the offending passage from the speech. Another furious row. Blair's speech on getting out of the 'technocratic' management of government was reported in the press yesterday as a 'dumping of targets'. Another row. Not true, say Number 10 officials. The NHS has actually turned the corner, Blair insists. Targets will stay, but there needs to be a bigger political message, he needs to re-engage with the public. Who is the Government really for? And the waves keep coming. In Iraq British soldiers are dying. There is still no evidence of Saddam's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. And what about Alastair Campbell and the 'sexing up' of intelligence material? Robin Cook and Clare Short have resigned. And there is a sense of drift among senior officials who wonder aloud why they can't get 'the message' over to a disaffected public. It is time to 'get a grip' on the domestic agenda or see the Tories increase their poll lead. On 2 August, Blair will head the longest-serving Labour Government ever, longer than Wilson in the Sixties or Attlee in the Forties and early Fifties. Another little bit of history. 'The essential thing is to give people back the clear sense of our purpose,' he says as the plane climbs through the clouds. 'Now for nine months, frankly, the political agenda has been dominated by Iraq. In addition to that, I think when these changes are going through you do tend to get lost in the managerial changes, and therefore it is important always to be bringing people back to what the purpose of them is - the reason for foundation hospitals, or the new diagnostic treatment centres, or the changed contracts for GPs, and nurses, and consultants, the Private Finance Initiative in hospital building, the reason for all these things is to renew the health service for today's world, when the Conservatives are absolutely determined to get rid of it in its present form. 'That is why we mustn't flinch from the reforms, we must carry on, we must make the changes, because the whole purpose of the health service reforms is to put power in the hands of the ordinary patient, irrespective of their wealth.' He reels off a list of achievements to those who say the Government appears becalmed. 'The best school results we've ever had.' Point one. 'All the health service indicators are more positive than in 1997.' Point two. 'Crime is down, not up, since we came to power.' Point three. Yet the polls are moving against him. 'In the substance of policy we have been driving it forward. I think now we have got to go out there and explain to people this is what we are doing and this is why we are doing it,' he said. 'We are for ordinary, hard-working families who have got to make ends meet, who need economic stability, otherwise they end up with negative equity, who need high levels of employment, otherwise they end up being made redundant, who can't afford private healthcare, who need to send their kids to state school, and who can't hire private security people and therefore need the streets properly policed. Those are the people that we represent. 'What we did was we put together a coalition of traditional Labour supporters and people of ambition and aspiration, and that is still the same coalition that is there. We are in mid-term, things get tougher, you take a few knocks.' This week he will make a major speech on criminal justice reform, meeting the 'judge who cleaned up New York', Alex Calabrese. Calabrese set up teenage courts in the city and got graffiti writers to clean up their own mess. David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, invited him over to see the Prime Minister. Blair will then appear before the House of Commons Liaison Committee on Tuesday, the powerful parliamentary body made up of the chairmen of all Commons' committees. On Friday he meets Bill Clinton, the former US President, to ask: How do 'progressive' governments keep up a head of steam? But however hard he tries, he cannot shake off the international agenda. On Iraq, Blair makes a remarkable admission, which goes some way towards explaining why the post-conflict plans appeared to be so rushed and changeable. 'When I was talking to General [Tommy] Franks [US commander in Iraq] the other day, he reminded me that under the original timetable for the conflict it was going to take 125 days after the ground action began to complete the conflict. Well, we are still within 125 days now, so I think it is possible to exaggerate the problems and difficulties.' Tomorrow will see the publication of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee report on Iraq and the case for war. It will deal with the direct claim that Number 10, and more particularly Campbell, Blair's director of communications and strategy, inserted a claim that Saddam could deploy WMD within 45 minutes. Campbell said the allegation was a lie. 'It is untrue, that statement is untrue,' Blair said. 'The idea that I or anyone else in my position, frankly, would start altering intelligence evidence - or saying to the intelligence services I am going to insert this - is absurd. 'You could not make a more serious charge against a Prime Minister, that I ordered our troops into conflict on the basis of intelligence evidence that I falsified. The charge happens to be wrong. I think everyone now accepts that that charge is wrong.' Not the BBC, which was this weekend sticking to the position that the source of the anonymous story was 'credible', and it was justified in running the story. 'I am astonished, if they are still saying it is accurate, on what basis are they saying that? Whether they had a source or not, only they know. But the claim that the source was making, if that was the claim that they were making, was not true. 'If people make a claim and it turns out to be wrong, they should accept it is wrong.' It is as far as he will go without actually demanding an apology. But the tone of his voice and body language is clear. 'I am not getting into that [whether the BBC should apologise]. Look, as far as I am concerned, the issue of what the BBC has done, I take it as about as serious an attack on my integrity as there could possibly be, and the charge is untrue and I hope that they will accept that. I think they should accept it. That is all I am going to say.' And what of the 'dodgy' dossier, the document published in February supposedly made up of new intelligence material which Foreign Secretary Jack Straw described as a 'complete Horlicks'? 'We apologise for that.' He points out that there was new intelligence in the document, it was just unclear which bits. Did he inadvertently mislead the Commons when he spoke of laying 'new intelligence' before Parliament on the day the February dossier was published? 'No, because the intelligence informa tion that was in that document was indeed intelligence information.' The row has raised again the issue of Campbell. After the last election he announced that he would be withdrawing from frontline media briefing and would be taking a more behind-the-scenes, strategic role. Campbell, after all the allegations of a Government obsessed by spin, had to take himself out of the limelight. But now he is out, front and centre again. It cannot be a comfortable place for the Prime Minister to find the man whom many describe as the real deputy prime minister. 'It is not a very comfortable position to be accused of falsifying intelligence,' the Prime Minister retorts. 'He is also under personal attack. Look, we are used to this now, but people have to understand why. Those people who want to attack the people round me, attack their integrity, they are doing it for a reason, and they are doing it in order to try and make sure that they damage the credibility of the Government. 'And in relation to this particular allegation, that was an allegation levelled against Alastair personally. I think it is right that he answers it. He went out there [into the public eye] in order to defend himself against a very, very serious charge - once they decided they couldn't make it against me personally, they made it against him personally. 'You know the only reason it has taken a long time is because the BBC still says, \"Well, I am sorry, but you know even though we can't tell you who this source is, and it is perfectly obvious he wasn't even a member of the Joint Intelligence Committee, nonetheless we are sticking by the story\".' Some have spoken of a distancing in the relationship between Blair and Campbell, that the old chemistry is starting to wear thin. 'He is a big, strong player and he is absolutely superb in a job that is immensely difficult,' Blair retorts. But surely the relationship, which goes to the very heart of the New Labour project, must be cooler now? 'You don't cool when you are working as closely as that with people.' Robin Cook said that all this was a distraction in any case, that it was all very convenient for the Government to make the issue of WMD a straight fight between it and the BBC. What about the bigger questions: was Saddam really an imminent threat and where are his weapons? 'Firstly, let me say that I have never disrespected people who took a different view on the war. It is perfectly understandable that they should, and I entirely understand the concerns of those who supported us in the war who say, well, produce the WMD now. 'What is essential to realise, though, is the following: first, there is no doubt that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. 'There was an inventory of his weapons when the inspectors discovered the full extent of those programmes, and there was then a further inventory done by the UN inspectors in 1998 when they were forced to leave. 'There is an outstanding gap between those two, so on any basis there are unaccounted-for weapons of mass destruction. 'Secondly, the intelligence that we had is absolutely clear, and I have no doubt it was true that those programmes were continuing once the inspectors were expelled. 'But the third point is, it has always been our case that, following the UN resolutions, Saddam put in place a programme of concealment. And as former UN inspectors themselves have said, until you get the experts and witnesses talking about this it is going to be very hard to discover this. 'That is why what we are now doing, and it has only just started, is interviewing the scientists and the experts, and it is not in the least surprising that that will take time to do. 'Remember for 30 years we were trying to find weapons dumps in Northern Ireland, and didn't.' The Prime Minister says that the public will be given the evidence in time, but not in dribs and drabs. A third 'dossier' on Saddam's WMD looms later in the year. Travelling with the Prime Minister, one Number 10 official admitted that people were 'almost waiting for summer now', suggesting that Blair needs a break, needs to come back for the start of the new political season in the autumn with fresh vigour. Blair leaves the plane in his shirt sleeves, thanking his staff for their work during the trip. His armoured Jaguar leaves the airstrip with police outriders and flashing lights. He begins reading his briefing papers on the journey to Chequers, perhaps thinking a little more about how to get his 'historic project' back on track."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
