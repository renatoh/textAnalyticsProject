The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster was speaking on Friday morning after Boris Johnson wrote to Jeremy Corbyn accusing him of seeking to \u201cfiddle\u201d a second referendum vote in favour of remain by proposing to enfranchise 2 million EU nationals, in effect undermining the outcome of the 2016 vote. Although Gove praised the contribution of EU nationals to the UK, he said allowing them to vote in referendums would go against the principle of democratic fairness. \u201cIt is the case that EU nationals don\u2019t vote, have never voted in general elections, and therefore don\u2019t vote, have never voted in referendums like the Brexit referendum \u2013 and, therefore, we just think it would be unfair,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a rugby league final, 13 players on either side. If one team suddenly said we\u2019re going to play rugby union instead and bring two extra players on to the field, that simply wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201d The interviewer said EU nationals were in fact allowed to vote in local authority, mayoral and European parliament elections. Gove said he understood Labour\u2019s argument but it would be a fundamental \u201cassault on the basic democratic principle\u201d. He added: \u201cWhat makes it worse, I think, to fair-minded observers is the idea that the referendum next time round, if the Labour party were to come into power, would be run according to different rules, and rules that every objective observer says would be more likely to favour remain.\u201d Asked why Corbyn, a longtime Eurosceptic, would seek to effectively prevent the UK from leaving the EU, Gove said the majority of the parliamentary Labour party and the shadow cabinet was in favour of remaining. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said she believed it was right that people who had lived in the UK for much of their lives and had children at British schools should be allowed to vote in a potential future Brexit referendum. \u201cUnder a Labour government, we\u2019ve stated that any EU national who is living here at the time we exit the European Union will be guaranteed the right to stay here as a citizen,\u201d she told the Today programme. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to ensure those people have the opportunity to vote over their future. It\u2019s not just about the future of people who were born here, it\u2019s about the future of people who contribute to our economy and have done for a very long time.\u201d Labour pledged in its manifesto to extend voting rights to all UK residents and lower the voting age to 16, in what the party said would be \u201cthe largest extension of the franchise in generations\u201d. Speaking to Sky earlier on Friday, Long-Bailey claimed the extension of the franchise would not \u201cskew\u201d the outcome of the referendum, and defended the principle of a second EU vote. \u201cAfter three years of drama and chaos, we\u2019re still in a state of affairs where we don\u2019t have a credible Brexit deal to put before parliament, let alone the people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason we\u2019ve called for that second referendum is to give people the opportunity to decide on whether a credible Labour deal is what they voted for and, if not, they can vote to remain. \u201cIt\u2019s not right to have a system that denies [EU nationals] the vote. It\u2019s important to let them participate in their future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
