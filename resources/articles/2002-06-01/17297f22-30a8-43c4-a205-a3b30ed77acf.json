Henman begins his quest for a first grand-slam title at Wimbledon today as one of the favourites to succeed the absent Goran Ivanisevic as champion. The 27-year-old is one of only a handful of players who looks entirely comfortable on grass and knows Wimbledon represents by far his best chance of winning one of the game's four major titles. And the British No1 believes the fact his rivals know that as well means he has the upper hand in the mental battle when he faces them across the net in SW19. \"Players look at my game and the way it is suited to grass, the reputation helps,\" said Henman, who has reached the semi-finals at the All England Club for three of the last four years. \"You need to take all the help you can. If it is a psychological advantage, I will take it. \"The biggest factor is the support. The atmosphere at my matches is second to none and that has certainly won me difficult matches, got me through in tight fifth sets and on the other side of the net, certainly puts pressure on my opponents.\" Henman faces the qualifier Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bachelot in the first round and is expected to breeze through into the second round where he will face another qualifier in the shape of either Scott Draper of Australia or Italy's Cristiano Caratti. Henman's grass-court preparation has been satisfactory if not spectacular as he battled through to the final of Queen's only to lose to the world No1 Lleyton Hewitt for the second year running. In the women's event Britain's Jane O'Donoghue insists she can bring down the top seed and reigning champion Venus Williams on Wimbledon's centre court today. The 19-year-old from Wigan, ranked 344th in the world, has the daunting task of facing the world's top player in the first round but she radiated confidence when she arrived at the All England Club yesterday. \"I'm very excited,\" she said. \"Just walking through the gates with the crowds was a great feeling. This is everything I've worked for for the last 10 years. It's going to be a great day.\" O'Donoghue, handed a wild card, will be playing her first competitive match at Wimbledon, where British hopes traditionally fade after the opening round of the women's singles. \"It's about time we had a British player who started to do things and hopefully the crowd will be cheering for me.\" Williams, a millionairess, is evens favourite to retain her crown against a player who has to buy her own rackets and, until a deodorant company stepped up with a last-minute deal, operated without a sponsor. \"Nobody is unbeatable,\" she insisted. \"I've got to go out there and be aggressive and believe I can beat her.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
