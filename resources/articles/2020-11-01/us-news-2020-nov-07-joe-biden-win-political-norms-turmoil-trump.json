Thousands of Americans took to the streets, cheering, banging pots and pans and honking car horns to celebrate the outcome after four anxious days of waiting for votes to be counted. Trump was at his golf course in Virginia when the result was announced and refused to concede. Biden claimed the victory in the state where he was born, Pennsylvania, whose 20 electoral college votes put him over the threshold of 270. He had more than 74m votes in total, higher than any other presidential candidate in history. The former senator and vice-president said he was \u201chonored and humbled\u201d by the people\u2019s verdict. \u201cWith the campaign over, it\u2019s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for America to unite. And to heal. \u201cWe are the United States of America. And there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do, if we do it together.\u201d Biden was due to address the nation from Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday evening. From Atlanta to New York, from Philadelphia to Washington, there were spontaneous explosions of joy. A crowd gathered on Black Lives Matter Plaza outside the White House, cheering and holding balloons depicting Trump\u2019s face and hair. One person brandished a sign that, quoting Trump on his reality TV show The Apprentice, proclaimed: \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d In Times Square, New York, people danced, whooped and punched the air at the realisation Trump would be consigned to the history books as an impeached one-term president. Biden\u2019s triumph is likely to be welcomed by international allies as a course correction after 2016, when a shock election result represented a leap into the political unknown, rattling the consensus on immigration, trade and the global order. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, tweeted his congratulations to Biden and said he looked forward to working with him. Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, France, tweeted: \u201cWelcome back America!\u201d Trump, a property tycoon and reality TV star, was the first president without prior political or military experience. Even as the incumbent, he continued to portray himself as the disrupter and outsider who once boasted: \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d Biden, by contrast, sealed the presidency 48 years to the day after winning election to the Senate at the age of 29. He served for eight years as Barack Obama\u2019s right-hand man and, turning 78 later this month, will be the oldest president in US history. His running mate, Kamala Harris, is set to become the first woman and only the second person of colour to serve as vice-president \u2013 the first was Charles Curtis, Herbert Hoover\u2019s vice-president, who was a member of Kaw Nation. Harris tweeted footage of herself wearing sunglasses and jogging gear in a park, speaking to Biden by phone: \u201cWe did it, we did it, Joe. You\u2019re going to be the next president of the United States!\u201d She laughed elatedly. Hillary Clinton, the former senator and secretary of state who lost her bid to become the first female president in 2016, tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s a history-making ticket, a repudiation of Trump, and a new page for America.\u201d Biden, whose life has been scarred by tragedy, made empathy, decency and democracy central to his candidacy in an election he characterised as a battle for the soul of America. He called for voters to reject Trump\u2019s chaotic management style, cascade of lies, incendiary racism and bungled response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 235,000 in the US. The nation had to wait longer than in any presidential election since 2000 to learn the outcome, with vote counting slowed by a massive turnout and record number of mail-in ballots due to the pandemic. On Saturday, Trump continued to wage a months-long campaign to undermine the integrity of the democratic process, tweeting claims of fraud without proof while his campaign filed lawsuits legal experts said had little or no merit. He showed no sign of conceding defeat \u2013 a move that has no constitutional or legal relevance. In a statement, Trump declared that \u201cthis election is far from over\u201d and added: \u201cBeginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. \u201c\u2026 I will not rest until the American people have the honest vote count they deserve and that democracy demands.\u201d The mood at the White House, which had been secured by high barrier walls, was said to be oscillating between despair and defiance. \u201cThey know he\u2019s lost, but no one seems willing to tell King Lear or Mad King George that they\u2019ve lost the empire,\u201d an unnamed Republican source told the Washington Post. The president received short shrift from Philadelphia mayor Jim Kenney, who said on Friday that Trump should \u201cput his big-boy pants on\u201d and bow to the inevitable. Trump\u2019s authoritarian-like stand against democracy exposed fractures on his own side. Armed supporters in Phoenix and Detroit have insisted the election was being stolen and planned dozens of rallies under the banner \u201cStop the Steal\u201d on Saturday. Election officials say there has been no evidence of fraud. Some Republicans backed Trump\u2019s false claims of irregularities while others moved to distance themselves. Trump\u2019s two oldest sons, Donald Jr and Eric, used Twitter to assail Republicans for not doing more to fight their father\u2019s cause. Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican national committee, tweeted in response to the result: \u201cIn order for Americans to have confidence in our elections, we need time to let the canvassing and certification process take place, along with any investigations of irregularities or fraud play out.\u201d But Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland and a potential candidate for the presidential nomination in 2024, said this week there was \u201cno defence\u201d for Trump\u2019s comments \u201cundermining our democratic process. America is counting the votes, and we must respect the results as we always have before.\u201d There were also signs that Rupert Murdoch could be turning against Trump. The editorial board of the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal wrote: \u201cTrump\u2019s legacy will be diminished greatly if his final act is a bitter refusal to accept a legitimate defeat. Republican officials will turn away, and eventually so will the American public that wants to see the election resolved.\u201d Both sides had framed the 2020 election as one of the most crucial in American history, as important as votes during the civil war in the 1860s and the great depression in the 1930s. The process went smoothly despite the pandemic and fears of foreign interference, producing the highest turnout in more than 100 years. Biden mounted unsuccessful bids for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008 and seemed destined to fail again in this year\u2019s primaries after heavy defeats in Iowa and New Hampshire. But after a solid win in South Carolina, the party rallied around him, including those seeking a more leftwing agenda. His victory over Trump was driven by strong support from groups including women, African Americans, white voters with college degrees and city residents. He was more than 4m votes ahead of Trump in the nationwide popular count. As president, Biden\u2019s honeymoon will be short. He inherits a nation in crisis as Covid-19 hits record highs, the economy struggles and unrest over racism and police brutality continues. He also faces a deeply polarised Washington where Republicans seem likely to retain the Senate and the ability to block his most ambitions plans. Obama, congratulating his former vice-president, said: \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate that Joe\u2019s got what it takes to be president and already carries himself that way. Because when he walks into the White House in January, he\u2019ll face a series of extraordinary challenges no incoming president ever has \u2013 a raging pandemic, an unequal economy and justice system, a democracy at risk, and a climate in peril.\u201d Biden has said his first priority will be developing a plan to contain and recover from the pandemic and, unlike Trump, to heed the advice of public health experts and scientists. He has also has pledged to restore competency to the White House after Trump praised authoritarian foreign leaders, offered encouragement to white supremacists and refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. But for now, millions of supporters felt a simple sense of relief that Trump would not be able to continue his emotionally and morally exhausting war on institutions, and truth, for a second term. Some recalled the words of President Gerald Ford after the resignation of Richard Nixon amid the Watergate scandal: \u201cOur long national nightmare is over.\u201d Bob Shrum, who was an adviser to Al Gore and John Kerry\u2019s presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004, said he hoped the Trump administration would \u201cbe seen an aberration in the American journey, as an attempt to go backwards, which at least, in terms of the supreme court, he will have achieved. It diminished America\u2019s standing in the world, which will take time to repair. \u201cI think it shocked the world that the United States could elect someone like that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
