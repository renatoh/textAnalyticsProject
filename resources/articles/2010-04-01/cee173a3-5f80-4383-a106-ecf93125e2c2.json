Apart from Rib\u00e9ry, who is French, and the French, as far as I remember, tend not to like being described as typically German. They've had some history on that front. Nor do the Dutch, people like the Bayern manager, Louis van Gaal. And if crowding around the referee hoping to influence his decision is a typical German thing to do, then it is probably just as well that Roy Keane ducked out of appearing at the 2002 World Cup, since Ireland were in the same group as Germany and that would have been an awkward reunion for the Corkman, given his well-chronicled tendency when playing for Man United to explain his position to referees, at volume, from close distance. Y'know, like a German. So the \"typically German\" comment was nonsense and a little ungracious. The question remains, though: was the sending-off of Rafael justified and more importantly, was it the turning point of the match? Hey, why don't you all work that out among yourselves in the comment section online? I'm going to talk quantum physics instead. There are those who think the arid world of this most obtuse science has little to do with football, believing the beautiful game can mainly be explained away through a combination of ballistics and psychology. They are ignoring the very cutting edge of the field. In quantum mechanics, much is made of the moment where all the potential outcomes of something, the location of a photon of light, say, must reduce down to just one when a measurement is made. Until the measurement occurs, goes the theory, every possible solution is valid. You may have heard this mentioned in the dilemma about Schr\u00f6dinger's cat. It's in a box and maybe it's dead or maybe it's not dead: we just don't know until we open the box and look in. There is even a theory, known as the multiverse theory, that maintains that at every possible moment where a choice is made, even at a molecular level, the entire universe branches off into separate parallel universes, each one containing a difficult outcome. This is high-powered stuff for physicists. It is, however, everyday talk for the average football fan. We manage to keep all manner of different realities floating in our mind at all times. If only he passed to the man on his left, if only he had remained injury-free, if only he'd kept his pants on. That kind of stuff. Often this isn't even stuff that would make Match of the Day's highlights. If you attend a match there's always a blocked through ball, say, or the wrong pass chosen, that you know in your heart would have left you three touches away from the winner if they hadn't messed up. That was your season right there and only you remember it. This stuff can lead to madness. I'm currently finding it hard to shake off the league table in my head that ignores the goal Kevin Phillips scored against Arsenal for Birmingham, when the ball deflected off his face in the last minute. It's a really exciting league table. In this reality, and with our 73 points, we only need Chelsea to drop two points to leapfrog them into first place. Things are properly hotting up. Of course the goal did go in, and fate will probably punish me for saying this by delivering up a series of results that leave Arsenal one point, and the width of Phillips's face, from winning the title. Similarly with Alex Ferguson and Rafael's sending-off. Teutonic interference or not, there is no way of knowing what the effect of a reprieve would have been. For a start he would have been even more likely to have been sent off the next time he fouled someone. For all we know he might have turned the ball into his own net three times by then, breaking Van der Sar's leg repeatedly in the process. Yes, maybe he would have been stationed on the very post that the Robben shot went in at, but he also might have been distracted away by a pretty butterfly at just the wrong moment. The one thing we definitely know about Rafael is that he's young and impetuous, and they are the type with the flightiest attention span. So who knows? The point is, Ferguson, like the rest of us, needs to have a moment to point to, a moment where his favourite parallel universe, the one where he wins the Champions League, disappeared down the track without him. And if quantum physics is right, that universe really exists. But then again, so does the universe where Lionel Messi lies on the turf a broken man, as I, yet again, clear the ball off his toe and scamper down the field. Schr\u00f6dinger, eh?
