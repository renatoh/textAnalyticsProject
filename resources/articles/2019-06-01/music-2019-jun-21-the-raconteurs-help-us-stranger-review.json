The four-man side project initially seemed like a release valve for White, an outlet for the ideas the self-imposed strictures of the White Stripes had stymied. A decade on, however, and a Raconteurs reunion feels like the inverse: as White surfaces from a period of unfettered self-indulgence \u2013 three solo albums in and he\u2019s well-established as an eccentric and largely irrelevant loose cannon \u2013 a new album provides an opportunity for some restraint. As on the band\u2019s debut, Help Us Stranger sees White\u2019s wild-eyed, Led Zep-indebted riffs tempered by the blindingly sunny Beatles-y hooks of songwriting partner Brendan Benson \u2013 a terminally underappreciated maker of indie-pop. The mood board is limited to 1960s and 70s rock: there\u2019s even a cover of Donovan\u2019s Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness) reworked to accommodate the trademark squeal of White\u2019s guitar. Opener Bored and Razed harnesses the ominous exuberance of classic rock to thrilling effect; Live a Lie channels beefy, adrenaline-triggering proto-punk; closer Thoughts and Prayers\u2019 doleful, uncomplicated beauty is reminiscent of Winwood/Clapton supergroup Blind Faith. It\u2019s an exercise in nostalgia that rarely feels tedious or tired, perhaps because the style the band references is so unfashionable it borders on forgotten. There is, however, an unpleasant whiff of the era\u2019s unreconstructed masculinity in the lyrics, which ring with barely contained aggression \u2013 from What\u2019s Yours Is Mine\u2019s furious order to \u201clisten very closely cos I\u2019m only going to say it twice\u201d to toxic breakup song Now That You\u2019re Gone (\u201cWho\u2019s gonna love you if it isn\u2019t me?\u201d). The more pressing flaw is the album\u2019s occasionally soupy quality: Help Me Stranger swirls with so many ideas that it\u2019s impossible to physically hear everything that\u2019s going on. The energy and exhilaration of the collaborative process might be palpable, but in its weaker moments Help Us Stranger sounds like the worst kind of compromise \u2013 cluttered, ill-defined and lacking the clarity of vision that once charged its driving forces."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
