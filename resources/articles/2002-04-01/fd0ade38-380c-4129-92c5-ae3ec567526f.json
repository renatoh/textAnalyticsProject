His nose wrinkles like he's just realised he's forgotten his freshly ironed handkerchief. After five minutes you're bored rigid, yet after 10 you're obsessed at the shininess of the shoes and after 20 you, too, are wondering who will get the initiative in this safety exchange - hypnotic clink after hypnotic clink. The World Championship at the Crucible comes round, a bit like Wimbledon, to captivate a proportion of the nation, who then promptly forget about it until the next year. It certainly obsesses the BBC, who can still just about afford to bid for the rights. They film every ball of every frame of every match, which takes place on the two holy raised green tables in Sheffield. Not that we see all of it, today it's only on BBC2 for seven and three-quarter hours between 1 and 10.30pm. Excessive programming? Perhaps, but we still turn on, a lot of us. An average of more than two million throughout the tournament for the past five years. All of which is pretty amazing, because snooker has what even Osama bin Laden would recognise as an image problem. Chas and Dave didn't help. This is a sport that takes place inside without any discernible outbreak of sweat. There is no crescendo of joy or sorrow from the crowd. Hair gel is still popular with the players; the make-up department hasn't yet been permitted to apply anti-shine powder to faces which spend hours under bright lights. And it's not outwardly very masculine - the referee wears dinky white gloves, one of the balls is pink and a lot of time is spent trying to kiss. So why does it stay so popular? And it's not just here, either - 60 countries are affiliated with the world governing body, and at the Chinese Masters they had to call in the guards to control the crowds fighting for Hendry's autograph. Over the past 10 years play has become more attacking and the standards have improved. But to the amateur watcher, that's not what's interesting (sorry). It's what snookermeister Clive Everton calls the \"marathon of the mind\". Over 17 days, longer than the Olympics, adversaries are forced to sit right next to each other, sipping iced water or polishing a cue in a manner that is not at all suggestive. Unlike in tennis, you can't show your frustration, you can't send down a 150mph ace. Everything happens at just above the decibel of a whisper. Everyone is waiting to see who will crack first. Missed shots are replayed on TV, so you see the quivering lower lip, the gentle shake of the head. Cameras focus on furrowed brows and tapping fingers. Professional snooker seems to be the English gentleman's last haven (indeed, it had its origins in colonial India). There is an almost Edwardian etiquette. Jimmy White issued a public apology for \"the way I reacted\" when he conceded a frame last week. He had lashed the cue ball and black off the table. Heady stuff from a man with, shall we say, a turbulent youth. If a member of the crowd has a cough, a player will pass back a glass of water. And of course the whole thing takes place in pristine evening dress - even though players haven't had to wear a tie this year, most have. Like in cricket, the crowd know their stuff. And like cricket, they can have a quick nap without it being the end of the world. A glance at the audience suggests a sprinkling of anoraks, but on Saturday night there was also a woman looking very like Betty Boothroyd in a red power suit and a bloke surreptitiously swigging at a bottle of champagne from under his seat. It is trying to become more glamorous. The commentators have taken to using a magic white pen, like the one Geoff Boycott uses to mark out where the slips should be standing, and there are cameras in the pockets. But the great thing about snooker is that it has got where it is while standing perfectly still. Because the governing body hasn't done marvels developing snooker around the world, the champions tend to be British. Because it was never cool, it hasn't got anything to live up to. And, it survived being broadcast on black and white television. For that alone, maybe, it deserves our licence money. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
