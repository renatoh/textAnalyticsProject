Revived earlier this year, with some cast changes, it has now reached London, and can only be described as a formidable achievement, at once fiercely intelligent and visceral in its power. Gardner\u2019s interpretation, already familiar from performances at ENO and the Proms, places the emphasis on the metaphysical links between the arbitrary violence of nature and the abyss of the human soul. The Bergen orchestra\u2019s playing combines richness with precision, and Britten\u2019s seascapes glittered balefully even in moments of uneasy calm. The storm of act one, meanwhile, found its hideous human counterpart in the lynch mob that later bays for Grimes\u2019s blood. Wexelsen\u2019s staging wisely concentrates on psychological subtlety rather than directorial glosses. Beer kegs form the minimal set, and the Apprentice\u2019s blood-red jersey, tellingly, is the only splash of colour amid predominant blue and black. Stuart Skelton\u2019s Grimes, visionary, curiously childlike and unaware of his own strength, shrinks from physical contact with Erin Wall\u2019s Ellen, but unthinkingly terrifies his Apprentice. Meanwhile, the omnipresence of the chorus \u2013 observers of the drama in which they also participate \u2013 lends the work something of the inexorability of classical tragedy. It was superbly sung. Combining lyricism with vocal weight, Skelton\u2019s well-nigh ideal Grimes has, if anything, gained in subtlety and depth with time: Now the Great Bear and Pleiades was pure poetry, ravishingly done. Wall made a lovely Ellen, vulnerable yet principled. Roderick Williams was the thoughtful, empathetic Balstrode, and the denizens of the Borough, all sharply characterised, included Marcus Farnsworth\u2019s raffish Ned Keene, Susan Bickley\u2019s knowing, world-weary Auntie and Catherine Wyn-Rogers\u2019 hypocritical, drug-ridden Mrs Sedley. The choral singing \u2013 from the combined forces of the Bergen Philharmonic and Royal Northern College of Music Opera Choirs, the Edvard Grieg Kor and the Collige\u00fbm M\u00fbsic\u00fbm \u2013 was electrifying throughout."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
