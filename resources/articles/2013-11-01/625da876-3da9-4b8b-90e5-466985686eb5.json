Peter Stylianou's microbudget thriller strives to rejuvenate the tired honour-among-thieves narrative with some grim business about child sex abuse, the detail of which is obscured from us less out of discretion than indifferent storytelling. Events are wrapped in a certain low-level flash \u2013 wardrobe from Burton's, ominous chapter headings, narcissistic slo-mo \u2013 but it's fundamentally alienating: you have to cheer yourself up by reasoning the grizzled faces drafted in to cameo as pederasts are those of retired newsagents and market traders, sweet-talked into making a less-than-wise investment of time and/or money."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
