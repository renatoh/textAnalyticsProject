An expensive French purchase by owner Darren Mercer, Asador led the field for a long way in the 2000 Elite Triumph Hurdle before finishing seventh of 28 to Snow Drop. He was subsequently found to have been injured and had not been seen since. Yesterday Asador beat Sayeh by 28 lengths after his two closest pursuers in the novice chase, Reiziger and Master Tern, came down at the final fence. The 11-8 favourite clearly had the two fallers beaten at the time and his trainer, Paul Nicholls, will be anxious to get him back on course soon if he comes out of the race injury-free. Nicholls said: \"I'm so pleased he's behaved himself on the course as he's been a bit wayward at home. Our conditional jockey, Anthony Honeyball, broke his jaw when the horse crashed through a wing when schooling one day. \"He actually broke down on both front legs in the Triumph Hurdle and it's taken all this time to get him back. \"We are going to have to see what he's like in the morning before we have any thoughts about the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
