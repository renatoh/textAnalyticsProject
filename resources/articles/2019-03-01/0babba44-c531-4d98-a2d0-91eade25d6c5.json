Jones\u2019s announcement came after United confirmed her contract had been terminated by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d after she was found guilty of making monkey noises at the Spurs centre-back Ren\u00e9e Hector in January. Jones, who was also fined \u00a3200 and ordered to attend an FA inclusion and diversity workshop, insisted she was \u201cnot guilty\u201d and had instead been the victim of a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d set up by the FA. \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I am unable to continue within football and play under an organisation that I do not have any confidence in,\u201d she said. \u201cI am struggling to come to terms with this decision. The FA \u2018independent\u2019 panel received more than 10 other witness statements from players in the vicinity including Tottenham players. Also all the match officials confirmed they did not hear any racial abuse and or comments made.\u201d The 27-year-old also accused the FA of ignoring video evidence and claimed two witness statements from Tottenham players had \u201ccontinuously contradicted each other\u201d. She said she did not condone racism in any form. The FA said Jones\u2019s case had been heard by an Independent Regulatory Commission comprised of two independent lawyers along with a former player and manager. They found she had broken the FA\u2019s Rule E1 \u2013 using abusive and/or insulting words \u2013 and her behaviour constituted an \u201caggravated breach\u201d of FA Rule E3 [2] as it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race. \u201cThe written reasons in the case will be published in due course, which will provide a detailed account of the evidence given and the findings of the commission,\u201d the FA added in a statement. \u201cThe FA continues to treat all allegations of discrimination seriously and encourages any player who believes they have been the subject of, or witness to, discriminatory abuse to report this through the appropriate panels.\u201d The FA confirmed Jones\u2019s ban will remain in place if she joins a new club, whether in the UK or abroad. After the verdict on Wednesday, Hector said she was happy with the decision. \u201cThere is no place for racism in our game,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cA zero tolerance policy is imperative in stamping this out, therefore I welcome this verdict. No one should be subjected to racist abuse on or off the pitch and I felt a responsibility to call it out for what it was. \u201cI want to now concentrate on the last five games of the FAWC and trying to secure promotion with Spurs. Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this process.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
