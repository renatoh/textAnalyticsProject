For the less philanthropic among us it\u2019s a chance to ogle amazing dresses. Everyone who\u2019s anyone has ascended the Met Museum steps over the years, normally dressed in sequins, silk or feathers. This book, by US Vogue editor-at-large Hamish Bowles, covers the party themes (Dangerous Liaisons, Jackie Kennedy) as well as the accompanying exhibitions.

His spring/summer 2015 collection was shown as part of the Topman sponsored MAN talent showcase, an experience he describes as surreal. But we think he\u2019ll have to get used to the attention. nicomedetalavera.com Louboutin now does nails Christian Louboutin\u2019s new beauty range launches this September with an exquisite collection of 30 luxurious nail varnishes.

It examines fashion moments and their impact. It focuses on Coco Chanel, whose silhouettes encouraged women to set their corsets aside, Diane von Furstenberg\u2019s wrap dress which introduced frocks to the boardroom, and Donna Karan\u2019s \u201cSeven Easy Pieces\u201d, made for working women in 1985.
