Nick Clegg met David Cameron on Wednesday to discuss their approach to the report, with the prime minister expected to call for a tough new independent press complaints body capable of imposing fines, and keeping the option of statutory regulation on the table for a later date if the new regulatory body is not working. The culture and media secretary, Maria Miller, has told leading newspaper figures, such as Lord Hunt, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, that their proposals for independent regulation are inadequate, too close to the industry and will need to be strengthened. Strenuous efforts were being made between Cameron and Clegg to find agreement on a response to the report. Clegg, Tory sources claimed, was pushing for the right to make an unprecedented separate statement in the Commons calling for a tougher approach. His office confirmed that he had made a precautionary request to the Speaker to see if he could make his own statement after Cameron gives his response in the Commons. Clegg and Cameron both received copies of the report on Wednesdaymorning. Clegg held phone calls on Wednesday night with Lib Dem cabinet colleagues before a rare meeting of the coalition committee on Thursday morning to be attended by the most senior members of the cabinet, including the business secretary, Vince Cable, and the education secretary, Michael Gove. Cameron is minded to demand a toughened up form of independent regulation, but to give the newspaper industry six months to put its house in order or face statutory controls. There are key figures in No 10 advising him that he cannot be seen to be soft on Tory-inclined newspapers, even if it sours relations between him and their proprietors. In a sign of the tensions before what will be a landmark day for politicians, the media and the police, Lib Dem sources said: \"This is not a problem for us \u2013 the person who has got a difficulty is David Cameron.\" A senior Tory source said: \"Labour and the Liberal Democrats are backing statutory regulation, even before they have seen the report. The Liberal Democrats are playing a dangerous game.\" At prime minister's questions, the inter-party tensions were hidden as Cameron said: \"I think we should try to work across party lines on this issue.\" Miller will meet her shadow, Harriet Harman, after the statement to discuss all-party talks, but Labour is determined to drive home the point that repeated promises in the past to improve self-regulation have been broken by the media. In the Commons, Cameron said continuation of the current system of regulation was \"not an option\" and that the victims of phone hacking needed to be uppermost in people's minds. He said: \"This government set up Leveson because of unacceptable practices in parts of the media and because of a failed regulatory system. What matters most, I believe, is that we end up with an independent regulatory system that can deliver and in which the public have confidence. \"One of the key things that the Leveson inquiry is trying to get to the bottom of is how can you have a strong, independent regulatory system so you don't have to wait for the wheels of the criminal justice system or the libel system to work. \"People should be able to rely on a good regulatory system as well to get the sort of redress they want, whether that is prominent apologies or fines for newspapers or the other things that are clearly so necessary.\" Two polls by ComRes, one for ITV and another for BBC Radio 5 Live, showed firm support for independent regulation backed by law. The ITV poll showed 51% of the public think the government should introduce statutory regulation of the media. Just 20% disagree and 30% don't know.The BBC poll showed 66% of respondents have not very much trust, or no trust, in British newspapers telling the truth. Almost half (47%) of those questioned said they most wanted a regulatory body for newspapers where the rules were agreed and enforced by the courts. Leveson's report is expected to contain major criticisms not just of the press but also of the Metropolitan police over their handling of the phone-hacking scandal and relations with the media. A warning letter to the Met says the force's own actions allowed to emerge a perception that certain media organisations were favoured. The force has also been warned that senior officers were encouraged to be close to the media over many years. Several past and serving officers have also been warned that the inquiry is minded to criticise them over their actions and decision-making during the first phone-hacking investigation in 2006, and then a decision to refuse for 18 months from the summer of 2009 to reopen the criminal investigation despite mounting evidence that the number of victims was much wider than officially admitted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
