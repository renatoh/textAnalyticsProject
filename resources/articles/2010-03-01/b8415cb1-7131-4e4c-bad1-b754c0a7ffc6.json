Don't read on if you haven't seen episode six \u2013 and if you've seen more of the series, please be aware that many UK viewers will not have done \u2026 Richard Vine's episode five blog \"Sundown\" Whenever Sayid is around, the violence levels step up several gears. As does my belief that the island is in fact purgatory and that Sayid is seeking redemption (or not). He is plunging through the levels of purgatory at some rate. He has killed a lot of people (his brother's debt collectors, and Dogen and Lennon this week alone) and has died quite a few times too (the plane crash [?!], when he was shot/drowned) and should have been killed a whole load more times too, most obviously when he stabbed the really scary fella this week: Sayid: \"What are you?\" Flocke: \"Well, Sayid, you seem to have some idea about that considering you stabbed me in the chest without even saying 'hello'.\" This episode was laced with religious imagery and dialogue: \"I'm a good man,\" says Sayid; \"Evil incarnate,\" is Dogen's description of Flocke; while the debt collector's egg eating, is reminiscent of that running theme in Angel Heart, where the cunningly named Louis Cyphre eats eggs and compares them to men's souls. And then there is Sayid's heartfelt explanation to Nadia about why he can't have a relationship with her: \"For the last 12 years I have been trying to wash my hands of all the horrible things I have done.\" (This might be an appropriate moment to say I am no expert on Catholicism or how purgatory actually works, but think that, like most religion, it is what you make of it yourself.) As well as the religion, there is also some almighty backtracking and double-crossing. After Mad Claire's axing of one of the Others last week, we had Dogen almost kill Sayid, before persuading Sayid to try to kill Flocke, and then Flocke persuading Sayid to kill Dogen. And then, after all that, we were actually confronted with an island that has much more clarity than at any stage in possibly five seasons (indeed, since we first discovered there were Others on the island). There are now two armies there. And in honour of sbryantgb we can have a new category this week: The grand alliance count Allied with Jacob: Hurley, Sun (getting tantalisingly close to finding Jin), Ilana (who knows where the secret passages are. How?), Frank, with Jack a possibility. Allied with Flocke: Claire, Sayid, the living half of the temple Others who gave up without much of a fight. Where was Sawyer in all of this? And who will Kate and Jin back? Polar bear watch (because we like it, and so does Magnus38) Obviously there was no sign, but we live in hope. Cameo of the week/meeting up in the alternative (final?) universe What was Jin doing locked in the loan shark's cold store? Jack in the hospital was a much simpler crossover. Numbers watch After Jack's lighthouse nightmare last week, the numbers were given a back seat. Quote of the week Sayid: \"And you want me to speak to him [Flocke]?\" Dogen: \"No, I want you to kill him.\" Sayid: \"Since I have been here I have been drowned, beaten and tortured by you. Why would I ever do anything for you?\" Sayid then promptly goes off to stab Flocke. Predictions It will take Kate several weeks (if ever) to decide whose side she is in on all of this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
