The guidelines are part of further measures to beef up security by checking all baggage that goes into aircraft holds. Before 11 September 2001, only 5 per cent of hold luggage was checked. The ABI said it was examining the new rule and, after consulting its members, may change its policy. 'For now, the message is that people should contact their insurance companies to find out if they are covered should items be stolen from unlocked bags,' said a spokeswoman. Preferential Insurance, Primary Insurance and Columbus Direct said that holidaymakers would still be covered if theft did occur from an unlocked case. However, a Columbus spokesman said the company might have to change its policy if there was a raft of claims, either genuine or fraudulent. Although there has been a delay in installing some of the screeners in 429 US airports, all bags are now being checked, some by hand or sniffer dogs. Should any luggage be locked, it will be opened but any damage will not be paid for. US officials are also advising holidaymakers not to pack food or beverages in hold luggage, as they tend to set off alarms, or to pack film in their suitcases, as it would be damaged by screening equipment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
