In no uncertain terms, she delivers. Don\u2019t Start Now is a flex in every sense: Lipa sets herself apart by eschewing the charts\u2019 predominant rap-influenced sound and going classic. It starts with the tightest disco bassline, adding strings and sparkle until the song\u2019s sharp scaffolding builds out to an opulent penthouse, all velvet cushions and mirrored halls. And her voice is the ritziest fixture of all: she swoons witheringly as she reminds a begging ex that he was the one who ditched her \u2013 via a canny I Will Survive reference \u2013 and struts when she says she\u2019s quite all right without him, thanks very much indeed. It\u2019s the inverse of Robyn\u2019s Call Your Girlfriend: a confident shot across the bows in which she makes clear that if he comes after her, chances are she\u2019ll be snogging someone else. Sorrynotsorry. LS Victoria Mon\u00e9t \u2013 Ass Like That One of the key figures in helping Ariana Grande ascend to her current place in the pop firmament is songwriter and producer Victoria Mon\u00e9t, who has credits on every one of Grande\u2019s albums, including some definitive hits like Thank U, Next. Earlier this year the pair duetted on the single Monopoly, with palpable chemistry: \u201cI\u2019m so thankful working with my best friend, she the cheat code,\u201d they rap at one another. Fanbase duly widened, Mon\u00e9t is gearing up for a solo project in 2020, and this single is a sensational calling card for it: perhaps the best R&amp;B track of the year. Over gorgeous production flourishes like a bathwater-warm brass section and a distorted guitar solo, she sings a witty, equally warm song admiring her own behind \u2013 one that has men apparently regarding it not so much with lechery as baffled wonderment. BBT L\u00e5psley \u2013 My Love Was Like the Rain Before the current crop of super-young, hyper-emotional pop stars \u2013 Billie Eilish, Beabadoobee, Clairo et al \u2013 there was L\u00e5psley, who released her confident, heartfelt debut aged just 19. Three years on, with millions of streams and the greatest disco song of recent years in the DJ Koze-remixed Operator behind her, she\u2019s returned with this wise, poetic new single. With a smooth, cool electropop backing, she characterises the love she gives as various natural elements \u2013 sky, rain, sea, fire, flowers \u2013 and there is such sureness to her voice as she sings: \u201cSo I embody these elements / I wear them as a fragrance.\u201d It\u2019s the bracing sound of someone who has figured out who they are \u2013 until the next youthful epiphany. BBT Harry Styles \u2013 Lights Up Someone else who sounds like they\u2019ve done some growing up and learning is Harry Styles, who has released the best song yet of any of the ex-One Directioners. The lyrics have been read by internet gossips as a defiant announcement of bisexuality, though truth be told they\u2019re so vague (\u201cI could, but wouldn\u2019t stay / Wouldn\u2019t put it like that / What do you mean? / I\u2019m sorry by the way\u201d) that he still sounds buffeted by confusion. There is a stridency, though, to the chorus line: \u201cStep into the light \u2026 I\u2019m not ever going back.\u201d Musically, it doesn\u2019t sound like anything else in the charts \u2013 there\u2019s a touch of the cosmic funk of Tame Impala, but the gospel chorus, supple bassline and Balearic guitars all cohere into something genuinely fresh. BBT Twin Atlantic \u2013 Novocaine This is rock music at its most compressed and synthetic \u2013 a sound that can be wretchedly empty. But the Scottish band, approaching veteran status with 13 years in the game, have a truly euphoric chorus that befits their recent jump to a major label. The lyrics are all drunken, teary blank poetry \u2013 \u201cIf I\u2019m nothing, you\u2019re it all / My foolish electric heart\u201d \u2013 sung with jolting passion by Sam McTrusty. There are shades of Bloc Party\u2019s Helicopter to the rhythm guitar and relentless pace, and the whole endeavour is suffused with the Big Music of their Celtic forebears: Simple Minds, U2, the Waterboys, the Blue Nile, Big Country et al. BBT Davido \u2013 Risky (feat. Popcaan) West Africa meets the Caribbean \u2013 via, for the video, a housing estate in west London \u2013 in this brilliantly written pop-dancehall ballad, with Nigeria\u2019s Davido and Jamaica\u2019s Popcaan stepping and skanking around the beat with nimble vocal melodies. Their earnestness and casual mastery makes the track, but credit also to producer Speroach Beatz, whose love of lithe, ringtone-cutesy melodies has cemented him as one of the prime movers in the Afropop scene. BBT Selena Gomez \u2013 Lose You to Love Me There\u2019s unavoidable celebrity subtext here: Lose You to Love Me is a towering revenge ballad aimed at Justin Bieber, who reportedly broke up with Selena Gomez in spring 2018, only to be married to model Hailey Baldwin by that September. But Gomez\u2019s comeback (after she took a few years away to recover from lupus and a kidney transplant) stands independently from the gossip as a timeless riposte. The weighty piano is just spare enough to let her words sear (\u201csang off-key in my chorus \u2019cause it wasn\u2019t yours\u201d is a great evocation of someone\u2019s careless egoism), building to a chorus laden with choral backing vocals. The amassed voices offer protection to her fairly devastating conclusion \u2013 one that sets new stakes for the self-love pop song: \u201cI needed to hate you to love me.\u201d There\u2019s an air of an avant-garde Adele to it, and it also marks the arrival of Billie Eilish\u2019s brother and producer, Finneas, into the big leagues. LS Destroyer \u2013 Crimson Tide Dan Bejar\u2019s voice has a very specific pleasure: it\u2019s laced with a sneer, and he tends to ease into a song weighed down by a sighing sense of contempt for the world around him. Yet he can\u2019t help himself from leaning in deeper, picking up the pace and stacking his opaque observations until they find a captivating sense of momentum. On Crimson Tide, there are \u201cchicken shit singers paying their dues\u201d, a funeral that \u201cgoes completely insane\u201d, a woman who instructs him to \u201cget into the zone\u201d when \u201cthe zone is brimstone and wire\u201d. His strange yet beguiling images slip down easier thanks to a synth-pop turn that rumbles in on classic Peter Hook bass and snapping drum machines. LS The Orielles \u2013 Come Down on Jupiter The Halifax band feel like the closest thing we have to a contemporary Stereolab: as sharp as they are spacey, at home with psychedelic wooze and seductively chugging guitar pop. The lead single from their forthcoming second album wildly expands the indie ambitions of their debut: it starts out mystic and silvery, the sound of coils lazily unwinding, then snaps into a determined riff that grows ever tighter, like a Chinese finger trap. There\u2019s no telling what dreamy singer Esme Dee Hand-Halford is on about (\u201cthrift shop cowboys\u201d, anyone?), but the four-piece mingle their joyful yips with Clangers-worthy cosmic transmissions, creating a unique, glittering energy. LS Lanark Artefax \u2013 Corra Linn It often takes an artist years for their sound to slough off its influences and reach maturity, but Scottish producer Lanark Artefax seemed to arrive fully formed in 2017 with his debut EP. Yes, there were hints of Aphex Twin and Arca, but the way his beatific chords spluttered and spat, like an ersatz gas fire on a flatscreen TV, was all his own. His live show, performed in front of a 2001-style monolith, is excellent, and it was little wonder Bj\u00f6rk came calling: his take on Arisen My Senses is one of the best ever remixes of her work. There\u2019s often a latent jungle energy to his tracks, which he brought to the fore for 2018\u2019s Styx, and is now combined into this chimeric lead track from an EP of the same name. As well as the breaks \u2013 and the startled vocal whoop that has become his signature \u2013 there are hints of dancehall and trap rhythms, and the tracks squirms around itself, never allowing itself comfort.
