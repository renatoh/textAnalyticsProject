You look red.\" \"Don't say that, Fatima,\" I replied very quickly. \"It's not polite.\" I was just back from a week lying on a beach in the Gambia. For the first five days of the long-awaited spring vacation I lay in bed with tonsillitis. For the second week I booked a last-minute deal with three fellow Teach First teachers. Our plan was to get a tan. However, I've got red hair and freckles, so sadly my efforts to go brown have in fact left me gently daubing raw aloe on to my red, raw skin. The top layers of skin have been slowly peeling off all week, hence Fatima's remark. And now I'm almost back to freckled white. Since the break, the school year has turned a corner. The light evenings give me the feeling that there is more to the school day than just the hours in the classroom. I've been waiting for the summer term since the beginning of this year. Last year, the summer term marked a shift in my teaching: after two terms of chaotic, high-octane lessons, I calmed down in the classroom - and the students followed suit. This year too there's a palpable difference. I've given up trying to fight my troublesome year 10 class and have instead become a paragon of calm. And after two terms of being largely miserable in each other's company, I feel they sort of trust me now. I've given up sending them out of the classroom as a way of controlling them: it created an unfeasible amount of paperwork for me and drove wedges between me and the students. The farce of getting them to leave the room made me simmer with exasperation. Today, however, I remained serene as I watched a student who didn't understand the task shred her worksheet into small squares that fluttered down to the floor. The year 11s are still showing no signs of honing their concentration, even though we have only a dozen lessons before their first exam. Recently, in an attempt to create a memorable lesson and bring a poem to life - and to demonstrate trust - I arranged the arms of six students into a net to catch me as I fell backwards off a table. I'm still not quite ready to do that with my year 10 class."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
