But even so, life for her family was a struggle. Her father\u2019s wage was paltry. In 1854, her parents and their six children were living in two rented rooms in Knightsbridge when scarlet fever and typhus broke out. In six weeks, these diseases would claim the lives of four of her siblings. Annie was destined, like many girls of her class, to go into service as a housemaid. Only when she married her mother\u2019s lodger, a coachman, did there come the promise of a better life. John Chapman (they shared a surname) was soon hired by a wealthy industrialist, the owner of a French-style chateau so grand it was let to the royal family for Ascot. With this job came a miracle in the form of a house. It had a kitchen, scullery, larder and three bedrooms, and it stood far from the stinking air of London, in open parkland. Annie, though, had a secret. She was a drinker, and for this she would pay a terrible price. Four of her eight babies lived for only days or weeks; a fifth was born with the symptoms of foetal alcohol syndrome; a sixth was paralysed. When her eldest daughter, Emily, died of scarlet fever, just as Annie\u2019s siblings had, her addiction took over. Following an unsuccessful spell in a sanatorium, in 1884 she was cast out by her husband; having long teetered on the edge of a precipice, she now toppled over it. Returning to London, she found herself homeless. Sometimes, she was protected by male companions: fellow drinkers with whom she could share a room in a dosshouse. Sometimes, she would stay for a night in the casual ward of a workhouse, picking oakum in exchange for a bed. And sometimes, she would sleep on the street. It was on the street that she died in 1888: the second \u201ccanonical\u201d victim of Jack the Ripper. An inventory of her possessions at the time of her death comprised just 13 items: in addition to her clothes and boots, she had about her person only a scrap of muslin, a comb and an envelope containing two pills. Annie\u2019s short and pitiable life is reconstructed in The Five, Hallie Rubenhold\u2019s devastatingly scrupulous account of the five women who were murdered in Whitechapel in 1888 \u2013 a work that last month won the \u00a350,000 Baillie Gifford prize. Critics often describe books as \u201clong overdue\u201d, but few histories have arrived as late in the day as this one: you could fill a library with titles, serious and spurious, dedicated to so-called Ripperology, yet not one of them would cover this territory. Turning resolutely away from the theories, the gore and the prurience, Rubenhold\u2019s achievement is two-fold. The Five is an immaculate work of social history, her accounts of Victorian workhouses, slums and brothels as vivid as any I\u2019ve ever read. But it\u2019s also a feminist act. Her simple care and exactitude in the matter of these women \u2013 her dogged refusal to accept that they were \u201conly prostitutes\u201d \u2013 restores their dignity and humanity, and in doing so exposes in the most powerful way the misogyny that has for so long been the repugnant, ever-whirring engine of the Ripper myth. What did these women have in common? Not prostitution, as Rubenhold shows (only two of them appear to have been paid for sex). In the end, it comes down to this: they were destitute, largely invisible and, at the time of their deaths, probably asleep. Alan Moore called his graphic novel about the Ripper From Hell. But if these women died in such a place, they had already long lived in it. As Rubenhold writes of Annie\u2019s end: \u201cWhat her murderer claimed on that night was simply all that remained of what the drink had left behind.\u201d Did the misapprehension of the police over the status of these women pervert the inquiry into their deaths? The answer to this question is almost certainly yes, just as it did a century later when Peter Sutcliffe was murdering women in Yorkshire. Then, as in Victorian times, a prostitute was all too often deemed to be a woman who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rubenhold dedicates her book to the five, and this seems right, for she has done them proud. Here is Polly Nichols, whose marital woes see her leaving her wondrous new Peabody flat and taking up \u201ctramping\u201d (she joins the 600 people who were then sleeping rough in Trafalgar Square); and here is Elizabeth Stride, an immigrant from Sweden on the run from a life that included, after she contracted syphilis while in service, regular inspections of her genitals by the authorities (her marriage and her business having failed she too takes to the streets, blagging for pennies). Kate Eddowes is the common-law wife of a pedlar, or chapman: a man who beats her, and cannot always afford to keep her; Mary Jane Kelly worked for a time in a Paris brothel, before fleeing to the squalor of the Ratcliffe Highway in Wapping. All their stories are profoundly sad. How thin is the line between respectability and disgrace, between survival and desperation. But still, they never quite reduced me to tears. Better to be angry than sad, I thought. Better to remember than to be allowed ever to forget. \u2022 The Five: The Untold Stories of the Women Killed By Jack the Ripper by Hallie Rubenhold is published by Transworld (\u00a316.99).
