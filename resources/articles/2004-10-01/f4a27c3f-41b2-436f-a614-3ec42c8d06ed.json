My lads have been together two or three weeks and Simon Walton was still at school 12 weeks ago. I had five players under 20 and they showed real guts. \"Some players would have crumbled under the pressure. I need the board to bring in some more players because that is all I've got at the moment and I don't want to push the young lads too hard too soon.\" Leeds became the latest side to discover that second-placed Reading - undefeated in seven games - are hardly suffering from vertigo and Steve Coppell, despite his side's domination, insisted he was not particularly disappointed with the result. \"I thought we created more than enough chances to win but it wasn't to be be,\" he said. \"I thought we played well and I'm not going to complain at just a point. There's only a cigarette paper between so many of the teams in this division and it's those margins that make the difference. We just couldn't get the right touch at the right moment.\" Lloyd Owusu bundled in a close-range equaliser to preserve Reading's unbeaten home run after Walton had given Leeds an early lead but Coppell was grateful to his goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann for a diving save to deny Brian Deane's injury-time header. The on-loan Brett Ormerod had crossed from the right wing for the unmarked Walton to give Leeds the lead. It was just the start they needed after scoring only one goal in their previous four games but they hardly threatened Reading again in the first half. After recovering from the initial shock Reading went on to dominate and the Leeds goalkeeper Neil Sullivan was kept regularly employed. He rushed from his line to block Shaun Goater's effort with his legs on 13 minutes and there was little respite as Glen Little's 24th-minute cross was headed down by Dave Kitson but Goater's shot was turned around the post. Reading equalised when Kitson's thumping header from Nicky Shorey's right-wing free-kick was pushed on to the post by Sullivan, only for the substitute Owusu to tuck home the rebound from a yard out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
