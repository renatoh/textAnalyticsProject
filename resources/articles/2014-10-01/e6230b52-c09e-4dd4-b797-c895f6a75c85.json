Seventy-five staff members from Texas Health Presbyterian hospital are being given a \u201cbinding legal document and order\u201d that states they will avoid public transport, not go to areas where large numbers of people congregate, and continue to be monitored twice a day for symptoms, county judge Clay Jenkins said on Thursday. Any of those involved in the care of Thomas Eric Duncan who refuse to sign the agreement would be subject to a legal control order, Jenkins told reporters after a meeting of the county commissioners court in downtown Dallas. \u201cAll the remedies of the law are available,\u201d he said. However he said he believed this would not be necessary. \u201cThese are hometown healthcare heroes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to jail.\u201d It was unclear how long the agreements would be in force. After first suggesting that all 75 healthcare workers had approved them, Jenkins conceded that the wording had only just been finalised, and that some of the 75 may have learned of it from watching broadcasts of the commissioners meeting. \u201cThis is clearly not the way I wanted it to go,\u201d he said. The healthcare workers will also have their home addresses flagged on the internal systems of emergency services, said Jenkins, adding that this would prompt first responders responding to calls from their houses to raise an alarm. The flags would disappear when they are no longer at risk of Ebola. The new measure was implemented amid sharp criticism over Amber Vinson, the second nurse to be diagnosed with Ebola after treating Duncan, being permitted to take commercial flights between Texas and Ohio despite already experiencing a fever. Vinson, 29, has been transferred to a facility in Atlanta for treatment. Nina Pham, the first nurse to be diagnosed, is being treated in Maryland. In all, more than 135 people \u2013 including the 75 healthcare workers, 48 other people who had contact with Duncan before he entered hospital, and a number of people Vinson encountered in Ohio \u2013 are being monitored for signs of Ebola. Jenkins announced the voluntary agreements after surprising the audience for the commissioners meeting by saying that he would not be declaring a state of emergency because of Ebola. A proposal for him to declare such an emergency was the sole stated reason for convening Thursday\u2019s emergency meeting. The proposal, published in advance awaiting Jenkins\u2019s signature, called for \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d necessary because Dallas \u201chas the potential to suffer widespread or severe damage, injury, loss or threat of life resulting from the Ebola virus.\u201d However, the motion was abruptly ignored and Jenkins announced the meeting had become \u201ca public discussion\u201d. \u201cAt this point we don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s necessary to take extraordinary powers, because we were able to do everything through our partnership with the city of Dallas, the state of Texas and the federal government,\u201d Jenkins said afterwards. Jenkins, who as county judge is the highest-ranking elected official in Dallas county, indicated that the decision had been taken following consultations with other officials including Rick Perry, the Republican governor of Texas, who returned from a visit to Europe to help deal with the situation. Referring to the wide-ranging powers that he would have been handed to control the movement of people into, out of and within the county, and to evacuate Dallas if necessary, Jenkins said: \u201cThat\u2019s not what America is about. I don\u2019t want those powers vested in me, and neither does Governor Perry.\u201d Jenkins chided the operators of the hospital for failing to prevent infections among its staff. He said he would begin working from inside the hospital in a unified command structure alongside Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials. \u201cThe buck has to stop with somebody, so the buck will stop with me,\u201d said Jenkins, amid ongoing complaints that no one figure has emerged to lead Dallas\u2019 response to the virus. Zachary Thompson, the county\u2019s health director, told the meeting that the voluntary agreements with the healthcare workers must \u201cgive the cities a comfort level that the 75 are contained\u201d, adding: \u201cWe need to be clear and transparent to the public that we don\u2019t hear a new number\u201d. Two of the four county commissioners signalled to the Guardian just hours before the meeting that they were in favour of the emergency declaration, which they said would also have made it easier for the county to obtain state and federal funding for its response to the crisis. \u201cThis is still evolving and the only way we can get reimbursed as a county is to make this declaration,\u201d said John Wiley Price, the commissioner for district three, who promptly backtracked once the meeting had begun following delays while the commissioners held discussions backstage. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we be reimbursed but that can\u2019t be my focus right now,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cPublic safety has to be priority number one\u201d. District four commissioner Dr Elba Garcia, whose chief of staff said before the meeting that she, too, wanted a state of emergency declared, said from the stage: \u201cAt this point I agree with Commissioner Price that the emergency declaration is a tool in the toolbox. I\u2019m going to be very honest with you: I was ready to vote for it. But I think we should put it back in the toolbox.\u201d Both Dr Theresa Daniel and Mike Cantrell, the other two county commissioners, along with Mike Rawlings, the mayor of Dallas, said from the stage that they agreed with the decision not to declare an emergency. Asked afterwards why the emergency meeting had been convened at all, Jenkins told reporters: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask the commissioners.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
