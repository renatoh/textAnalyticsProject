Police called Douglas Lindsell, 64, of Twickenham, \"the most prolific internet groomer ever caught\" and said his conversations with the girls were \"overtly sexual in nature\". Scotland Yard said Lindsell pretended to be a teenage boy in online teenager zones, allowing him to correspond with 54 girls in the UK. He compiled explicit sexual profiles of over 20 girls. Lindsell obtained private email addresses and mobile numbers to continue his \"grooming\" before arranging to meet two of his victims, aged 13 and 14, and attempting to entice them into his car. In some cases Lindsell, based on his conversations with young women, had researched the likely school they attended from their school uniforms. He then turned up at the school to try and find them, police said. Even after police arrested Lindsell and confiscated his computer as part of their investigation, he continued to contact the girls, trying to get them to delete emails and text messages that would identify him. One 14-year-old girl who Lindsell chatted to online described his approach: \"He was asking me lots of questions and what I looked like and what my school uniform was like. I didn't give him my number or anything, but I told him what my uniform was like and the colour and stuff. \"Then the police told me he went to my school's website and found my school on internet maps. He must have been trying to find me,\" she said. The girl's mother called for Lindsell and other like him to be locked away for life. \"My daughter is a bright young girl who is not easily led. However, despite my repeated warning to her over internet chatrooms, she was, for a while, taken in by this man. He befriended her at a vulnerable time in her life. Thankfully, she eventually saw him for what he is,\" she said. DCI Chris Watts of Twickenham police station said: \"Lindsell had a system of meeting, grooming and attracting young girls with a clear intent, and that was to commit an act of indecent assault. He was obsessive in his pursuit of underage girls, and continued to pursue them via an interactive cable channel which provided email facilities, after we had confiscated his computer. \"This story represents effective police intervention at an early stage. I believe that if Lindsell had not been caught when he was, it is extremely likely he would have proceeded to successfully abduct and assault children. As we have seen tragically on too many occasions in the past, this kind of behaviour can have the worst consequences,\" he added. In August, Lindsell pleaded guilty to the attempted abduction of a female child under 14 years, and perverting the course of justice. The perverting the course of justice charge related to Lindsell contacting victims and asking them to delete text messages and emails following his arrest. Lindsell further pleaded guilty to gross indecency towards a female child under 16 years of age, making indecent images of children, and two counts of sexual and threatening harassment of a girl. Eight indecent images of children were recovered from his computer. He pleaded not guilty to a further attempted abduction of a girl under 14 years old and to gross indecency towards girls under six years old. In addition to the five year prison sentence, Kingston crown court today placed Lindsell on the sex offenders register for 10 years, and placed him under a restraining order which prohibits any employment that would engage him in contact with children under the age of 16. MSN announced just last month that it was closing down its internet chatrooms in the UK in response to fears that paedophiles were preying on children online. Police are asking anyone who believes they may have encountered Lindsell before to contact the public protection unit at Twickenham police station on 020 8247 7014."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
