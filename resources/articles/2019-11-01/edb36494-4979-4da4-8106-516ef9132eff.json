Defeat by Norwich on Saturday prompted a brutal dismissal of the Everton manager by his own fans, who joined in with the away chants of \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning\u201d after Dennis Srbeny sealed a first win in eight matches for the team who started the day bottom of the Premier League. Bill Kenwright, the Everton chairman, was urged by a couple of supporters to sack Silva immediately after the game and he, Moshiri and Marcel Brands, the director of football, held talks with Silva afterwards. David Moyes and Mark Hughes have been discussed as replacements at boardroom level in recent weeks but having sacked Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Ronald Koeman and Sam Allardyce since investing in Everton in February 2016, Moshiri has wanted to stand by Silva as he seeks stability at Goodison Park. The hostility towards Silva makes that extremely unlikely, yet the Everton manager insists he can still win over increasingly disillusioned fans. \u201cI believe I can,\u201d Silva said. \u201cI believe in the work, I believe in our players and I believe in our fans. It is a normal reaction from the fans. I understand what you are asking me - unfortunately it is not something new at Everton. I am here to do my best every single day, to get the right result, and if we get the right results then you can repair things. It is everything about results and when we don\u2019t achieve them normally they [the fans] look for the person at the top and that is the manager.\u201d Everton are four points off the teams in the relegation zone and face a daunting run over the next few weeks against Leicester, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United. Silva said: \u201cWe cannot look for the next five games, we have to focus on the next one. We will focus on Leicester, nothing else. It will be a tough week with three games in six days but we have to look at each one in the right way. After the performance we had against Norwich, we have to react and react strong because it will take playing at a different level to get the points we want.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
