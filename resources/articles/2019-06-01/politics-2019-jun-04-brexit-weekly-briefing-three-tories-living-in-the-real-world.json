If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means podcast here. Top stories It\u2019s all about the Tory leadership, and (surprise, surprise) only three of the candidates to have declared are living in the real world. Matt Hancock, Rory Stewart and Sam Gyimah are saying the unsayable: no deal would be a catastrophe, and the EU will not renegotiate. Hancock, the health secretary, couldn\u2019t have been much plainer: \u201c\u2018No deal\u2019 is not a policy choice available to the next prime minister,\u201d he said. Stewart, the international development secretary, was equally blunt:\u201cStop pretending you are going to get alternative arrangements agreed by Brussels \u2018over the next few months\u2019. Stop. You won\u2019t. Admit it,\u201d he said. All the rest are busy telling Conservative members, 76% of whom favour a no-deal Brexit, that that\u2019s precisely what they\u2019re prepared to deliver if necessary. Among them, Andrea Leadsom promised it would be \u201cmanaged\u201d, something of an oxymoron. Dominic Raab is so gung-ho about no deal that a \u201cStop Raab\u201d campaign has been launched by Tory moderates, and Sajid Javid is also prepared to leave without a deal, ruling out a second referendum, general election or revoking article 50. Moderates are alarmed: Amber Rudd warned candidates against backing no deal; Philip Hammond said backing no deal would mean losing a no-confidence vote; Jeremy Hunt sought the middle line, saying he would back no deal \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d. UK manufacturers added their weight to the warnings, describing a no deal as \u201ceconomic lunacy\u201d following the news that British car production had plunged amid the \u201cuntold damage\u201d of the chaos surrounding Britain\u2019s exit date. Top scientists warned of a \u201cmajor blow\u201d to national science if ministers could not secure access to a vast EU research programme, and Elton John said he was ashamed of Britain and was \u201ca European, not a stupid, colonial, imperialist English idiot\u201d. After briefly attempting clarity on a second public vote, meanwhile, Labour appeared to backtrack somewhat, with Jeremy Corbyn saying a second referendum was \u201csome way off\u201d and that Labour still wanted to negotiate a better Brexit deal. What next Nothing has materially changed, so see last week\u2019s \u201cWhat next\u201d. Much could obviously depend on who becomes the the next Conservative leader and prime minister; my colleague Peter Walker has a useful look at the runners and riders \u2013 and their odds at the bookies. Best of the rest UK factory output shrinks on back of Brexit uncertainty More EU citizens are seeking help for stress and anxiety over Brexit Trouble brews at the court of King Corbyn Donald Trump: send in Nigel Farage to negotiate with the EU Conservative MP Phillip Lee loses vote of no confidence Brexit too complicated for referendum, says Jared Diamond UK consumer borrowing sees lowest rise since 2014 on Brexit fears EU citizens in UK at risk of Windrush-style catastrophe, say MPs EU chief negotiator blames Brexit on \u2018nostalgia for the past\u2019 John Bercow staying on as Speaker \u2018may not be enough to stop no-deal\u2019 EU promotes deputy Brexit negotiator to senior trade job Labour chair: some remainers are sneering at ordinary people EU students will not face Brexit penalty next year Top comments In the Guardian, Matthew d\u2019Ancona bemoans what Brexit has done to the Tory party: Tory members have drunk the Kool-Aid when it comes to Brexit: for them, it has ceased to be a geopolitical and commercial process and become a religion. Three-quarters of them favour a no-deal exit \u2013 far ahead of any other option. It is not just that they fear the Brexit party. They want to be the Brexit party. They long for the simplicity of Farage\u2019s demagoguery, the uncomplicated fervour of his rallies. After three years of parliamentary drudgery, they crave the politics of spectacle, excitement and tub-thumping vindication \u2026 It is extraordinary to think that, not so very long ago, the Conservatives considered themselves \u2013 with statistics on their side \u2013 as the \u201cnatural party of government\u201d. Now they more closely resemble a herd of lemmings, squeaking furiously about who should lead them to oblivion. How noisy the Tories have become, and how small. And the historian David Olusoga says Britain cannot be reborn while it is lost in fantasies of the past: If, on 31 October 2019, the fanatics and the Faragists win and we crash out of the EU, that moment, when the borders close, and the markets open, and the truth sinks in, will not be Britain\u2019s \u201cIndependence Day\u201d. A hard Brexit would be so damaging to the true interests of the UK that what might follow \u2013 if we are lucky \u2013 is a great unmasking, not just of the political fantasists and chancers who peddled the great Brexit swindle, but of the historical delusion that empowered them. The most extreme among the Brexiters are convinced they can ride the chaos and deploy the \u201cshock doctrine\u201d to remake the nation in their ideological image. But awoken from our dreamtimes by the smelling salts of economic reality, Britain might go the other way and begin the process that would see us start to decolonise our history and our self-image. Through such a process, Britain would, in effect, become the last country to leave the British empire. No matter what happens at Halloween, the dangers of England\u2019s dreaming are surely now clear and manifest.
