Guitarist Rowland \u201cBoon\u201d Gould, 64, was found dead at a friend\u2019s home in Uffculme, Devon, on 30 April this year. He had previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and told doctors he had suffered from depression all his life, the inquest in Exeter was told. The assistant Devon coroner Deborah Archer described Gould as a talented and much-loved musician. But she said: \u201cBoon had a difficult and complex history, which I find adversely affected his mental health. \u201cHe had coped with these issues sometimes without being completely open and honest with family and friends about the degree of suffering that he was going through.\u201d The coroner said Gould tried different types of therapy but did not find anything that consistently worked for him. She said this was likely due to his \u201cwish not to trouble others and the deep-seated nature of his problems, coupled with a tendency to self-medicate\u201d. Gould\u2019s wife, Moira, said her husband had been \u201copen\u201d about his mental health problems during their 17-year marriage. \u201cHe talked about how exhausting it was to be him,\u201d she told the inquest. \u201cHe had constant voices in his head. He had a constant internal battle.\u201d His wife described Gould as intelligent, modest and caring but eccentric and fun. Dr Clare Matthews, his family doctor, said Gould had a long history of mental health problems and alcoholism. The inquest heard Gould told doctors he consumed a bottle or half a bottle of whisky per day. \u201cHe became a successful guitarist and led a lifestyle characterised as heavy drinking, cocaine drug abuse and mental health problems, which ultimately led to him retiring from the music business in the 1990s,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cHe retired to move to Devon for a quieter life.\u201d Det Sgt Lucy Skinner, of Devon and Cornwall police, said Boon was last seen alive buying whisky and coke from a local shop on 27 April, three days before his body was found. The inquest heard that in the year before he died, he became agitated at being asked to do jury service. He caused damage at the family home and disappeared, sparking a police search. A post mortem concluded he died from hanging and there was a small amount of alcohol in his system. Charles Dixon, a psychiatrist, said Gould suffered mood swings all his adult life but that at times he felt invincible and would write songs in the middle of the night. After his death, Gould\u2019s brother and band member, Phil Gould, wrote that his heart was \u201cbeyond broken\u201d. The Level 42 vocalist Mark King described Gould as a \u201cdear friend and brother\u201d. The coroner concluded Gould had taken his own life.
