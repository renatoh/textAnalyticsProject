It was the teenaged \u201cBeatlemaniacs\u201d who supercharged a worldwide sensation and spent the money that fuelled the touring that fed the disaffection that led to the albums \u2013 like Revolver, Sgt Pepper\u2019s and The White Album \u2013 that allowed the band to carve out their niche as musical innovators. Tell that to Joe Beatles Fan as he guards his bootlegs like Smaug, however, and you\u2019ll likely be met with a sneer. Happily the delightful new documentary, I Used to Be Normal: A Boyband Fangirl Story, ignores what the Beatles became to many and focuses on what boy bands, including others such as One Direction, the Backstreet Boys and Take That, have meant to young women the world over. There\u2019s Elif, a girl in Long Island who pines for \u201cour boys\u201d (One Direction) as she wrestles with the expectations of her Turkish parents. In San Francisco, journalist Sadia maintains her Backstreet Boys fandom even though, in her mid-20s, she worries it\u2019s time to leave it behind. Sydney brand strategist Dara stealthily uses Take That\u2019s music to power her presentations at work. And in Melbourne, TV producer Susan fondly recalls how the Beatles helped her and her family through tough times. Director Jessica Leski and producer Rita Walsh allow these diverse and intergenerational women to weave their own stories. Filmed over five years, their individual narratives swerve in ways you may not initially expect given the upbeat topic of the documentary. Elif\u2019s story is particularly bittersweet. There was a time, during its successful Kickstarter campaign, when I Used to Be Normal looked set to be a far more prosaic look at boyband fandom: one featuring interviews with psychologists and pop culture experts, no doubt discussing just what it is that makes these young women so obsessed with the objects of their passionate affection. Thank god that\u2019s not how it turned out: if you\u2019ve seen one squirming interview with a psychologist about how girls had full-body orgasms at the Beatles\u2019 Shea Stadium show (etc) you\u2019ve seen them all. Stripped of pathologising (or, worse, legitimising) context, this film becomes something far more poetic. In this way, it is quietly (occasionally, explicitly) feminist; the interviewees wrestle with societal and familial expectations, sexuality, and the question of growing up while maintaining a passion firmly believed to be something only teenagers should indulge in. But as Susan says, seeing her Beatlemaniac experience reflected in the 1D mania of 2015, our society is so desperately empty of opportunities for catharsis and where better to let rip than at a boyband show? (Or, as Elif recalls, at the mall during a signing.) Charming animated sequences illustrate the interviewees\u2019 fanciful dreams (some of them literal) about their boyband heroes, including Dara\u2019s teenaged belief that if she learned all the moves of a particular Take That concert VHS tape, she could be called upon to understudy if one of the blokes fell ill or needed the night off. Anyone who has ever loved a band so much it made them cry will see aspects of themselves in the film\u2019s \u201cfangirls\u201d. As a young teen in 1995, AKA the Anthology era, I fell in love with the Beatles for the first time. (If it was painful falling in love with the band when they were only a few years older than you and, thus, potentially your actual boyfriend, I can assure you it was a nightmare to discover them when they were granddads \u2013 or, in John\u2019s case, dead.) When I heard that the local primary school had a badge-making machine set up for its fete, I sprinted to the nearest photocopier and returned to the fete with Fab Four imagery daubed hastily with glitter to make my own Beatles badges for the princely sum of $2 per badge. Sadia draws a line from her teenaged BSB newsletter and website to her journalistic career. I once ran an Angelfire site for Gomez (the non-threateningly boyish English jam band I\u2019m sure were a gateway drug into so-called legitimate music for many boyband fangirls) that led directly to my first published article. It was a fact I used to be mortally embarrassed by, but I Used to Be Normal reassured me. As Dara says, reflecting on the formerly closely held secret of her Take That obsession, \u201cNormal to me sounds boring. It just sounds like there are no big major choruses in that world if you\u2019re normal. And what\u2019s life without a big major chorus?\u201d \u2022 I Used to Be Normal: A Boyband Fangirl Story is in Australian cinemas now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
