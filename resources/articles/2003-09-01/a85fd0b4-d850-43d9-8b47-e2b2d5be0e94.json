She was the first black player to win Wimbledon and the US Championship and her entry at Forest Hills in 1950 had also been historic, Gibson becoming the first black American to play in what is now the US Open. Prior to that tennis was a largely segregated sport in the US and Gibson's first appearance was dramatic. In the third round she played the third seed, Louise Brough, the reigning Wimbledon champion, and came within one game of winning. Gibson, having initially been gripped with nerves, was leading 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 when a rain storm struck and the match was held over for another day, when Brough won three straight games. Gibson, strong and very athletic, grew up in Harlem. Her family were poor but she came to the attention of Dr Walter Johnson, a physician who was active in the black tennis community. He became her patron and mentor, as he was later for Arthur Ashe, the 1975 Wimbledon men's champion. Through Johnson the young Gibson was given expert tuition and the opportunity to play tournaments, and she would undoubtedly have come to prominence earlier had it not been for segregation. Gibson was 30 by the time she won the first of two successive US championships in 1957, and she was also Wimbledon champion in those same two years. Previously she had won her first major title at Roland Garros in 1956, defeating Britain's Angela Mortimer 6-0, 12-10 in the final. In all she won 11 grand slam titles in singles and doubles as an amateur before turning professional after winning her second US singles champi onship. She was never completely at ease in amateur circles, realising that despite her success she remained unwelcome at certain clubs, although a mark of her general acceptance in a predominantly white sport came in 1957 when she was selected for the US in their Wightman Cup team against Britain. That same year she was named US Woman Athlete of the Year. Gibson was a big hitter with a huge serve. She loved to attack but proved on the clay in Paris that she had the patience and technique to win from the baseline. It was in doubles that she became the first black player to win a Wimbledon title, taking the doubles alongside Angela Buxton in 1956. Once she had turned professional she took part in a series of head-to-heads against Karel Fageros of the US. Their matches were played in con junction with the Harlem Globetrotters, the tennis coming before the basketball and played on the same court. Gibson said she earned more than $100,000 in one year from her share of the gates but there was no professional tour for women in those days. She turned to professional golf and then in 1968, when the Open era began, returned to play a few tennis events; but age had caught up with her. She was married briefly to WA Darben and worked as a teaching pro after stopping playing. Gibson was inducted into the US Tennis Hall of Fame in 1971 and took a keen interest in the rise of the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, both of whom have achieved wealth beyond her dreams. \"In sports you simply are not considered a real champion until you have defended your title successfully,\" Gibson said in 1958 after winning both the US and Wimbledon titles for a second time. \"Winning it once can be a fluke; winning it twice proves you are the best. I was passionately determined that there wasn't going to be any 'one-shot' tarnish on my Wimbledon championship.\" \u00b7 Justine Henin-Hardenne looks favourite to finish 2003 as world No1 despite suffering a rude defeat in yesterday's Sparkassen Cup final. Henin lost 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 to Anastasia Myskina, although a much more significant outcome was that she moved to within 300 ranking points of Kim Clijsters' top spot, a deficit Henin can eliminate next week if she takes away her compatriot's title at the Porsche Grand Prix in Germany. Meanwhile Taylor Dent, ranked 54th in the world, claimed a major upset in beating the world No1 Carlos Ferrero 6-3, 7-6 to win the Thailand Open in Bangkok."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
