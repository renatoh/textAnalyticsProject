The trouble started when several thousand Birmingham supporters invaded the pitch at the final whistle and confronted the 3,800 Villa fans located at the opposite end of the ground. Police formed a cordon to prevent the two sets of supporters clashing and a flare was launched by the Birmingham fans in the corner of the Kop stand into the adjacent visiting end. The Villa supporters then threw the flare towards the Birmingham fans on the pitch as police struggled to restore order. Plastic seats were ripped out and the skirmishes continued outside the ground. Afterwards police said 14 people, including four police officers, required hospital treatment for minor injuries and two police dogs were injured after being struck by missiles. A pub near the ground, along with parked cars, suffered damage and there were five arrests. \"This incident must have been very frightening for the vast majority of spectators,\" said Steve Graham, the match-day commander. With England waiting to learn whether their bid to host the 2018 World Cup will be successful, the timing could hardly be worse. The Football Association issued a statement, strongly condemning the actions of those involved and promising a full investigation into scenes that were a similar feature when the clubs last met under floodlights, in the 2002-03 season. West Midlands police had been concerned that another evening kick-off might provoke problems and their fears were realised despite the presence of up to 500 officers. Birmingham have promised to launch their own investigation and it seems inevitable they will be fined. An FA spokesperson said: \"We wholly condemn the actions of any individuals who have been involved in the scenes of disorder. The FA abhors acts of violent behaviour and we urge the clubs and authorities to identify any individuals involved in disorder and impose the stiffest sanctions, including banning orders. \"The FA will fully investigate the matter. The whole of English football has worked hard to eradicate scenes of disorder from our game, with Home Office figures this week showing a significant drop in arrests at the many thousands of football matches held every week, the majority of which still pass trouble free.\" McLeish admitted that the actions of the troublemakers had \"soured\" the night for his players, who were denied the chance to celebrate a first win over their city rivals since 2005. \"That was horrible to see the punters running on the pitch \u2013 it's from the dark ages that,\" he said. \"We don't condone that at all. I know we have not beaten Villa for a while, and the fans were treating it like a cup final. But when you see flares being thrown into the crowd it's not something you want to be associated with. Fans shouldn't come on to the pitch at any time; that's the disappointing aspect, and that sours it a bit for me. \"I don't think that will affect the World Cup bid. I am sure that has already been decided and let's hope England get it.\" One Aston Villa fan told Radio 5 Live that holding the match in the evening was \"a recipe for disaster\" and criticised the stewarding, saying: \"Sitting above the Villa fans were Birmingham fans. My 11-year-old-son was spat on repeatedly and no action was taken.\" Birmingham City said it did \"not tolerate the breaking of any stadium rules and will conduct a full investigation in conjunction with the FA and police, and take appropriate action. A meeting will be held at St Andrew's on Thursday [today] to investigate the matter further.\" The club's acting chairman Peter Pannu added: \"I promise there will be an impartial investigation by the club.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
