Around the coffin-shaped table sat the seven people who will be in overall charge of Britain's military campaign against Iraq. In the background stalked the all but inevitable view that this week will see the start of the second Gulf war. Blair, Chancellor Gordon Brown, John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, and Sir David Manning, the Prime Minister's chief foreign affairs adviser, discussed the material that would be taken to this morning's last-ditch summit in the Azores with President George Bush. Alongside them, Sally Morgan, Director of Government Relations, Alastair Campbell, Director of Strategy and Communications, and John Reid, former Northern Ireland Secretary and chairman of the Labour Party, discussed the preparations for conflict. During the week they will be joined by Jonathan Powell, No 10 Chief of Staff, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff, Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, and Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary. This will be Blair's core team. During the two-hour meeting yesterday morning, the grimness of the situation became apparent. Diplomatic prospects were described as 'bleak'. The cabinet agreed that the United Nations will be given a further 24 hours from the end of the Azores summit tonight to discuss the second resolution. Saddam must comply with the six tests 'within a handful of days', Number 10 officials said this weekend. If they cannot get agreement with the UN, then diplomacy has finally failed. There will then be a step change. No more late-night meetings discussing complicated wording. No more arm-twisting around the corridors of the UN headquarters in New York. If the resolution falls, the first phase of Shock and Awe, the working title for the military campaign, will begin. Ministry of Defence officials then say that action will follow in 'short order'. 'All the ducks are in a row,' said one MoD source. 'We can go, it is now a political decision and, when it comes to it, it will all happen very quickly.' In a matter of days? 'In a matter of days.' Blair knows that he is at the tipping point. Once the UN route is abandoned, the logic of the position of the United States and Britain means that events will tumble one after another. The Prime Minister has already pencilled in an emergency Cabinet meeting either for Monday evening or Tuesday morning. He will tell the Cabinet that all diplomatic routes have been exhausted. He will say that now is the time for action. With no second resolution, Number 10 officials believe that Robin Cook, the Leader of the House of Commons, will resign. They say they are still hopeful that Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, can be kept on board. The publication of the 'road map' to a Palestinian state by 2005 has abated some of her anger about the 'push for war'. The last, final summit on a group of islands in the east Atlantic has also helped. Hillary Armstrong, the Chief Whip, who also met Blair yesterday morning, is planning to announce a vote in the Commons on military action on Tuesday afternoon. Earlier plans that Blair would green-light action before giving Parliament a say have been abandoned as too politically risky. 'Everyone knows that, if the UN route fails and Saddam does not comply, then there is only one route left open,' said a senior figure inside Number 10. 'To suggest that we somehow try and sneak the troops in before giving the Commons a vote is wide of the mark. With the proviso, as Tony has always said, that he will not do anything that could jeopardise the safety of British forces, he wants the Commons to be able to express an opinion.' Around government talk of timetables and scenarios comes the obvious caveat: things change. One Whitehall official reminds colleagues on a regular basis of the Stingray call to arms: 'Anything could happen in the next half-hour.' This time, though, the die appears cast. After a working breakfast with key officials, Blair will fly from Heathrow today bound for the Azores. The British Airways 777 will take just over four hours to reach the Portuguese islands. With him will be Manning, Powell, Morgan and Campbell. Flying overnight in the other direction will come Air Force One, Bush's private plane. The President and the Prime Minister will meet for six hours. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, Spain's Prime Minister, will also arrive from Madrid. The three key members of the 'coalition of the willing' will discuss the diplomatic options. Blair and Bush will discuss tactics. This time last week Blair thought he was close to getting at least a form of UN backing. He had told colleagues over the weekend that, if America and Britain could get nine of the 15 Security Council members on board, then they would have a 'moral majority' whether France or Russia used their veto or not. The whole diplomatic effort has centred on the 'undecided six' on the Security Council - Angola, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico, Chile and Pakistan - known as U6 to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, British Ambassador to the UN. At the beginning of the week the African states had all signalled that they would back a second resolution with the six tests. While America worked on Pakistan, dangling the possibility of $1 billion (\u00a3650 million) of aid and a waiver of all sanctions imposed after the 1999 military coup, Britain worked on Chile. Blair spoke to Ricardo Lagos, the President, in a series of lengthy phone calls. Although Lagos admitted that he was not 'quite on the same page' as the US and Britain, he was willing to sign up to an ultimatum. With the six acting as a block, Mexico also suggested agreement as long as the timing of the deadline could be discussed. General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's leader, told Bush in a telephone conversation that Pakistan could be pushed towards a 'yes' vote if the rest of the undecided group were on board. 'At one stage we thought we had ten votes,' said one key No 10 official. 'And then came Chirac.' On Monday night Jacques Chirac, the President of France, said in a television interview that he would use the French veto against any resolution which gave Saddam an ultimatum 'whatever the circumstances'. Britain had yet to announce its six tests and, as far as the British Government was concerned, France was acting to scupper the negotiations before they had even begun. Although France claims that it is still open to negotiations, Chirac's intervention threw the UN route off the rails. 'As soon as that happened we knew there were real problems,' the key Number 10 aide said. A diplomatic source said that the move had 'changed the atmospherics'. Chirac had made it clear he would not be bounced into military conflict. Dominique de Villepin, the French Foreign Secretary, also said on Newsnight on Friday that the undecided six would not be allowed to dictate policy. 'They do not seem to be prepared to let the U6 take responsibility,' a Whitehall source said. 'That is both arrogant and an affront to multilateralism.' France was to blame, the Government briefed. Russia, China, Syria and Germany were also against. America was getting impatient. 'This has gone on long enough,' said Condoleezza Rice, Bush's National Security Adviser, in an interview with al-Jazeera, the Arab television network, on Friday. When the undecided six tabled a last-ditch compromise by suggesting a three-week deadline, their delegation had got less than 100 yards from their meeting rooms towards the UN council chamber to distribute the new draft before Ari Fleischer had dismissed it as a 'non-starter'. At one of the final meeting of the Security Council ambassadors in New York on Wednesday, an increasingly desperate Greenstock pleaded with members to find some middle ground. He compared the British resolution to a badly damaged ship that would sink 'unless extreme measures are taken'. The problem was no one seemed willing to take them. George Bush and Tony Blair have spoken on the telephone every day for the last week. On Wednesday afternoon, Bush asked the British Prime Minister if it was time to convene the pre-war summit which had been discussed before but never finalised. Blair agreed as long as it was characterised as a 'last push for peace'. Officials started working frantically on arranging the trip to the Azores. Staff at the White House are already working on a 'declaration of war' speech to be made by the President within hours of a defeat on the Security Council or a decision not to put the motion to a vote at all. The speech, said sources, would herald 'an end to diplomacy' and alert UN inspectors, aid workers and other foreigners to quit Iraq. If the motion is put, sources say that, although it will carefully avoid a deadline, the Bush administration is not prepared to see any diplomatic discussion beyond 28 March. It is now looking increasingly likely that Blair will be forced to sell a position to Britain that he hoped never to find himself in - military action without the backing of a second resolution. A political blitz to try to keep those nervous of such a move will start this morning, with Brown appearing on the BBC's Breakfast with Frost to make the Government's case. Brown is becoming Blair's war weapon of choice. After a tense 70-minute Cabinet on Thursday morning in which Cook made clear his reservations about government policy, Brown and Campbell spoke about the strategy to be put before the public. Campbell asked the Chancellor if he would be ready for a round of interviews to back the Prime Minister's position. By that lunchtime he had spoken to almost every major media outlet. 'Gordon has a different purchase on the party to Tony's,' said one government official. 'If he is out there making the arguments, then no one can say that Blair is leading a reluctant Cabinet.' Pushing his plum and fennel tart around the plate in a private dining room at the Cinnamon Club, Westminster's smartest Indian restaurant, a shirt-sleeved John Reid was choosing his words carefully on Thursday lunchtime. Events were moving so fast that even the Labour Party chairman risked falling behind: even as he defended Britain's suggestion that Saddam appear on television to admit to having chemical weapons, Sky News was elsewhere announcing that the condition was being dropped. As Reid must have known, it was always designed as what the Foreign Office calls a 'strip-away', a negotiating clause - added only so that it can be removed in an apparent show of compromise. But Reid's audience of just over a dozen women journalists was more interested in the two potential Cabinet 'strip-aways', Short and Cook. He did not, he repeatedly stressed, want to get into any personal criticism of her. But if he had had doubts himself about Blair's policy on Iraq? 'If I believed we were making a terrible mistake, I would take the honourable action and just walk.' And should Cook have been seen more often pushing the case for military action? Reid paused. 'I'm sure he's very busy,' he deadpanned. Cook and Short may be poised to resign this week, but government loyalists are beginning to draw clear distinctions between them. It may be Short who apparently burnt her boats most conclusively by accusing the Prime Minister publicly of recklessness, but it is the resolutely silent Cook who is seen as more set on going. At one point Ministers feared he might quit on Friday. The government campaign to keep those considering voting against Blair on Tuesday onside has already started. 'There have been threats that people will lose their jobs,' said Graham Allen, Nottingham MP and a leading figure among those seeking to launch a rebel amendment against the Government. 'They are telling people that the PM needs their loyalty. People are being put in a very difficult position.' Allen, Chris Smith, the former Culture Secretary who led the last rebellion, and Peter Kilfoyle, the former Defence Secretary, will put down an amendment to the Government's position; 200 MPs could rebel. A number of Ministers below Cabinet rank are likely to resign. 'We will have to word it very carefully,' Allen said. 'If we are on the brink of committing British troops to conflict, then clearly we have to support them. But that doesn't mean we support the policy that has led to this.' The mood at Westminster is changing, after threats from leftwingers last week to use the Iraq crisis as a springboard to challenge the Prime Minister. 'There are enough people in the Parliamentary Labour Party [PLP] who recognise that they owe their seats to Tony as much as anything else,' said one loyalist. Wednesday morning's meeting of the PLP was, he said, stuffed with MPs in marginal seats who had suddenly begun warning of the need to rally round Blair. As Blair sets off for the Azores today, he is a Prime Minister on the brink of military conflict. There could be a rebellion at home. In the international arena fundamental splits appear inevitable. Blair knows that his reputation is on the line."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
