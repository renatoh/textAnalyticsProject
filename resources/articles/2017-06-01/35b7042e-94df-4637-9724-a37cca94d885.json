Bill Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh, fired back after Trump referenced the city in his speech defending the White House\u2019s decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord. \u201cI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,\u201d Trump said, speaking in the White House rose garden on Thursday. Peduto seized on the comment, countering that Pittsburgh voted for Trump\u2019s opponent, Hillary Clinton, during the 2016 presidential election. \u201cFact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPittsburgh stands with the world and will follow Paris agreement.\u201d He continued: \u201cAs the mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris agreement for our people, our economy and future.\u201d The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, an outspoken critic of Trump, chimed in. \u201cOnce again Donald Trump is wrong,\u201d Hidalgo said on Twitter. \u201cParis and Pittsburgh do stand together for the Paris agreement.\u201d During his remarks, Trump also referenced Youngstown, Ohio, and Detroit, Michigan, as examples of cities that would benefit from America\u2019s departure from the Paris accord. Like Pittsburgh, both cities are located in counties that Clinton won easily. Peduto is one of several US mayors who have committed to enforce the tenets of the climate accord, despite Trump\u2019s decision to join Nicaragua and Syria as the only countries not party to the agreement. In a statement, the US Conference of Mayors said that it strongly opposes leaving the Paris agreement, and called on the nation\u2019s mayors to continuing fighting climate change by committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cThe US Conference of Mayors is a strong proponent of the need to address climate change and we support the Paris agreement, which positions the world\u2019s nations, including the United States, to be energy independent, self-reliant, and resilient,\u201d Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton, chair of the conference\u2019s environment committee, said in a statement. \u201cA thriving economy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are compatible by focusing on new technology, investing in renewable fuel sources, and increasing our energy efficiency.\u201d Barack Obama, whose administration spent years painstakingly negotiating the terms of the Paris climate agreement, said leaving the accord is an abdication of US leadership on the global stage. But in the absence of a national commitment, Obama said \u201cour states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we\u2019ve got\u201d. On Thursday, 61 mayors said they would independently adopt the Paris accord, according to Climate Mayors, a network of 88 mayors that sent a letter to Trump in March opposing his actions on climate change. \u201cWe will continue to lead,\u201d the mayors said in a statement. \u201cIf the president wants to break the promises made to our allies enshrined in the historic Paris agreement, we\u2019ll build and strengthen relationships around the world to protect the planet from devastating climate risks,\u201d they said. \u201cThe world cannot wait \u2013 and neither will we.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
