United\u2019s manager addressed Maguire\u2019s poor form as it emerged the club had triggered the one-year extension on Paul Pogba\u2019s contract, which was due to expire at the end of this season. The move protects the value of the midfielder, who has said a transfer to Real Madrid would be a \u201cdream\u201d. Maguire was part of a United rearguard routed 6-1 by Tottenham in the final league game before the international break and he then received a red card in England\u2019s 1-0 defeat by Denmark at Wembley, being shown a second yellow on 31 minutes. It is rare for Solskj\u00e6r to volunteer information on any player\u2019s injury but he said Maguire sustained an unspecified problem with England. There have been suggestions it would be in the interest of Maguire and United for the player to be rested. \u201cWhen Harry [helps] beat No 1 ranked Belgium it\u2019s a normal day [yet] you get the headlines when you get a sending-off,\u201d the manager said. \u201cHarry has got great resilience, he wants to play and work his way [away from] the last couple of games for which he\u2019s been criticised. [But] he picked up a knock just before he came [was sent] off. We\u2019ll have a look at him today.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r will not take a unilateral decision to give Maguire a break. \u201cHe\u2019s a lad who doesn\u2019t want to hide behind a red card or a bad performance; he wants to go out there and prove himself,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it\u2019s up to me to choose him or not and if I want to take him out [of] the firing line. I haven\u2019t considered that without him coming to knock on my door. I speak to him regularly and he\u2019s been very positive in his communication.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r batted away a question about Pogba\u2019s latest voicing of admiration for Real and confirmed the extension to the 27-year-old\u2019s deal. \u201cPaul\u2019s our player, he\u2019s going to be here for another two years and sure he\u2019s focused on doing his best for us,\u201d he said. Solskj\u00e6r drew scrutiny for his decision to withdraw Bruno Fernandes at half-time against Spurs. There were suggestions the playmaker was unhappy at this, yet the manager said: \u201cBruno has lost two league games and came here in February. [But] it\u2019s been two in quick succession. He\u2019s not used to losing league games but welcome to Manchester United \u2013 this is what happens. [Elements are] going to try to create a division between us. But it\u2019s not going to happen; this is a group that wants to work together and stick together.\u201d United, along with Liverpool, were drivers of the doomed Project Big Picture plan that would have supported the EFL and cemented power with the biggest clubs. Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cIt\u2019s a definite that we, as one of the bigger clubs, have a responsibility to protect the football pyramid and smaller clubs. We have seen lately the effect this pandemic has had. The key thing is we want fans back in stadiums, which will help other clubs, so I\u2019m just glad talks have started.\u201d Facundo Pellistri and Edinson Cavani are not available to face Newcastle but Alex Telles, another deadline-day signing, could be in the squad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
