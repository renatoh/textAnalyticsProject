That's part of what's called the New Dimension scheme, based on the realisation in Britain that the attack America suffered in 2001 was a new dimension in scale and type of incident. The scheme means us planning to cope with an intentional action that inflicts a lot of casualties. If you add in any chemical or biological element, or radiological or nuclear, then the implications for contaminating an area . . . it clearly has put it in a complete new dimension. Under New Dimension the government has allocated \u00a353m to the fire service so we can carry out mass decontamination if the need arises due to a chemical or radiological attack. We have additional capital bids for urban search and rescue equipment. I think we should be open to the public, to let them know what we're doing, but also what their part is. People should go on with their normal lives - of course I travel on the underground when I'm in London - but not ignore the things around them. More than any time we do rely on a vigilant local population: you know your own area, so you know if something doesn't look right: people, vehicles, or whatever. That vigilance is really important. The whole point is to give the emergency services as much time as possible to respond if something is brewing. I have been criticised as being too open, and giving too much terminology out; the concern in the United Kingdom is, 'You'll alarm people'. What I'm saying is give the public the information. Familiarisation will give them the confidence, knowing they're in good hands. The United States has education in schools about what to do in the event of natural disasters. I'm keen on seeing public education in this country, particularly with regard to CBRN types of issues and threats [chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear]. What mass decontamination would actually involve if we had to carry it out, for example, so people understand the processes they'd be put through and why, as they are in America. What is actually being developed now by the Cabinet Office - specifically, by the government information and communications part of the Civil Contingencies Secretariat - is an education programme so the public would know what to do in these eventualities. Which I fully support. For example, if a contaminant requires quick removal, the fastest things you can get to the scene are fire appliances lined in parallel using hosereels. it's rather rudimentary but for speed that is what's needed. People in these situation are afraid and they want to get away from the scene. But if you can get across to them, whether TV ads or mailshots, that it's important to remove the decontaminant not just for themselves but for other people, then they can see the necessity of going through that operation. There is no law that forces people to remain in an inner cordon. They need to have confidence in the measures so they will remove themselves from the area through a process where they will be derobed, decontaminated, rerobed, medically examined, and then they can move on to reception centres or out of the zone. If they have an appreciation of that, people will comply. I realise that aside from health there are also cultural issues: for some people it would be very drastic to remove their clothing in public. There's also the elderly. We're trying to address that: the units we're purchasing provide warm water in closed areas so people can go through a dignified process. We're looking at processes of segregating people so they go through this process with a high level of dignity; men, women, children of all ages. It's a bit like when you go into hospital. You're committing yourself to the people there you get you better. 'It takes time' I also want people to know what is being done in emergency planning: that there is training and education for those that have to respond in emergencies; we are analysing CBRN types of substances that could be used; there is equipment being purchased. This equipment has got to be tested to see that it can perform to the standards - there are fightfighters' lives involved - and that takes time. It also takes time to develop detection equipment; we wanted the best. That's what's going on behind the scenes. And behind the emergency services sit the local authorities where there's also work going on. What happened on September 11 of 2001, I'd say there's no country in the world would have been prepared any better than the United States for such a catastrophic event. We were looking at issues of CBRN before September 11. I was already going to meetings with the Home Office on that - the sarin attack on the Tokyo underground in 1995 highlighted how that type of incident can occur. But September 11 made us look at our procedures because of those twin towers actually collapsing, and the loss of life of the public and of the rescue workers. It also made us review the deployment of fire service staff, and what we've got to do to equip ourselves and make the rescue workers as safe as possible. What we've done has made those uncertainties less than they were. For all this work of course you need funding. In America the federal government pours a lot of money in to emergency preparations through the Federal Emergency Management Agency - principally because the US has lots of natural disasters like tornadoes in the east and earthquakes in the west. But there are flaws when it comes to response in the US: there has been confusion at the scene between the police fire and ambulance, partly because of various tiers of administration I suppose. In this country we have got clear demarcation and it's understood who's in command. If we have a fire in this country or a terrorist incident, the agency in overall coordination is the police - though at the centre of the incident (be it a large fire or where there is large contamination) you have the fire service, because they have the personal protective equipment to go in. When that fire is controlled or lapsing, the police still have coordination because they may be examining it as the scene of a crime. And when they leave the local authority comes in, they've got to rebuild that area. And you can't just rebuild what was there, because people have lost lives. I've been very much involved with the Cabinet Office in establishing the foundations for the new Civil Contingencies Bill. Most of us in this field would like emergency planning to be put on a statutory basis - not just for its funding, but so that emergency preparedness is mandatory for all organisations. It has to be across the board, because you cannot plan in isolation. At the moment there is no regulation to say local authorities or any other agency has to plan. There was always the idea of creating a statutory duty, but a lot of the problem was finding the time and parliamentary commitment to push that through. Since September 11 there is that commitment. There's a lot of impetus on that bill on the part of ministers and by Sir David Omand [security and intelligence coordinator and permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office]. I think we'll see this bill come to fruition this year. I think this bill is vital. - Brian Ward trained as an aeronautical engineer and has supervised heavy maintenance of aircraft fleets in Britain and overseas.
