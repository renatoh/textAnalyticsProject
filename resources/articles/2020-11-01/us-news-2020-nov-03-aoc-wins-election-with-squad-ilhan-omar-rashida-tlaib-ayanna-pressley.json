Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan will return to their seats in the US Congress. The four women of color, who championed ambitious climate action, healthcare for all Americans and other progressive causes while enduring frequent racism and derision from Donald Trump, will no longer be newcomers to Capitol Hill. \u201cOur sisterhood is resilient,\u201d Omar tweeted. \u201cServing New York-14 and fighting for working-class families in Congress has been the greatest honor, privilege and responsibility of my life,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cThank you to the Bronx and Queens for re-electing me to the House despite the millions spent against us, and trusting me to represent you once more.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez had been expected to easily win re-election, but like other congressional Democrats was watching hopes that the party would expand their majority wane. After Republicans flipped two House seats in Miami-Dade county \u2013 where a majority of the voters are Latino \u2013 she lamented that Democrats and Joe Biden had not done more to galvanize Latino voters. \u201cTonight\u2019s results \u2026 are evolving and ongoing,\u201d the New Yorker wrote, \u201cbut I will say we\u2019ve been sounding the alarm about Democratic vulnerabilities with Latinos for a long, long time. There is a strategy and a path, but the necessary effort simply hasn\u2019t been put in. \u201cWe have work to do.\u201d In a message to supporters, Pressley said: \u201cTogether, we have fought for our shared humanity. We have organized. We have mobilized. We have legislated our values. I am so proud to be your congresswoman and your partner in the work. I believe in the power of us. And we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d Tlaib, who with Omar was one of the first two Muslim women to be elected to Congress two years ago, tweeted congratulations to Pressley. \u201cThe Squad is big,\u201d she said. Trump has frequently vilified all four congresswomen, and in the lead-up to election day lobbed frequent xenophobic attacks at Omar \u2013 accusing her at a recent rally of telling \u201cus\u201d \u2013 his overwhelmingly white audience \u2013 \u201chow to run our country\u201d. Omar came to the US at the age of 12, after fleeing civil war in Somalia. When she was first elected in 2018, she became the first woman of color to represent Minnesota in Congress. The president has also often singled out Ocasio-Cortez as a radical, socialist voice in the Democratic party. Although her seat in New York\u2019s Bronx and Queens was never competitive, she raised more than $17m for her re-election campaign. Her challenger, Republican John Cummings, raised about $9.5m \u2013 and a group called the \u201cStop AOC Pac\u201d spent more than half a million dollars on ads opposing the congresswoman. Other progressive representatives who have won re-election include Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin. And the progressives Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri are headed to Congress for the first time, after winning their respective elections."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
