What larks; two of the finest cricketers of this or any other era, not playing in the match, and mucking in with the menial tasks. It reminded me of those charity dinners where the hoi polloi pay for the privilege of being waited upon by the likes of a pouting Natasha Kaplinsky. Jolly good, it's all supposed to be part of the team ethos. We are, they are saying, all in this together; superstars we might be, but no job is beneath us in the team cause. Besides, it helps to stave off the boredom when you're not playing. It is an easy thing for players of their status, but put yourself in the boots of England's Jon Lewis earlier in the season. Here we had a player within a whisker of representing his country in a Test match until the selectors intervened, condemning him to the sort of role for which, instead of a central contract or a match fee worth thousands of pounds, he could be paid \u00a34.50 an hour plus tips. Personally, I think this is rather demeaning. You do not, for instance, see David Beckham dishing out the half-time oranges. This, remember, is the age when every player's whim is catered for under the broad umbrella of Team England. So, it should not be outside the remit to employ someone for the specific task of carrying the bottles of isotonic fluid replacement drinks that are conveyed to bowlers and fielders every other over. It would at least leave the player who has been omitted with some remaining shred of self-respect. I wonder at what stage the traditional drinks break in hot weather was replaced by what is, in effect, a running bar? Gradually, would be my answer and probably through the 1980s. There was a time when part of the physical process of bowling, and indeed fielding, was the ability to get through sessions before the relief of drinks. It was desperately hard work at times, especially abroad. Playing in Sri Lanka, with not just the temperature but the humidity as well, could be purgatory. Once, during a match I played in Hyderabad (the city in the Sind desert of Pakistan) the supply of bottled water, which had been following the team around in a lorry, went missing en route. We played an entire match on good old e-numbered Fanta. On another occasion - again abroad - a headache (probably caused by dehydration now I come to think about it) necessitated a couple of painkillers. I called for aspirin and a glass of water. One of the umpires seized the water, poured all but an inch away and grandly announced that I was allowed \"minimum water only\". Nowadays you would sue. What happens now, even if it appears an excessive indulgence, is absolutely the right thing to do; I would never try to suggest otherwise. Constant rehydration is essential, the medical people, not to mention common sense, tell you so. If you feel thirsty, then it is already too late. This is why a fast bowler will be sipping on the teat of a Gatorade bottle (that's an avenue down which the psychologists might like to wander) having been on the field barely five minutes. However, it has meant that one element of the physical ordeal has long since disappeared as a result. Further to that, if the effort being put in is now that precise to ensure that a team performs at its best, is there any longer a justification for not, after selecting the squad, actually incorporating the finest all-round fielder in the land? Gary Pratt from Durham took the field yesterday, but why should it not have been the phenomenal Paul Collingwood? Increasingly, success or otherwise in sport is dependent on the small percentages adding up: witness Michael Vaughan's running out of Damien Martyn yesterday. Getting the best possible fielders into play would seem to be fundamental. When ECB snubbed BBC You may have noticed the advertising hoarding publicising the coverage of the Ashes series on BBC Radio - it's very prescient. Shane Warne and Kevin Pietersen, two of the main protagonists in the series to date, are looking rather mean, with the caption: \"Time to Face the Enemy\". The BBC struck it lucky, though. As early as the start of the year the BBC publicity department were planning to offer a campaign for the series incorporating the players. Warne was already on board when they approached the England and Wales Cricket Board - through the team management - seeking co-operation, particularly from Andrew Flintoff. The knock-back was quite startling: no centrally contracted player would be available: all too busy, you see, and it would be an inconvenience. So, when the trip was made to the Rose Bowl to photograph Warne, they asked the non-contracted Pietersen. Perfect. The BBC pays a large sum of money for the rights to broadcast home Test matches, and its publicity department holds quarterly meetings with the ECB. So, it's odd that the organisation that sells the rights is reluctant to co-operate in the marketing of its own product."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
