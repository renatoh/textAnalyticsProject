The pair join the ranks of JK Rowling, Angelina Jolie, Mary Berry and Doreen Lawrence, who have all been previous guest editors of the long-running show. The tradition of bringing in famous and inspiring women to take the helm of Woman\u2019s Hour began in 2014 and has been taken on in differing and original ways by its female guest editors. Jolie focused on sexual violence in conflict and on women\u2019s health while Berry discussed issues such as gardening as a therapy and beekeeping. Ashton is best known for her role as Vod in Fresh Meat but began acting aged six and has also built a successful stage career with performances at the Globe, the Royal Court and the Almeida, as well as playwriting and directing film shorts. On Woman\u2019s Hour, she will discuss, among other things, the anxiety she experiences about starting her period while she\u2019s performing on stage. Simmonds, a five-time paralympic swimming champion, caught the public\u2019s attention in 2008 when she won two gold medals at the Beijing Paralympics, despite being only 13 years old. She won two gold medals again at the London Olympics, becoming a record-breaker for the 400m freestyle, and she earned another gold, and set another world record, at the Rio Paralympics in 2016. Simmonds follows in the footsteps of footballer Eniola Aluko, the last sportswoman to guest-edit the Radio 4 show, which she used to discuss the battle for recognition and equality in women\u2019s football. Simmonds, who is returning to full-time training after taking a year out, will discuss travelling, ocean conservation and her experiences volunteering with the Brownies. Simmonds and Ashton are two of five women who have been invited to make their mark on Woman\u2019s Hour, which has been running since 1946. Shirley Hughes, the children\u2019s book writer and illustrator known for her dogger books, Dame Ann Dowling, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and Karen Blackett, chair of media agency MediaCom, have also been signed up this year. The programme\u2019s editor, Karen Dalziel, said: \u201cI\u2019m excited that once again we have five remarkable women to guest-edit Woman\u2019s Hour. Each has chosen issues she cares about deeply, from ocean conservation to costume design, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll connect with our listeners in a warm and meaningful way. \u201cBy sharing their personal interests and passions, we learn so much more about these well-known and influential women.\u201d Woman\u2019s Hour Takeover Week 2017 starts on Monday 26 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
