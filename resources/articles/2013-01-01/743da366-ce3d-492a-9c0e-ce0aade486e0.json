Johnson leads the Scots into the Six Nations after the resignation of Andy Robinson. As part of Scottish Rugby's four-year strategic plan, winning the World Cup in 2015 has been suggested as a legitimate goal but Johnson believes maximising potential is more important. \"This country is very similar to Wales in the early 2000s; they have the spine of a team which is athletically very gifted,\" said the Australian. \"We have a spine that is world class athletically. If we build a team around that and work on what is important to us as rugby players, not chase rainbows, and focus on what we can do well we will have more good results than bad. That is the kind of country we are; we can't go to the bank and pull player x, y or z like South Africa or England can. \"We have a small playing pool that is pretty close to each other. Let's duck and dive and see if we can overachieve. We'll be competitive enough.\" Johnson, who admitted he is \"not too far off\" selecting a team to face England at Twickenham on 2 February, also expressed his delight at adding Dean Ryan to his backroom staff on a short-term basis. \"In light of the timing issue that confronted us, I'm delighted to have the person who was at the top of my list,\" Johnson said. \"We weren't in a great predicament when Andy left; I came in to do a job with Andy [as assistant coach], a great friend of mine and a great rugby coach. His loss is bigger for me than people realise. I needed someone who was mature, knew the game in the north, understood forward play and was a good bloke. There's a few boxes ticked there with Dean. \"I'm really happy with what we have done in a short space of time. \"I have agreed to do this job for an interim period, I haven't signed a contract for this job. I will work through this period then sit down in front of the board and we will make a decision for what is in the best interests of Scotland. If they and I determine that it is me, I will have a look at it. We will reassess things in June or July.\" Ryan, who has temporarily left his position as an analyst with Sky Sports, re-affirmed he has no desire to remain in the Scottish set-up beyond the Six Nations. \"The reason I haven't coached is that I didn't want to continue with career coaching,\" said the ex-England international. \"This opportunity was for me because it is short-term. I made strong decisions to come away from career coaching. I don't want to spend my life in a three or four year cycle and I don't want my children in that cycle. Then someone comes along and says 'Can you help us with 12 weeks?' \"This doesn't change the dynamic, there's no scenario in 12 weeks that allows me to continue.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
