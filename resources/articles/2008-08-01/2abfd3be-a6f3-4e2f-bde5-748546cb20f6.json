Where once we Europeans used to slaughter each other, now we come together to cook up Champagne Charlie and I Am Dina instead. It's the cinematic equivalent of Eurovision: all together in perfect disharmony. The best Euro puddings are the ones with ambition. Sweeping sagas set in exotic locations with actors famous in their home countries trying to make it big internationally. I imagine producers hoping to unite Europe behind them and storm the box office, before realising the Hollywood machine will beat them once again. And, praise be, there's a tasty example just coming out of the oven, dripping with epic scenes and celebrity actors eager for cash. It's called Bathory, a historical drama starring Anna Friel as the fun-loving Elizabeth Bathory, a 16th-century Hungarian aristocrat best known for bathing in the blood of slaughtered virgins. Friel spends two-and-half hours wielding swords, torturing peasants, surviving poison plots and making love to Caravaggio (yes, the Italian painter) to protect her land. The Blood Countess, the film suggests, didn't in fact spend her time in a tub of the red stuff - that was just an evil rumour spread by jealous chaps lusting after her fortune. Scenes are bathed in a gothic atmosphere that tops every Dracula movie you've seen. The pan-European cast, among them Franco Nero from Italy, Hans Matheson from Scotland and Karel Roden from the Czech Republic, ham it up with glee, while Friel rolls her r's in an interesting attempt at a local accent. Directed by Slovakia's Juraj Jakubisko, the \u00a39.5m Czech-Slovak-Hungarian-British production is the most expensive movie ever made in central Europe. Thankfully for its producers, Bathory has been a commercial hit - topping the Czech box office for the past month and breaking records in Slovakia. If we're lucky it might even head to Britain too. Ditto the second version of Bathory's life to hit our screens in as many years: another promising Euro pudding entitled The Countess. Directed by Julie Delpy, The Countess looks to be trying to extend its Euro appeal still further than Bathory. Alongside La Delpy in the title role are actors from Romania, Croatia, Spain, Germany and France, as well as William Hurt. It's due for release next year. I'm salivating already."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
