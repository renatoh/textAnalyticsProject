That may seem paradoxical, but for months, if not years, Mr Brown has weighed every public word for fear that he would either tie himself too tightly to the outgoing prime minister's plans or else would damage his own standing by looking disloyal. But he is now free to chart his own course, and interviewed on Andrew Marr's sofa yesterday - where he had to laugh at Rory Bremner's impressions and listen to Rufus Wainwright - he appeared thoughtful and relaxed when he spoke about the NHS, which he has identified as his pressing priority. It will not be all change. Mr Brown has, after all, been closely involved for a decade. And some of his past doubts on reform, as on foundation hospitals, now seem to have passed. But where Tony Blair came to believe that market mechanisms offered all the answers, Mr Brown hints that - when patients are dependent on doctors' advice and when many services will always be monopolies - a subtler approach is required. Such new thinking is welcome, despite the government's many successes. True, Labour has consigned the once-routine winter crises to the past and waiting lists are much-reduced. But the public, who, polls record, now prefer the Tories to Labour on health, can be forgiven for not seeing it this way. Most experience the NHS through GPs, who they know are now paid much more, while convenient appointments can still be hard to come by. Voters also listen carefully to nurses and doctors they know, who tell them - as the BMA argued last week - that reforms have damaged morale. Turning that round is Mr Brown's first challenge. Of course, some NHS professionals want a well-funded but easy life, and no health secretary granting that would be serving patients well. But nor should medics be treated with disdain. After all, they understand the health service and are motivated by public duty as well as self-interest. To take one example of what has gone wrong: the many woes of the NHS's \u00a312bn IT programme largely flow from the lack of staff involvement in its design. More generally, changes work best when the staff are behind them. That is why it is not only medics who say there are problems. A survey in the department of health itself found only 4% of top officials thought change was well managed. A first step in winning staff round will be showing that reforms will be driven by what works, not dogma. Choice makes most sense with primary care - where patients are best-placed to evaluate the service they get - yet has so far been pushed hardest in hospitals. Payment-by-results must be made smarter so it drives real efficiency rather than the cherry-picking of easier-to-treat cases. And private provision has been made more contentious as it is increasingly being commissioned where it may replace, rather than add to, NHS services. Mr Brown signals private involvement will continue, but he needs to tackle anxieties running well beyond the old left. Private providers must not be allowed to develop the sort of lobbying power that the financial services industry uses in pensions to gain at the expense of the customer. When the NHS recently filled a top post from United Health, where Mr Blair's former health adviser is chair, it is crucial that no single firm gets too close to government. Earlier reports suggested Mr Brown believed that making the NHS independent would remove the political sting. Yesterday he said that, while he wants more delegation, he knows it is not as easy as that. When the torrent of cash is about to slow to a trickle, and when change must avoid creating new instability, Mr Brown needs to put the best brains available on the job. His close friend Ed Balls has a proven flair for getting things done. He has been tipped for the Treasury, but it might be that it is health that most needs a minister who will dare to speak the truth about what needs to be done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
