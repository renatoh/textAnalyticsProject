That four in 10 respondents supported socialism suggests the US might be shaking off decades of stigma \u2013 in keeping with the rising prominence of avowedly democratic socialist politicians, such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. According to the survey from Axios on HBO, respondents had varying views on what comprised a socialist political system. Seventy-six percent of respondents agreed that universal healthcare was a hallmark of socialism. Seventy-two percent agreed that tuition-free education was also a characteristic of socialism, and 68% thought a living wage was part of a socialist system. Large numbers of respondents also agreed that socialism was linked to several unfavorable political characteristics. Fifty-seven percent agreed that \u201cstate-controlled media and communication\u201d were among the things constituting socialism, and 49% agreed it was a \u201csystem dependent on dictatorship\u201d. However, the poll showed a gender divide when it comes to US attitudes to socialism. Although 55% of women in the 18-54 age group said they would prefer living in a socialist country, \u201ca majority of men prefer to live in a capitalist country\u201d, Axios noted. \u201cIt\u2019s been a truth of American politics for decades that women are to the left of men, and I think that\u2019s playing out in this poll,\u201d said Felix Salmon of Axios. Donald Trump has frequently railed against socialism as he gears up to bid for a second term. In April he told a rally in Wisconsin that America \u201cwill never be a socialist country\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
