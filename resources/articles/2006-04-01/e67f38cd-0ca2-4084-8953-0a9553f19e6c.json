He then rose to become the Sinn F\u00e9in party's administrator at Stormont, the Northern Ireland parliament building, before being exposed last December as a double agent working for British intelligence. He was close to both the Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, the party's chief peace negotiator. As Stormont administrator, he maintained their strict control, helping to vet and discipline electoral candidates and members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and to negotiate as Sinn F\u00e9in worked to persuade the IRA to disarm. After the revelations that he had spied for the British, Donaldson retired to a semi-derelict cottage in Donegal. His wife, Alice, was rumoured to have visited him there, although the family had disowned him after the spying revelations. Hugh Jordan, a journalist with the Dublin-based Sunday World, tracked him down two weeks ago and found him \"nervous and depressed\", maintaining himself by chopping wood and cooking, living without electricity or running water. However, Jordan said he had the impression that Donaldson did not think his life was in danger. In December, Sinn F\u00e9in said he was not under threat; he is believed to have been given an amnesty after making a full confession of his dealings with the British. Jordan said that Donaldson had declined the offer of lunch or a drink. Donaldson, born and educated in Belfast, was a small, snappily dressed man, given to distinctive jackets and with an easy manner. He was liked and respected by those who encountered him, among them politicians, civil servants and journalists. He was described as walking the corridors at Stormont, once the bastion of Protestant rule in Northern Ireland, \"as if he owned them\", and moved with the same ease in the White House, which he visited frequently. Film of him in Stormont with Adams and McGuinness show a man apparently easy in their company. Like so many young, working-class northern Catholics of his generation, Donaldson was recruited into the IRA as the civil rights movement descended into the violence of the early 1970s. He came to local prominence as a defender of St Matthew's chapel, in the Short Strand, a tiny Catholic enclave caught between the Lagan river and the Protestant heartlands of East Belfast. He was interned several times, and in the camps met both Adams and Bobby Sands, a close friend, who died on hunger strike in 1981. In 1983, he stood unsuccessfully for a Westminster seat in East Belfast, the constituency that includes the Short Strand. During the 1980s Donaldson travelled several times to the Lebanon. When arrested for using a false passport at Orly airport, Paris, in 1981, he said he had been attending a training camp in the Middle East. He also travelled extensively in the United States, holding talks with Sinn F\u00e9in fundraisers. He returned to the Lebanon in the late 1980s to attempt to negotiate the release of the Irish journalist, Brian Keenan, with Hizbollah. In the last two years he travelled, again presumably on false passports, to Colombia, to support three IRA suspects later convicted of helping Farc guerrillas. Since his exposure as a double agent, some have alleged that the ease with which Donaldson passed through security checks indicated that the British facilitated some of his journeys. Certainly his career and murder open windows into the murky world of spying and dirty tricks in Northern Ireland. He is survived by Alice, two sons and a daughter. \u00b7 Denis Donaldson, politician and double agent, born 1950; died April 4 2006."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
