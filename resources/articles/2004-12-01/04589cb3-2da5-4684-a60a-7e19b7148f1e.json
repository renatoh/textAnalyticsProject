Pessoa, winner of the World Cup title three years in succession, 1998 to 2000, faces some tough opponents, among them Germany's Franke Sloothaak and Lars Nieberg, both of whom need a good result in Sunday's World Cup qualifier to secure a place in the final in Las Vegas in April. Michael Whitaker, ninth in the World Cup standings, has a good chance of securing his place in the final if he and Portofino can put up a good performance on Sunday. Robert Smith is also well placed, despite losing the services of his Olympic horse, Mr Springfield, because of injury. Instead he has the impressive Marius Claudius, his 2002 Olympia World Cup winner. Nick Skelton partners his Olympic horse Arko and has a good second string in Russell. A fifth member of the Whitaker family will make his debut this evening; the 12-year-old George Whitaker, a nephew of John and Michael and cousin of Ellen and Robert, will take part in the Pony Club's 75th-anniversary showjumping competition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
