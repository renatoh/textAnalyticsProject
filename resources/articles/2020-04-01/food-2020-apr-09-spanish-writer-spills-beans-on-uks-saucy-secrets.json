Before hitting it some more. But, equally baffling to foreign eyes, noses and stomachs is the UK\u2019s consumption of a rich and strange array of actual sauces. Handily for Spaniards, one of the country\u2019s eminent cultural diplomats and noted gourmands has just produced a guide to what to expect \u2013 and what to reject \u2013 when confronted with the conundrum of the UK\u2019s many condiments. Ignacio Peyr\u00f3, a journalist and author who is also the director of the Instituto Cervantes in London, begins his 1,000-word piece for Spanish Esquire with a wily disclaimer: \u201cRailing against British food is a passion capable of bringing together not just visitors to these isles but also the locals themselves \u2026 Whether justified or not, the bad reputation of English food remains one of the most dependable things in this world.\u201d From there on, things are appropriately bittersweet. English mustard \u2013 \u201cthe most patriotic\u201d of all British sauces \u2013 harbours \u201csuch a devastating strength that it scorches the unsuspecting palate as thoroughly as the most spiteful chilli\u201d. Ditto horseradish sauce. Peyr\u00f3 has the grace to acknowledge that Marmite isn\u2019t really a sauce before dismissing it as \u201cfilth\u201d, and moving on to mint sauce. Perhaps, he suggests, the herbal accompaniment is used to disguise the advanced age at which people in the UK like to eat their lamb. In Spain, he adds, they tend \u201cmore towards infanticide when it comes to matters ovine\u201d. Branston pickle is \u201ca classic snack for drunk people\u201d, while HP sauce is \u201ca sickly-sweet, unsophisticated\u201d barbecue-sauce-style affair consumed in \u201cits hectolitres\u201d with Sunday morning English breakfasts across the land. There are, however, exceptions. Piccalilli \u2013 aka \u201cmustard with other stuff\u201d, aka \u201cthat noble Anglo-Indian spiritual creation\u201d \u2013 is great with ham, he conceeds. Bread sauce, meanwhile, is a \u201csplendid and vital accompaniment to a good Scottish partridge\u201d, and Peyr\u00f3 can\u2019t for the life of him fathom why \u201cit\u2019s had less success abroad than Ringo Starr\u2019s solo career\u201d. And then there is the brown alchemy contained in a bottle of Lea and Perrins, which demands to be unleashed and applied liberally to a piece of Welsh rarebit \u2013 \u201cas it is by all good Britons\u201d. For all his ribbing, Peyr\u00f3, who has lived in the UK for two-and-a half years, is enthusiastic and knowledgeable when it comes to UK produce and cooking. He is a fan of its kippers, soups, fresh raspberries, oysters, fennel, \u201creally, really good eggs\u201d, and what he calls its \u201cextraordinary range\u201d of beers \u2013 even if many would not suit a Spanish summer afternoon\u2019s drinking. \u201cI always defend British food and I think it\u2019s not as well known as it should be,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cYou\u2019ve got wonderful things, such as pies \u2013 chicken and leek pie, for instance, is a marvellous thing \u2013 which are lovely because they\u2019re sort of ancient foods; a bit like Henry VIII\u2019s tupperware. And besides, a pie is always something special. Then you have the roasts. You just can\u2019t argue with roast beef.\u201d But, as with his heretical stance on Marmite, there are some things he fears he will never get his head or mouth around. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think anyone from the continent ever gets used to rhubarb,\u201d he admits. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, but it\u2019s such a beautiful colour!\u2019 But no. You do what you can, but it\u2019s impossible.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
