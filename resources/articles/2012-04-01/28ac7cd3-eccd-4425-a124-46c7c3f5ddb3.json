Highlights include Whit Stillman's lovable college satire Damsels In Distress, Indonesian martial arts epic The Raid and Samsara, another epic documentary from Ron \"Baraka\" Fricke. But it's really a case of pick your speciality: new American indies; European cinema; horror; Looney Tunes \u2013 all are well represented here. And not forgetting a 60th-anniversary tribute to the triple-screen Cinerama format at the traditional Widescreen Weekend. Various venues, Thu to 29 Apr Argentine Film Festival, London It's fairly obvious even to those who have holed themselves up in cinemas for months on end that Anglo-Argentine relations might not be at a political high right now. But perhaps culture could be the antidote to all the Falklands-throwback sabre-rattling. This is Britain's first film festival dedicated solely to the country, and it's about time. The \"New Argentine Cinema\" movement has made names such as Lucrecia Martel and Pablo Trapero internationally known, and it's a movement that continues to bear fruit, including an Oscar win for The Secret In Their Eyes in 2010. The star of that film, and many others, Ricardo Dar\u00edn, is to be found here in the opening Chinese Take-Away, a cross-cultural comedy that's been the year's biggest domestic hit. Other discoveries include the Pedro Almod\u00f3var-produced teen movie The Last Summer Of La Boyita, witty Buenos Aires romance Medianeras and the UK premiere of Pablo Fendrik's 2007 landmark drama The Mugger. Ritzy Cinema, SW9, Thu to 22 Apr Palestine Film Festival, London Events elsewhere in the Arab world have overshadowed Palestine recently, but here's a reminder that a) cultural life goes on there, and b) the situation is no less urgent. Marking nearly 100 years of Palestinian cinema, there are some archive rarities here, including some seldom seen footage from the British Colonial era, Susan Sontag's little-known 1970s documentary Promised Lands and the recently rediscovered French Maoist \"cine-manifesto\" L'Olivier \u2013 all of which are accompanied here by lively panels of scholars and film experts. Fictional features, as usual, tend to the short and mid-length form, though Sameh Zoabi's feature Man Without A Cell Phone gives you an up-to-the-minute satire on information-age life in a small Palestinian town. Barbican Screen, EC2 &amp; various venues, Fri to 3 May London Independent Film Festival \"Independent cinema\" is a bit of a nebulous term these days, when studio-backed star vehicles can claim the title as much as shoestring-budgeted labours of love. This festival tends very much towards the latter, keeping it real, cheap and edgy. And often British. From a biopic of Aleister Crowley to a mockumentary on fantasy gaming, to a documentary on Belarus's dictatorial president \u2013 you can see why much of this stuff didn't get major backing. Not that it's necessarily uncommercial. Promising new films such as Verity's Summer and time-travel drama Dimensions could perhaps be destined for bigger things.
