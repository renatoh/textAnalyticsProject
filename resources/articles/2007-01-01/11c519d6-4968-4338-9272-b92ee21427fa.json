It's worth remembering that, when faced with a PR offensive which implies these are the only schools that raise standards, are innovative and have a distinct ethos. Expanding the number of academies to 400 now appears to be the main thrust of education policy. Even trust schools, over which such a ferocious battle was being fought this time last year, barely register. For parents in the thriving but parallel universe of the successful community school, it's depressing. There are countless secondary schools that have done great things, starting from very low levels of achievement and succeeding without academy status, a sponsor, a shiny new \u00a340m building, a strong Christian ethos, a house system, or faux independent-school uniforms. But no one ever talks about them. They don't fit the current agenda. They have travelled a solid, less glitzy path, led by strong heads, teachers and governors, and often supported by local authorities rather than hedge-fund managers or faith groups. One of the most destructive side-effects of the Cresta Run dash for attention-seeking initiatives is the talking down of anything that doesn't fit in with the current gimmick. Who can imagine a minister celebrating a community school for its positive ethos or exciting, creative environment? Far too risky to admit this could happen without the injection of business or religious spirit. Too many schools do still fail but, in spite of the spin, it is too early to say whether the hugely expensive academy experiment will be the golden bullet that eradicates the problem. The latest Ofsted annual report claims the progress of academies is broadly positive, though uneven. Of the nine that were inspected, three were good, five were satisfactory and one was inadequate. And this from a chief inspector who recently reminded all other schools that \"satisfactory\" now means not good enough. The much vaunted leap in five good GCSEs between academies and their predecessor schools also needs closer examination. According to information released under the Freedom of Information Act and in parliamentary questions (it is not available any other way), it evaporates into a handful of percentage points when the four-GCSE GNVQ is stripped out and the requirement for a maths and English GCSE pass is included. Then there are the schools, like the Paddington Academy, where the transition from challenging inner-city school to academy has been so poorly managed that, even with \u00a350m of new capital, children are still learning in a building site, which until recently had no phones, no ICT, no governing body and a huge deficit after only eight weeks of term. The Labour MP Karen Buck, who removed her son from the school, explained diplomatically: \"There may have been a tendency to underestimate the challenges and to assume that a managerial new broom was all that was needed.\" Her advice to the government? Academies need to be part of the local authority family, engage in dialogue with parents, and demonstrate \"transparency and accountability in all their sponsors' dealings\". No one wants to begrudge any school its success or popularity, especially if it is serving a disadvantaged community. But the first stage of turning round a failing school is often the easy bit. The long slog of sustaining that is the hard part, and invariably comes from outstanding heads with strong management teams. There is a whiff of the emperor's new clothes about the current situation. Patchy success at a very early stage is being overspun to justify pouring money and political capital into a few hundred schools, with minimal evidence of any benefit to the rest, and no one appears willing to challenge that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
