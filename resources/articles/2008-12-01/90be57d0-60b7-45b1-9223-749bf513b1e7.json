But Harper's recent political wrangling is evidence of a deeper cross-country rift that must be bandaged in order for Canada to right itself. And despite its legitimacy, Alberta's annoyance with Ontario can no longer be allowed to put Canada's unity at risk. Albertans have been angry for a long time, and convincing the majority of them that the Liberals are up to old tricks, attempting to steal power in Ottawa, is not a hard sell. The freshest of angry memories is over Pierre Trudeau's disastrous \"National Energy Programme\" of the early 1980s, which attempted to re-distribute Alberta's oil wealth, and effectively scuttled the province's main source of income during an already harsh energy crisis. It was a dark chapter in Canadian provincial relations, as Albertans felt gutted by the eastern-strong Liberal party, which appeared incapable of releasing any money or power from Ontario's historical grasp. Those bruises still run deep, despite a renewed oil boom, and the election of Stephen Harper \u2013 an Albertan \u2013 to the prime minister's office in 2006 was seen as a long-overdue legitimisation of Alberta's political strength within Canada. However, it is this anger toward Trudeau's Liberal party that allows for some insight into Stephen Harper's recent tactical political errors: a manifestation of Western alienation coming home to roost. No matter the reasoning, his actions were an attempt at Liberal party destruction \u2013 a reckless move rooted in the latent frustration that is felt throughout his home province. It got the better of him, to perhaps disastrous consequences. If Harper's decisions are examined through the prism of Alberta's revenge, the reaction from the opposition is a strong metaphor for how Alberta has perceived its treatment since confederation in 1867: that if it speaks up, the powers of Ontario and Quebec will combine to crush it. For this reason, the current Tory line that a Liberal-led coalition would be illegitimate is popular. The attempt by the Liberals to seize power strikes a familiar chord, and that the coalition would be propped up by a separatist party from Quebec \u2013 no less \u2013 makes it all too much for most Albertans to stomach. It is, in a word: typical. This all offers a glimpse into a torrid and ongoing sub-plot in the Canadian story \u2013 that of a desire for Alberta to stick it to Ontario. Albertan separation is the bastard cousin of Quebecois nationalism: muted but ever-present, grown louder as recent oil money has poured in. It has become a chip handed down to the shoulders of younger generations, jeopardising the federalist intentions for this expansive nation. This perception of the perfidious east is pervasive within much of the newest homegrown working generation in Alberta, and offers a potentially troubling future. There are many who feel the same as their parents, hoping that the boom will continue, and that the federal government in Ottawa will keep its hands out of their pockets. But the boom will eventually bust, and in the meantime Canada will need oil revenues if it hopes to remain afloat in a shrinking global economy. Young Albertans must learn that their ingrained anger is perhaps misguided Have they suffered? No. They walked into the biggest job market in the nation, are making large salaries, and live in vibrant cities, such as Edmonton and Calgary. For the current generation, any desire to retain their wealth at all costs smacks of hypocrisy and greed. Softening any of this anger between Alberta and Ontario is \u2013 however ironically \u2013 perhaps only possible if Stephen Harper remains in power. Unless Michael Ignatieff wins a legitimate election, there is no hope for the Liberals to make inroads in Tory Alberta - and even then, his position as head of the Liberal party will itself be called into question. Rather, Harper's unique position, as both prime minister and a popular Albertan, offers the best hope for a easing of tensions. Harper has already met with Ignatieff to discuss the upcoming budget, which is a good sign of a step back from the brink. Both have to show evidence that the two parties \u2013 effectively, Ontario and Alberta \u2013 can work together for the interest of all Canadians, no matter where they live. As for Albertans, the victim mentality can no longer continue to dictate its provincial or federal voting tendencies. Yes, the province has suffered in the past, but the inherent distaste for all things Ontario is tiresome and dangerous. It promotes blind ill-will, and for a nation facing not only an economic downturn, but also future natural resource distribution issues, it can only lead to more trouble. If Alberta truly wishes to use its position to better Canada, then an on-going feud with Ontario is simply out of the question. It's a harsh conclusion, but Alberta might just have to be the bigger player, and get over it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
