Most recently, the actor, who embraces the term \u201cfeminist\u201d, called out the sexualization of female superheroes in blockbusters while promoting The Martian. She also joined Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s call to arms on the gender pay disparity in Hollywood, saying: \u201cI think everyone should talk about it.\u201d On Tuesday, the Hollywood Reporter published as essay by Chastain, in which she relays the positive experience of working on her upcoming film, The Zookeeper\u2019s Wife, because it boasts a largely female crew. \u201cI\u2019ve never been on a set with so many women,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe\u2019re not even 50% of the crew \u2013 we\u2019re probably something like 20% women and 80% men \u2013 but it\u2019s way more than I\u2019ve ever worked with on a film before.\u201d The film, based on popular nonfiction novel by Diane Ackerman, boasts a female director (Niki Caro \u2013 best known for Whale Rider), three female producers and a female protagonist, played by Chastain. In The Zookeeper\u2019s Wife, the Oscar-nominated actor plays Antonina Zabinski, who along with her husband, Jan Zabinski, ran the Warsaw Zoo during the second world war. The couple saved hundreds of people, and animals, by hiding them in zoo cages during the Nazi invasion. The film is set for release in 2016. Chastain has shot 21 features since breaking on to the scene in 2008 \u2013 four have been directed by women, including Kathryn Bigelow (Zero Dark Thirty), and Liv Ullmann (Miss Julie). Not a bad figure, considering only 7% of the directors of the 250 top-grossing Hollywood-produced films were women \u2013 down 2% on the equivalent figure for 1998 \u2013 in 2014. \u201cFor me, sex really isn\u2019t the qualifier in the way someone directs \u2013 but I just know that when you have a set with predominantly one gender, whether it be all men or all women, it\u2019s not going to be a healthy place,\u201d Chastain writes. \u201cI imagine it\u2019s the same thing in the workforce or other environments: when you have both genders represented, then you have a healthier point of view. The energy is great, you all are working together as a community, and everyone is participating in the exchange of ideas. You don\u2019t feel a hierarchy; you don\u2019t have anyone feeling like they are being left out or bullied or humiliated. Sometimes being the only girl on a set, you can feel like a sexual object.\u201d In her essay, Chastain references Viola Davis\u2019s recent Emmy awards speech, during which her co-star from The Help said: \u201cThe only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity.\u201d Writes Chastain: \u201cIt\u2019s the same situation with female directors versus male directors \u2013 they are not given the same opportunity.\u201d In her essay, Chastain alludes to an assumption made by Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow, who caused a stir after tweeting: \u201cMany of the top female directors in our industry are not interested in doing a piece of studio business for its own sake. These film-makers have clear voices and stories to tell that don\u2019t necessarily involve superheroes or spaceships or dinosaurs.\u201d Argues Chastain: \u201cIt\u2019s not a valid excuse to say women don\u2019t call asking to direct superhero movies. Every female director I\u2019ve asked if she\u2019d be interested in directing a big movie like that says, \u2018Hell, yeah.\u2019 And if that\u2019s true, it shows how deep-seated the problem is. I don\u2019t think the problem is women; it\u2019s the representation. It goes to the agents. It has to change. This is 2015.\u201d Still, Chastain writes that she remains hopeful. \u201cI do think things are changing,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe reason I think they are changing is because whenever I talk about these issues with men I know in the industry \u2013 they are very talented, really intelligent and very successful men \u2013 there\u2019s this embarrassment. They say, \u2018I don\u2019t understand how it got to be like this.\u2019 And I think that is what will help things change because it takes the group that is the majority in the industry to say, \u2018Wait a minute: Maybe it\u2019s more interesting to have more female voices in the executive suite and not just a token woman.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
