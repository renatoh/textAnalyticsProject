Suffocating black clouds descended like a malicious duvet stealing nearly two hours of play, and then the power went. Wan-faced officials, huddling in temporary orange huts, looked in dire need of a session at the tanning salon just up the road. There was, however, early-morning reward for Justin Bishop and Ashley Cowan who split the Worcestershire tail between them, despite a 50 from Steve Rhodes - his highest score of the season. But Essex still faced a deficit of 176, their need not improved when Will Jefferson and Darren Robinson fell early. Alamgir Sheriyar, whose gold coins glisten on his necklace as he stoops in off his long run, trapped Jefferson with his second ball. But despite promising reports a few years ago, at 28 an international call-up is improbable. That chance has been passed on to the next generation - Kabir Ali who, with his team-mate Gareth Batty, was this week picked in the provisional academy squad to go to Australia in the winter. Ali, nestled just behind Dominic Cork in the leading wicket-taker stakes, is a disciple of line and length, skills he swotted up on during long hours spent watching Glenn McGrath bowl in his spell in Worcestershire in 2000. Ali was hoping to go to the academy last year but was injured. Now, thanks to a gangling Australian and some sunshine, he has his chance. \"I went to Perth in the winter to play a bit of cricket and work on rehabilitating my shoulder. And the sun worked its magic - here my shoulder kept seizing up but there I had no problem at all. I was able to work on my fitness, which has paid off this season. My call-up is really good news and I don't think I will mind the workload so long as I don't puke up.\" Rodney Marsh would undoubtedly drink to that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
