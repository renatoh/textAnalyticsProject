The woman, who police said was in her 20s, was walking alone in Chingford, east London, when the two men dressed in black approached her, tried to pull off her headscarf and pushed her to the ground. She reportedly said she was then dragged along the ground during the struggle. Police said the attackers, described as two white males aged 17 to 19, ran off north along Old Church Road. Witnesses told the Evening Standard the victim was lying on the pavement for almost 20 minutes after the attack, before managing to call police and limp to a nearby Turkish restaurant, where she was helped by staff. Koksal Zeyek, 40, the owner of Fes restaurant on Old Church Road, said his staff first noticed the woman sitting on a table outside. \u201cMy colleague, he went out and talked to her and she was explaining she had been attacked because she had been wearing a scarf \u2013 a hijab \u2013 and two white men were trying to take off her scarf,\u201d he said. A waiter at the restaurant told the Evening Standard: \u201cShe told us two white guys shoved her then dragged her along the floor by her headscarf and left her on the pavement. She was having a panic attack when we saw her and could barely breathe.\u201d Zeyek said he noticed that the woman\u2019s injuries were compounded by the scars from a recent operation, and that she was struggling to move. \u201cI held her hand and I helped her to walk in and she called the police and ambulance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ambulance didn\u2019t come, the police didn\u2019t turn up and then after 45 minutes first aid came, they checked her blood pressure and then after 15 minutes \u2026 the ambulance came. And then 20 minutes after the ambulance, the police came. They took more than one hour or something like that. \u201cWe were shocked as well, don\u2019t get me wrong, because the lady had been attacked. Police didn\u2019t come, the ambulance didn\u2019t come and she was shaking and she was struggling and everything.\u201d The Metropolitan police said officers answered reports of a woman having been assaulted at 8.35pm on Wednesday. \u201cNo arrests have been made. Officers from Waltham Forest CID are investigating,\u201d the force said in a statement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
