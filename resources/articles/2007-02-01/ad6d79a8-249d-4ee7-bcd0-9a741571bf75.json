News sites has been reporting on a new version of the gaming handset, set to be announced this year - but Nokia has maintained for the last couple of years it will be retaining the name N-Gage only as a convenient monicker for a range of phones with strong gaming features. It does seem, however, that a new selection of N-Gage branded handsets will be unveiled at GDC - Gamesindustry.biz claims EA and Gameloft have signed up to support the platform. It's bound to be two or three N-series newbies with big screens and decent processors. We're still waiting for the onslaught of mainstream GSM mobiles with built-in 3D chipsets (although apparently, the N93 has 3D hardware, while 3D chipset manufacturer PowerVR claims to have its technology in 40 handsets). This won't be it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
