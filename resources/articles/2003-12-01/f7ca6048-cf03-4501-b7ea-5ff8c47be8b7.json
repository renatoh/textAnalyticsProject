A legal loophole means the ship can avoid Scandinavia's punishing alcohol taxes and it became clear that I was the only person on the ship whose real destination wasn't Oblivion. But before I could get on the ferry I had to navigate through the people getting off who were weaving along the pavements all the way into Stockholm. A very Swedish instruction told them to \"follow the blue line\" painted on the tarmac. It seemed quite beyond the capabilities of most of them to comply and I'm sure that Swedes regard this inability to follow the rules as an extreme form of mental torture. As I waited in the departure lounge a woman with the second most difficult job in Scandinavia was unsuccessfully trying to get an enthusiastic response out of a stone-cold sober crowd of Swedes and Finns. By 10pm that evening, as we headed across the Baltic, I realised that the only harder job was trying to get a drunk crowd of Swedes and Finns to calm down. All over the ship passengers were getting into the spirit of things by singing drinking songs, dancing to appalling euro pop and chasing each other round the decks. Middle aged housewives in their smartest evening dresses were staggering everywhere clutching pint glasses of Pernod and vodka. I did my best to hide in a corner. By around 4am most passengers had either gone to their cabins or drunk themselves unconscious. A Finnish man sitting nearby had remained motionless for several hours with a faint smile on his face. At 5am he quietly pitched forward onto the floor and lay there snoring loudly. As we approached Turku harbour in Finland some of the crew tried to wake him up without success and eventually they just left him there, still with the same faint smile on his face. Tired and hung over, I walked through the early morning fog into town. The day after the night before felt cold and drab, but then after a night on that ferry a power surge in Las Vegas would have seemed dull. The castle, cathedral and old town failed to lift my spirits and the local people, rather than the wild maniacs on the ship, wore unnervingly blank expressions on their faces to such an extent that some seemed to be able to speak without moving their lips. For the first time on this trip I was bored and decided to leave town. After a night on a cold train with cold Finns, I arrived in even colder Rovaniemi on the Arctic Circle. Rather than snow, a light drizzle fell on the grey town. I calculated it had been 12 days since I'd last seen the sun in northern Sweden. Rovaniemi is the official residence of Father Christmas but, as you can imagine, I was in a decidedly un-Christmassy mood as I headed out to see him; in fact I was beginning to display the same facial expressions (or lack of them) as the locals. I visited Santa's post office, where they receive over 1m letters a year, and watched his elves busy at work. I sent a few Christmas cards and as I approached I had to reluctantly admit that I was actually very excited about meeting him. I'd expected the whole thing to be incredibly kitsch but I couldn't help being carried along by the Christmas atmosphere, made all the more striking by being surrounded by Finland. The walls were covered with photos of famous people meeting Santa and the Spice Girls were grinning away all except Posh Spice, who was either unimpressed by Christmas or Finland, or who is perhaps part Finnish. He didn't appear to have been drinking so I was surprised to find that Father Christmas was indeed very jolly, in fact perhaps the only smiling person in the whole of northern Finland. As much as I enjoyed meeting him I was still finding it difficult to warm to Finland. As I travelled south to Helsinki the train passed through endless mile upon mile of pine forest and lakes shrouded in mist. Out of boredom I reached for my little-used minidisc player and chose a disc at random. As the Finnish countryside rolled past it struck me that The Smiths were a very appropriate choice and that Morrissey may well have been thinking of Finland when he wrote: \"Every day is like Sunday. Every day is silent and grey.\" The stream of famous racing drivers produced by Finland suddenly seemed to make sense as I was overtaken by an uncontrollable urge to leave the country in the fastest possible time. My expectations of Helsinki were not particularly high. To my amazement Helsinki was a fantastic city. Perhaps it was because the sun shone for the first time in two weeks or perhaps because the locals seemed far more energetic and expressive than the other places I'd visited. Perhaps, again, it was because it was Friday night and everyone had started drinking again. A friend had put me in touch with a Finnish work colleague in Helsinki called Olivia and we arranged to meet up that evening. Olivia very kindly gave me lots of helpful advice and asked me about my impressions of the city. I said that I was surprised to see Russian influences like the orthodox cathedral, the presidential palace and the fur hats of the presidential guard. This is clearly not the thing to say to patriotic Finns who don't like to think about the Russian occupation between 1809 and 1917. It could have been a lot worse; I could have made unfavourable comparisons with Sweden, who occupied Finland for 600 years before the Russians. In fact, alcohol and insulting Sweden seem to be the only things guaranteed to put a smile on a Finn's face. Olivia had to leave at 9pm to have a sauna, which appeared to be a perfectly normal thing to do in Finland on a Friday night. I can assure Swedes everywhere that I'd remained totally neutral all evening but I must have successfully navigated the minefield of Baltic geopolitics because Olivia invited me to her Finnish Independence Day party the next day. I braved the freezing streets of Helsinki to watch the torchlight processions and listen to the nationalistic songs. Every building in the city was flying the Finnish flag and I assume that the Swedish ambassador had left town for the night. I was almost frozen by the time I got to Olivia's apartment and was introduced to her friends. I was handed the essential equipment of a drink and a small Finnish flag not knowing what to expect from the rest of the evening. The centrepiece of Independence Day for well over 50% of the population of Finland is watching the TV coverage of the party at the totally un-Russian, \"nothing-like-St Petersburg\" presidential palace. Anyone who's anyone in Finland is invited, including my host's kindergarten teacher, and it was a fascinating and totally baffling introduction to Finnish society - like the Oscars, the New Year's Honours List and the National Soap Awards rolled into one. This was followed by all of Olivia's guests singing the national anthem loud enough to be heard simultaneously in Sweden and Russia and then listening, perhaps slightly less traditionally, to Junkmail, Finland's leading rap group. No Independence Day would be complete without The Unknown Soldier, a patriotic film that Robin Allen, a Netjetters reader, quite rightly described as \"Henry V and Reach for the Skies all thrown into one\" in which the plucky Finns massacre large numbers of Russians. The guests seemed to know the script off by heart - although this is easier than it sounds, as \"Look! There's another Russian! Die communist devil!\" is repeated several times. As the ferry to Tallinn passed the totally un-Russian orthodox cathedral and totally un-Swedish Sveaborg fortress that guards the harbour (now uncompromisingly called Suomenlinna or \"Fortress of Finland\"), I was very sad to be leaving. This was hardly the attitude I would have taken a few days before when I would happily have swum to Estonia. I think I have an idea why Father Christmas chose to live here, but if you manage to see Santa in your local shopping centre this Christmas, perhaps you could ask him yourself and apologies on my behalf for those elf jokes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
