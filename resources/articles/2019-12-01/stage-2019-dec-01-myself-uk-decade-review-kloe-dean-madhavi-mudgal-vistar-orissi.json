Their hip-hop, krump and urban vernacular is ubiquitous, from sportswear ads to music vids to Britain\u2019s Got Talent. But it\u2019s still relatively rare for female choreographers to be given big commissions in this field. The dancers perform the mainstream medleys with fierce proficiency. However, they excel in more carefully authored works, where different dance languages flicker through and finer thought is applied to lighting and costume. In Bring It Out, by Marion Motin, the figures are braced, stalled in motion, like athletes frozen mid-race, or petrified factory workers. They tug, pull and squirm while other influences chip in, from a jiving flitter to Indian classical chin tilts, hand turns and warrior poses. Claire Hough\u2019s Under the Knife is an extraordinary expression of female pain. Dancers remonstrate and pull at each other, fight the empty air, smash unseen mirrors, shake off unseen hands and grab themselves self-critically. In Klo\u00e9 Dean\u2019s RED, the performers are poleaxed by heartbreak, bodies prone and bonelessly weak. Hopelessness pulls them to the floor but they spring up defiantly into planks and bridges. Eventually they stand, but stagger, tumbling away from the strong light as if it hurts them. Myself UK is packed with energetic dancers in search of cutting-edge choreography to discipline and challenge them. Sadler\u2019s Wells provided a fittingly upscale home for choreographer Madhavi Mudgal\u2019s brilliant contemporary exploration of the centuries-old odissi dance tradition. She shows there\u2019s much more to Indian classical dance than the better-known kathak and bharatanatyam styles. Odissi reflects architectural structures, exploring movement in dynamic sculptural forms informed by a certain lean classicism. Tonight\u2019s rigorous pieces were accompanied by Madhup Mudgal\u2019s fleet and playful music, including soaring ragas sung by Manikuntala Bhowmik and Khushal Sharma and Rajat Prasanna\u2019s earthy flute. In Trayi, the dancers are a precisely fluttering flock, their kneading gestures both muscular and minimal. The choreography unpeels from centre stage outwards, so the dancers face all directions and patter out backwards and in the round. This makes visible the taut spine, stacked shoulders, cocked neck and crossed ankles as they break into paired twinning and mirroring figures before clustering, arms up, like a single tree basking in summer heat. In Teevra Madhyam, the dancers form a linked chain, stepping, ducking, hanging back and pressing in, slipping to the ground in a synchronised ripple of turned heads. It\u2019s like watching a necklace twist and untwist. The final work, Pallavan, gives \u201cclassic\u201d Indian shapes an otherworldly presentation: the dancers pose, still, in icy light. As they pivot, arms releasing, it\u2019s like watching a garden of statues reawakening from an enchantment. Just because something is old doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s dated. Vistar isn\u2019t about dragging the ancient into the present and begging people to watch it out of respect for the past. It\u2019s about showing the clarity and freshness within the odissi tradition. These concise works are a revelation and a joy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
