The 25-year-old is close to signing the incentivised deal, which could yield about \u00a3150,000 a week, having been a major success for Brendan Rodgers since his \u00a312m arrival from Chelsea in January 2013. Liverpool have been keen to reflect the striker\u2019s impact and increased importance with an improved contract to 2019 and negotiations are understood to be close to completion. Sturridge\u2019s deal will be in keeping with Liverpool\u2019s recent policy of offering performance- and achievement-based contracts and will result in him becoming one of the best paid players at Anfield. He would be in a similar pay bracket to the club\u2019s highest earner, Steven Gerrard, who is in the final year of his contract. Liverpool intend to offer their captain a new 12-month deal beyond the end of this season although Rodgers suggested in Basel on Tuesday that the club need to see \u201chow he feels\u201d. Raheem Sterling is also in line for an improved and extended Liverpool contract. Sturridge has missed Liverpool\u2019s past six games with a thigh injury suffered while training with England and could find himself at the centre of a club versus country dispute should Roy Hodgson name him in his squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia on Thursday. Fitness problems aside, Sturridge has emerged as a key figure in Rodgers\u2019 system at Liverpool \u2013 his responsibility increasing following Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s departure for Barcelona \u2013 and has enjoyed a phenomenal goalscoring record since leaving Chelsea. He has 36 goals in 52 appearances in all competitions for Liverpool, 32 in 46 Premier League games, and is the most prolific striker in his first 50 outings for the club since George Allan in the late 19th century."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
