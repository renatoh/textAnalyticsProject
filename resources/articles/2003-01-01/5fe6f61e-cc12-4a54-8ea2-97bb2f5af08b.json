She went on to write nine more (three of which were filmed for TV), figured regularly in the bestseller lists and was appointed CBE in 1995. A remarkably good-looking woman, she had a commanding presence and could appear reserved when meeting people she did not know. But she was much less confident than she seemed and she had a wonderful sense of humour. She was also a generous friend. She often claimed that her novels were not autobiographical, but aspects of her life are reflected in the themes that run through them. A typical Wesley heroine is a young woman, damaged by parental dislike or neglect, who ties herself to a conventional man who does not understand her, only to find happiness later with an eccentric, tender lover, who values in her all the qualities no one else has recognised. The third child of Colonel Harold Mynors Farmar and his wife, Violet, Mary Aline was born at Englefield Green, Windsor Great Park. She grew up hardly knowing her father and believing that her mother preferred her elder sister. It was assumed that she would never have to work for her living and so she was not sent to school, which added to her isolation. Her beloved nanny was sacked when she was three and her minimal education was left to a series of foreign governesses. Regretting this, in the 1930s she attended lectures on international politics and anthropology at the London School of Economics (60 years later she was awarded an honorary fellowship there). She was presented at court, and married Lord Swinfen in 1937. Having given birth to two sons, she had fulfilled her parents' expectations, only to scandalise them when she left her husband. They were divorced in 1945. The second world war, which was to form the background to many of her novels, changed everything for her. Like so many well-bred young women, she found work in intelligence. She once told an interviewer that the war years gave her generation a very good time: \"an atmosphere of terror and exhilaration and parties, parties, parties\". It was in 1944, dining at the Ritz, that she met Eric Siepmann, the Winchester and Oxford-educated playwright and journalist. Siepmann's father was German and his mother Irish. Her family strongly disapproved. They lived together until his second wife could be persuaded to divorce him and then married in 1952, settling in Devon. Ten years after their first meeting he wrote in his autobiography, Confessions Of A Nihilist, that she was \"somebody whom I really loved, who believed in God and who thought that loving meant what you give and not what you take\". Their years together were so happy that Siepmann's death in 1970 devastated Wesley. She felt as though she had been cut in half, \"like a carcass at the butcher's\". Siepmann had changed jobs frequently and never accumulated any capital, and his death left her bereft and without an income. Wesley sold her jewellery and knitted for whatever her customers could pay. She had been writing for years but had no confidence in what she produced, in spite of her husband's encouragement, and threw most of it away. Her first published works, in 1968, were two children's books, and a third followed in 1983. It was only after Siepmann's death that she found her voice. Then, in Jumping The Queue, she wrote about a woman who could not bear to go on living after her beloved but eccentric husband's death and planned a suicidal picnic. This quirky, sad and very funny novel was quite unlike anything else that was being published in the early 1980s. Had it not been for the intervention of her friend Antonia White, it might have followed its predecessors into the bin. With White's encouragement, Wesley began to submit the manuscript to publishers. Several companies turned down Jumping The Queue on the grounds that there was no interest in \"that kind of book\", but when her then agent Tessa Sayle sent the book to James Hale of Macmillan, he confounded his rivals. Her work soon found a wide public and was admired by critics. Much was made of the fact that the novels are full of illicit sex and that the characters are free with the sort of four-letter words that few women of Wesley's age and class would use. Perhaps more interesting, although it was less remarked at the time, is the hate and violence beneath the surface. Several of her heroines kill, from Mathilda in Jumping The Queue to Sophie, the unloved but deeply lovable child of The Camomile Lawn (1984, and filmed for TV in 1992). It is the violent expression of long-buried anger and distress, quite as much as the frank sexuality of her heroines, that makes her work so different. Her novels are suffused not only with her humour but also with the emotions she preferred not to discuss, and they are inimitable. A book about the West Country with photographer Kim Sayer, Part Of The Scenery, was published in 2001. She had two sons by her first marriage and one son by her second. Julia Blackburn writes: I met Mary Wesley in 1980, when she was living in a tiny house in Totnes, across the road from my stepmother. The first thing I noticed was her extraordinary beauty. She had a quality of poise and self-containment which I've rarely seen. Then my stepmother told me that her neighbour had written a book. It was called Jumping The Queue and she thought it was really very good and deserved to be published. Even before reading it I was intrigued by the plot and by the title. When I read it, I loved it for its extraordinary combination of despair and wild black humour. The title was a perfect reflection of Mary's style of writing and way of thinking. It comes closest to my understanding of her. There were a few more brief meetings. I learnt to appreciate Mary's aloof manner, which seemed to be based on shyness, and a natural sense of human isolation. Her voice fitted her appearance: soft and languorous but with authority and the occasional wild explosions of laughter. She was a good talker, precise in her use of words and never ashamed of pausing for thought. You have to imagine her: tiny, delicate and very ethereal, with a mane of silver hair, silver slippers, dressed in cashmere or silk, trembling with age or perhaps it was simply the effort of concentration, a wonderful jewelled ring glittering on her finger. And then, just as you grew accustomed to this very quiet dignified presence, she would roar with laughter and say something irreverent and laced with obscenities. After my stepmother's death I returned to Totnes in 1987 to sort through family possessions and the memories that were attached to them. Mary invited me to stay with her. I had been \"cut out\" of the will and Mary responded to my situation. She told me how she had been resented and rejected by her mother and eventually estranged from her family. She was unashamed and unequivocal about her anger and pain but never bitter: laughter would always intervene just in time. She had rejected a whole world that rejected her, and she had found her freedom of personality in the process. She had always loved her father and cried when she told me that the severity of his last illness was kept secret from her so that when she arrived to see him, she met his cortege returning from the cemetery. Mary seemed to enjoy the war, as if it fused with her own need to fight against tyranny and the threat to individual freedom. Meeting Eric Siepmann in 1944 provided the love of her life, and at his death she did consider jumping the queue, but wrote the book instead. With Eric's death Mary was like a person who had been through a terrible illness. Being alive at all was a bonus, but at the same time she had looked death in the face and it no longer held any fear for her. When she emerged from her grief, she began to live as if each day might be the last. When she lost younger friends, she said she felt ashamed of staying on. She took great delight in ordering a good red-painted coffin, but there was no morbidity in this, just a simple expectation of what must come and a wish to do it with style, humour and dignity. Her religion was profound and personal, a combination of instinct and intellect. Her husband Eric converted to Catholicism after being reassured that dogs could enter heaven. I think she was confident that the next world would contain not only dogs, but a goose and a pig, as well as friends and lovers and husbands. It was interesting to see how Mary dealt with the avalanche of fame which swept around her. She bought a new car and a slightly larger house with a garden, but nothing much else changed. She had always dressed elegantly, even when she couldn't afford a railway ticket to London. I think she gave away a great deal; she certainly helped me and once muttered something about liking to send money to strangers because she had once been so poor herself and would have appreciated a cheque out of the blue. She enjoyed success, the strange circus of book launches and the excitement of planning the film of a book (even if she tended to dislike the films that emerged). Book promotion tours made her feel she was earning her living and doing something for her publishers in return. She delighted in good reviews and was stung when she was attacked, especially since she avoided reviewing books which she did not like. She really enjoyed writing, and that quality of pleasure is in everything she wrote. You could see her perched at an elegant but rather rickety table in the passageway at the top of the stairs, scribbling away with a pencil or a biro, for hour after hour. She enjoyed the company of her own creations, grew fond of some and irritated by others, and forgot their names when she was not busy with them. She complained bitterly when a plot got stuck, but she was desolate and lonely when a book was completed and had been handed over. I hope she had a good death, she deserved it. Mary Wesley writes: Why did I not do more in my life, I ask myself, as I read the obituaries of the people who have crammed their lives with \"doing\" while I have wasted great chunks of mine dreaming? What have I given? I have lived through two enormous world wars and other smaller ones; aged three I wondered what the world would be like without a war. I have never known, and now we are perilously close to another: my whole being cries halt. My family has a propensity - it must be in our genes - for dropping dead. Here one minute, gone the next. Neat. I pray that I have inherited this gene. I have no wish to linger, to become a bed-bound bore. A short sharp shock for my loved ones is what I want: nicer for them, lovely for me. What shall I find? Is there anybody there? Shall I be starting something new?
