Tarkan Agca, 24, of Watford, Hertfordshire, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Andrej Szaruta, 63, from Bridgwater, Somerset, who had been driving to London for a Father\u2019s Day and birthday celebration. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting at Winchester crown court, said Szaruta \u2013 known as Andy \u2013 was travelling with his wife, Susan, and daughter, Rachel, in his Mercedes along the A303 near Stonehenge in Wiltshire, for a celebration with their son, Christian, on 21 June. Maylin said Agca tailgated them, prompting Szaruta \u201cto tap his brake to indicate the BMW shouldn\u2019t be so close\u201d. The BMW undertook them before \u201csqueezing\u201d in front of them and braking so hard that it was like an \u201cemergency stop\u201d. Maylin said the two drivers pulled over to a slipway by the Solstice Park services and Szaruta walked over towards the BMW, where he was hit by the car and thrown into the air. She said Szaruta\u2019s daughter witnessed the incident and told police: \u201cMy dad had his hand on the bonnet, he went up on the bonnet and high up into the air. Dad was carried a car length on the bonnet.\u201d Maylin said another witness saw Agca driving away \u201cfar in excess of the 70mph limit\u201d and \u201cskipping between cars\u201d. Szaruta died in hospital from a head injury. The court heard Agca had 13 previous convictions for 28 offences, with several relating to road rage incidents which involved tailgating and attacking vehicles, and in one incident where he spat at a driver. The judge, Mrs Justice May, adjourned the case for sentencing on 10 January and ordered a pre-sentence report to consider the \u201cdangerousness\u201d of the defendant. In a statement, Susan Szaruta said she suffers flashbacks and added: \u201cI have lost my husband, my best friend and have to cope with the trauma of what happened.\u201d Rachel Szaruta said her father, a facilities and operations director, was \u201cthe most kind-hearted and bravest man\u201d. The victim\u2019s family said in a statement: \u201cAndy Szaruta, loyal husband to wife Susan, and loving father to daughter Rachel, 28, and son Christian, 32. Andy was a sergeant major in the Royal Marine Commandos for 22 years, gaining medals for serving in the Falklands war, two tours in Northern Ireland, and a Nato medal during the Bosnian war.\u201d Agca was facing a charge of murder but the prosecution accepted his plea of manslaughter. DCI Darren Hannant, said: \u201cThis was an appalling crime where Mr Szaruta suffered ultimately fatal injuries in front of his horrified wife and daughter. \u201cAgca inflicted a cowardly assault on Mr Szaruta, with no justification whatsoever. Agca fled the scene with no regard or concern for how seriously injured his victim was and, until recently, had not accepted any responsibility for what happened.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
