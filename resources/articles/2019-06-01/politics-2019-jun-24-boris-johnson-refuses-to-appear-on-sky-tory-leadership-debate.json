The broadcaster said that unless Johnson agreed to take part in the debate on Tuesday it would not go ahead. Instead it offered an alternative date of 1 July in an effort to get him and his fellow contender, Jeremy Hunt, to appear. Hunt had agreed to take part in Tuesday\u2019s debate and urged Johnson to join him. But Johnson\u2019s team has repeatedly refused to say whether he plans to take part as it continues to restrict his media appearances. The head-to-head format of the planned debate meant it would not have been possible for Johnson to be replaced by an empty podium on Sky as he was in a Channel 4 debate earlier in the leadership contest last week. Hunt\u2019s team is reported to have branded Johnson a \u201cbottler\u201d for refusing to appear. A Sky spokesman said: \u201cSky News has been planning to hold a debate tomorrow between the two remaining candidates in the Conservative leadership election. Jeremy Hunt has agreed to take part but Boris Johnson has so far declined the invitation.\u201d He added: \u201cWe stand ready to host a debate tomorrow evening if both candidates make themselves available. Without both candidates, tomorrow\u2019s debate will not take place. But we will reissue our invitation for Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson to debate live on Sky News next Monday, July 1.\u201d Hunt has joined calls for Johnson to explain why police were called to his home in the early hours of Friday after an argument with his partner, saying his rival \u201cneeds to show he can answer difficult questions\u201d. The foreign secretary followed cabinet ministers, backbenchers and a major party donor in demanding that the frontrunner to succeed Theresa May speak out about the loud, late-night altercation with Carrie Symonds, which was heard by several neighbours. Hunt suggested Johnson was shying away from scrutiny, telling Sky News: \u201cThis is an audition to be prime minister of the UK \u2026 If Boris is refusing to answer questions in the media, refusing to do live debates then of course people are thinking: just who are we going to get as PM?\u201d In a tweet on Monday, Hunt said: \u201cIf you want to lead this country you have to show up and answer questions on your plans for Britain.\u201d Hunt also used a Times column to urge Johnson to take part in Tuesday\u2019s debate or risk being viewed as a coward. He said: \u201cDon\u2019t be a coward Boris, man up and show the nation you can cope with the intense scrutiny the most difficult job in the country will involve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
