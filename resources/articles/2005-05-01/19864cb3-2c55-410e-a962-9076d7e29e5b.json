Six feature-length episodes amount to a single film lasting 680 minutes, and maybe deciding to watch this is quite as much of an epic undertaking, almost a folie de grandeur, as actually making it. Heimat 3 begins like a TV serial with love stories and infidelities, and winds up looking like a three-volume Victorian novel, with a disputed legacy and a hidden treasure. Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold) is the famous conductor who, as the Berlin Wall comes down, is reunited with his old love Clarissa Lichtblau (Salome Kammer); they set up home together near his home town in the stunning Rhine Valley, near the Lorelei Rock, and Hermann finds himself embroiled once again in his family's destiny. For my money, the star of this saga is Gunnar, a terrific performance from Uwe Steimle, the hapless but likeable carpenter from East Germany whose pretty wife runs off with Hermann's agent. He looks like a symbol of the poor Ossis, who find that reabsorption into the fatherland on the west's terms is a mixed blessing. Clearly, watching Heimat 3 requires a colossal investment of attention and some might find that the return on that investment is not enticing. As the episodes went by, I became mildly hooked on the very German high-seriousness, combined with the story's extravagant soapishness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
