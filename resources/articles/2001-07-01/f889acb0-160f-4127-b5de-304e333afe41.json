He received a hero's welcome when he arrived in Cardiff from Auckland, but when he returns to his adoptive home from the Lions tour after unwinding on the Gold Coast he will face more jeers than cheers. Leading the charge of the angry brigade will be some of the Welsh players who were in Australia and who have admitted, privately rather than publicly, that they are angry not just at the way they were treated as training fodder on the trip but because their national coach refused to tell them why they were not in the frame for the Tests. \"Graham has some fences to mend,\" said one player. \"His relationship with many here has changed and we could face a difficult few months on the national front. Words need to be expressed and views exchanged if we are to get back to where we were.\" The Wales captain David Young, one of eight Welsh players here whose fate was to play in the midweek side which was largely ignored by the management, is close to Henry and admitted that there was some resentment towards the New Zealander. \"It is a downside of having the coach of a national team take charge of the Lions,\" said Young. \"The English, Scottish and Irish can go home and have a gripe to their coaches about how they were treated on the tour. We can hardly sound off to Graham, but I will be telling him when he returns home that he has to meet the players who went to Australia as a matter of urgency because the air has to be cleared. \"Graham has told me that he would be happy for me to carry on as captain next season as long as my club form was good enough, but I do not want to be steering a divided ship. \"Graham has to recognise that players deserve explanations about how they were treated, while the players, for their part, must not let their personal disappointment and frustration get in the way of helping Wales become successful. Their attitude, and I have told them this, must be to show Graham that he and the Lions' selectors were wrong to overlook them, and that means starting the new campaign with a bang, not feeling sorry for themselves.\" Young was speaking with the experience of a third-time Lion but for the likes of Colin Charvis, the flanker whose two starts on the tour were against mediocre opponents, the Queensland President's XV and the NSW Country Cockatoos, the delight he felt in April when he was named in the 37-strong squad is a distant memory. \"I am not going to speak out against the management, because the decisions they made were aimed at ensuring the Test series was successful,\" he said. \"I came here hoping to prove to myself that I could make the step up to the next level, but I never had the chance to do that and I am going back to Wales still not knowing what the answer is.\" Henry is unrepentant. During his time with Wales he has never told players why they have been left out of a side or substituted and he will not listen with much enthusiasm to Young's call for a meeting. \"I may have an informal chat with them but at the end of the day there is not much to say,\" he said. \"They had a job to do in Australia and so did I. Some of them were very close to making the Test team, losing out because of the strength of the competition in their positions rather than because they were not good enough, and they have to be professional enough to recognise that. \"I accept it has been hard on the players who were in the midweek side and David Young did an excellent job as captain, but the tour was so short that we had to concentrate on the Test team from day one. We could not have done things any differently.\" Henry's contract with the Welsh Rugby Union runs until the end of the 2003 World Cup, in which Wales are set to be in the same group as the All Blacks; the New Zealander will be going back to the land of his fathers. At \u00a3250,000 a year, Henry is not going to walk away from the job and the WRU cannot afford to dismiss him but, as Welsh supporters at Sydney airport last night stressed, no longer is there a feeling of gratitude or indebtedness. \"It is time for him to do something,\" said one. A player put it almost as succinctly. \"Before this tour I felt that I owed a debt of obligation to Graham. Not any more. I think he is in for his hardest couple of months since he came to Wales.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
