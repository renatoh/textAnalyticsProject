People all over the country are dusting off the last of the mince pie crumbs and dragging themselves painfully back to work. Offices are re-opening, schools filling up for the first time in a few weeks. Not here. We never closed. We arrive in work \u2013 business as usual once again, but the ambulances are already queuing around the drive to A&amp;E. Eight in the morning and the department is full. I walk through the ambulatory care centre. Usually it\u2019s a day unit for patients that need blood tests or routine investigations \u2013 but overnight it has become a makeshift ward because the hospital is bursting to capacity. The day-centre managers are unhappy because there is nowhere for the day-case patients to be seen now. The bed manager from the night shift looks exhausted, and explains she had a choice between blocking up the unit or leaving five elderly, frail ladies in a cold hospital corridor all night long. She can\u2019t win. None of us can. The morning progresses. Men in suits with clipboards walk the corridors, their faces reflecting the futility of their assignment. Their task: to move patients from A&amp;E to the medical and surgical wards upstairs. But there are no beds upstairs. There are no beds anywhere. The shift continues but the ambulances do not stop coming. Sepsis. Seizures. Overdoses. Haemorrhages. These aren\u2019t patients in the wrong place or patients abusing the system \u2013 these people are exactly where they should be \u2013 but there isn\u2019t the spaceanywhere to put them. Another sick patient arrives, he needs urgent resuscitation, but the resuscitation bays are full. Some quick juggling by the A&amp;E sister and a patient moves to a corridor to allow the acutely sick patient to get his treatment. He\u2019s stabilised, but the seams of the department are creaking now. The silver and gold command managers are doing everything they can to create room \u2013 they ask if we can divert our ambulances to another hospital to ease the pressure, but the answer is no. All the surrounding hospitals are in exactly the same situation. This isn\u2019t a freak day for our area, this is winter in the NHS. More time passes and more ambulances arrive. We see as many as we can. Antibiotics. Fluids. Pain relief. Tea. Hold a hand. Reassure. Write something in the notes. Move on. There are doctors seeing patients in corridors. At medical school we do not get lessons in how to examine a woman\u2019s abdomen in a busy walkway while still maintaining her privacy, but we muddle through, and the patients couldn\u2019t be more understanding and are just happy to be receiving care without having to wait even longer. Most have been here for hours already, and haven\u2019t even seen a doctor yet. Another ambulance arrives. The crew report that the patient is very sick, but there is no room inside. A doctor rushes into the back of the ambulance, makes a quick assessment, and sends them to a neighbouring hospital that has the specialist surgeons to save this patient\u2019s life. I hear one doctor remark that she\u2019s never seen the hospital as busy as this. A consultant rushes past and quips with a grimace that he unfortunately has. The chaos escalates into the afternoon. The medical director \u2013 the chief physician \u2013 is marching through A&amp;E, through the hospital, trying to send patients home where he can. We discharge patients that, were this a quiet week in June, would most certainly stay an extra night or two for observation and rehabilitation. We cannot afford them this time now. It isn\u2019t the ideal care we want to give. But when there are other patients that could otherwise die in the corridors before we get to them, what else can we do? My colleagues look how I feel: exhausted. Some will go home and weep tonight. They\u2019ll tell their husbands or their wives that this isn\u2019t what they signed up for. They wanted to help people, to be doctors, nurses, physiotherapists or pharmacists. But how can you help people properly in a broken system? Elsewhere, the children are rolling out of school. Offices close for the day, as people trudge home, weary from their first day back at work after Christmas. They are oblivious to the pandemonium ensuing inside our hospital, and many others like it up and down the country. The government will continue to deny the truth: that our healthcare system is desperately underfunded. It is understaffed. It is becoming unsafe, to the point where the Red Cross is declaring a humanitarian crisis. We spend less on healthcare than most of our neighbours in Europe. We have fewer doctors than most of our neighbours in Europe. We tried to tell the government. We went on strike. We wrote newspaper articles. We went on television. We met our MPs. We marched. We sang. We released a music single. But instead of listening, the government silenced us. Drowned us out. Dismissed us. Vilified us. Ignored us. Jeremy Hunt will make another visit to a hospital. He\u2019ll give a nice sound bite about what a sterling job everyone is doing, along with a warped half-lie about how they have increased NHS funding to help ease the pressure. He\u2019ll pose for a photograph with us. We\u2019ll smile serenely. Everything is under control. Right?
