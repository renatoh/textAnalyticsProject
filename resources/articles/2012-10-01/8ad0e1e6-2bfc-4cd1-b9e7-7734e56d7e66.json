The brothers, Shola and Sammy, are poised to become the third pair of siblings to start a competitive first-team game for Newcastle United after George and Ted Robledo in the 1950s and Matty and Richard Appleby during the 1990s. While Shola has been part of the club's senior striking rota since Sir Bobby Robson's days in charge, Sammy, the junior by a decade, is now striving to emulate him. At 31 years old the former serves as a role model for his similarly attack-minded but positionally more versatile sibling who can operate either as a deep-lying forward or wide midfielder. \"There's nearly 11 years between us, so when we were growing up I think Sammy was maybe a little bit intimidated by me, which is normal,\" said Shola. \"But we have a great relationship now. I feel that as a big brother, I have to make sure he's on the right track all the time. I know my parents expect that of me and it's something I'm conscious about doing. \"I'm sure he's well aware of how hard it's going to be and what he has to put in to make it to the very top. But I want to see him surpass anything I've ever done in this game and I know he has the ability. He can do it, without a shadow of a doubt. I don't coach him because I don't profess to be a coach but I try to tell him about the mistakes I've made along the way \u2013 which are a few \u2013 and try to help him not to repeat them.\" Pardew believes both the junior Ameobi and Shane Ferguson, pencilled in to start at left-back, can break into the first team. \"It's a big game for Sammy and Shane,\" said Pardew. \"I hope to see two fine performances from them.\" Newcastle's manager is delighted that Xisco, very much the club's forgotten striker, scored a hat-trick in a reserve win over Stoke this week but will not involve the former Spain Under-21 striker against Brugge. A \u00a35.5m signing from Deportivo four years ago, Xisco's arrival, on a reported salary of \u00a350,000 a week and at the instigation of the club's then football director Dennis Wise, prompted Kevin Keegan's exit as manager. Unwanted by Keegan's successors, Xisco has been loaned to Racing Santander and Deportivo but is now trying to finally make it on Tyneside. \"For the first time since I've been here Xisco has shown some signs of life,\" said Pardew. \"The pressure's not on him any more. I think the big fee weighted him down. He's been through a difficult time but he's sensing his confidence is coming back. I'm very pleased he got the hat-trick. I hope he can build on that.\" Although Pardew plans to rest several established players against the Belgian league leaders, the alarmingly foul-prone Cheik Tiot\u00e9, poised to begin a three-game domestic suspension soon following his sending-off at Sunderland on Sunday, is not among them. \"Cheik will face Brugge,\" said Pardew. \"I've spoken to him about his disciplinary record and his responsibility to Newcastle. I think he responded well.\" Newcastle United 4-3-3 Harper; Simpson, S Taylor, Williamson, Ferguson; Bigirimana, Tiot\u00e9, Anita; Shola Ameobi, Ciss\u00e9, Sammy Ameobi Club Brugge 4-3-3 Jorgacevic; Hoefkens, Almeback, Buysse, Jordi; Odjidja-Ofoe, Blondel, V\u00e1zquez; Vleminckx, Bacca, Lestienne Referee M Hansson Sweden"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
