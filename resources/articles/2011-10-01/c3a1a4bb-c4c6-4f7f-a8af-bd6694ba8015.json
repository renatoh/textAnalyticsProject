He believes new carbon-based materials can be created through nanotechnology that will open up new vistas in medicine and electronics. The full lecture will shortly be made available on the Royal Society website. Alok also reports last week's announcement of the winners of the Wellcome Trust Science Writing Prize in association with the Guardian and The Observer. The winning entry in the academic category was published on Friday in the Guardian, and the non-academic winner and runners-up will be published online in the coming weeks. Finally, Alok and Guardian science correspondent Ian Sample discuss some of this week's top science news including the reconstruction of the Black Death genome from DNA in 14th century skeletons and a new procedure designed to treat an inherited liver condition, turning skin cells into healthy liver cells.
