She had been due attend a traditional St David's Day ceremony in the city, presenting leeks to members of the 3rd Battalion. A palace spokeswoman said: \"The Queen will no longer visit Swansea tomorrow as she is experiencing symptoms of gastroenteritis. \"She will be assessed in the coming days. Her Majesty is currently spending the weekend at Windsor, as usual.\" On Thursday, the Queen presented Olympic athletes with honours in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace. She presented heptathlon winner Jessica Ennis with a CBE and knighted Dave Brailsford, Team GB's cycling boss. She is due to visit Italy next week with the Duke of Edinburgh, although whether that trip will still take place is unclear. The news follows several bouts of ill health suffered by the Duke of Edinburgh. Last year he was treated twice for bladder infections, and in 2011 he spent four nights in hospital after a successful procedure to clear a blocked coronary artery. The ceremony in Swansea is set to go ahead without the Queen. A council spokesman said: \"Due to minor illness, the Queen is unable to attend Saturday's event. \"The ceremony will continue as planned and will be carried out by the Lord Lieutenant of West Glamorgan, Mr Byron Lewis. \"The Lord Lieutenant will be met upon arrival at the Guildhall by Brigadier Philip Napier, Colonel of the Regiment.\" The Queen has rarely missed an official visit because of illness. She last cancelled an event in October, when she had to miss an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle due to chronic back pain. In 2011 she pulled out of a visit to the British Museum because of a cold, and a tour of Arsenal's new stadium in 2006 was cancelled after she strained her back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
