Their annual financial report says it had an income of $957m (\u00a3663m) last year, 94% of which was generated by television, marketing and sponsorship money raised from events such as the World Cup. Football's world governing body said it even made a profit of $16m (\u00a311m) in managing its assets. The organisation's equity now stands at $902m (\u00a3625m).
