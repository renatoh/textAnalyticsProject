It\u2019s not funny, is it? I mean, we don\u2019t laugh at people who fall off cliffs while taking selfies, do we? Anyway, a wave of hip and knee injuries among yoga instructors has led to concern. A leading physiotherapist, Benoy Mathew, has said he has seen a lot of injuries as a result of inexperienced teachers attempting the most complicated poses for the \u2019gram. God, it\u2019s all so spiritual, isn\u2019t it? So much part of yoga\u2019s 5,000-year-old tradition. Who hasn\u2019t been to a yoga class where madly competitive people contort themselves at the front while some of us lie at the back snoring? What qualifies some people to be yoga teachers I shall never know, apart from a week on a beach in Kerala and undiagnosed hypermobility. Of course, yoga is great if taught properly and sensitively; the very opposite of endless pictures of lithe young things in specious, sunset poses. \u201cLook at me,\u201d is not part of any meditative practice I understand. It is simply mindful flashing. The worst yoga teachers are surely the ones who demonstrate poses in front of stiff, horrified middle-aged people with little instruction except: \u201cBehold my toned abs.\u201d The second worst are the ones who speak a few words in Sanskrit and then offer nuggets of philosophy that are about as far from compassion as you can get. My favourite was at a class I attended with a woman who had just had a knee operation and was unable to sit in certain positions. \u201cWhat I notice,\u201d said the teacher, \u201cis that people with knee problems often have way too much ego.\u201d I caught the woman\u2019s eye. Oh, the ancient wisdom of the terminally up themselves. That universe is boundless. And breathe. \u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
