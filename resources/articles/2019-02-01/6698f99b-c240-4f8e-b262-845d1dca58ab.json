The 19-year-old McLaren driver will be the youngest British driver to take part in F1 when he makes his debut at the Australian Grand Prix in March and has made a controlled and confident start to his new career. Norris has already shown promise and he was able to exploit McLaren making a far stronger start in testing than they have in the previous four years. His time, set in the last hour of a day during which he completed an impressive 104 laps, was just over three-tenths down on Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari, who led the timesheets throughout. \u201cIt\u2019s good I managed to do some longer runs, good to know we can get through a whole day with no big problems,\u201d Norris said. \u201cBut it is only day two. We want to get through this test and identify any problems there might be and make sure we figure them out before Australia. It\u2019s good confidence for myself and for the team.\u201d He believes the team and car have made a step forward since their difficult 2018 season. \u201cThe motivation, how everyone works, seems to be going in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the niggles we have had to overcome have been ironed out. Everyone is working together in the correct way and everyone is very motivated.\u201d Williams are hopeful they will be able to run their car for the first time in testing on Wednesday. The team missed the first two days because their car was still being worked on at the factory. It is expected to arrive from the UK in the early hours of Wednesday morning and they are aiming to make it ready for the afternoon session. Ferrari were once again on top with Leclerc, in his first time behind the wheel for the team, putting in an impressive performance and racking up 157 laps. Lewis Hamilton took the Mercedes out in the morning, completing 74 laps of consistent running in 10th place. Daniel Ricciardo set some good times for Renault until part of his rear wing came off in the morning run, ending his session. Red Bull, too, looked competitive and reliable until Pierre Gasly went off having completed 92 laps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
