The series, based on the real-life adventures of the Yorkshire vet James Herriot, originally ran on BBC1 from 1978 to 1990, and is now being given a fresh interpretation by Channel 5. The six-part series, a co-production with the American broadcaster PBS, is due to start shooting on location in Yorkshire this year. The series, which includes a Christmas special, will air next year to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the original publication of Herriot\u2019s much-loved books. Sebastian Cardwell, the digital channel controller at Channel 5, said: \u201cJames Herriot has a special place in the heart of the public and the commission of this iconic drama series, against the stunning backdrop of the Yorkshire Dales, is set to bring joy to a new army of TV viewers. \u201cThe original books affectionately captured a unique slice of British life. In challenging times we hope the charming and heartwarming stories of community and compassion will resonate with new audiences.\u201d The production has not yet announced the casting for the lead role. Christopher Timothy played Herriot in the original series, which also starred Robert Hardy, Peter Davison, Lynda Bellingham and Carol Drinkwater. At its peak, All Creatures Great and Small pulled in audiences of more than 13 million. The new series will be created by Playground, the production company behind the hit dramas Howards End and Wolf Hall, with a promise to remain faithful to the books of Alf Wight, James Herriot\u2019s real name. \u201cIt is a responsibility we take very seriously,\u201d said Colin Callender, chief executive of Playground. \u201cThe series will embrace the fun and nostalgia of revisiting the England of the past, while celebrating Herriot\u2019s values that, despite all our current upheaval, still underpin British life today.\u201d The bucolic depiction of country life seems a far cry from the Channel 5 of old, the former home of Big Brother. Its schedule was once described as \u201cfilms, football and fucking\u201d. However, the broadcaster has made a return to quality drama in the past year under Ben Frow, Channel 5\u2019s director of programmes. This includes Cold Call, which is set in a woman\u2019s prison, and 15 Days, a murder mystery set at a Welsh farmhouse. In 2010, the BBC commissioned a three-part series, Young James, based on the earlier years of Herriot\u2019s career. It was filmed and set in Glasgow, the city where Wight learned his trade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
