At the Etihad Stadium for Monday night\u2019s match with Everton the manager can choose from Gabriel Jesus, Leroy San\u00e9, Bernardo Silva, Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva, Yaya Tour\u00e9, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Sergio Ag\u00fcero. After the 2-0 victory in their opening game at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Guardiola also mentioned Phil Foden, a 17-year-old who impressed in pre-season and was an unused substitute. If Guardiola\u2019s pursuit of Arsenal\u2019s Alexis S\u00e1nchez proves successful he will have a full XI at his disposal to fill a maximum of five places, if a three-centre-back system is used. It means an unwanted place on the bench again beckons for star names accustomed to a starter\u2019s jersey when Everton visit. At the Amex Stadium Sterling, San\u00e9 and Tour\u00e9 sat it out with Foden. But to select five forward-minded players out of the possible seven substitutes points to Guardiola\u2019s priorities and the challenge he faces in accommodating them all. Against Brighton Guardiola\u2019s solution was to squeeze an extra striker into an untypical 3\u20115\u20112 formation. For a coach whose questioning of centre-forwards moved him to deploy false No9s at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, choosing a front two in Jesus and Ag\u00fcero was an intriguing move. It also showed those who believe Guardiola to be an inflexible strategist that he can make tactical adjustments so long as they serve his vision of a relentless attacking machine. In this second season of Guardiola\u2019s tenure City simply must compete seriously for the Premier League. If he cannot claim that trophy he will at least need to win a cup after the lack of silverware last season, which featured a disappointing third\u2011place finish and a last\u201116 exit from the Champions League. For this quest Guardiola has used the transfer window to add a new first-choice goalkeeper, Ederson, three defenders \u2013 Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Danilo \u2013 and bolster his attack options with the \u00a343.6m acquisition of Bernardo Silva from Monaco. De Bruyne is one of Guardiola\u2019s few untouchables, alongside David Silva. After the Brighton match De Bruyne pointed to City\u2019s long campaign that could number \u201c60-65 matches\u201d and the need for strength in depth. But how much depth is too much? Sterling is one whose City career appears in the balance after his failure to convince Guardiola in 2016-17. San\u00e9 impressed more but may still have a fight to re-establish himself with Silva\u2019s arrival from Monaco. Asked if there can be too much competition Guardiola admitted it could become a headache: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Hopefully, they can understand that. Hopefully they will understand that at the big clubs you cannot have 11 players [in attack], so they have to compete with each other. For example, the last game in Brighton, Leroy [San\u00e9] didn\u2019t play from the beginning, it was a key point and I changed our dynamic a little bit in front. \u201cAnd, for example \u2013 Raz [Raheem Sterling] when he played minutes [coming on for the last 12] he played good as well. So in the Premier League the people who are 12, 13, 14 and play in the game, they are so important. When the game is in the last 15 or 20 minutes, the opponent is tired and we\u2019ve moved them [around] during the game, we can put in dynamic players like Bernardo Silva, Raz or San\u00e9. In another game maybe it\u2019s Sergio [Ag\u00fcero] or Gabriel [Jesus]. So it\u2019s a point where we can win games in the last minutes.\u201d An indicator that San\u00e9 and Sterling face a struggle as potential fall guys came in last April\u2019s draw at Middlesbrough. Guardiola fielded the same Ag\u00fcero-Jesus pairing as at Brighton in a 3-4-1-2 with which City struggled to a 2-2 draw. Explaining why neither had started, Guardiola said: \u201c[San\u00e9 and Sterling] are wingers and we have to help them with the full-backs in that position to close the crosses and they are not able to do that over 90 minutes, especially Raheem.\u201d Guardiola wants flexibility, so willrelish being able to switch between 3-5-2,3-4-1-2, 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1. As against Brighton, Guardiola\u2019s team brightened at the Riverside following shrewd utilisation of Sterling and San\u00e9, who each came on just after half-time. The key to keeping all of his attackers content will be success. Excluded players feel less inclined to rock the boat if the side is winning. Team spirit kicks in and there is little reason to knock on the manager\u2019s door and claim fortunes can be reversed if the disgruntled player is picked. Guardiola said: \u201cWe have many strikers, but we need this. We have four competitions and a lot of games. If we would play just one game a week, we would have less, not too many players. But with the competitions, we need all of them.\u201d City are again title favourites, which Guardiola shrugged off. \u201cIt\u2019s the same last season,\u201d he said. \u201cSo [at Bayern Munich] I won three Bundesligas in a row, two cups, reached three semi-finals of the Champions League \u2013 I felt that [being favourites] in Munich. I know I can handle it. I have to live with it. So when the journalists say: \u2018You are the favourite,\u2019 I accept that. When I lose and they say: \u2018You are not favourite,\u2019 I accept it too.\u201d Yet Guardiola insisted he will never change his ethos as he prepares a side aimed at overwhelming Everton. \u201cWe just have to try to win and we\u2019re going to see at the end of the season,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we win, people will say nice words but, if we don\u2019t win, people will say he\u2019s not able to train in the Premier League. It\u2019s simple like that.\u201d More complicated will be keeping all his top players on-message. Overcome that challenge and City could well be crowned champions in May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
