Five successive league defeats followed by this setback have left Villa's season in ruins and John Gregory under more pressure. In the absence of Gregory, who left immediately afterwards to watch an unnamed player, his coach Steve Harrison denied it was all doom and gloom. But although Villa are blessed with highly talented individuals collectively, they are under-achieving in a big way. By contrast, Leicester's progress continues to be greater than probably should be expected from the sum of the parts. Their winning goal, which prolonged an unbeaten run against Villa dating back 13 years summed it up. Damien Delaney, a 19-year-old, \u00a350,000 signing from Cork City capped a competent full debut by helping set up perennial substitute Arnar Gunnlaugs son to score with seven minutes remaining. The goal rounded off an eventful afternoon, scarred by two sendings-off and a series of personal vendettas in the first half, but then elevated to a cracking contest when both sides settled down to concentrate on their football. Gregory was left to reflect on his team selection. It was no surprise in view of his comments about David Ginola that the Frenchman was not even on the bench. Ginola turned his back on the tie, heading for home as soon as he found he was not in the squad - quite how a man with a reputation for going down too easily would have coped in the first hostile 45 minutes is anyone's guess. But the preference for Darius Vassell ahead of Dion Dublin was certainly called to account. Vassell hit the crossbar with a thumping header from Alan Wright's cross, but with little more than half an hour gone was sent off for a second yellow card - a clattering challenge on Andy Impey the second player to go, also for his second offence, was Leicester's Callum Davidson for a clash with Steven Staunton which provoked an ugly melee in the penalty box on the stroke of half-time. Taylor had no complaints about either decision from Uriah Rennie. 'They were poor challenges.' Harrison declined to comment on that aspect of the game. 'We are upset with the way the game panned out. That's all I'm prepared to say.' 'We had every chance to win this one. But our defending was poor. You can't expect to win with defending like that. We have sat down and talked about it.' Leicester went ahead three minutes before the break with Ade Akinbiyi released by Matt Elliott's long ball and a favourable rebound off David James. Staunton came across trying to close him down but was too late to prevent Akinbiyi scoring. The introduction of Julian Joachim after a two-month absence supplied a keener edge for Villa, who equalised with a as Joachim shook off the challenge of Gerry Taggart to drive low into the bottom corner. Gunnlaugsson's winner, driven in off the crossbar after Elliott touched a ball from Delaney into his path, was good enough to win any game. Annoyed Villa players believed there should have been more injury time available, but in their hearts they cannot have had too many complaints. 'Delaney has learned a lot today,' added Taylor. 'He got through a tremendous amount of work, won a lot of tackles and looks to be one for the future.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
