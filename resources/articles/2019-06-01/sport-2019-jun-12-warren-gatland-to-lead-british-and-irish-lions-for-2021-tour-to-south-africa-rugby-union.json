Gatland was on Wednesday confirmed as the Lions head coach for a third time and promptly brought an end to speculation he could replace Eddie Jones. Instead he wants a job with a Super Rugby side in 2021, which would strengthen his claims to coaching the All Blacks further down the line. Gatland also hit back at Jones\u2019s claims that coaching the Lions is \u201can ambassador job\u201d and \u201cthe last thing I want to do is spend eight weeks in a blazer\u201d. Those comments were perceived as Jones acknowledging he was not in contention for the Lions job after the Rugby Football Union, when extending his contract until 2021, said he would be free to accept the role. That extension has complicated the RFU\u2019s search for a successor because it contains a break clause if England fail to reach the semi-finals of this year\u2019s World Cup and there is every chance Jones will depart regardless of how they fare in Japan. But Gatland, who will leave his role as Wales head coach after the tournament following 11 years in charge, is not interested. He said: \u201cI can tell you definitively now I will not be coaching England, there is no way, unless I put a blazer on or something! I think my coaching path is going to take a different direction. I finish with Wales and then I\u2019ve got 12 months \u2026 the whole focus is then on the Lions and then my plan then is to go back to New Zealand and hopefully there is an opportunity for some Super Rugby.\u201d Following the 2017 series draw with the All Blacks, Gatland, frustrated over the lack of preparation time and the treatment he received in the New Zealand press, in effect ruled himself out of future tours. His change of heart means he will undertake the role full-time from next August\u2013 he may accept a brief consultancy role elsewhere between the World Cup and then \u2013 and play a leading role in finalising the tour schedule. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you could coach a Lions team in a blazer,\u201d said Gatland, in response to Jones\u2019s jibes. \u201cI was bemused by that. It is one of the hardest things that I\u2019ve ever had to do as a coach. Maybe that was a subtle way of ruling himself out of contention.\u201d Despite Gatland\u2019s protestations in 2017, the 2021 tour will be more condensed \u2013 eight matches over five weeks rather than 10 over six \u2013 and the Premiership final is again set to take place just a week before the Lions\u2019 first match. Gatland is hopeful that, like the Pro14, the Premiership agrees to reschedule its final a week earlier, while he admitted he will look for a degree of continuity among his back-room staff and that he is likely to take a smaller squad of around 38, earmarking Alun Wyn Jones and Owen Farrell as potential captains. \u201cEveryone is fighting for their own corner,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt 10 games was about right. Maybe in the future it can change [because] we are at the minimum at the moment. I\u2019ll be fighting as hard as I possibly can to give us the best possible preparation to give us a chance to be in the best possible shape for that first Test.\u201d With the Test venues still to be confirmed, Gatland will also push for one Test to be played at altitude, whereas South Africa will want two, and he would ideally not have a midweek fixture before the first Test. If there is, he is likely to call on players from outside the squad despite being widely criticised for doing so with the \u201cGeography Six\u201d in 2017. \u201cThe biggest challenge I have is how do I protect that 23 for the first Test? You don\u2019t want players sitting on the bench or [playing in the midweek game] being a part of the Test side. You need that time together to hopefully have a full week of preparation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
