Last Wednesday, Bryant took a private jet from Los Angeles where he stars for one of the most glamorous sports franchises in the United States, the LA Lakers basketball team, to the small but affluent Eagle County where he appeared before Judge Frederick Gannett, accused of raping a 19-year-old hotel concierge. Legally, the hearing was a formality. In media terms, it was cataclysmic. The traffic jam of satellite trucks outside the court - 40, stretching the length of a dozen basketball courts - gave a sense of how big this story will play across American in the coming months, but for anyone seeking confirmation there was always the formula; the number of journalists who had applied for the 22 seats in the courtroom - 540; the length of Wednesday's hearing (in seconds) - 426. During those 426 seconds, Bryant, dressed in an expensive linen suit, flanked by his expensive lawyers, said just two words ('No sir') before flying back to his LA home, leaving the TV anchors, legal analysts and social commentators to dissect and speculate for hour upon end. Seldom have so many words been expended on so little action, although some credit is due to Bob Jarvis, a sports law lecturer, who when asked why there was so much interest in this story, matched Bryant's courtroom brevity with: 'This case has it all.' He's right. This case covers modern America's every obsession: celebrity, violence, sport, culture, crime, sex and money. Then there is, as always in America, race. Already, comparisons are being made between Bryant and OJ Simpson, the former NFL star who was acquitted of murdering his wife in 1995 after a long-running court case that divided public opinion along racial lines. This case shows no signs of similarly polarising the country; not yet. That could change if Bryant's legal team fails to move the case from Eagle County, where the potential jury pool is 96 per cent white and - if some reports are to be believed - the alleged victim has friends, colleagues and relations on every street. The accused, on the other hand, is known in Eagle County only as he is known elsewhere in America; a sporting superstar. Like David Beckham in this country, Bryant is a marketing icon in his homeland. Only Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and now LeBron James can outstrip his off-the-field earnings, said last year to have exceeded $15 million. A month before his fateful visit to Colorado, he signed a $40m shoe contract with Nike. All is now at risk. Barely a week goes by in America without an accusation of criminal behaviour being made against a professional athlete. Countless books have been written on the subject by authors who never dreamed they might one day have to include a chapter on Bryant. He was a template against whom up-and-coming sportsmen in the US were measured; a brilliant athlete adored by millions but quietly spoken and respectful, a multi-linguist, a happily married man with a young child, whose only previous scrape with the law was a ticket for speeding. The accusation of rape, which carries a maximum sentence in Colorado of life, is shocking enough but it is the dissonance between Bryant's public persona and the violence of the alleged crime that has so stunned the country. It is also what has fuelled a desperate media campaign by the 24-year-old to shore up that persona in the period before the case comes to court. The defence began early last month, when rumours surfaced that Bryant was being investigated for sexual assault on a woman during a visit to Colorado for knee surgery. Initially, he denied ever meeting his accuser. But when the rumours of a police investigation were confirmed, he changed his story. Flanked by his lawyers and his wife, Vanessa - whom he described as 'the air that I breath' - he tearfully admitted to adultery, but said he was innocent of any crime. A story leaked that he had bought Vanessa a $4m diamond ring as a peace offering. Finally, there was a press conference during which he said: 'You know me guys. You know I wouldn't do this.' For many Americans watching at home, particularly those who deify their sporting heroes, this was all the convincing they needed. But the journalists in the room were less impressed. Many had covered Bryant's basketball exploits for years and had come to think of him as obsessive and aloof. Instead of answering the desperate superstar in the affirmative, they responded with: But do we know the real Kobe Bryant? Joe 'Jelly Bean' Bryant was a good basketball player, a journeyman who played in the NBA (the National Basketball Association) before finishing his career in Italy. He was determined that his son would be a great player. 'Joe was networked into the NBA and knew what it would take for Kobe to make the pros,' says Norm Eavenson, one of the country's leading basketball scouts. 'Every step was planned for him, and Kobe was the beneficiary of Joe's knowledge and protection.' Bryant Jnr took the game up seriously when he was 13, practising with one of his father's old teams, the Philadelphia 76ers. Joe's faith was rewarded; within a couple of years Kobe was recognised as one of the best young players in the country. In the 1990s, it was normal for promising basketball players to play for a college team for four years before turning pro. With his family, the 17-year-old prodigy held a press conference to announce he was going straight to the NBA. As many expected, he struggled against the bigger, stronger players in the professional game but those who predicted his talent would be irreparably crushed by the experience failed to take into account Bryant's commitment and will-power. 'I have not coached another player with a greater work ethic,' a former coach said. 'To my knowledge there is no life experience that Kobe has had which he hasn't then used to improve himself,' said another. But what serves as commendable self-knowledge by one colleague, can be interpreted as self-obsession by others. He is not liked by those in a position to know him best - his teammates. Indeed, none of them has made the effort to pub licly support him in his time of need. What is beyond debate, however, is that over the last five years, Bryant has turned himself into, arguably, the world's best basketball player. In tandem with Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers' other superstar, he has carried his team to three NBA championships, as well as becoming one of the most marketable celebrities in the US. Publicly, Nike, along with his other sponsors, including Coca-Cola, have maintained they will stand by him until the case has reached its conclusion. Privately, they must share the concerns of the countless sports marketing analysts who believe that Bryant's name will never recover from appearing in the same sentence as the word 'rape'. The trial is not expected to start for another six months while each side prepares its case; a lengthy process which might serve the purposes of truth and justice embodied in the US constitution but does nothing to slake the thirst of the media beast. In the US, unlike the UK, there are no limits to what can be said about a pending court case, although - as in the UK - the identity of the alleged victim in rape cases is legally protected. Not that this stopped one radio host from naming a 19-year-old from Eagle County as Bryant's accuser. However, it was the wrong woman. At the more 'respectable' end of the media market, the cable networks have been reduced to a meagre diet of self-serving leaks from the defence and prosecution teams, and endless reappraisals of the relative merits of each side's case. For what it's worth - not much - those who believe Bryant is innocent argue that the prosecution will have a hard time proving his guilt in what is essentially a 'he- said-she-said' case. Those who think Bryant is guilty hint that the district attorney's office in Eagle County would never have embarked on a prosecution against someone as high-profile as Kobe Bryant unless they had irrefutable evidence. Meanwhile, there are those who are happy to wait for a jury to deliver its verdict but who are aware that nothing succeeds in the American legal system like wealth, power and celebrity. For this silent but cynical minority there was this nugget delivered last week by Mike Goodbee, a former district attorney in Eagle County: 'Here's a guy who makes $30-$40m a year. My budget when I was the DA in Eagle County was $2.1m. Kobe makes that amount of money in four games of basketball.'
