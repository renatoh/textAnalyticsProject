One ought to be used now to seeing older women being celebrated \u2013 and paid \u2013 as archetypes of beauty. Sophia Loren's been at it for years, Twiggy was credited with reviving Marks &amp; Spencer when she started appearing in their advertisements, and the only cavil people really have with Madonna is that she will insist on behaving as if she were the only woman over 40 who still has breasts. (Actually very annoying if, like me, you've carelessly managed to lose one along the way.) Yet, I can't help it. I still find the whole phenomenon, whereby women can choose not to become invisible from middle-age o'nwards, to be inordinately pleasing. When I was a child, one was still expected to embrace the shampoo and set at 35, then retain it until death. It wasn't uncommon to see old ladies sporting blue, purple or pink rinses on their white hair. I say \"old ladies\", but they were probably Rossellini's age, or younger. At 21 years old, I dyed my long hair raven black. Then, the night before an important interview, I decided it was \"too goth\" and tried to bleach it blonde. It went an astonishing shade of fluorescent orange, and I didn't get the job. The hair was in such a state that I had to have it all cut off. I agonised about growing it again, and remember thinking: \"What's the point? I'll be 30 when it's the length I want it to be, and I'll be too old for long hair.\" The madness. Now, I'm growing it again, at nearly 50, after I lost my crowning glory in the same incident that severed my mammary. Of course, one has to be aware of the 16:61 phenomenon, whereby glossy-locked slenderness looks youthful from the back, but terrifies children when one turns round. Yet this too has its compensations, chiefly the way it stuns into silence enthusiastic young men passing in white vans showing their appreciation of the fairer sex in a rather intrusive way. Never stops being funny."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
