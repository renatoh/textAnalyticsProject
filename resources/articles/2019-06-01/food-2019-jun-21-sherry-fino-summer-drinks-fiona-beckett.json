You\u2019d be justified in thinking that sherry was only a Christmas drink, but as anyone who\u2019s ever been to Jerez (a fabulous city) will know (or indeed anywhere in the so-called \u201csherry triangle\u201d at the tip of southern Spain), it\u2019s ace in summer, too. Why, we wine writers wail, don\u2019t people love it more? Especially given that the quality is consistently high, and prices, particularly of own-label sherries, are ridiculously low? The main reason, I think, is because it\u2019s dry \u2013 often painfully so. And it\u2019s not all that fruity, either. Why would you drink a glass of fino (generally a small glass, so it doesn\u2019t go very far), for instance, when you could have a glass of ros\u00e9 or a G&amp;T instead? In its 1960s heyday, sherry was more often than not sweet, and the competition from other drinks was derisory. Blue Nun or sherry? Sherry won hands down. The other reason, given that the drinks industry thrives on innovation, could be that nothing much happens in the sherry world. True, there are the new(ish) en rama sherries (limited-edition, unfiltered bottlings), but they\u2019re even more challenging to drink. Otherwise, it all chugs on much as it has done for the past 30 years. So what\u2019s to be done? Well, at this time of year, focus on the lighter styles such as fino and manzanilla for a start. In fact, I\u2019d say take a leaf out of the locals\u2019 book and drink a rebujito, which is fino mixed with lemonade (traditionally Sprite or 7-Up, but you may want to upgrade to a premium mixer). Sherry and tonic, jocularly known as a She &amp; T, is also delicious. And if you\u2019re drinking your sherry straight, enjoy it with those tricky foods that defeat most still wines \u2013 artichokes, anchovies and olives, to name just three. That\u2019s because saltiness and bitterness make dry sherry shine; it\u2019s also a brilliant pairing with seafood. Perhaps, however, the problem is that we\u2019re also expecting too much of sherry. I happily pop into my local tapas bar in Bristol for a glass at the counter and a chat with the barman, much as I might in Spain. Or I pour myself a glass on a quiet night in and sip it while reading a good book. Maybe we try to make sherry too social when it should be a quiet, solitary pleasure. Eureka! Could be I\u2019ve nailed the marketing pitch: enjoy a slow sherry. You heard it here first. Four sherries to sip in the sun Williams Humbert Bodegas Lustau Fino en Rama 2018 Jerez de la Frontera \u00a317.95 Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, 15%. Rich, complex, nutty fino for hardcore aficionados. Slick label, too. Alegria Manzanilla Superior \u00a35.49 a half-bottle Waitrose, \u00a38.50 Wine Society, 15%. Distinctively sharp and salty sherry from the coastal town of Sanlucar. Try with fried fish or salt cod croquetas. Inocente Fino Valdespino \u00a38.57 a half-bottle Alexander Hadleigh \u00a38.75 Lea &amp; Sandeman (or \u00a37.95 in a case of 12), 15%. Classic, single-vineyard fino. Dry but nicely smooth and rounded. Great in a She &amp; T. Blueprint Amontillado \u00a37.29 Waitrose, 18.5%. Off-dry, old-school, with a hint of raisin sweetness. Drink with hot tapas such as fried chorizo or with cheese (gouda is particularly good). \u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
