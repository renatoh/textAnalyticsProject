Of course, Davison is an extreme example. But all over the world, campaigners for various causes are still breaking the rules to make a point. Take this week for example. First there was Tuesday's stand-off at Stansted Airport with over 50 campaigners from anti-aviation network Plane Stupid storming the runway, constructing a makeshift barrier out of fence panels and chaining themselves to it with handcuffs and bicycle locks (some things never go out of style). Flights were cancelled, passengers frustrated and, somewhere up in the Earth's atmosphere, the world was saved from several hundred tonnes of climate change emissions. Then on Thursday it was revealed that a mystery saboteur had single-handedly managed to break into Kingsnorth power station and crash a giant 500MW turbine before casually making his way out again - leaving a calling card of an old bedsheet festooned with the words \"no new coal\" artfully written in Gaffa tape, and reducing UK carbon emissions by 2% for the four hours the power station was halted. But just how effective is direct action? It depends on the reasons behind the protest, according to Ben Stewart of Greenpeace, one of six people arrested last year for climbing the 250 foot chimney of Kingsnorth power station and painting the prime minister's name in big white letters down the side of it. Direct action protests are a way of speeding up change and getting people to listen by showing society leaders that you are willing to break the rules for a cause you believe in. The idea is to engage in non-violent creative confrontation to spark a debate to bring about change. Stewart admitted it can be frustrating for campaigners when the reasons behind the protest inevitably get sidelined in the media by the security issue: just how had over 50 people managed to get onto the runway of the UK's third biggest airport? How did one person manage to break into the most heavily guarded power station in Britain? How did five people manage to stage a rooftop protest at the House of Commons? \"However we understand that the media have to ask those kinds of questions,\" Stewart says. \"That's their job.\" There are also pitfalls to campaigning outside the law. As well as the personal risks - such as arrest, injury or worse - there is the danger of people misinterpreting your actions, resulting in public vilification. Leo Hickman has noted how on the morning of the Stansted protest he heard people on the radio likening the campaigners to Islamist terrorists which, when you start to think about it, is actually such a preposterous statement it's not even worth benefiting with a response (especially given that Plane Stupid is a organisation founded by pacifists who met on anti-Iraq war protest marches). \"As far as the media are concerned, once you've broken the law you don't have a reputation to lose,\" says Stewart. \"They think they can say what they like about you. I've heard some crazy stuff about Greenpeace planning to plant bombs to reduce the world's population and that sort of thing.\" It goes to show how direct action protests can sometimes cause more harm than good, discrediting the organisation behind the protest and deflecting attention from environmental issue itself. However, the UK press have been relatively sympathetic to Plane Stupid Stansted invaders, because they have been so articulate in conveying the reasons behind their protest and getting people to relate to that. And the mystery Kingsnorth saboteur has been awarded the nickname of \"the green Banksy\"; a superhero title, of sorts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
