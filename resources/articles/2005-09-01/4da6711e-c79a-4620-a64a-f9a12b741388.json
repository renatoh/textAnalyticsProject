Where Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday grandstanded, this is a downbeat look at the pressures bearing down on a college team and their decent coach, Billy Bob Thornton. There's more shoulder padding here than in an entire series of Dynasty; we're in desolate-looking Odessa, Texas, where brass bands are always playing Dixie, teams recite the Lord's Prayer at half-time and a woman's place is in the home or in a short skirt with pom-poms. Director Peter Berg keeps it very busy, but it succumbs eventually to the earnest life lessons that are the stuff of US sports movies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
