When he tinkled away All I Ask of You from The Phantom of the Opera, Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda responded enthusiastically and Lloyd Webber challenged him to a playoff. Miranda sang back Everything\u2019s Alright from Jesus Christ Superstar. Now, Nile Rodgers has joined in the play-off, too. The Chic man tweeted that he was taking up the \u201ccomposers in quarantine challenge\u201d after being \u201cstuck in this house for 15 days\u201d. Playing guitar, Rodgers then whips through Heaven on Their Minds, Judas\u2019s solo from the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. Addressing Lloyd Webber, he says: \u201cyou tell me how much I messed this up!\u201d Rodgers ends the song at the line, \u201cAnd believe me / My admiration for you has not died\u201d \u2013 perhaps highlighting his appreciation of the British composer. Lloyd Webber is then challenged to perform Get Lucky, Rodgers\u2019 hit single with Daft Punk. \u201cI can\u2019t rival your guitar playing,\u201d says Lloyd Webber before offering a few variations on the chorus, including as a piano concerto, a grand waltz and a Phantom-style organ version. (\u201cSorry about that Nile,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the Phantom did his best.\u201d) Rodgers responds: \u201cI\u2019m going #Gershwin or #RichardRodgers on you. You don\u2019t have to take it as a challenge but let\u2019s see what you do after I play the next song.\u201d This week, it was announced that a selection of Lloyd Webber musicals will be released weekly for free on the YouTube channel The Shows Must Go On, starting on Friday with Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and followed by Jesus Christ Superstar, starring Tim Minchin and Melanie C, on 10 April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
