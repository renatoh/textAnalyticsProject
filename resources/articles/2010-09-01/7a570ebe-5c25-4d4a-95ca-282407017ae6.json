We're rubbish, but at least we admit it!\" That was the rallying cry from Labour's new leader yesterday. The party, having chosen the spare Miliband, was fearful that he might be awful, a geek tragedy. The fact that he wasn't bad brought them stomping to their feet after a speech that sloshed and sprayed his predecessors with scorn. Gosh, the last government was a disaster, it seems. The City was allowed to run amok, immigration was ignored, they pretended they could end boom and bust, and as for Iraq, don't get him started. The conference listened to this passage, which could have appeared in the Tory manifesto, in what would have been silence except for the clamourous TV feed. In the hall itself you could have heard a piano drop. The first cheers came when he protested at how Labour had allowed so many post offices and pubs to close. They cheered a third time when he had kind words for another ancient, much-loved part of our national heritage: Ken Livingstone. It was Labour's first chance to get the feel of their new leader. He blinks a lot, roughly once a second, and in time to his hand movements, so it looks as if his eyelids and wrists are connected by a gossamer thread. Like his brother he has an asymmetrical mouth; the right side makes an O while the left side remains closed, so that he resembles a man who has just found half a maggot in the apple he's eating. More than ever he resembles a newly promoted maitre d' in an upmarket restaurant. He started off by signalling to the audience, as if to say that our table was ready. He looks very determined, but the determined look is dangerously close to a scowl. The panda eyes, spotted by Steve Bell, are hooded. \"Your table is ready. But I cannot promise you that you will like your table. \"Nor can I pledge that you will like the food. And you most certainly will not like the bill. But I implore you \u2013 follow me anyway! And the waitress will be along to take your drinks orders.\" He began with the now traditional encomium to his brother, \"an extraordinary person\" who had made an \"inspiring\" speech the day before. But the faintest note of bitterness crept in. Some people had claimed he was more leftwing than his brother. But, \"on the day I stole his football, he was so angry he nationalised my train set\". We learned something from that story: that he can't deliver a joke. No matter. He raced on to denounce \"old thinking\" by which the party had been trapped. By this, he evidently meant Blair and Brown, neither of whom were present to hear their chastisement. A new generation had taken over, he said, many times. He denounced \"instant results, instant votes, instant popularity, X Factor politics \u2026 we can't be imprisoned by focus groups\". It would be hard to imagine a more direct attack on his two predecessors, especially T Blair. (Though he did promise to take the party on \"a journey\". I thought, great title for a book - could be a bestseller.) I bet it took several focus groups to come up with the conclusion that focus groups are unpopular. And the peroration was pure focus group. Focus groups invariably show that people like optimistic politicians. He made Pollyanna look like Victor Meldrew. All Labour leaders had been optimists, he said. Even the otherwise airbrushed \"Tony and Gordon\". \"So let's be humble about our past!\" he declared. (When did the word \"humble\" come to mean \"proud\"?). A new generation had taken over, he mentioned for about the 342nd time, like a pub bore who says \"and another thing\" before telling you again what he's already told you. At last it was over. He hoped we'd enjoyed our meal \u2013 and would tell our friends."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
