The day after cancelling I found that the bank had taken \u00a36,000 from my current account and given me an overdraft for \u00a35,212. I complained and was given an appointment, but when I turned up I was told it would be better to have the adviser there in person. I was given another date, but the adviser phoned saying not to worry as my money would be returned. I heard nothing and asked again to meet the adviser. This time he drafted a letter for me to sign. I didn't want to since it included something about me agreeing to close the bond and being subject to a financial penalty. He said it was normal procedure and the only way I would get my money back. The bombshell dropped when NatWest wrote that, as I had closed the bond, I was liable to pay a \u00a3587 penalty. GY, London NatWest simply ignored your instructions to cancel the investment. It admits you suffered a financial loss and is putting you back to where you would have been if it had never recommended the investment. It is refunding the penalty payment plus interest and adding \u00a3100 compensation.
