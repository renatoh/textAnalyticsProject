It has been even less forthcoming to 2,000 Guineas winners. There have been some agonising near-misses, most memorably when Rock Of Gibraltar came up a stride or two short in 2002, and the desperate end to George Washington\u2019s career when he suffered a fatal injury on the dirt at Monmouth Park, thus the 2,000 Guineas remains the only English Classic without a winner on the Breeders\u2019 Cup\u2019s roll of honour. So both horse and rider will be looking to break unfortunate streaks when Kameko makes the ninth and final start of his career in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Mile at Keeneland on Saturday. Andrew Balding\u2019s colt is the likely favourite at around 4-1, a point in front of Chad Brown\u2019s Uni \u2013 the winner of the race at Santa Anita 12 months ago \u2013 and win or lose, he will be settling into his new life as a stallion, at Tweenhills stud in Gloucestershire, by Monday morning. \u201cHe will be coming straight to Tweenhills from the airport when he lands,\u201d David Redvers, racing manager for the Qatar Racing team, which owns Kameko, said this week, \u201cso he\u2019ll be coming to do the job he\u2019s earned.\u201d How much breeders will be charged for Kameko\u2019s services, however, has yet to be decided, and a win on Saturday could potentially make a seven-figure difference to his \u2013 or, rather, Qatar Racing\u2019s \u2013 earnings over his stallion career. It would be harsh to suggest that Kameko will have left something out on the track if he does not land the Mile, since he has recorded Group One wins at both two and three, including a Newmarket Classic. And yet there is still an air of unfinished business about him, thanks to an ambitious but so far largely unrewarded campaign after the Guineas success. The owners took a big chance on his stamina and ran him in what proved to be the strangest Derby that anyone can recall. Kameko was a very creditable fourth. He then had no luck at all back at a mile in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood, again finishing fourth but with plenty of running left. Then he made a big move on Ghaiyyath in the International Stakes to look like a serious danger two out, before the effort told and his stamina ran out. Fourth yet again. But there was much to admire in his prep race for the Breeders\u2019 Cup, as Kameko gave weight to older horses in the Joel Stakes at Newmarket and still prevailed by half a length. Murphy, meanwhile, will go to post with his status as Britain\u2019s champion jockey confirmed for another year, but only disappointment on his Breeders\u2019 Cup record so far. In fact, he is still waiting for his first winner inthe US, though he has an outside chance to get on the board via The Lir Jet, his mount in the Juvenile Turf on Friday evening. But Kameko is his first Breeders\u2019 Cup favourite, and the colt\u2019s chance has been improved by a draw in stall two, with Ryan Moore and Circus Maximus \u2013 often a front-runner \u2013 on his inside against the rail. Other potential frontrunners \u2013 notably Halladay, in 10, and Factor This (13) \u2013 are drawn much wider. If Circus Maximus breaks well, as he generally does, Murphy should be able to get into his slipstream around the first turn and sit a little closer to the pace than he might in a similar race in Europe. Positioning is immensely important in races around a tight American mile \u2013 as Rock Of Gibraltar\u2019s gallant failure 18 years ago proved \u2013 but Murphy has been given a real chance to sit where he wants to be and pick his moment to strike. But it was still typical of Murphy to suggest on Thursday, probably with a smile, that \u201call the hard work is done now\u201d, even though Kameko did look in exceptional condition as he worked down the Keeneland straight. For Kameko\u2019s jockey, the hard work is just about to begin, in a headlong two-minute dash that could finally see a 2,000 Guineas winner walking into the top enclosure after a race at the Breeders\u2019 Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
