Beating Barcelona was one thing; overcoming Monaco and levering themselves closer to the surprise Ligue 1 leaders, Marseille, would have made for a useful double statement after an unspectacular start to the season. But the Monaco substitute Anthony Martial\u2019s close-range equaliser, in the second minute of stoppage time, put paid to the momentum that Lucas Moura\u2019s 71st-minute goal seemed to have confirmed, leaving the home side seven points off top spot and giving their visitors\u2019 league campaign a timely foothold too. PSG\u2019s sharply bankrolled ascent to Europe\u2019s top table has not been greeted with unreserved enthusiasm by neutrals, so their enthralling 3-2 win over the Catalans in midweek must have felt like a point proved and Parc des Princes felt as if it was ready to ride a new wave. Perhaps their team had just cut loose for once and for all. Regardless, this did not seem quite like the clash of arrivistes presented 12 months ago, when Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Falcao scored in a 1-1 draw and this was Europe\u2019s stand-out fixture on a Sunday night. Neither was on the pitch this time, one through injury and the other ploughing a new furrow in Manchester. Ezequiel Lavezzi, Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Toulalan and Dimitar Berbatov were other enforced absentees from sides that have not yet threatened a repeat of last year\u2019s two-horse race, Monaco in particular struggling to react to a summer of harsh financial realities and starting this match in the bottom half. PSG were unbeaten in 10 competitive matches this season, though, and they began unyieldingly enough, looking to play through the middle of a compact Monaco 4-3-3. Marco Verratti, every pass bursting with information from the off, was lock-picker in chief but missed the first chance himself, shooting over seven minutes in when Javier Pastore\u2019s cut-back found him in space. A Monaco midfield three of Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, Geoffrey Kondogbia and Tiemou\u00e9 Bakayoko \u2013 the latter starting his first game since the opening day \u2013 was an imposing nut to crack and, for all their control of the midfield possession, PSG\u2019s most incisive moments came when the ball was worked wide quickly. On one such occasion Pastore should have headed Gregory van der Wiel\u2019s right-sided delivery towards goal but failed with the unselfish option, an attempt to find Edinson Cavani; on another, the left-back Maxwell combined intricately with Verratti but Blaise Matuidi was thwarted by Andrea Raggi as he shaped to shoot. The clearest sight of goal had the least prepossessing end, when another Maxwell centre would have given Matuidi the simplest of headed finishes had Cavani not glanced the ball away from his team-mate. David Luiz and Ricardo Carvalho have Chelsea pedigree but the defending on both sides verged on the chaotic when the player in possession was pressed. The former was sharp to deny the rangy Lucas Ocampos but Monaco always posed something more than a distant threat and almost took the lead two minutes before half-time. Moutinho crossed precisely for Yannick Ferreira Carrasco, who wrapped his left foot round the ball cleanly but watched as it rebounded from Salvatore Sirigu\u2019s crossbar. Verratti, whose influence had waned after a near-faultless first half-hour, did not emerge after the interval and his replacement, the 21-year-old winger Jean-Christophe Bahebeck, extended Danijel Subasic for the first time when his cross-shot was palmed over. Layvin Kurzawa, Monaco\u2019s outstandingly athletic left-back, found himself alone at the far post when Sirigu was beaten by a right-sided cross but Van der Wiel blocked on the line with his heel. When a goal arrived it owed plenty to the initiative of Bahebeck, who reached the byline and centred for Moura to finish from six yards. With 19 minutes left there was time for a response from Monaco, but the home side had barely been pressured when, after a couple of crosses had not been cleared properly and a shot from Kondogbia had been blocked, the ball eventually fell to Martial in front of goal. He could not miss and perhaps it was right that both sides\u2019 flaws were equally reflected in the scoreline."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
