But in the 21st century, this term could be reclaimed, shedding its pejorative clothing and emerging instead as a positive expression of Spain's enlightened attitude towards immigrant workers. Spain has one of the most liberal immigration policies in the EU, with few restrictions on the number of foreign nationals working and living in the country. In Germany, by comparison, short-term migrant work is plentiful but long-term opportunities scarce, according to the Polish workers in the UK I have spoken to. The Spanish have experienced the sort of influx of immigrants that would scare other EU nations witless. More than 4 million people, a third from Latin America, have moved to Spain since 2000. At the beginning of 2006 there were more than 500,000 Moroccans and 370,000 Romanians registered in the country. In December, the government of Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero announced that in 2007 it would be recruiting and training 180,000 immigrants in their countries of origin to meet Spain's demand for labour and stem illegal immigration. The only blot on this policy is that fewer than 100 workers will be hired from Senegal - from where thousands of migrants set sail each year to the Canary Islands, with many drowning en route. The Spanish public has generally tolerated immigration and the country hasn't experienced the degree of social tension witnessed in parts of Britain and France. This has been reflected in Spain's politics and media, in which jingoistic, shrill, anti-immigration rhetoric is rare. This could change if the population starts believing the number of immigrants is becoming unmanageable or if there is a major downturn in the economy. Over the past decade, Spain's economy has grown faster than any other in the eurozone - expanding on average by 3.7% a year since 1998, according to the International Monetary Fund. The average in Germany over the same period has been 1.3% a year, though some of that sluggishness stems from reunification in 1989. The Spanish are spurning jobs in booming industries such as agriculture, hospitality and construction. The vacuum is being filled by foreign nationals. Although the economic impact of immigration in Spain, as elsewhere, would be virtually impossible to calculate, the success of the economy cannot be separated from the input of its large immigrant labour force. The same is true in the UK, which has also done well in terms of economic growth (averaging 2.7% a year since 1998, says the IMF). In that period, immigration has added between \u00a312bn and \u00a318bn to Gordon Brown's Treasury coffers, says the economic forecasting body Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, which adds that workers from the new EU member states, such as Poland, are reducing the UK's trade deficit by an extra \u00a31bn a year. The National Institute Economic Review goes further, attributing a third of the UK's economic growth in 2004-05 to immigrants from the new EU states. There are, of course, winners and losers. Exploitation of immigrant workers exists - and Spain, like Britain, can be accused of turning a blind eye at times. But the biggest economic beneficiaries are immigrant workers, employers and consumers. Immigration has caused acute problems - such as pressure on housing and public services, and social tension - in parts of the UK, and may do in Spain soon. But as Michael O'Higgins, chairman of the Audit Commission, pointed out this year, there are solutions. And a number of local governments and other organisations are tackling the issues with vigour. Maybe when it comes to immigration, we should be advocating Spanish practices."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
