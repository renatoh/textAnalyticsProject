A lot of songwriters I\u2019ve spoken to just aren\u2019t getting inspired at the moment. I did try. I wrote a song called Wash Your Hands and thought: \u201cI\u2019d better put the guitar down now.\u201d That\u2019s why I decided to start hosting listening parties on Twitter instead, which I\u2019ve been doing every night from 9pm with the hashtag #timstwitterlisteningparties. We pick an album and listen together at a set time \u2013 9pm or 10pm \u2013 with commentary from one of the artists involved. The first week I did it we had Blur, Ride, Franz Ferdinand and Oasis \u2013 Bonehead did the commentary for that one. As soon as we started, it had become a thing. One of the maddest things was seeing it as the top trend on Twitter. Everyone who\u2019s taken part so far has said it\u2019s like doing a gig. There\u2019s the trepidation beforehand, then an hour of craziness, and finally a period where you\u2019re kind of decompressing. The only difference with this is that nobody\u2019s nicking your beers! We\u2019ve done about 30 so far, including our debut album Some Friendly, and there have been some great moments. My personal highlight is me not realising that I\u2019d played Reading festival in 1999 \u2013 I still can\u2019t remember it now, even though people have been telling me exactly what happened. I also loved Dave Rowntree revealing his collection of laminated artefacts from the Parklife era \u2013 old photos, gig tickets. He made so much effort and that really upped everything because the listening party became a visual thing. The Cribs did one for Men\u2019s Needs, Women\u2019s Needs, Whatever and were showing their old tour diaries and lyric sheets. Those are the kind of insights you don\u2019t often get in a magazine \u2013 bands probably wouldn\u2019t want to show those at the time of release anyway, but now there\u2019s a bit of history involved and they feel more relaxed. What I like is that it\u2019s giving people the opportunity to listen to an album in its entirety again. Musicians I talk to, even the younger artists, all want to make an album that\u2019s a masterpiece, that has a theme running through it, a start and a finish. That has been crushed in a way because people felt they didn\u2019t have enough time on their hands. But now all we have is time, so it\u2019s a beautiful thing for this moment. We\u2019ve had listeners from all over: New Zealand, Japan and even Antarctica. Part of the reason we do them at 10pm is because that\u2019s when Japan is waking up. The other reason is because that\u2019s when the 10 o\u2019clock news is on, and I wanted people to have an alternative to that \u2013 you can watch the news at any time these days; this is a way of offering up an alternative good time instead. It\u2019s not the only thing I\u2019m doing at the moment. I\u2019ve got a new solo album, I Love the New Sky, coming out in May. I spoke to the label about whether we should postpone it, but we agreed it was a good time to put music out, to have something to look forward to. I\u2019ve also been doing some home schooling with my six-year-old. But I\u2019m not a teacher and I don\u2019t think I should try to be. Instead we just go for a walk every day and talk about volcanoes, tornadoes, the coronavirus and the environment. That\u2019s not a bad start, is it? He\u2019s also got into wrestling, so we do a bit of that. But most of my time is spent on these listening parties. I\u2019m always working on them. All day I\u2019m getting direct messages and emails and I\u2019m normally up until midnight answering questions. The listening party itself keeps you on your toes. I usually have a few tweets lined up beforehand \u2013 that way I can answer everyone\u2019s questions while it\u2019s live. It\u2019s hard to keep up. There\u2019s so many people out there saying things like \u201cwhere are we now?\u201d and I have to be on hand to say \u201ctwo minutes and 34 seconds into track four ... no, it\u2019s two minutes and 36 seconds now!\u201d It\u2019s growing every day. We could keep this going until Christmas. Sleaford Mods have just said they want to do all of their albums, every Thursday at 8pm. That\u2019s what I love about it, it\u2019s all about impulsive decisions and it spirals into a thing of its own. When I was first starting out, I would listen to Harvest by Neil Young to learn how to write songs. That was more of a conscious thing, but I\u2019m sure listening to all these classic albums will affect my songwriting in some subliminal way. Hopefully it will, and you won\u2019t ever get to hear that song I wrote about washing your hands.
