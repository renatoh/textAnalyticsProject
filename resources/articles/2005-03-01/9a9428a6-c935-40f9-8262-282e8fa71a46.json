Best known in the UK for his ownership of the Godolphin stables near Newmarket, Sheikh Mohammed's emirate state has recently opened the first stage of Dubailand, a middle eastern theme park which will be twice the size of Disneyland. Sameer Al Ansari, chief executive of state-owned Dubai International Capital (DIC), said the Tussauds' management team would be consulted on further developments at the site, though no decision had been taken on whether or not to introduce the waxwork galleries to the Arab emirate. The acquisition is also part of Sheikh Mohammed's programme to diversify state assets, and comes three months after a $1bn investment in US carmaker DaimlerChrysler. DIC plans to make 60% of future investments in North America and Europe, with the remainder in the Middle East and Asia. Tussauds Group attractions, which include Chessington World of Adventures, Madame Tussauds and Heide Park in north Germany, draw in 14 million visitors a year, making it Europe's largest theme park group. It also owns a third share in the London Eye Ferris wheel. Under Charterhouse ownership, management has expanded the Madame Tussauds brand overseas, opening branches in Las Vegas, New York and Hong Kong. It has focused on keeping collections up to date with fast-moving celebrity trends, ditching some historical figures in favour of pop stars Kylie Minogue and Justin Hawkins of The Darkness. In 2003 it unveiled an updated waxwork of Britney Spears complete with a chest heaving in time to her music. Private equity group Charterhouse had been in discussions with two potential financial buyers in 2003, but they were unable to agree a price for the business acquired from Pearson six years ago for \u00a3352m. Plans to float Tussauds also came to nothing. Tussauds chief executive Peter Phillipson claimed reports that Charterhouse had two years ago been seeking a price tag of \u00a3900m were exaggerated. Under Charterhouse's ownership, some 70 Tussauds executives shared a stake in the business valued on the DIC deal at \u00a330m. Mr Phillipson, who will continue to run the business, declined to say whether the stake had been raised or sold down. However, three senior executives, including Mr Phillipson, have pledged to invest half of their earnings back into an equity stake. Charterhouse refused to indicate how much it had realised from the Tussauds deal. \u00b7 Prudential, the insurer, is to sell half of its 35% stake in the Kent shopping mall Bluewater to the Singapore government for \u00a3318m. The two firms will form a joint venture company which will have the right to increase its share in Bluewater to 50% under certain circumstances."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
