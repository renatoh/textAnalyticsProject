The company has been hit by delays to works on the HS2 railway\u2019s southern section, the M6 smart motorway project, and a road in Preston. The Welsh government also cancelled the \u00a31.4bn works on the M4 near Newport amid opposition to a plan which would have damaged wildlife habitat in the Gwent Levels. The share price fall wiped more than \u00a3120m from the company\u2019s market value by mid-morning on Friday, after it published its trading update. The company told its AGM in May that it was trading in line with expectations, but it now expects revenues and profits for 2019 to be lower than previous guidance. It said underlying operating profit for the year would be between \u00a338m and \u00a342m, down from the previous guidance of \u00a356m. The company also took a \u00a39.8m hit after it was found liable for fixing a roof repaired by a subcontractor that later went into administration. Analysts at Liberum said they expected revenues for the year to fall by almost a quarter. The sharp fall presents a major challenge to new chief executive, Alex Vaughan, who was only promoted in May. He will face investors on Tuesday to present his new strategy. Vaughan said: \u201cDespite delays to the timing of certain contract start dates and new awards, our markets are strong, as evidenced by the breadth of our new contract awards in the first half.\u201d The company said its order book stood at \u00a34.2bn, up from \u00a33.7bn at the same point last year, with contracts to upgrade the A19 road on Tyneside and to provide maintenance to the water company United Utilities. \u201cWe have a strong balance sheet, profitable operations and a broad range of capabilities to support the growth of the business,\u201d Vaughan said. \u201cCostain is well placed to secure the opportunities ahead of us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
