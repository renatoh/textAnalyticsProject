Britain\u2019s best-known fund manager this week dramatically blocked investors from pulling their cash from the Woodford Equity Income Fund, which was launched in a blaze of publicity five years ago. So, if you have got money in it, you can\u2019t get it out for at least 28 days. What\u2019s happened? On Monday, Woodford suspended all trading in the fund \u201cuntil further notice\u201d after being overwhelmed by customer withdrawals following a series of bad market bets. Woodford\u2019s company said the move was designed to \u201cprotect\u201d investors and give him time to sell off assets. What now? Woodford said the fund would reopen \u201cas soon as is practicable after these exceptional circumstances have ceased\u201d. The suspension will be reviewed \u201cat least every 28 days\u201d. Investors won\u2019t be able to access their investments until the suspension is lifted. Woodford will probably need to build up a big pot of cash ready to meet redemptions when the fund reopens \u2013 easily several hundred million pounds, experts think. What will happen to my money? Existing investors will continue to own units in the fund, and they are being reassured that their money is safe. But there\u2019s no certainty at all about what it will be worth. When the fund reopens, its value will depend on the share prices of the fund\u2019s underlying companies. So if the share prices of those companies have risen, your investment will be worth more than it is today. But if the value has fallen, then so will your investment. But I need my cash right now! \u201cNo exceptions are envisaged at this stage,\u201d the company says. But if you are facing a real crisis, it\u2019s worth giving the firm a try to see if they might budge for you. I pay into the fund every month via direct debit \u2013 what happens now? Investors who have a direct debit are free to cancel it. Otherwise, most will have their money collected as usual and held in cash. You may want to check with the platform you use, or your IFA. Might I have money in the fund but not know it? Some investors may be unaware that they have exposure to the Woodford fund. For example, six of Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s Multi-Manager funds are invested in it. One of the six is the \u00a33bn Multi-Manager Income &amp; Growth fund. As of the end of April, about 13% of this fund was invested in Woodford\u2019s fund. Others may have exposure via their self-invested personal pension \u201cwrapper\u201d. You might want to check what your money is invested in. Will I still be charged a fee? The fund may be suspended, but it\u2019s still being actively managed. However, on Thursday, Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, asked Woodford to waive the fund\u2019s fees while it was suspended. Hargreaves Lansdown will waive its platform fee for the time being. Should I take my money out as soon as the fund reopens? Will there be a run on the fund? These are \u201cbig, big\u201d questions, says Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at investment firm Willis Owen. Clearly there are likely to be people queueing to get their money out when the fund reopens, putting more pressure on Woodford. But, says Lowcock, at the moment \u201cit\u2019s a bit like a 24-hour Twitter storm\u201d, with emotions running high and a lot of criticism flying about. Woodford will now be restructuring the fund\u2019s portfolio, and we need to wait and see how things look once he has done that, he adds. Investors almost need to look beyond all this and ask themselves whether Woodford \u201cis the manager for you\u201d. Lowcock says: \u201cIf the answer is no, you need to sell at some point. If he isn\u2019t for you, he shouldn\u2019t be in your portfolio.\u201d When the fund reopens, if a lot of money flows out, this could clearly have an impact on the share prices of the fund\u2019s underlying companies. So, all in all, pulling your money out on day one might not necessarily be the best call \u2013 but who knows? Any thoughts as to alternative income funds? Willis Owen has suggested these three: Man GLG UK Income, Threadneedle UK Equity Income, and Troy Asset Management\u2019s Trojan Income. How many investors are affected by all this? That has not been disclosed, but it\u2019s almost certainly several hundred thousand people. What if things go really badly wrong? There\u2019s no reason to think this will happen, but ultimately, if you have an investment with a firm that has failed, you might be eligible to claim from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which provides cover of up to \u00a385,000 per person per firm. But you would need to show, for example, that you were badly advised \u2013 the FSCS says: \u201cWe do not cover poor investment performance.\u201d Who do I complain to? Woodford Investment Management in the first instance. If you are unhappy with its response, you can go to the Financial Ombudsman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
