The South African is the defending champion and is attempting to become the first to retain the title since Tom Watson at Royal Birkdale in 1983. He is not the bookmaker's favourite; the almost inevitable Tiger Woods is the 11-4 choice with Labrokes, the 26th consecutive major championship he has started as the man perceived the most likely. Els is quoted at 7-1, a staggering difference in price considering what the man has done in the 12 months since his victory at Muirfield. Els has been imperious, winning the first two events on the US Tour in a total of 47 under par. He has won seven times in total and this year alone he has played 68 rounds of golf in a staggering 179 under par. That represents, in 26 weeks, more birdies than the average golfer manages in a lifetime. Moreover he won the Scottish Open last week by the simple expedient of turning in a 64 in the first round and saying to the rest of the field: \"Come and get me.\" No one got near and he won by five shots. Els is an amiable man whose relaxed demeanour has led to a tag he dislikes, the Big Easy. But it could just as properly refer to his physique and the way he plays, for he is a big man whose rhythm makes good men green. He sends the ball vast distances and when Jack Nicklaus first saw him he was amazed not so much by the power but by the effortlessness of it. It was that control which helped him when the gales arrived in the third round at Muirfield last year, blowing Woods to an 81. Els had a 72, a huge factor in his eventual win. So can he do it again? Since Watson some good men have tried and failed, including Severiano Ballesteros, Greg Norman, Nick Faldo and, of course, Woods. The last named could well be the determining factor as to whether Els succeeds. Like the South African, Woods has been playing some marvellous golf, winning four times in America, albeit none of them a major. The fact that he no longer holds one of the four majors has been extrapolated in some quarters into a slump, a ludicrous concept. The fact that after only seven years as a professional Woods has eight majors is a tribute to his phenomenal ability, not a comment on how easy it is to win championships. Even Woods needs to play well to win a championship and in the US Masters and the US Open his driving deserted him. He will not be using a driver much this week if the weather remains as it has been during the preliminaries. The course is hard and bouncy, the ball will run and run, and for both Woods and Els there will be lots of long irons off the tees. Woods has called the course \"flukey\" and Els has said he would like to see an aerial photograph of the place \"because it must look awesome, full of mounds and lumps and stuff\". The South African thinks that hitting the 17th and 18th greens could be close to impossible, because of the mounds and \"stuff\", but Peter Dawson, secretary of the Royal &amp; Ancient, disagreed. \"Good players,\" he said, \"who play this course regularly say that as soon as you've hit the ball you know which way its going to bounce because the bounces are predictable if you know the course well enough.\" That knowledge might be difficult to acquire in the three days of championship preparation, but Dawson also said: \"This week will be all about positioning the ball off the tee, so that you can get at the flag with your second. We are looking to reward good second shots which follow drives into the right place.\" Few 80-1 shots win majors, particularly when they are 40 years old, but that does not stop Colin Montgomerie from thinking, wholly illogically, that this could be his year. The best he has done in 13 Opens is a tie for eighth nine years ago but despite that he said yesterday: \"I still feel within my own self that I'm one of the favourites.\" Montgomerie thinks that the old guard might do better this week than the young bloods because of the need for extreme patience. But none of the fresh crop of challengers - Luke Donald, Paul Casey, Justin Rose or Ian Poulter - is exactly hot-headed, or at least not on the golf course. Donald is going to have to put up with the shenanigans that go with playing with Woods, but his Walker Cup captain Peter McEvoy believes he will not even notice all the fuss around him. Padraig Harrington and Darren Clarke will expect, and are expected, to do well. Both are capable, on sheer talent, of winning a major and it is possible that one of them could be holding the claret jug come Sunday night. Harrington will need to find his positive thinking cap and Clarke his putting stroke but, at eighth and 17th in the world rankings respectively they are rather higher than when the last European to win the Open did so. Paul Lawrie was 159th in 1999 at Carnoustie. But it is unlikely that anyone will be good enough to beat Els or Woods this week, and Els is good enough to win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
