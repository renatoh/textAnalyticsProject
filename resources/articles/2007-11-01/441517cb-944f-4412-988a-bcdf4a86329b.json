British Land spooked the City last month when it failed to sell a stake in the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield because of the credit crunch. Analysts fear that capital values of all commercial property could fall by up to 20 per cent. Expect writedowns to become a feature of the reporting season. The sector has enjoyed phenomenal growth in recent years, but now the chickens are coming home to roost. Roll out the barrel Looking for a home for your money? Search no further than BG, the oil and gas group. The company has long been a takeover target for the majors such as BP or Shell, but that's not the reason to buy. News from Brazil suggests that a project where the company holds a 25 per cent stake has hit the jackpot with estimated reserves of around 8 billion barrels of oil, much more than forecasts. BG, headed by Frank Chapman, pictured, is a junior partner in the offshore Tupi field with Brazil's Petrobras, but the rewards could be considerable, according to analysts at CSFB - who have raised their price target to 1100p. Caribbean hang-up Cable &amp; Wireless, the telecommunications group, is feverishly working on a plan to split itself in two next year. But a plot to sell the group's Caribbean operations to private equity group Carlyle is the latest victim of the credit squeeze. The banks are refusing to lend money for buyouts. Investors won't be pleased. Is Babcock on track? Babcock International, the defence group that runs naval dockyards, is a prime beneficiary of the government's go-ahead for plans to build new Royal Navy aircraft carriers. But will that be enough to offset delays in its rail contracting business from affecting profits? All will be revealed when the group publishes its half-time numbers this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
