Yet the Americans are right to highlight some concerns, given the way England strolled past Norway last Thursday and could even afford the luxury of Nikita Parris missing a penalty with the score at 3-0. By contrast, USA expended a fair deal more energy \u2013 not just because of the weather \u2013 in getting past France a day later. For Alyssa Naeher, the US goalkeeper, concerns are understandably centred on White, the tournament\u2019s joint-top scorer. Their game three months ago against England in the SheBelieves Cup will provide a valuable blueprint. The teams drew 2-2 but England won the competition. Naeher said: \u201cEllen White is in great form and scoring goals and we\u2019ll move on to shift our focus and figure out a gameplan to stop that. We played them back in March so we\u2019ll go back and look at that and we\u2019ve watched a few of their games throughout this tournament. It\u2019s going to be another hard-fought game.\u201d Alex Morgan, one of those tied with White in the scorers\u2019 chart on five goals, believes the danger does not stop with England\u2019s in-form striker. \u201cEllen White is obviously coming into this next game really confident,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has gained that starting spot and that\u2019s huge. We have to look at her because of the goals she is scoring. We also know we have to look at the wingers and the speed that they have, and the 10 spot, looking at [Fran] Kirby. They have a lot of talent on the team.\u201d Morgan will be trying to break down the meanest defence left in the tournament \u2013 \u201cstingy\u201d is how Becky Sauerbrunn describes it \u2013 but the she knows England are on the up. \u201cThey obviously dominated against Norway, it was a great game for them so we were watching pretty closely knowing that we could very well face them. Now it\u2019s all about recovering for them. They\u2019ve really evolved their game over the last couple of years and we\u2019ve been fortunate enough to play them every single year [at the SheBelieves Cup], so I think we\u2019ll see something that we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of, but now it\u2019s who is going to show up to play.\u201d Morgan, though, despite a tough schedule, \u201cfeels good\u201d. \u201cPlaying this many 90-minute matches and playing in the last group, meaning we had the least amount of rest, is not ideal. But we feel great and we will be ready,\u201d she said. The USA defender Abby Dahlkemper agrees that Neville\u2019s side have a number of strong features to their play. \u201cEngland are a really good side,\u201d she said. \u201cThey play well and it will be a good match-up. They\u2019re athletic and tactically flexible. Their wingers are very pacy and they like to attack from their full-backs as well. We have to be aware of that and the threat. We have to be good in transition on Tuesday.\u201d The midfielder Sam Mewis didn\u2019t mention Lucy Bronze, scorer of that brilliant strike against Norway, by name but she knows which side the Lionesses prefer to attack down. She said: \u201cEngland are dangerous down that right flank but they have a lot of threats. We are going to take everything into consideration and of course we will continue to try to play our game.\u201d On facing another top three team within five days Dahlkemper is unfazed: \u201cI think pressure makes us step up even more. We\u2019re prideful. We have this winning mentality \u2013 whatever it takes. We definitely showed that and put in a gritty performance because that was what it was going to take to win.\u201d The trouble they have is trying to predict Phil Neville\u2019s side. With 22 of the 23 in the squad having playedappeare, and the team employing both 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 formations, deciding on how best to cope with their threats is a tough task. But with England posing so many problems, what can the US offer in return? Many things, of course, but like Neville\u2019s team, the Americans have like to ensure their gameplan is fluid and unpredictable. The move to a back five after an hour against France in their 2-1 win surprised many and they have used every outfield player at some stage so far. \u201cWe want to be a hard team to scout,\u201d explained Sauerbrunn. \u201cWe have a variety of formations and ways of playing. We want to make it hard for teams to prep for us.\u201d Mewis added: \u201cWe can do better. France posed us a lot of challenges and had a lot of the ball. I give us credit for grinding it out and getting the win but we know we have more to offer and want to show that in the next game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
