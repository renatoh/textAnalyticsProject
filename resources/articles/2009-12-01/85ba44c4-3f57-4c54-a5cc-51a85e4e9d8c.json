It was not pretty. There were times when they had to defend like dogs. But the faithful in the Shed were not too bothered about that. For 10 minutes it looked as if we were in for a treat. Gloucester piled on the pressure and finally swept the ball out to the right, where Charlie Sharples could score virtually unopposed. It would never be so simple again. Gloucester were fortunate to end the first half in front by 10-6. Thereafter, Newcastle had the territory and the opportunities. Their best chance was when Jimmy Gopperth made a dazzling break but chose to ignore his supporting runners and was brought to ground five metres from the line. All of which escaped the notice of Akapusi Qera and Jon Golding, who seemed intent on beating the living daylights out of one another while Gopperth was making his run. A peace of sorts was finally restored. For all their pressure, Newcastle could muster only two penalties in that half as the game became tighter and scrappier. The scrums were a mess. To retain their lead Gloucester had to defend defiantly when pinioned to their own line just before the interval. Yet in the second half the Newcastle challenge fell away. Gloucester did not do too much to extend their lead as the drizzle glistened in the floodlights. Having infiltrated Newcastle territory, they were the recipients of penalties. Four times Nick Robinson's trusty left boot did the trick and he also slotted a drop goal for a tally of 20 points. By now, conditions did not suit catch-up rugby. Gloucester were comfortable despite a late try from Alex Tait \u2013 all except Qera, who had been poleaxed trying to tackle Filipo Levi. It took almost 15 minutes to take the poor man off on a stretcher.
