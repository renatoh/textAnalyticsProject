For the 1975 adaptation of Raymond Chandler\u2019s Farewell, My Lovely, which brought her second Oscar nod, she still failed to clock up more than 10 minutes on screen. But then Miles, who has died aged 94, knew how to make every second count, filling her life as well as her performances with incident and vitality. Midnight Cowboy demonstrated her extraordinary way with character, conveying the depth of a complex life in a handful of concentrated gestures. Briskly applying her lipstick in the mirror, she is oblivious to the awkward attempts by the greenhorn hustler Joe (Jon Voight) to broach the subject of payment after sex. When the penny drops, it is with the force of an H-bomb. \u201cYou were gonna ask me for money?\u201d she croaks. \u201cWho the hell do you think you\u2019re dealing with? Some old slut on 42nd Street?\u201d She declares herself \u201cone hell of a gorgeous chick\u201d before diving, sobbing, in the direction of the nearest box of tissues. \u201cI become the character at the time I\u2019m doing it, so it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s two minutes or 200 hours,\u201d Miles later explained. Bob Dylan had been commissioned to write the film\u2019s theme song but failed to deliver it in time; nevertheless it was always Miles\u2019s contention that the eventual result, Lay Lady Lay, was inspired by her. She was no less memorable in Farewell, My Lovely as a boozy ex-showgirl briefly revived by the knowledge of her own usefulness, however fleeting, to the private detective Philip Marlowe (Robert Mitchum). In between those two films she had the rare chance to play a lead, and responded with some of her fiercest work: Heat (1972), produced by Andy Warhol and directed by Paul Morrissey, was a loose update of Sunset Boulevard in which she took the Gloria Swanson role of the faded star. Dazed non-professionals were Warhol and Morrissey\u2019s preferred collaborators and the presence for the first time in one of their movies of a skilled and vivid performer with her own baggage gave the film an extra kick. Miles brought the same degree of commitment to everything that came her way, be it a part or a party, and the suggestion that she might not be welcome at the latest shindig was far likelier to provoke her ire than a mere bad notice. After the critic John Simon referred to her in print in 1973 as \u201cone of New York\u2019s leading party girls and gate-crashers\u201d, she dumped her dinner on his head in a restaurant. Most reports claimed it was a plate of pat\u00e9, steak tartare, brie and potato salad; Miles added coleslaw and cold cuts in her own re-telling, which ended with her advising Simon: \u201cNow you can call me a plate-crasher, too!\u201d Decades later she was still smarting from the slight. \u201cHow could I crash anything? I was invited to everything!\u201d She was born in New York to Bella (nee Feldman) and her husband Reuben Scheinwald, a furniture-maker and factory owner . As a child she played chess with her father in Washington Square Park, and continued to do so competitively. She was educated at Washington Irving high school and Pratt Institute, and also attended the Actors Studio. She appeared in countless off-Broadway shows in her career, beginning in 1954 with A Stone for Danny Fisher, starring Zero Mostel. In 1957, a year into its run, she joined the cast of The Iceman Cometh, starring Jason Robards, in the production generally credited with fortifying that play\u2019s reputation. She was also in the US premiere of Jean Genet\u2019s The Balcony in 1960, for which her dresser was said to be Barbra Streisand. In 1981 she mounted a poorly received one-woman show, It\u2019s Me, Sylvia!, derived from articles she had written for the SoHo Weekly News and performed on a set modelled on her own notoriously cluttered apartment. Her career in the 1960s was dominated by theatre and television before Midnight Cowboy led film-makers to notice her. She was briefly seen in Dennis Hopper\u2019s The Last Movie (1971) and starred with Peter Fonda in the thriller 92 in the Shade (1975). In Michael Winner\u2019s tasteless horror The Sentinel (1977), she was a German zombie lesbian ballet dancer. She remained in that genre to play a fortune teller in The Funhouse (1981), then starred as James Mason\u2019s wife in the Agatha Christie adaptation Evil Under the Sun (1982). In Wall Street (1987), she was a brassy real estate agent, decked out in leopard print with sunglasses wedged in her platinum hair; she returned briefly in the 2010 sequel Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Her boisterous turn as the chicken-chomping, lip-smacking matchmaker in Crossing Delancey (1988) was among her funniest work. She was reunited with Morrissey on Spike of Bensonhurst (1988), in which he cast her as a coke-snorting politician. In Abel Ferrara\u2019s Go Go Tales (2007), starring Willem Dafoe and Bob Hoskins, she was a landlady who considers turning a pole-dancing club into a branch of Bed Bath and Beyond. \u201cI\u2019m always thought of as controversial or avant garde or erotic or salacious,\u201d she once reflected. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t anybody I know who wouldn\u2019t live my life if they could.\u201d Her days were spent \u201cgoing out, working, getting laid,\u201d and she flitted from one companion to the next with aplomb and enthusiasm. She was married three times by the age of 40; each marriage ended in divorce. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with younger men?\u201d she asked when questioned about the disparity in age between her and most of her partners. \u201cThey have less problems, less bitterness and more stamina.\u201d She carried her own press clippings with her wherever she went, and lived the life of \u201can elegant mole\u201d in a museum-like New York City apartment filled with so many cherished mementoes \u2013 photographs, dolls and other knick-knacks and artefacts \u2013 that she rarely received guests for fear they might dislodge some cherished keepsake from its place. \u201cPeople disappoint you. Lovers disappoint you. But theatrical memorabilia stays with you, as long as you keep it under clear plastic,\u201d she said. She is survived by a sister, Thelma. \u2022 Sylvia Miles, actor, born 9 September 1924; died 12 June 2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
