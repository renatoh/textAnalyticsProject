With the launch yesterday of Gordon Brown's formal leadership bid and Tony Blair's endorsement, Labour's handover of power has begun. It is all but a procession, and will be unless the two potential challengers, Michael Meacher and John McDonnell, can agree before nominations close next Thursday who is to carry the left's banner. At least they sound confident that they can muster enough nominations to force a contest and ensure the debate on the party's direction that could help to revitalise its fortunes. The new leader will be announced at a special party conference on June 24, ready to take over when Mr Blair tenders his resignation to the Queen on June 27. Mr Brown has a lot to do. Yesterday he made a start on his metamorphosis from chancellor to prime minister - a transformation that has to take place not just in public, but in the public mind. These weeks are his chrysalis stage, when he must convey an appetite for change without denying his own role in the present state of affairs; distance himself from his predecessor without pouring salt in the as-yet-unhealed wound that is the Blair/Brown tribal divide; reinvent his political personality (goodbye, Grumpy Gordon) and present himself as an open, empathetic character with an appetite for public debate. And at the same time he, a Scot with a Scottish constituency, must start to shore up Labour's crumbling electoral support in England's south-east. But Mr Brown has always been a strategist to the nail-bitten tips of his fingers, so it was no surprise that his campaign launch ticked all the boxes as tidily as a company secretary's annual report. It was far less smooth in media terms, but maybe that was part of the plan too. This is a moment that has been a long, long time coming. Thirteen years since he made way for Mr Blair as leader; 10 years as chancellor, the last 18 months of which he has spent, with foot-tapping impatience, in the Treasury departure lounge. After all that time, the campaign launch was an unstoppable flow of ideas at the start of what Mr Brown promised would be weeks devoted to listening to the anxieties and ambitions of the citizens of Britain. There were no instant solutions, only the encompassing theme of devolving power and trusting people. Even in Iraq, he seemed to suggest, it might provide a route away from civil war. He paid tribute to the morality and integrity of his parents, and declared education his passion and the health service his immediate focus: so far all appropriate, and predictable. The most worked-out thoughts were about the way Britain is governed, a fruitful strand for the successor to a prime minister who, through a dangerous mix of impatience and lack of interest, has notably failed at administration. Mr Brown made some bold promises about increasing openness and government accountability to parliament. His idea of formalising the unofficial confirmation hearings for major public appointments, already adopted by many of the MPs' departmental select committees, is welcome. His proposal for a draft Queen's speech promises a more consultative approach than any government has tried before. His talk of a government of all the talents is at least a useful counter to the charge that at the Treasury he has excluded all but a tiny, hand-picked group of individuals. Perhaps he might even soon come to accept the need for a civil service bill to protect Whitehall's independence. This was Mr Brown's moment to change the music, to set a new theme, for himself and the party. He could not resist a poke at celebrity politics, but he spoke convincingly of his desire to serve in a \"humble government\" - a new thought in the Labour lexicon. This was partly an early experiment in the language of marrying change and continuity. But it was also a beginner's attempt, by a notoriously private man, at becoming a salesman not just of ideas but of himself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
