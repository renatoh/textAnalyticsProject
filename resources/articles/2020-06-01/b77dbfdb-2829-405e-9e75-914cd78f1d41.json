FTSE 100 companies are forecast to pay out \u00a39.5bn less in dividends to shareholders for the 2019 trading year, according to investing platform AJ Bell, as the coronavirus crisis ravages their income. That\u2019s 11% less money going to shareholders\u2019 pockets compared with the previous year. Some 48 FTSE 100 firms have announced some kind of reduction to, or suspension of, payments to shareholders, compared with 47 that have kept or increased them since the start of the year, AJ Bell says. Worse is expected, with National Grid\u2019s delayed annual results statement on Thursday the latest date circled in red pen on the calendars of nervous investors. Before the crisis, National Grid, the owner of the UK\u2019s high-voltage electricity network, was trundling along, as utilities are wont to do (apart from British Gas owner Centrica). Profits of \u00a32.47bn are expected for the year to 31 March, but that only includes eight days of the UK\u2019s lockdown. Beyond that, any detail on what to expect has essentially been limited to the investor equivalent of \u201chere be dragons\u201d. Financial performance was in line with previous guidance, according to the company\u2019s last update in early April, with the glaring caveat that this was \u201cbefore any Covid-19 impacts\u201d. That leaves a lot of room for manoeuvre, and falling energy use during the crisis suggests National Grid\u2019s customers, electricity generators, will have less to spend. Given what is going on in health systems around the rest of the world, there are not violins small enough to mourn the losses of shareholders who miss out on a chunky cheque while they sit at home. But the dividend freeze taking over the FTSE 100 has broader implications. Simply put, what is bad news for infrastructure providers such as National Grid is also bad news for those who rely on their technology \u2013 which in the case of the electricity grid includes everyone in Britain save the odd apocalypse prepper. One would hope that it would cut short-term returns to shareholders before its \u00a35bn annual investment needs are hit; but any historian of capitalism this side of the millennium would urge you not to take that for granted. National Grid is one the companies most central to the UK\u2019s net-zero ambitions. The UK\u2019s energy network is changing shape, with coal and nuclear stations closing and vast wind and solar generation coming online. At the same time, the advent of battery electric vehicles \u2013 which could be the only option for car buyers by 2035 or earlier \u2013 means demands for electricity will be far greater. A major irony of this squeeze is that the pandemic has given a glimpse \u2013 albeit at an intolerably high cost \u2013 of another world: one with less traffic, cleaner air, and radically lower carbon emissions. The concurrence of drastically lower energy usage and the sunniest and driest British spring since at least 1929 means the UK was, at the time of going to print, still setting a new record for the UK\u2019s longest period of coal-free electricity generation since 1882, when a power station in Holborn, London, first fired up. Yet the ominous signs for the future are already there. \u201cWe are starting to see some delays and disruption to our capital programme,\u201d National Grid said in its April update. If the investment freeze caused by the pandemic worsens, it won\u2019t just be shareholders who pay the price."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
