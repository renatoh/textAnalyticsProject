The money will come only if there is firm evidence of improved performance. And where will he get that evidence? Through a regime of audits and inspections, naturally, to be carried out by two new 'super-regulators': the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection, and another for Social Care. Audit and regulation may be the fastest growing profession in the UK today. When researchers at the London School of Economics investigated in 1997, they found that unlike other areas of the public sector, the regulatory apparatus of the state was booming. It consisted of 150 regulators, ombudsmen, inspectorates, auditors and watchdogs employing around 20,000 people and costing around \u00a31 billion to run directly. That, of course, did not include the stupendous costs that such bodies impose on their auditees. For example, an Ofsted inspection costs a school around \u00a320,000, while some parish councils find themselves spending half their meagre budgets on an audit to show that their money (the other half, that is) has been well spent. Work that one out. Under Labour, the 'audit explosion', as LSE's Professor Michael Power has christened it, has by no means slackened. Power says Labour has extended its purview from cost control to broader evaluation of almost any kind of performance. The Economist magazine totted up a total of 600 targets that the public sector is now subject to, from hospital waiting times to literacy to crime clear-up rates - all for which figures have to be collected internally, to be monitored and audited externally. This regulatory state is now so sprawling and costly, stretching into every aspect of our lives, that it badly needs an audit itself. What do all those numbers add up to? The underlying point of audit and regulation is reassurance: that public money is in safe hands, that minimum standards are respected, that people are carrying out their jobs. In Power's memorable phrase, it is a 'comfort production industry'. Unfortunately, as the philosopher Onora O'Neill has been pointing out in this year's Reith Lectures, it doesn't seem to be a very effective one. Why, ponders O'Neill, do we hear so much about a 'crisis of trust'? There is little evidence that people or institutions are more untrustworthy than they used to be. And there is a torrent of information and ever more transparency about what they are up to. Could it be that, far from building trust, the methods of accountability being applied - especially in the public sector - are actually making things worse? She believes the answer is yes. The accountability revolution, she argues, has not achieved its aim of rebuilding confidence because, instead of supporting the purposes of the public services it obstructs and distorts them. If there's a crisis of policing it's because coppers are too busy filling in forms to finger collars. Young teachers are leaving the profession in droves because they want a life outside the classroom. Even children are affected: the more time they spend being audited (examined), the less they have for learning. Complaint procedures, O'Neill adds, are now so burdensome that 'avoiding complaints... becomes a central institutional goal in its own right. We are heading towards defensive medicine, defensive teaching and defensive policing.' The new accountability sits ill with professional ethics. Removing discretion, the combination of detailed and prescriptive managerial targets and bureaucratic processes has killed the civic component in many public-sector jobs. Some of the targets are incoherent or incompatible with mandated processes (for example universities required to admit 50 per cent of school leavers without lowering standards). This breeds cynicism among professionals and suspicion among the public, who see teachers and doctors responding not to the needs of pupils or patients but to those of auditors, regulators or funders. There are more insidious worries. The accountability requirements, ostensibly to the public, are in reality to government departments or agencies - in other words, to the state. And the areas of central control are growing. For one thing, audit tends to marginalise and displace other forms of monitoring; for another, the response to every regulatory failure is to add yet more rules, standards and monitoring bodies - so the ratio of 'observers' to 'doers' constantly grows. The result is an inexorable regulatory creep. Take the Audit Commission, which has gradually broadened its role from financial audit of local government and other services to setting performance indicators, qualifying processes and even expressing a view on the quality of management. This is a remarkable notion, given the lack of 'evidence' (to use a very regulatory term) of what constitutes good management even in the private sector, let alone if and how it can be generalised into schools, hospitals and the police. The danger is that management systems for such services are designed for central audit, not for service. As O'Neill puts it: 'Central planning may have failed in the former Soviet Union, but it is alive and well in Britain today.' Checks and balances are necessary, but it should be clear by now that regulation doesn't solve the problem of trust; it just displaces it. Unfortunately, the watchdogs and the techniques they use, aren't any more trustworthy than the entities they are guarding. So what's a better way? We do know from other areas of management that designing quality into a product or process from the start is far more effective, as well as far cheaper, than inspecting it at the end. A regime of 'intelligent accountability' would encourage the public services to spend far more time and attention on the front end - on system design and work organisation, on recruiting and training the right people, on values and on governance - and reward high performers with much lighter external controls. Regulation doesn't deliver trust, so make people earn and give it in direct interchange. 'If we want a culture of public service,' says O'Neill, 'professionals and public servants must in the end be free to serve the public rather than their paymasters.' simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
