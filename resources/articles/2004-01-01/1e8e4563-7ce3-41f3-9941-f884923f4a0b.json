No sooner had Claudio Ranieri's team rediscovered their flow with victories over Leicester City and Watford than things came to a shuddering halt. Given the chance to move to within two points of Manchester United they failed to find a way past a defiant, tireless Birmingham City. No wonder Roman Abramovich looked so glum. If the Chelsea owner thought the players had rediscovered their swagger after a fallow period, he was mistaken. This was a below-par display, lacking the spark for the most part to break down opponents who made life difficult with their organisation and hard work. Ranieri's team dominated and had much the better chances, but will not reflect on this with pleasure. It was hard to enthuse about their performance even if they hit a post through Joe Cole, forced two good saves from Maik Taylor and wasted three other opportunities. Twice in the last five minutes they might have snatched victory but they ended with a second straight Premiership blank here after losing to Liverpool. \"Frustrating,\" Ranieri said. \"We tried to do everything.\" The manager declared himself \"pleased\" with the performance and insisted his team's \"bad period\" was over. \"I'm very confident now,\" he said, but few home fans will share that. The sooner Damien Duff gets back to his best the better for Chelsea. The Irishman came on at half-time but made little impact and his speed, skill and unpredictability are needed. As it was, Chelsea were often easier to read than they needed to be. They played the final half-hour with Adrian Mutu operating behind Eidur Gudjohnsen and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink but too much was funnelled through the centre without producing anything until Mutu set up those late chances. Eye-witnesses claimed Mutu and Birmingham's Darren Purse were involved in a heated, physical exchange in the tunnel afterwards, and the Football Association will await the referee Jeff Winter's report with interest. Mutu is said to have been bundled into the dressing room by his team-mates. He and Purse had been arguing when the final whistle went. Honest fight had been part of Birmingham's game throughout. They closed down quickly and smothered attacks. Robbie Savage and Stephen Clemence may never have gained mastery of the midfield but their work-rate made life unpleasant. Birmingham made only one notable chance, wasted by Savage, but there was much to admire in their refusal to buckle. Taylor generally impressed with his handling, and was rescued by a fine clearance by Olivier Tebily when he made an error. Kenny Cunningham was his solid self and Jeff Kenna did well at left-back. There was little decent service from Chelsea's flanks throughout, with Jesper Gronkjkaer withdrawn and Cole not the sort to swing over a succession of crosses. Hasselbaink had headed wide from 12 yards from Wayne Bridge's centre before Cole hit a post with a curling shot after cutting inside Tebily. Later Cole's high ball into the box culminated in Tebily's clearance to deny William Gallas after Marcel Desailly had beaten Taylor to the ball. The on-loan goalkeeper later impressed by saving from Frank Lampard and, crucially, with a leg, from Hasselbaink - there is a deal in place to buy Taylor from Fulham if Blues stay up. Near the finish Gudjohnsen might have won this for Chelsea but his effort went wide, summing up a disappointing afternoon for his side.
