But Phil Mickelson does not entirely see it that way. Big things were expected of the 43-year-old at this US PGA Championship, partly on account of his stunning Open victory at Muirfield last month. After this final major of the season, however, the left-hander will be doing his best to forget failing to match up to its stern test. Mickelson was on a plane bound for home in San Diego by the time the Wanamaker Trophy was being competed for down the East Course's final stretch. A final round of 72 left Mickelson on an aggregate of 12-over par, albeit a fourth-round back nine of 33 illustrating that he was not of a mind to give up entirely. \"I didn't play very well over the last two weeks,\" Mickelson admitted. \"I'm not going to worry about it. I'm going to go home and take a few weeks off, get my short game sharp and start back up in four or five days for the FedEx Cup playoff series. I'm not going to worry too much about it. \"I'm going to go just work on my short game at my home, just chip and putt, and then wait four or five days before I start hitting balls again because I want to just kind of forget these couple of weeks, where I really haven't struck it the way I had for a few months. \"I don't feel like it's that far off. I struggled on the greens. I was over-reading almost every putt. I really struggled fading the ball but I drew the ball well off the tee. I hit some good tee shots; it felt easy. I hit some good iron shots where I drew it, but I had trouble getting the ball working to the left pins and consequently left myself a lot of long putts on those holes. \"I'll look at some film from those events I played well and just try to do the same thing that I was doing.\" Mickelson is already placed well inside the top 10 in that FedEx series, meaning he is all but guaranteed an appearance in the finale at East Lake in Atlanta during late September. The overall winner of that complicated playoff event claims $10m. The Californian refused to offer anything by way of negative comment towards the US PGA venue. The winning score at Oak Hill was well under par, but Mickelson was not the only big name to struggle on what is generally regarded as one of the toughest courses on the major circuit. \"It is a great place to host the tournament,\" Mickelson said. \"It's a wonderful golf course. I have kind of an emotional bond here at Oak Hill because of the fact I played my first Ryder Cup here [in 1995]. So I'll always have kind of a tie here, but I thought the community really hosted the tournament well, too.\" Matteo Manassero, who had featured on the leaderboard midway through round two, closed with a 77 to match Mickelson's 12-over total. Darren Clarke was four shots worse off after a dismal closing round of 80. There was cheer, though, for the South African Tim Clark as he recorded the first hole-in-one of the 95th US PGA Championship. The South African made it at the 220-yard 11th hole with a hybrid club. Ian Poulter signed off from Rochester with a 70 which included six pars, six birdies and six bogeys. \"Eighteen pars would be really boring,\" the Englishman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
