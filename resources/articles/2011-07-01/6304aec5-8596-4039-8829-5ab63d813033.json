Her most recent role was in EastEnders, playing the long-suffering Ronnie Mitchell, while her stage roles include the West End musical Guys and Dolls, opposite the late Patrick Swayze. She will soon appear as Nellie Forbush in South Pacific Are you enjoying rehearsing the role of Nellie? I'm totally smitten with her. She's an innocent from the deep south, on the surface, and yet there is so much more to her personality. She can be thoughtful and open, and kooky and funny, and also quite aggressive when she feels under attack. It's a much more complicated part than I bargained for, but I'm really enjoying it. Had you seen South Pacific before? I'd seen versions of it, but I hadn't seen this production. The problem with South Pacific, often, is that it's too beautiful, musically, and the grittier elements to do with racial tension and foreign occupation get lost. This one is different. It was the first Broadway production since 1949. The Rodgers and Hammerstein estates didn't allow it to be done until they knew Bartlett Sher was doing it, because they knew his work and trusted him. So I feel very lucky to be involved. You started out singing in the Eurovision Song Contest\u2026 Yeah, I try not to remember that, it's like 103 years ago. Somebody asked me if I wanted to do it and I never thought for a second that I was going to get into the final. I was very young and it was an insane experience: not something I'd want to replicate. But then I did Guinevere in Camelot at the Covent Garden festival, and Guys and Dolls, and an operatic version of Joan of Arc, so musicals have been dotted throughout my career. After a long stint on TV, are you now hoping to take more stage roles? No, I'm just trying to mix up the characters: the form in which they come is not important. Ronnie Mitchell in EastEnders was so withdrawn and secretive and dark, so Nellie \u2013 with her open quality and hick-style delivery \u2013 was a challenge I really wanted to take on. Were you glad to leave Ronnie behind? I wouldn't say I was glad. Ronnie had had her time, she couldn't go any further. She had so much trauma that it wouldn't have been believable to put her through any more, I feel. It's a very hard thing to do: you get very comfortable being in regular employment, and I'm a jobbing actor again, and that's quite scary. I feel grateful to have had the experience but I'm glad to be moving in another direction. You'll be touring with South Pacific until January. Is it difficult doing a long run with two young children? It's not easy. My husband's an actor as well, and there are weeks that are utterly impossible. I have to do the mummy thing this weekend and then try to come back fresh-faced for Monday. But my kids are great, and I love it. What are your plans after South Pacific? Eating. I've been exercising a lot \u2013 running and doing Bikram yoga and all the things I've been avoiding in the past 10 years \u2013 because wearing 1940s bikinis on stage is enough to terrify anyone into submission. So it'll be lovely to relax for a bit after we're done and catch my breath. South Pacific is at the Barbican, London from 12 August to 1 October, then touring nationwide"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
