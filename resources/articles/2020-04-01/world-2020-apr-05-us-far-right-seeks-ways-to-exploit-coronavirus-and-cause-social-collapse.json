The watchdog group the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) raised the alarm last week about opportunism from far-right so-called \u201caccelerationist\u201d groups who believe sowing chaos and violence will hasten the collapse of society, allowing them to build a white supremacist one in its place. Late last month, the FBI warned such extremist groups were encouraging members to deliberately spread the virus to Jewish people and police officers. Similarly, British hate monitors Hope Not Hate warned these groups are expressing \u201cgleeful expectation of social turmoil\u201d. With few public-facing social media services allowing white supremacists to have a reliable platform for their views, the propaganda effort to use the coronavirus crisis as a recruiting tool is mainly visible on laissez-faire social media platforms like Telegram. There neo-Nazi groups have been affirming and welcoming the pandemic as a threat to liberal democracy and seeing it as an opportunity to grow their movement and realize their goals with acts of violence. \u201cAll we\u2019ve been saying is this pandemic is real, it is global, and this will get pretty bad so prepare and enjoy the show,\u201d read one post to a coronavirus-themed neo-Nazi channel in recent days, between posts baselessly speculating that white people were less prone to contracting it and racist conspiracy theories about its origins. Beyond accepting the pandemic is real, activists are encouraging like-minded neo-Nazis to take advantage of the social chaos it creates in order to further destabilize the liberal democratic systems they despise. One channel issued an eight-point plan for \u201cthe boog\u201d \u2013 a term used on the far right to denote what they believe to be a looming civil war. Their advice included acts of terrorism and sabotage and asks people to \u201cencourage locals to join your cause, if have to do it by force\u201d, and \u201cattack key locations for federal entities, NATO outposts, and military presence\u201d. At the same time, such groups are using the pandemic to sharpen their condemnations of \u201cthe system\u201d, and encouraging people to lose all hope in normal political processes. A representative post in one channel made in recent days read, \u201cI have said it before and I will say it again, America is Dead.\u201d Such posturing \u2013 which often combines nihilism, exhortations to violence and conspiracy-addled racism \u2013 is shared by groups like the ostensibly disbanded Atomwaffen Division, The Base and Fueuerkrieg Division. This subculture, whose members openly advocate terrorism, has been subject to multiple arrests and prosecutions in recent months, on charges ranging from synagogue vandalism to conspiracy to murder. An SPLC researcher, Cassie Miller, said these groups have always talked about ways that western democracies might be destabilized, but \u201cthis time the political opportunity has come to them. They haven\u2019t had to do anything to sow chaos at this point. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018see, this is what we told you. Modern society is unsustainable. It is eventually headed towards collapse\u2019,\u201d Miller added. \u201cAnd they think that they\u2019re going to be the revolutionary vanguard that is going to be in place to handle the situation when it eventually breaks down.\u201d Similar sentiments appear to have motivated a Missouri man who planned a car bomb attack on a hospital which was treating coronavirus patients. He was shot dead by FBI agents who were seeking to arrest him late last month. The man, who had been under FBI investigation for months, was active in Telegram chats associated with two neo-Nazi groups: the longstanding National Socialist Movement and the accelerationist group Vorherrschaft Division. Miller said these groups remain potentially dangerous but a wave of recent arrests has weakened them, and it\u2019s not clear what capacity they have to carry out actions beyond attacks by radicalized individuals. \u201cI think that the FBI has clearly reprioritized white supremacist violence, and we\u2019ve seen the effects of that in the last several months,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s caused this huge disruption in these networks. And I hope that the attention continues, especially as people who are part of this movement are trying to exploit the current political atmosphere.\u201d The FBI declined to confirm or deny the existence of any active investigation into individuals or groups embracing neo-Nazi accelerationism. \u201cHowever, we continue steadfast in our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution throughout this period of national emergency,\u201d an FBI spokesperson wrote in an email. \u201cOur operations remain directed toward national security and violations of federal law, and will continue unabated\u201d, the spokesperson added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
