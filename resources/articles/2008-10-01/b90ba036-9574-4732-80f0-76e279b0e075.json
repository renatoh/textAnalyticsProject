If your idea of heaven is sitting squeezed on an uncomfortable bench having queued for hours to see some very skinny girls walk down a runway, then \u2026 well, you either work in fashion or you need therapy. However if you are considerably better adjusted and prefer to consume your fashion from the comfort of your sofa, then you'll be delighted to hear that Alexander McQueen \u2013 one of Paris fashion week's hot tickets - has put on an exclusive internet fashion show. That's exclusive as in, open to the entire web-connected world. Net-a-porter are showing his pre-spring 09 collection and if you get carried away (and who wouldn't?), you can order the clothes immediately. We've spotted a trend\u2026 Could fashion designers possibly be waking up to the web? Or just trying to save some cash in times of dire economic woe? Who cares, we like it. Erotokritos, the French label who are one of fashion diary's particular favourites, have also taken their spring/summer collection into the ether on their website. We'd like dress number one please. Actually no, we'd like everything, please. Celebwatch Few A-listers made the trip to Milan. But Paris? Vive la difference! Just take a look at pictures from the Dior show: Dita von Teese, Marion Cotillard, Milla Jovovich, Katy Perry, Lily Allen, Stephanie Seymour, Harry Potter star Emma Watson, Zoe Saldana, Eva Green and Roisin Murphy were all there in the limelight. Just how many women can Brit John Galliano have perched on the edge of their seats in one go? Katy Perry was also at the Vivienne Westwood show, which ran nearly two hours late: she occupied the time chewing relentlessly at some gum and then looked distinctly bemused during the show. Us too, Katy, us too. Rumour mill 'Is the rumour true?' moans a troupe of stricken fashionistas. Martin Margiela, fashion's most notorious quiet man (he never speaks to the press), may be bowing out after 20 years in the game. The Belgian star of the Paris shows is heralded alongside Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons as one of fashion's genuine innovators (oversized, deconstructed garments resemble art pieces), and the man for whom Marc Jacobs, Alexander McQueen - you name them - are merely devoted footsoldiers. If it's true, then this 20th anniversary show was the ultimate in Maison Martin Margiela eccentricity, and a fine way to go out with a bang. Who could possibly follow in his footsteps? You don't send me Valentinos Another fashion house, another legacy issue. After Italian impressario Valentino retired from designing last year, Alessandra Facchinetti stepped into his shoes. But the truth is, she hasn't been a rip-roaring success, and this week's worst-kept secret is that it's only a matter of time before someone else - Giambattista Valli - is brought in to save the legendary label's reputation. Will all these fashion icons stop retiring at the same time? Bouncerwatch Poor Lenny Kravitz - he was apparently initially refused entry into Rick Owens' already packed-out show. Humiliating enough? His 19-year-old daughter Zoe had pride of place in the front row. And finally Yves St Laurent platform heels and ankle boots galore at the Louvre? It can only be Paris fashion week. If, however, you avoid the \"must-have\" and \"get-it-before-it-goes\" hysteria and prefer shopping rather more ethically then we recommend you head to 15 Blenheim Crescent, off the Portobello Road, this weekend. That's where you will find gorgeous Kitty Cooper shoes, which are all hand-made using vintage and recycled fabrics and non-chemical dyed leather. Press and studio samples will be marked down as much as 85% and if you mention being a theguardian.com reader (don't be ashamed, we love you too) you'll even get an extra 10% off! Never let it be said we don't help you dress well here at fashion diary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
