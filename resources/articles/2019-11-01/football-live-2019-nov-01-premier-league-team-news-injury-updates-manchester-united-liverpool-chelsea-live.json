And that\u2019s the full-time whistle for today\u2019s blog. Thanks for reading everyone! Norwich boss Daniel Farke says his side will not become obsessed by league position as they look to climb the table with victory at Brighton this weekend. The Canaries have slipped to second bottom after four defeats in the last five although they did manage a 0-0 draw at Bournemouth in their last away game. \u201cWe can\u2019t doubt ourselves. We have to be self-critical but believe in our principles. We have to stick together,\u201d parped Farke. \u201cOur supporters know we face a tough time, but the players try everything. We\u2019re not addicted to looking at the table. We want to win games and let it take care of itself. That\u2019s the approach we had last season and we had a brilliant finish.\u201d As for team news, goalkeeper Tim Krul is fit again after being injured against Manchester United but Onel Hernandez could be an absentee as his partner awaits the birth of their child. Mario Vrancic misses out through illness, while Todd Cantwell (hamstring) and Ibrahim Amadou (knee) are doubts. Ready for The Fiver? Your fifth-favourite tea-timely football email asks if you can spare a thought for Nathan Jones, his hopes of becoming \u201cthe world\u2019s best manager\u201d temporarily dashed after being given the boot by Stoke. If Aston Villa want to upset leaders Liverpool on Saturday, having Jack Grealish available would be a big help. The midfielder suffered a calf injury at Manchester City last weekend and missed the Carabao Cup win against Wolves. But Villa boss Dean Smith is hopeful he can return. \u201cJack has been out there training today. He\u2019s still a little bit sore but he is in contention to start and he wants to start,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI said earlier in the week that when there\u2019s contact injuries on soft tissues then you\u2019re going to get a small bleed in there, which he\u2019s got. But it\u2019s not going to do too much harm to him going out there, once adrenaline kicks in you feel very little anyway. There\u2019s no long term issue with that type of injury, the decision I have to make is whether he is fit enough to start because we are up against the current champions of Europe and you need all 11 players to be physically right to go and produce on that day. My only call is whether he can go and produce the standards that we expect of him.\u201d Let\u2019s cross to Spain to check in on Eden Hazard. Just over a year ago, then Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri was suggesting that the Belgian could score 40 goals that season. He didn\u2019t, managing 21 instead. For Real Madrid this term he\u2019s managed just one in eight. This is what boss Zinedine Zidane makes of it: \u201cHazard? We can all see he\u2019s playing better. Perhaps he could score a bit more often but we\u2019re not concerned. We\u2019re happy with what he\u2019s doing on the pitch and he\u2019s getting better every day. Players of Hazard\u2019s quality can see things that others simply aren\u2019t capable of seeing. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been timid, quite the opposite. Everyone wants to see him get better and I think he\u2019s improving every day. We\u2019ll all be happy with him but we have to take it easy.\u201d Fair enough, but who would have predicted that we\u2019d reach November and find that Tammy Abraham has scored eight times as many goals as the cover star of FIFA 20? Liverpool have temporarily suspended the fan responsible for the offensive Divock Origi banner spotted during the Reds\u2019 Champions League game at Genk last week. The PA news agency reports that the supporter has been informed by letter/e-mail and must reply within 14 days. In the meantime, he has been denied access to any Liverpool matches after a meeting of the club\u2019s Sanctions Panel. Final punishments range from a full ban, a ban and education, education on its own or other minor sanctions. Liverpool condemned the Photoshopped banner of the striker for \u201cperpetuating a racial stereotype\u201d. Some fulsome praise from Brendan Rodgers for midfielder Wilfred Ndidi. \u201cHe is an incredible player. The offensive players get the credit but he does the dirty work,\u201d cooed Rodgers. \u201cHe has this brain for the game, where he can smell danger and always finds himself there. The timing of his challenge is very good and he\u2019s up there with the top players at winning the ball back. When you play a pressing game you need someone like Wilf. His passing is good too, he\u2019s always smiling.\u201d Good to know he smiles a lot but the stats also confirm what his boss says. Ndidi has made more interceptions (32) than anyone in the Premier League this season and ranks second for tackles (45). Brendan Rodgers hasn\u2019t been sat in his underpants at home, rewinding the goals in Leicester\u2019s 9-0 win at Southampton whilst chewing through a bag of Haribo Fantasy Mix. Oh, no. The Foxes boss has resisted any such temptations to bask. \u201cNo, we\u2019ve already had a game (3-1 Carabao Cup win at Burton). We\u2019ve already reflected on the performance, you have got to take the real positives from it. There were other areas where we could have scored more, there was a period between the 58th minute and the 84th minute where we didn\u2019t score. Throughout the game our pressing, our intensity, was very good and it shows the players have learned.\u201d Some news from Scotland now, where Celtic are preparing to take on Hibs in the Betfred Cup semi-final at Hampden Park on Saturday. It looks as if they\u2019ll have to do so without skipper Scott Brown, who is struggling with a thigh strain. Then again, there\u2019s a fair chance they\u2019ll cope having won the last nine domestic trophies on offer in Scotland. Lennon isn\u2019t resting on his laurels, though, and wants to extend that run into double figures and beyond: \u201cIt is part of the domestic trophy haul we have kept hold of for the last three years. The players are highly motivated to defend the trophy, they are in great form, so there is a lot of incentive there for us.\u201d Let me be Frank with you - to quote cult comedian Frankie Tan. Anyway, here are some bog-standard \u2018respect the opposition\u2019 quotes from Frank Lampard, uttered in complete sincerity despite his rampant young Chelsea bucks being ruthless on the road (four straight Premier League away wins; 16 goals scored in the process) and ready to create more havoc at winless Watford: \u201cWe saw what they did last year, getting big results and regularly being a very strong team and making the FA Cup final. We cannot underestimate the team that will be hurting because they haven\u2019t won for a while and will have every ambition to try and win this game, so I certainly have even more focus on what we need to do.\u201d Thanks Ben. I\u2019ll open with some Everton teams news. Marco Silva will make a late call on defender Yerry Mina ahead of the home game against Spurs on Sunday. The Colombian was forced off with a knee problem in the first half of the Toffees\u2019 2-0 Carabao Cup win over Watford on Tuesday. \u201cHe worked with the team this morning. It was nothing serious, what he has in his knee at this moment. It\u2019s just a matter of him having the conditions to support the pain he has in this moment,\u201d said Silva. \u201cIf he can do that, he can train and possibly he can play as well. Today he did in the morning all the session, let\u2019s see how he will react tomorrow and after we will take the decisions. We hope it\u2019s nothing really special and it looks nothing special.\u201d There was certainly nothing special about Everton\u2019s performance in this fixture last season as Tottenham ran riot to win 6-2. Righto, David Tindall will guide you through the rest of the goings-on in the Premier League and beyond. Brendan Rodgers and Marco Silva are still to come. Granit Xhaka may not be signed up for the Wolves game but it\u2019s not all bad news for Arsenal: after two assists in midweek, Unai Emery says Mesut \u00d6zil and Gabriel Martinelli are ready to \u201chelp\u201d on Saturday. \u201cWe are playing a lot of matches and for them it is a challenge each match to show how they are and how they can help us,\u201d Emery said. \u201cThe performance on Wednesday in Liverpool was positive. I am thinking how they can help us tomorrow.\u201d Zing! There would be a few solutions possible but there was not one day where Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League, the Football League and the other leagues sit at a table and think about the players and not about their wallet. Pep Guardiola has sent Eddie Jones his best wishes, with the Manchester City manager wishing the England rugby union coach good luck in the World Cup final against South Africa on Saturday. Jones has previously studied Guardiola\u2019s coaching techniques. \u201cGood luck,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour for England to be in the final. For Eddie Jones, for his staff, for his players. All the best. It\u2019s an incredible event.\u201d There has been speculation this week that the Premier League may be set to ban under-12 players at academies from heading the ball, following a landmark report studying dementia in former players. Bournemouth have already acted to stop heading at their academy and Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino was asked about the proposal during his press conference ahead of the away trip to Everton. It is a sensitive subject and we need to stay open to help the people that can provide us the better information and advice. We need to be open and try to provide the best to our kids because they are the future of football, the country, life and world. It is a sensitive thing that we need to listen to people that have the knowledge.\u201d Emery looks pretty weary and seems unsure how best to cope with the storm surrounding Xhaka. He leans forward and says he does not plan to involve Xhaka against Wolves at the Emirates and it is difficult to envisage that changing. After being jeered off against Crystal Palace, the Swiss midfielder said he \u201creached boiling point\u201d as a result of threats to his wife and daughter. Xhaka has started all but one of Arsenal\u2019s league games this season: More from Unai Emery on Xhaka-gate: He is training. He didn\u2019t play in Liverpool for me he is continuing, above all [we are] focusing on tomorrow. The human, like everyone, feels. Xhaka\u2019s issues last week is one issue that needs time. He needs time to recover the normality in him. He said sorry, he gave the apology to the supporters and to everybody. Now is the focus on the match. We were waiting on [until] Monday and Tuesday [to sort out the captaincy]. Now we need to be focussed 100 per cent only on the match. We are going to do the training today but at the moment it is not in my mind. I want to speak about the players who are going to play.\u201d Pochettino says Dele Alli needs support, and not stick: We need to remember that he\u2019s so young and the pressure is massive. He\u2019s English and everybody expects big things from him but he\u2019s still 23 years old. He was fantastic then he dropped a bit in his performance but we must back him. We have to pay attention, to focus and try to improve in the way that everyone expects.\u201d Roma are keen on making Chris Smalling a permanent addition: Chelsea team news: Frank Lampard says Antonio R\u00fcdiger is not fit and that the defender has an appointment with a consultant on Monday, with a view to sussing out a pelvic problem. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is closing on a return but this weekend comes too early for the France midfielder. \u201cRoss Barkley is still not quite right, he\u2019s not far away. Andreas Christensen is pretty much fit as well, so it\u2019s the finishing touches for a few of these ones. There is a difference between fit and match-fit.\u201d Give this a whirl: Pep Guardiola says he sympathises with J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who has said elite players are simply playing too much football. \u201cI\u2019m completely with Jurgen when he makes these statements, it\u2019s too much,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we have bigger squads, how do we pay them? We need less fixtures, less competitions, more recovery. But I have been in meetings and it\u2019s always the same. We just talk about it. I had to prioritise Ilkay G\u00fcndogan for the last game \u2013 no Kevin de Bruyne, no David Silva. Other clubs do the same.\u201d Unai Emery says his club captain will not play a part. Mauricio Pochettino is not a happy bunny. The Tottenham manager says he is \u201cnot happy\u201d with Argentina calling up of Giovani Lo Celso, who has only just returned to the Spurs fold after picking up a muscle injury on international duty in September. Meanwhile, Jan Vertonghen is a doubt for Sunday\u2019s game at Everton with a hamstring injury. \u00c9rik Lamela remains injured after missing the 2-1 defeat at Liverpool, while Danny Rose will miss out through suspension. Hodgson says Andros Townsend is unlikely to be fit for Sunday after sustaining a muscle strain against Arsenal. \u201cLeicester are coming in off the back of two good results \u2013 last weekend and the Carabao Cup,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cWe hope they don\u2019t play like they did against Southampton.\u201d You can say that again Roy ... Roy Hodgson is in talks over extending his Crystal Palace stay, with a contract that will take him beyond his 73rd birthday. Hodgson, who turned 72 in August, is out of contract next summer but the club are keen to hand him a new deal following Palace\u2019s good start to the season. Palace, who host high-flying Leicester on Sunday, are sixth after the opening 10 Premier League matches. \u201cI heard today that Donald Trump who is a bit older than me is planning to stay on as President of the USA for another five years,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cIt\u2019s an important job, but not quite as important as being the leader of the free world.\u201d Manchester United are offering free flights to fans for their Europa League game at Khazakstan\u2019s Astana in late November, following Thomas Cook\u2019s insolvency. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe have been working through a range of contingency plans to minimise the impact of the Thomas Cook situation for our supporters. We are pleased to be able to confirm that Manchester United will be operating a complimentary trip to the forthcoming match against FC Astana in Kazakhstan for those who were impacted by the insolvency of Thomas Cook.\u201d It sounds as though Fabinho could be given a breather by Klopp this weekend, with the Brazilian a booking away from suspension. Much could hinge on Naby Ke\u00efta \u2013 a doubt for Saturday \u2013 overcoming an injury sustained during the second half against Arsenal in midweek but taking Fabinho out of the firing line is the only way to guarantee the midfielder will be available face Manchester City on 10 November. Klopp has Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Adam Lallana, while he could always turn to his raft of youngsters, with Curtis Jones, Pedro Chirivella and Herbie Kane alternative midfield options, if need be. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible playing against Villa to play without [making] challenges,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThe player knows this, I know this. Maybe he has to deal with it on the pitch or I have to deal with it with the line-up. I didn\u2019t make a final decision yet so we will see.\u201d Klopp has told the game\u2019s bigwigs to think \u201cabout the players and maybe not their wallet\u201d when it comes to fixture congestion. The German said he does not want to be drawn over whether clubs simply play too many games ... and then ends up flowing into a mild-mannered and passionate rant of sorts: The discussion is obvious, that it is too much. Everyone involved in the game knows. Nobody wants to touch it, nobody really discusses about it. Then Uefa decides to make the Nations League, give the successful players a couple of more intense games. People then say you need a bigger squad. The game is not made for bigger squads. At the moment there is a imbalance between the number of players in the squad, the competitions you play and a big gap between the breaks the boys need. They have two weeks off a year, in a physically demanding game. The solutions, I think there are a few possible, but the leagues have to sit and really discuss and think about the players and maybe not their wallet. We discuss it always on the back of the money we earn. Somebody has to think about how many games.\u201d Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to make his 100th Liverpool appearance against Aston Villa on Saturday and Klopp has been effusive in his praise of the England defender, who turned 21 last month. Klopp says it\u2019s a pleasure to work with him: He\u2019s so young and already so experienced. It\u2019s a wonderful story for different reasons. I know that in Liverpool everyone was desperate to have a \u2018scouse\u2019 hero making his way into the first team. When he made his first appearance he said \u2018great, but it\u2019s not about having one game, it\u2019s about having 100\u2019. Now we can talk about that, and there was not a lot of bad games in that 100. I wish for him to stay healthy and fit, and then the future\u2019s bright for him and for us. He\u2019s a great role model. He\u2019s relaxed about that but feels responsible as well.\u201d Right, let\u2019s get a load of J\u00fcrgen Klopp. The Liverpool boss says Naby Ke\u00efta is a doubt to face Aston Villa, while the defender Jo\u00ebl Matip is still a few weeks away from returning to action. On the subject of fixture congestion in December, Klopp says the club is yet to find a solution and could send select different squads for the Carabao Cup and Club World Cup games, if need be: We have discussed it already and we have to because there\u2019s not much time to make that decision. If we do play [the Carabao Cup] while we are in Qatar, that will be two different teams. But we cannot leave any players at home for the Carabao Cup. We have two games in a busy period and it\u2019s not like we can go there [Qatar] with 11 players. It doesn\u2019t work like this. We have to make a decision but not yet.\u201d Where did it all go wrong for Nathan Jones? We haven\u2019t got all day, but here are a few pointers to get the ball rolling. After 14 games, only Barnsley\u2019s inferior goal difference prevented the most expensively assembled squad in the Championship \u2013 at more than \u00a3143m \u2013 from sitting bottom of the pile. There are more than \u00a350m-worth of players out on loan, including the club\u2019s \u00a318.3m record signing, Giannelli Imbula, and Kevin Wimmer, for whom they paid \u00a318m, indicators of where this malaise began. There will be a slew of press conferences to get stuck into shortly but first: confirmation that Stoke have indeed sacked Nathan Jones. Stoke say they will make a new managerial appointment \u201cas swiftly as possible\u201d but, until then, Rory Delap, Kevin Russell and Andy Quy will take caretaker charge. \u201cI would like to thank John and Peter Coates, firstly for the opportunity to manage this football club and then for the continued support and patience throughout my time here,\u201d Jones said in a statement. \u201cI would also like to thank the supporters for their fantastic support. Finally, I wish the club the very best for the future.\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp will be chewing the fat shortly. The Liverpool manager will likely be waxing lyrical about the several youngsters that shone, and kept their cool, in the penalty shootout victory over Arsenal on Wednesday. It was a memorable occasion for Curtis Jones, Neco Williams and Harvey Elliott and Sepp van den Berg, while the 20-year-old goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher was arguably the hero on the night. Rhian Brewster was also involved. Whether any youngsters feature at Villa Park on Saturday remains to be seen \u2013 it feels unlikely \u2013 but all enhanced their reputations. A bit of breaking news in the Championship ... Stoke are understood to have sacked Nathan Jones, with the club set to confirm his dismissal shortly. Stoke are second bottom in the division having lost 10 of their 14 games this season, including their past two matches at Sheffield Wednesday and Millwall. Stoke take on league leaders West Brom on Monday. After victory over Swansea last month, Jones, who has won just six of his 38 matches in charge, said: \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of thinking and soul searching over the last week and I\u2019m a passionate guy, [and] that\u2019s got me the career I\u2019ve had. I\u2019ve had to work my socks off to get where I am because I was never blessed with any ability. I never had four-year contracts where I could chill out, relax and get a cigar out. I had to fight for every part of my career and it\u2019s the same as a manager.\u201d What more could you want? [Thierry] Henry tells me to shut up, this time with a lot of swear words included. And in hindsight it is good advice. But I am not taking it on. I shout back that he is the one who should shut up. He runs in my direction, confronts me, yells into my face, says all kinds of things. He totally ignores the fact that the game is going on around us. Ashley Cole and Sol Campbell get involved: \u2018Carry on, Nicklas, keep on running and shut your mouth.\u2019 And I do. I become unusually calm. That is what happens if one of the best forwards in the world stands there and shouts at you.\u201d How high can Leicester go this season? The sense seems to be that it will again be a two-horse race for the title, with Liverpool out in front, closely followed by Manchester City but Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side, and indeed Chelsea, are not so far behind. As Dean Smith said before Aston Villa were swept aside last weekend, City are not infallible and Liverpool, too, are not flawless. When Rodgers was asked about odds on his side winning the league shortening to around 50/1 following their 9-0 demolition of Southampton, he smiled and said: \u201cWe just want to finish as high as possible and I\u2019d never put any limits on that.\u201d Leicester travel to Crystal Palace on Sunday in search of a fourth straight win. J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Mauricio Pochettino and Unai Emery will be chatting a little later but, until then, a quick glance at the Championship. Bottom club Barnsley host Bristol City at Oakwell in Friday only\u2019s game, before a bumper Saturday, with Derby taking on Middlesbrough and Leeds entertaining QPR. Then second-placed Preston travel to Charlton on Sunday. Amazingly, Preston\u2019s entire starting XI last time out cost a grand total of ... \u00a31.6m: How about these for grand plans? Crystal Palace are determined to tap into the hotbed of south London talent by building a \u00a320m academy centre. In today\u2019s Rumour Mill, Palace are credited with an interest in Liverpool\u2019s Rhian Brewster but, down the line, maybe they will develop their own striking prodigy: Solskj\u00e6r has heralded the October international break as a key factor in easing Manchester United back to form. The Norwegian says it was a much-needed breather before earning a draw against Premier League pacesetters Liverpool and picking up wins at Partizan Belgrade, Norwich and Chelsea. [It] came at a great time for us. We did some work, prepared for the Liverpool game, and when you get a decent performance and result against the league leaders it gives you more energy and from then on the boys have been happy with the work we\u2019ve done. Maybe the change of system has helped and the coaches have done a great job.\u201d A dab more from Solskj\u00e6r. There is no chance of Luke Shaw, Axel Tuanzebe or Nemanja Matic facing Bournemouth. \u201cThey\u2019re not ready for tomorrow, that\u2019s the update,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably after the international break [they\u2019ll be back]. It is always a risk if you push them back too early, but if we have the two extra weeks after the international break they should all be ready for then.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r says Marcus Rashford, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindel\u00f6f are indeed injury doubts. The Manchester United manager said the trio are touch-and-go to face Bournemouth. Hopefully we can get them back on the pitch tomorrow. They had some treatment yesterday, a little more today, [they took part in] a light session and hopefully they\u2019re ready. Since Anthony Martial came back then Marcus has blossomed as well. He\u2019s probably happier facing goal, being direct and taking players on, rather than that target man with his back to goal. Marcus wants to master all the skills.\u201d Steve Bruce has been bigging up Newcastle\u2019s chances of rocketing up the Premier League. His side take on West Ham at the London Stadium on Saturday having won one of their past eight matches. As for team news, Andy Carroll could feature against his former club, while Fabian Sch\u00e4r and Matt Ritchie will miss out. Sch\u00e4r, Bruce says, could return against Bournemouth next weekend. Man United are seventh and they\u2019ve won three games. Two or three points separate a vast amount of teams. If you put back-to-back wins together, you shoot up the table, and that has to be our aim. We\u2019re quietly confident we can go to West Ham and get a result. I think we all feel as though we\u2019re not far off. We\u2019ve had a couple of magic moments by beating Spurs and Man United. The consistency looks to have arrived defensively. The front three are still settling in. We\u2019re aware of it, we have to improve, but I think we\u2019ll get there. The players enjoy coming in \u2013 there\u2019s a good spirit among the group and around the training ground.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will be previewing Manchester United\u2019s trip to Bournemouth shortly, with the manager likely to give an update on the fitness of Victor Lindel\u00f6f, Marcus Rashford and Harry Maguire, who all picked up niggles at Stamford Bridge in midweek. Paul Pogba is sidelined until December but, by next summer, United get their hands on a new prized possession: \u201cIs Batshuayi going to get a chance again after that goal against Manchester United, or will he be back on the bench?\u201d asks Machine2481 below the line. It was a goal that will only enhance Batshuayi\u2019s chances of game-time but, more than anything, it will probably just cement his place as Tammy Abraham\u2019s deputy for the time being, with Olivier Giroud not given a minute of action off the bench. Giroud has scored in three of his past four appearances for France but has barely had a sniff for Chelsea. \u201cThey [Chelsea fans] love Tammy, but the outstanding moment of the game from our point of view was Michy in terms of finish and strength,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy when another striker\u2019s scoring and you\u2019re not getting involved much, but he has shown something in training.\u201d Whet the appetite for the weekend: Eddie Howe is an early bird. The Bournemouth manager has been previewing Manchester United\u2019s visit on Saturday lunchtime. \u201cThey have played very well recently, they have quality players and a manager that\u2019s given them real stability. We have to show more than our last home game [0-0 against Norwich] and get the supporters on our side.\u201d Dan Gosling, who underwent surgery in the summer, could make his first appearance of the season. After some riveting cup action, back into the thick of it. First thing\u2019s first, and as scarcely believable as it may seem, Manchester United could win a fourth successive game on Saturday, if they pick up three points at not so sunny Bournemouth. Then there\u2019s Granit Xhaka v The Emirates part II, as Arsenal host Wolves and the small fry of Liverpool going to Villa Park. Plus, there is a 6-1 shellacking to look forward to, with Southampton determined to avoid another pasting at Manchester City. We\u2019ll be hearing from managers and hoovering up nuggets from across the Premier League and beyond. Saturday Bournemouth v Manchester United 12.30pm (GMT) Arsenal v Wolves Aston Villa v Liverpool Brighton v Norwich Manchester City v Southampton Sheffield United v Burnley West Ham v Newcastle Watford v Chelsea 5.30pm Sunday Crystal Palace v Leicester 2pm Everton v Tottenham 4.30pm *all 3pm kick-offs unless specified"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
