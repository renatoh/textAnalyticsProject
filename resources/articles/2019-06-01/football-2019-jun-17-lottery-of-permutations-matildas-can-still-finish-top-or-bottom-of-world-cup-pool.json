For travelling Matildas supporters, trying to anticipate where they should be for the round of 16 is a logistical nightmare. And that\u2019s before you contemplate the unthinkable: with a loss against Jamaica (by a margin of +4) Australia could yet finish last in Group C and face group stage ignominy not experienced since 2003. So what are the possible scenarios? With Barbara Bonansea\u2019s 90+5 minute opening-game winner the group was turned on its head \u2013 but remarkably, the Matildas could still finish first, second, third or fourth in a topsy-turvy pool. It\u2019s a situation set to delight folk who plot probability trees in their spare time, exploring algorithmic variabilities that would give Deep Blue pause for thought. But it\u2019s not so delightful for professional athletes like Emily Gielnik, whose skill base is anchored in excellence in other areas. \u201cI really don\u2019t know, I\u2019m hoping for Brazil \u2013 oh wait, who do we need to win?\u201d she asked media on Sunday. \u201cWhoever needs to win I\u2019m hoping they win \u2013 I think Italy. It\u2019s Italy isn\u2019t it? See I don\u2019t know the mathematical side, it\u2019s too much!\u201d After a 5-0 demolition of Jamaica, Italy have put themselves in the box seat to qualify top. But with a final game loss to Brazil by a few goals, Australia has a window of opportunity \u2013 if they can beat Jamaica by five or more. The first key here is to turnaround the +6 goal difference that currently stands between Italy and Australia, but ensuring that Brazil\u2019s +2 goal advantage is also overturned. A 3-1 win to Brazil and a 5-0 win to Australia: happy days. A 6-1 win to Brazil and a 2-0 win to Australia: dias felizes. For all that the first scenario is feasible, in probability land it\u2019s highly unlikely, as lapsed astro-physicist Ben Mayhew has plotted: Probability calculations have been wrong before, but build in real-world factors like the suspension of Formiga for Brazil\u2019s crunch game with Italy and the ongoing fitness question marks over Marta, and an Italy side brimming with confidence in reality should be good value for at least a point. Realistically, Australia are on track to finish second in the group \u2013 a win or a draw for Italy ensures they finish top, and a win for Australia over Jamaica will send Matildas fans rushing to book train, plane or steam omnibus tickets to Nice. The case for Australia finishing third is slender \u2013 but it\u2019s a scenario that has multiple pathways for getting there. Most importantly though, unlike the case for finishing top or second, its an outcome that can be 100% determined by the Matildas themselves. Win or draw against Jamaica, and they\u2019re going through. In the increasingly psychological world of professional sport \u2013 this would be the message Ante Milicic would be telling his charges: we look after what we can look after, and the outcome is what it is. As Hayley Raso told media on Sunday: \u201cWe can\u2019t think too far ahead because it all dependent on other results \u2026 It\u2019s more about knowing we need to get a result in this game coming up.\u201d Alors. Still with us so far? Now the final permutations to consider \u2013 and that\u2019s which side of the draw Australia then goes onto, should it progress to the knockout stages. Major upsets withstanding, tournament favourites France, England and the United States are all on track to qualify top of their respective groups placing them all in the top half of the draw. In a match up that could blow the whole tournament wide open the two runaway favourites, France and USA, could even square off in the quarter-finals. Should the Matildas finish top and secure a bottom half draw, it\u2019s a return to Montpellier and a likely Round of 16 showing against either Nigeria, Spain or China, or Chile. Should Australia finish second, they\u2019re off to Nice and into the \u2018half of death\u2019. Group A runners-up \u2013 potentially Norway \u2013 await in the last 16, with an equally tasty quarter-final clash with England looming, should the Matildas win through. Finish third however and the Matildas will await the lottery of the permutations that flow from a six-pool tournament. Le Havre or Grenoble would be the destinations with hosts France or world No 2 Germany most likely awaiting. Put very simply therefore, the better Australia finish, the \u2018easier\u2019 an opponent awaits, at least immediately. If predictions are a mug\u2019s game then mapping permutations is even worse. All of which points to an easy message in camp: worry about what we can control and we take what comes, if and when it does. Asked if she\u2019d rather secure an outcome that avoids hosts France, Gielnik was on much surer ground. \u201cYou know what? I think everybody probably thinks that, but there\u2019s been big upsets in football. And if it came to that, bring it on \u2013 I\u2019d love to play France. So if it falls that way, then let\u2019s go.\u201d Before all that though, there\u2019s the question of Jamaica on Tuesday. If your head is already spinning, never has the elite sportsperson\u2019s clich\u00e9 been more apt: we just take it one game at a time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
