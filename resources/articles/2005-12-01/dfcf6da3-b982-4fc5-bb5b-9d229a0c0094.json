In fact the report estimated that 35% of households would be made up of people living alone. The report was published in October, not last month. Our obituary of the academic and author Benjamin DeMott, page 37, December 16, said he had gone to Amherst College, part of the University of Massachusetts. Amherst College is an independent liberal arts college and not part of the University of Massachusetts. The artist who is working on the installation All the Gold in the World with Rollo Contemporary Art is Giancarlo Neri, not Nero (Corrections, page 30, December 14). We said in an obituary of the actor John Spencer, page 28, yesterday, that he had appeared in a made-for-television film of Joseph Ambush's Jury of One. That should have been Joseph Wambaugh. Ian Hart was listed among the actors who appear in Lassie in Film &amp; Music, page 8, December 16. He does not have a role in the film. Nadolig Llawen is Happy Christmas in Welsh, not Nadoilg Llawen (The night class before Christmas, Work, page 5, December 17).
