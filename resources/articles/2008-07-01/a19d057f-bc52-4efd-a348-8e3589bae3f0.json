It's an ultra-girly Brit comedy based on the books by Louise Rennison, targeted with laser-guided calculation on a tweenie-to-teen female demographic. The result is a bit too cheesy and icky, but I can't help reflecting that movies for 14-year-old girls like this are destined to be patronised, while movies for 14-year-boys like Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight get treated with saucer-eyed respect by the overwhelmingly male commentariat. Anyway, this is directed by Gurinder Chadha, of Bend It Like Beckham fame and, like her famous footballing film, it features a realistically not-conventionally-pretty heroine, paired up with a conventionally pretty best friend who does here in fact speak a bit like Keira Knightley. (There is a pre-emptive gag to that effect.) The lead character is Georgia, a bright, shy girl who dreams of snagging the perfect boyfriend. She is played by the excellent Georgia Groome, who first surfaced in Paul Andrew Williams's tough thriller London to Brighton and here demonstrates a nicely judged gift for goofy comedy; she reminds me of a very young Caroline Quentin, a comparison probably prompted by the fact that Alan Davies plays her embarrassing dad. She is a likable presence, but the film is itself is a bit too cringeworthy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
