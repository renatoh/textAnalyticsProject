Ten cranes, he'd claimed, flying over his home, just three miles from our own. It seemed so unbelievable and yet so painfully possible. I should explain that cranes have been in Norfolk for 25 years and have steadily increased until there are now over 20. Unfortunately these huge, stately birds are remarkably faithful to the northern section of the Broads and seldom wander even just a few miles. One exception comes in spring, when some make a leisurely tour around southern England as far away as Kent, prior to the breeding season. This is modest compared with continental cranes, whose migration carries them from northern Europe to Iberia or Africa. It was a lack of true migratory instinct in the current British cranes that led some to doubt that they were truly wild. Rumours persisted for years that they were tame birds released from captivity. One problem was that cranes hadn't bred in Britain since the mid-16th century and no one knew how they had behaved. In fact East Anglia is about midway between the winter-and breeding-grounds of the European contingent and our birds probably never migrated. But the mist of uncertainty shrouded a development that should have been trumpeted as one of the most remarkable in British ornithology. This afternoon the cranes' homecoming touched me personally - five magnificent slow-winged giants in a procession visible from my window. Now I can't wait for tomorrow's post to share my delirious excitement ... and to beg forgiveness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
