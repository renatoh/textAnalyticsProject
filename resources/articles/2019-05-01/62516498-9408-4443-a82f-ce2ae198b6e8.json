After taking part in the 1831 rebellion that catalysed the end of slavery in his country of birth, Buchanan\u2019s tragedy was that he never got to reap the benefits \u2013 instead he was imprisoned and sent as a convict to Australia, never to return. Sienna Brown came across his story while working as a guide at Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park Barracks, which in the early days of colonial New South Wales housed convicts. Though raised in Canada, Brown was born in Jamaica. \u201cI thought, let me just see if any of my fellow countrymen were actually there,\u201d she says. Research uncovered a handful \u2013 but it was Buchanan\u2019s story that stood out. Brown\u2019s debut novel, Master of My Fate, gives a fictionalised look into Buchanan\u2019s life, tapping into some uncomfortable truths from Australia\u2019s history that are often overlooked: that much of colonial Australia was built by convict labour; that Australia has its own quiet history of abusing an unpaid workforce; that slavery isn\u2019t that far in the past. Buchanan took part in the 1831 Slave Rebellion led by Samuel Sharpe, and this was ultimately why he was sent to Australia as a convict. Though this was a great catalysing event in his life, it isn\u2019t the book\u2019s focus. The bulk of the novel centres on his life on the plantation, showing us exactly what drove this man to risk his life for freedom. \u201cThe real intention of the book wasn\u2019t to talk about the big global thing of slavery,\u201d Brown says. \u201cIt was to talk about the human side.\u201d Brown points to an unintentional ignorance of history \u2013 both her own, prior to researching the novel, and that of the general public. \u201cI don\u2019t think people realise, if you\u2019re walking along Macquarie Street for instance, all of those colonial buildings \u2026 they were all built by convict labour.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just a handful of Jamaicans; Brown points out that large numbers of South Sea Islander people were kidnapped too, and brought to work on the sugar plantations in Queensland. Their descendants are still fighting for recognition. \u201cIt\u2019s always an assumption that [slavery is] an African American/North American thing,\u201d she says. \u201cBut really, the British had slavery all within their colonies.\u201d The novel also touches on the treatment of Australia\u2019s Indigenous peoples by the colonising forces. \u201cI did want to acknowledge it,\u201d Brown says. \u201cI felt that was an important point to make even though I don\u2019t go into it.\u201d Brown originally intended to write a more academic book, but fiction gave her the freedom to depict William\u2019s life through his own eyes. Humanising William was important to her. \u201cWhen we think about slaves we have this picture of just these bodies of people that horrible things were imprinted on. Whereas they had a life outside of being enslaved,\u201d Brown says. \u201cThat was really what I was trying to get across \u2026 that understanding that they\u2019re human beings.\u201d Master of My Fate takes readers through the experience of living as a slave on Jamaica\u2019s sugar plantations, detailing the rampant sexual assault, the beatings, the callous separation of families. This isn\u2019t the most harrowing aspect of the book, however; that\u2019s its undercurrent of us and them, of lack of empathy. \u201cIt was deep and dark,\u201d Brown says of the research. \u201cThere were some days I was so depressed reading about what people did to each other.\u201d Power dynamics are a chief concern of the novel. Brown doesn\u2019t simply focus on the bludgeon of slavery, but also teases out the implications of those more subtle shifts: the semi-sympathetic whites toying with the idea of abolition, but who are not quite ready to accept the blow to their wealth; the sailors who prioritise money over the health of the convicts; and the slaves who turn on one another \u2013 testifying untruths in court, whispering lies to the master. Asked what all this says about human nature, Brown pauses. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same no matter what the circumstances,\u201d she says eventually. \u201cThere would have been always a power struggle within those communities because obviously everyone\u2019s wanting to survive \u2026 Everyone\u2019s wanting to get as much power as they can to keep their family safe, which would have set up a terrible situation.\u201d Stripping someone of their humanity because of the colour of their skin, because they have a criminal record, because they were born into the wrong family \u2013 as much as Master of My Fate is a book about the past, its themes are disturbingly relevant. So, too, is fighting back. \u201cI\u2019m amazed [William] survived to be honest,\u201d Brown says. \u201cPsychologically, I can\u2019t imagine. That\u2019s what kept driving me through the story.\u201d \u2022 Master of My Fate by Sienna Brown is out now through Vintage"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
