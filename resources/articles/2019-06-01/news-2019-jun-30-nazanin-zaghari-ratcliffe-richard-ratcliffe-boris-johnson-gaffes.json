Richard Ratcliffe and his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, had been refusing food for 15 days in protest at her imprisonment. More than 100 MPs, including the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, had visited his makeshift camp outside the Iranian embassy in London to show support. His wife, who has been in prison since 2016 after being accused of spying, also ended her protest on Saturday. \u201cIt was getting hard for me but I\u2019m sure it was much harder for her,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cI\u2019m relieved because I wouldn\u2019t have wanted her to push it much longer.\u201d His wife had been under \u201ca lot of pressure\u201d from guards to break the strike and had been feeling nauseous. \u201cIt had been a real struggle for her the last few days ... I think she will go to the clinic as soon as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cMy experience has been sitting on a doorstep, lots of people coming up to me with flowers and cards, so it has been emotionally great, although a physical challenge.\u201d His wife had eaten some porridge with apple and banana, he said. The couple\u2019s five-year-old daughter, Gabriella, understood her parents were ending their protest, but had suggested \u201cDaddy should carry on for a bit\u201d as Zaghari-Ratcliffe had not been released. \u201cBut we clarified that I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. The protest had irritated Iranian diplomats in London, said Ratcliffe. \u201cThey were tweeting us, almost trolling us, on social media and various articles claiming I was breaking the Vienna convention. We have certainly got them crosser than we intended but part of the aim was to bring the problem to their doorstep so I\u2019m glad that happened.\u201d Johnson, who told a Commons committee when he was foreign secretary that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was \u201cteaching people journalism\u201d in Iran, should acknowledge his mistake, he said. Iranian officials cited his words as evidence that she had engaged in \u201cpropaganda against the regime\u201d. The family have always maintained she was visiting relatives in Iran when she was arrested. She has strenuously denied spying. She was sentenced to five years in prison for attempting to overthrow the Iranian government. \u201cOf course it\u2019s not all [Johnson\u2019s] fault,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cClearly we are camped here because the Iranian authorities are imprisoning Nazanin, but he should take responsibility for his mistakes because they have consequences. Not just the gaffe \u2013 the failure to apologise afterwards clearly made things worse. I think it\u2019s bad for a candidate not to take responsibility for their mistakes because the most important thing for a prime minister is to take responsibility for their country.\u201d He said he would press his wife\u2019s case with whoever became leader. \u201cWe will be knocking on their door.\u201d Foreign secretary and Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership rival Jeremy Hunt this year granted Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection in a bid to resolve her case. But Ratcliffe said the government needed to do more to protect British citizens unfairly imprisoned or tortured. \u201cThe Foreign Office always goes softly-softly and tries not to offend the other country, but sometimes you have to protect people more strongly. That shouldn\u2019t be at the discretion of the foreign secretary. \u201cPeople can be surprised the government has no legal obligation to protect you. That\u2019s something parliament needs to change.\u201d Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe was \u201cstill a prisoner of conscience, still unfairly jailed after a sham trial, and still being subjected to the torment of separation from her home and family\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
