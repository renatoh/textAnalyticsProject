Ainooson, 29, used to be a night receptionist at the Premier Inn in Farnborough and was once training to be an accountant. Hamid, 31, lives in the quiet Cambridgeshire town of St Neots with his wife, stepson aged six, and nine-month-old daughter. They make unlikely divas. You can\u2019t imagine them throwing TVs out of hotel windows or demanding bowls of blue M&amp;Ms. \u201cWe feel so grateful and privileged,\u201d Ainooson says, when we meet in a central London private members\u2019 club. \u201cBut we\u2019re still at the beginning,\u201d Hamid adds. \u201cBecause the moment you feel \u2018I\u2019ve made it\u2019, you start to slow down.\u201d The duo, better known as Reggie N Bollie (Hamid\u2019s nickname is an acronym which stands for \u201cBest of Lyrics and Lines in Entertainment\u201d), are currently celebrating the success of a top 10 single after they were voted runners-up in The X Factor last December. They stood out on the show from the off. Amid the balladeers and boybands, Reggie N Bollie were the high-energy performers who won over the pubic with Afrobeats and unstoppable positivity. Their story, too, is not the usual reality-TV fodder. Both were born and raised in Accra, Ghana, and overcame difficult upbringings before finding success in Britain. Hamid\u2019s parents divorced when he was little and he was raised by his paternal grandparents. They died when he was 14 and he went to live with his other set of grandparents. \u201cIt made me always over-cautious,\u201d he says now. \u201cI thought: if I don\u2019t do things right for myself, I might end up in a situation where no one can help.\u201d Ainooson\u2019s father left the family before he was born. His mother remarried but that relationship broke down when Ainooson was a teenager. She was a seamstress and struggled to make ends meet, and he remembers that there was never enough money for new shoes. When he went to his first Holy Communion, his mother \u201chad to pray someone would bring her clothes for me to wear\u201d. Recently, Ainooson\u2019s eight-year-old son had his first Holy Communion \u201cand it made me so happy and proud driving my son to that: in a new suit, in a big posh car. \u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m saving money to get my mum in a nice house and to take care of her,\u201d he says. \u201cI want her to know that her only son has been able to make her smile after all that she did for me.\u201d Growing up, both Hamid and Ainooson had a love of music and won dance competitions as adolescents. But as adults they found it difficult to make a living as musicians in Ghana, despite Hamid releasing a single in 2003, You May Kiss Your Bride, which is still played at weddings across west Africa. Separately, they decided to make the move to the UK. Ainooson\u2019s wife was expecting his second child in 2010 and, he recalls, \u201cI was thinking, \u2018No, I have to give it up, forget music. I have to provide for my family.\u2019\u201d Hamid\u2019s managers thought he would stand more chance of professional success in Britain. The move was relatively smooth because Ghana is a Commonwealth country. Still, those first few years of acclimatisation were hard. Hamid and Ainooson knew each other slightly in Ghana. In the UK they cemented their friendship over the phone. \u201cWe used to call ourselves and tease ourselves because we were so broke and [we\u2019d] laugh about how broke we were,\u201d says Ainooson. \u201cWe used to say \u2018Have you ever been so broke you wish Barclays [bank] had a 50p limit of money transfer?\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cIt had got to that point! We really wanted to change our lives.\u201d Ainooson took on a series of odd jobs to make ends meet: night receptionist, food and beverage team leader. He briefly worked in a call centre chasing strangers for unpaid debt. \u201cI stopped that after two weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for me because I couldn\u2019t be nice to people on the phone.\u201d Every evening he would go to Farnborough College to study for his accountancy exams, often only getting four or five hours\u2019 sleep a night. \u201cIn an ideal world, there wouldn\u2019t be any need for migration,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut for the two of us, who were actively doing music in Ghana, there wasn\u2019t enough for us. In the UK, the systems and structures work: if you write a song, you will get money. If you\u2019re a journalist, you get paid for what you write. When you\u2019re doing so much for less money [in Ghana], you\u2019re forced to find a way out.\u201d Partly because of this, Ainooson is strongly in favour of Britain remaining part of the EU. Somewhat unexpectedly, he also reveals himself to be a fan of the prime minister. \u201cI like David Cameron\u2019s approach,\u201d Ainooson says. \u201cHe goes in there and he debates his corner, he fights. [He says] \u2018Well, we will be in the EU but we can\u2019t be giving our benefits to anyone that\u2019s coming. I would like it to be maybe you work here for three, four years before we can give you that. We will be in European Union but we need to keep our currency and all that.\u2019 \u201cSo I think Cameron is doing amazing, and if he keeps on, that\u2019s what I think the UK needs: be part of it but still be able to say, this is what works for me and that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to be part of it.\u201d They both agree Britain has been \u201cwelcoming\u201d. Ainooson only experienced racism once \u201cand it was a black guy like me!\u201d He whoops with laughter. After arriving in the UK, the pair still got together to make music as a hobby \u2013 for a while, they wanted to call themselves Fullish Men until their wives said it sounded too like \u201cfoolish\u201d. Briefly they were known as Menn On Point and entered Britain\u2019s Got Talent but didn\u2019t make it past the audition stage. The X Factor was the last throw of the dice. Neither of them thought they would progress. \u201cAt the end of the day, we saw it as a way to showcase talent,\u201d says Hamid. \u201cWe expected four Nos [from the judges], but then we got four Yeses.\u201d Reggie N Bollie went on to be mentored by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and were eventually signed by Syco, Simon Cowell\u2019s record label. They returned to Ghana earlier this year to shoot the video for their debut single, New Girl, and were overwhelmed by crowds who had gathered at the airport to greet them. \u201cIt was amazing, honestly,\u201d says Hamid. \u201cWe never thought, leaving and going back, we\u2019d get that reception. To see people holding up banners and chanting our names, to tell us we were right to follow our dreams \u2026 It was really heartwarming.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
