Here's the press release stuff: To be released on 16th May 2007 across Europe and the PAL territories, Go!Cam promises to bring the creativity of film, photos and the fun of PSP together to create a camera for all ages and all occasions. With a retail price of \u20ac49.99 (\u00a334.99), Go!Cam is yet another example of how PSP is a mobile entertainment system with no limits. With up to two and half hours video recording time and the ability to take and store over 40,000 photos, Go!Cam seamlessly converts PSP to a portable, functional and fun camera. Go!Cam offers a built in microphone to ensure continuous audio, the ability to change the direction of the camera lens vertically by 180 degrees and Go!Edit, an editing software package which allows users to save and edit photos, video and audio clips. Apparently, users are also able to upload images and video directly from PSP to the internet, which is quite a nice feature considering how popular moblogging is becoming - and this is bound to be a more user-friendly system than mobile phone. Isn't it? Sadly, though, nothing about this camera resembles the headgear from a seventies sci-fi show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
