Held in the Extreme 40 class, the fastest class of boats to race in the 181-year-old event, Robertson displayed an uncanny knack in her first racing series in these ultra-fast boats - a far cry from the Yngling keelboat in which she won gold in Athens. There were 15 races over three days and the eight-boat fleet was dominated by Robert Greenhalgh's Basilica, the overall leader in the season-long event that culminates in Amsterdam next month. But Robertson's performance, with her crew of Fraser Brown, Nick Hutton and David Carr, is remarkable as she had not raced a multihull before taking on the role of helmsman of the JP Morgan Asset Management boat and she recorded two first places in this series. Places change rapidly in these boats and the final event saw Robertson in every position during the 25 minutes of close racing. The performance of the British skipper must be compared with the other woman skipper, Carolijn Brouwer in Holmatro. The two are adversaries from the singlehanded Europe class in which Robertson won gold at the Sydney Olympics. Brouwer, in Holmatro, who has moved into the Tornado class catamaran for the Olympics and finished second in the recent world championship, finished just ahead of Robertson in the final, double-points scoring race. But Robertson had a seven point lead over the Dutch woman after 14 races and finished with a five point advantage. Robertson narrowly missed beating Nick Moloney with the Australians, Darren Bundock and Glenn Ashby, double world champions in the Tornado class. They finished fourth in the last race but had an overall two-point lead over Robertson. Greenhalgh's performance was outstanding and his boat handling was measurably superior to that of his opponents. He scored nine race victories on his way to winning the Cowes grand prix. His crew comprises his brother Peter, team manager James Grant and a fellow winner of the last Volvo Ocean Race, Justin Slattery. Robert Greenhalgh and Slattery sailed on ABN Amro, the boat that dominated the round the world event. In the rather more stately racing typical of Cowes week, Luke Bradley and Peter Harrison's Farr 52, Chernikeeff 2 was the winner of Class 1 and with it the Glazebrook Challenge Cup. The 52-footer beat the previous day's winner in the class, Sir Peter Ogden's 60-foot Spirit of Jethou, with the Australian 60ft Loki in third place after finishing first across the line but unable to hold her place on handicap."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
