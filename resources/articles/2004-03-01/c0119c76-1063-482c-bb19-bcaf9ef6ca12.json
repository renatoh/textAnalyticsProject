It is as if a great tabloid Krakatoa had erupted sometime in 1999 filling the sky with an impenetrable and unsavoury headline cloud that has cast all of footieworld into perpetual shadow - though not much like it admittedly. Hardly a day goes by without new accusations of Premiership players indulging in some sordid practice or other. Piking, dogging, roasting, griddling, grouting, quantity surveying - the way footballers have explored the outer reaches of human behaviour recently it would be no surprise to read that a midfield quartet of Kinsey, Comfort, Sacher-Masoch and De Sade were turning out at Stamford Bridge. In a tabloid newspaper this week a number of Premiership stars confessed to engaging in \"hogging\" - the unsavoury practice of refusing to share their sweets with the other lads on the coach. As one manager told me: \"These revelations have shocked me to the core. It is disgusting. Everybody knows football is a team game. Be it food, showers or wives it's share and share alike.\" One self-confessed first-team \"hogger\" defended himself. \"I did used to offer stuff to the others,\" said the unnamed silhouette with the unmistakable Mohican hair-do, \"but then one day Robbie Savage had a swig of my Lilt. When he gave it back it had crisp crumbs floating in it.\" Yes, well, there's always an excuse, isn't there? \"The vast minority of my members are drunken scum,\" the PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor yelled defiantly again on Thursday. Pictures had appeared in a French newspaper apparently showing top Premiership players smiling in a concerned way as they handed out gifts of cuddly toys and chocolates to sick tots in a Romanian orphanage. \"Yes, there are players who carry on in a disgusting fashion, just as there are in every line of work,\" said the left-wing firebrand before hastily adding that he was not in anyway impugning the reputation of the old ladies who staff charity shops in northern market towns. \"But let's not forget,\" added the man who has superseded Arthur Scargill as Britain's most famous trade unionist in polls carried out in provincial shopping malls by people with blue clipboards. \"There are also halves of dozens of my members who are capable of embarking on a lager-fuelled ferreting or pebble-dashing spree at the drop of their trousers.\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger backed Taylor's claim that it was a case of \"trial by media\" saying: \"I have seen these pictures and they appear very heart-warming. But we must not rush to judgment. People are saying these players have done something positive and good but so far that has not been proven conclusively. \"For all we know, the children may have suffered an unpleasant allergic reaction to the footballers' soothing designer after-shave balm, choked on a hard centre or been embarrassed by the fact they didn't recognise these strange foreign men with their over-elaborate facial hair and suffered untold mental torment. Please let's not leap to praising people until we have all the facts.\" But are we all overreacting? Has football not always had its fair share of bad boys? Were the crazy Brylcreem-and-Brut-soaked escapades of yesteryear so very different? To find the answer I visited the 70s soccer legend Rod Rugg, who alongside team-mates Mick McMugg and Trevor Thugg formed the notorious \"Lichfield Three\", a trio who once terrorised large parts of North Staffs with their boozing, bruising and extravagantly bad teeth. \"Sex,\" Rugg growls when I raise the topic du jour. \"No. As far as Muggy, Thuggy and me-gy were concerned, shagging was for girls. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't for lack of opportunity.\" He indicates a picture on the wall behind him. It shows a young Rugg sitting in a circular bath with celebrated British actress Sophie Twickenham, star of soft-core comedy classics Ooh La La There Go My Trousers and Ooh La La There Go My Trousers (Swedish Style). \"She said may I join you in that Jacuzzi?\" Rugg cackles, \"I said, 'It's not a Jacuzzi, love, I've just had curry.' Cor we had a laugh. But there was nothing soppy went on, mark my words. \"The three of us were real men. Fighting, vomiting in cupboards and driving a stolen British Rail loco the wrong way down the dual carriageway, plastered and with our bare backsides stuck out of the windows was how we got our kicks. But doing anything illegal, that wasn't our style. \"Mind you, I'd have to say it's not football that's responsible. The whole of society has gone down the pan, hasn't it? There's no respect, there's no discipline, there's no celebrity five-a-sides with Ed 'Stewpot' Stewart and that bloke off Robin's Nest. You know who I blame for it, don't you?\" he says thrusting a sovereign-encrusted finger at me. \"Everybody else, that's who. They've ruined this country, they have.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
