Charnesia Corley, 21, who is African American, said officers with the Harris County sheriff\u2019s department held her down in a Texaco parking lot and probed her vagina in a search for marijuana. \u201cThey did a manual cavity search. It\u2019s the most serious search you can do under our constitution and should be done in a sterile environment. You sure can\u2019t do it in public by the side of the road. It\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d her attorney, Sam Cammack, told the Guardian on Tuesday. Corley, who has no criminal record, will file a complaint to the Internal Affairs Division, her attorney said. \u201cI\u2019m doing it right now,\u201d Cammack said, adding that he hoped there was video of the incident. Corley was pulled over at around 10.30pm on 21 June near Ella Boulevard and Barren Springs Drive in Houston while driving to a store in order, she said, to fetch something for her sick mother. According to the Harris County sheriff\u2019s office, a deputy pulled her over for running a stop sign. Upon smelling what he believed to be marijuana he handcuffed Corley, placed her in the back of his patrol car and searched her vehicle in vain for the drug. Upon returning to the patrol car he then allegedly smelled marijuana, concluded Corley had it hidden on her person, and summoned female deputies. One was African American, the other white. One ordered her on the ground and ordered her to pull her trousers down, Corley told ABC13. \u201cI told her, I said: \u2018Well ma\u2019am, I don\u2019t have any underwear on.\u2019 She says: \u2018Well that doesn\u2019t matter. Pull your pants down.\u2019\u201d Corley said she was ordered to open her legs but said she did not wish to do so. \u201cSo she says: \u2018Well if you don\u2019t open them, I\u2019m going to break them,\u2019\u201d Corley said. \u201cAll I could do was just lay there. I felt helpless.\u201d She told KTRK she felt violated. \u201cI feel like they sexually assaulted me. I really do. I feel disgusted, downgraded, humiliated.\u201d Corley was charged with resisting arrest and possession of marijuana after deputies allegedly found .02 ounces of marijuana. The Harris County sheriff\u2019s department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. But a spokesperson told local media the deputies did everything as they should and that Corley had assented to a strip search. Cammack disputed that and said an officer\u2019s report of the incident, which he had obtained, corroborated his client\u2019s version. The attorney declined to say where the marijuana was found but said police claimed to have found it on Corley\u2019s person. Police usually chose not to prosecute for such tiny amounts of marijuana, he added. Regardless of what was found, the search violated privacy and the constitution, said Cammack. \u201cThey could\u2019ve found a kilo of cocaine insider of her and still should not have done it.\u201d Rebecca Robertson, legal and policy director of the ACLU of Texas, said a cavity search without a warrant was a \u201cblatant\u201d violation of the fourth amendment, and that an orifice probe was the most invasive search possible. \u201cA body cavity search without a warrant would be constitutionally suspect. But a body cavity search by the side of the road ... I can\u2019t imagine a circumstance where that would be constitutional,\u201d she told the Houston Chronicle. She noted previous controversies over cavity searches in Texas. In 2013, the Department of Public Safety was forced to pay $185,000 to two women who alleged troopers had conducted cavity searches by the roadside, illuminated by patrol car headlights, in full view of passing traffic. Police in Texas came under renewed scrutiny last month over the case of Sandra Bland, an African American woman found dead in her Waller County jail cell after being detained during a traffic stop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
