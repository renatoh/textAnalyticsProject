On Thursday, as the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) political action committee endorsed Sanders\u2019 rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, Lewis appeared to play down the Vermont senator\u2019s involvement in the civil rights movement in its 1960s heyday. \u201cI never saw him,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI never met him.\u201d On Saturday, he said he had not meant to express doubt \u201cthat Senator Sanders participated in the civil rights movement, neither was I attempting to disparage his activism\u201d. As the presidential primary campaign shifted its focus to South Carolina, which votes on Saturday 20 February, the comment attracted attention. Sanders lost to Clinton in Iowa by a hair and beat her soundly in New Hampshire, but Clinton has a solid support base among African American voters in the south, largely built during her husband Bill Clinton\u2019s two general election wins. Sanders, whose run for president has gathered significant momentum, has nonetheless trailed Clinton in most national opinion polls. As a student at the University of Chicago, Sanders was involved in the Congress on Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), of which Lewis was chairman. Sanders was also arrested while protesting. On the campaign trail, as he seeks to answer charges from opponents that he does not understand contemporary civil rights issues, he has discussed such experiences. Lewis was a leader of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, prominently involved with the Freedom Riders of 1961, the 1963 March on Washington and Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama in 1965. In Selma, he was badly beaten by police. On Saturday, the Georgia representative issued a statement through the CBC, in which he said: \u201cIn the interest of unity, I want to clarify the statement I made at Thursday\u2019s news conference. \u201cI was responding to a reporter\u2019s question who asked me to assess Senator Sanders\u2019 civil rights record. I said that when I was leading and was at the center of pivotal actions within the civil rights movement, I did not meet Senator Bernie Sanders at any time. \u201cThe fact that I did not meet him in the movement does not mean I doubted that Senator Sanders participated in the civil rights movement, neither was I attempting to disparage his activism. Thousands sacrificed in the 1960s whose names we will never know, and I have always given honor to their contribution.\u201d Comments by prominent supporters have become a key issue in the Democratic presidential contest. On Friday, former secretary of state Madeleine Albright wrote a New York Times op-ed column in which she sought to explain remarks made at a Clinton rally in New Hampshire last week, in which she appeared to say women should vote for Clinton on grounds of gender alone. Lewis also clarified a comment made on Thursday in which he said he had known Bill and Hillary Clinton in the civil rights era. Lewis said he \u201cdid not say that I met Hillary and Bill Clinton when I was chairman of SNCC in the 1960s\u201d. He added: \u201cMy point was that when I was doing the work of civil rights, led the Voter Education Project and organized voter registration in the south in the 1970s, I did cross paths with Hillary and Bill Clinton in the field. They were working in politics, and Bill Clinton became attorney general of Arkansas in the 1970s as well. \u201cThat began a relationship with them that has lasted until today.\u201d This article was amended on Saturday 13 February 2015. The endorsement of Clinton was made by the CBC political action committee, not the CBC itself as originally stated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
