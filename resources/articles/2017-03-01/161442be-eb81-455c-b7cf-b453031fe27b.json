This is how the Guardian\u2019s print edition marked the triggering of article 50 \u2013 the process of leaving the EU after more than four decades. The Daily Mail, however, uses the banner headline \u201cFreedom\u201d to apply to both Theresa May\u2019s signing of article 50 \u2013 and the imminent release of Marine A from prison. Staying with the tabloids, the Sun \u2013 still Britain\u2019s highest-selling daily (just) \u2013 predictably goes for not one but two Brexit jokes. Its more refined stablemate opts for a classier approach with the headline \u201cThe eyes of history are watching\u201d nicely talking to the picture (of Sir Robert Walpole, Britain\u2019s first prime minister, of course). The broadsheet Telegraph uses a wider crop of the same image above May\u2019s call for the country to unite behind Brexit. The Financial Times plays it straight. That picture once more graces the fronts of the Mirror and Metro. The i goes for a cut-out-and-keep map of Europe. Bringing up the rear of the pack is the Express. And last \u2013 and quite possibly least \u2013 is the Star, which to be fair manages to ignore Brexit almost completely (save for the puff above Mel B\u2019s head) \u2013 but does find room for a Teletubbies story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
