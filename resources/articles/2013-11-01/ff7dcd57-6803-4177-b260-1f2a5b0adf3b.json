The shadow infrastructure minister spoke formally on behalf of Labour in a debate on the high speed rail (preparation) bill even though he is not a member of the shadow transport team. Adonis told peers: \"Almost every developed country with an economic geography similar to ours has over the past generation built high speed rail to link their major cities. Japan started in 1964 with Tokyo to Osaka, about the distance from London to Glasgow. \"Since then France, Italy, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, South Korea and Taiwan have followed suit. China is constructing more high speed rail than the rest of the world combined.\" and the US is building its first line from LA to San Francisco \u2013 two major cities also about the same distance apart as London and Glasgow. \"I am not aware of a single country which has introduced high speed rail between its major cities and now thinks it is a mistake. They know that high speed rail is integral to building a modern economy and a modern society. I believe it will be the same here in Britain. So we should get on with HS2.\" Labour sources said there was no significance that Adonis had opened for Labour. Lord Davies of Odham, the shadow transport minister, concluded for the party."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
