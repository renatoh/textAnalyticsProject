It\u2019s a missing girl tale set in seedy Sydney, involving A-list talent like Rachel Griffiths (of such beloved local films as Muriel\u2019s Wedding and, more recently, 2016\u2019s Hacksaw Ridge) and behind-the-scenes pedigree. The marketing material speaks of a cinematic, fast-paced \u201cgripping thriller\u201d. So why does it lack the golden glow of so much contemporary longform storytelling? Griffiths stars as Grace Gibbs, a senior detective we first meet in work-mandated anger management sessions. She is hunting a notorious cop-killer, Corey Baxter (Ian Meadows) and still feels implicated in the murder of a colleague, Lincoln, at Baxter\u2019s hands \u2013 the fallout of which included the collapse of her marriage. Grace\u2019s junior detective, Charlie Fung (Yoson An), blames her for their co-worker\u2019s death. Baxter is active again, holding-up convenience stores and terrorising the women in his life, including his ex-partner Claire (Brooke Satchwell, in perhaps the show\u2019s most sensitive performance of a woman in crisis fighting back). A shop owner (Simon Burke) is shot dead in a hold-up, leading Grace and Charlie\u2019s investigation to Bo-Lin (Xana Tang), a Chinese international student. When they find $10,000 in cash in her bedroom, it seems she is connected to some other circle of crime. Bo-Lin is now both missing and a murder suspect, and she may lead Grace and Charlie to Baxter. If the cop-killer-pursuit-meets-missing-girl procedural sounds convoluted and soapy, that\u2019s because it kind of is, and so are many of the visual storytelling and cinematography decisions made here. The show\u2019s co-creators, Ellie Beaumont and Drew Proffitt, made House Husbands, and director David Caesar has overseen episodes of everything from Water Rats to Underbelly: Razor. The problem is that criminal grit \u2013 and true cultural diversity \u2013 demands a different sensibility from House Husbands. As a deadly antagonist, Baxter isn\u2019t especially compelling, original, or realistic. The inspiration for his character, from his tatts to his tracksuits, seems to come directly from other Australian films and TV shows. The same goes for the show\u2019s hazy impression of money laundering syndicates and professional kidnappings, despite the production employing a crime consultant. The plot harvests familiar tropes from the nightly news and squeezes them into a multicultural, urban crime drama: stick-ups at 7-Elevens, sharehouses overcrowded with exploited international students, vulnerable migrants driven to gambling addictions, rote family violence. All of this unfolds recognisably across Lakemba, Malabar, Central Park\u2019s Spice Alley and the dead factories of Redfern. But without some kind of deeper abstraction, what kind of genre \u2013 a cop-show composite of mundane tabloid headlines \u2013 is that? Dead Lucky\u2019s Sydney is a shimmering architectural maquette \u2013 like an artist\u2019s impression of a new corporate development. Here, Rob Wood\u2019s production design glitters, from shots of clouds in fast-motion reflected on a monolithic skyscraper to the neon colour palette plucked from Chinatown lanterns and pokies icons. The design matters: not only is it a welcome break from crime TV\u2019s usual blue gloom but it means the characters organically come out of their garish geography, rather than the city merely serving as a decorative backdrop. Griffiths has been doing more television lately, from Barracuda (another culturally diverse SBS drama) to When We Rise (a queer activist history wrapped in a conventional teleseries format, which also aired on SBS last year). Here, her performance is as precise and controlled as ever. But thinking back to her wonderfully difficult role of Brenda in HBO\u2019s Six Feet Under, I wonder what attracted her to this new character of Grace. The conceit is clear enough: take the familiar convention of a grumpy but blazingly gifted doctor or lawyer or cop, and give the role to a woman. But Dead Lucky shows that just gender-flipping that trope isn\u2019t enough without more character depth, which might have involved stretching Grace to surprising levels of psychological intensity or moral ambiguity. Instead, the writing leans into Grace\u2019s relatability: she\u2019s a newly single mum dealing with her ex\u2019s irritating new partner; she\u2019s a tough, dynamic woman cramped by a sexist boss. And yet the very recent BBC America production Killing Eve dealt more deftly and deeply with the idea of intuitive, talented women who are hampered by male-dominated power structures. Grace is meant to be driven by her rage and sorrow for the missing, abused women for whom she\u2019s seeking justice. Indeed, the missing girl premise is an overworked plot device of crime TV in dire need of feminist revision. And yet Dead Lucky evades murky, malicious misogyny as a key theme and skips across all manner of other social issues instead: cultural rifts between generations of migrants, good old revenge and redemption, poverty-stricken sadness. This is an experienced TV team. But perhaps that\u2019s the limitation. Too schooled in the staples, rather than subverting those genres and forms, the script and its execution has similar issues to other recent crime shows such as Deep Water and Mystery Road. Freighted with seriousness, Dead Lucky is a straight cop drama rather than a truly sinister saga. There\u2019s a little too much redemption and narrative completion, and a hell-bent commitment to getting the baddies. But life \u2013 as well as other storytelling ideas at the moment \u2013 rarely feels that pat. Series like Foxtel\u2019s The Kettering Incident (which dives deep into genre, serving a mystery that is truly mysterious), Fargo (with its absurd sensibility) and Killing Eve (with its hysterically on-point motioning to the weirdest edges of human psychology) show that audiences are hungry for screen stories that truly explore the shadows. Here\u2019s hoping future iterations of Dead Lucky \u2013 if there are any \u2013 try harder to get to those outer reaches. \u2022 Dead Lucky is showing on Wednesdays at 9.30pm on SBS and is available to stream on SBS On Demand \u2022 This article was edited on 27 July 2018 to correct attribution for the show\u2019s aesthetic to production designer Rob Wood"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
