WHICH WAY THE NORTH? Where does the north begin? This question is prompted by two reflections this week on regional assemblies. The Yorkshire Post does not like them and in a leader claimed the concept had been hijacked by the Treasury and that Gordon Brown wanted to see regional parliaments as \"colonial outposts\" of his department. Not sure about that. But the YP is utterly convinced, and continued in fine thundering style: \"These devolved assemblies, stripped of any meaningful power or influence, would be little more than vassal states whose sole purpose would be to follow the commands and diktats of the chancellor.\" Meanwhile in Blackpool, Ian Duncan Smith took time off from the Tory conference to tell the BBC that a regional assembly for the north-west would add another layer of expensive bureaucracy. Which is what you would expect him to say. But putting aside the detailed arguments, you might suggest that an assembly makes a bit more sense in Yorkshire because you can see where it starts and finishes. And if you can't, some eager tyke will tell you and hurl abuse at the 1974 local government reforms which mucked the county about a bit. But the north-west is more of a problem. If you are heading north towards the more civilised western (non-Yorkshire) side of the Pennines, it's quite clear that Stoke is not in the north. It's probably in the West Midlands, but recently it hasn't been anywhere, thanks to the four-month shutdown of the railway line that serves it. Kidsgrove, despite its ski slope, is not in the north. So does that mean you hit the north when you cross the border into Cheshire? If so, Congleton must be in the north. But it doesn't feel like it; it seems more like no man's land, an anomaly, a detached parish that floats around ambivalently and could turn up in Lincolnshire next week. Macclesfield, ten miles up the road, is definitely in the north (even though local shops sell Staffordshire oatcakes), and Bollington three miles on is very much of the north. So where do you place your \"Welcome to the north\" sign? Probably at the point where you first glimpse Shutlingsloe, the Cheshire Matterhorn. It's a bit more than 1500ft. Which is half a Munro. Which sounds decently northern to me. GROGGY DOG STORY Ricky Tomlinson, the professional scouser, has been reading from his autobiography each morning on Radio 4, which has cheered up this northerner on his autumnal commute into Manchester. It's the kind of story that makes you regret that you were not brought up in a two-up, two-down terrace in Everton, played the banjo, used an outdoor lavatory with scraps of the Liverpool Echo on a nail and became familiar with the inside of lots of dodgy pubs and clubs. One of Tomlinson's characters had an alsatian as big as himself and gave his hound a half pint for every pint of bitter he drank himself. One night, on the way home from the bar, said owner met a sweet poodle and bent down to stroke it. At which point, the alsatian, as blind with jealousy as Othello, bit him on the bottom. The furious owner then socked the dog, laid it out on the pavement and harangued the hound for being ungrateful after being given free drink all night. The curious thing is that these readings have been introduced by a banjo version of Ewan McColl's Dirty Old Town. Which is about Salford. And introducing a scouser with a Salford song is like singing God Bless Our Pope in Ian Paisley's church. LOSING STREAK Blue Streak was one of those phrases that wandered in and out of the news in the fifties and sixties. It was to be the key bit of Britain's independent nuclear deterrent, the rocket that was going to deliver our missiles to anyone who might be looking for trouble. The thing was eventually abandoned after a seemingly endless political wrangle about its cost. But before it went to the scrapyard, it was developed and tested at Spadeadam near Brampton in the lonely northern part of Cumbria. Now its story is told in an exhibition at Tullie House museum and gallery in Carlisle. \"Spadeadam is of great historical importance to Britain's contribution to the cold war era and to developments in nuclear and space science,\" says the museum. \"Yet until recently, the site was closed to the public and publicly accessible material about Blue Streak remained limited. \"Some records were scattered around Britain's libraries and museums but most remained the property of the people most closely associated with the project, those who worked with it.\" The new show brings together photographs, drawings, models and a chunk of the original rockets, plus recordings of people who worked on the project. Two artists provide a contemporary comment on those strange, secret times. Tullie House MANNA FROM HEAVEN While the nation reeled at the revelation that prisoners eat better than school children, the Bishop of Carlisle has stuck his fork into the great food debate. In his diocesan newsletter, Bishop Graham Dow warns that families who do not eat together (let alone pray together) end up with diminished social skills. \"The practice of family meals is not in good shape,\" says Bishop Dow. \"Breakfast is rarely taken together as a family. Children are grabbing a bite before running for the bus or the drive to school. \"Instead of relaxed lunch breaks with colleagues and proper relaxation, a quick sandwich is eaten before returning to work.\" And as for evenings, \"The demands of watching a particular TV programme or internet chat have squeezed out the time when the family can talk together, run through the events of the day and strengthen their relationships.... \"In a healthy family, conversation flourishes at meal times. Everyone's contribution is valued. No one is put down. At meal times we learn manners and courtesy. We take an interest in each other's lives. We laugh a lot.\" And then argue about whose turn it is to do the washing up. WE RECOMMEND... Anyone who saw Michael Grandage's Edward II, Tempest and Richard III at the Crucible in Sheffield will already have grabbed tickets for A Midsummer Night's Dream. If you haven't, get on the phone now. The Guardian's Lyn Gardner said Grandage had once again proved himself \"capable of making Shakespeare seem daisy fresh\". The new Dream \"offers a wake-up call to the audience, and makes us see things about the play - and the nature of love - that we've never noticed before. Unlike Titania's blindfolded fairies, we get the whole picture.\" Lucy Bailey did a funny and inventive (although sometimes badly spoken) Dream at the Royal Exchange in Manchester last year. But her current Twelfth Night at the same place is a waterlogged disaster. Her cast sploshes around in a flooded Heartbreak Hotel, rolls in the water and drips. Why? Sheffield Theatres SPORT: RIO NOT SO GRAND A mighty meteorite hurtling towards Old Trafford could not have attracted more front page fuss than the Ferdinand saga. This week's Northerner refuses to add to the hullabaloo. AND FINALLY This is a matter of public record: it's in the Westmorland Gazette, so it must be true. It's the latest development in the conveniences saga that has been gripping south Cumbria and clogging the Gazette's pages for several months. \"A former mortuary will be converted into public toilets in Burneside to stop desperate visitors urinating in the open, if an action group has its way. \"The Burneside Loo Action Group [we are not making this up] intends to convert the old building in the grounds of St Oswald's church, currently used as a lawnmower shed, into a split ladies' and gents' toilet with disabled facilities. \"Group secretary Ian Ward said the loos were desperately needed. 'People are just doing it anywhere, behind the bus shelter, behind the present toilets that are closed, and we get wagon drivers who need the loo in the middle of the night.\" You may wonder why the group does not simply apply to reopen the existing toilets which closed 18 months ago. Life is never simple: \"[They] lost a battle to take control of the site from applicants who wanted to [create] a food kiosk selling soup, spuds and sandwiches.\" NORTHERN NEWSPAPERS This is Lancashire This is Hull News and Star (Cumbria) Liverpool Echo Newcastle Evening Chronicle This is the North East Yorkshire Post Sunderland Echo Manchester Online This is Bradford North West Evening Mail Sheffield Today icTeesside Halifax Evening Courier Huddersfield Examiner Scarborough Evening News Oldham Evening Chronicle"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
