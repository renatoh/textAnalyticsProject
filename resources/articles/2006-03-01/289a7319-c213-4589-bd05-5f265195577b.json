Elbert and Becky Higginbotham made international headlines last week when they and four family members were found stranded in Oregon's Coast Range mountains - in the process alerting Arizona authorities, who had lost trace of them. Both are wanted on charges of possessing metamphetamine and drug paraphernalia, while Mr Higginbotham is also charged with misconduct involving weapons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
