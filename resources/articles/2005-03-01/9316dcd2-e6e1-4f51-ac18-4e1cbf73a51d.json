The two companies account for about 14% of the FTSE 100's value. As such, their performances have a big influence on the direction of the market. Yesterday both were under pressure, hit by talk that a big US investment bank, rumoured to be Merrill Lynch, was trying desperately to hedge a position in ExxonMobil, the world's biggest oil firm. Exxon, which has a market value of $402bn (\u00a3209bn), closed 3.7% lower on Wednesday, unsettled by rumours that a Wall Street bank had taken on its books a large lump of Exxon stock but had been unable to place it. In order to protect itself against further losses, the bank then decided to sell short several other oil stocks, including BP and Shell. As a result, BP closed 12.5p lower at 557p, while Shell fell 10.25p to 488.75p. All of which pulled the wider market lower. Notching up its fourth consecutive session of losses, the FTSE 100 ended 34 points lower at 4,962.1, a four-week low. So far this week, the blue chip index has fallen almost 74 points. Traders said a poor performance in the mining sector, as investors decided to bank profits, added further pressure. Xstrata, 30.5p weaker at \u00a310.46, was the day's biggest faller, followed by Antofagasta, down 38p to \u00a313.32, Rio Tinto, 49p lighter at \u00a317.90, and Anglo American, 21p cheaper at \u00a312.56. The FTSE 250, meanwhile, slipped 21.6 points to 7,231.4, while the FTSE Small Cap index eased 5.2 points to 2,979. In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year gilt closed at 101.060, yielding 4.870%. Back in the equity market, Virgin Mobile was one of the main talking points. Its shares dropped 10p to 230p, unsettled by concerns of a price war. These worries were prompted by the long-awaited launch of easymobile - another enterprise in the easy empire - and an aggressive response from Carphone Warehouse , 6.25p higher at 166.5p. While the easymobile tariffs were slightly more aggressive than anticipated, analysts said it was the announcement from Carphone Warehouse of plans to slash the price charged by its Fresh mobile phone operator that really rattled Virgin. As of today, Fresh is offering customers calls from 7.5p a minute with texts at 2.5p. How big a threat it will be, however, remains to be seen. Fresh was set up at the same time as Virgin Mobile, but while Virgin has more than five million customers, Fresh has 120,000. J Sainsbury gained 3.25p to 293.5p amid rumours that a cash shell is being formed to make a bid for the company. Foam maker British Vita eased 3p to 340p after the company rejected a takeover approach of 353p a share from private equity group Texas Pacific. But traders believe there could be another bidder waiting in the wings, ready to pay 375p a share. A US rival of British Vita was the name in the frame late yesterday. Countrywide, Britain's biggest estate agent, fell 6.5p to 352p after taking advantage of its recent strong run to raise \u00a329m through a placing of 8.4m new shares at 342.5p. The proceeds will be used to fund its acquisition of the estate agency business of Bradford &amp; Bingley, off 4.75p at 315.25p. Body Shop International eased 8p to 207p unsettled by rumours, played down by sources close to the retailer, that another director was seeking to offload stock. Market professionals reckoned the fall had more to do with profit-taking - Body Shop shares have outperformed the retail sector by 21% over the last month. Sportswear company Umbro was one of the most heavily traded small cap stocks after a private equity backer reduced its stake from 57% to 33%. Using JP Morgan Cazenove, Doughty Hanson placed 35m shares with institutions at 124p, raising \u00a343m. The private equity group, which backed a management buy-in of Umbro six years ago, has agreed not to sell any more shares until September 14. Umbro shares rose 3.5p to 126p on relief that the overhang had been cleared. Proteome Science, up 3p to 57p, bounced off Wednesday's two-year low on hopes the company might soon be in a position to announce a licensing deal for its stroke markers. Game Group, the computer games retailer, eased 0.75p to 70.5p on worries that full-year results on April 19 - and specifically the outlook statement with them - will prove a disappointment. On Aim, Asia Energy rose 10p to 880p after Evolution Securities repeated its buy recommendation and \u00a315.80 target price. The move came in the wake of news that Tata, India's second biggest steel maker, wants to buy a mine to secure a supply of coal for its operations in eastern India, where output is likely to rise from 4m to 15m tonnes. Evolution analyst John McGloin says if Tata wants to buy a coking coal supply, it must have looked at Asia Energy's Phulbari site in Bangladesh. On the subject of coal mining stocks, keep an eye on Libra Natural Resources. Following a \u00a31.26m fundraising exercise, the cash shell will start trading at 3p today. Libra is looking for acquisitions in the coal sector, and a strong debut is expected. UBS note dogs Reuters Reuters was hit by profit-taking yesterday after a leading broker said the news and financial information group was unlikely to launch a \u00a31.3bn share buyback. Reuters has been a strong performer since the start of the year, rising 10% on the back of forecast beating, full-year figures and expectations that the company would sell its stake in electronic broking company Instinet, gear up its balance sheet and return \u00a31.3bn to shareholders. While the sale of Instinet is still likely to go ahead, Swiss bank UBS does not believe Reuters will return anywhere near as much money to shareholders. This is because it will look to make acquisitions in \"adjacent markets\". With UBS cutting its rating on Reuters from \"buy\" to \"hold\", the shares closed 4.5p lower at 412p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
