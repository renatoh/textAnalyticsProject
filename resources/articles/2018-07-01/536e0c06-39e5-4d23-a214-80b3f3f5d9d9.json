The British team, announced on Thursday, is missing Dina Asher-Smith, Laura Muir, Reece Prescod, Zharnel Hughes and every one of Britain\u2019s 4x100m gold medallists from last year\u2019s world championships \u2013 while a number of top Americans, including Noah Lyles, the fastest man in the world this year, are also absent. China and Germany will field weakened teams. However, UK Athletics\u2019 chief executive, Niels de Vos, denied those attending the two-day event, which takes place on the same weekend as the World Cup final and Wimbledon singles finals, would be short-changed as a result. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t concern me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe always knew that a couple of athletes wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because they had signed contracts for Diamond League events. But the overall quality is going to be astonishing. Of the six teams that have been announced, there is 113 current Olympic or world medallists and 23 world or Olympic champions.\u201d Insiders have also told the Guardian that UK Athletics is struggling to fill the 50,000-seat Queen Elizabeth Stadium four times in eight days \u2013 first for the Athletics World Cup and then the Anniversary Games. Sources have also suggested that UKA needs to sell 32,000 tickets for the Athletics World Cup to break even. However, De Vos said it was \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d that ticket sales had gone sluggishly. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be Olympic standards with people hanging from the rafters but it\u2019s pushing 30,000 for the Saturday and a little less on the Sunday,\u201d he said. That contradicts informed Guardian sources, who say that the figure is closer to half that. Other sources also say that footwear brands were furious to only hear about the new event in the papers rather than from UKA beforehand. However De Vos insisted UK Athletics deserved credit for its \u201cbold\u201d decision. \u201cIt is frustrating when people look for the weak points rather than the fabulous points but that is the nature of the world,\u201d he added. \u201cWe would be rightly criticised if we didn\u2019t try to innovate. Will everything be spot on? No. But will the public notice? Absolutely not. They will see a fabulously well-put-on event.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
