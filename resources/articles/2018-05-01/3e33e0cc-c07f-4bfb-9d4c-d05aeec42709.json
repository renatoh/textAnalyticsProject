Chelsea are expected to sack Conte despite the Italian having made clear his intention to honour the final 12 months of his \u00a39m-a-year contract in the wake of the 1-0 victory over Manchester United in Saturday\u2019s final. That win ensured the 48-year-old has claimed major silverware in each of his seasons in charge but the relationship with the hierarchy, strained since last summer, appears fractured beyond repair. The head coach has aired his grievances, largely over recruitment policy, repeatedly over the course of a turbulent campaign and his post-match comments on Saturday, insisting he would not change and that better players were needed to pursue a more expansive brand of football, in effect equated to a \u201cback-me-or-sack-me\u201d message. His players admitted the ambiguity over Conte\u2019s future had been unsettling during a disappointing title defence, with Chelsea having ended up outside the Champions League places in fifth and 30 points behind Manchester City. \u201cCertainly we\u2019ve felt the sense of uncertainty,\u201d said Cahill, who has now claimed seven major trophies in a little over six years at the club. \u201cThat is obvious to everybody in the last few months. What I can say is that the players do not have any impact on that situation. I am sure, if I was a guessing man, that the club and manager will have spoken. Let\u2019s see. I am sure the manager will make the best decision for himself and his family. I am sure the club will make the best decision what they feel.\u201d Those sentiments were echoed by the goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who is entering the final year of his contract at the club and suggested he would know only \u201cafter the World Cup if I am a Chelsea player next year\u201d. Asked what needs to change for Chelsea to challenge for the top four again next season, Cahill added: \u201cProbably for the uncertainty to be put to bed and whatever is going to happen to happen. It\u2019s totally out of our hands. \u201cAll I can say is that it has been a great finish. Winning this trophy feels absolutely amazing. I felt that we really had to win this game to save the season and, in the end, we have won a trophy which a number of teams have not managed to do and it is very difficult to do. If the manager doesn\u2019t stay next year, then he has gone away with a Premier League and an FA cup. That is something that everyone at the club can be proud of.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
