Birubi Art breached consumer law by selling thousands of Indonesian-made items as Aboriginal art, but is unlikely to ever have to pay the fine because the company is in liquidation. In October, the federal court found that Birubi Art had \u201cmade false or misleading representations that products it sold were made in Australia and hand-painted by Australian Aboriginal persons, in breach of the Australian consumer law\u201d. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) sought a high penalty to act as a deterrent, and to signify the \u201cserious cultural harm\u201d done by fake Aboriginal art. These harms were \u201cgrave and far-reaching\u201d and involved \u201cnot just direct economic loss but a weakening of the value of the authentic products\u201d and an \u201cerosion of consumer confidence in the entire sector\u201d. Outside the court, the CEO of the Indigenous Art Code, Gabrielle Sullivan, said the judgment was \u201cpromising and it will hopefully act as a deterrent for others\u201d but \u201cit is important to acknowledge that the law has not changed\u201d. The Indigenous Art code is set up to promote and preserve ethical trading in Indigenous art. \u201cThe existing consumer law has been used to highlight misleading and deceptive conduct,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWhile the ACCC acknowledges the cultural harm caused, it must be made clear that Birubi, in liquidation, were not on trial for abuses of Indigenous cultural and intellectual property and stealing, and cultural theft.\u201d Birubi Art went into voluntary liquidation in 2017 but not before selling its assets to another company, Gifts Mate, \u201cestablished and controlled by Birubi\u2019s former director Mr [Ben] Wooster,\u201d federal court judge Melissa Parry noted in her decision. \u201cWhat\u2019s not clear is how the law deals with the fact that Gifts Mate Australia continue to sell works which are strikingly similar to the products Birubi has previously sold,\u201d Sullivan said. The Indigenous Art Code and other organisations are now calling for tougher laws to protect against misrepresentation and fake art. \u201cThere is no law in Australia that says you can\u2019t make fake art or you can\u2019t misappropriate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. All the law says is that if you are doing that you need to be up front about it,\u201d Sullivan said. Between July 2015 and November 2017, the ACCC said, Birubi sold more than 18,000 boomerangs, bullroarers, didgeridoos and message stones to retail outlets around Australia, featuring designs \u201cassociated with Australian Aboriginal art\u201d and labelled with words such as \u201cAboriginal Art\u201d, \u201cgenuine\u201d and \u201cAustralia\u201d. Up to 80% of Aboriginal souvenir products sold are fake or have not been made under a fair and transparent licensing agreement, the Australian copyright agency, the Indigenous Art Code and Arts Law said, in a joint statement following today\u2019s judgment. \u201cFake art deprives Indigenous artists of economic opportunity and demeans Indigenous cultural heritage. \u201cThese concerns cannot be overcome through the existing consumer protection laws on false and misleading representations. \u201cA new law enforced by the ACCC to prevent the sale of fake art is needed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
