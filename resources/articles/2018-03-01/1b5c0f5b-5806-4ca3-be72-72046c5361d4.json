She won the Foxhunter Chase on Pacha Du Polder, a 25-1 shot despite having won the same race last year, a horse supposedly in decline who would not like the soft ground. \u201cIt was a childhood dream,\u201d says the 22-year-old, grinning broadly as she waits for lunch in her local with other staff from Paul Nicholls\u2019s stable up the road. \u201cI was watching the racing on TV with my nan when I was a kid and I was like: \u2018I\u2019m gonna do that one day.\u2019 She said: \u2018Don\u2019t be stupid.\u2019\u201d There have been all sorts of moments when that dream could have evaporated, during Friday\u2019s race and long before it. A notably difficult one came last summer, when Tucker was close to quitting Nicholls\u2019s yard in rebellion at the limitations of her role. \u201cI didn\u2019t really get to school horses much last season so I was going to move to Ireland. I went to Gordon Elliott\u2019s for three weeks and I came back and told Paul I was going to leave. He was not happy about it at all,\u201d she says, laughing at the memory and doing a passable impression of her employer while he entertains an owner a few tables away. \u201cHe was like: \u2018You\u2019re an idiot, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to leave. I would give you rides.\u2019\u201d In the last week of her notice period, the Frome-born Tucker was persuaded to stay in Somerset. It helped that Nicholls mentioned the possibility of riding Pacha Du Polder in the Foxhunter but that seemed a distant prospect back in August and Tucker did not believe it would happen. Still, she was impressed the 10-times champion trainer was reluctant to let her go. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think I was that special but clearly he must think something of me. I\u2019m so glad I stayed. He would love to hear me say that \u2026\u201d This past winter turned into something of a rush to get Tucker qualified to ride in races, requiring two stints at the Northern Racing College in Doncaster. Five rides were found for her in point-to-points and, remarkably, they all won. The only blip was Pacha Du Polder, a beaten favourite in his prep race last month. At least that lowered expectations for Cheltenham. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone thought he was going to perform that way, considering what he was like at Doncaster. Everyone was just going: \u2018Enjoy it, enjoy it.\u2019 So I was just smiling at the crowd, taking it all in. And in the end, I really did enjoy it.\u201d Pacha Du Polder did his bit with a huge leap at the last. And then Tucker\u2019s dodgy right shoulder, having behaved itself through six other rides this winter, slipped from its moorings. It is an injury that dates from last April when Tucker was unseated in a point-to-point. She also damaged a ligament in her ankle but, being a jump jockey, she waited a fortnight before seeking treatment for that. It was six months before she got help for her shoulder. \u201cI just kept thinking I was being weak and stupid. Just carry on. But it was going out and coming back in and it was really hurting.\u201d When Tucker raised her arm to encourage Pacha Du Polder forward, her shoulder dislocated and did not reposition itself until they were across the line. \u201cNormally, I can just roll it and it goes back in. It wasn\u2019t going back in and it was really annoying me. So in the finish you can see me rolling my shoulder back but trying to stay in rhythm with the horse. \u201cI\u2019d have liked to have ridden a tidier finish but if you\u2019ve ridden with your shoulder out and you\u2019ve still won \u2026 I\u2019m very pleased with myself.\u201d An operation to fix the troublesome joint is lined up for June. Next spring, look for Pacha Du Polder and a fully fit Tucker back at Cheltenham, trying to guide the horse to his third consecutive Festival win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
