They stared extinction in the face and managed not to blink. Their journey has been arduous. Bournemouth began the 2008-09 season on minus 17 points in League Two and drew 1-1 with Gillingham at home; they began the 2015-16 season hosting Aston Villa in the Premier League. It felt surreal and it would have been natural if anyone in Bournemouth\u2019s colours found themselves wondering if they really belonged in their new elevated surroundings. What if the guard on the Premier League gravy train found something wrong with Bournemouth\u2019s ticket? Of course they paid the right fare, winning the Championship title in style in May, and they could hardly contain their excitement on one of the most momentous days in their history. The noise from the stands was deafening at 3pm. Yet the mood was rather more sombre two hours later, Villa floored them with the sucker punch of Rudy Gestede\u2019s late winner. Bournemouth did not disgrace themselves. They dominated the first half and there were plenty of reasons to believe they can survive. There would have been even more if they had been sharper in the final third. Bournemouth scored 98 goals last season but their conviction disappeared when it mattered against Villa. Callum Wilson, Dan Gosling and Marc Pugh missed good chances before half-time. The manager, Eddie Howe saw tension in his players. Did the magnitude of the occasion affect Bournemouth? They have been thinking about the Villa game all summer and were desperate not to let anyone down. One could see it in every wayward through-ball, every well-intentioned run that ended down a blind alley, every snatched shot. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest job to do in football, to actually have that final moment, that final pass, that final shot,\u201d Howe said. \u201cWe were at times a little rushed. I think that\u2019s an eagerness to do well and impress rather than the stage of the season.\u201d When the wait for a seat at the top table has lasted for such a long time, there is always a danger of spilling a glass of red wine over one\u2019s expensive white shirt in a self-conscious panic when a space finally becomes available. The mind works in funny ways. Investing too much emotional energy in something makes it impossible to relax and the fear of failure, coupled with the desire for perfection, is inhibiting. Howe was asked whether the anxiety will fade once Bournemouth settle down. \u201cI certainly hope so, otherwise we are going to be in trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were free-scoring last year. The pleasing thing from my perspective is we created the chances. As long as you are getting the ball in their box and making them make decisions I think we will be fine.\u201d Villa were ruthless. Gestede soothed the irritation of Christian Benteke\u2019s departure to Liverpool. The \u00a36m signing from Blackburn Rovers came off the bench in the second half and his cannonball header from Ashley Westwood\u2019s corner in the 72nd minute ruined Bournemouth\u2019s big day. Tim Sherwood has found a rough diamond to polish up front. \u201cIt is not only his jump,\u201d Villa\u2019s manager said. \u201cIt is his accuracy as well. He throws his whole body at it and defenders invariably want to get out of the way. He is like a moving car. You don\u2019t mind standing in front of a parked one but you want to move out the way when it is coming at 30mph. \u201cHe really throws his body at it. He is brave as a lion but he is more than a battering ram. His holding play is good, his movement is good. He knows his limitations \u2013 he wants to move the ball wide and get in the box. If they deliver crosses, like with Westwood, he will eat it up. \u201cHe is a good lad with a great mentality. I did a lot of due diligence, spoke to a lot of people who have played with him or coached him. They all said he has a great work ethic and wants to learn. Craig Bellamy was the one I spoke to most. He had him at Cardiff and he was very complimentary about him.\u201d While Villa gave debuts to six players, Joshua King was the only one of Bournemouth\u2019s new signings who started. Max Gradel also came on in the second half but otherwise Howe kept faith with last season\u2019s team. Bournemouth did not have much Premier League experience. Howe will not hesitate to bring in more players before the transfer window shuts. He has funds available and Bournemouth are interested in the Crystal Palace striker, Glenn Murray. \u201cI\u2019ve had no problem doing what\u2019s best for the team in the past,\u201d Howe said. \u201cI will always make those tough decisions if it\u2019s the right thing for the club to do going forward. It\u2019s all about making sure you get a harmonious group performing to the best of its ability. That challenge doesn\u2019t disappear whatever league you are in. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough league. If you don\u2019t take your chances you are going to be vulnerable to losing games. The margins between success and failure were small in the Championship. I think they are even smaller here.\u201d Howe is resolute in his belief that Bournemouth\u2019s pure football will win them matches as well as admirers. \u201cI think our style of football can be successful in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cSides that have gone up previously have demonstrated that. We\u2019ll endeavour to make it work. We are not going to veer from our principles. We just have to make sure we perform better in the key areas.\u201d Bournemouth visit Liverpool on 17 August. Anfield would be a good place to start. Man of the match Rudy Gestede (Aston Villa)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
