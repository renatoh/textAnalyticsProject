In Lisbon, said the Sun, he attended \"a sordid last supper for Britain as an independent sovereign state\" - hysterical language even from a newspaper with a history of exaggerating the implications of European Union membership. This sort of talk leaves no room for discussion of the treaty - only that it should not be passed, which is why the paper, like the Conservative party, now wants a referendum. The strange thing is that such calls for a popular vote come from groups that also claim to be the greatest defenders of Westminster's sovereignty. This makes no sense. One might think that supporters of the supremacy of the House of Commons would be keen for it to take the final decision on the matter, as constitutional precedent shows it should. So why are they looking for another route? The reason is obvious. Westminster contains a majority of MPs who will back the new treaty - just as they backed entry to Europe in 1973, the Single European Act and then Maastricht later on. This unhappy reality leaves opponents of the treaty promising to save parliament from the consequences of its own folly by ignoring its view. But if its members are so unwise and unrepresentative of their country on this important matter, should they be trusted to take decisions on any other? Is it right that a parliament that cannot be relied upon to examine a treaty adjusting the operation of an international organisation of which Britain has long been a member should take the final decision on momentous issues such as war, or major domestic questions, such as identity cards? There is certainly much wrong with the way parliament works and the way that it is elected. That is why it needs reform. A referendum, which will diminish representative democracy, is no way to achieve it. Opponents of the treaty can say that Europe is different - which it is - and that the government promised a referendum before the last election - which it did. That was a mistake, forced out of a weak Tony Blair. It certainly makes Mr Brown's position uncomfortable now. But it does not get away from the fact that the treaty's critics intend to bypass parliament. The prime minister can respond by saying that the new treaty is not the old constitution. He should certainly be saying loudly why he thinks the treaty is necessary. But above all else he should hold his nerve on the referendum. If opponents think the parliamentary process is flawed they should be campaigning for a better, tougher, independent parliament - not trying to short-circuit it, something they so often accuse Labour of doing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
