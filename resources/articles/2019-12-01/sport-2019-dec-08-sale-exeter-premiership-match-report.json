In front of the watching national head coach, Eddie Jones, the visitors had to dig deep in the second half but weathered a strong Sale comeback to collect their third win in three outings in Pool Two and stay firmly in control of their own destiny. It was a far tighter contest than had seemed likely when Exeter led 22-8 after 26 one-sided minutes, with Sale\u2019s director of rugby, Steve Diamond, suggesting his side had been slightly unlucky not to gain further reward from the match officials in the final quarter with the Chiefs under serious set-piece pressure in their own 22. \u201cWe eventually scored but it could have been 10 minutes earlier,\u201d lamented Diamond, suggesting a penalty try could have been awarded when a driven Sale lineout was killed close to the line. The Chiefs did finish with 14 men after Ben Moon was sin-binned following a series of scrum collapses but, while Diamond acknowledged the visitors \u201cprobably just deserved to edge it\u201d, he could not resist a post-match quip on the subject of the match officials. \u201cI just said to the referee: \u2018Good game and your touch judge has had a brilliant game.\u2019 Hopefully that\u2019ll go through to their assessors and we\u2019ll never see the bastards again in Manchester.\u201d He was quick to stress he was only joking, though his blunt sense of humour can occasionally get lost in translation. His counterpart, Rob Baxter, was simply relieved to have survived \u2013 \u201cThe last 10 minutes were the longest of my life\u201a\u201d \u2013 after Jono Ross\u2019s converted 75th-minute try had set up a grandstand finish in front of a baying home crowd. Exeter were far from perfect but, in their lavender kit, they are a mob who take some flooring these days. It also helps to have a quality athlete like Stuart Hogg, even if the Scot did not last beyond the first quarter here. In his brief stay the full-back created one eye-catching try and scored another inside two minutes to give his team a handy cushion on a chilly north-west afternoon. At his best he has an eye for a gap and a turn of pace that few possess and both were on display as he sliced his way out of his own half past a succession of would-be tacklers in the direction of the Sale goalposts. He was collared just short by Tom Curry but the French referee, Mathieu Raynal, adjudged the England flanker had deliberately killed the ensuing ruck on the line and, on this occasion, awarded a penalty try. With Sale still coming to terms with losing Curry for 10 minutes, the Chiefs struck again after a sliced box kick by Faf de Klerk fell into the arms of Jack Nowell. The wing slipped the ball inside to Henry Slade who smartly released Hogg and, following a chip ahead, the recent signing was always going to beat Ross to score. He rose groggily to his feet, however, and did not reappear following a head injury assessment. A penalty from Joe Simmonds extended the margin to 15-3 but Sale, to their credit, did not fold. If there was an element of good fortune about their first try, which came courtesy of a charged down Nic White kick which rebounded off Jonny Hill\u2019s lower leg to the lurking Akker van der Merwe, it was reward for their muscular endeavour. Even the busy Van der Merwe, however, had his hands full opposite the outstanding Luke Cowan-Dickie. The England hooker\u2019s work-rate was remarkable even by his own high standards and, with Exeter sniffing a trademark score from a lineout drive, he crashed unstoppably over to register his side\u2019s third try in the opening 25 minutes. Still Sale refused to lie down. They came close to scoring the best try of the day only for the ball to slip from Marland Yarde\u2019s grasp as he rolled over the line and Van der Merwe\u2019s second try, courtesy of an Exeter-style driven lineout, reduced the half-time margin to 22-13. A couple of avoidable misjudgments, including a penalty kick to the corner by Slade which sailed dead, kept the contest alive into the final quarter, however, and a reversed penalty, awarded for a slightly late challenge by Alec Hepburn on Rob du Preez, maintained the suspense. The durable Chiefs, though, were not to be denied.
