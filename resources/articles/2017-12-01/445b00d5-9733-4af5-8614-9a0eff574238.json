The row began just before Christmas, when the magazine posted a series of videos in which editors and writers held up glasses of champagne and suggested satirical New Year resolutions for Clinton, Trump, the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, and economic adviser Gary Cohn. The clip aimed at Clinton urged, among other things, that she should stop blaming others for her loss in the 2016 presidential race; that she should teach yoga breathing classes; and that she should embrace knitting over any political ambition. \u201cTake up a new hobby in the New Year: volunteer work, knitting, improv comedy \u2013 literally anything that will keep you from running again,\u201d the writer Maya Kosoff suggested. Former Clinton aides, writers and celebrities were among those who tweeted their outrage, even after Vanity Fair put out a statement of regret, four days after the item was published. \u201cSo Vanity Fair decided that the best way to end 2017 was to take a repulsive cheap shot at Hillary Clinton, one of the most accomplished women in the history of the United States,\u201d wrote Peter Daou, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Clinton and John Kerry. Adam Parkhomenko, a former Clinton adviser, tweeted an image of a copy of Vanity Fair burning on an open fire and urged readers to cancel their subscriptions. The actor Patricia Arquette tweeted: \u201cStop telling women what the f-ck they should do or can do.\u201d The website Dictionary.com tweeted that telling a woman with a law degree \u2013 such as Clinton \u2013 to take up knitting was the definition of sexism. Even the Washington Post weighed in, with an opinion piece calling the videos snotty, condescending, demeaning and snarky. The six youthful staffers who posted the video on Vanity Fair\u2019s online political and business vertical, The Hive, were \u201cyoung urbanites\u201d, the paper said. After Twitter users started identifying the group, Kosoff reportedly tweeted: \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate being taken out of context to make me seem super sexist.\u201d The tweet could not be confirmed, however, as her account had been made private. Speaking to the Guardian on Thursday, Daou said he was not interested in criticising the individual journalists involved so much as the publication as a whole, which he accused of perpetuating gender bias against Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s an institutional issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an extension of the mainstream US media using a double standard in the way they\u2019ve treated Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s repugnant.\u201d He called for Vanity Fair to apologize fully and take down the video. Later on Thursday morning, from a golf course he owns near his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, the president weighed in with a peculiar tweet. \u201cVanity Fair, which looks like it is on its last legs, is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit they took at Crooked H[illary],\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cAnna Wintour, who was all set to be Amb[assador] to Court of St James\u2019s &amp; a big fundraiser for CH [Crooked Hillary], is beside herself in grief &amp; begging for forgiveness!\u201d The tweet appeared to allude to reports that New York-based magazine editor Wintour aspired to be US ambassador to the UK under a Clinton administration. Wintour is, however, editor-in-chief of Vogue, another magazine owned by publisher Cond\u00e9 Nast. Since 2013 she has also been artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast. Vanity Fair has just appointed former New York Times journalist Radhika Jones to replace longtime editor Graydon Carter. In one of the other videos, Kosoff recommended Sanders quit her day job and \u201ctake up food Instagram as a hobby\u201d, posting pictures of \u201cthe baked goods you so love making\u201d. The line was a reference to reports at Thanksgiving that questioned whether a chocolate pecan pie Sanders tweeted about really came out of her oven. In the video aimed at Trump, Hive editor Jon Kelly suggested the president get a new haircut. \u201cThe easiest way to not look crazy is to stop having a crazy haircut,\u201d he said, raising a glass. In its statement, Vanity Fair said the videos were \u201can attempt at humor and we regret that it missed the mark\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
