The first survey was launched right at the start of the downturn and has tracked trends in charity actions, fears and expectations since. It always generates interesting results and insights, such as the projected loss of \u00a33.2bn in rising costs and lost income in the first survey, to last year's estimate that charities stood to lose \u00a31.2bn in statutory funding in the coming year. But we're expecting this year's to be one of the most interesting yet. Why? We have long said that the recession will have a delayed impact on the charity sector, and I think most would agree that we are now feeling the full force of the downturn. The comprehensive spending review (CSR), which announced cuts of \u00a381bn from public finances, took place almost exactly a year ago. The past 12 months have been filled with uncertainty and difficulty as the effect of these cuts has reached the charity front line. We all knew the cuts were coming, but for charities the issue was not if they would bite but when \u2013 and what they would lose. Unlike many others facing the cuts, for charities, how they were implemented proved to be as great a challenge. Charity finance professionals have reported to us the huge problems their organisations have experienced as a result of individual local authorities' approaches to implementation of the CSR. For many charities, the fear that local authorities would turn off the easiest taps \u2013 the non-statutory spend to charities \u2013 came true, with spend in the voluntary sector being highly vulnerable to local authority cost-saving measures. Our members have reported abrupt ends to valuable projects near completion, the withdrawal of valued, long-established services, poor communication from those holding the purse strings about the future of their funding (negatively impacting on their ability to plan) and also demands \u2013 in my opinion some truly absurd ones \u2013 aimed at driving down costs. In this MIAD survey, we're hoping to get some hard figures from the data about just how tough things are \u2013 an insight into the prospects for localism in practice. This year's survey will also be particularly interesting given the wider economic uncertainty. History is not repeating itself \u2013 during the last recession, in the 1990s, things were starting to look up after thirteen quarters. We're past that point and rather than steadily yet tentatively recovering, the economy is still looking very strained. A second round of quantitative easing has just been announced, and every day the newspapers are filled with fears of a looming double-dip recession. Even the most informed of economists does not have a crystal ball and cannot tell us with any certainty where the economy will go. We want to use our unique position to hear how charities across this diverse sector feel, their chances of survival, their experiences from the front line and how they're coping with these changes and with the uncertainty. MIAD's Anxiety Index tracks the changes in various income streams and charities' expectations for these. So far, these have broadly followed the pattern of the recession. Corporate donations faltered two years ago following the private sector-led downturn, and it's no surprise that in last year's survey statutory funding attracted the highest levels of anxiety. The charity sector has survived wars, economic crisis and an ever-changing social and operating environment \u2013 adapting innovatively to ensure beneficiaries continue to be served. The big society agenda claims a greater role for the sector, but what is the real impact of government policies? MIAD can paint the picture of what is happening at the coal face. This year we have massively streamlined the survey (it is possible to zip through it in 10 minutes) and made it much easier to complete. The more responses we get, the better the picture we have of the situation and the better we can help support charities. The data is only as good as the level of participation \u2013 we urge all charities to take part.
