Baby Boomers? Gen Z? Let's stop with these nonsense buzzwords", "bodyText": "I suppose one needs to acknowledge that generational identity isn\u2019t exactly new. In the age of identity politics, though, where membership criteria are crucial and exclusionary lines are drawn, capital-G Generation has taken on a new shape and form. And there\u2019s been an obsessive attention to these birth-year categories as well. Generation Z. X. Millennials. Baby Boomers. If you follow any sort of media, you can\u2019t go a week without hearing someone criticize or praise one of these \u201cgenerations\u201d. I won\u2019t dignify any of them by listing what people say comprise their characteristics, because they\u2019re all depressing bullshit. I\u2019ll give you at least three reasons why: One: they\u2019re really about social class. Each generation supposedly comprises a group of age-range related people with shared experiences and interests. But tease apart any of them and you\u2019ll see age has nothing to do with what\u2019s being described. Young people are more invested in the environment than old? Please. Baby Boomers are making it tough for younger people to get by? Yeah, the problem here is home ownership (just wait until they die and pass along their mortgage-free houses to their kids!) as if there aren\u2019t plenty of poor and exploited Boomers. Peel back the onion of each and every presumed characteristic or shared concern of a generation and you\u2019ll find a class-based characteristic or concern. The young are fundamentally different in worldview than the old? As a 2015 survey suggested, \u201cMillennials are just about as racist as their parents.\u201d The imaginary characteristics of a given \u201cgeneration\u201d disappear once crucial factors like race and class are accounted for. Two: how is Gen X different than Z? It\u2019s really a marketing gimmick. Late Capitalism loves to do this, as Bill Hicks perfectly described, segmenting consumers into identities they can then sell to and persuade. \u201cGen Z has finally snapped over climate change and financial inequality,\u201d a recent New York Times article excitedly proclaimed. How\u2019d they snap? By purchasing \u201cOK Boomer\u201d merch to express their condescending disdain! Whereas in the past, perhaps \u201cmy generation\u201d was a youthful way to express a set of ideas or a political stance, \u201cgeneration\u201d now is about differences and, indeed, antagonistic if not competitive opposition between. (Guess what Gen Z, money wins!) Three: what an awful way to do any serious social or cultural analysis. Imagine focusing on the differences between 20- and 30-year-olds in the late 1400s. Or how about during the American Revolution? We live in a \u201clarger moment\u201d ourselves here. To reject the category of \u201cgeneration\u201d isn\u2019t to deny or overlook that some age groups have experienced events in ways younger or older ones haven\u2019t. School shootings come to mind. But to suggest those events prove to be defining characteristics of one group \u2013 and often one group alone \u2013 is, well, extraordinarily limited if not just sloppy thinking. All three of these aspects of generation identities destroy solidarity. We\u2019re in this social and political moment together, regardless of your age. So, let\u2019s please end this ridiculous focus on generations? Crass behavior and self-interest can be found in any age. Same with collaboration and empathy. I sometimes like to think we\u2019re collectively living in the era of a new Enlightenment and not on the cusp of a quick return to the Gilded Age. But in either case, we\u2019re only going to rise above this moment or continue to perish together. It may be obvious, but we need to build shared lines and work towards our common interests without attention to age. The only generation we should be worried about is the one that accounts for all the living and will be.
