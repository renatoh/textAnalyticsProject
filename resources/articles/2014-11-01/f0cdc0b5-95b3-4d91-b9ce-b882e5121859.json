That presence has continued to grow thanks to travelling troubadours Alessandro Del Piero and David Villa, and will grow further with Western Sydney Wanderers participation in FIFA\u2019s \u201cworld cup for clubs\u201d next month in Morocco. While not yet enjoying an identity to match USA\u2019s MLS or even Japan\u2019s J-League, development in relative terms is fast. The past weekend featured a season-high attendance for Perth (12,166), while Sydney\u2019s \u201cBig Blue\u201d attendance of 21,242 helped the Sky Blues to its biggest cumulative total after four matches. They are relatively modest figures in comparison to recent weeks, but currently the A-League crowd average of 16,347 has the local competition sitting as the 14th best attended football competition in the world, on par with Japan and ahead of the likes of Turkey, Portugal, Russia, Scotland and South Korea. Three weeks back, admittedly following a number of marquee games, the A-League average of 19,500 was ahead of France and the US. A fairly remarkable achievement for a ten-year competition in a nation where various other sports fight for spectators and invariably hog the headlines. A champion rebound No club was under more pressure this weekend than Brisbane Roar. Winners of three of the past A-League crowns, the Roar have frequently been held up as the competition\u2019s on-field role-models and with good reason. Certainly A-League historians will one day reflect on the Roar as not only being the dominant side of this era, but the club who changed the discussion about the league\u2019s playing style. However football is a game with a short memory. The Roar started the season with four successive defeats. Never before in the nearly 40 years of Australia national competition has a reigning champion opened their title defence with more than a single loss. All the more kudos then to Roar coach Mike Mulvey for sticking with a slavish Postecoglou-esque adherence to his preferred methodology. The reality is that Roar, despite having an inferior squad to last season, are still an excellent side. Yet almost without exception, the rest of the league have improved. That Mulvey managed to keep his side unified and focussed for their 4-0 rout of Newcastle Jets was as much about man-management as it was about football. With a major hurdle now successfully negotiated expect the Roar to soar. Will the Asian champions make the A-League cut Western Sydney Wanderers face yet another massive test of character and will if they are to make the finals for a third season in succession. Failure would make for a curious set of circumstances for the reigning Asian champions. Sydney FC fans, of course, will argue that the Wanderers are not even the best team in their own city, let alone the country or continent. And regardless of the noises coming out of Tony Popovic\u2019s camp, the recent Asian campaign must have been a significant distraction both physically and mentally. Soon the Wanderers will head to Morocco for the Club World Cup, and a much-mooted possible meeting with Real Madrid. Popovic omitted \u2013 rested according to some reports \u2013 his best players for their Saturday night visit to Perth Glory. Captain Nikolai Topor-Stanley, goalkeeper Ante Covic and key players Tom Juric, Matthew Spiranovic and Iacopo La Rocca were all left off the teamsheet. With little creativity in attack the Wanderers rarely looked likely to claim three points in Perth. Including the pre-season period the Wanderers have, bizarrely, lost all four A-League games and suffered an embarrassing elimination from the FFA Cup by Adelaide City\u2019s part-timers, yet overcome three of Asia\u2019s elite clubs to achieve worldwide headlines. Finally headline-writers can use Glory in a positive manner \u201cThere\u2019s a hell of a lot of improvement (left to make). Which is scary really,\u201d said Perth Glory coach Kenny Lowe last week. At the start of the season most wrote off the Glory and their unfashionable north-east England raised Lowe. No stylish knitwear, Germanic glasses or frequent, if unnecessary, dropping of the latest football jargon for the pragmatic Lowe. The proof, however, as they say, is in the pudding. It has been a big week for Perth, arguably the A-League\u2019s most underachieving club, despite their many achievements in a few short years when they were the NSL neutrals\u2019 favourites. They moved top of the ladder last weekend, and held that status this weekend with a confident 2-1 win over Western Sydney Wanderers in front of their biggest home crowd of the season. In the interim they won through to the maiden FFA Cup final. The word \u201ctoxic\u201d and Perth Glory have frequently been used in the same sentence over the past few years. Not so in the past few weeks. Things seemed to have changed in the west, and if their key personnel stay fit the Glory will surely feature in this season\u2019s semi-finals. Hardened Mariners The in-fashion Western Sydney Wanderers seemingly have had a mortgage on the word \u2018resilience\u2019, but it is a word that could equally belong on the crest of Central Coast Mariners. Four straight defeats meant the league\u2019s smallest club went into the weekend match against Melbourne City under more pressure than they have been since the Lawrie McKinna era, or possibly throughout the entire nine-year history. In truth they barely deserved a share of the spoils in Melbourne, but John Hutchinson\u2019s last-second equaliser will likely be a watershed for the club\u2019s campaign, much like the Roar\u2019s Friday night win in Newcastle will for the champions. On Sunday the Mariners started with just two players from their A-League championship win just 18 months ago. As the Wanderers proved in Asia, character and esprit de corps is a money-can\u2019t-buy asset. The Mariners have that in spades."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
