While jazz seeps slowly back into the mainstream, Muldrow\u2019s esoteric experimentations refuse to sit on-trend. It makes sense for Muldrow, then, that after the release of perhaps her most accessible album ever \u2013 the R&amp;B opus Overload, on Flying Lotus\u2019s label Brainfeeder last year \u2013 she\u2019s returned to her comfort zone (which is often firmly outside of the listener\u2019s). Vweto II is a record of celestial instrumentals, forgoing her old-soul R&amp;B vocal to instead focus on slow-burning, bass-driven hip-hop and G-funk-inspired synth noodling (see especially: Nate Dogg\u2019s Eulogy). Darkness simmers beneath, as on the menacingly low-riding Emo Blues, but for the most part, the record hits like sunshine on your face. Sprawling like a jam session, the record contains a kaleidoscopic blur of 1970s and 90s sonic references, through a 2050 filter. Across its 16 tracks, Muldrow deftly weaves the digital with the physical: on Old School Fonk, squelchy bass faces off with feathery, ASMR melodies; Big Mama Africa Jam is a pure sci-fi odyssey, and the uplifting single Brokenfolks provides a marching beat that strides confidently straight into futurist psychedia. Vweto II sits firmly outside of what\u2019s trending: if you\u2019re looking for a way to escape the present moment, it\u2019s the perfect time warp to get lost inside."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
