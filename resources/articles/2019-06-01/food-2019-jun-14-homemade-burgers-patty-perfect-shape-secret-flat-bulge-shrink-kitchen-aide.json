How do I keep them nice and wide, and thin? Nick, London Burgers are the bane of my life, too, Nick, but for very different reasons. Namely, two teenagers with \u2013 the horror! \u2013 Deliveroo and Five Guys addictions. But I digress: your homemade burgers do this because the proteins in the meat contract when exposed to heat. This expels moisture from the burger, especially from its edges, which in turn makes the patty swell up in the centre; it can also increase the cooking time, which is why burgers end up with thin, overcooked sides and a fat, underdone centre. Many home cooks mistakenly try to counter this by pressing the middle back down when it rises up like a meaty molehill, but that only pushes more of those glorious juices out into the pan, where they just sizzle and evaporate, so forfeiting more flavour; over-handling a burger also threatens its structure, and runs the risk of leaving you with a grim-looking pile of mince, rather than a lush meat patty. According to Samantha Evans of Hangfire Southern Kitchen in Barry, South Wales, by far the best solution is to use one tool we always have close to hand: your thumb. \u201cPush a big dimple into the centre of the patty with your thumb,\u201d she says. \u201cThe divot \u2018reinflates\u2019 as the meat contracts, so you end up with a patty that\u2019s an even thickness and cooked uniformly throughout.\u201d Evans cooks her burgers on a custom-built wood-fired asado grill, which aren\u2019t exactly ten-a-penny, but the same principle applies to a barbecue, griddle or frying pan, too. An added benefit of a burger that\u2019s the same depth all over is that it gives the toppings a flat platform to sit on, so they\u2019re less likely to slide off and wind up in your lap. Tom Barton of Honest Burgers, which earlier this week opened its 33rd site in the UK, says that when a burger changes shape in this way during cooking, \u201cIt usually means the meat\u2019s been over-minced or over-cooked.\u201d Supermarket mince, for example, may have been put through an industrial mincer three or four times, to ensure an even consistency, but such texture-free pap isn\u2019t conducive to a decent burger. \u201cIt\u2019s overworked and rubbery,\u201d Barton says, \u201cand it contracts alarmingly when cooked.\u201d To that end, he recommends smiling sweetly at a butcher and asking them to mince your beef from scratch: \u201cOnce only, on a 5mm plate, ideally.\u201d Alternatively, he says, chop it by hand with a very sharp, heavy knife. \u201cYou\u2019re not after mince as such,\u201d he says, \u201cbut a steak tartare consistency\u201d, adding that it needs at least 20% fat content for the patty to bind together: \u201cIt has a softer, more delicate texture.\u201d It\u2019s a bit like using a press or a knife on garlic: when you push it through a press, you end up with wet, mushy paste, but chopped, it\u2019s dry and still has texture. Charlie Carroll of mini steakhouse chain Flat Iron, meanwhile, advises much more drastic action, especially at home. \u201cThese days,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s all about smashed burgers for me.\u201d The process couldn\u2019t be easier, even if it does seem a little counter-intuitive, given that we know it\u2019s best to leave a burger well alone while it\u2019s cooking. \u201cRoll the patty into a ball, season one side, then lay it seasoned side down in a hot, lightly oiled skillet.\u201d Using an oiled spatula (a cranked one with a kink in the handle is ideal; failing that, the oiled base of a clean pan will do), squash it down into a 1cm-thick patty. \u201cHold it in place with the spatula [or pan] for another 30 seconds, lift off the spatula and leave the burger to cook for 60 seconds more. Season the top, flip over [now\u2019s the moment to pop that slice of cheese on top, by the way] and cook for 30-45 seconds on the other side. That\u2019s it. Done.\u201d \u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
