Such services do exist. Play around on Google and you will find no shortage of websites that allow people to advertise properties for free, or for a small fee. Yet for some reason, these private sale websites have never really taken off. None of them has a fraction of the clout of Rightmove, Britain's biggest property website, which is owned by four of the biggest estate agency chains and which sellers are not allowed to access directly. Yet the internet has transformed the way we buy and sell everything from music to plane tickets to groceries, so surely it cannot be long before someone manages to find a way to topple estate agents from their dominant position? \"It is frustrating that more people don't think beyond using an estate agent,\" says Keith Davis, who runs Property Broker (propertybroker.co.uk), one of the more well-regarded private sale websites. He believes many people are intimidated by estate agents and fall for their patter. However, there are signs that some established sites are beginning to build up a head of steam. HouseWeb (houseweb.co.uk), another of the better-known sites, says it is having its best year ever, racking up around 2.5m page \"hits\" a month, while Property Broker, which focuses on London and the Home Counties, now sells about \u00a380m worth of property a month and claims that last year, in parts of south-east London, it was selling 20% of all properties coming on to the market. Meanwhile, the past few weeks have seen the launch of two new private sale sites, Eureka247.com and MonkeyMove.com. After recent publicity, Eureka247 this week claimed it was receiving \"over 2,000 visitors a minute\". So there is clearly an appetite for the concept. As house prices have soared, so have estate agent fees. Countrywide, Britain's biggest estate agency group, said a few weeks ago that the average commission paid by a seller had risen by \u00a3338 in a year to \u00a33,156. And then there is the profession's terrible public image. Estate agents are consistently ranked below politicians and journalists in the trustworthiness stakes, and the recent BBC1 fly-on-the-wall documentary Whistleblower will have done nothing to improve their public standing. Against that backdrop, going it alone over the internet seems like a bit of a no-brainer. There are dozens of private sale property websites, some national, some regional. There is often a one-off fee which can range from a few pounds to several hundred, though a number are free. The best sites have databases of house-hunters who are automatically emailed details of a property if it meets their requirements. Pretty much all the websites allow photos, while a few, such as HouseWeb, even offer a \"virtual tour\" of the property. Most of the bigger ones will provide a For Sale board to stick outside your house, though you will often have to pay extra for this, while some, such as The Little House Company (thelittlehousecompany.co.uk) will give you listings on other property portals such as propertyfinder.com and fish4homes.co.uk. One of the first things you should probably do before signing up with a site is see how many properties they have for sale in your area. If they have little or nothing, this is probably because they have few sellers or buyers and any fee won't be worth paying. Many people double their chances by using an estate agent and advertising online as well. But a word of warning: some private sales websites claim that if you sell your house as a result of an enquiry that came via them, you do not need to pay the estate agent a commission, even if you have a sole agency agreement, because they are publishers and not estate agents. But in December, the Office of Fair Trading said that \"providing clients with a For Sale board and/or putting it up outside their property, particularly where the board contains the property retailer's contact details\", and \"receiving and fielding queries from potential sellers or buyers and passing on details to their clients\", were likely to fall within the definition of estate agency work. So you could risk having to pay two sets of fees if you have a sole agency agreement and end up selling privately via one of the websites. But what about buyers? Which of the private sale sites are worth a look? We decided to put nine of them to the test. I am gearing up for a move, so I logged on to see what they had. I'll be looking for a three/four-bedroom house in Walthamstow, east London. I keyed in my requirements and the results are shown below. Property Broker had the most houses - six, including one in precisely the right location. And the photos were good quality. HouseWeb turned up only one such house in Walthamstow, which was sold subject to contract. Estate agents, of course, don't think much of the private sale operations. The biggest risk, they say, is that you end up selling for less money than you could have got had you taken proper advice. \"There is a danger you can lose more than you gain by not using an agent,\" says Peter Bolton King, chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents. \"Also, if you are selling it privately, any Tom, Dick and Harry can just come round.\" Casy study: Natasha Wright Natasha Wright and her partner would do anything to avoid using an estate agent after being royally messed around when they bought their two-bedroom flat. The flat in north-west London was the couple's first property purchase. \"There were lots and lots of things that drove us insane,\" says Ms Wright, 24, an IT consultant. First of all, the estate agent failed to turn up for the first two meetings to show them around. \"Then the contact we had at the agency left the company and we never knew about it. We weren't told,\" she says. They ended up being \"passed around the houses\" and no one returned their calls. But that wasn't the end of their problems. \"They lied about details such as the annual upkeep costs,\" says Ms Wright. The couple later discovered the service charge was double what they were originally told. Also, the address of the flat was wrong on the documentation. \"When we made our initial offer, it took them two days to get it to the vendor. Then it was a week of constant phone calls until we heard back that the offer had been accepted. We later learned from the vendor that they had accepted the offer immediately.\" Finally, when the couple went to pick up the keys from the agent, they were handed only one set. They had to get the others from the former owner. \"They got around \u00a33,000 for doing relatively little,\" says Ms Wright. \"We are really tempted to sell privately when we do.\" They are not alone in experiencing problems. Last month, the Ombudsman for Estate Agents revealed there has been a 9% increase in complaints about estate agents. And research by insurer More Th&gt;n found that one in nine people have had a dispute with an agent over the payment of fees or commission. It says Britons \"now place estate agents in the top three least trusted professions\". More Th&gt;n offers a legal service that can help resolve disputes which is an add-on to its home insurance. r.jones@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
