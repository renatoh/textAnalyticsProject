The experiment is a bold one, but we are not without hopes that it will meet with such an amount of public support as will fully remunerate the undertakers of it (for these things, it is almost needless to say, cannot be done without large pecuniary means), and show that the musical taste of Manchester is sufficiently advanced to welcome the introduction of the higher compositions of musical art. No provincial town except Manchester, we venture to think, is in a position to make such an experiment; partly from the fact that no other town has so large a body of resident instrumental musicians but more, perhaps, from the fact that no other town possesses a resident musician of Mr. [Charles] Hall\u00e9's calibre. Thoroughly acquainted with the powers and resources of an orchestra, and with all the great instrumental works written for it, unrivalled as a pianist and with manners and bearing that attract and inspire confidence and esteem from the members of any orchestra submitted to his control, as was shown by the handsome acknowledgment made to him by the Art Treasures band, he has every qualification that could be wished for in carrying out the undertaking in which he is now engaged. We have on a previous occasion, when speaking of the present band, stated it to be identical with the Art Treasures band in point of numbers. It is, however, much superior. That band numbered 50 performers only; the present one numbers 60, the increase being in the most important element, namely, the strings. For the information of our musical readers, we give them the constitution of Mr. Hall\u00e9's band; those versed in such matters will see how admirably it is adapted for orchestral effects: the strings are 36, Viz. 20 Violins, 10 first, headed by Mr. Seymour; and 10 seconds, headed by Mr. Buck; six tenors headed by Mons. Baetens; five violoncellos, headed by M. Vieuxtemps; and five double basses headed by Mr. Waud. The 24 remaining instruments are two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two cornets, two trumpets, three trombones, ophicleide, kettle drums, bass drum and cymbals, harp, and piano forte. The effect of this band, as heard in the Free Trade Hall on Saturday evening, is very beautiful. In a room with so much resonating surface, it might have been feared that such a powerful mass of wind instruments would be felt to be too prominent; but it was not so, for both the wind and stringed instruments are in excellent hands, the former having the power of playing with the utmost delicacy, and the latter with plenty of sonorous force, so that on no occasion, even when the full force of the wind instruments was employed, did the strings ever lose their supremacy, and this is a great matter. Anyone who heard Mons. Jullien's band on Wednesday evening (and this is a comparison almost forced upon us), and Mr. Hall\u00e9's on Saturday evening, will understand the matter better than from any words we can use.
