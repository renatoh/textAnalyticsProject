The frustration of the England striker at his inability to secure a starting place with Madrid, despite having the best goals-per-minute ratio at the club, had appeared to point to an early return to the Premiership. Some reports even suggested that he had delivered an ultimatum. That can only have encouraged Newcastle, whose manager admits he is \"monitoring\" the Owen situation. \"Michael comes into the category of players who will excite the fans,\" said Souness. \"I know him well. He is a great centre-forward and is only 25 .\" But Owen yesterday claimed he had no intention of returning to play in England. \"Someone told me this morning that there were newspaper reports about Newcastle,\" he said. \"I admire Graeme Souness, and Newcastle are doing well. It's always nice for a club to be interested in you, especially one like Newcastle. But I am happy in Madrid. I like the city, I get on with my team-mates, the atmosphere is good and the fans seem to like me.\" Owen's remarks come after the Real coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo insisted that the England striker had started against Athletic Bilbao last Saturday because he \"deserved it\" and not because of \"what he said in the press\". \"I don't take the slightest bit of notice of players' interviews,\" Luxemburgo snapped, and Owen appears to have taken note. \"I never complain about anyone and I am not going to moan about the manager's decisions,\" he explained. \"I was in England with the national team and I was asked if I wanted to play more. Of course I said I did. The next day the headlines said: 'Owen demands a starting place or he's off'. That wasn't the case. \"I think the coach would be disappointed if I didn't say that I wanted to play more - it's a healthy attitude to have. The trouble is, sometimes your words get twisted, especially with me being out here. Things can get lost in translation between English and Spanish.\" Michel Salgado may be out for a month after suffering a knee ligament injury during Real's 1-0 Champions League win over Juventus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
