Delgado last played for his country six years ago and in his four singles matches to date at this level he has managed to win only one set. He was a player of considerable promise - the great British failing - as a teenager but, like so many, did not progress and there seems no sense in bringing him back at this stage of his career, even to play doubles. It would have been better to have given his place to a youngster. Spearheading the team will be Andy Murray, with Alex Bogdanovic returning to the fold, as well as Alan Mackin, although like Delgado none has ever won a live Davis Cup singles match. Arvind Parmar is dropped from the team that lost to Serbia &amp; Montenegro in Glasgow during April. Britain have chosen to play this Europe-Africa group one relegation play-off match on grass, although the decision to select Eastbourne as the venue has not gone down well with Murray, who rightly felt it did not exactly represent the cutting edge of British tennis. He will also need to find a new partner for the doubles, presumably Delgado. Bogdanovic has not played Davis Cup tennis since he lost his opening singles match against Israel in Tel Aviv last year, Britain winning that tie 3-2 with Murray making his Davis Cup debut and winning the doubles with David Sherwood. It was claimed Bogdanovic had said he did not want to play in Glasgow but he has since denied this. \"I was always available but it was Jeremy's decision whether I was ready or not. He kept telling me I was ready but then he didn't pick me,\" he said recently. Now he has, and Bogdanovic, ranked No154, has a point to prove."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
