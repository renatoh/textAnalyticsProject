Too many heavy meals, several large brandies, a few sneaky fags, plenty of afternoon naps, one unscheduled trip to Asda before a visit to the hydro-electric \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d and even the most limited of progress in EU renegotiations can feel like one giant leap for mankind. On the first day back after the Christmas break, all that David Cameron could remember of December\u2019s European Union summit was that it had been an unmitigated triumph. \u201cI\u2019ve agreed the negotiations we are having are all extremely far-reaching even if they\u2019re not particularly,\u201d the prime minister burbled, \u201cand I can report to the House that the first part of the negotiations have been negotiated. There will be some further negotiations in February that may or may not be negotiated, and if they aren\u2019t then the negotiations will be concluded at some unspecified later date. But let me assure the House that whether I manage to renegotiate the one tricky bit of my negotiations or not, the negotiations will have been successful.\u201d Dave did slip in, though, that the negotiations with his own cabinet had been rather less successful, as he has been forced to allow them a free vote in the forthcoming EU referendum. Luckily for him, nobody chose to point out that this was the least he could have done to guarantee he wouldn\u2019t have to sack himself if the electorate voted to leave. The Tory Eurosceptics were all on their best behaviour \u2013 noblesse oblige, etc \u2013 and the Labour benches were far more preoccupied with the ongoing shadow cabinet reshuffle that was well into its second day, with only one move confirmed \u2013 by ousted shadow culture secretary Mike Dugher himself rather than Labour head office, which might yet still deny it. Anyone but Hilary Benn would have been Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s choice of nextdoor neighbour on the Labour benches. So it was sod\u2019s law that the shadow foreign secretary, for the time being at least, plonked himself down next to Corbyn. Throughout proceedings, Benn smiled beatifically as if he were unaware he was the cause of the reshuffle logjam, occasionally leaning across his leader to share his jovial pens\u00e9es with Chris Bryant and Rosie Winterton, just to politely remind Corbyn who is boss. It\u2019s fair to say that neither Dave nor Jeremy are in total control of their parties right now. Corbyn did not look particularly amused, spending most of the time pretending he didn\u2019t care about being cut out of the conversation by staring intently at his phone. Perhaps he was hoping someone might text him with news of what was going on with the reshuffle. In his reply to Cameron, Corbyn was in no doubt about what was required. \u201cIf you are to achieve change,\u201d he said, with no apparent irony, \u201cyou need to make friends through patient diplomacy.\u201d Amen to that, though it wasn\u2019t a strategy that appeared to be paying dividends for him. Comic timing isn\u2019t usually Dave\u2019s strong point, but for once he landed a moderately effective pre-cooked line. \u201cNo matter how many Eagles there are,\u201d said Cameron, \u201cthe Labour party will always have an albatross at the head of the party.\u201d Angela Eagle seemed to find this funnier than anyone else in the chamber, laughing longer and louder than the joke deserved. Corbyn flushed with anger while Dave looked nonplussed; he\u2019d never received such an enthusiastic reaction to one of his gags. Even from his family. Especially from them. The closest Dave got to dissent thereafter was from Tory Eurosceptic Philip Davies, who dared to suggest the EU negotiations may not be all they have been cracked up to be. Dave was outraged. \u201cThe whole government is behind me,\u201d he insisted, \u201cwhile you carp and cavil at someone who is getting the job done.\u201d Some people just don\u2019t understand that the job to be done is to do not very much."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
