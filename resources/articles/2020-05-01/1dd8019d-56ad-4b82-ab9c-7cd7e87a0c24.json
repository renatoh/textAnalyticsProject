Australia was lobbied to make the submission to the court by Israel, which is not a party to the court. But the office of the prosecutor has rejected Australia\u2019s argument, saying it had not formally challenged Palestine\u2019s right to be a party to the court before. In December, the ICC\u2019s office of the prosecutor concluded a five-year preliminary examination of the \u201csituation in the state of Palestine\u201d, concluding there were reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes have been, or are being, committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip by members of the Israeli Defence Forces, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups, and members of the Israeli authorities. \u201cI am satisfied that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,\u201d the prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said. \u201cThere are no substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice.\u201d But prior to starting a formal investigation, the ICC prosecutor has asked the court\u2019s pre-trial chamber to rule on the scope of the court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction, essentially seeking confirmation the ICC had jurisdiction over alleged offences committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and Gaza. Palestine\u2019s accession to the ICC in 2015 as a party to the court was accepted by the UN secretary general. Australia is one of only six countries that are not directly involved to have made submissions to the court. Australia\u2019s submission, filed by Australia\u2019s ambassador to the Netherlands, Matthew Neuhaus, at The Hague, states: \u201cAustralia\u2019s position is clear: Australia does not recognise the \u2018State of Palestine\u2019. \u201cAs such, Australia does not recognise the right of the Palestinians to accede to the Rome Statute\u201d (the treaty which established the ICC \u2013 to investigate the crimes of genocide, aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity \u2013 in 2002). Australia argues Palestine\u2019s accession to the Rome Statute in 2015 did not make it a state, and that the UN secretary general\u2019s acceptance of that accession is an \u201cadministrative act that does not confer a particular status, including statehood\u201d. Australia\u2019s position is that a two-state solution must be advanced through direct negotiations between the parties and that the question of Palestinian statehood cannot be resolved before a negotiated peace settlement. In Senate estimates, James Larsen, the chief legal officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said that Israel had \u201cencouraged us [Australia] to make observations\u201d to the court regarding the investigation into war crimes in Palestine. \u201cIsrael certainly made representations to the Australian government, including myself, but others as well.\u201d Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told his cabinet in February friendly countries had responded to Israeli lobbying over the case. He labelled the ICC \u201ca political instrument in the war against Israel\u201d, and said \u201cI would like to commend Germany, Australia, Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Uganda, which have joined the US in a steadfast stand alongside Israel.\u201d Israel is not a party to the ICC. The ICC\u2019s pre-trial chamber is expected to respond on the jurisdiction question in coming weeks. Australia\u2019s position has been condemned by international law organisations and Palestinian advocacy groups. Rawan Arraf, the director of the Australian Centre for International Justice, said Australia\u2019s intervention in the court process was unprecedented. \u201cWhy is Australia going out of its way to hold back an investigation into Palestine? Australia has always been a strong supporter of accountability and the fight to end impunity. It should not stop now and it should withdraw its request.\u201d The ICC has come under sustained criticism for a perceived bias, targeting poor, weak states, while ignoring the crimes of more powerful states, and in particular, focusing almost exclusively on African states. Arraf said with the ICC at a critical juncture in its history, Australia should support the court in providing justice for all people around the world. She argued the court\u2019s investigation wasn\u2019t \u201cjust some academic exercise on questions of law\u201d but that there were real victims and ongoing abuses. George Browning, the president of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network and a retired Anglican bishop, argued Australia\u2019s intervention took its \u201cgrowing, one-sided support of Israel to a new high\u201d. \u201cBy denying Palestinians the right to justice, and protecting Israel from justice, Australia undermines the rule of law as the standard by which international behaviour is to be judged, and if necessary, sanctioned. Jewish community leaders and organisations in Australia welcomed the government\u2019s intervention in the court. The executive director of the Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council, Dr Colin Rubenstein, said Australia had demonstrated \u201cstrong moral leadership and principled support for the rule of law\u201d. \u201c[Australia\u2019s] submission not only outlines strong legal arguments preventing the Court having jurisdiction to consider the \u2018Situation in Palestine\u2019 \u2013 as the so-called \u2018State of Palestine\u2019 does not meet the necessary legal requirements for statehood under international law \u2013 but also makes the case that the court risks undermining any prospects of a negotiated peace.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
