Bruton is the subject of a column, \"Is it just us?\", written by Josh Woodfin. \"Our favourite Bruton fantasy involves us being introduced to her at a dinner party. She'd have a table of designers and politicos enraptured with her smart anecdotes, effortlessly switching topics from skirt length to multiple orgasms to . . . Guantanamo Bay. As you get your coats to leave, Jane turns, grabs your crotch and purrs, \"Let's get you home - I've got breakfast at an ungodly hour and mummy needs a back rub\".\" Is there something the new Arena editor, former Sunday Times interviewer Giles Hattersley, wants to tell us? \u00b7 Overheard: \"Good to have your boss on board.\" Members of the Downing Street press operation to Associated hacks after Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre was recruited by Gordon Brown to investigate a possible relaxation of the 30-year rule on access to government documents. The appointment is particularly interesting for Daily Mail columnist Peter Oborne who has just written a book, The Triumph of the Political Class, attacking the political elite and the close links between politicians and the media. \u00b7 Channel 4's More4 had an unfortunately flippant take on Heather Mills' ferocious attack on the media last week. \"Hopping mad,\" said the on-screen strapline as the More4 News went into an ad break. Steady on, chaps. Just because not many people are watching, it doesn't mean no one's watching. \u00b7 The forward-looking Mail on Sunday broke new ground with its plans for a special Polish supplement. The pull-out section in the paper's business and finance section will also appear online, aimed at the country's \"rapidly growing Polish community in Britain [which] has a reputation for hard work, aspiration and entrepreneurial spirit\". No word yet on whether the initiative will spread to its sister daily paper. You remember, the one in which \"hungry, knife-wielding\" Poles butcher swans in the home counties and immigrants \"overwhelm\" the NHS (\"recent data suggests up to half of all Polish men smoke\"). Perhaps Richard \"What's Polish for 'benefits'?\" Littlejohn could edit it. \u00b7 A warm welcome back to Channel 4's Property Ladder, but Monkey wonders how delighted the programme's sponsor (\"Straightforward mortgages from ING Direct!\") will have been with this trail, aired right in the middle of last week's opening show, for tonight's Dispatches. \"Bursting the bubble - Dispatches investigates the housing crisis and how it may affect your future.\" Anyway, about that loft conversion . . . \u00b7 Monkey's understatement of the year: \"There has been the occasional hiccup but British TV remains the best in the world.\" Sir Trevor McDonald, introducing the National Television Awards on ITV1. One man's hiccup is another man's multi-million pound premium rate phone-in scandal. Meanwhile Monkey hears that triple winners Ant and Dec were doing rather less well in the phone polls with a few days to go and enjoyed an 11th hour surge in voting. It surely had nothing to do with a Daily Mirror story on the day of the awards that said the pair were braced for a \"humiliation\", with a friend quoted as saying \"They won't sweep the board and may win nothing.\" They needn't have worried. \u00b7 Monkey's scheduling of the week: Long Way Down, a celebrity-led travel documentary, Sunday, 9pm, BBC2. Michael Palin's New Europe, a celebrity-led travel documentary, Sunday, 9pm, BBC1. There was obviously nothing BBC2 controller Roly Keating - acting controller of BBC1 - could have done about it. \u00b7 On page 35 of Thursday's Financial Times: an advert for a rather attractive Ducati motorbike courtesy of Auctionair, the auction company chaired by Albert Scardino, husband of Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of FT parent Pearson. Let's hope she gave him a good rate. \u00b7 \"50 things I must do before I'm 50,\" writes Daily Mail TV critic Jaci Stephen on the eve of her 49th birthday. One of them appears to have been \"be pictured in the pages of the Daily Mail, naked in the bath except for a strategically placed rubber duck and some Photoshopped bath bubbles\". It truly leaves nothing to the imagination, and marks a departure of sorts for the paper, which has traditionally tended to steer clear of its star writers stripping off. In this week's Mail: Tom Utley gets his kit off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
