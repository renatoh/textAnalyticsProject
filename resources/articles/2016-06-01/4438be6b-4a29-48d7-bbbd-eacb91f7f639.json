Alvaro Morata and Nolito each scored twice as the champions from 2008 and 2012 warmed up for their defence in style. Manchester City\u2019s David Silva and Cesc F\u00e0bregas of Chelsea were also on target in Salzburg. \u201cWe are the favourites [for Euro 2016] because we come into it having won four years ago,\u201d Del Bosque said. \u201cThere are other national teams, but it\u2019s our dream to be champions again. We\u2019re in a good moment. We have had a tough season, very intense, but we are ready to go into the Euro in the best conditions. \u201cWe are ready to start, to win is another thing. There are good rivals and in football everything is really even.\u201d Spain play Georgia in Getafe on Tuesday before beginning their Euro 2016 Group D campaign on 13 June against the Czech Republic in Toulouse. Russia, England\u2019s opening opposition in Marseilles, lost 2-1 to the Czechs in Innsbruck, Austria. Tomas Necid scored a 90th-minute winner as the Czechs came from behind. Aleksandr Kokorin\u2019s sixth-minute goal for Russia was cancelled out by Tomas Rosicky four minutes into the second half before Necid struck. Everton\u2019s Romelu Lukaku scored an 89th-minute equaliser which saved Belgium the embarrassment of defeat to Finland, who have not qualified for the championship. Belgium, who are in Group E with Italy and are one of the pre-tournament favourites, went behind to Kasper Hamalainen\u2019s goal eight minutes into the second half. Holland, who will not be playing at Euro 2016 after failing to qualify, beat Poland 2-1 in Gdansk. Newcastle\u2019s Georginio Wijnaldum got the winner for the Dutch after Artur Jedrzejczyk had cancelled out Vincent Janssen\u2019s opener. The Poles will contest Group C with Northern Ireland, Germany and Ukraine. Norway, who will not be in France either, beat Iceland 3-2. Iceland, who are in Group F with Portugal, went behind in the first minute and ultimately Gylfi Sigurdsson\u2019s 81st-minute penalty softened the scoreline for them. Elsewhere, Estonia beat Andorra 2-0 and Latvia defeated Lithuania 2-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
