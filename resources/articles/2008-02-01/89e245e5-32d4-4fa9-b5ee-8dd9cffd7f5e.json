It's not just that it's hard to emulate a closed binary blob, it's that the file formats themselves are insanely complicated. This we know because Microsoft has now published them. I recommend them highly, especially if you're an insomniac. The Word spec alone can send you to sleep in minutes. Fortunately there are men made of sterner stuff, such as Fog Creek Software's Joel Spolsky, of whom we are all fans. Joel not only understands specs, and not only knows how they came to be that way, he can spin it into a useful and entertaining story. Which he just has. Joel has an unfair advantage in that, many moons ago, he worked at Microsoft. Indeed, many readers will remember the story of the 1-2-3 date compatibility \"bug\" from one of his best ever posts (My First BillG Review), which this time he says \"is too boring to describe here\". It also gives you the chance to freshen up on Strategy Letter IV: Bloatware and the 80/20 Myth, which may be seven years old but will still be bang up to date in 2028. Will Why are the Microsoft Office file formats so complicated? still be as relevant then? I hope not, but one should never underestimate people's ability to cling to the past. * The minimum doc test involves at least one odd headline face in two or three decks, and multiple columns of justified text flowed round embedded photos with captions, all paginated (with footnotes) on letterheaded paper with a graduated background: in other words, a typical press release.
