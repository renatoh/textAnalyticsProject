Her body is impossibly twisted, as if it's broken. There's something terrifying about this nocturnal vision - it is every woman's nightmare of the dangers that streets might hold after dark - and yet Juan del Gado's photograph also feels fake. Like a latter-day Weegee, del Gado constructs crime-scene images that unsettle both through the violence they allude to and the artifice their lush colouring and theatrical lighting reveals. Each of the four artists in this exhibition themed around the night creates work that blends threat, drama, enigma and terror. Rut Blees Luxemburg's photographs show cityscapes that suggest violence: streets bathed in saffron light, traversed by streams of liquid that could be blood; a deserted road innocuous by day but menacing in the dead of night. In Christopher Stewart's work, lonely figures stand on the edge of something (the Irish border, a Finnish forest), the tension of their position heightened by the darkness that surrounds them. Sophy Rickett, meanwhile, documents nocturnal scenes - a wood, an owl in flight - in ways that make them magical. What this show captures so well is the weird beauty of night vision, the fear and wonder, a fear that never really fades. \u0095 Until September 1.
