Wenger is determined to continue and, with a two-year contract on the table, says an announcement will be made \u201cvery soon\u201d. However, supporters have become increasingly exasperated with the club\u2019s fortunes and, on Saturday, Arsenal slumped to a 3-1 defeat at West Bromwich Albion after an insipid display which drew criticism from all corners, including another withering attack from the celebrity Arsenal fan Piers Morgan. Out of the Champions League, following a 10-2 aggregate defeat by Bayern Munich, it was expected that Wenger would end his 20 years at the club with his time seemingly coming to a natural conclusion. Yet the Frenchman seems emboldened by the criticism from pundits and supporters and is focused on extending his stay, something Giroud is backing. The Arsenal striker, who has joined up with his France team-mates for the games against Luxembourg and Spain, wants the club to win the FA Cup and persevere with Wenger. He told Canal Plus: \u201cWe want Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to renew his contract, to continue his adventure, because we support him. We hope we can win the Cup and that Arsenal qualify for the Champions League.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
