Sometimes she says those exact words. Sometimes, like today, she doesn\u2019t have to. Thirty years in children\u2019s TV, first as a presenter on Play School and later as head of her own production company, has made Benjamin adept at communicating not only with children but with the inner children of adults. It\u2019s a skill that can make encounters unexpectedly emotional. \u201cCaring,\u201d she says, that\u2019s the secret. \u201cAnd meaning it. On Play School, I said, \u2018Hello, are you all right?\u2019\u201d She pauses, but maintains eye contact, and suddenly I\u2019m four again, sitting cross-legged and too close to the TV, as her benevolent face smiles out at me. \u201cI\u2019m giving the child a moment to answer back,\u201d she explains. \u201cBecause many of the children watching were living in children\u2019s homes, or weren\u2019t loved, or were being abused, and they needed somebody. I made them understand that I loved them.\u201d The feeling is plainly mutual. This Friday, Benjamin will receive the lifetime achievement prize at the Women in Film and Television awards. It is only the latest in a long list of honours that includes an OBE (2001), a special lifetime achievement Bafta (2004) and Freedom of the City of London (2018). Tom Hanks is starring in a film telling the semi-mystical story of Mister Rogers, Benjamin\u2019s US equivalent, so perhaps her own Hollywood biopic is next? \u201cYou\u2019d have to embellish it a bit,\u201d says Keith, her husband of 40 years, who occasionally chips in with supportive words and specific dates. \u201cWe always say our life is boring.\u201d Well, it isn\u2019t boring, but certain scenarios do seem to recur. These days, when Benjamin isn\u2019t on stage accepting an award at some fancy gala, she\u2019s hidden in a quiet corner afterwards counselling and embracing a stranger, who may be sobbing. Except they\u2019re never really strangers \u2013 they\u2019re her \u201cPlay School babies\u201d, all grown up now, with responsible, high-flying careers, yet still hungry for Benjamin\u2019s approval. \u201cMost of the ministers in parliament are my Play School babies,\u201d she says with satisfaction. This is a matter of both pride and practical use in Benjamin\u2019s position as a Lib Dem peer in the House of Lords, Baroness Benjamin of Beckenham. The Beckenham part has special significance. It was in this London suburb that her parents, whom she calls Marmie and Dardie, eventually settled, after arriving from Trinidad and sending for 10-year-old Benjamin and her siblings. The racism began before they\u2019d even moved in: \u201cThey sent the police to arrest us \u2013 to say black people don\u2019t live here. My mum said, \u201cYou know something, we\u2019re going to live in this house!\u201d And we lived there for 40 years.\u201d After her peerage was announced in 2010, Benjamin visited her parents\u2019 graves in Beckenham cemetery. \u201cI said, \u2018Marmie, Dardie, I\u2019m going to claim Beckenham for you!\u2019\u201d Benjamin turned 70 this year, but her parents still come up regularly in conversation, because her upbringing is so central to who she is. It\u2019s what gave her purpose: \u201cI always say, \u2018Childhood lasts a lifetime. [My parents] gave me so much love, poured it into me all my life. So what better thing to do than to hand it back out?\u201d She hasn\u2019t always felt that love returned, however. Growing up, she was subjected to racist bullying and, on one memorable occasion, ridiculed by a teacher because of her Caribbean accent. \u201cShe said, \u2018If you want to remain in my class, you have to learn to speak the Queen\u2019s English.\u2019\u201d Benjamin was upset but, on the advice of her mother, complied. Some years later, she called upon the episode to escape an attempted sexual assault. \u201cI turned and said to him, \u2018How dare you! You guttersnipe!\u2019 I morphed myself into my teacher, because I knew how she\u2019d made me feel.\u201d Benjamin\u2019s anecdotes about her schooldays are typical of a nuanced-yet-practical approach to tackling racism, one that is sometimes misconstrued. Adapting is not about feeling ashamed of her roots \u2013 it\u2019s the opposite. \u201cI\u2019m never afraid of expressing my true me,\u201d she explains, \u201cand people take it or leave it. But I also learned from that teacher what I needed to do if I wanted to engage with people. Anywhere I go in the world, I can become.\u201d As chancellor of Exeter University during the 2012 Diamond Jubilee, she was charged with giving the Queen a guided tour. \u201cWe had a great time together. She told me stories about her family and shared ideas about life, children, food, everything. And I thought I\u2019d share my story with her. I said, \u2018You know, ma\u2019am, when I was in Trinidad, I used to stand and sing God Save the Queen. I was told I was part of the Motherland. When I came to Britain, it wasn\u2019t like that. I had to face so much adversity in Britain and so many barriers. But do you know? I don\u2019t hate anybody, I don\u2019t have any resentment in my heart.\u2019\u201d Her Majesty was moved, apparently. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018When I\u2019m speaking to you like this, it reminds me of when I was speaking to Nelson Mandela. He had the same philosophy.\u2019\u201d So the woman who was reprimanded for not speaking \u201cthe Queen\u2019s English\u201d went on to speak English with the actual Queen. Such is the trajectory of Benjamin\u2019s life. \u201cEvery day I say, \u2018Take me, show me, lead me, I\u2019m yours,\u2019\u201d she says, turning her face upwards and closing her eyes, as if to bathe in the sunlight of another blessed day. Does she never feel defeated? \u201cNothing gets me.\u201d Even the Windrush scandal couldn\u2019t shake her faith in happy resolutions. Perhaps because, for a Caribbean-born British woman who lived through the 1960s, evidence of government hostility to immigrants is not \u201cnews\u201d. When the first stories of deportations broke, Benjamin was already struggling to get funding for a Windrush-themed garden at the Chelsea Flower Show. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t see the importance of it. Why should they? It wasn\u2019t part of their schooling. So when the Windrush scandal happened, suddenly everybody knew! Everything happens for a reason. People were falling over themselves to be our sponsor and we won a gold medal. We had white, middle-class people coming up saying,\u201d \u2014 she adopts her teacher\u2019s voice again \u2014 \u201c\u2018Oh, here\u2019s the Windrush garden! I know all about Windrush!\u2019 If people had understood the history, we wouldn\u2019t have got to where we are.\u201d On other issues, too, Benjamin is a reformer, not a revolutionary. Beginning with a polite enquiry as to why Play School\u2019s story illustrations only featured white children, she has had several big successes. Most recently, she secured an amendment to encourage broadcasters to commission more quality children\u2019s programming and she\u2019s even sanguine about the rise of unboxing videos (people opening packaged products while describing what they find). \u201cIf children want to go and watch things on YouTube, fair enough. But I think if they\u2019ve got quality programmes on the main channels, they\u2019ll be watching those. Every moment matters to the child under seven. So if you\u2019re giving them rubbish, they\u2019re going to accept rubbish in life.\u201d Still, Benjamin understands that not everyone was blessed with a Marmie and Dardie like hers. Which is why, even after four decades of passionate campaigning, there is still much work to be done on the causes closest to her heart: media diversity and children\u2019s welfare. \u201cOf course I find it frustrating,\u201d she says. \u201cI weep sometimes when I\u2019m at home, but I\u2019ve got a wonderful husband who knows just what I\u2019m going through and how I\u2019ve been trying to point out the lack of diversity. I\u2019ve been told, \u2018Shut up, you\u2019ll never work again\u2019, \u2018Back off, who do you think you are?\u2019 I\u2019ve been told all of that \u2013 but I know eventually it will turn.\u201d Floella Benjamin will receive the EON Productions lifetime achievement award at the Women in Film and Television awards 2019 on 6 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
