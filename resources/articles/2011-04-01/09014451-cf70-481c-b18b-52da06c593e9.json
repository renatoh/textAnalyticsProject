Of course it's happened before \u2013 as recently as 2009 \u2013 but with so much worry about the power of the euro and the wealth of the French clubs, an Anglo-Irish set-to at the Millennium Stadium in three weeks would come like a breath of fresh air. Last season's all-French affair at the Stade de France, when Toulouse arm\u2011wrestled their way to a fourth title against Biarritz, brought a general sense of foreboding and suggestions that our much more restrictive salary cap would strangle the game this side of the Channel while adding a bit more pep to the exodus of players. It didn't help when four French sides got through to the quarter-finals this time, but then Toulon drew Perpignan in Barcelona and Biarritz took Toulouse to San Sebasti\u00e1n. That immediately halved the French presence and I fancy it to vanish altogether this weekend when both Guy Nov\u00e8s's champions and Jacques Brunel's Perpignan have to go away from home in the semi-finals. After losing home advantage \u2013 huge at this stage of the competition \u2013 Toulouse are at the magnificently futuristic Aviva Stadium in Dublin, where Leinster are rubbing their hands in anticipation of reversing last season's semi-final played at Le Stadium Municipal, while, after the mock period architecture of the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Perpignan get to sample Milton Keynes and the home of the MK Dons. Neither side will enjoy the experience. First to Dublin where Toulouse, who have seemed a little off colour in the competition, have to cope with one of the few sides in Europe you could now call a complete team. Over the years Toulouse have played Leinster eight times, winning five, but under Joe Schmidt the Irish have continued to develop more of an edge. Their backs have always been quality, but that no longer comes at the expense of a powder puff pack. Props such as Cian Healy and Mike Ross seem finally to be first choice for Ireland and the hooker Richardt Strauss not only adds to the power up front, but is more than handy in the loose as well. Add a back row including Jamie Heaslip and Sean O'Brien and you have a pack that is a handful for anyone. Then add Schmidt's knowledge of the Top 14 gained during years with Clermont Auvergne and a team seemingly fit and well and you have a potent mix. Ahead of Wasps game in the pool stages, Joe offered what turned out to be useful advice about playing Toulouse which I won't pass on, except to say be in your seats from the start or you might miss something. If I had to pick out a key man it would be David Skrela, who was pretty pedestrian against Biarritz and will have to up his pace considerably if he doesn't want O'Brien in his face all afternoon. I'm in Dublin and fancy it could be the match of the competition so far whereas Sunday at Milton Keynes is likely to be more for those who enjoy two power sides going hammer and tongs. More precisely the front five of Northampton versus the possibly reduced scrummaging power of Perpignan. After Barcelona, Brunel rested a lot of the guys who are likely to play on Sunday, but we do know he will be without his French international prop J\u00e9r\u00f4me Schuster and there are suggestions that Perry Freshwater, part of the front row trio that so undermined Leicester's scrum before Christmas, is nursing a damaged shoulder. Against Toulon in Barcelona, Freshwater came off the bench to score the try which finally settled the match but he was missing completely \u2013 along with Nicolas Mas and the hooker Guilhem Guirado \u2013 when the sides met again in the league last weekend and going up against a front row of Brian Mujati, Dylan Hartley and Soane Tonga'uiha is tough enough without carrying an injury. With their England contingent back, Northampton are a force again and will have learned a lot from being stung by Munster last time around. They'll miss Tom Wood, particularly in the lineout, but watch out for big performances from some of those who don't always get the headlines \u2013 the powerful centres, Jon Clarke and James Downey for example, and Christian Day, said to be the mastermind in the lineout. It's time for the French to have a headache."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
