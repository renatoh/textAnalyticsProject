James Bond's preferred watch is an Omega, while Spider-Man likes a drop of Dr Pepper. But while product placement is rife in film, British television programmes have long had to make up fictional products, such as pints of Newton &amp; Ridley in Coronation Street's Rovers Return, or simply tape over the logos of real ones. That is all likely to change this week after a decision that is expected to allow commercial broadcasters to show sponsored products for the first time. The move will be a boon for the broadcasters, who have been struggling to deal with falls in advertising revenue. Some experts believe deals could raise as much as \u00a3125m annually for the industry, although publicly funded organisations such as the BBC will remain exempt. The ban will also stay in place for certain programmes, including shows aimed at children. ITV, which has campaigned for a loosening of the rules, said revenue from advertisers would ease financial troubles as revenues fall during the recession. A spokesman for ITV said: \"ITV plc has led the campaign for product placement in the UK, which could be an important new revenue stream, as it already is in Europe. Reforming the UK prohibition would also be a welcome acknowledgement of the pressures currently faced by an industry in transition. New sources of revenue mean better funded content \u2013 which can only be good news for viewers.\" In March, the then culture secretary, Andy Burnham, said lifting the ban raised \"very serious concerns\" and was \"blurring the boundaries between advertising and editorial\". His successor, Ben Bradshaw, who is expected to announce a three-month consultation on the changes in a Royal Television Society speech this week, said instead that the \"climate has changed\" and has accepted lifting the ban \"in principle\". Television companies have also been divided. While the ITV executive chairman, Michael Grade, called Burnham's decision \"perverse\" and said that product placement \"would bring more realism to programming,\" Andy Duncan, chief executive of Channel 4, said it raised serious issues of trust for viewers. \"We have consistently taken the view that confusing the lines between editorial and advertising raises serious issues of trust for viewers,\" he said. \"Relaxing the rules would deliver a marginal commercial benefit and do little to redress the growing funding imbalance between state- and advertising-funded broadcasting.\" But supporters of the move, which has the backing of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, said that products already appeared regularly on television and that lifting the ban would lead to greater consistency and transparency, as well as providing funding. Under current rules, products can be shown as long as they are used as props \u2013 so-called free placement \u2013 but broadcasters are forbidden from receiving payment for their use. Peter Bazalgette, an independent television producer responsible for bringing Big Brother to the masses, said lifting the ban would was overdue. \"Andy Burnham's decision flew in the face of all common sense. Television isn't special any more. In the 60s it was fully regulated and piped straight into homes. Now we have online sources which aren't regulated. There's got to be trust in the public. If it's done in a crass way, producers and broadcasters would be incredibly stupid, as it would devalue the whole thing.\" He added: \"In America product placement accounts for around 5 or 6% of the advertising cake. In the UK the size of commercial revenue is worth around \u00a32.6bn but it's been falling because of competition with online, Google and the rest. In the next two to three years, product placement could be worth up to \u00a3125m. It's not the saviour of commercial broadcasters but it helps, particularly because brands like to get closer. These days, adverts can be fast forwarded.\" In many European countries and the US, product placement is rife and plugs are common. According to Nielsen market research, there were 117,976 placements across America's top 11 television channels in the first three months of 2008. American Idol, the most watched show in the US, had more than 4,000 instances of product placement in 2007, including shots of judges drinking from Coca-Cola branded cups \u2013 a deal thought to be worth $35m (\u00a321m) a year to the programme. Logos in shows such as American Idol are currently blurred out when aired on British television and on reality shows contestants are given products covered in gaffer tape. Dave Turtle, spokesman for Mediawatch UK, which campaigns for socially responsible broadcasting, said: \"We shouldn't be using television programmes to push a product. We're not saying no to all product placement, but broadcasters need to be responsible about which audiences they're selling to and what. Self-regulation isn't working. Do we really want to go down the American road where you're bombarded constantly?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
