Here is our round-up of what the professionals are forecasting for the year ahead. Equities and funds Most analysts and fund managers believe equities are the way forward in 2013. Jane Coffey, head of equities at Royal London Asset Management, says equity markets could give a total return of at least 10% this year, \"unless European or US politicians mess up their fiscal policies and the major economies slow sharply\" \u2013 a big caveat, admittedly. To put this in context the FTSE 100 alone went up by just 2.7% in 2012. She adds: \"The best strategy for investors remains buying on the dips and aiming to build a long-term position in high-quality companies with strong balance sheets, growing cashflows and rising dividend yields.\" Richard Buxton, a fund manager at Schroders, is strongly backing UK equities in particular. He says: \"I believe we are in the foothills of a new bull market.\" He says valuations, based on price-earnings ratio, mean the next 10 years should provide \"positive real returns for investors, possibly double-digit per annum, despite the economic headwinds we face\". Equities are also the asset class of choice of Chelsea Financial Services' Darius MacDermott. He said: \"There will be volatility but we should see positive returns and pretty much every market is attractively valued. I'd go for an equity income fund and reinvest the dividends. As most UK investors already have a UK equity income fund, diversifying into a global fund might be a good option. My fund tip is Newton Global Higher Income but you can't go far wrong with a core investment in Axa Framlington UK Select Opportunities or Schroder UK Alpha Plus.\" Adrian Lowcock of Hargreaves Lansdown picks five find managers to watch in 2013: Sebastian Lyon of Troy Asset Management's Trojan fund; Adrian Frost, manager of Artemis Income; Jonathan Asante of First State Global Emerging Markets Leaders; Tom McDobell of M&amp;G Recovery; and Julian Fosh and Anthony Cross of Liontrust Special Situations. Bonds and gilts Few professionals put corporate or government bonds high on their list of asset classes that will do well in 2013, with many worrying about a \"bond bubble\" and others actively warning against gilts. Andrew Wells, global chief investment officer of fixed income at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, says: \"In developed markets, high-quality government bonds do indeed appear overvalued versus our fair value models. This could remain the case for some time.\" MacDermott says fixed income has experienced a \"phenomenal rally\" in the last couple of years but believes this is unsustainable. \"Gilts continue to worry me,\" he said. \"They once offered risk-free returns, now they just offer return-free risks. Investment grade and high yield bonds are slightly better with pockets of value but stock-picking will be key.\" He reckons investors looking to access the bond market could do worse than Henderson Strategic Bond fund. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is also worried about gilts. It says that while government bond yields in the US, UK and Germany are expected to rise modestly, this could result in total returns as low as -3% (or as high as just 2%). Emerging markets According to Barings, more than three in five financial advisers believe that their clients should be increasing exposure to emerging market equities. Its latest investment barometer survey indicates that 55% of financial advisers think their clients should increase their exposure to Asian equities (excluding Japan), with 32% now \"very favourable\" towards emerging market equities, though bonds were also backed. Edward Bland, director and head of research at Duncan Lawrie Private Bank, picked India for 2012 and was proved right when the country's main stock market index was the clear winner last year compared with other Bric (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries. For 2013, he selects China: \"We believe valuations in China have reached historically low levels. The transition to new leadership has gone smoothly, providing more certainty. China is certainly set to be the top dog in 2013 but India's long-term potential mustn't be discounted: it remains a compelling longer-term investment proposition.\"Dr Slim Feriani, manager of the Advance Frontiers and Advance Developing Markets trusts, adds: \"It is probably fair to say that any downside is limited, with a lot of potential bad news already priced in as valuations are in the bottom quartile of their long term range. A repeat of 2012 is possible, but we prefer our glass half full and consider that 2013 could surprise to the upside as the focus on these risks continues to fade, and investors wake up to the reality of historic low valuations and stronger than the developed world growth in emerging and frontier markets.\" How to invest in the new regime If you need advice before investing any of your hard-earned cash, you'll discover there are new rules on how financial advisers charge for their services. From 1 January 2013, advisers have to charge upfront fees to their customers rather than receive commission from companies supplying financial products. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) hopes the world of advice will become more transparent as a result and there will be far less mis-selling. It also believes consumers will save money by not paying commission to advisers. But it could put off some people who will balk at the upfront cost of advice (a quote of thousands of pounds sounds far worse than a quote of 1%); while some advisers will simply up their fees to cover the lost commission, pricing out thousands of smaller or novice investors. Nine out of 10 consumers would only pay up to \u00a325 for an hour's financial advice, compared with around \u00a350-\u00a3250 an hour fee expected following the rule change, according to a recent survey by Rostrum Research. The result could be a new generation of investors who try to go it alone and use execution-only share- and fund-dealing services rather than pay upfront fees. They might save money in the short-term but will it translate into longer-term gains?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
