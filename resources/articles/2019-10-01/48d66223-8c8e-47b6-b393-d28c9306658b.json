You\u2019re bound to make mistakes in your first few years of operation, but you needn\u2019t resign yourself to constantly cutting corners to make things work. Upskill in industry best practice to stay confident and committed to your vision. Improve (or outsource) your website and social media presence From metrics and engagement to curation and automation, the world of social media community building and sophisticated website templates can be challenging and time-consuming. More often than not, websites and social media are last on your to-do list when you\u2019re caught up in the everyday operations of your business. \u201cIt\u2019s common for small business owners to go, \u2018Wow, I don\u2019t have any idea about how to develop a web page or social media presence\u2019,\u201d says Anthony Jones, TAFE NSW\u2019s Skills for Business program coordinator. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to have that mindset shift from working in the business, to on your business. It\u2019s a different skill set.\u201d Building a social media presence and website that reflect the personality and values of your business can pay off in unexpected ways: it\u2019s a way to communicate with customers and prospects when they\u2019re not in-store, you can reach new audiences, build your authority in the market, and drive traffic to your website, which could also contribute to a boost in sales. Jones recommends two ways of maximising learning about digital media: developing your skills in a hands-on way, or using your skills to brief a professional to take on the work, in terms of scoping, budgeting and maintaining a consistent presence in line with best practices. Stay on-target with financial planning Financial acumen may not come naturally to most people, but small business owners who commit to honing their skills in this area will be able to make better day-to-day decisions once they have a financial plan in place. \u201cMost small businesses fail because of lack of capital - they\u2019ve got great ideas but they just don\u2019t have that money to handle leaner times,\u201d Jones says. From making sure you have a cash cushion in place, to staying ahead of your competitors in the long run, to spotting and taking advantage of market trends, to measuring your progress, financial planning keeps you grounded in the overall health and efficiency of your business. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a startup or a corporation, you constantly need to be able to look at how your business is tracking financially,\u201d Jones says. Document everything \u2013 from receipts to operational budgets to taxes Dealing with your finances at tax time, preparing operational budgets and keeping track of your expenses can be a minefield if you don\u2019t have a systematic way of documenting and sorting through all the information that contributes to keeping your business running. \u201cA lot of small businesspeople don\u2019t appreciate that actually spending more time initially to set those systems, procedures and processes in place gives you a big efficiency dividend,\u201d Jones says. Keeping records, setting up filing systems, downloading software to store information that is easily retrievable and putting budgets together are examples of how different aspects of a business\u2019s operations can be documented, Jones says. A fear of financial literacy can disadvantage small business owners, but this can be remedied in a supportive environment. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that have a great fear of just being able to do simple maths. Things like percentages and weighted averages, for example. We want to help small business owners by building up their confidence and saying to them, \u2018Look, it\u2019s not a big deal. You can do this.\u2019\u201d Feel more confident managing a team There comes a time in every small business owner\u2019s career journey when they realise they can no longer operate as a sole trader - and that hiring staff, and growing a team, offer the opportunity to build something more ambitious. People skills may not come naturally to every small business owner or founder, but these skills can be developed and nurtured over time, Jones says. \u201cBeing able to relate well to other people and to be able to encourage those other people is important. It\u2019s absolutely critical to be able to build open and honest relationships with your employees.\u201d There\u2019s also a big difference between managing and leading a team of people you\u2019ve hired or have been placed in charge of. \u201cLeadership is about recognising potential in other people and developing that person\u2019s potential That\u2019s the critical part: empowering someone to take risks on your behalf. That\u2019s pretty hard to do.\u201d Jones encourages small business owners to consider the advantages of bringing more people on board. \u201cThe only way you\u2019re going to grow is to bring in more talent and to bring in people with different skills to yourself. That\u2019s how innovation happens. It\u2019s a risk, sure, but it\u2019s the way forward to actually grow your business.\u201d Take control of your small business with Skills for Business training from TAFE NSW.
