It is a freewheeling, endlessly sweet-natured docu-fiction crossover piece, featuring a director called Gomes, a somewhat sleepy-eyed auteur who affects a tomato-red bomber jacket and preposterous white cap. The film follows a self-created, evolutionary path; it just goes with its own flow, summoning up memories of French film-makers such as Eric Rohmer and documentarists Nicolas Philibert and Raymond Depardon, and in its deliberate drift from fiction into fact, there is perhaps an echo of Pedro Costa. It begins with the quasi-fictional Gomes and his crew constructing a teeteringly elaborate pattern of dominoes on the floor of a garage, apparently ready for a credit sequence: to Gomes's dismay, his producers blunder in, demanding an explanation for the lack of progress, knocking one domino and catastrophically setting the rest in motion: they have, however, demonstrated the remorseless yet arbitrary nature of conventional cause-and-effect narrative. In the final moments, Gomes has a tense argument with his sound man about the non-existent ambient noises his microphone is somehow picking up, like music in the middle of a forest. The sound man stoutly defends his magically non-realist approach to the art of the cinema: the comedy is elusive and deadpan, but terrifically likable. Like Chuck Berry, Our Beloved Month of August has no particular place to go. Gomes meanders lovingly across the rural Portuguese landscape; his movie lingers repeatedly at music festivals, listening to dance bands and quite simply hangs out with its semi-fictional characters for no other reason that Gomes plainly feels very affectionate towards them. The ostensible point of this film is that Gomes and his crew have come to a Portuguese village to shoot a horror film based on Little Red Riding Hood, using only non-professionals. But shooting has stalled. Nothing is happening. The producers are antsy and grumpy. The script appears to have been entirely ignored. The director is now interested in simply filming the people of the town as they talk about this film and about their own lives: the result is a lovely, unforced, wholly charming series of vignettes. Could it be that the real Gomes really did want to make a horror film, which for some reason could not be completed, and then decided on salvaging his extant footage to create instead this docu-portrait of the place? Or was every moment of his film authorially willed from the beginning? Or is the \"real\" nature of film precisely what is being questioned here? Either way \u2013 just as we are beginning to accustom ourselves to nothing happening \u2013 something does. An intense, even passionate story surfaces from this calm millpond. T\u00e2nia (S\u00f3nia Bandeira) is the singer in a dance band run by her overprotective father. He is obsessed with T\u00e2nia's resemblance to her mother, who ran off with a Lisbon doctor many years before, and deeply angry and scared at her growing infatuation with her cousin H\u00e9lder (F\u00e1bio Oliveira). Their story is involving and unexpectedly moving. Our Beloved Month Of August is a real one-off: eccentric and singular and cerebral: an arthouse event, yes, but also witty and emotionally engaged. I found myself thinking about it for days afterwards \u2013 and smiling a very great deal. Try it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
