Wales was forecast to bear the brunt of the fresh snowfalls, which come as parts of the country emerge from freezing weather that caused travel chaos in the runup to Christmas. Parts of central England were warned to prepare for bad weather hitting the roads as some people return to work after the festive break. Paul Knightley, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said a system moving in from the Atlantic tonight would meet colder air, leading to snow falling tomorrow. \"Across higher ground in central and south Wales, we can expect to see heavy snow \u2013 20cm to 30cm, or up to a foot \u2013 by Tuesday lunchtime, with strong winds pushing it higher in drifts. \"Tuesday is going to be a nasty day across much of Wales. \"We can also expect to see falls of 5cm to 10cm in parts of the Midlands. We are not sure how far north or how far south this snow could fall. Southern counties may have some snow on Tuesday morning, but not enough to settle.\" \"There could be problems anywhere in Wales, or large parts of central and southern England, in the next 48 to 72 hours \u2013 people should check forecasts before going out.\" The snowfall is predicted to be followed by freezing temperatures to greet the new year. New Year's Eve could see lows of -3C in most of England and Wales and -8C in Scotland, with snow showers also forecast. The Welsh assembly government said contingency plans were in place to deal with the fresh cold snap. A spokeswoman said: \"We have contingency plans in place in the event of extreme weather to ensure the main roads are kept open and also have encouraged unitary authorities to put in place mutual aid arrangements.\" Cardiff airport said passengers should check the status of their flights if the predicted snowfall arrives. In a separate development, a man died after slipping on ice while visiting a cemetery on Christmas Day. Jimmy Halpin died after falling while laying a wreath at his mother's grave at Urmston cemetery in Greater Manchester. The 53-year-old suffered serious head and neck injuries and was pronounced dead on arrival at Trafford general hospital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
