He\u2019s got a tattoo of one on his left arm, partially hidden today by a black T-shirt \u2013 but that\u2019s not all. Whenever Elba needs to mark a major event in his life \u2013 birthdays, new years, that kind of thing \u2013 he heads outside and wraps his arms around a trunk. \u201cI just feel a massive connection to the roots that are underneath, which are very high and wide, and to the oxygen that comes from the top,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s me in the middle \u2026 Idris Elba, tree-hugger!\u201d He lets out a burst of laughter, as does the director Kwame Kwei-Armah. The pair are here today because they\u2019ve collaborated on a new project called, funnily enough, Tree \u2013 an ambitious mix of music, dance and drama set to premiere at this year\u2019s Manchester international festival. The pair have known each other for decades but this is the first time they\u2019ve worked together. \u201cThe seeds are laid right,\u201d Elba says, and the metaphors continue, with much talk of \u201ccultivating\u201d and \u201cplanting\u201d in their creative process. The production\u2019s \u201cdeepest roots\u201d, says Elba, grew from his experience in South Africa playing Nelson Mandela in the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. For inspiration on how to emulate the man, Elba had looked to his own father, who shared Mandela\u2019s infectious smile and similarly pointed with his middle finger \u2013 yet shortly after seeing the movie, his dad died. Elba felt compelled to revisit the country and make an album in his father\u2019s honour \u2013 2014\u2019s Mi Mandela \u2013 that featured a song called Tree, \u201cwhich is sort of on the nose, a love letter to my dad\u201d. Elba wanted to explore the idea of taking the album\u2019s songs to the stage, and so he reached out to Kwei-Armah, artistic director of the Young Vic theatre. \u201cIdris talked to me about putting his arms around this tree, that spiritual moment of connecting with nature. The thing that excited me about it was that, from the jump, Idris was like, \u2018Look we could do a musical or we could do a play, but what\u2019s the thing? How do we play with the form? The central pin became this story of a young man going back home to meet his Afrikaners grandmother. [But] I don\u2019t actually think we mention race in the piece at all. What we do is we put people in situations that say, \u2018Now read what you need to read\u2019 and \u2018How do we negotiate the pain of that?\u2019\u201d The pair first met years ago, although the specifics are hazy. They became closer while navigating their careers as black British actors in the 1990s, staying in touch as they both achieved success in the US: Elba for his portrayal of Baltimore drug kingpin Stringer Bell in The Wire; Kwei-Armah becoming the artistic director of Centre Stage in 2011, also in Baltimore. Three days after arriving in the city, Kwei-Armah recalls finding out Elba had won a Golden Globe for his Wire role. \u201cI remember sitting in my cousin\u2019s yard, and I texted him, just going, \u2018Bruv, man is just so proud of you\u2019 and not expecting to get anything back. [But] straight back, bam, Idris is like \u2018Thank you brother.\u2019\u201d It was on returning to Baltimore, to direct Soul: The Stax Musical in 2018, that Kwei-Armah listened to Mi Mandela again. \u201cI got all goosebumpy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mother had died, and my mother was my everything, so [when] Idris began to speak about his father, and his connection with the universe through this thing \u2026\u201d He trails off. \u201cI went, \u2018Come we go. Let\u2019s do this.\u2019\u201d Now the two men are working with a cast that includes Alfred Enoch, the young black British actor who went to the US to star alongside Viola Davis in the hit series How to Get Away With Murder. Kwei-Armah smiles: \u201cAlfie came to an early workshop, he got off the plane from Brazil, hadn\u2019t even looked at my script. Thank God, because it was really bad then. I completely rewrote it.\u201d Was the script a collaborative process, too? \u201cWe did it together,\u201d Kwei-Armah replies, as Elba points towards Kwei-Armah and stage whispers: \u201cHe wrote it.\u201d Not for the first time, they both laugh. Kwei-Armah continues: \u201cAlfie came in, and literally within an hour, our magnificent choreographer, Gregory Maqoma, was holding him upside down.\u201d The physicality of the show, both on stage and in the way the audience is placed on stage alongside the performers, is inspired by Elba\u2019s dual career as an actor and a DJ. \u201cI play house music, it\u2019s quite insular, but essentially it\u2019s like [the crowd is] climbing into my head, and I\u2019m climbing into theirs. I explained that energy to Kwame.\u201d He says he was aiming for \u201ca different type of listening\u201d, where the audience realise: \u201c\u2018Oh shit, I\u2019m in the drama!\u2019\u201d Kwei-Armah nods: \u201cWe said, \u2018Do you know what, let\u2019s make this a gig.\u2019 I loved that challenge. We had to say, \u2018All right there\u2019s going to be no seats, very few seats, people are going to be in the space.\u2019 And that\u2019s hard when it comes to scripting! Because after 10 minutes everyone\u2019s going to be, like, \u2018I need to know why I\u2019m standing.\u2019 The challenge is to create a piece of physical theatre that has dance and brilliant music [by Mikey J Asante], and actually include the audience in the storytelling. Will you be thrown about? Probably not thrown. Will you be moved about? Yes. Will you be asked to hold and carry? Yes. Will you be asked to vocally participate? Yes. If we get it right. Will you be asked to be in the play, not just observing? Yes.\u201d The immersive nature of Tree has leaked into the rehearsal process, with the creators operating a rehearsal room where people are regularly invited in \u2014 including me. During the company\u2019s morning briefing, which involves everyone in the space holding hands in a large circle, Kwei-Armah asks how everyone is. One performer speaks candidly about an encounter that reminded her how grateful she feels to be in the space. Another, Patrice Naiambana, mutters an in-joke under his breath that makes Enoch crack up laughing. Elba tells a story about being confronted by South Africans for playing Mandela despite not being of South African heritage. Earlier, he\u2019d recounted how people had told him he shouldn\u2019t be playing Mandela. \u201cThey said, \u2018We\u2019ve got actors in South Africa who are qualified.\u2019 And our director was white, and our producer was Indian.\u201d Eventually they won people over. \u201cAt the end of the process, people that were on that cusp about whether I should be there or not, were like, \u2018Thank you, I can see you just as being a vessel in playing that.\u2019\u201d As with Kaelo, the protagonist in Tree, there was a sense of \u201ccoming home. You get what I\u2019m saying?\u201d Kwei-Armah does. \u201cNot only do I get what you\u2019re saying, I wish I had articulated that to the cast on day one. The beautiful thing about the DNA of this, the DNA of our lead character, is going, \u2018Whoa, where is my legitimacy here, I\u2019ve got to find my way home.\u2019\u201d The two hope to continue working together, although perhaps in a different capacity. \u201cIt isn\u2019t something we\u2019ve really openly discussed, but this isn\u2019t the last pairing,\u201d says Elba. \u201cI haven\u2019t been on stage for a long time, and I\u2019m desperate to do that at some point. I want to come and see my guy again, because watching and being here, I feel like I have work [that is] yet to be put on to the stage.\u201d But right now they\u2019re just excited to present Tree to the world. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to be able to see something you\u2019ve planted the seed of,\u201d says Elba. \u201cAnd repot it into a different form\u201d. Kwei-Armah laughs once more: \u201cThis is why we\u2019re going to keep working together. We\u2019ve got to keep these garden metaphors going!\u201d Tree is at Upper Campfield Market Hall, Manchester, as part of Manchester international festival, 29 June-13 July. Then at the Young Vic, London, 29 July-24 August.
