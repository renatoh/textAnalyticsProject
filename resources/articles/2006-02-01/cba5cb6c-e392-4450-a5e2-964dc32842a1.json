In the newly created role, Mr Freeman will oversee major entertainment \"events\" including the National Television Awards, the British Comedy Awards, the Baftas, Record of the Year, the Soap Awards and the Brits. He will also be responsible for spearheading ITV's drive into new large-scale entertainment shows such as the Prince's Trust Concert, which he will produce in 2006. \"The creation of this new role reflects a new emphasis on major one-off entertainment evenings,\" said Mr Jackson. \"ITV is the home of big, talked about events that unite mass audiences and we are keen to find more new and exciting opportunities in this area.\" Mr Freeman - a former managing director of Millionaire producer Celador subsidiary, Celador Music &amp; Events - began his career as a cameraman at the BBC in 1983, where he worked with Mr Jackson on The Young Ones. He moved into the BBC's entertainment department in 1989, where he spent years running Saturday night stalwart, Noel's House Party. \"The fact that specials and one-offs are seen as a vital part of ITV's future, by both [the ITV director of television] Simon Shaps and Paul make this an irresistible opportunity that I hope will excite not just me, but all event and music producers out there,\" said Mr Freeman. Mr Jackson is understood to be looking to make two other senior appointments in the ITV entertainment department - one executive overseeing format entertainment such as I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!, and another to take charge of studio-based entertainment such as Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway. He will also be recruiting a new head of comedy, following the announcement last month that Sioned Wiliam is to leave ITV. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
