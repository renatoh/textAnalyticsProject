They saw players' wages jump 20% last season to account for 45% of turnover, just below the 48% ratio of Manchester United, the world's richest club. \"The main factor on profits for football clubs is keeping wages under control,\" said their chairman Freddy Shepherd. \"We have one of the youngest squads in the Premier League with an average age of 24 and we are focusing on our academy and the training of young players.\" Newcastle reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a33.1m for the year to July 31 following a loss of \u00a38.9m the previous year. After tax and dividend payments they recorded an overall loss of \u00a37.5m. Shepherd said the only way back into profit would be by controlling wages. The new Brighton manager Steve Coppell will try to borrow Premiership players in a bid to avoid relegation. Coppell, who replaced Martin Hinselwood on Monday, has been told there is no budget to sign new players. \"Premiership clubs have big staffs and the option of loan players, which has been beneficial for me in the past, is one I will be looking at,\" said Coppell \"There are still players that haven't found clubs and there may be the odd one who can make a contribution.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
