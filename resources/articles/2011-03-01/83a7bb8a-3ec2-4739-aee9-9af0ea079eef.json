Twenty years ago he wrote a one-act play, Man of Letters, about an encounter between age and youth on a Batley rooftop. This is apparently his second attempt to turn it into a full-length play, but it remains a desperately slight, whimsical piece that tries to get by on a few good jokes. When we first meet Frank and Alan, the former is a veteran installer of illuminated signs and the latter a gauche young assistant on work experience. Three years later the unemployed Frank has become a humble jobseeker, while Alan has risen to the giddy heights of a trainee assistant manager in an electrical superstore. The second, livelier act allows Firth the chance to take a few accurate potshots at the corruption of language in the retail trade. \"A customer,\" Alan sagely informs Frank, \"brings only custom, but a client brings commitment.\" But Firth never really explains why a potential, seemingly gifted artist like Alan should settle for life as a salesman, and spells out all too clearly his point that the younger man is gradually turning into a replica of the older one. The piece depends heavily on the charm of its performers. Matthew Kelly does a good job in showing Frank's shift from being a bossy supervisor, secretly nursing ambitions to be a writer of spy thrillers, into a supplicant for work. Gerard Kearns, making his West End debut after playing in Shameless, also captures Alan's initial perkiness and subsequent descent into a peddler of management-speak. But, although the two actors and director Peter Wilson put as much flesh on the piece as they can, I find the play's tone of feelgood sentimentality grating. At a time of increasing unemployment amongst both young and old, there seems to me little room for a bland comedy that argues we should all sit back, accept life's disappointments, and live off our private dreams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
