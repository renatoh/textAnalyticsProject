Here our narrator, Chick, is sandwiched between Michael Jackson's entourage and the penthouse in which his friend Ravelstein, the powerhouse liberal academic whose biography he has been asked to write, is staying. Two non-Wasp superstars, both sell-outs in their respective arenas. Ravelstein is magnificent in thought, outlook, and action; he is also dying. Bellow's promise to Allan Bloom, the real Ravelstein, to honour him in a memoir, prompted his first novel in 13 years. Whimsical and meandering Ravelstein may be, but it's Bellow, written with energy and finesse. The Time of Light Gunnar Kopperud Bloomsbury, \u00a36.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL \"Is it possible to make up for war?\" is the question that Norwegian journalist Kopperud has set himself to answer through his first novel. An old man sits weeping as he watches the preparations for Armenia's 1994 war against Azerbaijan. A priest is summoned and the man begins his confession. It starts in pre-war Germany and, inevitably, leads to the battle for Stalingrad, then to the Caucasus as a PoW. Kopperud is bleakly graphic in describing atrocity, and his picture of the loneliness and haphazard comradeship of war is affecting. But his discussion of guilt, cultural identity, war and atonement does not measure up against the enormity of the history he uses. Midnight Tales Bram Stoker Peter Owen \u00a39.95 Buy it at a discount at BOL Tracked down by editor Peter Haining in forgotten magazines, these dozen tales are curiously nasty Victorian parlour chillers. Stoker, known in his lifetime for being Henry Irving's manager, wrote much else besides Dracula , though in similar vein. The mechanics are cruder, but the familiarity of form is pleasurable. \"All my English blood rose,\" explains Jonathan Harker in \"The Dream in the Dead House\", an excised episode from Dracula , before telling his coachman \"Go home, Johann - Walpurgis Nacht doesn't concern Englishmen.\" Tried out on Irving's post-performance dinner guests, these so-so tales would sit better as appendages to Dracula itself. Artemisia Alexandra Lapierre Vintage, \u00a37.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL The 17th-century Italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi is an attractive but difficult subject. There are, according to Lapierre, \"drawers full of doctoral theses\" on a woman about whom history knows two important things: she was a painter who was raped by a fellow painter. The novel boasts a four-page character list and a liking for good earthy Roman painters who talk of fellatio while painting frescoes. Research, though, is Lapierre's undoing - commissions are counted off, and not a drop of information is wasted. Conversations and situations are wooden, characters lack perspective and structure is absent. One more for the drawer? A New World Amit Chaudhuri Picador, \u00a36.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL Mood will determine whether you find Chaudhuri's novel utterly absorbing, or infuriatingly inconsequential. The story is an old one: the adult child on a visit to parents is a tool to explore the rift between generations and cultures. So Jayojit, a newly divorced economist, flies from the US to sticky Calcutta with his son, Bonny, to visit his parents. Inside their apartment we spend a slow holiday of meals, showers, and very occasional trips beyond the front door. Jayojit observes his parents' old-fashioned marriage; they come to terms with his modern divorce. Chaudhuri is an expert miniaturist, and A New World makes many virtues out of small things."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
