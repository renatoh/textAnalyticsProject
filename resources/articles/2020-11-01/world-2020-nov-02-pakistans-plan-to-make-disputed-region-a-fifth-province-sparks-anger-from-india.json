The strategic area bordering China and Afghanistan forms part of Pakistan-administered Kashmir \u2013 an area claimed by Pakistan and India, but controlled by Pakistan since the war of independence in 1947. Gilgit-Baltistan, for decades ruled by Pakistan\u2019s central government, has no representative in the federal parliament and cannot bring cases to the supreme court, but making it a provisional province gives the region stronger constitutional and voting rights, more local autonomy and increased powers for its legislative assembly. \u201cAdministrative, political and economic reforms are a longstanding demand of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan,\u201d said a statement by the Pakistan government. For the state to officially become Pakistan\u2019s fifth province, it would require an amendment to the constitution. India, which claims sovereignty over the entire state of Kashmir, responded vehemently to the announcement by Khan, stating that it \u201ccategorically rejects\u201d the move. India\u2019s ministry of external affairs said \u201cso-called Gilgit-Baltistan\u201d was Indian territory and the declaration of the region as a Pakistan province was an attempt to camouflage an \u201cillegal and forcible occupation\u201d of the area. The announcement by Khan is the latest escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan over the troubled territory of Kashmir. In August last year, India infuriated Pakistan by removing the special semi-autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir \u2013 the part of the Kashmir region that falls on the Indian side of the border \u2013 and bringing the state fully under the control of the Indian government for the first time since partition. The announcement by Khan also came less than a month before the 2 million people of Gilgit-Baltistan are to go to the polls for their legislative assembly, which currently has very limited powers. The move has been seen as a clear attempt by the prime minister to win over voters at a time when the popularity of Khan\u2019s ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) is in severe decline amid economic collapse, record levels of inflation and increasingly united political opposition. Many in the region viewed the announcement with scepticism and it was seen by some as a half measure, without committing to enshrining the change in the constitution. Naveed Saleem, a student in Gilgit-Baltistan, said: \u201cKhan is bluffing. This provisional status is not what we asked for. It still wouldn\u2019t make Gilgit-Pakistan a constitutional part of Pakistan. We still can\u2019t vote for the prime minister of Pakistan. We still can\u2019t go to supreme court of Pakistan. It\u2019s a joke.\u201d Shaan Mohammed Khan, an IT expert from the state, was similarly mistrustful. \u201cWithout a constitutional change, Imran Khan\u2019s words mean nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cAs general elections are near they are doing this only to increase their vote bank.\u201d The move is one that will particularly satisfy Pakistan\u2019s close ally China. Beijing has been pushing for more stability and security for Gilgit-Baltistan as the region forms a crucial part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), an infrastructure project running through Pakistan, which is the flagship of Xi Jinping\u2019s belt and road initiative. \u201cGiven the depth of India-Pakistan tensions, this will certainly raise temperatures even more,\u201d said Michael Kugelman, the deputy director of the Asia Program and a senior associate for south Asia at the Wilson Center. \u201cPakistan has sought to make this change for quite some time, and with both Pakistan-India and India-China relations in deep crisis, the timing makes sense from a geopolitical context,\u201d added Kugelman. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to push back against New Delhi on two fronts: it delivers a blow to its claim to Gilgit-Baltistan, and it gives some momentum to a CPEC enterprise that India opposes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
