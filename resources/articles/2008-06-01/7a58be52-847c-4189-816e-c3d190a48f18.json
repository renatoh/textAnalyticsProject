This is the event's first year, and nurseries include Woottens of Wenhaston, which specialises in pelargoniums, day lilies and irises, and Bob Brown's Cotswold Garden Flowers, which offers a wide range of unusual herbaceous perennials. And if you have serious cash to splash, there will also be posh garden accessories on sale; cottesbrookehall.co.uk for details. Tomato tips Tomatoes are growing strongly now, but they need to be kept on the straight and narrow. Tie them into a sturdy cane or post. Side shoots that emerge from the leaf joints should be nipped off, otherwise the plant will start lumbering off in all sorts of wild directions. However, if you have a greenhouse, it is worth letting these side shoots grow a couple of inches long before you remove them. Push them into a small pot of soil, and they will take root and produce a late crop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
