I do know, or at least am reminded by that trio of capital letters, that it wasn't my dining room, which is a start. I also recall being pleasantly startled, it having struck the naked eye as a bog-standard gastropub, by the quality of the restaurant at the back and the warmth of the bar staff at the front. In that latter bit, on reflection, lies the genesis of the problem. We'd already called time on the vodka-drinking after a couple of shots of Russian Standard while examining the menu, when barman Nicolas, a charming young Parisian, gave us a couple more \"on ze arse\" (on the house, for anyone not fluent in 'Allo 'Alloese). With an Anglo-French froideur persisting after M Chirac's deranged refusal to join us in Iraq, we were duty-bound as patriots to return the compliment. Nicolas then re-returned it. Then, during a debate about the beauty of Paris, an unfortunate remark from one of us (we can all have beautiful cities if we don't fight Hitler), possibly me, obliged us to re-re-return it. No offence taken, Olivier re-re-re-returned it, we re-re-re-re-returned that, and so it went on. Precisely how many times the compliment went back and forth I cannot say. Let it suffice that when we reached the table, perhaps too many hyphens had been scattered in our wake. Now, as I'm always banging on, food is anything but the sole criterion in judging a restaurant. Such a joy had Nicolas been (manly hugs may well have been exchanged; on this my notes are inconclusive), so delightful did the service remain in the plain, uncluttered conservatory-style dining area, and at such merriment do those notes almost legibly hint that we'd have loved the place had it served the sort of fare that helped Colony to a record score of 0.05/10 a week ago. But not a bit of that, nor even the traditional gastropub stuff that has you wondering whether it arrived covered in tinfoil from a warehouse near Staines. This, so my notes insist, was totally authentic, gutsy/peasanty French cooking, twice as impressive for its unexpectedness and the fairness of the pricing. A charcuterie board came almost overladen with excellent hams and great, garlicky salamis, while a pork terrine arrived in a vast dish along with the insistence that we should eat as much as we wished. There's a generosity of spirit here that does the heart good, although whether taking them at their word did as much for the coronary arteries seems unlikely. So much of it did we put away that we could have done without the main courses. But that would have been unprofessional, and I won't have anyone accuse me of that. When I go back, I'll bully whoever's lumbered to share one of the huge pies on offer (a cute, farmhousey touch). On this occasion, however, the record states that I went for the bavette and my friend, making a pre-emptive strike against the hangover, for the stodgiest and least Gallic thing on this highly enticing menu: fish and chips. \"Perfect,\" he said. \"Fresh fish, well fried, cracking chips \u2013 can't fault it in any way.\" The cheapest bovine cuts tend to be the tastiest as well as the toughest, and although this grilled bavette, or skirt, was a bit chewy (really it needs slow cooking), it had enough depth of flavour not to need the peppercorn sauce ordered on the side, delicious though that was. Puddings were unthinkable after that lot, so we finished our pints and Irish coffees, before heading over the road to a pub to pass a giggly couple of hours amassing background research by interrogating our now off-duty waitress Sophie and her colleague Jill. They told us that the owner, one Olivier Lavigne du Cadet, is a sweetheart, and that he runs his restaurant as a labour of love. That fact our dinner had already branded on the memory. If only it had had a little company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
