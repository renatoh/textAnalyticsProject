The paymaster general, Dawn Primarolo, said almost 40,000 applications had to be halted in eight months last year - around half because of suspected organised crime. That was more than double the number in the whole of the previous financial year and has renewed pressure for a full review of the system's security. The Liberal Democrat's work and pensions secretary, David Laws, who secured the latest figures through parliamentary questions to the Treasury, said they could just be \"the tip of an iceberg\". \"Revenue officials have openly admitted that they have little idea of the full extent of the fraud - only that they have been subjected to virulent attacks.\" And he said the paymaster general had been \"far too complacent about the weaknesses in the system\". \"It is clear that she has known about these problems for at least a year; it cannot be acceptable that it took so long to take action. \"Even now we do not know to what extent security checks have actually been tightened up. \"We need an urgent, independent investigation into the full extent of the problem and what is being done to tackle it.\" In her replies to Mr Laws, the paymaster general said that between April and November last year, HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) intervened in 38,924 claims where fraud or error was suspected. \"HMRC estimate over half have been as a result of organised attacks,\" she said. That compared with a total of 17,164 in 2004/5. Another 22,284 claims that were already being paid were stopped because of suspected organised fraud from October 2004 to November 2005, she said. There had been 159 prosecutions for tax credit fraud so far this financial year, she told him, with 97 other cases awaiting a verdict. An HMRC spokesman said the system was always likely to become a target for fraudsters and the figures showed they were being tackled. \"HMRC has robust strategies in place for tackling fraud. Anywhere that the government pays out money there will be some people intent on defrauding the system and we designed tax credits with that in mind,\" he said. \"Like any other large financial organisation, HMRC constantly adapts its methods in the light of evidence on attempted fraud. \"It has introduced more sophisticated checks, and announced in the 2005 pre-budget report that it is doubling the number of pre-award checks.\" The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, called on Gordon Brown to reform the system. \"The sad reality of Gordon Brown's chaotic administration of the tax credit system is that thousands of deserving low-income families suffer hardship while the level of fraud continues to rocket because of his obsession with complexity and meddling,\" he said. \"Mr Brown should acknowledge the legitimate criticisms of independent bodies like the Citizens Advice Bureau, the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Public Accounts Committee and implement their recommendations for reform immediately.\" An investigation into the tax credit system is already underway after at least 13,000 civil servants had their identities hijacked by fraudsters. The stolen IDs were used to divert payments into criminals' bank accounts via an online claims system which was shut down in December. HMRC has admitted that up to \u00a315m could have been lost in the scam. Its executive director, David Varney, told MPs last month that it was still \"at a very early stage of knowing what the extent of this fraud is\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
