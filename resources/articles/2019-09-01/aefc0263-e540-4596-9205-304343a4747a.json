As the UN\u2019s chief, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned the 74th UN general assembly in New York that the world faced a \u201cgreat fracture\u201d, with the countries at risk of cleaving between the great powers of the US and China, Payne met the Chinese foreign affairs minister on the sidelines of the event for their second conversation in two months. Morrison \u2013 who has not been invited, post-election, to visit the Chinese capital \u2013 later told reporters that the Australian government welcomed the opportunity to talk to Beijing. He said he didn\u2019t see the conflict playing out between Washington and Beijing over trade, and the close alignment of his own language on China with Donald Trump\u2019s, as evidence of the looming fracture forecast by the UN chief. \u201cI am a lot more optimistic about it,\u201d the prime minister said. Rather than seeing the current global tensions as a \u201cgreat conquest of ideologies and belief systems\u201d, he said, it was more accurate to see it as a step change in the global economy, requiring some corrective actions. Global institutions, be they the World Trade Organization or the UN on climate change, had to be \u201crecalibrated to recognise that\u201d. He was unrepentant about redefining China\u2019s economic status as a \u201cnewly developed\u201d economy. \u201cWhen you look at the level of investment China makes in countries outside their own borders, when you look at the level of military expansion within their own ranks \u2013 they are not the actions of a developing country, they are the actions of the second largest economy in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cMoving into the next phase does mean ensuring that we are all playing on a level playing field.\u201d The US president used similar language in his address to the UN general assembly on Tuesday morning, also characterising China as a developed economy. Payne said she did not intend to go into details about Tuesday\u2019s conversation with her Chinese counterpart, including whether any concerns had been expressed about Morrison\u2019s foreign policy pivot this week at the Chicago Institute for Global Affairs, but \u201cit was a very positive meeting, as the prime minister said \u2013 my second meeting in the last two months\u201d. \u201cWe acknowledged our relationship is based on our comprehensive strategic partnership, and that\u2019s the premise from which we begin,\u201d Payne said. She also indicated she had raised human rights issues, including the persecution of Uighurs and the continuing detention of Zhou Yongjun. Morrison flatly rejected the idea that Australia had already picked a side \u2013 the US \u2013 in the rivalry between the world\u2019s great powers. He insisted that would be a \u201cflawed analysis of the situation\u201d. \u201cAmerica is our great ally,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cChina is our comprehensive strategic partner and we continue to maintain that this isn\u2019t a matter of choosing, it is a matter of working closely with both nations in the spirit of those histories and those relationships. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying for time now that I reject the binary narrative that keeps being thrust towards me on this. I don\u2019t buy it and I don\u2019t support it and I\u2019m not going to make decisions based on it. \u201cI think it is a very narrowcast analysis.\u201d In Australia, Morrison government ministers rephrased his characterisation, with the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, describing China has having \u201cdeveloped a long way from where they were\u201d and explaining Australia\u2019s engagement \u201creflects the new development status\u201d. Labor\u2019s shadow finance minister Katy Gallagher said Birmingham had \u201c[refused] to back in \u2026 his prime minister\u2019s language used around this matter\u201d. Gallagher said Labor\u2019s view is China is a developing economy but said it was unhelpful \u201cto be arguing about two words when we have such a significant relationship with China\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
