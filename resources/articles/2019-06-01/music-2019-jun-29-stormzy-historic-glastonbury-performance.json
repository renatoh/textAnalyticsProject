The Grammy-award winning singer Adele said on Instagram: \u201cI\u2019m so proud of him, Stormzy just monumentally headlined Glastonbury in his own right with one album!! The first Grime artist ever to do so, you respected everyone that opened the door for you whilst opening a huge one yourself.\u201d Stormzy, whose real name is Michael Omari, has experienced a phenomenal rise to fame since the release of his song Shut Up in 2015 and the album Gang Signs and Prayer in 2017. Among the highlights of the show, were a performance by the BAME dance group Ballet Black and guest appearances by the rappers Dave and Fredo and Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin. Stormzy also played a speech by the Labour MP David Lammy on the disproportionate number of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in the criminal justice system. Lammy praised Stormzy for using his headline spot \u201cto speak about the injustice of young black kids being criminalised in a biased and disproportionate justice system. Humbled and inspired that he sampled my speech.\u201d The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, described the performance as political and iconic. \u201cIt won\u2019t just go down in Glastonbury history \u2013 it\u2019ll go down in our country\u2019s cultural history.\u201d Stormzy has previously been credited with pushing grime into the mainstream. Wiley, a British rapper who is often cited as the \u201cgodfather of grime\u201d, praised Stormzy\u2019s stardom and said he\u2019d \u201cnever seen anyone reach these heights as quick as Stormzy has done\u201d. Ed Sheeran, whose 2017 hit Shape of You was performed by Stormzy on Friday, said the rapper was \u201can inspiration\u201d. He posted: \u201cFirst black British solo artist to headline Glastonbury, second youngest to ever headline, and just an inspiration to so many. This is just the start, congrats big Mike, looking forward to see you do more achievements like this.\u201d The Game of Thrones actor Jacob Anderson, who made a surprise appearance under his musician\u2019s name of Raleigh Ritchie, said Stormzy was \u201can icon\u201d. \u201cYou won at life tonight brother. Proud isn\u2019t the word. It was an honour to be a part of such a special moment,\u201d he added. At one point Stormzy held his mic out for the crowd to rap the line \u201cfuck the government, fuck Boris\u201d from his No 1 single Vossi Bop, before asking his DJ to replay the line. Praise was also showered on Tara Asher, who is one of four British language interpreters in the UK who specialises in grime, for her work signing the performance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
