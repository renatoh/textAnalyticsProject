Social workers did not take effective action even after Lucy McHugh\u2019s school flagged up their concerns that she had an older boyfriend who could be sexually exploiting her, the review concluded. The review, overseen by the Southampton Safeguarding Children Partnership, also found that police ought to have delved deeper when they learned that Lucy\u2019s killer, Stephen Nicholson, 26, who had a history of violence, was tattooing children. Nicholson, a care worker and lodger at the teenager\u2019s home in Southampton, was jailed for at least 33 years for murdering Lucy. He lured her into woods near her home in Hampshire in July 2018 and stabbed her 27 times before hiding the weapon and trying to burn the clothes he had been wearing. His trial at Winchester crown court heard that Lucy\u2019s school had raised concerns that she was spending time unsupervised with an older man. The trial judge, Mrs Justice May, questioned why social services had not intervened. The review found that agencies including children\u2019s social care were aware of Nicholson\u2019s criminal history. A \u201clearning report\u201d produced by the reviewers said the concerns correctly raised by her school did not progress further than the \u201cfront door\u201d to the Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub. The report said this \u201cresulted in no multi-agency sharing of information held by police, the school and children\u2019s social care.\u201d It added: \u201cThe referrals needed to be treated as one of child protection. If this had happened, a strategy discussion could have been convened concerning the risk this man posed. This did not happen and was a missed opportunity.\u201d The report said a lack of \u201cprofessional curiosity\u201d was a frequent theme emerging in such cases. It said in this instance there was \u201ca lack of further investigation by police\u201d when Nicholson came to their attention before Lucy\u2019s death, \u201cnot least when it became known he was tattooing underage young people\u201d. It added: \u201cBy not following up on the concerns expressed about this man, an opportunity was missed to consider the risks he presented to [Lucy] and other young people.\u201d Of Nicholson, it said: \u201cHe was well known and appeared to be well liked and trusted in the local community. This man was, however, also well known to police, and children\u2019s social care did have knowledge of elements of his background. Before being sentenced to life imprisonment, the perpetrator had numerous previous convictions, which included theft, battery, criminal damage, domestic violence and possession of cannabis.\u201d The report acknowledged that as a result of Lucy\u2019s murder, \u201ca number of partner agencies have changed procedures to enhance the way in which children are safeguarded\u201d. Supt Kelly Whiting, Hampshire police\u2019s district commander for Southampton, said the force was \u201c\u2018identifying improvements\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are already developing a trauma informed approach to dealing with all incidents involving children.\u201d Rob Henderson, Southampton city council\u2019s executive director for wellbeing (children and learning), said: \u201cOn behalf of the council I would like to apologise to the victim\u2019s family, friends, and all who knew her, for the council\u2019s shortcomings identified in the report. We have already made changes in a number of the areas highlighted.\u201d Nobody at the city council has been disciplined over the case. A spokesperson said: \u201cOur focus has been on learning and changing the way we operate when dealing with highly complex cases such as this.\u201d Hampshire police said no disciplinary action had been taken."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
