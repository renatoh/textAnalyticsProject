The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) launched a fresh investigation on Friday into whether Govia Thameslink Railway and Northern breached contractual requirements by failing to do what they could to provide \u201cappropriate, accurate and timely information\u201d before the changes to the train timetable and during the disruption that followed. Thousands of trains were cancelled or ran seriously late in the wake of the rescheduling of Northern and GTR\u2019s Thameslink and Great Northern services, with chaotic scenes at some stations where passengers complained that information on screens failed to match online information or the reality of trains on the tracks. An interim report by the ORR into the timetable debacle was published last month and was heavily critical of the Department for Transport and Network Rail as well as the train operators, finding that \u201cnobody took charge\u201d even as it became clear there would be trouble with the rescheduling. The ORR said that its inquiry, led by chairman Stephen Glaister, had also \u201cidentified concerns\u201d with information provided to passengers. The regulator said GTR and Northern could have breached licence conditions requiring them to provide sufficient information for passengers \u201cto plan and make their journeys with a reasonable degree of assurance, including when there is disruption\u201d. However, it said that opening its investigation, which should conclude by the end of next month, did not imply it had evidence of non-compliance by either company. The passenger watchdog, Transport Focus, welcomed the investigation. Its chief executive, Anthony Smith, said: \u201cPassengers were badly let down when new timetables descended into chaos on some Govia Thameslink and Northern routes. One thing that would have helped passengers work around these problems was accurate, timely and useful information \u2013 but in many cases that was not provided.\u201c Any fines could potentially be up to 10% of the companies\u2019 turnover, although an ORR spokeswoman said they would be \u201cproportionate\u201d, or well below that ceiling. A GTR spokesperson said: \u201cWe will cooperate fully with the ORR\u2019s investigation.\u201d A Northern spokesperson said: \u201cWe are truly sorry for the inconvenience passengers experienced as a result of the May timetable change. The ORR\u2019s own Glaister inquiry found that the root cause of the May timetable disruption was delays to new infrastructure, which did not leave enough time to train our drivers on the new routes and types of train.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
