The boxers had been due to fight on 5 May in Las Vegas but \u00c1lvarez withdrew after he was given a six-month suspension by the Nevada State Athletic Commission in connection with a pair of failed drug tests in February. The bout will be a sequel to last year\u2019s controversial draw at Las Vegas\u2019s T-Mobile Arena. \u00c1lvarez\u2019s longtime promoter, Oscar De La Hoya, announced the news on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m happy to inform that we have a fight September 15,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. It had initially appeared the 15 September fight would fall through after Golovkin\u2019s camp did not reply to an offer from De La Hoya\u2019s Golden Boy Promotions earlier in the day. However, a revised offer proved acceptable to both parties. Golovkin\u2019s last fight came against Vanes Martirosyan, whom he beat on 5 May in a bout arranged after \u00c1lvarez\u2019s withdrawal. \u00c1lvarez has maintained he did not take banned substances deliberately. \u201cI am truly shocked about what has happened and for those who have doubts and suspicions about my integrity I have always been and always will be clean fighter,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to apologize to HBO, Tecate and Hennessy and all my other sponsors, the media and to everyone who is involved in the promotion of this event and especially to the fans. I respect this sport. I will always be a clean fighter.\u201d Golovkin, for his part, called his opponent a cheat earlier this year. \u201cAgain with Mexican meat? Come on,\u201d Golovkin said. \u201cI told you, it\u2019s not Mexican meat,\u201d Golovkin added. \u201cThis is Canelo. This is his team. This is his promotion ... Canelo is cheating. They\u2019re using these drugs, and everybody is just trying to pretend it\u2019s not happening.\u201d Golovkin and \u00c1lvarez\u2019s first fight sold 1.3m pay-per-views in the United States and generated a live gate of more than $27m, the third-highest in boxing history. Golovkin is the unbeaten WBA, WBC and IBF middleweight champion. \u00c1lavrez holds The Ring middleweight title."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
