I think. Kirsten times Anderson over point for four, then dabs a single to midwicket to take South Africa to 398 for 1. I've got a headache. See you tomorrow. 90th over: South Africa 392-1 (Smith 177, Kirsten 21) And that, heaven be praised, is that. Giles finishes off a miserable England day by conceding just a single and South Africa will starts tomorrow - weather permitting - on 392 for 1. Hang on! There's going to be another over! Would you give it credence?! 89th over: South Africa 391-1 (Smith 176, Kirsten 21) Anderson continues and Kirsten punches him efficiently past point for three. Anderson almost sneaks a swinging yorker through Smith's defences, but he's seeing the ball like a melon, as they say, and jabs down on it just in time. Mercifully, there's just one over of this madness to go. The humour really is gallows now. \"I'm off for a six-month round the world trip tomorrow,\" writes Jonathan McCauley Oliver. \"Do you think South Africa will still be batting on my return?\" We'll keep you posted on their progress, Jon. 88th over: South Africa 387-1 (Smith 175, Kirsten 18) Gough will have two overs to work his magic, but his first ball is whipped through midwicket as Smith uses his big frame to generate real power. That's one of his shots. Two overs to go and the emails have dried up. Come on! Where's your enthusiasm? 87th over: South Africa 381-1 (Smith 169, Kirsten 18) Back comes Anderson and back comes the full-toss: Kirsten helps himself to four through the covers. This might well be Anderson's worst day yet for England. Venkat's pestering him about running on the wicket too, and he's already had one warning. 86th over: South Africa 375-1 (Smith 169, Kirsten 12) Smith works Flintoff through mid-on for four, then eases him through the covers on the up - classy shot, that. \"Thanks for the empathy Joe,\" writes Shehzad Charania. \"It would have helped though if you had got my gender right though.\" 85th over: South Africa 367-1 (Smith 161, Kirsten 12) Harmison bangs it in short to Kirsten, who can just sway harmlessly out of the way. \"Well I'm off for a long weekend in Groningen, now,\" brags Rob Cottrell. \"Do you think South Africa will still be batting when I come back?\" Yes, I do as it happens, Rob. Because according to the forecasts, it's going to rain. 84th over: South Africa 366-1 (Smith 160, Kirsten 12) Flintoff is preferred to Gough and Anderson, which is fair enough on the evidence of the day. But it isn't a good over: Kirsten tucks him through square-leg for four, then works him through midwicket for two next ball. Typical Kirsten shots, those: ugly but effective. Rather like Dan Rookwood on the dance floor. 83rd over: South Africa 359-1 (Smith 159, Kirsten 6) England take the new ball, and hand it to Harmison. But he doesn't get his line right to the two left-handers and there are some easy singles to be had off the pads. \"Will disastrous day one spark the inevitable tabloid frenzy for Nasser's head?\" wonders a mischievous Richard Marsden. \"That his part-time gentle off-spinning successor should take the only wicket of an otherwise atrocious day's play does have a certain ring of destiny about it.\" It probably will, Dicky. That's what the tabloids are there for. Aarrgh! We're back out. Eight overs to go. Bear with me. Rain! We're saved! Off they go, with South Africa 356 for 1 off 82 overs. What a day it's been for South Africa. Written off after the one-day series, and without their best batsman Jacques Kallis, they have ground England into the Birmingham dust. It has been an absolute hammering. And I've loved every minute. Splutter. 82nd over: South Africa 356-1 (Smith 157, Kirsten 5) Giles mixes up his pace, but to no avail. \"It's times like this we need Martin McCague and Peter Martin,\" writes the possibly insane William Thompson. 81st over: South Africa 353-1 (Smith 156, Kirsten 3) Smith moves to 150 with a tuck for two to leg, then spanks a Vaughan full-toss through wide mid-on for four. James Bridgeman writes: \"With us not being able to see the action, could you let us know if it's a truly dire bowling performance from England, or is it superb batting on a good wicket? Or is it both? Just how badly are we playing?\" We've bowled badly, James, until the last half hour, and we've dropped out half-chances (three of them, I reckon). But South Africa have batted superbly. 80th over: South Africa 346-1 (Smith 149, Kirsten 3) More consolidation from South Africa. Just one off that Giles over. \"How many emails do you get a minute?\" wonders Jon Graves. \"And how do you decide which ones to read?\" We reckon we get about 400 in a two-hour session, Jon. But we can only use about 30 of them - one per over, whenever possible. The selection process can be a little haphazard... 79th over: South Africa 345-1 (Smith 148, Kirsten 3) Vaughan continues and South Africa have gone into their shells. Relatively speaking. \"I wouldn't go as far as Ed (\"ten-pin variety\"),\" writes fellow South African Andre Kitshoff, \"but you guys should remember that about six hours back, everybody regarded England as the favourites, so don't write off your boys so soon. But I must say, it is always amusing!\" Glad you think so, Andre. 78th over: South Africa 344-1 (Smith 147, Kirsten 3) Giles is making the ball spit and turn out of the rough to Smith, but with the score 300-and-lots for 1, there's only team who will be pleased about that. \"Typical,\" fumes David Williams. \"This is possibly the most boring time for sport in the whole year - I have been looking forward to the opening day of the first test and look what happens. You might as well go home Lawrence.\" I just tried, David. But security caught me trying to leave the building and frogmarched me back to my desk. Scott Murray was not a happy man when he reaslised I'd tried to do a bunk. 77th over: South Africa 342-1 (Smith 146, Kirsten 2) Another tidy over from Vaughan, which isn't something I've been able to write much today. Just two off it. You get the feeling South Africa will look to bat out the day and start afresh tomorrow with nine wickets in hand. \"You can reassure Shehzad that she's not the only one with a hard-to-pronounce non-English name watching your commentary,\" writes Joe Vaitilingam. \"She's also dead right re children's programmes thread's chris tavare like in their dullness...\" I think I know what you mean, Joe. 76th over: South Africa 340-1 (Smith 145, Kirsten 1) Now that Gary Kirsten is in, expect the run-rate to slow somewhat. This is just what we need. Bludgeoned to death by Gibbs, then bored to death by Kirsten. \"Just an idle query but are scoreboards designed to accommodate four-digit totals?\" asks Simeon Goulden. WICKET! I KID YE NOT! Gibbs c Butcher b Vaughan 179 (338-1) Gibbs tries to mow Vaughan out of the ground over midwicket, but he doesn't get hold of it and Butcher is waiting on the boundary. England are back in this game. I predict a victory by tea on Saturday. \"What's an English name by the way?\" asks John Bull (well, Jon Bileby, actually). \"Jon - short for Jonathan is of Hebrew origin, so do I count? Anyway, What's in a name, Shehzad? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\" Good grief. 74th over: South Africa 337-0 (Smith 143, Gibbs 179) You have to admire the remorselessness of these two. Trescothick would probably have given it away by now. But Smith is a very tough piece of biltong. Three off that over from Giles. \"Cheer up,\" urges Martin Luce. \"I bet it ends in a draw.\" You might be right, Martin, but there's nothing like a good moan to blow away the cobwebs, is there? 73rd over: South Africa 334-0 (Smith 141, Gibbs 178) Vaughan isn't finding much turn here, but at least he keeps Gibbs quiet in that over. Only 17 overs of this torture to go. \"What a shame Andy Caddick is injured,\" writes Robert Cottrell. \"This is exactly the sort of situation Andy Caddick would have relished.\" Hmm. 72nd over: South Africa 333-0 (Smith 140, Gibbs 178) Trescothick has a small fracture on the tip of his little finger, which just about sums things up. Giles is actually bowling quite well here, and he's even going round the wicket to the right-handed Gibbs, who is looking to attack at every opportunity. Sure enough, he goes inside-out to lift Giles over cover for four as South Africa move to Graham Gooch's 333. 71st over: South Africa 327-0 (Smith 139, Gibbs 173) Just four off that over from Vaughan. Scott Murray is now cheering on South Africa. A ray of sunshine from a South African reader. \"Can I just say that it far too early for you lot to get downhearted,\" says Ed Johnson, whose natural pessimism makes a him a more natural Englishman. \"Have you seen what we call, rather laughably, our 'bowling attack'? Hah. They'd be better trying their hand at the ten-pin variety than Test bowling, believe me.\" I'll remind you of that when England are 100 for 5 on Saturday, Ed. 70th over: South Africa 323-0 (Smith 135, Gibbs 173) Giles has gone the way of most professional sportsmen and put blond streaks in his hair. It doesn't appear to have helped his bowling. Meanwhile, some Irish sympathy from Ronan MacLochlainn. \"I was just beginning to feel sympathy towards England's plight,\" he mocks, \"but then I remembered the Great Famine and many other injustices and suddenly the world seems a happier place.\" 69th over: South Africa 321-0 (Smith 133, Gibbs 173) Smith uses his feet to get to the pitch and drive Vaughan pleasantly through midwicket for four. Shot! \"I've just found out the best first-wicket partnership in Test-match history is 413 made in 1955,\" points out Ian Renwick. \"Any odds on this being beaten? Not being defeatist, or anything...\" I'd say there's a fair chance, Ian. Good grief, it really is that bad. 68th over: South Africa 316-0 (Smith 129, Gibbs 172) Gibbs is using a premeditated paddle shot very well to work Giles to fine leg - that one brings him two more. Giles is getting some turn, but mainly into the left-handed Smith, who has to contend with a small patch of rough outside his off stump. Jon Graves has a cunning plan. \"Maybe if we change loyalties and support SA they will start doing badly,\" he suggests. \"A long shot I know but it's getting to that stage.\" Come on South Africa! Go the Boks! Do it for the veldt! Let's see if that works. 67th over: South Africa 314-0 (Smith 129, Gibbs 170) On comes Michael Vaughan to purvey his loopy, quizzical offspin. South Africa milk him for five runs. Here's Shehzad Charania. \"Can we please not talk about kids programmes? In fact, I'm sure we've talked about this topic before on a similar dismal cricketing day. How about something like ... why there are only \"English\" names contributing to your reports?\" I've had a hard day, Shehzad. But that probably takes the biscuit. 66th over: South Africa 309-0 (Smith 128, Gibbs 166) Giles has Smith absolutely stone-cold plumb lbw but umpire Hair shakes his head. It was a full-length delivery that hits Smith on the ankle in front of middle as he aims to the leg side. Astonishingly, Hair says no. 65th over: South Africa 306-0 (Smith lots, Gibbs even more) Trescothick has been taken to hospital for a precautionary x-ray on his finger. Gibbs cracks Harmison for four more. My computer crashes. 64th over: South Africa 302-0 (Smith 125, Gibbs 162) Smith drives Gough through point for four, then brings up the South African 300 with a work for four through midwicket. Poor Goughie doesn't look the Test bowler he once was. He can still do it at one-day level, where he knows he'll only have to bowl 10 overs in a day, but he seems short of incision here. Events at Edgbaston are starting to get you down. Here's Andrew Goldsby. \"Why do we ever expect any better of them? The moment we get our hopes up they're crushed in a shower of slapdash bowling, poor fielding and no doubt soft dismissals to follow. Every [expletive deleted] year. Sigh. You know if it hadn't have been for watching Botham at Headingley on telly as a kid I probably never would had the slightest interest in cricket. Why couldn't I just go out and play what possessed me to watch? A few hours pleasure and a lifetime of suffering to pay for it.\" I know the feeling, Andrew. 63rd over: South Africa 292-0 (Smith 116, Gibbs 161) There's more bad news for England which is that Marcus Trescothick hasn't emerged after tea. He hurt his finger in the slips during the afternoon session and has been replaced by James Tredwell, a 21-year-old offspinner from Kent. As soon as I know whether Trescothick is badly hurt or not, I'll let you know, moments before hurling myself off Blackfriars bridge. Incidentally, the only runs off that over were a back-foot push for three into the covers by Smith off Harmison. John Wright speaks for a lot of you when he points out the following: \"I'm afraid Mark Cosker need to be corrected. Mr Benn lived at 52 Festive Road.\" And let that be the end of the matter. 62nd over: South Africa 289-0 (Smith 113, Gibbs 161) Smith works Gough through square-leg for four, and England are facing the very real prospect of walking off the field to a scoreboard of 400 for 0. It's so bad, it's funny. Just nine runs off that over. On an altogether different note, here's Tom Aldred. \"I think we should be worried,\" he informs us. \"I heard Governor of the Bank of England speak at a conference on Monday where he stated his belief that Graeme Hick was one of the greatest cricketers ever to play in this country. How can this man be trusted to make decisions affecting the lives of millions of people?\" Makes me shudder, Tom. It really does. 61st over: South Africa 280-0 (Smith 108, Gibbs 157) Harmison gets fingertips to a tough caught-and-bowled chance off Gibbs, but that would have been superhuman by anyone's standards, let alone an unathletic beanpole of a man who earlier in the day let the ball dribble through his legs for four. Maybe I'm being harsh. Maybe I'm just too irritated by the whole thing. I've been stoically trying to ignore all the emails about favourite kids programmes (as well as casting evil glares at Dan for saddling me with this particular theme), but I've given up. Here's Lee Kelly. \"Since the subject before tea seemed to be kid's TV, my wife Kate won't forgive me if I didn't bring up \"Jamie and the Magic Torch,\" the merest mention of which prompts her to sing the theme tune.\" 60th over: South Africa 280-0 (Smith 108, Gibbs 157) Gough takes up the attack but is immediately hit through the covers by Gibbs, who is now doing as he pleases. \"Is this the worst day's play by an England team ever?\" wonders Ian Pugh. \"Takes me back to some of the hammerings we got from the Aussies in 1989 when they seemed to bat for days without losing a wicket.\" Yes, it's up there, Ian. So much for England starting as favourites. 59th over: South Africa 274-0 (Smith 107, Gibbs 152) England's only hope is take five wickets in this session and keep the runs down. They get off to a bad start when Gibbs goes down the track to Harmison - that's right, to Harmison - and creams him through extra cover for four sumptuous runs. Whatever you might say about the match situation - and there's been plenty of colourful opinions voiced in the Guardian office so far today - they have played superbly. To confirm as much, Gibbs creams Harmison over cover off the front foot for four more to move to 150. That was astonishing!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
