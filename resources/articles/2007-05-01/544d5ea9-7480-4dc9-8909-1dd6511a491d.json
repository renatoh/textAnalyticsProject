Rather like its victim's career. After the Mail on Sunday won the right, last week, to publish some of the accusations of Jeff Chevalier, Lord Browne's vengeful ex-boyfriend, it seemed worth waiting until Sunday before passing judgment on its annihilation of the (former) BP chief executive. After all, there had been every reason for the same newspaper to publish the Tracey Temple diaries, which exposed our deputy prime minister as a work-based sexual predator, unfit for his office. Maybe John Browne had done something equally - in an oily kind of way - compromising, or disagreeable? And, in his quiet way, he had. \"John smoked Epicure No 2 cigars, at \u00a320 each, four times a day,\" announced one of the most prominent pull-quotes last Sunday, halfway through a six-page special entitled \"Downfall of the Sun King\". Epicures, indeed! Even though there is no evidence that the cigars were bought with profits that should have gone to poor, widowed shareholders, that hardly justifies this ostentatious smoking choice, when a perfectly good Petit Robusto may be had for as little as \u00a39.50. Or was it the Mail on Sunday's contention that a public figure in Browne's position should be expected to cut down, from four cigars, to three, one, or even no cigars a day? Hard to say. With, as it quickly emerged, no stories of significant business impropriety to justify the claims of public interest, nor any political story to tell, nor any gruesome personal habits to expose (which would have, at least, justified the paper's cover price to members of the homophobic community), the MoS reporter, Dennis Rice, was reduced to applying Associated Newspapers' default-malignity to Chevalier's unpromising and, in large part, actively contradictory memoirs. If Browne vacuumed up his business perks, then, as Chevalier complains, Browne was never off duty: \"John has few friends who are not affiliated with him in a business sense.\" Extraordinarily, much of the piece that brought Browne down could be read as a tribute to his generosity, in happier times: \"For my birthday John would usually try to find a good 1979 vintage - the year of my birth.\" Obviously, you don't get to be head of BP by being a lovely person. The Mail on Sunday has some fun with Browne's strutty issues around airline seats, and a hot-tub snap of fellow bankers and their (swimsuited, female) companions broiling in plutocrat soup evokes a passing shudder of distaste; but have pity on Rice, as he struggles to portray hospitality as a vice. \"I was made comfortable in all the homes by the staff and by John,\" Chevalier tells Rice. \"When I broke a rock crystal wine glass that had cost over \u00a32,000 I was not made to feel bad about it.\" But still, eh? Bloody show-off. Why didn't Browne have the manly decency to buy cheaper wine glasses, to make Chevalier feel at home? \"Since everything around me cost so much,\" records Chevalier, \"I could not help but feel out of place, despite assurances.\" Important people just added to the toll on Chevalier's health. \"Billionaires remembered me, but I did not remember them.\" Everywhere, he complains, celebrities, royals, politicians and \"countless other notables\" would insist on saying hello. Even at the Cipriani swimming pool in Venice the couple were stalked by Jude Law and Sienna Miller. \"It was stressful for me as I could not relax around a pool where everyone knew everyone and would constantly interrupt our relaxation.\" And at home repose was hard to find, what with the famous dinner guests, and Browne's insistence on time-keeping. \"John was scrupulous about when these meals began and ended ... \" Obsessive compulsive, do you reckon, or just faintly weird? Or a gay thing? Whatever: lighten up. Urging Browne's sympathisers to take a harder line, the MOS declared: \"If Jeff Chevalier had been a Latvian call girl no one would have had a shred of sympathy for Lord Browne.\" Really? If the Mail on Sunday is equally interested in rich heterosexual targets it is obviously fantastic news for embittered Latvians, but so far as most sympathisers are concerned, the Latvian-led invasion of Browne's privacy would, given this nugatory level of public interest, be just as unjustifiable, and his resistance equally comprehensible. A few months ago, in his Cudlipp lecture, Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers, raised \"an issue that should deeply worry all those who believe in press freedom\". British judges, he said, \"are itching to bring in a privacy law by the back door\". And, using the Human Rights Act, they had already started. \"Indeed,\" declared Dacre, \"had you told me 36 years ago that a cuckolded husband didn't have the right to speak about his wife's adultery, that a paper would be banned from referring to royal indiscretions contained in a round-robin journal distributed to scores of people and that the media cannot reveal the identity of a Labour ex-education minister who sends her child to private school - three issues that have come up recently on the privacy front - I would have simply disbelieved you.\" On the other hand, if you had told him, 36 years ago, that British judges would sanction a newspaper's persecution of a successful single man, purely because he had fallen for a man from an escort agency, Dacre would no doubt have thought it quite right too. For once, in these rights-ridden times, he has a lovely privacy invasion to celebrate. But if next time the judges side, secretively, with the quarry, whose fault will it be? \u00b7 This week Catherine saw The Lives of Others: \"A surpassingly good film even if surviving members of the Stasi don't deserve being depicted as capable of benign agency. It's a story, after all, not a documentary.\" She also went to see Comedy4Kids: \"A stand-up show for under 12s, much of it about poo and wee. Funnier than you would expect.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
