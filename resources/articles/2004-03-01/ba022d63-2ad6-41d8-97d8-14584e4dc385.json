The New York Yankees are at home to the Chicago White Sox on April 9, 10 &amp; 11. Friday's game starts at 4.05pm and the other two start at 1.05pm. To buy tickets, go to yankees.com and you will be redirected to ticketmaster.com where you can choose the ticket(s) of your choice. Prices range from $8-$95. The bleachers can be fun (if a little raucous) and cheap, but I prefer the loge seats along the third base line. These work out at $43.70 including fees and charges and can be picked up before the game at the international will-call office on the south side of the ground. The New York Mets are at home to the Atlanta Braves on April 12; the game starts at 1.10pm. To buy tickets, go to mets.com and the site deals with you directly. The tickets are posted to you at your home address, usually in plenty of time (although you will be pushing it now - call 010 718 507 8499 to make sure). Seats vary from $16-$53, $33 in the loge reserved section (with fees, charges and shipping, $36). Disabled access tickets are available for both grounds. Go early (about one and a half hours) before any of the games and you can usually see all the stars taking batting practice, and you can wander round the ground to take in the atmosphere. Because of security concerns backpacks and other large objects are not allowed in. Keep in mind that April in New York can be cold, so be prepared. Austin Baird Deborah Knuth is looking for vegetarian restaurants in Venice. The wonderful La Zucca (The Pumpkin) in San Giacomo del l'Orio in the Santa Croce district (041 524 1570) was originally a purely vegetarian menu although recently it has begun offering meat dishes. Mushroom and radish lasagne and a fabulous pumpkin tart are notable starters, while the main course is made up of a number of smaller, tapas-style dishes such as potatoes baked with taleggio, curried carrots with yoghurt and leeks with gorgonzola. Of the puddings, the chocolate mousse is outstanding. It is very reasonably priced - for two, with wine, we payed around \u20ac70, and the service was excellent. Book ahead though or you won't get a table. It is marked on the main city map in Lonely Planet but give yourself plenty of time to find it in those narrow, maze-like streets. Rob Cross Although vegetarianism remains a mystery to many Venetians, there are places to get a sustaining, not too expensive meal. The Antica Sacrestia near San Marco in the Calle della Sacrestia (Castello 30122) is one of our favourites. The vegetarian set menu is very filling: one or two courses is sufficient - we can recommend the roasted vegetables for a starter, and there are good pizzas. You need to get there early, though, as it is much frequented by locals and soon fills up. Another alternative is the very good self-service, Chat Qui Rit, on the other side of Piazza San Marco. Freda &amp; Bob Costa My advice for eating and drinking in Venice is to do it standing at the bar and to order what Venetians would have. This especially applies to enjoying lunch or 'pre-dinner' snacks and drinks. Many places do not obviously offer what we might recognise as a bar -for example it is always worth asking bread shops or pasticcerie selling nifty small cakes and canapes whether they will also serve you a prosecco or still table wine to have with it. This will be a fraction of the price and much more enjoyable than sitting at a cafe table and ordering a beer and a packet of peanuts. The best guide to identifying possible bars and eateries is Venezia Osteria E Dintorni by Michela Scibilia, which is widely available in the city bookshops, and is now published in English. It includes an extensive glossary of local dialect terminologies for specialities - fascinating in its own right - and is a boon for the vegetarian. Mike Tooby J Jones and family are going to Orlando, Florida, and would prefer not to hire a car. Some hotels on International Drive run shuttles to the parks - check with yours if they do. Otherwise, there's the local Lynx buses which may take about an hour to get there, or the Mears Transportation service which can be expensive and needs to be booked in advance. There are plenty of shops and restaurants around International Drive, so you don't necessarily need a car for that. But, in our experience, with children it's really best to get a car. Shop around on the internet. Also if you want a break from the parks -and you will -a car is essential to get to the Gulf coast beaches at Clearwater. Mick Pelc Paul Chamberlain wants to take his car by ship to the Baltic states. There are services from Germany to the Baltic states that are cheaper than going via Sweden (AAFT, February 6). The Kiel-Kla\u00ecpeda-Express (lisco.lt or scandlines.de) sails six times a week using modern 22-knot ferries. Other options are DFDS Tor Line (dfdstorline.lv) from L\u00fcbeck to Rigaand Vent-Lines (ventlines.lv) from Travem\u00fcnde to Ventspils in Latvia. Silja Line runs a service from Rostock to Tallinn (Estonia) twice weekly with the gas-turbine-powered Finnjet, but this is more expensive. A DFDS Tor Line service runs from Fredericia in Denmark to Kla\u00ecpeda, although this is basically a freight service with limited accommodation and facilities. The nearest UK served ports to the German Baltic coast are Cuxhaven and Esbjerg, served from Harwich by DFDS Seaways (xdfdsseaways.co.uk) but the Dutch ports of Hoek van Holland, Rotterdam and Ijmuiden are not too far away and the last two have services from northern England (stenaline.com, poferries.com). If you wish to go via Sweden, there are additional options to those mentioned. Tallink (tallink.se, all in Swedish unfortunately) operates daily from Stockholm to Tallinn (from April with the new cruise ferry Victoria) and from Kapellsk\u00e4r to Paldiski in Estonia (a cheaper alternative). Scandlines Amber Line (scandlines.dk) operates from Karlshamn to Liepaja (Latvia) and from Nyn\u00e4shamn (near Stockholm) to Ventspils (Latvia). Nick Widdows This weeks questions I am a single parent, desperate to go somewhere different with my 19 month old. Are there any adventure companies that welcome under fives? Sacha Tejani Travel guides often say turn up with a 'clean licence' for car rental. Will three points on a UK licence discount me from international car hire? Dai Bickham Where can I buy a radio that clearly picks up the World Service from South America, New Zealand and South East Asia without the annoying 'woooooweeee' noise and the fade in/out? Anne Webber Our family will be staying in the Doubs region of Franche-Comt\u00e9 this summer. Advice welcome on guide books, websites and things to do. Warren Brown I had a working holiday visa for Australia nine years ago. Does this preclude me getting one for New Zealand, and will I ever be able to get another one for Australia?
