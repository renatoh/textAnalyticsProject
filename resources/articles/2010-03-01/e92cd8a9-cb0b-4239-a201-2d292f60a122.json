The Red Knights, a group now numbering more than 60 wealthy United fans from around the world, are understood to believe that a more sensible valuation is around \u00a3800m. As Sir Alex Ferguson said this week he has no issue with the group, while pointing to his chief executive David Gill's insistence that the club was \"not for sale\", the Red Knights moved to quell talk of a \u00a31bn-plus bid. \"No specific discussions have been held in relation to the value of Manchester United and all numbers circulating in the media are purely speculation,\" said a spokesman. \"People are talking about putting their own money in and so are only going to do so if it's a fair and reasonable price \u2013 every penny over a fair price that goes to the Glazers in profit is less money that can be spent on putting the club on a sound financial footing after any takeover.\" Analysts have assumed that it will take a bid of around \u00a31.2bn to make the Glazers seriously consider selling the club, which carries debts of \u00a3716m if the \u00a3202m payment in kind loans that are secured on their shareholding are included in the total. One factor may be how much the Glazers have taken out of the club in the wake of the most recent bond issue, which made provision for up to \u00a395m to be passed on to their parent company to pay down their PIK debt. That will not be clear until quarterly accounts are released at the end of May. The Red Knights \u2013 who include the Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O'Neill, the influential hedge fund founder Paul Marshall and the Freshfields partner Mark Rawlinson \u2013 also plan to recruit further individuals prepared to contribute to a takeover bid. O'Neill, a former United director and a friend of Ferguson, spoke out against the club's \u00a3512m refinancing deal even though Goldman Sachs was part of a consortium of seven banks underwriting it. Ferguson has said that he has no problem with the green and gold protests against the Glazers or the embryonic takeover bid. \"I've no issue with the Red Knights. I know some of them, I'm quite friendly with a couple of them, and I don't deny them their right to protest,\" he said. \"If they want to try to buy the club, it's entirely up to them. I've always said that, when United became a plc way back, they were always going to be bought. I think people forget that point.\" But he added: \"David [Gill] summed it up when he said the club's not for sale, so what can anyone do?\" \"I have no problems with protests. I saw plenty of green and gold scarves at Wembley on Sunday, and I was delighted to see them supporting the club,\" he said. \"We're quite happy. As long as they're supporting Manchester United, they can wear what they bloody like!\" As the Red Knights begin working on the detail of their bid, they hope that the Manchester United Supporters Trust, which now has more than 115,000 members, can continue to build momentum. \"The intention is to provide the option to every United supporter to own a part of their club,\" a Trust spokesman. \"If the millions of supporters around the world choose to participate they will hold the majority stake.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
