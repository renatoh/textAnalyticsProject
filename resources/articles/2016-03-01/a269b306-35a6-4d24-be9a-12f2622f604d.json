In the past two weeks Olivier Giroud, Theo Walcott, Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Danny Welbeck have re-established an eye for goal, and the Arsenal manager is hoping that will make a difference during a pivotal week, with three competitions on the line. \u201cIt is a weight on the shoulders when the players don\u2019t score,\u201d he said. \u201cGiroud has cycles so it was a weight off his shoulders. Walcott too, and it\u2019s the same for Alexis as well who scored against Tottenham. He suffers maybe more than everybody when he doesn\u2019t score. \u201cFootball has to be instinctive somewhere and you have to play with freedom, when the goals are natural. Every striker will tell you that. Sometimes what you forget, when you get in the final third you have 0.1 to 0.2 seconds to make the right decision \u2013 in midfield you have one to two seconds to make a decision sometimes \u2013 and when you have a little hesitation, just a fraction short, when the ball gets there, decisiveness can go when you are not successful for a while. The speed of decision-making is linked a little bit with just that fraction of a second when you\u2019re truly in [tune with] what you do.\u201d Wenger is an admirer of the Watford front two of Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney. \u201cThey have a very good understanding between the strikers and the quality between our two centre-backs will be vital,\u201d he says, recalling how Ighalo and Deeney gave Arsenal \u201ca tough time\u201d when they met earlier in the season in the league. The pair left an impression on him, even though Arsenal ran out winners. This is a tricky week to prepare, with short recovery time and long distance travel between three challenging games. After Watford in the FA Cup on Sunday lunchtime, Arsenal travel to Barcelona for an assignment that looks like the longest of shots on Wednesday night, then back to Premier League action at Goodison Park with an early kick off on Saturday. Is the Everton game the most vital? \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cLet\u2019s see how Sunday goes. I haven\u2019t given up for Barcelona yet.\u201d The Premier League remains a major focus. \u201cThe players are not in the comfort zone and want to do well and they\u2019ve not given up,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cAt the moment it can look pretentious to say we are still in the fight but mentally we are. Now we need to keep focus and go as high as we can. We are not in the mode to finish just in the top four. That may be the case, but if we don\u2019t play well we won\u2019t even be in the top four. We want to continue to fight for a chance in the Premiership. \u201cI feel we can have a run but we know how quickly it can change \u2013 we lost two games and suddenly looked like we would be in the Championship next year so it is game by game and all we know is we can not afford any more slips-ups like we did against Swansea.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
