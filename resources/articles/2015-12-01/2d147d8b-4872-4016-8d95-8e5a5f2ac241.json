Wilson, speaking by phone from Austria during his directing of Verdi\u2019s La Traviata at the State Theatre of Linz, is assessing the greats of performance art and experimental theatre. He says Gaga\u2019s depth of feeling was clear as she sat or stood hours at a time while he shot a series of video portraits in London two years ago. Costumed and made up, Gaga struck poses drawn from paintings, such as Jacques-Louis David\u2019s neoclassic The Death of Marat and Jean Auguste-Dominique Ingres\u2019s Mademoiselle Caroline Rivi\u00e8re for Wilson\u2019s Living Rooms series, exhibited at the Louvre in Paris in November 2013. \u201cThe concentration, the power she has, it\u2019s total. Would Meryl Streep do that? Would Nicole Kidman? Can Madonna? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Wilson says. Later that year, at 4am in a recording studio, he had Gaga repeat text from Marquis de Sade like a mantra: Coitus, Christ, curses, ejaculation, always the same \u2026 \u201cThis kid speaks text like a machine gun,\u201d Wilson recalls. \u201cThe articulation, it was amazing. She should do Medea.\u201d The Texas-born Wilson, 74, has over the past half century teamed with many high-profile collaborators, including Tilda Swinton, Jim Jarmusch, Philip Glass, Mikhail Baryshnikov and the late German dramatist Heiner M\u00fcller. Wilson will travel to Australia in January to see Jette Steckel\u2019s 2010 Hamburg production of his adaptation of German dramatist Georg B\u00fcchner\u2019s Woyzeck for the first time, at Sydney festival, which Wilson premiered in Copenhagen in 2000, with music by Tom Waits and Waits\u2019s partner, Kathleen Brennan. He will also make a keynote speech on the topic of art festivals at Sydney\u2019s Opera House. Woyzeck is the story of a soldier who submits to a doctor\u2019s experiments, originally written by B\u00fcchner in 1836-37. Wilson\u2019s version updates the story to an abstract 21st century musical. He hasn\u2019t seen Steckel\u2019s new version \u2013 but even if he had, it\u2019s not in Wilson\u2019s nature to say what a work is meant to be about. Wilson has long been influenced by Bertolt Brecht\u2019s ideas of formalism and distance; an epic theatre where all elements \u2013 lights, movement, text, staging \u2013 are equally important. He eschews \u201cthe lie\u201d of naturalism on stage and sees artificiality as \u201cmore honest\u201d. Hence he was a perfect fit with Lady Gaga, herself a master of avant-garde showmanship. A few days after Wilson first met Gaga (aka Stefani Germanotta) in 2013, he says she called him for advice for her MTV awards opening number. \u201cShe said, \u2018Tell me something about theatre\u2019. I said, \u2018Well, you know, Gaga, think of the first second, and the last\u2019. \u2018OK, thank you, that\u2019s all I need to know\u2019. \u201cShe called again two weeks later. \u2018Bob, can you tell me something else about theatre?\u2019 I said, \u2018The Broadway formula is you start strong and end big\u2019.\u201d But security wouldn\u2019t permit Gaga\u2019s plan to be hoisted into the air above the audience with four drones in her dress. \u201cI said, \u2018Gaga. You\u2019ve spent a million and a half dollars on this; let\u2019s fight for it.\u2019 She said, \u2018No, no, we\u2019ll do it later, forget it.\u2019 \u201cSo instead, she starts with a close up, with a big collar. She looks like a nun. And they pull back, and she\u2019s in a white robe. And in three-and-a-half minutes, she changes everything five times, clothes, hair \u2026 At the end, she\u2019s totally nude, except for clamshells on her tits and her private parts. \u201cI said, \u2018Wow, Gaga, you learn fast. You started strong, you ended big! You got the first second, and the last!\u2019 She said, \u2018Well, thank you very much\u2019.\u201d In 1968, Wilson started the performance art group the Byrd Hoffman School of Birds in New York, named for the dance instructor who helped him overcome a childhood stutter, and involved street people and factory workers. Later, he would work with hyperactive and brain-damaged children in creating art. \u201cAny great work has to relate to the guy on the street,\u201d he says. Marlene Dietrich, whom Wilson also considers a performance artist, was an early influence. He recalls he was \u201cperhaps 27\u201d when he took the German-born actor and singer to dinner. She taught him the value of slow performing: in her case, slow and sexy singing. \u201cI said, \u2018Miss Dietrich, may I invite you for dinner?\u2019 She said, \u2018With pleasure\u2019. \u201cWell, I was terrified. A man came to the table and said, \u2018Miss Dietrich, you\u2019re so cold when you perform\u2019. And she said,\u201d \u2013 Wilson drops his tone \u2013 \u201c\u2018You didn\u2019t listen to my voice [...] The difficulty is to place the voice with the face.\u2019 It is true: she was icy cold with her movement, but the voice could be very hot and sexy. And that was her power.\u201d Wilson weighs up whose art will still be staged late in the 21st century. M\u00fcller will still be produced 50 years or more hence, he says, because his philosophical approach stands the test of time. But the performance art of Serbian-born, New York-based Marina Abramovi\u0107 will be \u201ca footnote\u201d, he says. In 2010 he took actor Sharon Stone to New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art to sit for 10 minutes opposite Abramovi\u0107, who clocked 700 hours sitting silently under bright lights, as one by one visitors took their turn in an opposite chair. \u201cSharon started crying,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cShe had a deep, emotional experience, because of Marina\u2019s depth of emotion.\u201d Wilson recalls his own New York art \u201chappenings\u201d of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, including plays he devised that lasted for a day or more. \u201cI think much of what my generation produced won\u2019t be seen 50 years from now. It wasn\u2019t meant to be. I don\u2019t think Marina\u2019s work will last. No, no way. \u201cShe\u2019ll have a place in history for having done something. She disagrees, but I don\u2019t think the work is meant to be reproduced. She\u2019ll have an influence.\u201d So to Wilson\u2019s take on Woyczek. Wilson says it is a masterpiece of \u201cclassical architecture\u201d; its greatness as indestructible as Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, or M\u00fcller\u2019s 1977 postmodernist take, Hamletmachine, which he says will live beyond the politics of its Hungarian revolution setting. Did the fact B\u00fcchner died at 23, in 1837, leaving only fragments of Woyzeck, give Wilson artistic freedom? \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated, because you can\u2019t rewrite a master. But you have to be careful not to become the slave.\u201d Wilson laments that theatre today tries to constantly sell, even enforce, direct messages. Writers should not pronounce what they think their play is about, because such pronouncements discourage multiple interpretations. \u201cIt is OK to get lost! You don\u2019t have to understand every second. I think that\u2019s the problem. Let the audience get lost. It\u2019s OK.\u201d Woyzeck is playing at Carriageworks 7-12 January as part of Sydney festival. Wilson\u2019s keynote speech Arts Festivals: The Long and Winding Road at the Sydney Opera House will take place on 6 January"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
