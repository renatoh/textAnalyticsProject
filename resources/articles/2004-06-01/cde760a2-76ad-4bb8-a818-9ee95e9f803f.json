'Recall the face of the poorest person you have seen,' he wrote, 'and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is going to be any use to them'. Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Chancellor, Gordon Brown, might usefully reflect on that principle as they finalise a spending round that will fix budget priorities for the next three years. By setting a course to double Britain's aid programme by 2010, the two men could help combat poverty and create a more just and stable world. But faced by intense inter-departmental rivalries and the spiralling costs of the war in Iraq, will they recall the faces of the poor - or, for that matter, the content of promises made by the Prime Minister? Three years ago, in a passionate speech to the Labour Party, Tony Blair pledged to help 'heal the scar' of African poverty. Now his Commission on Africa, on which Gordon Brown serves, has a remit to produce 'specific solutions' to the problem. It will report next spring. But failure to deliver major increases in aid now will fatally damage both the commission's credibility and the Prime Minister's efforts to position himself as a global leader in the war against poverty. That would be a grave setback for international poverty reduction efforts. Next year, Britain chairs the G8 summit. The event matters because it marks a last chance to mobilise the resources needed to achieve the millennium development goals - a compact between rich and poor nations to halve extreme poverty, reduce child deaths and achieve universal education by 2015. The British government has signalled that doubling development assistance will be at the core of its agenda. Practising what it peaches on the world stage would provide some much-needed leadership by good example. Without that leadership, the danger is that next year's summit will register as yet another of those vacuous, self-indulgent annual talking shops to which G8 leaders appear dangerously addicted. To be fair, this is a government that can point to some real achievements in aid. It has doubled spending since 1997 to about \u00a34 billion, restoring the deep cuts inflicted by successive Conservative governments. We also dedicate a bigger share of our national wealth to overcoming poverty. Today, we give just under 0.4 per cent of our gross national income in aid - double the share inherited from the Conservatives, but still less than when Mrs Thatcher entered office wielding the public-spending axe. On the international stage, Brown has been a more consistent advocate of development than any G8 counterpart. His proposed International Finance Facility is a bold and innovative attempt to mobilise new resources for poor countries through private capital markets. It merits support - but only as part of a wider strategy to reach the UN target of spending 0.7 per cent of our income on aid. Measured against this yardstick we are not a generous nation. Ten countries give more than us. And unlike G8 partners France and Canada the government has steadfastly refused to set a timetable for reaching the 0.7 per cent target. This has to change. The new spending round should prepare the ground for achieving the UN target by 2010. And Britain should then challenge its G8 partners to come to next year's summit armed with a similar commitment. Such a move would signal that Britain is serious about leading a G8 response to the greatest challenge facing the international community: the scourge of mass poverty. The challenge is at its starkest in Africa, where more than half the population survives on less than $1 (54p) a day. You don't need a high-level commission to work out that the region is losing the war on poverty. Only eight countries, representing less than 15 per cent of Africa's population, are on course to halve poverty by 2015. Preventable disease claims the lives of one in three children. Fewer than half of those that survive complete a basic education. Meanwhile, more than 28 million people are living with Aids. International aid, channelled through effective national poverty programmes, is one of the most potent weapons in the fight against poverty. It save lives, builds hope and creates the conditions for long-term growth. According to the Department for International Development, its aid programme lifts 2 million people out of poverty each year. British aid has helped Uganda turn the corner on Aids, put more than a million Kenyan children in school and sustain economic recovery in Mozambique and Tanzania. So why don't we do more? Endless excuses are churned out, spun to the media, and repeated as self-evident truths. Achieving the 0.7 per cent target by 2010, so the argument runs, is unrealistic and unaffordable. Oh really? In fact it would cost us about \u00a34bn annually - roughly the amount set aside to prosecute the war in Iraq, and rather less than the increase in defence spending in the last spending round. Of course, the headline numbers are large. But doubling the current aid budget would cost each of us \u00a31.20 a week - about the price of a cup of coffee. For an investment that could lift 10 million people out of poverty, combat the preventable diseases that cost children their lives and educate a new generation, this is small price to pay. If the political will is there, we can afford to reach the 0.7 per cent target. And in his dual role as Chancellor and advocate for Africa, Gordon Brown has to take responsibility for getting this message across loud and clear. None of which is to deny that bold leadership will be needed. The Conservatives will inevitably cite increased aid commitments as evidence of fiscal profligacy. Their own singular contribution to global poverty reduction is a proposed public spending freeze that would cut aid in real terms by some \u00a3200m - equivalent to total aid spending on Ethiopia, Mozambique and Zambia. Such a move would inspire little support. Opinion polls show that almost two-thirds of people see global poverty reduction as a more important public-spending priority than Iraq. What this reflects is not just a sense of moral duty, but the recognition that, in an interdependent world, we have a self-interest in tackling the poverty, injustice and extreme inequalities that threaten our shared security and prosperity. For Tony Blair, this is a public spending round with a difference. It is a moment that will shape his political legacy. Will he be remembered on the world stage for a bitterly contested war that divided his country and the world? Or will he be the leader that forged a new partnership between rich and poor nations, and delivered on a promise to heal the scar of poverty? \u00b7 Kevin Watkins is Oxfam's head of research"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
