Speaking with the TUC general secretary, John Monks, at a rally against the tube sell off, the London mayor said that his decision about whether to accept any revised government plan for the tube would depend entirely on Mr Kiley's assessment. His remarks follow suggestions that Tony Blair is considering whether to readmit Mr Livingstone to the Labour party if he accepts a modest rejigging of the government's scheme to split up the Underground and hand over stations, track and signalling to the private sector. Mr Livingstone said he welcomed such \"positive\" hints. \"But my future relationship with the party will not be determined by cosmetic changes to the government's public-private partnership plan, but by Bob Kiley's recommendation as to whether any new proposals will deliver a safe and efficient tube\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
