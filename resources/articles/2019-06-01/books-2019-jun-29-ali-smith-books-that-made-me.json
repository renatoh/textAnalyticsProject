The book that changed my life Toni Morrison\u2019s The Bluest Eye \u2013 but all of her writing does this every time \u2013 and her profound understanding of what books do and what they\u2019re for. The book I wish I\u2019d written This changes by the week, month, day. Right now it\u2019s Namwali Serpell\u2019s The Old Drift, her debut novel and a sprawling lifeforce, a history of Zambia partly told by mosquitoes. The book that influenced my writing Lewis Grassic Gibbon\u2019s 1930s north-east Scottish trilogy, Sunset Song, Cloud Howe and Grey Granite. Not only did he invent a sentence structure that works like breath through the body of the reader, and a kind of Scottish English that\u2019s simultaneously rich and spare, but these three novels taken together make a formally stunning and cunning work of art. The book that is most underrated Does it help to think of books in terms of ratings? If lots of people really love something, then that\u2019s great. If really good things get missed, then readers will find them eventually, because readers are indefatigable when it comes to the good. The writers I tend to remind people about, because I know the pleasure they\u2019ll get if they haven\u2019t yet read them, are the great Paul Bailey, the 1930s German writer Irmgard Keun, the new young Scottish writer Helen McClory and the mighty Helen Oyeyemi. The book that changed my mind It\u2019s not that it changed my mind, but that it freed my mind \u2013 Alasdair Gray\u2019s 1982, Janine. I was 19 or 20 when I heard him read from this. I bought it and read it and knew then that fiction could do anything. The last book that made me cry Lorenza Mazzetti\u2019s London Diaries, her memoir of coming to London from Italy in the chaos and brokenness of the years after the second world war, how she met both casual cruelty and unexpected kindnesses, and how a smattering of luck, bravado and good friendship forged the film-maker and artist she became. It transmits the terrible fracture and surreality of aftermath as only a real admirer of Kafka could. The last book that made me laugh Nicola Barker\u2019s I Am Sovereign, out next month. It\u2019s about someone selling a house, and it\u2019s about the human being as a home for the soul. It\u2019s one of the funniest, most finely achieved comic novels, even by her own standard, and I think it\u2019s a masterpiece. My earliest reading memory The Beatles\u2019 45 double A side \u201cShe\u2019s a Woman\u201d / \u201cI Feel Fine\u201d. I was quite small. I worked out the word \u201cBeatles\u201d, then \u201cthe\u201d, and then because I knew the songs I worked out which words were which. My comfort reading Anything/everything by Muriel Spark. She discomfits us with such pleasure, such merriment, then returns us, via this merry intelligence, to a place where we can take real comfort in things. The book I most often give as a gift Italo Calvino\u2019s Six Memos for the Next Millennium. I think it\u2019s one of the best books about writing ever written. The book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for I\u2019m quite happy to be forgotten, thank you. But the book I\u2019m happiest to have written so far is a novel called There But for The. \u2022 Spring by Ali Smith is published by Hamish Hamilton.
