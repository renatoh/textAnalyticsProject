When bags became big business in the 2000s, she created many of the accessories that made the big brands millions. She's one of the people who, with the beading and bobbles she stuck on her bags for Luella in the 2000s, is often credited with creating the It bag, the iconic fashion statement of our time, a highly decorated object of desire that changed seasonally, cost a month's salary, and often weighed an absolute tonne. Today, sitting in the sun-drenched yard of her east London studio, Hillier remembers those years with a dry fondness. \"I had this denim Fendi Baguette I'd covered with badges and key rings,\" she says, ponytail bobbing. \"At the same time, Giles Deacon at Bottega Veneta was reinventing what you could do with luxury fashion \u2013 taking this pure thing and fucking it up in beautiful ways. Until then, accessories had no\u2026 personality.\" That's what Hillier did best: personality. She gave names to bags then, adding 'hardware' (chains and buckles); she made them clink. You could hear them coming. \"Hardware was a way to add value. Then the price of gold rose and it began to disappear. When Phoebe Philo started at C\u00e9line [in 2008] she brought in a cleanness to design.\" The It bags Hillier now creates for Marc by Marc Jacobs, Victoria Beckham and Loewe have evolved. \"Hardware now seems gratuitous. We think more about the leather. If you're killing an animal, you ought to acknowledge the skin.\" She grew up in south London with her grandmother, a cleaner for the BBC, who she followed round the costume department, and her grandfather, who'd take her to a museum every day of the holidays. \"Which is where my love of collections comes from. I'd curate my bedroom: the displays on my rocking horse, my Madonna wall. I still collect stuff \u2013 shoes, brooches, things with rabbits on, bags\u2026\" In a tall room near her office, Muji storage boxes line the walls. They contain a fraction of her collections. Fifties box bags, Chanel purses, vintage leather cracking at the spine. This room, and her mood boards, with photos and notes like \"too normal\" on handle details, help put her work into context. \"It's not about me,\" she says of her work. \"There's more to success than ego.\" What is it about her, then, that led Victoria Beckham to her door? She ponders. \"She thinks I'm nice.\" In 2010, after being named Accessory Designer of the Year, Hillier launched her own label, a collection of fine jewellery she calls \"luxury with a wink\": little diamond-eyed rabbit doodles that look like they've been bent from 18ct-gold paper clips and nestle on the sternums of Britain's most fashionable ladies, including editor-in-chief of Love Katie Grand. \"I've known her forever,\" says Grand. \"She was one of my students at Harrow. I got into trouble for giving her 100% for her degree project. \" Hillier's new collection includes glow-in-the-dark ceramics, and those rabbits again, this time joined by a menagerie of other animals. \"Our customers are people who love fashion, but are a bit ironic with it,\" she explains. \"A bit girly, a bit quirky, a bit arty, a bit clever.\" A bit like her. \"I'd like the paper-clip rabbit to become iconic, but not as ubiquitous as, say, the Tiffany heart. It has to stay a bit secret.\" Why? \"So cool girls carry on wearing it.\" As the person behind the trend, how does she feel about the It bags? The way they Towie-fied, and climbed in price? Can you ever justify a \u00a328,000 handbag? \"It's all relative,\" she sighs. \"There will always be a customer who wants to buy one. And sometimes it's grotesque. But I understand if a skin is treated with respect. The term 'luxury' has changed. Now it's often just used to validate a price point.\" Does she still love the clinking bags of her early career? \"Yeah, you have to,\" she laughs. \"You have to love everything you make. I love it all.\" hillierlondon.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
