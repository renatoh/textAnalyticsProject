Germany's Oberwiesenthal is one such resort. The last snowfall was at the beginning of the month, but very low temperatures mean that the 130cm of snow on upper slopes is firmly staying put, leading to good boarding and snowing conditions. Mayrhofen in Austria is also doing well; a few more centimetres were recently added to the 104cm that could be found on the upper slopes and all lifts are open, but the real stars are stateside. The resort of Keystone in Colorado had a recent fall of 10cm and low temperatures are ensuring good conditions. Skiing is also good in Breckenridge and Vail. Deal of the week A week in M\u00e9ribel, France, can be had at a huge reduction from Ski Chalets. Accommodation is on a fully catered basis in the Chalet Carriaz, which sleeps up to seven people.
