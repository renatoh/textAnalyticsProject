The result is a greater choice of African safari at more affordable prices than ever before. Namibia Rainbow Tours is offering an all-inclusive seven-day camping safari in northern Namibia from \u00a3795 in groups of up to 16. Included are a visit to the Africat project at Okonjima, where cheetahs and leopards can be seen at close quarters as they are reintroduced into the wild; game viewing in Etosha national park, home to the black rhino; and a chance to meet the semi-nomadic people of the Himba village. The tour then continues west across the Namib desert to the Cape Cross seal colony before ending at the coastal town of Swakopmund, where a variety of activities are available. Accommodation is in high dome tents, and although there is a camp assistant, everyone is expected to help with chores. Rainbow Tours (020-7226 1004, rainbowtours.co.uk). Kenya From next summer, Guerba will be providing weekly safaris in Kenya - booking isn't essential, you can simply turn up at the designated meeting point and join the tour. The idea is aimed as much at the spontaneous backpacker already in the country as at Brits flicking through brochures at home. The camping safari is a seven-day journey by truck (the \"wildlife bus\") through the Masai Mara, one of the best nature reserves in the world - with flamingos, rhino and leopards all in the area - and includes a night spent with the Masai people in the remote Loita hills. The price is \u00a3408, exclusive of flights, and the meeting point - every Sunday 9am outside Nairobi's Panafric Hotel - is also the first stop for their Serengeti safari in Tanzania (\u00a3519) and their seven-day climb of Kilimanjaro (\u00a3909), meaning you can conveniently combine the tours for an extended trip. Groups will be a maximum of 22 people, including a tour leader, driver and cook. Guerba Wildlife Bus (01373 826611, wildlifebus.com). South Africa For those wanting fewer companions and greater comfort, safari lodges are definitely worth considering. Travel Butlers provides lodges in game parks across South Africa starting from \u00a334pp per night including meals and two game drives per day in 4x4 safari vehicles. While the real budget seeker may well be tempted by the popular self-drive safaris in national parks, the guides and trackers who take guests out are allowed to take their vehicles off-road to get closer to the wildlife. The options in South Africa are considerable; Kruger National Park alone is roughly the size of Wales, and home to hundreds of species of wild animals and birds, including the big five - elephant, lion, rhino, buffalo and leopard. Accommodation for self-drive safaris starts from \u00a316 per night, although car hire is extra. Travel Butlers (0845 8382450, travelbutlers.com). Botswana Phakawe Safaris provides some of the cheapest tours in Botswana, and offers a wide range of trips with relatively small groups (a maximum of seven). There are nine itineraries to choose from, lasting up to 11 days - all are US$149 per day, excluding flights - with custom-made tours available at additional cost. The cheapest is a three-day trip to the Okavango Delta, poling a dugout canoe through the channels and open lagoons while camping at night on deserted islands. The local guides will also take you on game walks, helping you track the local wildlife - hippos, elephants, giraffes, lions and crocodiles are all native to the area.
