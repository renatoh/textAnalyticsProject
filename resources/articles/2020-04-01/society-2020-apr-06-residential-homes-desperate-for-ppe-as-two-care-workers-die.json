Carol Jamabo, 56, a community carer for Cherish Elderly Care in Bury in Greater Manchester, died last Wednesday. Another carer died in a home run by MHA, the UK\u2019s largest charitable social care provider, which said it was unclear where she contracted the virus. The death of a West Dumbartonshire care worker that emerged on Sunday was also confirmed by the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. The fatalities came amid rising concern that those working in social care still do not have the protection they need amid the Covid-19 pandemic and that, without testing for the virus, staff risk contaminating care homes where elderly people are supposed to be \u201cshielded\u201d. Peter Kyle, the MP for Hove \u2013 which has about 30 care homes - said facilities were effectively being \u201cconverted into hospices\u201d because of a lack of protections. He said one home in his constituency had recorded 14 cases of coronavirus in residents aged over 75. In Scotland, at least 15 residents at the 90-capacity Burlington Court care home in Glasgow have died after displaying symptoms of the virus. They all had underlying health conditions and several were on \u201cend of life pathways\u201d, according to the care provider, Four Seasons. It declined to provide an update on further deaths, amid unconfirmed reports that several more residents were infected. Nadra Ahmed, the executive chair of the National Care Association, which represents small and medium-sized care providers, said: \u201cThe issue we hear most is: \u2018I am desperate for masks. Has anyone got any gloves? I am down to my last stock.\u2019 \u201cOnce you run out, it is a question of being down to Marigolds and bin liners. Government has not reacted quickly enough to build confidence in the sector that PPE [personal protective equipment] is available.\u201d Kent county council is so short of protection items that it has asked partner organisations and thousands of its staff to try to drum up supplies. It said on Monday it has made \u201cstrong representations\u201d to the government about shortages and has been promised deliveries, but believes these will not meet its needs. On 25 March, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was asked in parliament when all care home workers would get the protective equipment they needed and replied: \u201cBy the end of the week.\u201d Many in the care sector say this has not happened. Liz Kendall, Labour MP for Leicester West, said about one in three care homes in her constituency still had no PPE on Friday. \u201cWhile [chancellor] Rishi Sunak was right to say the NHS would get whatever resources it needs, the same has got to be true for social care because the two services are inextricably linked,\u201d she said. Care workers can use large quantities of PPE if they follow government guidance that \u2013 in care homes with suspected or confirmed Covid cases or on domestic visits to a shielded person \u2013 they should wear gloves, plastic apron, mask and possibly eye and face protection. Some care managers are going into debt to keep staff and residents safe. Anita Astle, the manager of the Wren Hall nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where nine residents are in isolation with suspected Covid-19, paid \u00a39,000 for a consignment of masks at \u00a32.74 each \u2013 five times the usual price \u2013 because government supplies were insufficient. \u201cThe first delivery [from the government supply] was 160 masks,\u201d she said. \u201cI told them we were using 312 a day. I waited four days and got 400. The supply chain is completely useless.\u201d Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA, said: \u201cPeople who work in the care sector are extraordinary individuals, each and every one of them, and I can\u2019t impress enough how important it is that we get testing and adequate levels of PPE to keep them and residents safe.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care said it had provided all care homes with 300 masks each and homes struggling can call a national supply disruption response team. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working around the clock to give the social care sector the equipment and support they need to tackle this outbreak. We have provided PPE equipment to over 26,000 care homes including home care providers and hospices across the country. \u201cThe full weight of the government is behind this effort and we are working closely with industry and the whole social care sector to make sure staff have the protection they need to continue to deliver care safely.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
