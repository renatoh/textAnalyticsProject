Yesterday there was the nasty spat with mayor Ken Livingstone, over a photograph of a Routemaster he said obscured advertisements about the bus's new heritage routes. Today comes a Standard story claiming that Channel 4 News reporter Katie Razzall fell off the back of a Routemaster on the 159 service while filming in Oxford Street. Only it wasn't Razzall, who is heavily pregnant and stuck in the studio today. It was her colleague Zoe Conway who took a tumble. Channel 4 News has been left bemused by the Standard report, while Transport for London is irritated that media organisations are not obeying its edict to seek written permission before filming on buses. New catchphrase wanted The search for a sign-off catchphrase for Mark Austin, to replace Sir Trevor McDonald's \"and finally...\" is gathering steam. Here are the leading contenders for you Mark: \"Night night sleep tight make sure the bugs don't bite\". Or how about, \"See ya, wouldn't want to be ya\" or \"See you next time, sleep well\". How about the authoritative, \"Get up them stairs\" or the Sound of Music angle, \"So long. Farewell. Auf Wiedersehen. Adieu.\" And finally, how about a British version of Ron Burgundy's sign-off in the film Anchorman, replacing \"Fuck you, San Diego!\" with \"Fuck you, Tunbridge Wells!\"? Roll up, roll up British Comedy Awards producer Michael Hurll is still shy of a pre- and after-show party event sponsor for next week's side-splitting bash. Mike's offering half-an-hour of exposure on ITV2 from 10.30pm, then another hour from 11.30pm. Come on, folks - 'tis the season of goodwill and suchlike, after all. And Monkey's fee for accepting this blatant plug will be given to charity, honest. Irish times Associated Newspapers in Ireland has found itself at the centre of a political storm after one of its former journalists, Frank Connolly, was accused publicly by a government minister of having links with the IRA. Earlier this week, justice minister Michael McDowell made the extraordinary claim in a written reply to a parliamentary question that Mr Connolly was involved in a plot to teach Farc rebels in Colombia how to use explosives and said Gardai intelligence had shown he had travelled to the country on a false passport and in the company of a senior IRA figure. Mr Connolly, who left Associated's Ireland on Sunday last year, says the claims - which have been aired by the media before - are \"false and malicious\" and part of a \"witch-hunt\" against him. The plot turned distinctly thicker when a new 'public investigations unit' set up by Mr Connolly lost its 800,000 euro a year in funding following McDowell's attack. Oh dear. Mr Connolly claims it's all a dark political plot against him with Tony O'Reilly's Independent newspapers as the co-conspirators. Three weeks ago the Irish Independent published a fascimile of the alleged false passport Mr Connolly used to travel to Colombia. Mr Connolly told the Irish Times yesterday that \"confidential Gardai investigation files were copied to Independent Newspapers to the damage of a citizen who is entitled to the presumption of innocence and to the protection of his good name\". Asked about the passport picture published by the Irish Independent, he said: \"That was not me.\" He added he would \"deal with all the issues\" when \"the DPP, if he ever does, decides to forward a case against me\". Sounds like a good story for Ireland on Sunday. Prize guy Another odd coincidence involving Richard Desmond and products being offered as prizes to readers of his publications. Following the furore over giving his son an Xbox in the same week a stash of them were being given away in a competition to readers, staff at OK! magazine were intrigued to learn that editor Lisa Palta's bonus this year from Desmond consisted of a branded Mini as a reward for her hard work. If she wasn't sure what it looked like, Lisa could always check out the ones being offered in a competition to readers of OK!. Women trouble John Leslie (remember him) is back on TV ... BBC3 to be precise, in new show, My Childhood. The former This Morning presenter - who the BBC says is now a \"successful property developer\" - says that two years on from the Ulrika Jonsson debacle and tabloid pictures of him allegedly snorting cocaine, he is \"still struggling to maintain any lasting relationships with women\". On the show, due out on January 8, he asks: \"Why haven't I settled down? Does my attitude need to be addressed in terms of is there some sort of psychological area that's not right?\" Ulrika, Abi ... over to you. December 8 Unlucky numbers 'Tis the season to be axing staff and selling off local newspapers. So it's small wonder that Northcliffe staff were a little concerned about the headline It Could Be You on the staff intranet. Was the headline referring to the dozens of staff awaiting P45s under the company's \"Aim Higher\"/pre-sell off redundancy programme? Or, as turned out to be the case, just a new feature about the lottery on the newspaper group's website? Thrashing out the issues There must be something in the studio air of More4's The Last Word. Under the cerebral control of Dr David Starkey, the guests were chatting civilly about the new restrictions on giving children a good, old-fashioned wallop now and then when - swipe me! - Labour MP Austin Mitchell suddenly announces that, given sufficient provocation, he thinks nothing of delivering a well-deserved hiding. Or as he put it, with shaken fist accompaniment: \"I have on occasion been driven desperate by the [kids'] bloodymindedness and given the grandchilden a good belt.\" As the studio erupted, he added a little tardily: \"Not publicly, not publicly.\" Beware the hate machine The Independent's Middle Eastern correspondent Robert Fisk has entered the American language, according to the Toronto Star. Right-wing bloggers have taken to referring to \"being fisked\" - the deconstruction of one of his pieces of reportage critical of US policy in Afghanistan and the Middle East. If it's meant to bug him, it doesn't. \"I don't use the Internet. I've never seen a blog in my life. I don't even use email,\" he says. \"I don't waste my time with this. I am not interested. I couldn't care less. I think the Internet has become a hate machine for a lot of people and I want nothing to do with it.\" Loop hole at the watering hole Does BBC stand for Booze Bonanza Corporation? Monkey only asks as attendees at BBC training courses at Wood Norton last week were amazed to be greeted in the evening by signs on the door of the much loved Phoenix bar declaring that owing to \"problems with the licence\", no alcohol could be sold. Undaunted, the thirsty BBC staff wandered into the bar anyway. Their persistence was rewarded when they discovered that a \"cock-up\" by a solicitor meant that beer was not for sale, but, joy of joys, it was being given away. The net result, licence fee payers will be delighted to hear, was a large number of trainees were unable to get much done the following morning. The theory among teaching staff is the free booze is part of a plan to soften them up for the rumoured privatisation of BBC Training. Monkey imagines it wasn't what Mark Thompson imagined when he said the BBC needed a \"self-help\" plan to win a new charter. Has Lewis's luck changed? The spirit of the late John Thaw was much in evidence at yesterday's screening of the eagerly-awaited follow-up to Inspector Morse, Lewis. The drama sees the eponymous Morse side-kick return to ITV in January for a new instalment. After a break following the death of Morse, and his wife, the beleaguered Lewis returns to Oxford. As if he hadn't had enough bad luck, in one of the opening scenes, he's almost run over by an old burgundy Jaguar, similar to Morse's. Lewis does a double-take at the driver but then sees it's a woman. Kevin Whately, who plays Lewis, joked yesterday that if Thaw was still alive, he wouldn't have got away so lightly, saying: \"John would have definitely run me over!\" Girls, girls, girls Yesterday's teaser in the Sun (see below) hinting that it knew someone was gay turned into a spectacular Sapphic carnivale today splashed all over (where else?) Page 3. The paper's revelation is that topless models Becky, 24, from London and Melanie, 23, from Morecambe, have fallen for each other. As the paper says: \"The gorgeous pair are the first in Page 3's 35-year history to fall for another topless babe.\" Hey, that's totally forgetting about 1980s Page 3 babe Sam Fox, who came out years ago, albeit with an ordinary mortal and not a Page 3 stunna. Anyway, the story of Becky and Mel will run and run. The love birds (geddit?) are going to the Maldives for New Year's Eve to (what else?) swim naked with dolphins. December 7 Purpose-built, spacious flat. Must be seen A doleful-sounding note from Rupert Murdoch's young Chinese wife, Wendi Deng as a buyer had been found for their $28m Manhattan apartment. The 9,300 sq ft triplex loft was designed (money no object) by Christian Liaigre and, apart from the usual amenities, offers a screening room, a gym and an enclosed sunroom which Rupert used as a reading room. \"Everything was expensively done because we thought we would be here forever,\" sighs Wendi, a plaintive cry that may ring bells with many who have worked for Rupert. Unlike them, however, Wendi (with Rupert, natch) is moving up - actually, into a Fifth Avenue den costing $44m. Paxo crumbles on camera As unlikely TV phenomena go, it's up there with Gordon Ramsay not swearing and a Big Brother contestant saying something interesting. Yes, Jeremy Paxman in tears. The Newsnight presenter broke down while researching his family history for BBC2 genealogy hit, Who Do You Think You Are?. Paxo, the undisputed hard man of TV news, came over all emotional when he discovered that his great, great, great grandmother was a charlady living in poverty in Glasgow, and had died of TB and exhaustion in her 30s. \"Hundreds, thousands of people must have died like this,\" said Paxo. \"I don't know these people. I wouldn't know them if I fell over them.\" You might not be surprised to hear that the Newsnight man was deeply sceptical about taking part in the show - declaring that \"most TV is rubbish\" - but by the end of it he had been convinced otherwise. But don't expect him to be taking part in Celebrity Big Brother just yet. History repeating The eminent Tudor historian Dr David Starkey, who this week took over the hot seat just vacated by Stanley Johnson on More4's The Last Word, must have thought it was a piece of cake after watching Stan's seamless performance. Not so, as he found out after the first commercial break when - zounds! god's teeth! - instead of a new segment popping onto the screen viewers were treated to a replay of the first, complete with his carefully-wrought introduction. This went on for some four minutes until somebody must have woken up the operator. Viewers were then treated to a lengthy view of the More4 logo (which was rather more of More4 than we wanted). Still, it enlivened the fag end of an evening. Especially when the credits rolled and there - forsooth! - we saw that the presenter all along had been \"Sir David Starkey\". An instant, on-air knightood? Old Stan must have been apoplectic with envy. (PS Well done, Objective Productions!) The Sun's latest outing The Sun wants us to know that it knows something that we don't. The paper devotes most of page three (except the part with the naked woman on it) to detailing Robbie Williams' libel win after media claims he is gay. But what caught Monkey's eye was an intriguing footnote. \"PSST ... we know someone who is gay. See tomorrow's Sun\". Is the red top about to out someone? Not necessarily. Remember back in 2002 when Pop Idol winner Will Young came out in the News of the World? Sun editor Rebekah Wade, then in charge of the Sunday, got the story after phoning up Will's agent and asking if she could be of any assistance after hearing that the Mail on Sunday was pressuring the star for an interview. The Sun loves poking fun at gays, but we'll all find out tomorrow if La Wade has retained her sympathetic touch. December 6 Indy's aunty auctioned A rather odd offering in the Independent's annual auction - Lot 36: AGONY CORNER. It offers a dinner with agony aunt Virginia Ironside during which she will \"talk through your problems with you and restore your broken heart\". Odd, considering that Ironside has gone on record recently to declare therapy a waste of time. There's also an odd amendment to this lot: it is \"subject to Virginia Ironside's agreement in relation to location\". Hearing voices Strictly Come Dancing is down to the last four couples (what do you mean you haven't been watching?) and Monkey wonders if the excitement isn't getting to the production team. Monkey only mentions this after they forgot to turn one of the backstage microphones down during the last instalment, and a voice could clearly be heard whispering: \"James! James!\" before describing judge Craig Revel Horwood as a \"bloody nice chap\". Lucky they were being complimentary, eh fellas? But whose was the mystery voice? It could have been Zoe Ball, possibly Camilla whassername, but our money's on co-host Tess Daly. Come on - own up. Never heard of him David Cameron may be all over the media today but he has not always been so prominent. In Ray Snoddy's book Greenfingers, about former Carlton boss Michael Green, there are no mentions of the new Conservative party leader, who was at that time head of PR at ... Carlton. Was this because Snoddy felt about Cameron much as the Sun's Ian King or just that Ray never felt he needed to call Carlton's press office? Talking yourself out of a job If BBC1 boss Peter Fincham still had any illusions about the perils traditional channels such as his own face from personal video recorders, he was put straight in no uncertain way at today's winter/spring launch for the network. Hollywood Reporter hack Mimi Turner wanted to know his views on BBC/HBO drama co-pro Rome. Not my responsibility, guv, was the gist of his answer - it's a BBC2 show, after all. Turner's recovery was commendably swift - she always watches Rome on her Sky+, see, so doesn't know which network it was on. \"Channels are a thing of the past anyway,\" she added dismissively. Might as well resign now, eh Peter? Poor old Des Five weeks in, and Des Lynam still isn't looking entirely comfortable in the Countdown hotseat. Not out of place, you'll understand, just not his usual self. \"I think Des is very brave to do it,\" says co-host Carol Vorderman, leaping to Des's defence in today's London Evening Standard. \"He's settling in, though he's had his problems. I take the mickey out of him something dreadful.\" How's that, Carol? \"I tell him that his moustache looks stuck on.\" Haha! \"It's a culture shock for him, having bossy women in the studio.\" Must be a culture shock after all those years with the football lads. December 5 What's in a name? Obviously, journos can't be too careful about they describe things in these super-sensitive times. So when the US president's wife, Laura Bush, led reporters on a visit to the White House to view the seasonal decorations, one reporter, eyeing the 18ft Carolina fir draped with glittering orbs, asked tentatively if it was all right to call it a Christmas tree. Certainly, replied the first lady, adding for further clarification: \"At this season, we know Americans celebrate in many different ways. We've always had a Christmas tree.\" Bigmouth strikes again On the day that Tory leadership favourite David Cameron has been revealed as a distant cousin of the Queen, a Newsnight feature on the anointed one will feature the revelation that his favourite album is The Queen is Dead, by The Smiths. Oh, the irony! But before Republicans get excited, the boy David goes on to say that he doesn't like the sentiments behind the record. Perhaps not surprising, really, given the following snippet of Morrissey's lyric: \"And so, I checked all the registered historical facts, And I was shocked into shame to discover, How I'm the 18th pale descendant, Of some old queen or other.\" Statistically speaking The BBC's ministry of silly statistics has been working overtime of late. Hot on the heels of the humdinger that BBC radio fans have consumed the equivalent of 15,345 years of listening online this year, MOSS has today unveiled another statistical corker. Apparently, BBC2's social experiment programme Making Slough Happy has increased the happiness of its target group of volunteers by 33%. Not to be outdone, Monkey confidently predicts that, if you totted up the height of all the lazy diary hacks turning the Making Slough Happy release into a story, the resulting figure would be: at least 3ft 6ins. Sun lays into Cameron Conservative party leader in waiting David Cameron is a \"poisonous, slippery individual\" the Sun's business editor Ian King tells us today, recalling the time Cameron was PR man for \"the world's worst TV company\" Carlton in the 1990s. \"He was a smarmy bully who regularly threatened journalists who dared to write anything negative about Carlton - which was nearly all of us,\" recalled King, who pours scorn on Cameron's claims that he was a company executive. \"No, he wasn't. He was a mouthpiece for that company's charmless chairman Michael Green, who operated him the way Keith Harris works Orville.\" Okay, Ian, now tell us what you really think Finking positively Monkey never misses former Conservative guru Danny Finkelstein's footie column in the Times, the Fink Tank. And you can't fail to notice a bizarre pattern to some of its headlines. November 26: \"Vastly over-rated\". November 12: \"Mediocrity\". November 5: \"Truly bad\". October 1: \"Over-valued\", and September 1: \"Fool's Gold\". Is some subliminal message being imparted by Times subs, or is Finkelstein the naturally negative type? Come on fellas. What about a \"marvellous\", or even \"so much better than last week\"? More festive cheer To the Express and Daily Star Christmas do at Tantra in London's Soho. True to the name of the bar, Richard Desmond delivered a speech that went on. And on. Eschewing a traditional Christmas message (\"it's better to give away free CD covermounts than it is to receive\"), Desmond offered an analysis of newspaper circulations over the past year. Overall sales were down 10m, he said, and the Star and Express were down too. Oh. But here's the good news - other newspapers were losing sales even faster! It is the sort of festive message guaranteed to give Express staff a spring in their step - and rush to take back their Christmas presents and invest the money in a cash ISA instead. Russian winter in Essex Staff at Big Brother producer Endemol are preparing a special meal for chief creative officer Peter Bazalgette, who said he would \"eat his hat\" if spoof reality series Space Cadets ever made it on to the screen. It was promptly commissioned by Channel 4. But the production suffered an early glitch after contestants nearly spotted Canary Wharf from their plane just as it was about to land in \"southern Russia\". We only hope they haven't spotted the lorry bearing the legend \"Dave Butcher, Kelvedon, Essex\", which was clearly visible during Monkey's visit to the set. Can't help but feel it might give the game away. BBC on the oche Monkey's number of the week: 38. The amount BBC2 controller Roly Keating managed with six darts at an arrers themed BBC Christmas drinks. BBC director of sport Roger Mosey had clearly been practising - he managed an almighty, er, 62. Apparently they're very good at cribbage. Not universally popular Not everyone is happy with the appointment of former Trinity Mirror chief executive Philip Graf as deputy chairman of Ofcom. Not least at the BBC, where Graf has previous, forcing it to cut back on its frothier website efforts in his review for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. \"What does a regional newspaper business executive know about TV programmes and editorial issues?\" harrumphed one senior industry figure. \"Doesn't it say rather a lot about Ofcom's business skew?\" More turkeys at ITV Poor Simon Shaps, and it's not often we get to say that. The ITV director of TV copped most of the flak at last week's Royal Television Society review of the year, the price for such acclaimed fare as Celebrity Love Island, Celebrity Wrestling, and Rock Around the Block. The evening ended with Sky Networks' managing director Dawn Airey throwing a frozen turkey at him. But don't worry - the turkey wasn't hurt. Now for some good news Martyn Lewis good news corner: Darren Hercher's triumph at last weekend's Grierson awards marked a turnaround for the film-maker. He was desperate and on the dole for 18 months when he borrowed a camera, collected his Giro cheque (a princely \u00a3107.90) and asked a total stranger to \"Send Me Somewhere Special\". The resulting film of the same name, made by Fulcrum TV, won best newcomer and earned him a commission from BBC4 controller Janice Hadlow. Enterprise can pay off. Number crunching Monkey's nonsensical stat of the week comes from the BBC. \"More than 134m hours of BBC Radio have been consumed via the internet this year - the equivalent to 15,345 years of continuous listening.\" By which time the licence fee would cost, oh, Monkey's calculator has broken."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
