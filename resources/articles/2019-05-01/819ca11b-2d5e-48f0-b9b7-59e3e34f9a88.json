Instead of being \u201cactually executed for sodomy\u201d in 1859, as the writer claims in Outrages, Thomas Silver was apparently \u201cparoled two years after being convicted\u201d. Silver, who was 14 when he was convicted, is just one of several cases cited in the book but, according to the writer and broadcaster Matthew Sweet, the error stems from a simple misreading of a historical record and raises wider questions about the argument Wolf puts forward. In Outrages, which was published by Virago, Wolf examines the effect of 19th-century legal changes on the lives of Victorian poets such as John Addington Symonds and argues that the Obscene Publications Act of 1857 marked a turning point in the treatment of gay people. \u201cPeople widely believe that the last executions for sodomy were in 1830,\u201d Wolf told the Observer. \u201cBut I read every Old Bailey record throughout the 19th century, so I know that not only did they continue; they got worse.\u201d According to Sweet, who first challenged Wolf on Radio 3\u2019s Arts and Ideas, her error concerning Silver stems from a misunderstanding of \u201cthe very precise historical legal term, \u2018death recorded\u2019, as evidence of execution, when in fact it indicates the opposite\u201d. The historian Richard Ward agreed, adding that the term was a legal device first introduced in 1823. \u201cIt empowered the trial judge to abstain from formally pronouncing a sentence of death upon a capital convict in cases where the judge intended to recommend the offender for a pardon from the death sentence. In the vast majority (almost certainly all) of the cases marked \u2018death recorded\u2019, the offender would not have been executed.\u201d Wolf has committed a \u201cpretty basic error\u201d, Ward added. \u201cIf all the people who were mentioned in the Old Bailey records as \u2018death recorded\u2019 were subsequently executed, there would have been a bloodbath on the gallows,\u201d Ward said, \u201cyet anyone who has a basic knowledge of crime and justice in the 19th century would know that that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d While Wolf only quotes the \u201cdeath recorded\u201d verdict in Silver\u2019s case, Sweet challenges the wider argument put forward in Outrages. \u201cI think her assumptions about \u2018death recorded\u2019 have led her to the view \u2026 that \u2018dozens and dozens\u2019 of Victorian men were executed, and that one of the main subjects of her book, the poet John Addington Symonds, grew up with the fear of execution hanging over his head. I have yet to see evidence that one man in Victorian Britain was executed for sodomy.\u201d Wolf\u2019s argument that 1857 saw a brutal turn against consensual sex between men runs counter to most scholars, Sweet continued, who suggest that it was only in 1885 that a less tolerant legal climate developed. \u201cShe argues that historians have misread this moment and we should see that 1857 was a more significant date. I think she is wrong.\u201d Wolf said she appreciated Sweet\u2019s \u201cimportant correction\u201d, but rejected the idea that it challenged the main thrust of her book. \u201cOutrages doesn\u2019t purport to be a comprehensive database of eventual sentences served for sodomy,\u201d she explained. \u201cIts focus is on the reception of news about laws and sentences by a group of friends, as well as eventual arrests of friends of Symonds.\u201d The book tells the story of how Symonds absorbed information about increasingly long sentences of hard labour and reports of death sentences in the national media, Wolf said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it takes many reports of a death sentence for a 14-year-old for sodomy, though later commuted, to really scare a 19-year-old gay man. This fear is the focus of my book.\u201d Wolf says she \u201ccorrected the error right away, and asked my publishers to include the correction in the book; and I thanked Dr Sweet both one to one and in public\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
