The short answer was General Motors, the manufacturer of the first, limited-availability, lease-only electric car: the EV1. The longer answer would include the oil companies that stood to lose over time the greatest resource-monopoly in history; the deadwood managers at Detroit's Big Three, whose inability to think forward even in the medium-term left American suburbs and freeways choked with Escalades and Hummers that chugged gasoline to the tune of 10 miles to the gallon; and a consumer mindset that wasn't yet ready for the idea. The movie ended with the recall by GM of all the vehicles, whose leasees had come to love them. All the cars were crushed. It was a depressing story well told by director Chris Paine. It reminded me of the broad outlines of the infamous (ooh, there's that name again \u2026 ) General Motors streetcar conspiracy, which involved General Motors, the Firestone Tire Company and others buying over 100 municipal streetcar operators in cities across America in the postwar years and replacing them with buses, which would naturally be manufactured, maintained and replaced by GM, and shod by Firestone, over many decades. Whereas the streetcar conspiracy was never satisfactorily proven, the extermination of the EV1 happened right in front of Paine's eyes and camera. Six years later and, boy, don't things change? Paine has a sequel, Revenge Of The Electric Car, and there has been a more or less complete turnaround in the auto industry over electric cars. Toyota's Prius is everywhere on the freeways (Japanese manufacturers think differently), Elon Musk's Tesla car company is limping towards success, and even big bad GM has unveiled its Volt for mass consumption. This time around, Paine isn't standing outside GM HQ, forbidden to enter, Roger &amp; Me-style; he's actually in the building and at the GM proving grounds with charismatic GM exec Bob Lutz. Musk's rollercoaster fortunes are examined, as are those of Nissan chieftain Carlos Ghosn, who's prepared to swan-dive into the electric market with his mass-produced Leaf EV. At GM much of this is the result of the boardroom enema forcibly administered to the company by the US government as one condition of its massive 2009 auto bailouts. Elsewhere, the notion of the electric car has found its moment. Some critics have complained that Paine has changed sides and become a corporate cheerleader in the new movie. Nonsense: he still just wants more electric cars. With all their misfortunes and intermittent investment crises, the small-time outfits in the movie prove that \u2013 like it or not \u2013 gigantic corporations are needed if it's to happen at all; even if they have to be browbeaten into action by a government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
