Her show sets out to resolve it. By the end of a set conspicuously constructed for emotional catharsis, she\u2019s done so \u2013 even if it requires a sleight of hand you barely notice till you\u2019re halfway home. Harouni pulls off with supreme smoothness and control an autobiographical hour on her Staten Island upbringing and on the road accident that almost paralysed her for life. You could wish for more liveness or looseness in your comedy \u2013 and that might come later now that Harouni\u2019s got this precision-engineered debut under her belt. She\u2019s UK-based, but the show is set in New York, among her \u201cboring Sopranos\u201d family. She brings the community vividly to life, and there\u2019s a \u201cparents say the funniest things\u201d vibe \u2013 complicated just a little by dad\u2019s Republicanism and Janine spending her teens attending anti-abortion marches. There\u2019s a fine punchline to the latter memory, and good gags throughout, not least the running one about her boyfriend\u2019s over-compensating remark about menstrual blood. But soon the show takes a harsher turn, as Harouni is nearly killed in a car crash and told she may never walk again. One striking image \u2013 in a show that shines with filial love \u2013 finds dad drawing crosses in holy water on her wounded leg. The injury and recuperation material sits a little at odds with the slick, smiling style of Harouni\u2019s comedy. Her conclusion elides dad\u2019s homophobia and his wider politics, as if fixing one (with thanks to a gay-best-friend character from central casting) absolves the rest. But if it sometimes feels facile, it\u2019s performed with warmth and skill by a newcomer who\u2019s clearly going places. At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August.
