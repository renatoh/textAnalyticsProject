A series of high-profile peers, thought to include the Government's adviser on health, Lord Winston, and the senior Labour Party figure and multimillionaire, Lord Alli, are expected to speak against an outright ban when the issue is debated in the Lords tomorrow. Baroness Jay, the Leader of the Lords, and Baroness Hayman, the Agriculture Minister, have already said they do not agree with stopping hunting in Britain. The Labour peers will argue that rather than a ban the Government should agree to a 'middle-way' option where hunts are given statutory regulation and are more closely controlled. They have given firm pledges to hunt supporters that they will vote against the ban in the Lords on 26 March. The pro-hunting Countryside Alliance is delighted that so many high-profile Labour members will vote against a ban, saying that it reveals that the issue is not one of Labour versus the Tories. The strength of Labour feeling against the ban is also expected to strengthen calls within Downing Street that Blair should compromise on the issue. The peers will join Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, David Blunkett, the Education Secretary, Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, and John Reid, the Northern Ireland Secretary, who all support the middle-way option. The alliance said that it was important that 'modern- thinking' peers such as Alli and the broadcaster, Lord Bragg, were standing up and saying that the Government was wrong. The Lords debate is expected to give the strongest indication yet that Blair's desire to ban hunting is running into the sand. More than 80 peers have said they want to speak during the debate, with the vast majority taking up positions against a ban. Although the Bill has little chance of becoming law before the general election - and no chance if the general election is held as expected on 3 May - the peers' actions will give a boost to the pro-hunting lobby, which is seeking to persuade the Prime Minister to drop the pledge from the party manifesto. Senior party sources said that such a move was unlikely, as it would anger many backbenchers. 'I think what will happen will be that the direct link between having a free vote and banning hunting will not be made so strongly,' said one backbench MP. 'Last time the literature had the pledge up against pictures of foxes. The implication was clear, we want to ban hunting. 'Actually what we are saying is that we will allow a free vote for all Members of Parliament. It is up to them to decide. As a party we don't actually have to have an opinion on it. So there will far fewer pictures of foxes this time around.' There are increasing signs that Blair wants to find a way to neutralise the issue. Although he said during a BBC Question Time programme in 1999 that he still agreed with a ban, some Downing Street officials are concerned that the Government is setting up an unnecessary confrontation with country interests. When the issue was last voted on in the Commons last January, the Prime Minister was absent. Last week John Jackson, the chairman of the alliance, was invited to see Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff and one of the most influential people in the Government, at No 10 where there was discussion of a possible compromise. Although Richard Burge, the chief executive of the alliance, ruled out any softening of the alliance's position on only agreeing to voluntary regulation, he admitted that there would have to be discussions on any proposals that were put on the table 'in the fullness of time'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
