Gilou has grave doubts about the increasingly fragile Laure\u2019s methods and fitness for duty. Trust is breaking down within both the police and the judicial hierarchy, and there\u2019s a strong sense that their somewhat sluggish investigation is being outflanked at every turn by the nimble yet far-reaching criminal conspiracy. The scene is set for a double bill that, in trademark Spiral style, is both darkly ambiguous and bleakly satisfying. Phil Harrison Strictly Come Dancing 7pm, BBC One A sickness bug almost derailed week six of the dancing contest-slash-divorce incubator, but the show went on, with a half-baked Halloween theme and a shock elimination. As fans continue to pile on Shirley Ballas for letting Mike through, could there be another controversial exit? Hannah J Davies Great Australian Railway Journeys 8pm, BBC Two Michael Portillo\u2019s working holiday continues. His crossing of Australia enables transportation treats ranging from a ride on the world\u2019s steepest railway to an epic journey on the world\u2019s longest one. There\u2019s a smattering of history, too, as he investigates the origins of Sydney. PH Great British Car Journeys 8pm, Channel 4 This soothing travelogue is powered by the genuine bonhomie between Peter Davison and Christopher Timothy as they pootle round the UK in a gorgeous 1936 Morgan. A run north from Axmouth along the Fosse Way wraps up season two, with a vintage driving test en route. Graeme Virtue Scott &amp; Shackleton\u2019s Antarctic Adventure 8.30pm, Channel 5 Rob Bell heads to Dundee to hop aboard the Royal Research Ship Discovery, the vessel that took Scott and Shackleton through the ice floes of Antarctica. Access to primary sources helps Bell explain how the project started and how engineering innovations made success a possibility. Jack Seale Pose 9.45pm, BBC Two After an intense opening to season two, this episode feels like light relief. An odd sort of light relief, however, as a fatal accident tests Elektra. Meanwhile, Angel wants to be \u201cthe fresh face of 1990\u201d, but will Lil Papi be collateral damage? Less essential than season one, this is still an enjoyable mix of shiny surfaces and hidden depths. PH Film choice Queen of Katwe 3.30pm, BBC Two This Disney tale of a poor kid making good is lifted out of the ordinary by winning performances, Mira Nair\u2019s vivid direction, and sheer charm. Madina Nalwanga is Phiona Mutesi, born in the Ugandan shantytown of Katwe, and bidding to become a chess champion; Lupita Nyong\u2019o is her ferocious mother.
