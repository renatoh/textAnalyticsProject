Child Genius (Channel 4) began last night, a long-term project to follow 10 of the little bleeders as they grow up, and the best decision the documentary-makers made was to kick off with a gentle, 90-minute-long introduction to the 10. The Grafton-Clarkes, aged eight to 13, are all impossibly intelligent children with grand plans. One plans to be an MP, another a professor of oncology, and yet another intends to become a spiritual leader. And Gianluca wants to do maths at Warwick. You laugh at the boy's poverty of ambition until you realise that a) he's eight and b) he means, like, tomorrow. The days they pass their 11-plus exams are marked with flowers, balloons and presents. What a wonderful way to live, you think - if only all children could have their academic achievements rewarded in this way. Then their parents say they feel \"a huge obligation to mankind\" to make sure the children are pushed to exploit their gifts for the good of all. You begin to notice that neither Ma nor Pa Grafton-Clarke blinks quite often enough. They feel that other parents are jealous of their children's achievements, and the family, already geographically isolated (the reason they give for surrounding the house with CCTV cameras), is drawing increasingly in on itself. Whether this is admirable self-sufficiency or evidence of latent Branch Davidian tendencies, only time will tell. \"I try to pay no attention to it,\" says Desiree of the other students' behaviour towards her at school. \"But it does make me a bit upset at times.\" The expression on her wan face makes you suddenly hope that the next G-C to pass exams bursts the balloons, sets fire to the presents and goes on an ice-cream and Laserquest binge with a gang of hoodies. The programme- makers plan to film all the children every two years, so we shall see. But the most intriguing members of this fascinating - and, after the initial recoil, beguiling - bunch are the two 11-year-olds, Dante Minghella and Michael Dowling. Their IQs are off the scale. You can practically hear their brains fizzing. Dante is - well, he's brilliant, he's articulate and, beyond the initial hostility and bravado, one of the most unexpectedly vulnerable and oddly endearing children you're ever likely to meet. He also looks vaguely haunted. He is unlucky in the sense that his talents have a particularly philosophical bent, so he is permanently entangled in questions that cannot be resolved in the way that, say, the equations that preoccupy a maths genius can. His mind is not an easy thing for him or his parents to cope with. In an attempt to release some of his mental energy, he has weekly meetings with an Oxford lecturer, Bob Hargrave, where he can work through some of the thoughts that plague him. \"We're just breeding machines, here to get genes out . . . I could be the only human in a sea of robots for all I know.\" During his IQ test, to his great chagrin, Dante misses a question. He ends up having a conversation with the examiner on the nature of perfection. \"You couldn't design a perfect IQ test,\" he explains. \"But you could get a perfect score on it. So you can only reach perfection within a state of imperfection.\" He pauses and adds wryly, but with relief, to the camera, \"Redeemed myself. Did you get that?\" Michael is astonishing, not just because of his phenomenal and polymath intelligence (he plays the harp, learns Mandarin, Old Norse and five other languages, was a published author at eight, cooks gourmet food, and has read everything from Harry Potter to Dante's - no, not that one, although I suspect it's only a matter of time - Divine Comedy); his emotional maturity also seems to have kept pace with his intellectual development. His mother is an Oxford don who, while clearly delighting in and encouraging his every ability, refuses to let him do his exams early, so that he can remain with his peer group. I hope that, at some point over the next few years, the two of them visit the Grafton-Clarke house. Otherwise, I tell ya, something's gonna burn. Adam Napier-Smith is a freckle-faced, apple-cheeked boy who looks as if he's stepped straight out of a Just William book. Except that, as far as I am aware, none of the Outlaws was au fait with A-level chemistry and engaging in lively debate with his father about Aragandro's number (\"I thought it was Aragandro's theorem?\") by the time he was six. The family moves six times in five years trying to find a suitable school for their son with the IQ of 170. Separated from his friends, Adam's rosiness fades. Eventually they decide to send him to boarding school. He is offered five scholarships and perks up remarkably as they pore over the brochures together."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
