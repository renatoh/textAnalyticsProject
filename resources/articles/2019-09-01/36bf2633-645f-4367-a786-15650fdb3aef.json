So it will be a treat to play on a perfect surface for a change. We deserve it for all the hard yards we put in throughout the season on very poor pitches.\u201d Poor pitches or not, Rochdale have managed to score one of the goals of the season with their patient passing game. Rathbone was on the bench at Southend last month when his teammates delivered a passable imitation of peak-Pep Barcelona, and he claims the standard has been just as high in various other games since the arrival of Brian Barry-Murphy as manager. \u201cThe first game of the season, at Tranmere, we scored two goals after similar passages of play \u2013 it\u2019s not like Roots Hall was a one-off,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve scored a lot of good goals already. Only that one went viral, but that\u2019s the way the manager wants us to play and we won\u2019t shy away from it at Old Trafford.\u201d A technical education with Manchester United sets a young player in good stead for a possession\u2011based game, and though Rathbone has many fond memories of his time at the club where he began as an 11-year-old, he has no regrets about leaving. \u201cI was very lucky to have two great coaches in Warren Joyce and Paul McGuinness, but when the time came to step up from the academy to the reserves I was finding myself on the bench all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cI only stuck it out for a year because basically I wasn\u2019t getting a sniff. When Louis van Gaal was manager he would drop down Adnan Januzaj and Memphis Depay to play in the reserves and I was always the one to get pushed aside. I talked it over with my dad [former Blackburn defender Mick Rathbone], then had a discussion with Warren and Nicky Butt. They said I could stay if I wished, but admitted they could not see a pathway for me to progress. \u201cIt is hard to motivate yourself to train hard every day when there isn\u2019t any sugar at the end, so I realised I had to make a decision. I thought I would do all right in league football. I can say now it\u2019s been the best thing I have ever done in my life, in my entire career. I\u2019ve made almost 120 appearances since coming to Rochdale and it has developed me as a player and a person.\u201d The cheerfulness with which Rathbone says this, sitting behind a folding table in an upstairs room at the homely but unprepossessing Rochdale sports and cricket club, suggests he has adjusted well since being slightly overawed by the ethos he was trying to fit into at United. \u201cWhen you go into the United reserves you enter the first-team environment,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go in the gym and there are pictures of all the legends on the wall, so you are captured in that culture. You realise how many wonderful players were developed at the club, but you also realise very quickly how difficult it is to become a professional footballer, how hard you have to work every single day. \u201cThe sessions were relentless, and when I look at Scott McTominay now, still a friend and someone who has had loads of difficulties with injuries but kept coming back for more, I can only admire him for dealing with a massive amount of pressure. Maybe Scotty was surprised when he was given the chance, but I was not surprised he took it so well.\u201d One United player who did surprise Rathbone was Marcus Rashford, not because he lacked ability but because he was earmarked for great things from an early age and initially it was difficult to work out what all the fuss was about. \u201cEveryone seemed to know Marcus was going to make it, but he was like a baby until he was 15 or 16 and I couldn\u2019t really see it,\u201d Rathbone says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe such a little lad could possibly go up to first-team training and compete with the likes of Rio Ferdinand, but Marcus is tough and determined and in a short space of time he has grown into an incredible footballer and athlete. I know how hard he has worked and the pressure he works under, but I must admit he has handled it all brilliantly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
