Other youngsters arrived with their parents and, as Hoy left the track and found what he hoped would be a quiet corner in which to change, they shuffled closer and then just stood and stared, whispering to each other. \"It is Chris Hoy,\" said one parent. \"Nah, it's not,\" said Sutton. \"It's Sir Chris Hoy.\" Sutton is adamant. \"He thinks I'm taking the piss but I'm not. It's out of respect \u2013 and I've told everyone else to call him 'Sir Chris' as well. I'm bloody serious.\" If it is impossible to tell whether Sutton \u2013 who is as ebullient as he is incorrigible \u2013 is being serious, the same cannot be said of Hoy. His phone is off, his diary is clear and he is here to train for the world championships which begin in Poland in 10 weeks. It comes as a relief to return to full-time training, he says. \"In the 84 days after Beijing I had, on average, three things a day and one day off. I didn't sleep in the same bed for more than two nights in a row. It sounds a bit pathetic but it was exhausting \u2013 it was like really intensive training with no rest days.\" On holiday in late November he discovered that his fame had spread to Thailand. \"It didn't help that I took my bike and went out training every day,\" he admits, \"but I was surprised at how many people seemed to know who I was.\" He returned to be crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year, which served to fuel more demands on his time. And then came the knighthood, announced in the New Year's Honours list. He had known about it since 2 December when his phone rang as he was driving back from an engagement at Gleneagles. \"It was some government department,\" he says vaguely. \"They hadn't heard back from me so they were checking I'd got the letter, which I hadn't, because I'd moved to a new flat. I knew my mum was getting an MBE [for services to nursing] but it wasn't until a couple of weeks later that I found out about the knighthood. \"Obviously it's a huge honour but I think it'll mean more to me when I'm older, when I've retired,\" Hoy continues. \"It'll be a permanent reminder of what I've achieved, though it's not really for achievement, it's for services to sport.\" He believes this means that it comes with additional responsibilities. \"Yeah, I really think it does. It's not that I would behave differently without it \u2013 I wouldn't be going out causing mayhem or shooting my mouth off in the press \u2013 but it makes me aware of the responsibility I have not only to myself but to my sport, which will continue after I retire. I do see it as an opportunity to raise the profile of the sport and to give something back and I do take that responsibility seriously. \"If you look at the honours list and see the cyclists on it, it's incredible. Who would have been able to talk about track cycling four years ago? Who'd have been able to name events or athletes? It's a bit like Sports Personality of the Year: I look on it as a big honour for me personally but also for my sport.\" He is aware of some criticism, the main one \u2013 apart from those who are unilaterally opposed to the Honours system \u2013 being that, at 32, he is too young. \"I made a comment saying that it was 'mad' that I'm getting a knighthood for riding a bike but I meant mad as in unbelievable,\" he says. \"And then you hear people saying I should turn it down. Why would I turn it down?\" Clearly others within the British cycling team are following Sutton's lead \u2013 a tiny sticker on the top tube of his new road bike identifies its owner as Sir Chris Hoy. \"Jason Queally's has 'Lord Queally,'\" says Hoy, \"so I think that's the mechanics having a wee laugh \u2013 it's tongue-in-cheek. \"Of course I don't expect people to call me Sir Chris,\" he continues. \"That'd be embarrassing. People here [in Perth] have been calling me that, mainly down to Shane telling them to, and it is a bit cringeworthy. When I see Matt Pinsent I call him Matt. I suppose there will be formal occasions when you're called Sir. But, you know, it means a lot to people \u2013 it means a lot to me.\" Sutton chips in by pointing out that \"success changes some people but not Chris \u2013 same with this. He might be Sir Chris, quadruple Olympic champion, but he's the same fella.\" To illustrate the point, two days after his knighthood was announced, Hoy and Jason Kenny, the Olympic gold and silver medallist, travelled to Holland for the Six Days of Rotterdam, alone and unsupported \u2013 with no coach or mechanic. Thus could Hoy be seen in track centre, spanner in hand, making adjustments to his bike \u2013 the equivalent would be to see Lewis Hamilton lying under his F1 car. But Hoy belongs to a British cycling team that is renowned for keeping egos in check and athletes \u2013 no matter how decorated \u2013 on their toes. It was Sutton who said after Beijing that, if the 36-year-old Hoy makes it to London in 2012, \"we [coaches] won't have done our jobs properly\". Yet at the end of what Sutton described as a \"real quality\" training session in Perth yesterday, Hoy recalled those words with something approaching relish. He has every intention of proving him wrong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
