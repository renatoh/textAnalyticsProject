Tea-breaks. Proper, everything stops for tea, tools-down-at-four tea breaks. Preferably with a tea lady or tea, er, gentleman to guide me through the delights of the treats selection box. That's not the half of it. I also regret the passing of the full-hour lunch break. I'm feeling bereft at the loss of the annual works outing. But the final straw in the coffin for a more genteel, relaxed and altogether more civilised way of doing things is the demise of the sandwich man. \u00b7 A survey from Office Angels has found that 59% of us say these charming traditions make work more sociable and 28% say they help motivation. But it gets worse: our new traditions are appalling. Long working hours, eating at our desks, team-bonding days (who, hand on heart, enjoys team bonding? Sadists?), open-plan offices. No wonder 23% of workers just crave a bit of personal attention as conference calls and email take over. We're not often given to nostalgia at OH Towers, but given the choice between a BlackBerry and blackberry jam on toast (and maybe a new tea cosy), there's simply no competition. \u00b7 And if a nice cup of tea at 4pm has the potential to transform productivity, just think what a proper cup of coffee (in a proper pot, obviously) administered at 9am could do! Though not too much coffee: you don't want to become hysterical and discover that instead of methodically filing the 700 emails you received while you were on holiday, you've deleted the whole lot. Research carried out at Glasgow and Paisley universities released this week suggests that more than a third of us are stressed by email, especially when we come back from holiday. Although, as a time-management technique, deleting everything has a lot going for it: it's quick, you get that lovely empty-inbox feeling, and if it's really important, people are bound to resend. Eventually. \u00b7 In the meantime, however, without email, you're going to have to find something to fill your time. Ever fancied a bit of online trading, stocks and shares, that sort of thing? No? Well, given the, ahem, \"exciting\" times people in the City were having last week, keeping well out of it is probably for the best - but did you know that 48% of investors say they clip their hedge funds and polish their gilts in the office? And that 14% pretend to be working while they trade? And to think I spend that time shopping. Anyway, intriguingly, 13% of online traders say that when they win big they don't tell anyone. Depressingly, this can only mean that while I'm wasting my time fantasising about what kind of cake I'm going to have at teatime, someone, somewhere in the office, is fantasising about the kind of silver platter they'd like the butler to use to deliver it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
