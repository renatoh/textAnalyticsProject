Unfortunately for Trump, things got off to a rocky start \u2013 there was a \u201ctesty exchange\u201d with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for one, and Trump had harsh words for Canada. But the worst for Trump was a video which captured Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, and Macron laughing at Trump during a reception. Noah called the video \u201camazing\u201d for two reasons: one, \u201cit\u2019s crazy that we were able to hear a private conversation between major world leaders. Like, did they not know this was happening? \u201cAnd two, that when world leaders get together, they\u2019re gossipy bitches just like the rest of us.\u201d In response, Trump called Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d and announced that he would leave the summit early. The premature departure suggested to Noah that the video \u201churt his feelings. It was like Trump was at a sleepover, and all the other kids turned on him. And now he\u2019s there like, \u2018Mom, I know it\u2019s a day early, but could you come pick me up from Nato?\u2019 \u201cI know a lot of people don\u2019t like Trump, but I don\u2019t care who you are, man: every single one of us knows this feeling,\u201d said Noah of \u201cfinding out all the cool kids at school are laughing at you\u201d. It\u2019s good for Trump to come home early, Noah concluded, back to a place \u201cwhere we promise that we will laugh at you to your face\u201d. Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert returned from Thanksgiving break to cover the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s 300-plus page impeachment inquiry report, which said that by pressuring Ukraine, Trump \u201cplaced his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States\u201d. Before the House intelligence committee\u2019s report, the GOP released their own \u201cpre-buttal\u201d in which they concluded that Trump \u201cwas acting on genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine\u201d. \u201cYes, because the two words everyone uses to describe Donald Trump are genuine and reasonable,\u201d Colbert deadpanned, \u201cright after athletic and monogamous\u201d. The Republican claims were bogus, Colbert continued, because \u201ctheir argument is based on the claim that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC server \u2013 an idea that\u2019s been completely debunked as a Russian-fueled conspiracy theory. \u201cPlus, even if Ukraine had meddled in the 2016 election, the proper organization to investigate that is not Rudy Giuliani,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the CBS show FBI is not called My Drunken Personal Attorney.\u201d Colbert also touched on the president\u2019s trip to London to celebrate Nato\u2019s 70th anniversary. \u201cLike most anniversaries, Trump was in a bad mood, wishing he was with a younger eastern European ally,\u201d Colbert explained. And of course, there\u2019s the video of world leaders laughing at Trump, in which Trudeau described Trump\u2019s impromptu press conference as \u201cyou just watched his team\u2019s jaws drop to the floor\u201d. \u201cHey Justin, be nice!\u201d Colbert jokingly rebutted. \u201cStephen Miller\u2019s jaw only does that when it\u2019s feeding time and they bring him the baby deer.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also reacted to the video of world leaders trashing Trump. \u201cTrudeau is one thing, but Boris Johnson \u2013 that\u2019s the one that\u2019s gotta hurt most,\u201d Kimmel surmised. \u201cBoris? Sweet, disheveled, crazy hair Boris? He\u2019s supposed to be the Donald Trump of England and he\u2019s laughing.\u201d Meanwhile, back home, the House judiciary committee held meetings on Wednesday in which constitutional law scholars testified on whether or not Trump\u2019s conduct, as laid out in the impeachment inquiry, constituted high crimes and misdemeanors. Three of the four professors thought it absolutely did. \u201cThey said what [Trump] did was exactly what the founders had in mind when they outlined impeachment in the constitution,\u201d Kimmel explained. \u201cBasically, they rolled up the constitution and spanked him with it. \u201cIt all boils down to this: Donald Trump used the office of president for his own personal gain, which must confuse him because he\u2019s like yeah, of course I did \u2014 that\u2019s why I ran for president,\u201d Kimmel continued. Which led Kimmel to his dream Christmas gift for the year 2019: \u201cI\u2019d love to see what these Republicans would say if President Obama had done this,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if Obama had frozen millions of dollars of military aid to one of our allies who was at war in exchange for dirt on Mitt Romney. They\u2019d be losing their minds.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
