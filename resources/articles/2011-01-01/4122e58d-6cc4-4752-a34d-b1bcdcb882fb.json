His fourth album as Iron and Wine is accordingly packed with sounds that a more self-conscious indie-folk musician wouldn't contemplate. The bass on Me and Lazarus struts its funky stuff like a vicar frugging at a wedding; Rabbit Will Run is beset by maniacally tweeting panpipes; the saxophone on Big Burned Hand sounds half-strangled. Stop wincing at these foibles and focus on the lyrics, however, and you'll soon feel chastised for your shallowness. Beam comes across as a latterday prophet, casting his gentle eye over capitalist, warmongering western society with sorrow and kindness. His eccentric experimentation does much to temper the earnestness of his endeavour \u2013 and makes you appreciate all the more the direct loveliness of piano ballad Godless Brother in Love and the honeyed nostalgia of Tree By the River."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
