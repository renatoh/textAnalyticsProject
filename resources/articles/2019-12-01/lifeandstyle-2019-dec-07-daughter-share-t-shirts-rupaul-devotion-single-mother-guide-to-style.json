She put me in a fit and flare polka-dot dress and black Dolce heels studded with lipsticks. I couldn\u2019t explain that I didn\u2019t want to wear their clothes any more because they dress the Trump women and so she was dismayed when I wore brown wedges, both PC and wrong with the outfit. Walking up the cobbled streets to the castle, she kept urging me to go back to the room and change so Kylie wouldn\u2019t see and have to stop the show. I tried to deflect: \u201cThe other heels would be too difficult to walk in on cobblestones.\u201d \u201cYou could try! RuPaul could do it.\u201d Both very tired and aware I was wearing ugly shoes, I snapped: \u201cI\u2019m not RuPaul! I\u2019m never going to be RuPaul!\u201d My daughter is only six. After her father and I divorced, she decided to start honing my style for me and, with the concentration of a small child newly entranced by Lego, became determined to build me into a brighter, tighter shape, as if that might somehow draw her dad back. She hid my trousers and nixed sensible shoes by saying, \u201cOh sorry, too small\u201d, operatically miming a failure to fit them to my foot, like OJ trying on the glove in the witness stand. RuPaul had emerged as her inspiration one day at the bus stop, when we couldn\u2019t get her dad on FaceTime. She tried to channel her disappointment with the phone by asking that we use it to find \u201cpictures of the beautiful black woman\u201d. Which one, I asked. \u201cThe most beautiful one.\u201d I pulled up Beyonc\u00e9, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Eartha Kitt. Logically, I knew my daughter was not asking to look at photographs of Eartha Kitt, but her unhappiness was about to spill over into rage and I was rifling through the internet as if digging in a cluttered purse for my asthma inhaler. \u201cThe black lady with a boy living inside her!\u201d \u201cOh. RuPaul.\u201d Of course. I suspected she loved Ru so much because he is, like her father, a gigantic personality, who also takes up physical space with his height. Struggling with how to enforce rules as we set up a new home in a new country, I also wondered if she was drawn to the boundaries he sets each week, the calm, confident reprimand he issues his \u201cchildren\u201d when they are crossed. Half our clothing was still in boxes, but with what we could access, my daughter guided me towards emulating RuPaul: high heels, hyper-feminine dresses with defined waists. It didn\u2019t matter that her dad couldn\u2019t see us because he was still in Los Angeles, nor that when we were in the same place he could barely \u2013 for nearly a year \u2013 look at me. This was the style she needed me to project in order for the family to reconfigure. In the end, she surrendered the fantasy of her parents reuniting once she understood RuPaul was a man. Now she hastens me towards high heels and long lashes so RuPaul will want to marry me, in the manner, I suppose, of two teens in Clash T-shirts, drawn to each other as they pass on the street. As she was honing her sense of what my style should be post-divorce, I was letting her down by pulling in the opposite direction and wearing a parade of vintage kids\u2019 shirts from her closet. I\u2019ve sourced them at thrift stores worldwide for her but ended up wearing them myself, for the playground and school drop-off, warping the line of Rugrats, Fraggle Rock, The Simpsons with my breasts. I wore a Ralph Wiggum T-shirt to drop her at her first day of year 1, knowing the children would find Ralph irresistible. They resisted, and I went home realising how unflatteringly the design fell across my bust, for him and for me. Seeing my reflection in a bus window, I saw an Amy Poehler single-mum character who uses a warm childhood memory as cover for flaunting her hot body, and felt the shudder of revulsion I used to feel for adults I\u2019d notice reading Harry Potter: this was not meant for you. Adulthood changes the shape of things. Mork &amp; Mindy was the first of her T-shirts I co-opted. She came back from class, pulled it off and, picking up after her, I instinctively put it on my own body, the same way I eat the food she leaves on her plate, the same way I transfer the baby moisturiser from her skin to mine when there\u2019s a surplus. She is young enough to still be in the honeymoon period of her love for me, even more so now it\u2019s just us. If I carry her sleeping from a car, she kisses me gently on the lips and breathes, \u201cI love you\u201d without waking. I\u2019m deep in her subconscious, which makes me feel guilty that I am also in her wardrobe. Beyond the shared T-shirts and the RuPaul devotion, we also have clothes we match in. This concept of \u201ctwinning\u201d constitutes a whole other psychiatric constellation. Everyone from capitalist behemoths Dolce &amp; Gabbana to fashion-forward brands such as Batsheva makes mother/daughter clothes. In my more cynical moments, I think mini-me dressing is for women who don\u2019t have their own style, but that is disproven by my favourite Instagram star, Brooklyn\u2019s Maayan Zilberman, the artisan candy maker who sews her and baby Freddie matching styles. Her own pink ruffled lace blouse was part sacrificed to make a romper, the sleeves now legs, and a banana-print dress gave enough to birth a leotard. I love Zilberman\u2019s interpretation of sharing clothes with her daughter, because it\u2019s a metaphor that says: I would literally give my right arm for you, but I am still me. In my own case, I feel that twinning gives off the whiff of parental narcissism, and the possibility that matching outfits both infantilise the mother and pre-sexualise the child. I\u2019ve leaned into it when I\u2019ve felt depleted or unattractive, a visual trick \u2013 for others, for myself \u2013 to convince them, \u201cShe\u2019s adorable, I must be, too.\u201d Twinning flirts with two worst-case parenting scenarios: that our children should not feel we own them, and that our children should never feel confusion about who in the relationship is the grownup. The boom also returns us to the middle ages, when there was no such thing as children\u2019s clothing, and kids were simply dressed as miniature adults. Being a parent and now a single parent, I\u2019m examining my boundary issues under a microscope I took from someone else without asking. I didn\u2019t gravitate towards wearing my daughter\u2019s T-shirts because I think childhood is better or easier than adulthood. My adult life has been less confusing and more rewarding to navigate. One day, my daughter will understand, as I now do, that life can be beautiful and it can also just go wrong. She doesn\u2019t need to know any of that, not yet. For now, I hug her tight, and \u2013 as if I am my own RuPaul, gently reprimanding myself for transgressing \u2013 give her back her T-shirts. \u2022 Emma Forrest\u2019s novel Royals (Bloomsbury) is out now.
