But they are everyday stuff in the Netherlands, where no party has won an overall majority since the first world war and none has polled more than 30% of the vote in more than 20 years. Even so, this week's general election has produced an exceptionally fragmented result, with the Liberals leapfrogging from fourth to first in the vote, though still with only 20% support and a mere 31 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament, while the previously governing centre-right Christian Democrats plunged in the opposite direction to 14% (21 seats), the worst result in the party's history. Whenever a party of the extremes polls dramatically well in Europe, many here are tempted to see this as the most important feature of the result. This week the Freedom party of the anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim Geert Wilders more than doubled its vote, finishing third on 15%, and is demanding a place in whatever coalition emerges from the Netherlands' long process of government formation. Yet this success must be seen in perspective. In an election where many conditions \u2013 the recession and the eurozone crisis among them \u2013 favoured a protectionist and xenophobic party, Mr Wilders actually polled less well that his predecessor party, the Pim Fortuyn List, did in 2002. The Freedom party's 15% is certainly disturbing, but it is very much on a par with similar movements in Belgium, France and Denmark which have rarely been able to push beyond the mid-teens of public support. And outsider parties have often done well in recent Dutch elections before falling back \u2013 exactly what happened to the leftwing Socialists in 2006 and 2010. A less exciting but more accurate reading of Wednesday's result would be that the votes of the centre-left parties held up, while those of the right splintered both to the Liberals and the Freedom party. Indisputably the Christian Democrats were the big losers. In an election dominated not by immigration but by the economy and the deficit, Dutch voters could therefore be said to have opted for fiscal austerity with a social conscience, much as British voters did a month ago. This leaves the Liberals well placed to govern with the centre-left in what would here be called a progressive coalition. Without any clearly dominant party in the new parliament, it will not be easy to form a new government. Yet there is every reason to think and hope that the Liberal leader Mark Rutte will ultimately be able to form such a coalition. If so, that would be the best outcome for the Netherlands and Europe, and for the wider standing of both. Dutch voters have not given Mr Wilders a mandate to govern, and he should certainly not now be rewarded with one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
