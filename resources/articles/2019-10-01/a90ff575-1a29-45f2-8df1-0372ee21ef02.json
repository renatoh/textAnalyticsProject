Hairdresser Polly (Sarah Lancashire) doesn\u2019t even shout when she finds her 15-year-old daughter Leona\u2019s latest one-night stand still in her bedroom. She just flings his clothes at him, notes that Leona (Jade Croot) is underage and that he looks 28, and makes him jump out of the window. Then she takes herself off to the local charity run with her friends. They are walking, Polly\u2019s best friend, Angela (Joanna Scanlan), says firmly. So begins the new four-part drama by Jack Thorne, the unassailable powerhouse behind the likes of This is England, Skins, Kiri (in which Lancashire also starred) and the forthcoming adaptation of Philip Pullman\u2019s fantasy trilogy, His Dark Materials. The people of the small \u201cleft behind\u201d fictional Welsh town of Glyngolau are celebrating a new construction project \u2013 championed by Polly\u2019s husband Iwan, the local councillor \u2013 that is due to bring 1,000 new jobs to the area. As they start their \u201crun\u201d they hear a terrible noise. On the building site, a factory block has blown up. What follows is the story of the shockwaves that ripple out from that event, finding the fissures in the community and causing relationships to crumble as people assign blame, cope with bereavement and survive the fallout. Youngsters were trespassing inside the building when the explosion happened. Ash floats down silently as Polly and her friends realise their sons and daughters are trapped beneath the rubble. The husband of another friend, Debbie (Genevieve Barr), was in charge of security on the site and is also missing. They wait quietly at the hospital until doctors pad down corridors to deliver the news. Polly and Iwan\u2019s daughter has life-changing injuries. Angela\u2019s daughter, Mia, is dead, along with several other people, including Debbie\u2019s husband. Instantly, the air is thick with grief, injustice and resentment. The luck of the draw is rarely more unbearable. Inside Polly\u2019s home after the initial shock has worn off, a harrowing scene shows how some people channel their anger, guilt or impotence \u2013 or perhaps simply use events to justify behaviour that is always searching for an excuse to come out. It is a scene that reminds us not to forget the question of personal responsibility, even as larger ones threaten to dwarf it. As grief gives way to anger (\u201cNo singing!\u201d screams a furious Angela as the townspeople return to the site to keep vigil the night after the explosion), the question of who is to blame comes to the fore. The shifting pressures are minutely recorded in Thorne\u2019s dense but delicate script and Sandra Goldbacher\u2019s searching direction. Thorne\u2019s inspiration is the Grenfell tower fire, and the issues of corporate responsibility, greed and inhumanity raised by it. But the Welsh setting inevitably calls to mind perhaps the most potent example of negligence and inhumanity there has ever been, the Aberfan disaster, which cost a village its children 53 years ago \u2013 almost to the day The Accident was broadcast. The face of the construction company is Harriet (Sidse Babbett Knudsen), on whom Polly turns at the site as the first bodies are brought out, accusing her of doing things on the cheap, all of which is captured by the television cameras. Harriet is already struggling with the conflict between her natural instinct to help and her professional need to keep a distance. What the latter masks and how much truth there is to Polly\u2019s claim will surely only become more complicated over the coming weeks. The Accident is another magnificent example of Thorne\u2019s talent for taking a huge story containing multitudinous contemporary concerns and distilling them into emotive stories on a scale we can cope with, be compelled by, learn from. The Accident forms, Thorne has said, the third part of a loose trilogy that began with 2016\u2019s National Treasure (about the trial of a TV personality accused of Operation Yewtree-like offences) and continued in Kiri (about the death of a child in care), which looks at who and what we are as a nation, the lies we tell ourselves, the money and the politics that corrupt us and the lines along which we crack when under pressure. It promises to be a fittingly thoughtful and wholly absorbing last instalment. Though not, of course, the last drama from Thorne, who looks set fair to become the Alan Bleasdale of our tattered age. Never have we had more need of one. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 October 2019 because an earlier version misnamed the character played by Joanna Scanlan, Angela, as Anna.
