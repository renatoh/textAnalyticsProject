The eldest daughter of parents from Mirpur, Pakistan, she grew up in Birmingham with four brothers and three sisters, and took huge comfort from looking after her nani amma \u2013 an experience that propelled her to keep on helping people. Last January, Nasreen fulfilled a lifelong ambition of graduating from university to become a fully qualified nurse at Walsall Manor Hospital. Last Friday, it was announced that Nasreen and fellow nurse Aimee O\u2019Rourke, both mothers of three children, had died, along with two healthcare assistants. The 36-year-old became the youngest NHS worker to die from Covid-19, leaving her family raw with grief. Speaking to the Observer, Kazeema, 33, paid tribute to her sister\u2019s sacrifice. \u201cShe was a legend,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cEveryone remembers her with so much love and heartbreak because she had so much love to give. She was like a mum to us. She looked after us all.\u201d The three sisters had spent five hours chatting at home before Nasreen went into intensive care two weeks ago. \u201cMe and her were like twins,\u201d said Kazeema. \u201cWe got married on the same day, into the same family. We even had the same due date.\u201d Kazeema and younger sister Ash, 32, had sat by her bedside at home. \u201cReema just wanted to sit and talk that day. She called mum in Pakistan and told her not to worry. She had to hold her breath really hard because the coughing was so bad. She just said to her: \u2018I\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t be upset otherwise I\u2019ll get upset\u2019. And then we took her to hospital.\u201d Nasreen began her career at Walsall Manor Hospital in 2003 as a housekeeper, the year after she got married. She began nursing soon after and was a popular presence on the ward. One colleague, who didn\u2019t want to give her name, told the Observer: \u201cWe love her and miss her. She was an amazing nurse and so grateful for the privilege to do what we do. She always put her patients first and herself last.\u201d Speaking to the Observer, relative Dr Samara Afzal said the family\u2019s heartbreaking loss was \u201cdeeply compounded\u201d by the severe, isolated restrictions of lockdown. \u201cNormally, hundreds of people would come to the house and be there to support family members,\u201d she said. \u201cBut with a pandemic, it\u2019s impossible and it\u2019s hard to know how someone is coping without being face to face.\u201d Nasreen\u2019s elderly parents had initially been stranded in Pakistan by flight cancellations, unable to get home to Birmingham as their daughter was being put on a ventilator in intensive care. Nasreen\u2019s three children, aged from seven to 16 years, were not permitted to visit their mother in hospital. Her funeral was held last Friday, and attended only by immediate family members. \u201cThe [funeral procession] drove along our road and that was enough for us,\u201d said Kazeema. \u201cEveryone respected the distancing rule \u2013 Reema would have been really upset if we hadn\u2019t.\u201d The younger sisters were taking care to comfort their niece and nephews. \u201cI was putting my nephew to bed and he asked if I was going to be his mum now and I just said, \u2018Of course, we\u2019ve always been your mums\u2019.\u201d Kazeema began to cry. She had followed in her sister\u2019s footsteps to work in Walsall Manor Hospital a few years ago. \u201cMe and my younger sister always supported Reema: we always looked after the kids and cooked for her and her husband when she was following her dream of going to uni. I don\u2019t know if I could live up to what she did. She was an angel.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s tragic,\u201d said Afzal. \u201cShe was so full of life and such a positive person to be around, always the life and soul at family gatherings and weddings. She was so dedicated to her job and her family, too. She was a fantastic role model and influence for Asian women.\u201d Former patients of Nasreen, who was frequently described by colleagues as \u201cconfident and bubbly\u201d, paid tribute on a Facebook post by Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, remembering her as \u201cprofessional and kind\u201d, \u201ca fabulous nurse,\u201d \u201ca smiling hero\u201d. \u201cShe loved her work, her patients and her colleagues and she always had a smile,\u201d said nurse Fatima Parkar at Walsall Manor Hospital. \u201cI was very proud of her because, like me, she was a mature student. She worked, she studied and still looked after her family. It\u2019s not easy but she followed her passion.\u201d A fundraiser set up in Nasreen\u2019s memory last Friday raised over \u00a33,000 in less than 24 hours. \u201cAreema went out of her way with charity \u2013 she had a really big heart,\u201d said Afzal. \u201cThe money will be donated to causes she was close to, particularly helping poorer families.\u201d Richard Beeken, chief executive of Walsall Healthcare, told the Observer that staff had been hit especially hard by Nasreen\u2019s death. \u201cShe was an inspiration by virtue of what she achieved. To qualify as a clinical professional and be exemplary as she was\u2026 There is a local, community connection that will be felt far and wide.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
