Top stories The 11 people killed in a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue have been named. Among the victims, the youngest of whom was 54, the oldest 97, are two brothers and a husband and wife, who died on what the city\u2019s mayor, Bill Peduto, called the \u201cdarkest day of Pittsburgh\u2019s history\u201d. Peduto rejected calls from Donald Trump to use armed guards in houses of worship, to combat mass shooters. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with irrational behaviour,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way you can rationalise a person walking into a synagogue during services and taking the lives of 11 people. The approach we need to be looking at is how we take the guns \u2013 which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America \u2013 out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder.\u201d Among the victims were Melvin Wax, Jerry Rabinowitz and Joyce Fienberg. They were remembered by loved ones on Sunday night. \u201cHe was such a kind, kind person,\u201d said Myron Snider, chairman of the New Light congregation\u2019s cemetery committee about Wax. \u201cHe and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other. Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time.\u201d Rabinowitz, a physician, was described as \u201ctruly a trusted confidant and healer.\u201d Joyce Fienberg was an intellectual powerhouse, who, among other things, studied the practices of highly effective teachers. Dr Gaea Leinhardt, Fienberg\u2019s research partner for decades, said she was devastated by the murder of her colleague and friend. The Sri Lankan minister Arjuna Ranatunga\u2019s bodyguards have opened fire on protesters. One person has died and two were injured after the bodyguards of fired on a crowd amid a deepening constitutional crisis in the island nation. Ranatunga, the petroleum minister and a former Sri Lankan cricket captain, was trying to enter a government agency in the capital, Colombo, about 3pm on Sunday when he was confronted by supporters of the president, Maithripala Sirisena. Amid jostling, Ranatunga\u2019s bodyguards began shooting, injuring three people, two of them critically, according to a police spokesman, Ruwan Gunasekera. One of the injured died later in hospital. Jobs are front of mind for voters in the lead-up to the Victorian election. Gay Alcorn checks in on the electorate of Morwell in the Latrobe Valley and finds that while the 2014 closure of the Hazelwood power station wasn\u2019t quite the unemployment disaster that was feared, coal politics are still at the forefront. The interactive is the first in a Guardian Australia series looking at what voters are really saying in key seats that could tip the Andrews government into minority, or put the Coalition in power. Alcorn will return to Morwell as the campaign progresses towards the 24 November vote to take the seat\u2019s pulse again. A third of Australia\u2019s foreign workers are paid half the minimum wage. The most comprehensive study conducted to date on wage theft and working conditions among international students, backpackers and other temporary migrants in Australia has found almost a third earned half the minimum wage or less. The survey also found large-scale wage theft was worst in fruit and vegetable-picking and farm work. The findings show that for every 100 underpaid migrant workers, only three went to the fair work ombudsman. Of those, more than half recovered nothing. \u201cOur study confirms that Australia has a large, silent underclass of underpaid migrant workers,\u201d said one of the researchers, Bassina Farbenblum. \u201cThe scale of unclaimed wages is likely well over a billion dollars.\u201d Leicester City\u2019s owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, is understood to have been on board a helicopter that crashed outside a stadium in Leicester on Saturday night. The helicopter, carrying at least five people, was seen spiralling down to earth shortly after leaving the ground. It is understood that there are no survivors. Hundreds of supporters \u2013 from various teams \u2013 have arrived at the stadium to lay bouquets of flowers, shirts and scarves to pay respect to the Thai billionaire, who has become a hugely popular figure at the club. He will be remembered as the man who brought an improbable and historic Premier League title to Leicester in 2016, defying odds of 5,000-1. Sport Saturday\u2019s A-league football pitted evolution against revolution, writes Jonathan Howcroft. The Sydney derby was a contrast in styles as one club\u2019s commitment to long-term planning triumphed. The Wallabies are stretching their fans\u2019 faith to the limit. Their 37-20 loss to the All Blacks in Yokohama makes any successful World Cup campaign look unlikely. Fans need proof if they\u2019re to heed Michael Cheika\u2019s calls for belief in the team. Thinking time As Brazilians cast their votes, Jair Bolsonaro appears on the brink of victory. Cristina Gozdal headed to the polls on Sunday morning wearing the yellow and green colours of Brazil\u2019s national flag and hoping her country was about to elect its very own Donald Trump. \u201cHe thinks like the people think,\u201d she said of the far-right candidate. Around her, other voters chimed in with their support of the man who stands on the verge of leading the world\u2019s fourth-largest democracy despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 his venom-filled tongue and oft-voiced nostalgia for dictatorship. On the eve of the election, polls gave Bolsonaro an 8% to 10% advantage over his leftist rival, Fernando Haddad. When Linda Jackson was young, she wanted to be \u201ceverything\u201d. The artist and designer who helped establish a distinctly Australian fashion aesthetic speaks to Alexandra Spring about her \u201cgreatest achievement\u201d: Rainbow Menagerie, her picture book filled with her trademark designs inspired by native Australian animals, published this month. Jackson is known for her colourful prints created with Jenny Kee in the 70s and her Bush Couture label in the 80s. Farewell, false love, the oracle of lies. What became of Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s severed head? On the eve of the 400th anniversary of his execution for treason, a discovery at a medieval manor in Surrey may help solve the mystery. A red silk velvet bag found in the attic of West Horsley Place, the former home of Raleigh\u2019s son, could have been used by Raleigh\u2019s widow to carry around his embalmed head. Media roundup Scott Morrison\u2019s approval rating has slipped into the negative, according to a Newspoll conducted for the Australian, with 44% of voters dissatisfied with the prime minister\u2019s performance. Meanwhile, trust in banks has fallen to a new low, too, the Australian Financial Review writes, with just one in five Australians believing banks act ethically. A landmark $1.1m settlement between a student who was sexually assaulted and one of the country\u2019s most elite private schools could unleash a wave of court action against institutions that have made modest payments to victims of abuse, including the Catholic church, the Age reports. Coming up Cricket Australia is due to release the results of its independent cultural review, which was called after the South Africa tour ball-tampering scandal. Bill Shorten will address the Lowy Institute in Sydney this afternoon, delivering a speech on Australia\u2019s foreign policy.
