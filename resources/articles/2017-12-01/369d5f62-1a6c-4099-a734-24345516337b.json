There was Grace\u2019s showdown with Major Campbell in series one, and last year saw the mass arrests. The climax to series four, however, arguably came two-thirds of the way through the episode, when Tommy Shelby kept his promised meeting in Margate with Alfie Solomons, a meeting from which only one of them could emerge. It was inevitable that the cancer-stricken Alfie (\u201criddled with it, Tommy\u201d), who ended up bleeding his life out with only his dog Cyril for comfort, would make way \u2013 and the show will be considerably the poorer for the absence of Tom Hardy. Inevitable, but not without consequence. One of the most interesting things about Peaky Blinders has always been the suggestion that Tommy is not actually impervious to the damage he wreaks. And so it proved as the end of Changretta\u2019s vendetta, Alfie\u2019s death and some ill-advised time off playing golf triggered a gin-driven existential crisis in the Shelby leader. He pulled his way out of it, thanks largely to Polly, but the question remains: what kind of a man is Tommy Shelby? The ending saw Tommy, now the newly elected Labour MP for Birmingham South, celebrate with friends and family. Certainly, this Thomas Shelby had no qualms about betraying Jessie or using her to get what he desired. It was a smart, bittersweet ending and one I enjoyed, although it felt more like the end of the entire show, and I do wonder where the show and Steven Knight intend to go now. Our heroes If the ending was downbeat, the opening certainly wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know about the rest of you, but I was completely fooled by Arthur\u2019s apparent death (not least because the entire episode seemed to have a certain amount of clearing the decks going on). I\u2019m not generally a fan of sudden resurrections, but in this case, I think it worked. I was sad that there no longer appears any chance of Arthur building a peaceful life in the country, particularly now Linda appears to have chosen cocaine over the saving of souls. Arthur wasn\u2019t the only Shelby facing a reckoning, as Michael found himself exiled to New York (I knew Tommy wouldn\u2019t forgive him for not mentioning the plot with Luca) and poor, gentle Finn was forced to fully embrace his Peaky heritage. Meanwhile, Lizzie gave birth to a daughter, Ruby, and appeared to have strengthened her position in Tommy\u2019s life, if not her claim on his heart. Polly appeased her demons and saved her son, while Ada continued to watch from the sidelines \u2013 no doubt silently noting that Tommy\u2019s cock can indeed stop a revolution. Talking of the infamous Shelby appendage: the only part of the episode I wasn\u2019t sure about was the use of Jessie Eden. While it\u2019s certainly arguable that both Jessie and Tommy are both trying to convert the other and arguable, too, that Tommy is simply playing all sides \u2013 king, communists, the Labour party \u2013 for the greater glory of the Shelby company, I remain a little uneasy with the ending\u2019s suggestion that Jessie was now on the Shelby team and helping Tommy\u2019s campaign. It felt rather as though it was doing a disservice to the real-life Jessie Eden, a committed Communist party member. The bad guys The big question about this series of Peaky Blinders was: who was the real villain? Luca Changretta, who brought vendetta to Small Heath? The mysterious Aberama Gold, with his western-style notions of vengeance? Solomons, who manipulated his own death by betraying Tommy? Or, as the crisis towards the end suggested, Tommy\u2019s own nature? As the episode progressed it became clear that it certainly wasn\u2019t Changretta. Luca turned out to be little more than a spoilt mamma\u2019s boy with grand ideas who was rather too easily outsmarted thanks to a few well-placed phone calls (never let it be said that Tommy doesn\u2019t have the contact book to end them all). I wasn\u2019t particularly a fan of Al Capone as deus ex machina, although it was clearly signposted by Alfie\u2019s initial conversation about big beating small, and it certainly made sense that Luca had been so obsessed by his vendetta he\u2019d failed to pay attention to events back home. Plus, there was some justice in the fact that the old ways triumphed and Arthur pulled the trigger in the end. As for the show\u2019s other possible villain, Aberama Gold, he never really came into focus. Was he a good man or a bad one? Someone worth having on side or just an opportunist? Perhaps we will have a clearer idea in the new series, if as expected, he steps into the sadly vacated Alfie Solomons\u2019 role of sometime ally/sometime enemy. Personally, I found the blank-eyed Bonnie Gold to be an altogether more terrifying prospect: his bloodlust is of the kind that might even make Arthur pause for thought. Additional notes Of all the many things I love about Tom Hardy\u2019s performance as Alfie Solomons, I think my favourite was that he ensured there was a dog present to lick his blood at the end. I was actually screaming at the screen: \u201cJust listen to Arthur, Tommy\u201d during the boxing match. Hurrah for the sudden appearance of Karl as Arthur\u2019s fake funeral cortege drove through Small Heath. Not abandoned in Boston after all. The best news of the night was that Mr Devlin was allowed to go to Glasgow and his family. Safe journey, Mr Devlin, and whatever you do \u2026 don\u2019t look back. Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week While it was fitting that Tommy had his existential crisis to the sombre strains of Radiohead, in a Laura Marling-heavy week (she also did the version of Red Right Hand at the beginning), I\u2019m giving this to her beautiful cover of A Hard Rains A-Gonna Fall, one of my favourite Dylan songs. Quote of the week Tempting as it is to give this to walking quote machine Alfie Solomons, the most important moment of the night was Polly\u2019s advice to Tommy about how to deal with his demons: \u201cWe live somewhere between life and death, waiting to move on, and in the end we accept it. We shake hands with the devils and we walk past them.\u201d Finally, a big thank you to everyone who has posted below the line each week. It\u2019s been a pleasure. Happy Christmas, now help yourself to a glass of Mr Shelby\u2019s special gin and drink any end-of-season sadness away.
