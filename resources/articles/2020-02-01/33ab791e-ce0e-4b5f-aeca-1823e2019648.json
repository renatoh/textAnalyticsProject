Graham, a top ally of Donald Trump who was part of the successful vote to acquit him in his impeachment trial last week, cautioned that this information from the president\u2019s personal lawyer \u201ccould be Russian propaganda\u201d. \u201cThe Department of Justice is receiving information coming out of the Ukraine from Rudy,\u201d Graham said, explaining that the US attorney general, William Barr, \u201ctold me that they\u2019ve created a process that Rudy could give information and they would see if it\u2019s verified\u201d. Giuliani was deeply implicated in Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukrainian officials to help his 2020 re-election bid \u2013 the matter at the heart of the impeachment trial. Trump was impeached in the Democratic-led House after withholding military assistance, as well as a White House meeting, while calling for Ukraine announcing investigations into potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump also wanted Ukraine to announce an investigation into the conspiracy theory that Ukrainian actors, not Russians, meddled in the 2016 election. Almost immediately after Trump was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate last week, Republicans returned to investigating the unsubstantiated corruption allegations against the Bidens. There is no evidence of wrongdoing. \u201cRudy Giuliani is a well-known man. He\u2019s a crime fighter. He\u2019s loyal to the president,\u201d Graham also said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good lawyer. But what I\u2019m trying to say \u2013 to the president and anybody else \u2013 that the Russians are still up to it.\u201d In Graham\u2019s interview on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, he revealed that his conversation with Barr took place earlier on Sunday morning. He also spoke with the Senate intelligence committee chair, Richard Burr. Both \u201ctold me: \u2018Take very cautiously anything coming out of the Ukraine against anybody.\u2019 \u201cAfter talking to the attorney general and the intelligence chairman that any documents coming out of the Ukraine against any American, Republican or Democrat, need to be looked at by the intelligence services, who has expertise I don\u2019t, because Russia is playing us all like a fiddle.\u201d Graham said \u201cno\u201d when asked if the justice department had been ordered to investigate the Bidens. Graham also said the possibility of conflicts of interest involving the Bidens should be examined, but once again emphasized caution, saying: \u201cWhen it comes to documents coming out of the Ukraine, to Republicans and Democrats, be very cautious turning \u2026 anything over you got over to the intel community. \u201cI\u2019m telling Rudy, you think you got the goods? Don\u2019t give it to me, because what do we know? We know that the Russian disinformation campaign was used against President Trump,\u201d Graham also said. \u201cThey hacked into the DNC system. Not the Ukrainians, and they\u2019re on the ground all over the world trying to affect democracy all over the world.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s paying Rudy Giuliani?\u201d host Margaret Brennan asked. \u201c I don\u2019t know,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHere\u2019s my message to Rudy: if you\u2019ve got something coming from the Ukraine, turn it over to the intelligence people, the Department of Justice, to any Democrat.\u201d Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Twitter this morning, Giuliani alluded to \u201ctwo smoking gun documents\u201d in a post urging people to subscribe to his podcast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
