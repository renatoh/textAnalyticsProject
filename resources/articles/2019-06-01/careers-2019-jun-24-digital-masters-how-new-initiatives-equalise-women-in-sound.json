Even the language used is often gendered: \u201cthe sound guy\u201d. Technical roles in music in general \u2013 producers and mixers, for example \u2013 are almost always perceived as the realm of men. Like most stereotypes, this has a basis in fact \u2013 in both North America and the UK, for example, it\u2019s a regularly repeated statistic that less than 5% of audio engineers are women. Unfortunately, this is not a number that has changed with any great significance over the past two decades. So what is it about music tech that makes the numbers so strikingly disparate between men and women? In part, it might well be a self-fulfilling stereotype. Firstly, a lack of representation might make it seem an impossible pursuit. Marta Salogni is a professional sound engineer, producer and mixer, whose body of work includes recordings with the likes of The xx, Frank Ocean and Bj\u00f6rk. Now based in London, it was back in her village in Lombardy, Italy, aged 16, when she became fascinated with the concept of sound engineering. \u201cIt made me a little bit scared because I couldn\u2019t cling on to any role model \u2013 there was no one to demonstrate that that career was possible, and I felt alone a lot of the time.\u201d In turn, she says, this may have been what pushed her to find other people like her, and to succeed so that it became more normal to see women in these spaces. It\u2019s been a fruitful pursuit \u2013 Salogni is one of the most high-profile women in the field in Europe, and yet she finds this a strange position to be in. \u201cGoing into this profession knowing you\u2019re going to be unique means you\u2019re put under a spotlight automatically,\u201d she sighs. \u201cBeing told: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve never worked with a woman before\u2019 doesn\u2019t feel like a compliment \u2013 it just makes me feel like I have to do a lot of work to rebalance this whole mess.\u201d Salogni also says the concept of what a recording studio used to be like at the height of rock\u2019n\u2019roll patriarchy (\u201ca sexist man cave\u201d) can still affect the dynamic, not only in terms of how she feels in that space, but how she is perceived there \u2013 she notes that if women are expecting to feel uncomfortable in a space, then not all of them are going to be up for fighting to be there. \u201cPeople have come to the studio, they\u2019ll look around and try to understand why I\u2019m there, what my role could be. And you can feel that on yourself, obviously \u2013 that person is doubting you,\u201d Salogni says. \u201cSubconsciously, I hold on to that prejudice \u2013 I used to be really worried people would come into the studio and think I was not good enough, because I am a woman, or that I\u2019m not in charge, because I\u2019m a woman.\u201d While representation is important, waiting on meritocracy isn\u2019t enough to redress the balance, Salogni says, alluding to the necessity for positive discrimination. More and more schemes are coming into place to try to make this a reality \u2013 Spotify launched the EQL Directory in association with organisation SoundGirls last year, providing a list of women and gender non-conforming audio professionals. It is, as SoundGirls say on their website, \u201ca useful tool when people say \u2018they want to hire women but can\u2019t find any.\u2019\u201d Then there are organisations such as Saffron \u2013 a Bristol-based group that\u2019s part record label and part educational facility for women, founded by Laura Lewis-Paul in 2015. Among other things, Saffron runs \u201cSaffron For Sound\u201d, women-only courses in partnership with dBs \u2013 a local music college \u2013 teaching about music production software such as Ableton and Logic, as well as studio engineering. Lizzy Ellis from the organisation explains: \u201cWhen I did music tech at college, I was the only girl in the class \u2013 so I think we\u2019ve certainly managed to create an environment that\u2019s much less intimidating for women, that\u2019s accepting people wherever they\u2019re at.\u201d In addition to the issues of representation and a potential lack of respect from men in the industry, Ellis posits that jobs in sound engineering can often require \u201cunsociable and long hours\u201d, especially for those working in the live arena who might be on touring crews for long periods of time. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sit with the standard idea of a family setup for women \u2013 which shouldn\u2019t make a difference, but, unfortunately, it often does. That\u2019s part of a much wider conversation, obviously.\u201d Both Salogni and Ellis are also aware that the push for inclusivity in the audiosphere needs to go beyond talking about women, too \u2013 no statistics exist specifically breaking down the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and/or working class women in these spaces, but Salogni notes the space is one dominated by \u201cmiddle-class white people\u201d. For now, hopefully initiatives such as Spotify and SoundGirls\u2019 EQL Directory, development platforms such as Saffron, and women dominating in the field can help push the conversation forward. The 5% statistic is one that Salogni laughs off \u2013 she\u2019s heard it so many times. \u201cHopefully in 10 years\u2019 time, we\u2019ll be closer to 50-50 and women won\u2019t have to do interviews about this any more.\u201d Everything you need to know about sound engineering Sound engineering is the process by which all the elements of audio or a live performance are recorded and/or pieced together to sound as refined as possible: so that\u2019s everything from knowing the acoustics of a room, to deciding on the levels, knowing which microphones to use and where best to place them. Producing was once a very separate role from engineering but, increasingly, it now crosses over. Producers work with the artist on the track in a less technical way, helping to make the artistic choices \u2013 so it\u2019s making the track the best it can be, but on a compositional level. For example, choosing the instrument that might sound best, suggesting a different song structure, and coaxing the best performance out of an artist. Often, sound engineers are also the mixers \u2013 although this too can be a separate job. Mixing is the final stage \u2013 once the recording is finished, the mixer will take the files, or the tape, and create a balanced composition. So, say there were nine microphones recording one guitar, the mixer would have to take these nine different recordings and mix them together, and then \u2013 depending on what the composition calls for \u2013 mix in the other instruments, vocals, etc. They are also in charge of making the choices on volume levels and additional effects. If you\u2019ve watched Netflix documentary The Defiant Ones, you will be aware there was once a time when simply being available at all hours and learning by practising was how you became a sound engineer. Nowadays, things are very different \u2013 in most cases, specific training is required in the appropriate technology and software (Pro Tools, for example), be that in a higher education institution or an apprenticeship scheme. According to PayScale, the average salary for a sound engineer is \u00a325,000 per annum, with stats suggesting the gender divide is now 95% men and 5% women.
