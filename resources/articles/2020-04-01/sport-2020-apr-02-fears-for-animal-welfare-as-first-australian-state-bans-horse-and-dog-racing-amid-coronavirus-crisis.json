Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein announced the ban on Thursday, cancelling all race meetings for four weeks but allowing training facilities and people responsible for the care and wellbeing of the animals to continue operating. Explaining the decision, which followed an outbreak of Covid-19 in the regional hub of Devonport, Gutwein said he was concerned that large groups of people were continuing to gather at the races, even though spectators have been banned. \u201cMany of them live in regional and rural Tasmania; what we don\u2019t want to do is to increase the risk to those regional and rural communities,\u201d he told reporters in Hobart. \u201cEffective immediately, racing in Tasmania will cease.\u201d The Tasmanian ban comes as the horse industry has warned of an \u201canimal welfare tsunami\u201d caused by the coronavirus shutdowns which they say could see animals neglected or sent to slaughter by owners who can no longer care for them. Horse and dog racing has been allowed to continue in Australia, without crowds and with reduced fields. Ireland shut down racing last week, following the United Kingdom. Hong Kong and Japan are still running. New South Wales Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has called on other states to follow Tasmania\u2019s lead, saying it was \u201cabsolutely crazy that greyhound and horse racing is continuing in the middle of a global pandemic\u201d. Racing Victoria said it would continue racing after Victoria introduced tough stage-three social distancing laws this week. Jamie Stier, the executive general manager of integrity services, said the industry was \u201ccontinually reviewing our biosecurity protocols\u201d and \u201clearning from our collective experiences over the past three weeks\u201d. Both thoroughbred and harness racing was suspended last week due to coronavirus scares, but the sport resumed when tests were returned negative. If racing is shut down, there are potentially more than 20,000 horses that would need to be moved from trainers\u2019 properties \u2013 where the daily cost to owners is higher \u2013 to studs and other agistment farms. Tom Reilly, the chief executive of Thoroughbred Breeders Australia, said stud and agistment farms were looking at ways to increase capacity \u201cif the need arose\u201d. \u201cNobody quite knows what the capacity is for farms to take horses leaving racing because we\u2019ve never been in a position whereby, if there was a shutdown of racing, so many would be leaving at one time,\u201d he said. RSPCA chief scientist Bidda Jones said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that horse racing would be suspended in Australia. Jones said the RSPCA did not think it was essential that horse racing be allowed to continue. But she said those whose job it is to provide basic care for horses, including feeding, grooming and exercising, should be listed as essential workers. Jones said a shutdown posed \u201ca huge risk\u201d to horse welfare and the industry needed to prepare so it was not attempting to retire a large number of horses at once. Julie Fiedler from Horse SA said that widespread job losses caused by the shutdown of the hospitality industry and other coronavirus control measures would cause a \u201csilent animal welfare tsunami\u201d as people became unable to afford to care for their horses. Major saleyards such as Echuca and Pakenham in Victoria have suspended their horse sales, leaving knackeries the only option for a quick sale. \u201cIf it goes on for an extended period of time, people are going to have to reevaluate the cost of keeping a horse,\u201d she said. Shutting down racing could see the accelerated retirement of a number of horses, at a time when retrainers are unable to take them on. \u201cDefinitely keeping the racing industry going is better for horses at the moment,\u201d Fiedler said. Reilly said the thoroughbred industry was also concerned about the impact of a recession, saying \u201cit\u2019s clear everybody understands this is a possible issue and that we need to be looking at what the impacts will be from a welfare perspective\u201d. The industry last year committed to improving outcomes for horses retiring from racing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
