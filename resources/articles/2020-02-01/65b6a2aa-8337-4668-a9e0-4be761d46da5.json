Weinstein, 67, who could be sentenced to as much as 29 years in prison after a jury in New York found him guilty of rape and sexual assault on Monday, also faces a series of claims that he abused women during regular visits to London over the past four decades. \u201cThis is the day that truth has won. This is a momentous day and this is the day that hiding behind vicious, petty, transactional defence was slaughtered,\u201d said the actor Lysette Anthony, who alleges that Weinstein raped her at her London home in the 1980s. \u201cThat\u2019s what we did and I am very proud to be part with you all.\u201d The Hollyoaks star paid tribute to the women who testified in court and attacked Weinstein\u2019s defence team for the way they attempted to shield a \u201cvery rich, serial, predatory rapist\u201d. Jill Greenfield, a partner at the London law firm Fieldfisher, is representing six women in civil compensation claims against Weinstein. She said the producer\u2019s conviction was \u201cfantastic news\u201d and \u201ca relief for everybody\u201d. She said: \u201cPeople underestimate the way in which juries can see through these things. Lots of women don\u2019t get to bring claims for sexual assaults, but they should.\u201d Greenfield said British police were still investigating the claims against Weinstein. Anthony went on: \u201cThis is a seismic moment for victims of sexual assault around the world. Victim-blaming is too easy a sport and the arrogance with which the victims were dealt with was distasteful. \u201cThe important thing here is that these women have been believed \u2013 that is a hugely positive message to send to anyone who has been a victim of sexual assault. All credit to the jury for seeing the truth of the situation. \u201cThis will change the way people perceive rape within a so-called relationship and make it easier for women to report rape who had feared previously they wouldn\u2019t be believed. No one is above the law \u2013 not even Harvey Weinstein.\u201d Rowena Chiu, Weinstein\u2019s former assistant and one of the British women who alleges he sexually abused her, said: \u201cI\u2019m staggered that it took over 100 brave women to come forward, six of whom harrowingly had to take the stand, only to achieve some measure of justice.\u201d Following the verdict, Chiu said it was \u201csurreal\u201d to hear Weinstein had been led away to prison in handcuffs, where he will now await sentencing on 11 March. She added that it had been a \u201cmomentous day\u201d but was puzzled that the jury found Weinstein not guilty on the most serious charges of predatory sexual assault. Chiu called it \u201cpartial justice\u201d, but added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to diminish the accomplishments of these six women and the solidarity and sisterhood that the group of survivors have. They\u2019ve come together and called for a common goal. So, obviously, today is momentous and I don\u2019t want to take away from that.\u201d She said she had been expecting an acquittal. \u201cYou\u2019re often expecting the worst and I feel hugely relieved and somewhat vindicated that there\u2019s been some conviction.\u201d Chiu, who worked for Weinstein in the 1990s, accuses him of attempted rape. He has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers have already said they will appeal in the New York case. He is also facing charges in Los Angeles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
