Propriety deems it impolite to reveal their discussion, but it can be assumed it did not centre around how best to dismiss Sachin Tendulkar. Hussain's sheer professionalism has been one of the most impressive features of his captaincy, so he should not be chided too seriously, and his efforts on English cricket's behalf deserved an OBE, if you believe in such things. But even in cricket's overcrowded schedule, a more convenient time might have been found for him to come over all ceremonial. Such is the nation's obsession with the Windsors, however, since the death of the Queen Mother, the jubilee celebrations and enough fawning newspaper pull-outs to merit half-a-dozen new recycling plants, that cricket can perhaps be forgiven for milking its links with royalty. Even Consignia has come to its senses on that one. It could also have been worse. Had Alec Stewart been the honoured England captain, his press conference would probably have involved a 12-gun salute and everyone standing for the national anthem. All we had to endure yesterday was a half-hour delay so Hussain could \"go live\" on Sky TV. England and India have met nine times in one-day matches in the last seven months and have won four apiece, plus last week's abandonment at Chester-le-Street. The strange thing is that during that time the reputations of both sides have grown immeasurably. Were they to keep playing each other until Christmas, they would be regaled long before the end as certain World Cup finalists. The improvements are real: India's fielding has sharpened up, Yuvraj Singh has brought power to their middle order and a youthful pace attack is making strides. As for England, their one-day batting line-up possesses a more convincing depth than for some years. England have achieved that in slightly fortuitous fashion. The coach, Duncan Fletcher, deserves recognition for Andrew Flintoff's development as a fast bowler with destructive batting potential, and for the progress of Paul Collingwood. But that Stewart remains fit, in form, and balancing the side in a way the likes of James Foster could not have done, is largely down to his own determination to resist calls for retirement. Then there is Ronnie Irani. Hussain stated confidently yesterday that \"we are closer than ever to knowing our World Cup squad\", but he rightly held up Irani as an example to those still hoping to force their way into contention. Two months ago Irani was regarded as just another half-decent county pro; today he goes into the final as the leader in the NatWest internet poll that will determine the supporters' player of the series. Rahul Dravid and Hussain are Irani's closest rivals, and any theories as to why would be greatly appreciated. Stewart's survival, the bounty of Irani, and even the call-up, as cover, of Dominic Cork... for all the accolades given last winter to Rod Marsh's first Academy intake, it is the more seasoned players who have made their mark this summer. Hussain is right to say ability and form should be the only criteria. \"The form players just happen to be in their late 20s and upwards this summer,\" he said. \"They are the ones continually performing. We would not be fair to them, ourselves or county cricket if we said we couldn't pick them because they are 30.\" Graham Thorpe is one thirtysomething whose career has again lost its sparkle. He has missed the last three matches, initially because of ankle trouble, and is a far-from-likely starter today, with England tempted to keep faith in Michael Vaughan's burgeoning attacking style and Collingwood's all-round combative qualities. India, in Hussain's eyes, are \"the form side\", but strange things happen to them in one-day finals. They have lost their last nine and Sourav Ganguly, their captain, has yet to lift a one-day trophy. This really is a desperately difficult one to call. It is only to be hoped it does not come down to the toss. England (probable): Hussain (capt), Trescothick, Knight, Vaughan, Irani, Stewart, Flintoff, Collingwood, Giles, Gough, Tudor/Hoggard. India (probable): Ganguly (capt), Sehwag, Mongia, Tendulkar, Dravid, Yuvraj, Kaif, Agarkar, Kumble/Harbhajan, Nehra, Zaheer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
