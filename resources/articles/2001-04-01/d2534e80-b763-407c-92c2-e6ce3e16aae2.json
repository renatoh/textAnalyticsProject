The company employs over 2,000 people in the UK, but has not said how many of its British workers will face redundancy. Ericsson, which has been hit by a slowing telecoms market employs staff at sites in London, Basingstoke, Guildford and Brighton. A spokesman said more than half of the job cuts would be outside Sweden. Last month it announced plans to axe 1,200 jobs in Carlton, Nottinghamshire and Scunthorpe Officials from the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union are planning to hold meetings with Ericsson today. National officer Bob Shannon said: \"We have made it clear to Ericsson that they cannot keep cutting jobs in this country. It is essential that the firm holds its nerve in the face of the current problems.\" Details of the cuts came as Ericsson issued a first-quarter trading statement saying it was hit by the general economic downturn and an \"abruptly slower telecom sector\". Sales for the period from January to March dropped 5% to \u00a33.8 billion, while income before tax fell 90% from \u00a3418 million to \u00a341.5 million. A spokesman for Ericsson said: \"The fact is the market in telecoms is hardly growing at all, and there is no way a company can ignore that fact.\" To turn its business around, Ericsson plans to cut its costs by more than \u00a31.4 billion a year, by reducing its selling and administrative expenses as well as cutting its number of offices, consultants and staff. It will also spend less on IT, and will consolidate its number of research and development locations. The cuts follow similar announcements by rivals Motorola, Siemens and Marconi. However, Ericsson\u00cds figures were in contrast to data from the Finish telecoms group Nokia, which showed that profits for its first quarter rose nearly 10%.
