Given personal crises in the 1960s and 1970s, he could have wound up being known only for playing one of the greatest British sax solos on Starless and Bible Black for Stan Tracey's 1964 Under Milk Wood suite, but at 70, Wellins is playing as well as ever, maybe better. This set was recorded at last year's Appleby jazz festival, and finds him on confident form. From the first Rollins-like blurts and insouciant sketching-in of a minimal Festival Blues, through sophisticated duets with regular pianist Mark Edwards, to an uptempo Latin rattle turning straightahead on Mad About the Boy and a galloping Fascinating Rhythm, this quartet gets bop-based jazz the best publicity. The breezy momentum of bassist Andy Cleyndert and the unfussy swing of drummer Spike Wells drive it, and Edwards has a provocative role, somewhere between Tracey and Abdullah Ibrahim."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
