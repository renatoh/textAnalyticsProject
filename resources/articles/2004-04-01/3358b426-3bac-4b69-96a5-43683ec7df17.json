For the rest of his life he exercised a judicious censorship over his work, and made no secret of his reluctance to appoint a biographer. His official biographer, the long-suffering Norman Sherry, has spent more than 20 years doing research around the world, enduring gangrene in Panama and even temporary blindness in Africa. Sherry's first 800-page volume emerged in 1989. \"Why does he waste so much time talking about me?\" Greene grumbled, though secretly he delighted in Sherry's tribulations and spaniel-like devotion to the task. After Greene died in 1991, at the age of 87, more biographies were added to a slew of posthumously published film reviews, travel reports and other Greeneana. In hot-foot competition with Sherry, the American academic Michael Shelden offered a life study, Graham Greene: The Enemy Within (1994), which sought to expose a darker shade of Greene. Shelden went to great lengths to arraign his subject on charges of sadism, anti-semitism and alcoholism. Reportedly Greene had indulged in heterosexual buggery in Jamaica (\"Such disgusting sheets\") and enjoyed adulterous copulation on church altars in Italy. All this was probably wild surmise, and certainly unsourced. However, Shelden was not the only biographer to challenge Sherry's monopoly. In the race to trounce Sherry, a third man intervened: Anthony Mockler. Mockler's Graham Greene: Three Lives , issued in 1994, was the loopiest biography to have descended on Greeneland. The cover proclaimed: \"Novelist! Explorer! Spy!\", and Mockler's description of Greene on his Swiss deathbed was accordingly Boy's Own in tone: \"Graham looked out of the antiseptic room over the sterile Swiss sky. No vultures gazed back . . .\" Since when have vultures gazed back anywhere in Vevey? Mockler's book was originally due to be published at the same time as Sherry's first tome, but was withdrawn when Greene took legal action (he referred to Mockler as \"unspeakable\"). Clearly, the shabby, vulture-ridden world of Greene's African and Latin American novels can exert a powerful spell. The priest who administered the last rites to Greene in Switzerland, Father Leopoldo Duran, confessed to rummaging through the writer's waste-paper basket in search of interesting letters; his memoir, Graham Greene: Friend and Brother (1994), was distinguished by its excess of adoration and dullness. Other books followed. In 2000, the Australian writer Shirley Hazzard published a precious but mercifully brief recollection of the English novelist, Greene on Capri (2000), which claimed a great friendship. What next? Yvonne Cloetta, Greene's French lover of 30 years, has produced a bewitching if occasionally bland reminiscence of the writer, In Search of a Beginning . The book is clearly intended as a riposte to Greene's various biographers and memoirists, and Cloetta pulls no punches as she subjects Shelden, Sherry and Hazzard to repeated cannonades. Sherry emerges from these pages as a locker-room snoop, digging and hustling for information, but Shelden is positively tossed and gored in a spirit, I suspect, of vengeance. His book is \"nothing but a grotesque and obscene mockery\", Cloetta fumes. Shelden had promised her a \"sympathetic biography\" but instead accused Greene of complicity in the gruesome 1930s Brighton murder (to this day unsolved) of a pregnant woman whose dismembered body was found in two suitcases. \"Oh come on, this is so spicy!\" Cloetta neatly refutes these and other scabrous fantasies. As well as providing a corrective to Shelden and company, In Search of a Beginning offers an absorbing portrait of the pleasures, foibles and often eccentric dislikes of Greene the man. He had a superstitious dread of the letter C (the boy who bullied him at school, tellingly, was called Carter), and liked the taste of lipstick tainted with vodka. Above all, this book is the record of a love affair that endured. Greene first met Cloetta on a visit to the French Cameroon in 1959. She was then married to a wealthy businessman based in Africa and, by her own account, immersed in a life of sated boredom. The meeting seems to have been the classic coup de foudre . Cloetta, sylish, blonde, petite, captivated Greene and, in a decorous way, he began to court her. At 55, Greene was 20 years older than Cloetta, unhappily married and, he felt, on the ebb-tide of his achievements. His greatest work - Brighton Rock, The Heart of the Matter, The End of the Affair, The Quiet American - was behind him. Few novelists had fathomed with such intensity the suffering and dark places of this earth. Yet Cloetta was able to ease Greene through his brooding, introspective moods, and became his lifelong counsellor and confidante. She oversaw French translations of his books, suggested titles for them and even edited the journal he kept of his dreams, A World of My Own, published posthumously in 1992. (In Greene's most entertaining dream, Queen Elizabeth II confides of her husband: \"I can't bear the way he smiles.\") Throughout their life together, Greene repeatedly told Cloetta: \"I love you for ever - and the longest day\", meaning eternity. To judge by In Search of a Beginning, Cloetta had considerable wit, a capacity for terse put-downs and a gift for coquettish fun that excited as much as consoled Greene. In 1963, sailing to Haiti from Jamaica, Greene wrote to her: \"I get in awful moods of melancholy and doom,\" but added tenderly: \"It's too long to wait to see you.\" Three years later, in 1966, the novelist left England and settled permanently in Antibes to be near his French mistress. Though not an intellectual (a word Greene disliked), Cloetta proves to be a match for the French journalist Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Allain, whose interviews make up this book. Greene was fascinated with what remained outside his class and culture - whether opium dens in Chinese Saigon, or blue films in Batista's Cuba - and indeed sleaze acted as a forceful stimulant on his imagination. Cloetta remarks on Greene's predilection for brothels but also his hatred of anything that \"violated human dignity\". Over the 60 years of his literary career, Greene rallied to the defence of the underdog, sabre drawn. His greatest \"emotional struggle\", notes Cloetta, was on behalf of the Haitian people, whom he got to know in 1957 and later immortalised in his great hot-house entertainment, The Comedians . Yvonne Cloetta did not live to see publication of In Search of a Beginning , as she died in 2001. Yet she can be proud of this book. Euan Cameron, for many years a director of Greene's British publisher, The Bodley Head, has translated her words seamlessly. As for the authorised Sherry, Greene is believed to have told him over dry martinis: \"Norman, I shall be alive for volume one of your biography, but I shall die before volume two. And you, my dear Norman, will not live to see completion of volume three.\" Greene was right about volumes one and two but not, we trust, about the third and final volume, which is due out this autumn. Ian Thomson's travel book on Haiti, Bonjour Blanc, is reissued next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
