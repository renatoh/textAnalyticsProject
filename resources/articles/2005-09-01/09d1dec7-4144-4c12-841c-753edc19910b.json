Probably. By \"colder\", the weather forecasters mean colder than the average of all the last 50 winters. By \"probably\", they mean a likelihood of two thirds. It's better than tossing a coin. If you were planning a white Christmas in the Black Forest in December, a stroll on the South Downs in January or a St Valentine's Day picnic on a Breton beach in February, it wouldn't be much help. But if you were a local authority wondering about grit and salt for roads, an agribusiness buying winter feed for yarded cattle, a public utility trying to forecast electricity demand or a reinsurance giant bothered about the billion-dollar payouts for windstorms, floods, ice storms and avalanches, you'd be grateful for the warning. And you'd owe it all to a crazy 150-year-old ambition to understand how the planet works and to a sea change - quite literally - in weather forecasting. In order to look ahead for months rather than days, forecasters look beyond the hour-by-hour snapshots of the planet provided by weather satellites and ground stations, and start examining tiny changes in air pressure over Iceland and the Azores, not just over days and months, but years and decades. These enigmatic fluctuations are in their turn a record of tiny shifts - differences of less than 1C - in the temperatures of waters of the north Atlantic. The meteorologists and climate scientists call it the North Atlantic Oscillation. They don't really know why it happens, but they know what it does: it dictates whether Europe's winters are wet and warm, or cold and snowy. This works, baldly, because the biggest thing on the planet is the ocean: it stores the sun's heat and shifts it slowly around the globe in currents such as the Gulf Stream, which keeps Britain about 5C warmer than the average for other parts of the globe at this latitude. Changes in ocean temperature translate into changes in air pressure, which in turn drive winds and rain and deliver hail, snow and ice to one sector of a continent and fry another bit to levels that make forest fires an all-summer hazard. The trick is to see the changes coming. Long-range weather forecasting is a business that attracts both the eccentric and the serious. The Old Farmer's Almanac in the US, for instance, offers year-long forecasts based on \"a secret formula devised in 1792\"; another self-styled media forecaster in south London offers forecasts based on \"predictable effects of solar activity\". But most of the professionals - the government-funded and university-backed climate scientists and meteorologists - make more guarded claims and base them on meticulous measurements of tiny changes in sea temperatures that can send category 5 hurricanes roaring to the coasts of America or kill, by the thousand, the old, the lonely and the sick in Europe with heat waves or prolonged cold snaps. The data, as climate scientists point out, can be as precise as you like; it is the predictions based on those data that tend to be a bit more difficult. That is because the world's climate is a dynamic system, changing before your eyes. \"Because we are doing predictions six months ahead, we have to allow for the changes in ocean temperatures that are occurring over those six-month periods. When we are doing short-term forecasts we don't have to worry about that,\" says Chris Gordon, of the Met Office's Hadley Centre, and one of the team that works on next year's weather. \"When you are trying to forecast for six months ahead you are not going to be saying it is going to be sunny on a Wednesday afternoon in six months' time or whatever. You are basically forecasting climate. What we are doing is forecasting - in technical terms - a probability that something might happen.\" And then comes the added extra ingredient: skill. Skill is weather forecasters' shorthand for introducing a measure of precision to the probability, and what turns a random gamble into a slightly sounder bet. The forecasters study current form - the present state of the oceans and the atmosphere - then put the data into supercomputers that can make billions of calculations a second and fast-forward the weather for days, weeks and months. They can take a guess at how good their forecasts might be by doing a few hindcasts: by looking back in time at what their computer might have predicted last year or the year before. And then they plug in another, simpler set of observations: the surface temperatures of the oceans. They look at the link between past temperatures and past changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation and try to calculate just what effect the sea surfaces now will have on urban thermostats thousands of miles away, five months hence. \"That's the one that is reliable two times out of three,\" says Gordon. \"It is only two times out of three.\" That bet may not look very tempting to a gambler, but huge sums ride on it all the same. Last year, Munich Re, the reinsurance giant, calculated that 98% of all the economic losses due to natural disasters in 2004 were linked to the weather. For insured losses, the link was 100%. And there is every sign that things are getting worse. Nine of the 10 hottest years ever recorded have occurred in the past decade. More heat means warmer oceans, which means more evaporation, which in turn drives dramatic temperature and pressure changes that set up more extreme weather events. Each little shift in sea temperatures in the Atlantic has meant that ocean storms have more become violent, with more devastating consequences with each landfall. In the northern hemisphere, spring now arrives earlier and autumn later, and for the past few years winters have been mild and sometimes even relatively warm. But warmer oceans mean more than just scarier typhoons in the Pacific or more destructive hurricanes on the Atlantic coast of America. The North Atlantic Oscillation controls the weather in Greenland, Canada and the eastern United States. Another cyclic monster, called El Ni\u00f1o - a huge blister of unusual warmth in the equatorial Pacific that seems to appear every decade - can delay the monsoon rains in India, trigger fires in the rainforests of Borneo, blight the maize harvest in Africa and deliver catastrophic rainfall to the southern-Californian coast. The impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation is less dramatic, and therefore less easy to detect and, of course, therefore more difficult to predict. \"The big issue with all of this - and it's a tricky one - is that people have got very used to weather forecasts which say tomorrow it is going to rain, or not. It's a definite forecast. This is different. This really is probability. To say it is right two thirds of the time is to say it is going to be wrong a lot of the time too,\" says Gordon. \"People of course think that the Met Office is saying it is going to be a cold winter. Well, we are, but not with a great deal of confidence\". Heatwaves, hurricanes and other foolish forecasts May 2005 On May 11 this year, the Department of Health issued Heatwave, a survival guide to coping with the predicted high temperatures. The health warning was based on the latest seasonal forecast from the Met Office, which suggested that temperatures were likely to be unusually high, with potentially devastating consequences. However, the average temperature was 19C, only half a degree higher than the average daily maximum of 18.4C. The highest recorded temperature for the year was 33.1C on June 19, which still does not surpass the record temperature of 38.5C reached on August 10 2003, during the summer heatwave. October 1987 hurricane Long-range weather forecasters faced criticism for failing to predict the 1987 hurricane. The night before, BBC weatherman Michael Fish famously reassured viewers that the system would track along the English Channel but instead it cut a swath right across the south of the country. The storm ranks as the fourth most severe storm to hit Britain since records began. It cost a total of 18 lives, \u00a31bn in repairs/clear-up costs and destroyed 15 million trees. November 1999 Researchers predicted that winter 2000 would see a 20% above average number of \"strong gale\" and \"whole gale\" force winds. The research came from UK scientists Steven George and Dr Mark Saunders of University College London, who predicted that the south-east and east of England would see above average gales from December through to March, with Wales and the west of England also seeing above-average wind speeds. Their long-term gale forecast was the first to be approved by the UK Met Office and had proved accurate in predicting hurricanes in the US. In April 2000, gale force winds blew snow into drifts of up to 1.52m in depth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
