Yet his team-mate Mark Webber raised the bar on what promises to be keen inter-team rivalry by setting the fourth fastest time, 0.3 seconds faster than Wilson, to end the day behind the Williams-BMWs of Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya, and Jarno Trulli's Renault. Wilson is a cool customer. With the track temperature just below the 40C mark, he emerged from the confines of the Jaguar R4's cockpit without a bead of sweat, his overalls looking as fresh as the moment they'd arrived from the suppliers. \"That was awesome,\" he enthused. \"It's pretty unusual to see yourself in seventh place having outqualified Michael Schumacher on what is my first full day on the job with Jaguar. The car felt fantastic over that one flying lap and I was under enough pressure to begin with, but when Mark went out and set fourth fastest time, it changed the goal posts completely. \"I didn't think seventh place was possible, but thanks to a good clean lap, and the excellent handling balance of the car, the team was rewarded with both cars in the top seven. It's good, but I still have a very steep learning curve ahead.\" In purely technical terms the first qualifying session suggests Michelin has the edge over Bridgestone at Hockenheim, the best-placed runners on the Japanese tyres being the Ferraris of Rubens Barrichello and Michael Schumacher in eighth and ninth places. Bridgestone had the upper hand at Silverstone as sustained lateral high G-cornering was the priority, but the first signs are that the Michelin rubber may be better suited to the \"stop-start\" configuration of Hockenheim where tight corners are linked by relatively short straights. Bridgestone is concentrating on a less stiff carcass construction than before, which suits Ferrari, but not necessarily its other teams. Behind them, the next Bridgestone runner was Jenson Button's BAR-Honda in 12th spot. The fans seemed evenly split over their devotion to engine suppliers BMW and Mercedes, but as far as personalities were concerned the Michael Schumacher supporters had the numerical edge over fans of his brother Ralf. \"The German fans over 25 or 30, wealthy and successful people, seem particularly to love Michael,\" said Willi Weber, the Stuttgart-based entrepreneur who has managed the careers of both Schumacher brothers from the start. \"He is an idol, because he's a member of the establishment who's proved that it is possible to come up from nothing to become a successful international sportsman. He is analytical and a hard working guy. \"Ralf appeals to the teenagers as well as the older fans because he's a sunny boy, undiplomatic and speaks his mind. He's completely different and much more direct than his brother. They are very different.\" \u00b7 Jordan have retreated from their attempt to take on Vodafone, abandoning their \u00a3150m lawsuit that accused the company of reneging on a sponsorship deal and offering to pay costs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
