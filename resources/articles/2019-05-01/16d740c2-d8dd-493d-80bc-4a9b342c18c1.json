Most of the panel discussion revolved around Chalmers, who confirmed he was considering nominating for Labor\u2019s leadership ballot. Chalmers was repeatedly backed into a corner when asked how his party\u2019s platform might shift in the aftermath of the disappointing result on Saturday. He was forced to acknowledge that something needed to change but unable yet to say what those changes might be. \u201cAll of these policies after an election loss are up for review, they\u2019re up for discussion,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cWe have to reflect on that, obviously. We\u2019re not going to pretend that we are not going to give consideration to all these policies. \u201cObviously the vote was disappointingly weak. I\u2019m not going to pretend that away, I\u2019m not going to try and sugarcoat that. \u201cOur job now is not to engage in some year-long pity party or drag our arses around, our job now is to rebuild and renew and refresh.\u201d In an episode devoted mainly to campaign inquests, the retiring minister Christopher Pyne said he thought Malcolm Turnbull would have won the election had he not been dumped by the Liberal party last year. \u201cWhat Scott did was \u2026 an amazing achievement. I think Malcolm would have won the election as well. I still believe that. We gave ourselves quite a handicap last August.\u201d Pyne said complaints about Clive Palmer\u2019s advertising spend \u2013 a $60m yellow campaign that heavily attacked the opposition leader Bill Shorten \u2013 were \u201csour grapes\u201d and that the same criticism had not been directed at other third-party electioneering. \u201cA lot of [Palmer\u2019s advertising] was complete and utter rubbish. That\u2019s his business. That\u2019s his business whether he spent $60m. We don\u2019t like what GetUp has done. We don\u2019t like what the ACTU has done. They don\u2019t donate to us. But that\u2019s the way things are.\u201d The business leader Ming Long said she did not think Palmer was \u201cstupid\u201d for spending so much money on a campaign where he polled about 3.4% of the national vote. \u201cHe\u2019s a businessman,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants an investment for that $60m return. It\u2019s important for the journalists and the media in our country to keep an eye on is there a deal. Is he getting some sort of return for that?\u201d The journalist Alice Workman, of the Australian, highlighted how effective the Coalition campaign in regional Queensland had been at capturing concerns from coalminers about jobs. \u201cClimate change means different things to people in inner-cities than it does to people in Queensland,\u201d she said. Chalmers conceded that coal had hurt Labor in key central Queensland marginal seats. \u201cClearly in central Queensland and north Queensland we had a problem and that\u2019s reflected in the results,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would be dishonest if we tried to claim that coal didn\u2019t play a part in that. But nationally, overwhelmingly, we need to deal with climate change. Nationally, renewable energy needs to play a bigger part of the mix.\u201d In a rare hour of air time, particularly one so focused on the climate crisis, the controversial broadcaster Alan Jones managed to say little that was more outlandish than his coral-coloured suit jacket. He aimed a few barbs at Labor, using lines such as the \u201ceconomic suicide note\u201d which he had repeated ad nauseam during the election campaign. Finally, with a few moments of the panel discussion remaining, Jones could contain himself no more, trotting out a convoluted climate denial argument about the trace amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, one refuted by scientists as contrarian nonsense. Workman rolled her eyes and said: \u201cOh my God.\u201d Jones retorted: \u201cAlice, you\u2019ve been speaking for most of the night.\u201d The host, Tony Jones, suggested Jones might need to be fact checked. It was unclear whether he was referring to Workman\u2019s air time, or the need to decipher the broadcaster\u2019s personal climate science."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
