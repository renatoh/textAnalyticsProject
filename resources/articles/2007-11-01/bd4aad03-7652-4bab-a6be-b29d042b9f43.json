When I wasn't working as a receptionist in a busy accident and emergency department, I was out enjoying myself. I loved my job and was thinking about training to be a paramedic. In May 2003, I went on holiday to Greece. The next thing I knew I was in hospital in the UK. I'd been in a coma for three weeks. I can't remember anything about the days leading up to the accident. I later learned that on the last night of my holiday, I'd gone out for a Chinese meal. Someone gave me a lift back on a motorbike, which was involved in a crash. My mum flew out and sat by my bedside. After two weeks, I was flown home. When I came round, my friends were there for me. It was a great comfort. I had suffered a serious brain injury. The doctors were unsure if I'd ever be able to swallow, talk or walk again. I've proved them all wrong. I learned to talk again within weeks, but walking took nearly two years. I had daily physiotherapy and speech and language therapy for 15 months. I told myself, \"I'm going to walk out of this hospital\", and I did. I still use a walking stick, but I am determined to walk unaided at some point in the future. The accident changed my life beyond recognition. I can't train as a paramedic now, but I'd like to train as a counsellor and help people who have been involved in similar situations. I'm now engaged to be married and my partner is very supportive. I still go out with my friends, but I can't go dancing. I miss that. The hardest part is the loss of independence. I have support workers, both at home and at college, who are brilliant, but I miss being able to go out on my own. \u00b7 Hayley Collins is studying computer literacy and information technology at Havering College"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
