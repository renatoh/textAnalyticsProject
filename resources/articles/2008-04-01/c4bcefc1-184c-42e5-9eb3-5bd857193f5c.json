Suddenly the reality is next to you. As it happens, Westwood can also tell you what might happen next. 'In my case what happened next in 1999 was that I fell apart over that back nine. When I saw I was in genuine contention that year I felt like throwing up. That remains probably the most nervous I've ever been on a golf course.' Westwood was still pale when I saw him a few hours later in the clubhouse, fiddling absentmindedly with a glass of something while his manager and mate Andrew 'Chubby' Chandler talked rapidly and softly in an attempt to console his player. Now Westwood, nine years older and at least a bit wiser, is back towards his best, maybe even a tad better than 1999, even if actually winning tournaments has been just outside his reach in the past year. Back in 1999 he was the outstanding English golfer of his generation, a cocky, naturally talented player who has been towards the forefront of European golf for so long that even he thinks he is older than he is. There have been blips along the way, of course. The year after that Augusta trial he won five times in Europe to interrupt Colin Montgomerie's long run of Order of Merit titles but then slipped into the sort of apathetic decline that often signals the end for top-class sportsmen. As he slid down the world rankings, a few of us started to wave goodbye, but we were soon offering handshakes to welcome him back. Westwood, 34, crossed the Atlantic yesterday restored to the top 20 in the world rankings. During the lean times he continued to make Ryder Cup teams. Westwood has played in five of these matches and taken part in every segment, a unique record and one that shows what a succession of captains - Seve Ballesteros, Mark James, Sam Torrance, Bernhard Langer and Ian Woosnam - have thought of him both as a player and as a man. Occasionally taciturn, habitually self-deprecating, Westwood suffers fools, and foolish questions, not at all. Some are niggled by this approach, but I like the bloke. This will be his ninth Masters. He has a top finish of sixth (1999) and missed three halfway cuts. A year ago he finished in a tie for 30th: not great, but not bad either. He is, though, a golfer restored, a flurry of top-10 finishes (14 in his last 16 events) adding compelling evidence that he just might be caressing the ball properly, the ability that made him an outstanding prospect in the first place. He also returns to Georgia fitter and leaner, his waist reduced, his tailor rubbing his hands as he counts the money for new gear. This new-look Westwood has his passion for football - he is a fierce Nottingham Forest supporter - to thank for it all. His interest in fitness was ignited when he was introduced to Stephen McGregor by mutual friend David O'Leary, who was managing Aston Villa at the time. McGregor is a specialist football trainer and he has laid down a template for the golfer to improve his 'core stability', working principally on his backside, shoulders and spine. Apart from anything else, this should add healthy years to his career. 'Yeah, I feel good. Good about my game and my life. Eighteen months ago I weighed 95kg [14st 13lb] and had a 40-inch waist. Now the waist is down to 34inches and I weigh nearly 98kg. I'm heavier, but with muscle rather than flab. It's a massive difference. It means I don't get as tired sometimes and it means that I'm hitting the ball a lot farther, about 15 yards more with my driver. And if you're hitting a seven iron into a green rather than a five iron, then it makes this game a lot easier. 'You need distance at Augusta these days. Since they stretched the course [now 7,445 yards], I reckon it's three shots harder than when I first played there. I'll give you a couple of examples. At the 7th I used to hit a three iron down the fairway off the tee, now it's a whack with a wood; and at the 17th I'd be hitting a nine-iron approach to the green but now it's likely to be a five iron. It's tough, really tough. 'There is proper, penalising rough there now and the up-slopes you hit into off the tee really stop the ball. It used to be very much a drawer's course [hitting right to left] but now a straight drive or a fade is better. I like it. A lot. I like anywhere that tests you to the maximum as a player. I've been playing well since last summer now and so my confidence is good, too. I know I haven't won since last year but I'm not bothered about that. I've won enough [29 significant titles so far] to know it's not because I'm afraid of it. I don't think I'll feel like throwing up this time if I'm in contention come Sunday.' Apart from his fitness regime, Westwood also reviewed his coaching options and returned to the man who first set him on his way, his dad, John, a former maths teacher. 'It was in Dubai early last year that I thought I was having too many thoughts about the way I was swinging it. I had my own feelings and then I had all these others I'd been given so I thought I'd go back to looking after myself and having my dad as well. He's always had a good pair of eyes and, of course, he knows me better than anyone.' Westwood also employed Mark Roe, a former European Tour pro and now a Sky TV analyst, to sharpen up his short game. This has always had been the weakest point of Westwood's golf but now, if not world class, it is at least class and getting better. It is something a man needs if he is to survive Augusta for, while length is king, the ability to scramble pars from greenside is the required ace in anyone's hand. As is the ability to keep Georgia on his mind while making sure Tiger Woods stays out of it. This, as ever, is easier said than done. 'We all have to admire Tiger for what he's done in the game, but he does win tournaments sometimes that, really, he shouldn't win. He does this simply because his name goes up on a leaderboard and everyone else goes backwards. That's happened for sure. I've seen this sort of thing before. It used to happen in Europe with Monty when he was in his prime. Suddenly we all began dropping away. 'But I love it when I have a chance to watch him in a tournament. What strikes me most about Tiger is how focused he always is and how positive he remains no matter what is happening and this is something I have to try and grab from him. We all do. When he won the US Open in 2000 by a million shots it gave everyone a kick up the arse and there was a response. Now he is doing it again and, as Vijay Singh has said, we all have to give ourselves another good kick.' Westwood has been practising his kicking back home in Worksop last week. Westwood may fly by private jet, may occasionally wear the sort of purple suit that encourages gentle ridicule in parts of the Nottinghamshire town, but he has never seriously considered leaving his roots behind. He says he finds London too chaotic for his taste, frets that it would 'do my head in' if he lived there full-time and, anyway, he relishes the relative anonymity of Worksop - universal centre, of course, for the production of the Oxo cube. That suit aside, Westwood is as unflash as his mate Darren Clarke is glittery. What is also true is that watching the Clarke family go through their recent anguish as Heather lost her battle with cancer has helped alter Westwood as husband, father and golfer. He knows now that life is unpredictable, that the here and now is the thing. It is part of the reason he embarked on his fitness-and-focus regime 18 months ago and this is why he has to be regarded as a major contender this year. 'Heather's death made me look at my own life. You'd expect that. I'm 35 in a couple of weeks' time and I believe I am ready to begin the second part of my pro career. The next five years, or whatever, should be interesting for me. That's the hope anyway. I've got the experience behind me now. I know what to expect from majors and what I expect is that if you get into contention then you'll find your balls in your throat. The trick is not to choke on them.' Worksop's finest arrives in Augusta not just more experienced but possessing an honorary doctorate from Nottingham Trent University. He is really proud of this, as he should be. A decade ago, when I first interviewed him, Westwood claimed that the only books he had ever read from cover to cover were of the Janet and John variety. No longer. With two young children to entertain, his library is now hugely more extensive. 'I still prefer thinking to books,' he says. 'But I have to admit that Thomas the Tank Engine is a good read, isn't it?' Dr Westwood. Who would have thought it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
