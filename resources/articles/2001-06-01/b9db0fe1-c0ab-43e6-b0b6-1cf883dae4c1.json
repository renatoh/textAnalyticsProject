Inspired by his own experience as a black man raised in east London, the piece traces the fictional journey of a man in search of his roots - fleeing a culture where he feels only half at home for a mythic motherland where he thinks he can be reclaimed. It is a journey traced through dance, music and Jonzi's own rap lyrics, fuelled by the exuberant, sometimes angry force of his stage personality. Each leg of the show is neatly balanced between burlesque and political theatre as he finds his expectations of paradise turning sour with every place he visits. The cockney London he turns his back on may be a jolly world of rhyming slang and football, but the abuse and alienation that go with it make his parents' homeland, Grenada, seem like a haven of hot sun and calypso. When Jonzi arrives, of course, the heat and flies drive him demented and the locals find him a joke. So, disgruntled and sweaty - \"My mother's land is not my motherland\" - the city boy heads for Jamaica. Unfortunately, Jonzi looks like a hobo among the Trenchtown slickers, can barely speak a word of their patois, can't dance their dances and doesn't get their vibe. Another hopeful cliche demolished, he heads for the Bronx home of hip-hop, where he fondly imagines making money out of his rapping skills. The territory turns out to be as ruthlessly carved up as gangland, though, and he is beaten to within an inch of his life. Africa - his mystical home - is his last resort. And it's here that Jonzi learns the lesson that has been waiting for him from the beginning of the show: home is ultimately what's inside him and what he chooses to make of the past. With the support of a versatile group of singers, dancers and musicians, Jonzi navigates the narrative shifts between comedy and political seriousness adroitly, but, at nearly three hours, the show is much too long. It's not just that certain images and ideas are worked to exhaustion, it's also that any show that trades in stereotypes has to move fast. Cliches start to show their holes when they're allowed to hang around too long. As a short piece, Aeroplane Man flew fast, high and funny but, extended too far beyond its natural length, the ride starts out a little bumpy and ends up being dull."}, "isHosted": false}}}
