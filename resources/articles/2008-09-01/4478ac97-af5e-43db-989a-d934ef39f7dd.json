One minute we were stultifying the next we were super. Apparently. Outside the England camp there seemed to be a storm of critical opinion: were we any good? Did the fans still like us? Had we lost our passion for the game? Before the Croatia game we sat among ourselves and talked about it. We couldn't get our heads round it. 'Everyone seems to think we're not going to do well here, why? Why can't they see what we see?' We were not surprised in the slightest by our performance in Zagreb. Before the two games Mr Capello sat us down and reminded us that he has inherited the same squad from his predecessors. There aren't many new faces, and that's because he thinks we are good enough. Of course if he wants to make changes, he will - there were four to the line-up against Croatia. He does not keep favourites, he just chooses the team he thinks will win. This is what I am most impressed with about our manager - his honesty. He says what he feels. He says it to us, and then he says the same to the media. He's prepared to put his view on the line. In the past we have had managers who have muddled communication. With Mr Capello you know exactly what you're dealing with down to the smallest detail. He is so obsessed with football and how he wants us to play the game that he picks up on the tiniest points. If he tells me to throw the ball out quickly that's what he wants and if I'm slow in training he's on me straight away. I like that. There's no ambiguity, you've got strict instructions, consistently, day in, day out. As far as we were concerned, against Andorra we had completed the task that had been asked of us. We were never going to win that game 5-0, and if we had then you can bet your bottom dollar some people would have said it was too easy. We didn't get desperate and think we've got to shut people up, we just had to win. As the manager said to us beforehand, we had to be prepared to play against a team with 10 men behind the ball. It was a defence with one guy left up front, and you're unlikely to see anything different when they come to Wembley. We were glad for the win and that was it. We had been prepared for a difficult encounter and a lot of the lads were of the opinion that Andorra was the trickier game because we were expected to beat them. In the past we have let ourselves down in those fixtures. Of course beating Croatia was awesome and we were all buzzing from it. I don't like to pick out one player but it is fair to say that Theo had a pretty special night. Before the game I told him that I fancied him to score, and then off he went and bagged three, which I thought was rather greedy! Round the England camp we call him Lewis Hamilton, until someone noted that he's probably quicker than Lewis. What I like about Theo is how comfortable and yet unassuming he is. In the papers last week there was a funny picture of him outside his house giving a thumbs-up to the camera with a smile on his face. There was no dodging the paps and giving it the arrogant, 'yeah I've just scored a hat-trick'. It was just a young lad enjoying himself. He really has not changed since the 2006 World Cup. He had his head screwed on even then. Sven obviously saw something in him that's now starting to come to fruition, for which Arsenal must take a lot of credit. But I don't want to jump on the Theo bandwagon because it goes against what the team did. The way Wayne Rooney played all round was crucial for the team. In the past he has been criticised for not scoring enough goals but his contribution in the last two games was worth more than goals. He was very unselfish I thought. My own involvement was limited courtesy of some very good attacking play by us, although we lapsed a little in concentration to allow them to score. Still, everyone was happy that we'd been given a set of objectives and achieved them. For an England team who eats, sleeps and breathes football it is very strange for us to hear this perception that we have lost our passion for the national game. I can't help but get angry about it. You can tell when somebody doesn't give a toss, and you can tell when they do. If you look at the players' faces during the games you see how much it means to them. I won't deny that there are some footballers who are happy just to pick up a paycheque, but there is not one in the England squad - and we don't get paid to play for England anyway, it all goes to charity. We are all feeling very positive right now, but it's still just two games into qualifying. I don't think for a minute the manager would allow us to get ahead of ourselves, and I don't think we would either. We've beaten a decent side well, but the usual hurdles and banana skins are still there. The difference this time around is the manager. There's a new approach to the way we're going to play and it's a good one. I genuinely think England are going to do well and I want to be part of it. There's a new injection, a new feeling in the camp, and I like it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
