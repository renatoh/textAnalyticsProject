That is why we cannot [leave him out]. He is an exceptional player. With his physicality he plays all the minutes. He is one of the most fantastic players I ever had in my career.\u201d After departing Anfield in 2015, reunions with Liverpool have proved emotionally fraught for Sterling but Guardiola hopes the England forward will remind his old club of the immense potential they lost. \u201cHe is a better player than when he arrived,\u201d said Guardiola \u201cHe\u2019s exceptional. I am pretty sure of his mentality and desire to win and improve a lot. He deserves a lot. I wish in three, four, five years he will be a much, much better player than he is today. \u201cWill he be one of best in the world if he carries on improving? My advice, I would say to him don\u2019t think about this. It makes no sense. Just enjoy the life; focus and destiny will dictate who he becomes as a player. It depends on him.\u201d City\u2019s manager was less enthusiastic about the belief that Liverpool have become the most challenging opponents of his coaching career, clearly regarding it as rather parochial. \u201cI will never underestimate all the other opponents in the other leagues,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was in Munich it was Dortmund, with Thomas Tuchel or J\u00fcrgen [Klopp] in the first seasons with incredible teams. When I was in Barcelona, Real Madrid, the rivalry there was so, so tough with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, with Manuel Pellegrini as well.\u201d He also looked back to a 5-3 aggregate defeat against Barcelona, in the 2014-15 Champions League semi-finals. \u201cLuis Enrique, when I played with Bayern Munich in the semi-finals of the Champions League, was the toughest opponent I ever faced. \u201cI have incredible respect for Liverpool and the quality they have. In the past three years the toughest opponents we\u2019ve had in the Premier League were Liverpool. But maybe in a few years City or Liverpool will have a new rival so this will not be eternal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
