The international trade secretary believes there are 400,000 UK businesses that could export but do not, and will try to target them with better loans, guarantees and support \u2013 and ask businesses to spell out what barriers to trade they face. Fox will use a speech on Tuesday to say \u201cthe UK has the potential to be a 21st-century exporting superpower\u201d and lift exports from 30% of GDP. \u201cAs we leave the EU, we must set our sights high,\u201d he will add. The speech comes at a time when businesses are increasingly concerned by the lack of apparent progress in the UK\u2019s exit negotiations with the European Union, as well as ministers\u2019 decision to talk up a no-deal Brexit, which would leave firms scrambling to introduce contingency measures. The Federation of Small Businesses said the export strategy to be unveiled by Fox was \u201cstrong on aspiration\u201d, but added that support from government was urgently needed after a summer in which ministers have said the UK may need to stockpile food and medicines. Mike Cherry, the FSB chairman, said: \u201cThe clock is ticking. If the government doesn\u2019t act quickly and introduce financial incentives there is a risk the current uncertainty will have a serious and detrimental impact.\u201d Shortly after Fox unveils the export strategy, Raab, the Brexit secretary, will return to Brussels to meet the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in the afternoon. Discussions on Tuesday will focus on the UK\u2019s Chequers plan and the future relationship post Brexit. Talks will continue into Wednesday as both sides urgently seek to make progress. Before the meeting, the Department for Exiting the European Union released technical Powerpoint presentations given by UK officials in Brussels on financial services and competition policy. On competition policy, the paper said the UK would seek regulatory alignment with the EU after Brexit. It said the UK was proposing \u201cto make binding commitments to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules on state aid\u201d and would not lower environmental, social and employment standards. The financial services presentation indicated the reverse, that the UK needed an independent approach. It said the UK hosted \u201cthe world\u2019s most significant financial centre\u201d and as a result, rule-taking from the European Union \u201cwill simply not work for this sector\u201d. UK Finance, the trade body for banking and insurers, said Raab and Barnier needed to make progress to ensure cross-border services remained uninterrupted. \u201cGiven the limited time available, it is vital that both UK and EU27 negotiators focus on ensuring a legally enforceable agreement that enables meaningful cross-border market access in financial services,\u201d it said. The pound has been tumbling against major currencies since the spring and is trading at $1.28, its lowest level for a year because of worries about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The deterioration helps make UK exports cheaper, but the import of raw materials and parts more expensive. Exports totalled \u00a3615.9bn last year, according to ONS statistics, with the EU accounting for \u00a3274bn, or 44%, of the total. The US was the largest single country for UK exports, followed by Germany and France."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
