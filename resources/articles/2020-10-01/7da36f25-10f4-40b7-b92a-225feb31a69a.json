Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, last week endorsed calls by the government\u2019s scientific advisers for a two- to three-week shutdown. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has opposed the plan, calling it a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d and warning about the damaging economic impact of shuttering many sectors. But the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, points to analysis, including by the International Monetary Fund, which suggests much of the economic hit from coronavirus comes from \u201cvoluntary distancing\u201d \u2013 the changes in people\u2019s behaviour when they believe the disease is rife. The Labour push for a second nationwide intervention was further bolstered on Tuesday by a Bank of England policymaker who suggested Britain\u2019s virus-stricken economy could benefit from tough controls to bring the disease under control. Warning that there is no simple trade-off between health and the economy, Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of Threadneedle Street\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said it was misleading to argue that Britain\u2019s economy would function as normal if there were no government controls on business and social life. Most of the economic damage has been caused by people voluntarily avoiding their usual activities because of the risk of catching coronavirus, he said, adding: \u201cThere is a region where measures to contain the virus actually help both public health and the economy.\u201d Highlighting a similar decline in consumer spending in Sweden and Denmark this year \u2013 despite fewer restrictions imposed by the Swedish government \u2013 he added: \u201cHigher virus prevalence is associated with weaker economic performance. But tighter government restrictions do not appear to have a clear additional effect on the economy.\u201d Escalating demands on the government to take national action as Greater Manchester falls under the strictest localised restrictions, Dodds claimed that failing to bring the R number below 1 could cost as much as 6% of GDP, equating to \u00a3110bn in lost economic output or \u00a34,000 a household. Labour believes that would dwarf the direct costs of the shutdown. \u201cThe government is in danger of yet again being too slow to act \u2013 and the cost to families across the country could be eye-watering,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cEvery day it delays means more job losses, more shuttered businesses and more livelihoods in ruin. We can\u2019t risk another \u00a3110bn hit to our economy \u2013 we need a national circuit breaker now to fix testing, protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d Experts have suggested that tier 3 base measures \u2013 including the closure of pubs and restaurants \u2013 will not be sufficient. Labour said a two- to three-week circuit breaker could be used to fix the beleaguered test-and-trace system and create breathing-space for the NHS, which risks being overwhelmed in some parts of the country. Starmer said schools should remain open. Downing Street has repeatedly said a nationwide shutdown is not off the table but the prime minister is pursuing a three-tier system of restrictions in the hope of containing the virus regionally. Asked about the possibility of a circuit breaker to coincide with the school half-term holiday in much of England next week, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe believe that the measures that we\u2019ve put in place, which are very targeted and specific, is the right approach.\u201d That contrasts with decisions in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, all of which have imposed fixed-term nationwide restrictions involving the closure of many businesses. Research from the consultancy Capital Economics indicates the extension of tier 3 restrictions to the whole of the UK for two weeks would knock off about 2.5% from Britain\u2019s national output in the month they are applied. If imposed for four weeks, GDP would be cut by about 5%. While saying the cost of inaction was trickier to calculate, Hande Kucuk, deputy director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said a second full lockdown appeared increasingly inevitable. \u201cDoing nothing postpones the GDP costs to a later period, while [it] does not add much to the recovery now as it is already stalling due to higher Covid-19 uncertainty,\u201d she said. She said a circuit breaker would need to be followed by a more advanced test-and-trace system, adding: \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019d be back to pre-circuit break in no time with an abrupt fall in GDP and very weak recovery prospects.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
