Our flights are booked but we need advice on must-see places and safety! We want to see Angel Falls and enjoy some beaches. Julie Greene, Manchester Venezuela is a great idea. It has the beaches you may have missed on the rest of your trip, plus a wide range of things to see and do. Caracas is worth a couple of days to see the colonial centre and enjoy some excellent nightlife. It's also where you most need to be on your guard: theft is the main concern. Keep your valuables close to you. In Caracas, you can arrange a trip to the beautiful beaches of Los Roques, a sparsely-populated archipelago perfect for snorkelling, or not doing very much at all. Take a few days here to unwind. Back on the mainland, Parque Nacional Henri Pittier is a mountainous, verdant area rich in animal and bird life, with lovely small colonial towns close by. An excursion to the Angel Falls is a must. Take a flight to the village of Canaima, then fly on to the falls, or arrange an air tour in nearby Ciudad Bolivar. You'll be there in the dry season but even then the water is a dramatic sight. If you drag yourself away from Los Roques in time, the table mountain of Roraima, deep in the jungle and inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World, is a fantastic multi-day walk and climb. Geoddysey (020 7281 7788) specialises in Venezuela. Snorkelling in Sicily I would like to do some interesting snorkelling and my husband wants to visit Italy. Is there a destination to suit us both, outside the peak summer period? Teresa Marjoram, by email Sicily is a great place to snorkel, and May or June are good months to go. There's a great buzz about Palermo, a fast-changing, historic city. Don't miss its remarkable cathedral, with unique Arab-Norman architecture. The rest of Sicily is equally fascinating - Catania is a bustling, beautiful town - and the island is dotted with well-preserved ancient remains such as those in Syracuse. The crystal-clear waters around the Aeolian Islands provide fine snorkelling. Lipari is easiest to get to, and a number of firms there offer snorkelling excursions. Ryanair flies from Stansted to Palermo. For more on Sicily, visit www.regione.sicilia.it/turismo/. To Russia for love We hope to go to Volgograd in August for the Russian Orthodox Church blessing of our nephew and his Russian bride. The guide books don't show much to visit there once we have seen the remembrance sites for the Battle of Stalingrad. Can you suggestplaces to see? How can we best get there? We are retired so have more time than money, and are happy to use public transport if this is feasible for non-Russian speakers. Carole Atkinson, North Yorkshire The Battle of Stalingrad left almost nothing of the historic centre of what is now Volgograd, so you'll probably focus on the museums and memorial to the devastating conflict that raged from July 1942 to February 1943. All sites related to the battle are chilling and well worth visiting. There are stark ruins preserved near the Afghan War Memorial. The main memorial, at Mamaev Kurgan, just outside the city centre is topped by a 72-metre high statue of Mother Russia. The Volga region's other attractions are far apart. Lenin's birthplace at Ulyanovsk and the port of Astrakhan are both nine hours' journey by train. So why not make this a two-centre holiday, seeing St Petersburg or Moscow, then taking the train to Volgograd. Getting around is straight-forward but you'll feel more confident if arrangements are made in advance. Russian Gateway (07050 803160) can help with flights, hotels and train tickets, as well as giving assistance on visas. Lisbon by rail What is the most convenient way to get to Lisbon by rail in March and April? Cliff Mogg, Basingstoke This journey can be done in around 24 exciting hours. The easiest way is to take a morning Eurostar from Waterloo to Paris, then pop across Paris to catch the TGV from Montparnasse station to Irun, on the French-Spanish border. If you get the timings right, you should be able to squeeze in a quick lunch in Paris. From Irun take the Sud Express, a sleeper that chugs through the Iberian night and delivers you to Lisbon fresh the next morning. Prices depend on when and in what class you travel. Going overland, though, will cost a lot more than by air but it will be fun. Ffestiniog Travel (01766 512400) can arrange tickets. Thomas Cook's European Timetable (\u00a310.50) is 'the bible' for serious rail travellers. \u00b7 We welcome letters. Tom Hall from Lonely Planet addresses as many as possible here.
