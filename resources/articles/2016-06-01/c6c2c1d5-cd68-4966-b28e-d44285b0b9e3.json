Sir Michael Wilshaw, who heads the schools watchdog Ofsted, said it had been a mistake to abolish the externally marked tests for key stage 3 students. As a result, he said, thousands of the most able pupils \u2013 many from disadvantaged backgrounds \u2013 had been left \u201cdrifting\u201d through the first few years of secondary school, allowing academic standards to fall and the attainment gap between rich and poor students to widen. School leaders responded by saying that subjecting schoolchildren to yet more testing was \u201cnot a panacea to every challenge\u201d. The controversial tests were scrapped in 2008 by the then Labour education secretary, Ed Balls, after the company responsible for delivering the papers failed to mark them on time, amid a debate about the value of testing. Wilshaw, who made the comments in his monthly written commentary, pointed out that children in primary school, who are tested at seven and 11, were thriving academically, while children at secondary school who lacked the rigour of formal national testing until 16 were falling behind. \u201cThere can be little doubt, in my view, that these tests have contributed greatly to the recent narrowing of the attainment gap in primary schools between poorer pupils \u2013 including the most able \u2013 and their peers,\u201d he said. He told critics of testing: \u201cThose who indulge in moaning and whinging about national testing need to remember that when standards decline, it is the most disadvantaged pupils who suffer the most.\u201d Wilshaw also proposed the introduction of sanctions against schools that failed to meet their responsibilities towards their most able pupils. He said they should not be allowed to set up an academy trust. \u201cThe most recent statistics paint a bleak picture of underachievement and unfulfilled potential,\u201d said Wilshaw. \u201cThousands of our most able secondary age children are still not doing as well as they should in the non-selective state sector where the vast majority of them are educated.\u201d Last year, 68% of non-selective secondary school pupils who achieved a level 5 or above (which is significantly above average) in English and maths at the end of primary school failed to attain either an A* or A in these subjects at GCSE; 27% failed to achieve the minimum expected progress, a grade B. Wilshaw said: \u201cAs chief inspector, I have consistently lamented the failure of too many secondary schools to stretch our most able children, particularly the poorest. If our nation is serious about improving social mobility then our secondary schools have got to start delivering for these children. \u201cI urge the government to consider bringing back external national testing at key stage 3. I firmly believe that it was a mistake to abolish these tests in the first place. If we are serious about helping all disadvantaged children, but especially the most able, to learn well and unlock their full potential, we need to know how they are doing at 14, as well as at seven, 11 and 16.\u201d Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the amount of formal testing children in England faced was \u201conerous\u201d and the accountability system \u201cfearsome\u201d. \u201cSchools work very hard to provide the best possible education to all their pupils, including the brightest. Most are judged by Ofsted as outstanding or good. Nobody denies there are still challenges but we believe these will best be solved by everybody in the education system working together in a supportive and positive manner.\u201d Labour\u2019s education spokeswoman, Lucy Powell, added: \u201cThe government is incapable of answering Sir Michael\u2019s challenge because they\u2019ve run out of ideas for raising aspiration and stretch in education, and instead continue to focus on unnecessary structural changes which will do nothing to address these important issues.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson acknowledged more needed to be done to ensure the most able children fulfilled their potential, adding that new GCSEs, which were due to be examined for the first time next year, would stretch the brightest pupils. \u201cHowever we are not complacent, and that is why our recent white paper goes even further by committing to investigating and funding approaches to help even more bright children fulfil their vast potential.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
