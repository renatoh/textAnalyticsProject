Dog food. Charlie\u2019s owner, Helena, had stockpiled it, along with some food for herself. Back then, Helena (who doesn\u2019t want her surname published) told me: \u201cI don\u2019t really trust the government to look after me; I certainly don\u2019t trust them to look after my dog.\u201d She had a store of three months\u2019 food for herself, and a year\u2019s worth for Charlie, as an insurance policy in case of shortages after 29 March, the original date on which the UK was supposed to leave the EU. She had been meticulous about it, creating a spreadsheet, colour-coded according to what had been purchased (loo paper, tinned tomatoes), was awaiting delivery (powdered coconut) or was pending testing (dried falafel mix). It was not just food, but booze, dog treats and toys, and even makeup. I remember thinking of the band playing on the Titanic: look good and party on, as the good ship Britannia goes down. Today, Helena is talking to me from her car, on the M4. (Don\u2019t worry: hands-free, she says.) Since January, there have been a few changes in her life. She was made redundant from the charity for which she worked. \u201cSo, I decided to start a handmade ice-cream business, which was absolutely bonkers in the context of Brexit, because it\u2019s a risk in terms of things like consumer confidence and supply issues.\u201d She has tried to make it \u201cBrexit-proof\u201d by keeping overheads low, not having premises and importing as little as possible. She trades from a traditional ice-cream bicycle at farmers\u2019 markets. Popular flavours include peanut butter and caramel, and tiramisu. \u201cAnd, if the worst happens, I can mothball the business for a bit,\u201d she says. What about all her stockpiled stuff? The spreadsheet was completed, with everything bought and stored by 29 March. And the stockpile has remained intact \u2013 mostly \u2013 as subsequent Brexit deadlines have come and gone. Although the supermarket shelves haven\u2019t been emptied yet, she still thinks her stockpiling was worthwhile. \u201cIt\u2019s provided a level of resilience. I don\u2019t have to worry quite as much as I would otherwise. I know I\u2019ve always got something in the cupboard: no matter what happens, I can eat. It\u2019s been helpful even though Brexit hasn\u2019t happened. How is she feeling about that? \u201cThere have been so many twists and turns of the tale of Brexit that it\u2019s not possible to predict what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s come to a point where you can only be stressed for so long about something. I\u2019ve taken a step back from that anxiety because it\u2019s not good for you in the end.\u201d There is one area where she hasn\u2019t been quite so diligent in keeping stocks topped up. \u201cCharlie\u2019s supply has run down a bit, to be honest, just because I\u2019ve been a bit skint. I do still have enough for three months.\u201d I may be imagining it, but I think she lowers her voice when she says this. Charlie is asleep in the back of the car. Another so called prepper I spoke to in January, Jo Elgarf, is desperately worried about the election, about a Conservative majority, and about the possibility of being in a no-deal situation in 2020. Elgarf had stockpiled a few things; the kitchen cupboards were full of pasta, rice and milk powder. That is still there. But food is not Jo\u2019s big worry. Her daughter Nora has a brain condition called polymicrogyria. She takes lots of medication, but without two of them \u2013 Epilim and Keppra \u2013 she would have multiple seizures daily, which could be life-threatening. This isn\u2019t playing politics, it\u2019s about her daughter\u2019s life. Both are controlled medications imported from Europe, and she cannot stockpile them. She was worried when Theresa May was in charge, but did not think we would leave without a deal. She is a lot more worried about Johnson. \u201cAnything could happen if Boris wins,\u201d she says, on the phone from her home in London. \u201cIf they don\u2019t get their way, they could just leave. They\u2019re not going to consider the very vulnerable. They\u2019re not going to go: \u2018Oh, hang on, if we do that, what happens to Nora?\u2019\u201d Since I visited, she has had no reassurance \u2013 from doctors, pharmacists or government \u2013 that there will be a supply of Nora\u2019s meds whatever happens. \u201cNobody knows if they\u2019ve done enough work to stop any problems. How is even a mild version of Yellowhammer going to impact on Nora?\u201d She would like everyone to be able to sit down and read the Operation Yellowhammer report into the potential disruption of a no-deal Brexit, before heading to the polling station. \u201cMy attitude is there\u2019s no point sitting at home moaning,\u201d she says. \u201cI might as well do something.\u201d So she has been out campaigning, for the Lib Dems."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
