She posted footage of the incident to her Instagram and Twitter feeds, which shows the man grabbing at her hair, then pulling her towards him by wrapping his arm around her neck, and kissing her head. Clearly rattled, she breaks free and moves quickly away. Captioning the footage, Cyrus wrote: \u201cShe can be wearing what she wants. She can be a virgin. She can be sleeping with 5 different people. She can be with her husband. She can be with her girlfriend. She can be naked. She CAN\u2019T be grabbed without her consent. #DontFuckWithMyFreedom.\u201d She reposted critical comments made to her on social media following the incident, including \u201cYou wanted to be \u2018sexy\u2019, what do you expect?\u201d, along with the hashtag #stillnotaskingforit. Cyrus has also thrown her support behind abortion rights, announcing a charity fashion project involving her, designer Marc Jacobs, LGBT and homelessness charity Happy Hippie foundation, and US sexual healthcare organisation Planned Parenthood. The singer launched the initiative by posting an image of herself eating a cake featuring the words \u201cAbortion is healthcare\u201d, though was accused of plagiarism by Becca Rea-Holloway, AKA The Sweet Feminist, who had created an identical cake in May 2018. Rea-Holloway described it as \u201cdirect theft of my own original art\u201d. Cyrus apologised, saying: \u201cWe saw the image online and didn\u2019t realise it was yours. We will absolutely tag you for your work.\u201d Cyrus released her new EP, She Is Coming, last week, and stars in the latest episode of the Netflix series Black Mirror, which launches today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
