It showed the word \u201cjustice\u201d written on a piece of paper held up by a disembodied hand. With a lighter, the other hand was setting fire to it. \u201cWrite down \u2018justice\u2019 on a bit of paper. And then burn its corners,\u201d the tag read. Within a day it had vanished, painted over by a municipality cleaning team. For the Istanbul street artist who goes by the name of Pepe, work is a constant game of cat-and-mouse with authorities seeking to remove his political creations. \u201cI drew that when the AKP (Turkey\u2019s ruling Justice and Development party) cancelled the Istanbul election,\u201d he said, sitting at a bar on Friday, two days before the city goes back to the polls in a controversial rerun today. \u201cWe have a right to free and fair information that Turkish media suppresses these days. They do a good job of shutting down the opposition. But they\u2019ll never completely manage it.\u201d That cat-and-mouse struggle, writ large, has been playing out across Istanbul this weekend as the AKP seeks to undo the mayoral victory of opposition coalition candidate Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu. In the March election the previously unknown figure delivered one of the biggest challenges to President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s grip on Turkey in years. Although the governing AKP and nationalist party coalition secured more than 50% of the vote across the country in the 31 March polls, voters delivered an unexpected slap to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s party in four major cities, widely viewed as a rebuke for his handling of Turkey\u2019s burgeoning financial crisis. Istanbul, governed by the AKP and its Islamist party predecessors for 25 years, was the most painful loss. The city constitutes one third of the entire Turkish economy and is the main driver of the AKP\u2019s patronage networks. The president, who began his political career here as mayor in the 1990s and often talks about his deep love for his hometown, also viewed it as a personal rejection. While critics say Erdo\u011fan\u2019s expanded presidential powers are helping erode Turkey\u2019s democratic structures, in March voter turnout \u2013 traditionally high across the country \u2013 still stood at 84%. On election night many Istanbullus who had dejectedly shown up at polling stations to carry out their democratic duty earlier in the day watched the live results at first with curiosity, and then excitement. When the live stream of results from the government news agency stopped at about 9pm, people across the country realised \u0130mamo\u011flu, the People\u2019s Republican party (CHP) candidate, was pulling ahead of his AKP rival, powerful and well-funded former prime minister Binali Yildirim. Initial results gave \u0130mamo\u011flu a razor-thin lead of 0.28% with 99.8% of ballots counted, but the city was forced to endure more than two weeks of waiting for recounts demanded by the AKP before \u0130mamo\u011flu was finally given an official mandate to start work at city hall. Rerunning elections and removing elected officials from their posts have become routine in the 16 years since the AKP came to office. But even by Turkish standards, this race is different. It eventually dawned on the president that conceding Istanbul would accelerate the already shifting dynamics within his party and threaten his position. As Erdo\u011fan famously once said: \u201cWhoever loses Istanbul, loses Turkey.\u201d \u201cThe stakes are very high,\u201d said Sinem Adar, a researcher at Berlin\u2019s Humboldt University. \u201cLess obvious, [than the AKP\u2019s financial considerations] but perhaps the more important implication of the rerun is for the post-election power configuration between Erdo\u011fan and his allies. Cracks within the party that have also become quite visible since [the elections] are further contributing to weakening his grasp of power.\u201d Five weeks after the election, Turkey\u2019s electoral board upheld one of the dozens of complaints made by the AKP and declared the race for mayor of Istanbul must be rerun, triggering an outcry from opposition parties and even from members of the AKP itself, who worried the rerun would dent the party\u2019s democratic credentials. The decision has, curiously, turned \u0130mamo\u011flu into both victor and victim, now fighting on a platform of saving Turkish democracy. The softly spoken 49-year-old has become a household name across Turkey, welcomed as a breath of political fresh air and touted as a possible presidential candidate in 2023. In inclusive, conciliatory speeches \u2013 the opposite of those of the firebrand politicians who have come to dominate Turkey\u2019s polarised political scene \u2013 \u0130mamo\u011flu talked about the need for the city to come together to overcome problems with unemployment and the rising cost of living. He won hearts and minds in pious and working-class AKP neighbourhoods all over the city by showing up to meetings and reaching out both by knocking on doors and through social media across Istanbul\u2019s ethnic, political and religious divides. Yildirim, in contrast, was almost completely sidelined by the president himself, who held huge rallies where he framed the local elections as a matter of \u201cnational survival\u201d and accused opposition parties of links to terrorism. Despite almost blanket pro-AKP media coverage, \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s campaign cut through, reinvigorating a beleaguered and poorly organised CHP unable to field candidates with broad cross-party appeal in the past. In an interview shortly after he entered city hall, \u0130mamo\u011flu told the Observer he was unperturbed by the prospect of an electoral rerun. \u201cI am not feeling any pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 16 million people in this city waiting for me to serve them and do the job I was elected to do.\u201d But tensions across the city have been steadily building ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote. Many in Istanbul were keen to show their support after the election results were cancelled on 6 May. After a child shouted \u201cHer \u015fey \u00e7ok g\u00fczel olacak\u201d \u2013 \u201cEverything will be alright\u201d \u2013 at \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s tour bus, the slogan became the new rallying cry for the level-headed candidate, chanted in bars and at football matches and shared millions of times as a hashtag on social media. Pepe, the graffiti artist, made it the basis of one of his latest pieces. The AKP has learned from \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s success, copying some of the CHP candidate\u2019s ideas, such as subsidised public transport and making an effort to reach young people, conservative-leaning Kurdish voters and AKP supporters who did not vote last time. The president has largely been absent. \u201cI have every faith Binali [Yildirim] will win,\u201d said Melike, 38, a municipality worker, shopping with her teenage children as pro-AKP songs blared from a party stand in Taksim Square. \u201cLast time people wanted to punish the government for their failings, I understand that. But they must know what is at risk now. The party has heard their message very clearly and knows it must deliver now.\u201d Despite the best efforts of Yildirim\u2019s team, according to more reliable polls, two days ahead of the rerun \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s lead widened to about 8-9% \u2013 meaning the AKP is facing the humiliating prospect of losing again. In the past few days, the usually solid AKP election platform has wobbled. Erdo\u011fan has lashed out at \u0130mamo\u011flu, hinting he is in league with the outlawed Kurdish People\u2019s Workers party (PKK), and a bizarre last-minute tactic \u2013 a message from jailed Kurdish PKK leader Abdullah \u00d6calan urging potential swing-voter Kurds not to vote for the CHP \u2013 backfired after Kurdish political parties reiterated their support for \u0130mamo\u011flu. \u201cConservative Kurds, people who used to vote for the AKP, have woken up,\u201d said Hassan Kaplan, 27, one of Istanbul\u2019s estimated 4 million Kurds. \u201cI\u2019m scared there is too much expectation on \u0130mamo\u011flu, but he\u2019s the only person who has given us hope in a while.\u201d Neither AKP nor CHP supporters know what to expect when Sunday\u2019s results come in or what course of action the president might take if faced with another unsatisfactory result. Street protests are rare in Istanbul these days, quickly broken up by police \u2013 but any fresh attempt to overturn a second \u0130mamo\u011flu victory could trigger unrest in new and unexpected parts of the city. Everyone in Istanbul knows what happens in the vote will have profound implications for the city and the country. On a wall in the shopping district of Osmanbey, the faces of Pepe\u2019s \u201cHer \u015fey \u00e7ok g\u00fczel olacak\u201d mural smile at passers-by. For now, at least, it has not been taken down. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they do,\u201d Pepe said. \u201cThe city is fired up. Even if they steal the election again, the cracks in their armour are there. We know that now.\u201d Additional reporting: Gokce Saracoglu"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
