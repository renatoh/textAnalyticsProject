I believe Dell charges \u00a399 to install operating and application software, which, with VAT and delivery, results in a price in excess of \u00a3600. Surely a less powerful machine can be offered to first-time PC users at a cost significantly less than \u00a3500? Many of us use slower PCs and these \"ancient\" models are adequate for web and home use. Marketeers wish to keep prices as close to a grand as possible. Technical gains produce a more powerful model without producing the replaced model at a lower cost. The spiral of increasing capacity and speed that is often in excess of need and demand has to level off. John Flowers john2flowers@aol.com Date dilemma Jenny Madden (Feedback, August 29) claims \"scores\" of women have contacted her after online dating disasters. Many more people of both genders have dating disasters after meeting in traditional ways. At least with the internet, a woman (or man) can assess potential partners without risking physical contact or revealing an address. Could she be blaming a life problem on the internet without recognising its advantages? Jeremy Smith jpwsmith@ntlworld.com Spam plan Here's my idea for beating the spammers (Feedback, August 29). Using the same method used to \"bounce\" emails that are sent to an invalid address, a semi-bounce routine should be automatically sent out on all incoming email. If that transmission bounces back to the server that received the email, indicating that the message had forged headers or if the sender has purposely tried to conceal origin, the email goes no further and is deleted. Spammers would then have to deal with the same volume of messages they force upon others, or in the case of forged headers, the ISPs that allow them to operate. Timmie Forsyth perfectionpaint@hotmail.com Killing apps Re Dave Hills' reminder (Feedback, August 29) that \"services and applications sell, technologies do not\". The computing industry lives by innovating and selling technology and its applications. It is telecoms that understand creating and selling services. Unfortunately, telecoms let computing make the running in the 1980s; we are all obsessed with selling technology, with even computing applications taking a back seat. Few new communications services have surfaced in the past 10 years. The overwhelming need now is to exploit broadband to get growth going again following the dotcom and other disasters. We need to create new broadband communications services that will be used by millions. The people in a position to do this are the countrywide telecoms carriers such as BT. They owe it to us to show what they can do. John Harper berry@pavilion.co.uk Cup of chaos I'm curious to know how Starbucks (Slurp and Surf, August 29) intends to approach the security of its wireless Lan. It would have been appropriate to explain the security concerns surrounding this technology. Emma Batchelor emmabatchelor@yahoo.com Mac mess Re Stephen Wolff's letter (Feedback, August 29), I also have minor problems with Logic/iMac (OS 9.1)/Midiman systems. Do others in the music biz have similar problems? Main difficulties are: USB not recognised at startup and the loss of the MIDI click. Robbie Mitchell robbiemitch@mac.com Bounced out Re Spam Defense (Feedback, August 29). Fake email addresses may be a good idea in some circumstances but a recent recruitment ad we placed in the Guardian produced two applicants with great CVs who \"faked\" their return address. The unlucky applicants will never know whether or not they were considered for the job.
