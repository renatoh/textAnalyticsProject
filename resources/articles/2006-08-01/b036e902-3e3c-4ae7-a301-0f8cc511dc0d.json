While the Israeli response has been a monumental mistake that has plunged the Middle East back into the mire of the 1980s, an exchange of prisoners would have set a dangerous and irreversible precedent. Any submission to terrorist demands would only embolden groups such as Hizbullah to continually test Israel. Mr Monbiot's argument, that Israel never considered a prisoner swap because it was intent on using the situation as a precursor to a planned invasion, fails to acknowledge that that course of action would be considered unfeasible by any government. Westleigh Jones Stoke-on-Trent Staffordshire The main justification for Israel's military offensives is always argued in terms of concern for its territorial security. In March 2002 the Arab governments, led by Saudi Arabia and including the Palestinian Authority, unanimously agreed to accept the state of Israel as defined by the internationally authorised 1967 borders. This offer was rejected by Israel and cast aside by President Bush because of the problem of terrorism. But this terrorism, whether from Hamas or Hizbullah, would have been radically undermined if the Beirut settlement had been accepted. What I cannot understand is why the west chose to ignore this remarkable - and now forgotten - offer, which would have guaranteed the legal borders of Israel, established a firm basis for its future security and offered the best hope for peace in the whole region. Michael Forbes Young London I'm sure public opinion, aghast at the government's failure to back calls for a ceasefire, will respond to the appeals for aid. Yet the question begging to be asked is why charities, the Red Cross and UN relief workers should be expected, at great risk, to provide this desperately needed help to mop up the destruction wrought by Israel. This suffering is not caused by tsunami or earthquake, but preventable cruelty. And while we donate to the devastated people of Lebanon and Gaza, no doubt lucrative rebuilding contracts will soon be handed out to Halliburton and co.
