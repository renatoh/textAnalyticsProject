The Jersey-based company, advised by convicted pension plunderer Gerald Smith, is already the subject of one SFO investigation after \u00a330 million belonging to dotcom firm Izodia, in which Orb owns a 29 per cent stake, disappeared. The money is believed to have been transferred to an Orb subsidiary and Izodia has commenced legal action to recover the cash. SFO officials visited Poole earlier this year to question local people about Orb's plans to regenerate the harbourside, which will feature a new residential complex, shops and bars. The development is the brainchild of Quays Group, a subsidiary of Orb, whose parent company, Orb Securities, is based in the British Virgin Islands. Under the deal struck with Poole Council, Orb was supposed to have contributed \u00a3457,000 to a park and ride scheme to help cut traffic flows to the harbourside. An invoice for the contribution was sent to Orb on 20 November 2002, but no payment has been received. Interest accruing means Orb owes \u00a3500,000. Poole Developments had until last Friday to pay or face legal action. Orb also owes Morgan Stanley more than \u00a317m and the trustees of another bank account more than \u00a310m. The company is trying to sell its portfolio of 37 Thistle hotels and may use the cash to pay creditors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
