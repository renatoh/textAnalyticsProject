Under the plans, further capacity will be released for the BBC to launch channels or experiment with high-definition broadcasts. But they disappointed those in the Welsh valleys and Scottish Highlands who hoped the conversion to digital television between 2008 and 2012 would mean an end to fuzzy analogue television pictures. In a move described by Jim Egan, head of strategy development, as \"the last big regulatory decision underpinning digital switchover\", Ofcom said the new digital transmitter network should have the same coverage - 98.5% of British households - as the existing analogue one. Its final action plan, published yesterday, plumped for the most expensive of five options that it investigated but the one that will guarantee the widest coverage using the existing transmitter network. Under the plan the power of the digital signal will be boosted during the switchover process, slated to begin in the Scottish Borders in 2008 and proceeding on a region-by-region basis until it reaches the south-east in 2012. By boosting the power of the signal, it will enable the BBC to change its transmission mode and squeeze more space out of the existing spectrum. The extra capacity, equivalent to four to six television channels, could be used by the corporation to experiment with high-definition broadcasts, launch local television services or add interactive elements to its radio broadcasts. Any new service will have to be ratified by Ofcom. Some MPs and consumer groups had campaigned for digital terrestrial coverage to be extended to the estimated 375,000 households, mainly in rural areas, that do not receive a satisfactory analogue signal. But Ofcom found that expanding the digital network would have meant installing at least 2,000 extra transmitters as well as converting 1,154 existing ones, making it impossible both physically and financially. The regulator insisted that it remained \"concerned with the interests of the 1.5% of households which are not served by the analogue television services\". Allan Williams, of Which?, said: \"Switchover will not benefit consumers unless everyone can get digital TV. This decision means that some homes may lose TV reception when digital switchover takes place, and falls far short of the government's 99.5% target for digital reception, set in 1999. Ofcom must make sure that alternative means of reception are in place so no one loses out.\" Ofcom said yesterday it would carry out further research into how these households received their signal and what options would be available to them post-switchover. It is predicted many of these households, in areas such as the Welsh valleys and Scottish Highlands and islands, have already converted to digital satellite television or invested in large aerials to combat adverse picture quality. But equally, there will be some viewers who are getting by with a sub-standard signal whose screens will in effect go blank post-switchover. While the government has yet to confirm 2012 as the final switch-off date, prior to the election it committed to switching to digital between 2008 and 2012 in its manifesto. Last year, Ofcom unveiled a detailed region-by-region timetable for the conversion to digital. The BBC is expected to be charged with funding and promoting the change, including converting the transmitter network and possibly subsidising those who cannot afford to convert, in return for a favourable licence fee settlement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
