Last winter everyone was packing their designer smalls for the Indian Ocean, but this season sees the Caribbean fighting back with a clutch of new more-gorgeous-than-ever hotels, wickedly indulgent spas and some of the world's most luxurious villas. Shame about Concorde, but great news that British Airways is about to introduce flat beds (more comfy anyway) in business to Barbados and to other islands later next year. Prices in this report are per person, room only, including flights and transfers, for one week in January next year, followed by one week in May, unless otherwise stated. Villa prices are per person, excluding meals, but including flights, unless otherwise stated. Full-on glamour 1. Once a decade a hotel comes along and reinvents a destination. Hottest news of the year is the opening later this month, on a dreamy white sand crescent beach, of Carlisle Bay, Antigua, destined to lift the island from tired old dowager to supermodel status. Owned by London hotelier Gordon Campbell Gray, of One Aldwych fame, it promises to be the ultimate swag-free zone. The blurb says no dress code, but don't pack a chain-store cossie. Think urban cool, with all the designer hotel essentials - spa, Asian restaurant, state-of-the-art gym, Zen-like suites (never call them rooms), plus a first for the Caribbean - its own cinema; \u00a32,805/\u00a32,140, Elegant Resorts (01244 897999). 2. If Patsy and Edina went to the Caribbean it would have to be St Barts, the tiny French island where even beach bars sell a dozen types of champagne, and it would have to be the Carl Gustaf, just 14 suites, all with private plunge pools and harbour views of the capital Gustavia, a magnet for hunky yachties. You need wheels to get to the beach, but it's a slingback's throw from designer shopping. The hotel owns two white leather upholstered motor yachts so you can avoid the paparazzi and sneak off with a lobster picnic. Regulars include Cindy Crawford, Billy Joel and Demi Moore; \u00a33,615/\u00a32,795, Caribbean Expressions (020 7431 2131). 3. Barbados' grande dame hotel Sandy Lane is now 'so last year' on an island which operates by catwalk rules. Big question this season is will A-list 'oldies' and regulars Caine, Winner, Monkhouse, Cilla and Cliff abandon their glitzy west-coast watering hole to move over to The Crane in the east, the first hotel on the island 125 years ago, now celebrating its renaissance with a major makeover. Most private residences (they don't call them rooms either) have their own pool, mahogany four-poster and whirlpool bath. All overlook a dreamscape pink sand beach, often voted one of the world's best; \u00a31,689/\u00a31,087, Caribtours (020 7751 0660). 4. Company presidents, world leaders and movie moguls all seek out the manicured perfection of Four Seasons Hotels, the worldwide five-star chain where fluff, creases and smears are about as likely as a Caribbean snowstorm. The latest opened this month on Great Exuma in the Bahamas, two hours from Miami, and specialises in rest cures for the well-heeled with three pools (two adults-only), spa with chill-out Zen garden, fishing, diving and castaway champagne picnics on deserted islands. The Greg Norman-designed golf course is also expected to be a major draw; \u00a31,880/\u00a31,590, Seasons in Style (0151 342 0505). 5. Latest rumour on the tiny Spice Island of Grenada is that Mick Jagger and his mate Dave Stewart want to build a hotel. The locals are so laid back that they may not notice. New this season, Bel Air Plantation - 24 cottages painted in Caribbean brights with fretwork verandas, overlooking St David's Harbour - is the latest in barefoot chic. Regular visitors to the island include Oprah Winfrey, Jerry Hall, Frank Skinner and Bill Gates, who arrives by yacht. Expect to catch them in the new Gary Rhodes restaurant at the Calabash Hotel, where he's chasing a Michelin star; \u00a31,749/ \u00a31,554, Harlequin Worldwide (01708 850300). Spa fabulous 6. Jamaica Inn, Ocho Rios, an evergreen favourite with British guests, celebrated its fiftieth anniversary with a new spa, built in a sublime secluded spot on a rocky bluff. Let spa director Carolyn Jobson work on those knotty muscles while you drift off to the sound of the waves. Her CV includes work for Twentieth Century Fox and Disney, so forget the whale music and get her low-down on Hollywood. Celebrities who have benefited from her healing hands include Nicole Kidman, Celine Dion, Don Johnson and Jack Nicholson; \u00a31,659/\u00a31,064, Caribtours (see above). 7. Cap Juluca, more pamper-dome than hotel, on the island of Anguilla with its powder soft beaches has a reputation as a healing zone to the mega-stressed. It's the kind of place where you could see absolutely anyone, from Liam Neeson to Charlie Dimmock, Jimmy Connors, or Claudia Schiffer. This season it takes spa treatments to a new level with a Mind, Body and Spirit programme to include yoga and astrology, as well as consultations with both a past-life therapist and shamanic healer; \u00a32,660/\u00a31,420, excluding treatments and therapies, Seasons in Style (see above). 8. Imagine spending your life dodging the paparazzi. For people like Barbra Streisand, Bruce Willis and Macca and Heather it's a daily occurrence. That's why they keep coming back to Parrot Cay in the Turks &amp; Caicos islands, just south of the Bahamas, and so remote that the snappers don't have a clue how to get there. As well as miles of virgin white sand, it's known for the Shambala Spa, perched on a remote hillside with boggling Caribbean blue views, plus a vast menu of body treatments, therapies, healing sessions and activities, including yoga and martial arts; \u00a32,211/\u00a31,879, B&amp;B, ITC Classics (01244 355527). 9. Ocean Club, Paradise Island, Bahamas has been one of the Caribbean's most elegant addresses since the 1940s when guests such as Zsa Zsa Gabor, Frank Sinatra and Randolph Hearst came by seaplane. Today it's been made even more gorgeous with the addition of one of the world's most indulgent spas. Its focus is on high-end pampering with soothing oils, local fruits and spices. After being massaged speechless they run you a petal-strewn bath. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, your personal butler (every suite has one) arrives with strawberries and champagne, \u00a32,551/\u00a32,451, Carrier (01625 547020). Decadent house parties 10. Mustique has been synonymous with celebrity homes since Princess Margaret used it as her retreat. This winter there are a further 55 villas to let on the island, including the Japanese tea house-inspired property where Mick and Jerry used to spend family holidays. When it comes to design, anything goes. Choose from Carissa, cool, minimalist and all-white; Toucan Hill, bursting with colour and Moroccan treasures from the kasbah, or Yemenja, a circular masterpiece perched on a hilltop, with idiosyncratic stone boulders and water feature. Most sleep 8-10 andcome fully staffed; \u00a320,000-\u00a330,000 for one week, excluding flights, Exotic Chapters (0845 0700 618). 11. What better way to spend a windfall than on your family and friends? Fly a party of 20 on a privately chartered Airbus 319 to Barbados (so much cooler than Concorde) for a week at Cove Springs, a colonial coral stone beach-front mansion with a perfect terrace for cocktails. It comes with six staff, a pool with adjoining whirlpool, well-equipped gym and screening room with a library of 200 DVDs, seating 20. The most stressed you'll get is booking a manicure and telling the cook what you all want for dinner; \u00a38,960/\u00a38,530, Azure Collection (01244 322770). 12. Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes loved Anguilla so much that they decided to get married then and there in a private villa. You don't need to go that far, but for the ultimate in luxury and design it has to be Altamer, recently featured in style bible Architectural Digest. Best described as a mini-Sydney Opera House it sleeps 10, with 10 staff, in Hollywood-style luxury with marble bathrooms, rooftop hot tub, games room, a bar on every floor and flat- screen TVs. It's also probably the only villa in the Caribbean with a lift. A similar second villa, this time with a resident pianist (honest) opens this month, a third next year; \u00a33,426/ \u00a32,654, ITC Classics (as above). 13. The smaller islands have a head start when it comes to privacy, which is probably why both Prince Andrew and Bill Wyman (not at the same time) recently chose Peter Island, a tiny emerald dot in the British Virgin Islands chain. This season sees the opening of Falcon's Nest and Raven's Nest, two new hilltop properties for 12, promising 'luxury of the highest level'. You could probably walk, but a jeep is thoughtfully provided so you don't have to schlep back up the hill after a treatment in the beachside spa. The Salt Island scrub, using locally farmed sea salt, is the best ever tan starter; \u00a35,636/ \u00a34,229, full board, Caribtours (as above)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
