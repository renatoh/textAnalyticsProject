According to mortgage brokers Savills Private Finance, in the past 10 days Portman Building Society has raised its five-year fix from 4.45 to 4.59 per cent, Northern Rock placed its fixed-rate range on withdrawal notice (meaning it can pull them at short notice) and Abbey withdrew its fixed rate mortgage deals and replaced them at rates of 0.1-0.15 per cent higher. Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester also put its two-year fix on withdrawal notice, while Newcastle withdrew its two-year 4.22 per cent fixed deal. 'This isn't good news for those who need the certainty of set monthly mortgage repayments, so if you are in that position you would be wise to fix sooner rather than later,' said Melanie Bien, associate director at Savills Private Finance. Care home guide People entering care homes should be given written contracts covering the terms and conditions of their relationship with the managers, following a commitment made last week by the national care home regulators. A free Observer and Guardian guide to finding and funding a care home is available on 0800 694 7007 from the guide sponsor, NHFA. It covers contracts and what to look out for in them. Work pension assistance Thousands of people who face a shortfall from their occupational pension because their scheme was under-funded when it wound up will be able to apply for compensation from 1 September. The Financial Assistance Scheme was set up as part of the Pensions Act 2004 by the government, which is committing \u00a3400 million over 20 years. Members of at least 380 schemes who were with their company pension provider between January 1997 and April this year and their employer became insolvent could be eligible for compensation. 'We will be trying to get priority payments to those who are terminally ill or have already reached retirement age,' said a spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions. It said that those within three years of their scheme's normal retirement age, or above, on 14 May 2004 will have their pensions topped up to a level broadly equivalent to 80 per cent of their core expected pension. The department will be publishing contact details and information about claiming on 1 September, but you can register to receive updates at www.dwp.gov.uk/fas.
