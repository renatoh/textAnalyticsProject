More than 80,000 passengers were stranded as flights were grounded due to the unofficial strike of the check-in and customer services staff. At Terminal One, passengers of cancelled flights waited in queues leading nowhere. Frustrated and angry, and sometimes in tears, passengers sat on their luggage with their heads in their hands. Iain Pringle spent six hours standing in a queue with his wife Elaine and two children Sarah, 7, and Iain, 9. He said: 'They didn't tell us anything, they just asked us to get off the flight and pick up our luggage. To get home to Glasgow by another route is going to cost us \u00a3600.' They were exhausted, having just arrived back from Australia. Staff walked out in protest against an automated time card system, obliging them to clock in and out of work electronically. BA insists the idea is simply to replace a paper-based method and said the new system was widespread across British industry. But employees fear it would lead to their being sent home during quiet periods and then having to make up the time during busier days. BA described this as 'absolute nonsense', but anger grew when staff were told the new system was to be implemented this week. The spontaneous walk-out of 250 check-in staff took even union officials by surprise. Terminal Four was soon in the same chaos as Terminal One, as all long-haul flights were cancelled until 6pm last night and all short-haul flights were abandoned for the rest of the day. No one could give any indication of how long it would take to resume normal services. Travellers whose flights were cancelled were asked by BA to leave the airport, but police and security staff told them to stay where they were. This was partly because the scale of the exodus was becoming dangerous. Queues wound their way through the corridors up to the Heathrow Express train for London. Only passengers who had checked in and had boarding cards were told that they could be reimbursed for hotel costs. Alex Warrender, 53, a quantity surveyor trying to get on a flight to Edinburgh, said: 'There's nobody at any check-in counters and we cannot hear the Tannoy system. It's a real struggle to get information on the telephone because they don't accept mobile phone numbers.' Trade union representatives were holding emergency talks with BA last night, and trying to encourage staff to return to work. But they said they had warned managers they were making a huge tactical mistake by linking a 3 per cent pay rise to new working practices. 'These are not militant workers but they have just had enough,' one union official said. He said the unions had co-operated with thousands of job cuts following the downturn in air travel in the wake of 11 September. 'They boxed themselves in with this crazy idea and they are refusing to back down.' The BA staff want the 3 per cent to be paid immediately, arguing it is months overdue, while negotiations continue on working practices. BA was struggling to cope with thousands of phone calls last night from passengers worried about flights today and over the coming week. A company spokeswoman said: 'We are very sorry for the disruption this is causing our customers.' And she offered them three options: re-book, re-route or refund."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
