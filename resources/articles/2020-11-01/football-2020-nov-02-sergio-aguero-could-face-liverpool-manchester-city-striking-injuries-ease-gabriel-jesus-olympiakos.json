Ag\u00fcero was injured in the draw at West Ham on 24 October. Guardiola\u2019s initial view was that the club\u2019s record goalscorer could be out for up to a month but there is a chance the 32-year-old could face Liverpool in a pivotal early-season fixture. If City beat the champions they will move two points behind Liverpool with a match in hand. Asked about Ag\u00fcero\u2019s prospects the manager said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make a step back again [by rushing him] but he\u2019s getting better. It\u2019s not so [bad] as we believed when he felt something in the last game, against West Ham. He\u2019s getting better \u2013 I don\u2019t know about Liverpool. After the international break for sure he\u2019ll be ready.\u201d Jesus suffered a muscle problem after playing all of City\u2019s season-opening win at Wolves on 21 September, and Guardiola has fielded Raheem Sterling and Ferran Torres as deputy No 9s in the absence of Jesus and Ag\u00fcero. The Brazilian could return for the visit of Olympiakos in City\u2019s third Group C game. \u201cWe\u2019ll see the last training [before the match],\u201d Guardiola said. \u201dHe did one with the team yesterday [Sunday]. We are happy he\u2019s back but we\u2019ve been happy with Ferran so we have an alternative.\u201d Torres has scored in each of City\u2019s previous two Champions League wins, against Porto and Marseille, operating at centre-forward in the latter match. Sterling has played in the position numerous times under Guardiola. The manager has previously said Ag\u00fcero will be close to impossible to replace and was asked on Monday whether Sterling might be a long-term solution. \u201cHe can play there when the opponents are defending a lot of spaces in behind; when teams come to press he can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen teams settle in the box for 90 minutes he\u2019s better down the sides than in the middle.\u201d In the transfer window Nathan Ak\u00e9 and R\u00faben Dias were bought to strengthen City\u2019s centre-back options, with Aymeric Laporte, Eric Garc\u00eda and John Stones already at the club. Guardiola is content with this new depth after Vincent Kompany\u2019s departure in summer 2019 and Laporte\u2019s serious injury blighted his previous campaign. \u201cDefinitely I am pleased,\u201d he said. \u201cWe struggled a lot last season, with the problems we had: Vincent went to Belgium [to Anderlecht] and there was a serious injury for Laporte. We were damaged, but we\u2019ve new players coming and we have alternatives to use in the position.\u201d Guardiola warned against complacency when playing Olympiakos, the Greek champions. \u201cYou cannot make a false step in the Champions League because after that you struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know to qualify you have to secure your games at home and win at least one away. We did it winning in Marseille but now we have to be sure we can keep the points at home. That\u2019s why tomorrow we have an incredible opportunity to make a huge step to qualify for the next round. Olympiakos have to win every game and when you play with this mentality it\u2019s difficult to face.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
