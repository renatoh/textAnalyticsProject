In a blow to prosecutors, Judge Guido Piffer ruled that investigating magistrates in Milan had not provided enough evidence to justify putting the 29 individuals and three financial institutions involved in the collapse of the food group on an accelerated trial. In a 29-page ruling, Judge Piffer said that there was sufficient evidence to order eight of the accused - including Mr Tanzi and two outside auditors - to go immediately to trial, but not enough material to warrant a trial for all defendants now. The judge decided that it would be better not to divide the accused into two groups in different trials because their roles in the case were still unclear. Prosecutors last week requested a fast-track trial for the 29 former Parmalat executives, bankers and auditors, and for the Italian units of Bank of America and auditors Deloitte &amp; Touche and Grant Thornton, now renamed Italaudit. An immediate trial would have skipped preliminary hearings, which could have lasted for several years, with defendants possibly going before a judge as early as April. The charges against the defendants include market-rigging, false auditing and regulatory obstruction. The case has been described as Europe's Enron - a reference to the collapse of the US energy giant. Magistrates have been investigating Parmalat since December after the dairy giant announced that a \u20ac4bn bank deposit did not exist. The company subsequently filed for bankruptcy, sparking one of the world's biggest financial scandals, and prosecutors have said that, for more than a decade, management had conspired to mask billions of euros of losses at the food firm. \"Speed should not come at the expense of accuracy,\" Umberto Mosetti, a partner with shareholder group Deminor, told Reuters. He added that investors were more concerned about civil cases to recover their investments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
