Georgios Samaras, who had his header from Scott Brown's cross ruled out, argued, with a degree of legitimacy, that his effort was good. \"I was onside 100%, I was with the defender and when I made my move, I was definitely onside.\" The assertions of Celtic's manager, Tony Mowbray, that if the goal had stood his team \"would have won 2-1\" were slightly more dubious as there was still half an hour left to play. Worse was to come for Mowbray, with Celtic denied a penalty in stoppage time as Darren Dods handled inside the area. Even Dundee United's manager, Craig Levein, joked: \"He feels he should have held it.\" Levein had his own complaint with the free-kick which led to Scott McDonald heading Celtic's equaliser. Dods was penalised for handball but Levein said: \"I had a great view of it. I watch football on television 24/7 and nowadays that is not a free-kick. If Darren Dods is eight to 10 yards away and puts his hand up to try and stop the ball then I can accept that but he was too close to the ball to have been judged to deliberately handle it. And I've yet to see anybody who can jump to try and block a cross with his hands by their side.\" Dods thought that his later good luck evened things up. \"It hit my head then hit my thumb and bounced away but I think we were unfortunate in the first half,\" he said. \"I had my hands by my side and the referee didn't give it but the linesman did.\" David Goodwillie had lashed United, who join the Old Firm as the unbeaten teams in the Scottish Premier League, in front after just six minutes. The only surprise was that there were no further goals. That would have delighted Rangers, who had earlier dropped two points at Motherwell, and Levein as well. The United manager will be under consideration by the Scottish Football Association if George Burley is sacked as the international manager; given his team's showing here, it is perfectly easy to see why. The visitors lost Scott Robertson to a red card in the dying stages following two bookings, a decision Levein thought justified. \"I can't argue with the sending-off,\" Levein said. \"Scott had three fouls and had been booked, and was booked again. But there was another player who had 10 fouls today \u2013 not from my team, I may add.\" Celtic's attentions now turn to the opening of their Europa League campaign. They may do so against Hapoel Tel Aviv on Thursday without the influential Brown, who is to consult a specialist over an ankle problem.
