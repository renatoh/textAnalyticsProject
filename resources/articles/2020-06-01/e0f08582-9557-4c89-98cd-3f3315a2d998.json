No mention was made of Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback whose decision to kneel during the national anthem during a preseason game in August 2016 kick-started the protest movement. The commissioner\u2019s message came following a week and a half of nationwide protests sparked by the killing of Minneapolis man George Floyd by four police officers. On Thursday, more than a dozen of the NFL\u2019s biggest stars, including Patrick Mahomes, Saquon Barkley, Michael Thomas, Odell Beckham Jr and Deshaun Watson, delivered a passionate message on racial inequality which was retweeted by the league\u2019s official Twitter account on Friday only moments before Goodell\u2019s. Thomas, the New Orleans Saints wide receiver who has led the league in receptions the past two seasons, opens the video with the statement: \u201cIt\u2019s been 10 days since George Floyd was brutally murdered.\u201d The players then take turns asking the question, \u201cWhat if I was George Floyd?\u201d The players then name several of the black men and women who have recently been killed, including Floyd, Arbery, Breonna Taylor and Eric Garner. \u201cI AM George Floyd,\u201d Hopkins says. Adams follows with: \u201cI AM Breonna Taylor.\u201d The video closes with the players insisting they \u201cwill not be silenced.\u201d They also demand the NFL state that it condemns \u201cracism and the systemic oppression of black people. ... We, the National Football League, admit wrong in silencing our players from peacefully protesting. ... We, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
