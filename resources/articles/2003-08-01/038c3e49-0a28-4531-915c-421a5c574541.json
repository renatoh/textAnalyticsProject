The email exchange, between two MoD officials whose names were concealed on September 10 last year, quoted Dr Kelly's concerns about the draft dossier's description of \"growth media\", a reference to cultures in which biological germs can be developed and preserved. \"The existing wording is not wrong, but it has a lot of spin in it,\" Dr Kelly is quoted as saying in the email. But Martin Howard, the MoD's director general of communications at the time the dossier was compiled last year, played down the importance of Dr Kelly's use of the word \"spin\". Mr Howard, who was giving evidence to the Hutton inquiry in his new capacity as the Ministry's deputy director of defence intelligence, said he had spoken to the person who sent the email which included Dr Kelly's view. He added this individual felt the word \"spin\" referred to different interpretations being put on the relevant information in the dossier by intelligence experts, rather than a particular line being imposed by the government. \"I did speak to the individual concerned. What he told me was this was an area where they were trying to account for something that hadn't been found. Where lots of different figures were around, all of them in their different ways correct, and its was in that way he meant use the phrase 'a lot of spin on it',\" Mr Howard said. But he admitted this was the view of the official that sent the email, and not necessarily Dr Kelly's view. Mr Howard said it was \"very probable\" that Dr Kelly's views on the \"spin\" put on growth media information were included in the email following a conversation between the microbiologist and the official concerned. \"It sounds like the individual involved rang him up,\" he added. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
