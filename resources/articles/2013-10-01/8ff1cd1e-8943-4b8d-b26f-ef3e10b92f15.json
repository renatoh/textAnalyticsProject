A survey of senior financial decision-makers found that less than two in five respondents were confident that the independent commission's solutions would be acted upon. The commission, led by the former head of the Financial Services Authority, Sir Howard Davies, is considering whether south-east England needs more runways. A ComRes survey commissioned by the Airport Operators Association (AOA), which questioned 500 business figures, found that 37% of respondents were confident that the commission's recommendations would be implemented, with a similar number expressing the opposite view. The poll was published on Monday, 24 hours before Davies addresses the annual AOA conference in London. At the beginning of this month, in his first comments since being appointed chairman of the commission, Davies said that it may recommend extra runways at more than one location, which could include a new airport in the Thames estuary. Darren Caplan, AOA chief executive, said: \"It is worrying that there are so many doubts from business that the commission's findings will get implemented, at a time when international rivals are growing their ties with the fast-growing economies of the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
