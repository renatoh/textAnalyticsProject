Dedicated to Mary Ann \u201cPolly\u201d Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly, the five \u201ccanonical\u201d victims of Jack the Ripper, The Five sees Rubenhold untangle what she calls the \u201cweb of assumptions, rumour and unfounded speculation\u201d that surrounds the women more than century after their deaths. Rubenhold\u2019s argument \u2013 that there is no evidence that three of the women did sex work, despite the established narrative that the serial killer targeted prostitutes \u2013 has seen her become the target of online abuse, with some \u201cRipperologists\u201d even comparing her to the Holocaust denier David Irving. With so many books focusing on the identity of Jack the Ripper, her intention in writing The Five was not to hunt and name the killer, she says. \u201cI wish instead to retrace the footsteps of five women, to consider their experiences within the context of their era, and to follow their paths through both the gloom and the light. They are worth more to us than the empty human shells we have taken them for \u2026 It is for them that I write this book. I do so in the hope that we may now hear their stories clearly and give back to them that which was so brutally taken away with their lives: their dignity.\u201d Chair of judges and editor of the Times Literary Supplement Stig Abell said that despite the strength of the shortlist \u2013 which included from Casey Cep\u2019s investigation into Harper Lee\u2019s abandoned true-crime book, Furious Hours, and Azadeh Moaveni\u2019s book on the women who joined Islamic State, Guest House for Young Widows \u2013 the panel was clear that The Five should win. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliantly written and it\u2019s brilliantly researched. It\u2019s a great story and it\u2019s a great moral act, reclaiming the voice of these women,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it does speak to our times. I don\u2019t think relevance should ever trump brilliance, but there is already brilliance. And it is so relevant now in terms of how crimes, particularly sex crimes and crimes against women, can be reported and considered and talked about.\u201d Abell said he was particularly struck by the \u201cutter tragedy\u201d of the women\u2019s stories. \u201cThese women \u2026 were trapped the circumstance of their gender and the circumstance of their birth; they were poor, neglected, they never really had a shot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe arc of the tragedy is that you know the ending, you know it\u2019s inevitable, but there are just these moments dotted through where you think, \u2018Maybe if they could stick in that job, get a place, maybe if that relationship works out, if they can ditch the booze, everything will be all right.\u2019 In the end, they are victims not just of this fetishised man, they\u2019re ultimately victims because they were out on the streets, they were poor, they had no shot.\u201d Rubenhold, who lives in London, becomes the seventh woman in 21 years to win the Baillie Gifford prize, which was formerly known as the Samuel Johnson award. She is the author of books including Lady Worsley\u2019s Whim, which was dramatised by the BBC as The Scandalous Lady W, and Covent Garden Ladies, which inspired ITV\u2019s Harlots. The Five has also been optioned for television. Speaking before she knew of her win, Rubenhold said of her subjects: \u201cThese were ordinary people, like you and I, who happened to fall on hard times. There\u2019s so much in their stories that we can take away that tells us about how we live today: everything from homelessness to addiction to domestic violence. And people become victims because society doesn\u2019t care about them.\u201d Abell was joined on the judging panel by TV producer and journalist Dr Myriam Fran\u00e7ois Oxford University professor of English literature Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, critic and biographer Frances Wilson, novelist Petina Gappah, and doctor and TV presenter Dr Xand van Tulleken. The remaining titles shortlisted for the prize were Laura Cumming\u2019s On Chapel Sands, William Feaver\u2019s The Lives of Lucian Freud and Julia Lovell\u2019s Maoism: A Global History, which won the Cundill history prize last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
