Baxter, a former Preston, Stockport and Dundee United defender, has spent the past 20 years abroad, five of them in Sweden coaching Orebro, Halmstad and AIK Stockholm - where he won the title in 1998 - but returned to Britain last year after keeping Lyn in the Norwegian first division. He is now a Football Association coach under Howard Wilkinson but in effect becomes Eriksson's spy as the Swede prepares his adopted side to take on his homeland team in their World Cup opener in Saitama on June 2. \"In conjunction with the work that I'll be doing with the national youth teams under Howard Wilkinson, I also have a brief to compile a dossier on the Sweden team for Sven,\" Baxter said yesterday. \"It's quite an interesting scenario: an Englishman who has worked in Sweden travelling around the world to watch Sweden in order to provide a report for a Swede who is about to take England to the World Cup.\" Baxter, 48 and the son of a former Wolves player, witnessed Sweden's 2-2 draw with Greece in Salonika last month and will also watch their friendlies against Switzerland, Norway, Paraguay and Japan. \"Among others, I have worked with Olof Mellberg, Niclas Alexandersson and Johan Mjallby and they are without doubt top-quality players,\" he said. \"The Swedes have two major strengths: one is their work ethic and loyalty to their team-mates; the other is their organisation, something which few teams in the world do as well.\" Sweden, like England, failed to get through the group stages in Euro 2000 but they had not lost a game in qualifying for that tournament - and nor did they in World Cup qualifying. \"With that experience of Euro 2000 behind them and the same formula and managers in place this time around, there is no way that they will be going to Korea and Japan simply to make up the numbers,\" Baxter said. \"There will probably be more pretenders to the 2002 World Cup than any of the World Cups that have gone before. Sweden are one of those countries that fit into that category.\" Sweden have not lost to England in nine games since going down at Wembley in 1968, drawing 1-1 in last year's friendly at Old Trafford even though they were without three leading players, Patrik Andersson, Fredrik Ljungberg and Henrik Larsson. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
