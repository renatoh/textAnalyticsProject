Multiplex, which has lost more than \u00a3200m on the delayed project, accused Wembley National Stadium Ltd of delaying completion of the project and warned it would be seeking legal redress. Wembley's owners responded by accusing Multiplex of missing crucial deadlines and of making \"deliberately confusing\" statements - but the Football Association said it was confident the \u00a3757m stadium would be ready for next year's Cup final. The acrimonious exchanges and the farcical delays suggest a legal cloud will hang over the project, even after the first match has been successfully completed at the arena. It is almost inevitable that disputes over its construction will end up in a lengthy arbitration process or possibly in court as lawyers wrangle over who was to blame for the protracted fiasco. That process could take anything between six months and two years to resolve. Some believe Multiplex's statement was designed to crank up pressure on WNSL but a company insider denied it was sabre-rattling. Some industry experts believe there is a real possibility the stadium might not be ready next summer bearing in mind its ill-starred history. Multiplex agreed to build Wembley on a fixed price contract of \u00a3450m and has faced penalty charges of \u00a3120,000 a day since January 31, 2006. It is understood the penalties will be capped at \u00a338m although the final sum is likely to be determined in court. Multiplex is understood to be seeking compensation of up to \u00a3150m, arguing that delays were caused by design changes instigated by WNSL. Yesterday's very public mud-slinging appeared to be preliminary skirmishes in that full-scale legal battle. Yesterday construction work was continuing at the stadium, where the turf has been laid and goalposts installed, but disputes remain over who is responsible for carrying out remaining work and the timescale. In a statement issued to the Australian stock exchange, Multiplex said: \"The stadium works are now substantially complete with the exception of the installation of the last remaining seats.\" But it said WNSL had not completed works - such as installation of CCTV cameras, cabling for communications and mobile cash tills - which would delay Multiplex from achieving \"practical completion\" of its contractual obligations. It said WNSL needed to carry out the works before public safety licences could be obtained at a series of test events. Multiplex said it had hired a consultant to assess the state of WNSL's preparedness. \"The analysis has been reviewed with an expert in the operation of major stadia and indicates that it is unlikely that the stadium will be able to hold a test event for 90,000 spectators before June 2007.\" The statement added: \"Multiplex has advised WNSL of its entitlement to extensions of time to October 2007 and of its intention to pursue legal proceedings in that and other respects, including WNSL's acts and omissions which are preventing Multiplex's ability to achieve practical completion.\" Michael Cunnah, WNSL's chief executive, said he had always tried to give a realistic appraisal of progress on site. \"The contract with Multiplex has two critical future milestones which Multiplex has deliberately confused. Multiplex is required to hand WNSL a completed stadium, which is defined in the contract as 'practical completion'. WNSL then has to work with Multiplex to finish certain works and to hold the various test events which will enable the safety certificate to be obtained and achieve 'operational completion', the point at which a fully functioning stadium is delivered, capable of holding full-capacity events for 90,000 people.\" Cunnah said that, despite Multiplex's claim to be substantially complete, the stadium's roof had yet to be finished along with remedial works to the drainage network and installation of 10,000 seats. The most recent date forecast for practical completion was in September but Cunnah said: \"We note their latest statement does not actually give a new date or confirm the previous September date ... in the absence of a detailed programme of work from the contractor that we can rely on, we estimate that Multiplex will finish their work at some point late this year.\" Once the completed stadium was handed over, WNSL had a detailed timetable of works and test events which should enable operational completion to take place within two to three months of the handover, he said. \"The bottom line for us is that we will be ready two to three months after they give us a finished stadium. If they can achieve that this year, then we will be able to open the stadium in early 2007. We hope that Multiplex will devote all their energies to completing the stadium at the earliest opportunity as is their responsibility.\" Wembley insiders believe Multiplex has lost so much money, it is increasing the pressure on WNSL and sub-contractors in the hope of getting some cash back. \"We're not interested in the blame game,\" a WNSL source said. \"We just want it finished. To say we would do anything to delay it is pretty stupid.\" The FA had to move this year's FA Cup final to Cardiff and two World Cup warm-up matches were switched to Old Trafford. Yesterday it said no contingency plans had been made to book the Millennium Stadium and there is also the possibility of playing an England friendly at the stadium in February. Paul Sergeant, the chief executive of the Millennium Stadium, said he would welcome next year's final back to Cardiff for a seventh time should Wembley not be ready. Stadium faultlines and work still in progress The arch A row between Multiplex and the steel firm Cleveland Bridge over the 133-metre arch caused delays - and the withdrawal of the firm from the site following a dispute over design alterations. Both sides sued each other. In a complex ruling the court found mainly in Multiplex's favour. A switch to new contractors Hollandia cost \u00a330m - and three months. Design changes Multiplex has consistently argued that up to 600 design changes have delayed construction and added to their costs. WNSL insists there is a contractually agreed process to make design changes - and it did not proceed with any that required an extension of the construction timescale. The walkway Multiplex faced a four-month delay in gaining access to the land to build the main pedestrian walkway to the stadium following a dispute between the landowners Quintain Estates and WNSL. Wrong kind of concrete An unsuitable form of concrete was initially used in foundations for the stadium's arch. Subcontractors Problems with subcontractors have blighted the project. Plumbing firm SGD Engineering went into administration last year, while the recent insolvency of the stadium seat subcontractor has delayed the installation of the final 10,000 seats. Industrial disputes There have been a series of walkouts, the first in August 2004 when workers went on strike over the dismissal of 200 men in a dispute over working hours. Builders refused to work overtime over Christmas 2005 after 22 steel contractors were laid off. In March the GMB union claimed 120 steelworkers, scaffolders and welders were laid off because sub-contractors had not been paid. Work outstanding This includes completion of the stadium roof, remedial work to the drainage network, the building management and life safety systems and installation of 10,000 seats. WNSL has recruited 6,200 people but can only train them when the stadium is handed over. It also has to install radio communications systems and national flags. Three \"ramp-up\" events have to be held, involving between 30,000 and 60,000 spectators, before Wembley gets a safety licence for staging 90,000 capacity events.
