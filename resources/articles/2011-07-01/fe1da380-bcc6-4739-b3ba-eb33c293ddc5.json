The New Yorker, who puts his IBF version of the world light-welterweight title on the line against the WBA champion here on Saturday in Las Vegas, did not have far to travel, and offered no excuse for his tardiness. \"It's cool,\" said Khan, who arrived on time for his workout, with Judah still hitting the pads in the ring constructed in the middle of the casino complex to drum up trade for the unification fight. As Khan spoke to reporters standing on the edge of the ring, Judah posed for the cameras behind his back. Both looked in great shape for a fight that, if he wins, will propel Khan in the direction of Floyd Mayweather, who returns to the ring in September after a long absence to fight Victor Ortiz."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
