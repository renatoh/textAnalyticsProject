Hossein Amini\u2019s short, sharp, chic adaptation of Patricia Highsmith\u2019s novel stars Viggo Mortensen and Kirsten Dunst as the wealthy Yank couple touring Greece with a certain duality of purpose in 1962; Oscar Isaac is the silver-tongued tourist scam artist who warily takes them on. In each other, the two conmen grudgingly meet their match, as a hotel room murder initiates a mutually suspicious alliance. Things get more heatedly Highsmithian from there, but Amini keeps a cool grip on this nasty, knotty yarn throughout. The star trio, meanwhile, could hardly be better. Or look better, for that matter, in what is surely the year\u2019s best-dressed film so far: what a shame to smear those creamy linen suits and lemon-chiffon sundresses with blood. Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton\u2019s similarly style-conscious derelicts have no such qualms in Jim Jarmusch\u2019s Only Lovers Left Alive (Soda, 15), but that\u2019s understandable \u2013 they are vampires, even if, swanning louchely about Detroit and Tangiers pontificating airily on contemporary rock music and the impending apocalypse, they\u2019re about as threatening as a pair of Dalston art students. That\u2019s at least partly the point of Jarmusch\u2019s bone-dry comedy, which nonetheless isn\u2019t above the odd cheap and cheerful gag. It\u2019s sort of an elegy for more elegant vampire etiquette, whatever that might have been, and a riposte to the more naive Nosferatu melodrama of the Twilight series. The round-midnight atmosphere of drowsy decadence is seductive for a stretch, though a little goes rather a long way: I missed Mia Wasikowska \u2013 a brief, electrifying mid-film presence as Swinton\u2019s more brashly bloodsucking sister \u2013 when she was gone. Lenny Abrahamson\u2019s vinyl-black comedy Frank (Curzon, 15), gives Michael Fassbender an improbable test of his onscreen magnetism: as a volatile indie band frontman cracking up before he cracks the big time, he has to project tortured brilliance, emotional vulnerability and a not-half-bad Bowie-Reed drawl from within the confines of a crater-sized papier-mache head in the image of Frank Sidebottom. He\u2019s mesmerising, but the film isn\u2019t his alone. It\u2019s the wonderful Domhnall Gleeson who shoulders proceedings as a profoundly untalented northern songwriter who is absorbed into the band by default, and learns some tough life lessons about the chasm between ambition and ability. It\u2019s a film kissed by moving, genuinely inspired strangeness \u2013 a significant leap for Abrahamson from the measured realism of What Richard Did and Garage, but he hasn\u2019t made a bad film yet. I have many learned colleagues who would say the same of Jia Zhangke, that thorniest and most politically potent of contemporary Chinese filmmakers, though I\u2019ve often found his work more imposing than illuminating. While I found his latest, the barbed four-strand allegory A Touch of Sin (Arrow, 15), typically hard to love, it\u2019s among his most needling, ornately layered films. Meshing high melodrama and lurid B-movie gore into a ferocious state-of-the-nation address, it takes no act of violence for granted. A more curious candidate for a devoted auteurist following is Resident Evil director Paul WS Anderson \u2013 likely to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson in name only \u2013 whose gaudy recipe for all-in-one digital action casserole has recently inspired a profusion of post-ironic critical analysis. I don\u2019t get it myself, and Pompeii (eOne, 12), his calculatedly cheesy fusion of Roman sword-and-sandal epic and natural disaster movie (you can guess the disaster), brought me no closer to the light. No critic has made great claims for Swedish director Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, meanwhile, since My Life as a Dog in 1985. Having since graduated to Hollywood with drippy Oscar bait and drippier Nicholas Sparks romances, he returns home to jump on the Scandi crime bandwagon with the Lars Kepler adaptation The Hypnotist (Studiocanal, 15). A psychological thriller that begins with the murder of an entire Stockholm family and scarcely gets cheerier from there, it\u2019s proficient late-night viewing with fierce supporting work from the under-employed Lena Olin. It\u2019s a straight-to-DVD release, as is Greg McLean\u2019s Wolf Creek 2 (eOne, 18), for which I had higher hopes: an eight-years-on sequel to one of the great modern horror films, this slick return to outback slash-and-dash territory delivers the requisite jolts with aplomb, but suffers from a self-aware jokiness that wasn\u2019t present in its steel-cold predecessor. There are more taxing rewards to be gained from the week\u2019s best Netflix addition, the intricately researched, visibly incensed American political documentary Citizen Koch, which weighs in on the rights and (mostly) wrongs of the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling in 2010, and the degree of influence it granted corporations in funding and shaping electoral campaigns and policy. If that description sounds a bit mealy, directors Carl Deal and Tia Lessin know how to assemble an urgent, compelling argument from a fog of informational noise \u2013 the film doesn\u2019t land the gut-punch of their extraordinary post-Katrina film Trouble the Water, but it\u2019s impressive nonetheless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
