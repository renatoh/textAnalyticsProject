John Lyons says he was subjected to consistent pressure from the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC) while based in Jerusalem for the Australian for six years, as were the ABC\u2019s Sophie McNeill and the veteran ABC correspondent Peter Cave. In his Middle East memoir Balcony Over Jerusalem, Lyons says Cave told him another group prepared dossiers on Cave and other ABC reporters \u201cand sent them to like-minded journalists and members of parliament\u201d. Lyons says pressure also came from inside his own paper. He says the former editor of the Weekend Australian Nick Cater refused to publish his work and the pro-Israel lobby bombarded editors with criticism of his reports. \u201cI phoned Cater and he confirmed that he\u2019d asked for my work to no longer appear in Inquirer [the Australian\u2019s Saturday opinion section],\u201d Lyons writes. \u201cI let [editor-in-chief Chris] Mitchell know that, from my point of view, the exclusion from Inquirer was just the latest in a long series of disagreements with Nick Cater \u2026 he intervened and told Cater that excluding me from Inquirer was not acceptable.\u201d Lyons writes that an Israeli embassy official was invited by Cater to the Australian\u2019s head office in Sydney, and told editors that the embassy was not happy with him. \u201cTo me the idea of an officer of a foreign government wandering the floor of my newsroom criticising me was outrageous.\u201d Lyons interviewed Mitchell and others for the book, but Cater declined. In 2015, AIJAC sent a file on McNeill to Jewish members of the ABC board, including the then chairman James Spigelman, and this file claimed among other things that she was unsuitable because she had said \u201cone of the saddest things I\u2019ve seen in my whole life is spending time filming in a children\u2019s cancer ward in Gaza\u201d. The then ABC managing director Mark Scott ordered a detailed response from corporate affairs, which he took to the board. \u201cI will not cower to the AIJAC,\u201d Scott said, according to Lyons. Scott was also forced to defend McNeill from attacks at Senate estimates after the dossier was sent to key parliamentarians. \u201cBefore this reporter set foot in the Middle East, there was a campaign against her personally taking up that role,\u201d he said in response to a question from senator Eric Abetz. \u201cI am saying that she is a highly recognised and acclaimed reporter \u2026 she deserved that appointment and she needs to be judged on her work.\u201d In a letter to the board, Scott wrote: \u201cThe article [by AIJAC] demonstrates to Sophie McNeill and the ABC that her every word will be watched closely by AIJAC and she starts on the ground with this key interest group sceptical. We are all aware she will be under even closer scrutiny now. As they seek to influence our coverage, this is a pre-emptive \u2018shot across the bows\u2019. \u201cThe pre-emptive attack on McNeill is similar to the approach employed by lobby groups internationally. The US reporter Jodi Rudoren was targeted when she was appointed Jerusalem bureau chief for the New York Times in 2012 and accused of being biased against Israel and unsuitable for the post \u2026 The New York Times refused to bow to the pressure and Rudoren remained in the position.\u201d Lyons writes that AIJAC director Colin Rubenstein had unprecedented access to the Australian, speaking regularly to editors and even suggesting articles the paper should run. After criticising Lyons\u2019s reporting, Rubenstein emailed an alternative article to Cater. Mitchell, who was supportive of Lyons, later told him that Rubenstein would go behind his back and call Cater if he refused to take his call, Lyons writes. \u201cI got upset with Colin when he rang me and attacked [Australian reporter] Elisabeth Wynhausen as \u2018a self-loathing Jew\u2019. I thought it was inappropriate for him to be making that kind of comment about one of my staff. For some time after that I stopped taking his calls.\u201d Lyons argues that Australian journalists should not accept the trips to Israel organised by the lobby . \u201cDuring my time in Israel I would come to believe that Australia\u2019s uncritical support of Israel is both illogical and unhealthy,\u201d he writes. \u201cFor more than 20 years, Australians have read and heard pro-Israel positions from journalists, editors, politicians, trade union leaders, academics and students who have returned from the all-expenses-paid Israel lobby trips. In my opinion, no editors, journalist or others should take those trips: they grotesquely distort the reality and are dangerous in the sense that they allow people with a very small amount of knowledge to pollute Australian public opinion.\u201d Rubenstein told the Guardian he had spoken to editors over the years, including Cater. \u201cI find it hard to see in what way this is nefarious or improper.\u201d He added: \u201cI certainly did speak to Chris Mitchell about Elisabeth Wynhausen in 2006, and specifically about a piece which read like a \u2018hit job\u2019 on both AIJAC and myself, while evoking all too familiar caricatures. I felt entitled to some right of reply - which I received in the form of a letter. \u201cI do not recall ever calling her a \u2018self-loathing Jew\u2019 and that does not sound like the kind of terminology I would use. As for Chris Mitchell\u2019s claim about ceasing to take my calls, I must say I was not aware he felt that way at the time \u2013 which shows how infrequently I actually spoke to him. \u201cWe did put together a public document explaining why we thought Sophie McNeill \u2026 was an inappropriate choice for Middle East correspondent for the taxpayer funded ABC, with its statutory obligations of impartiality. \u201dEverything we do - critiquing media stories; contacting editors, politicians and journalists and explaining our point of view to them; writing our our letters and op/eds; making complaints \u2013 are absolutely normal elements of deliberation and debate in a democratic society. \u201cI would call on those who oppose our views, including Mr Lyons, to engage with different views in a democratic, tolerant and constructive spirit, rather than demand, as he appears to be doing, that those who disagree with him be silenced or suppressed.\u201d The Guardian approached Cater but he declined to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
