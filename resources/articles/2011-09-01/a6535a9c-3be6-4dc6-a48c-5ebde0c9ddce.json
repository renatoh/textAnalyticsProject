She lives in London and is now in a relationship We were at Portsmouth University studying art. He was in the year above. He looked at me and smiled. I thought: \"Ooh yeah, I could do with a bit of that!\" It was brilliant when we got together. Lots of parties and private views. We used to dress up and do each other's make-up. We did argue a bit. We were both strong personalities and were always competing with each other in our work. There was always friction. We split up twice. Chris is a real free spirit. I didn't want to tie him down. But when we got back together after the first break-up it felt like we were just friends. It just felt too sad to let it all go. He was away in hospital for a while. I started hanging out with his housemates more, including his brother. When Chris came back, we carried on for a bit as a couple, but it didn't feel right. When it ended we were sitting overlooking the sea with a packet of crisps each and said: \"This is it.\" I told him I'd grown close to his brother and later began to see him. I felt bad about the situation. But Chris was fine and we became the friends that we probably always wanted to be. There was not one moment of anger. His story Chris Bienvenu is 31 and unemployed. He lives in Guernsey and is single She did a couple of really dodgy walks past me. She was wearing massive Buffalo boots and was ostrich-like. I thought she looked good. She came up and asked what bands I liked. I said Sonic Youth, Mogwai and Tortoise. And she replied: \"Yeah, they're my favourites, too!\" Months later she told me it was a lie, but I didn't mind. It got serious quickly. I thought I loved her. Our first summer apart was difficult. I lived in Guernsey, she was in Northamptonshire and we didn't have mobiles. I did a painting of her. It's up in her mum's house now. I always was a bit of a commitment-phobe and left her for a week. She found someone else and I thought, \"Shit! I want her,\" and got her back. A good six months before we ended I realised things were changing. I got ill and had to go away. When I came back, we were in the pub and I saw her hugging my brother. She told me she had started to like him. Everyone I know says that must have been terrible. But it wasn't. I was relieved because I wanted to be single again. There was not one moment of anger. She's been my best friend since. It's my only break-up where I've had such a good friendship afterwards.
