The average driver's chances of a speeding conviction will treble under an extension of camera systems and police powers announced by the transport minister John Spellar. Acknowledging his own Mr Average status as a convicted speeder (back in the 1970s), Mr Spellar also approved a further roll-out of the controversial \"netting-off\" process, which allows police to invest speed fine revenue in more cameras. But he accepted the \"deterrence before entrapment\" demand of the AA and other motoring organisations by confining new cameras to accident blackspots and requiring them to be brightly painted. The new powers extend to four more counties the experimental camera systems already in place in eight police force areas, which have led to a dramatic fall in road casualties. Mr Spellar said there was no question that speed traps were highly effective, adding: \"Safety cameras are simply playing a significant role in preventing accidents and loss of life.\" The move, which has been widely predicted as a way of testing public reaction, was agreed after polls by the AA - and independent internet sites for motorists with details of camera locations - showed steady support for extending anti-speeding measures. The government and police are confident that a slow but fundamental change in attitude similar to that over drink driving - once regarded by many as a bit of a lark - has gone too far to be reversed. Visible But Mr Spellar acknowledged concern about excessive fining, particularly in the Thames Valley police area, one of the original eight authorities which have trialled tougher measures since April last year. He said: \"I hope that by instructing local authorities and police to make the cameras more visible, motorists will realise that road safety is our main concern. If they heed the signs and slow down when they see cameras, they, their passengers and pedestrians will be safer and they won't get a ticket. \"These instructions emphasise the government's commitment to using safety cameras as a deterrent against excessive speeding, and not as a means of raising money.\" The eight trial areas - Cleveland, Essex, Glasgow, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, the city of Nottingham, South Wales and Thames Valley - will be joined immediately by Derbyshire, Lancashire, North Wales and Staffordshire. All will additionally be able to lower the speed threshold for fines - now 10% of the limit plus 2mph over - which allows the con viction of drivers doing 35mph in a 30mph zone. North Wales's chief constable, Richard Brundstrom, announced straight away that the fine trigger for 30mph zones in his force area would fall from the currently generous 41mph to exactly 30. The announcement coincided with a report from the Department for Transport's road safety unit, which showed a 47% fall in deaths and serious injuries at the trial areas' camera sites, many of which were accident blackspots, compared with the average over the previous three years. This led to an average 18% fall across the whole of the eight force areas, while the number of drivers caught speeding at camera sites fell from 55% to 16%. That last figure was seized on by supporters of extending the scheme, as proof that \"cleverer\" cameras are dropping speeds rather than hiking fine revenue. A spokesman for the Institute of Advanced Motorists said: \"Motorists who follow the speed limits have nothing to fear from additional speed cameras. But we recognise that they have started to alienate drivers who have been fined after going past hidden cameras, placed behind bridges and trees. We are therefore pleased that these new extra cameras will be made more visible. Every camera should be preceded by a clear reminder of the speed limit. That way, the emphasis will be put on compliance rather than capture.\" Timid Transport 2000 said the trial had saved 109 lives, which made the \"snail's pace of the roll-out\" appear \"timid and pathetic\". The environmental group's assistant director, Lynn Sloman, said: \"Such a successful scheme should be ready to go nationwide straight away. We can only conclude that some ministers, and some local authorities and police forces, are running scared of the motoring lobby. Hundreds of people will now be killed in car crashes because of this failure of nerve.\" The Conservatives' transport spokesman, Nigel Waterson, welcomed the high-visibility measures and hinted at the need for a national review of speed limits - a reform already the official policy of the AA and other motoring organisations: \"Conservatives believe that speed limits should be set at a level that is right for the road and its surroundings, and which vehicles are capable of managing safely.\" The Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, Tom Brake, said: \"The trials have shown that these measures significantly cut road deaths and injuries. The police should not be shy about acting on such evidence. But what we don't want is an explosion of sneaky-cams. The police must make good the minister's assurance that the scheme will not become an undercover operation.\" He was backed by the AA's head of road safety, Andrew Howard, who said: \"Public support for cameras is crucial and the public become uneasy when police are allowed access to fine revenues. With more police forces set to use fine revenue to cover the cost of using cameras, they must be as open as possible about funding, signing and siting of cameras.\" \u0095 Only one in seven boxes actually contains a camera \u0095 There are approximately 4,500 boxes across Britain \u0095 The speed camera Gatso is named after 1950s racing driver and inventor Maurice Gatsonides \u0095 The average speeding fine is \u00a360 plus three points \u0095 The first camera was installed on the A316 on Twickenham Bridge, London \u0095 Each camera costs between \u00a330,000 and \u00a380,000 to buy and install \u0095 There is an average of one speed camera for every 30 miles of road \u0095 Highway agency figures reveal that cameras in London cut fatal accidents by 70% and saved \u00a320m a year in accident costs after their introduction in 1992 \u0095 There is an average of 1m convictions a year \u0095 Out of every \u00a360 speeding fine, \u00a328 goes on administration costs \u0095 The highest speed recorded on camera was a Porsche doing 129mph in a 50mph zone \u0095 Each flash lasts 0.125 of a second \u0095 There is a device on the market which warns drivers of the location of speed cameras.
