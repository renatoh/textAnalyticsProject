Endemol and Electronic Arts [EA] will team up to allow viewers to create online representations of themselves which they can enter into virtual versions of hit television programmes. Among the first fruits of the partnership will be a version of Big Brother allowing users at home to compete against each other in their own versions of the show. The \"avatars\" will also be able to take part in versions of other Endemol shows such as Deal or No Deal. A website, Virtualme.com, will launch in the summer to coincide with the new series of Big Brother and will use new avatar creation software to allow people to create lifelike virtual representations of themselves. Endemol's chief creative officer, Peter Bazalgette, said it represented a new phase in the relationship between viewers and programme-makers, allowing them to participate in their favourite shows in addition to influencing the action. \"Big Brother was a pioneer of interactivity in television entertainment. Viewers were able to vote and shape the course of the action. But this is a level of interactivity that is wholly different,\" he said. Unveiling the project at the MipTV festival in Cannes, Mr Bazalgette said the move was a reaction to the changing media consumption habits of younger viewers and the possibilities opened up by widespread broadband connections. \"We're told that people are spending more time online than they are watching TV. Both markets are important and this has huge implications for content creators. Our opportunity with EA is to develop ideas that embrace the way people are consuming entertainment today,\" he said. Gerhard Florin, executive vice-president and general manager of EA International, said the partnership would combine the \"best of TV and video games to appeal to mass market audiences and change the face of entertainment\". The projects would build on the success of The Sims, a series of games which have sold more than 70m copies globally. Revenues are likely to come from advertising and small incremental payments from users. The partnership will be seen as one of the most significant moves yet among broadcasters grappling with the challenge of adapting to converging media platforms and exploding choice. Endemol already has a division devoted to producing programmes and interactive ideas exclusively for mobile phones."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
