Now Leonardo DiCaprio is starring in a different role \u2013 taking his powerful new eco-documentary to the White House, in the hope it can help restart President Obama\u2019s battle against global warming. It\u2019s an issue of importance to both men. Obama, who appears in the documentary, Before the Flood, is using the last days of his presidency to make environmental protection a central pillar of his legacy. Last month he created the world\u2019s largest ecologically protected area when he expanded Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea, a marine reserve in his native Hawaii, to encompass more than half a million square miles. He also gave \u201cmarine national monument\u201d status to 4,913 sq miles off the New England coast. Two years ago, DiCaprio \u2013 who has raised money for protecting tigers, orangutans and elephants \u2013 was designated a UN messenger of peace, with a special focus on climate change. The White House screening of Before the Flood, which follows DiCaprio as he travels to parts of the world including Greenland, the Pacific islands, Sumatra and industrial regions of China, precedes a global release via National Geographic later this month. DiCaprio and the film\u2019s director, Fisher Stevens, hope to use it in the run-up to next month\u2019s US presidential and Senate elections. They plan to show the film on college campuses and across swing states, including Florida, where Senator Marco Rubio is up for re-election. \u201cRubio is a climate change denier, and we want to get these deniers out of Congress, to make them understand the Paris [climate] accords are important and that we need to do more,\u201d Stevens said. The film-makers claim 38 US senators accept money from the energy industry, in effect blocking the passage of environmental legislation. \u201cThese people are not necessarily climate deniers. They\u2019re just in the pockets of the energy industry, even though that\u2019s at the expense of all of us,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cAnd [Republican presidential candidate] Donald Trump has said he\u2019s going to try to kill the Paris accords if elected.\u201d Last month DiCaprio told the audience after the film\u2019s world premiere at the Toronto international film festival: \u201cWe cannot afford, at this critical moment in time, to have leaders in office that do not believe in the modern science of climate change.\u201d Before the Flood\u2019s release comes as statistics relating to the health of the planet worsen. Last week the Scripps Institution of Oceanography announced it was safe to conclude that global CO2 levels will not drop below 400 parts per million this year \u2013 \u201cor ever again for the indefinite future\u201d. The figure is seen as the point at which global warming becomes irreversible. DiCaprio and Stevens came up with the idea to make the documentary while in the Gal\u00e1pagos islands with the oceanographer Sylvia Earle. \u201cWe were frustrated with our government, and I felt if the media isn\u2019t getting to the population about climate change, maybe Leonardo can,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cSo the message is, it\u2019s up to all of us. It\u2019s a simplistic message but it really is.\u201d Despite the intransigence of US legislators, Obama is using his last months in office to establish his legacy as the most environmentally effective president since Theodore Roosevelt created national parks. In Obama\u2019s reading of the issue, climate change is as much a national security issue as an environmental one. He tells the film-makers: \u201cIn addition to the sadness I\u2019d feel if my kids can never see a glacier the way I did in Alaska, even if you were unsentimental about that, you\u2019ve got to be worried about national security and the capacity of the world order to survive the kinds of strains climate scientists are predicting.\u201d Sixty-one countries, including China and the US, representing about 48% of global emissions, have adopted the Paris accords. Countries representing at least 55% of emissions have to adopt the accords for them to be ratified. The film-makers visit Pope Francis in the Vatican, Obama in Washington, political leaders in the Pacific islands of Vanuatu and Kiribati, climate scientists in Greenland and the Indian conservationist Sunita Narain, who explains to DiCaprio that access to energy is as much an issue as climate change for 300 million Indians. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this to you, as an American, but your consumption is really going to put a hole in the planet,\u201d Narain tells DiCaprio. \u201cWe need to put the issue of lifestyle and consumption at the centre of climate negotiations. \u201d DiCaprio responds that it\u2019s difficult to present to Americans the argument that they need to change their lifestyle. \u201cI would also argue that it\u2019s probably not going to happen,\u201d he says. If the climate crisis is to be solved, it will be because \u201crenewables will become cheaper the more we invest into them, and that will solve the problem\u201d. But Narain shakes her head. The film-makers have enlisteded Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, the pair behind the The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, for the soundtrack. They use Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights \u2013 which made a strong impression on the young DiCaprio \u2013 to frame the progress of humankind\u2019s impact on the planet, from innocence to Bosch\u2019s final panel of darkness and ruin. How far off are we now, they wonder? \u201cWhat haunts me is the last panel, with the planet in ruins, charred and blackened skies,\u201d DiCaprio muses. \u201cIf this was a movie we could write our way out of this mess, but real life isn\u2019t a movie and we can\u2019t pretend we know how this is going to end.\u201d He adds: \u201cWhat we can do is control what we do next, how we live our lives, what we consume \u2013 and how we vote, to let our leaders know that we know the truth.\u201d One passage of the documentary takes place during the filming of The Revenant, when director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu was forced to move production 9,000 miles from a snow-free Canadian location to Argentina in search of a snowy landscape."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
