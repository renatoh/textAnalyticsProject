It was the summer holidays and my dad's video production company was having its IT infrastructure replaced. Fascinated, I hung around to watch the guys working on it. A year later, with my parents' help, I started my own web-hosting business funded mainly by my pocket money. After GCSEs, I started A-levels at Barnfield College, but it wasn't really for me \u2013 I felt I needed a more practical approach to learning. I managed to secure a place on a foundation degree in computer science at the college, which I later topped up to a degree at the University of Bedfordshire. I also did a professional qualification in computer networking, the Cisco Certified Network Professional, alongside my studies. It was the staff at Barnfield College who first suggested I get involved in WorldSkills. It is such a prestigious competition I didn't really need much persuasion. After a tough selection process, I feel proud to have been selected to represent the UK in my skill area and it has given me courage and confidence in my abilities. What I love most about IT is looking at its infrastructure, at how and why it works. When you type something into Google, the information doesn't just magically appear. Your information goes from where you live to the company base in San Jose, California and it's got to get there somehow. It's people like me who make sure it does. I'm also fascinated by the issue of hacking. To prevent it, you have to actually understand the mind of the hacker, and some IT professionals have to be able to demonstrate hacking skills to show how they can put safeguards in place. There are some really interesting ethical questions around that. In the long term I'd like to work for myself, but I need a few years experience at a blue-chip company first. Competing in WorldSkills London 2011 should help me develop the experience I need quicker. The four-day competition in October will be tough, but there is absolutely no difference between what I do in the real working world and what I'll be doing at WorldSkills London 2011. You have to set up a network for a small business on the first day, a small to medium-sized business on the second day, a bigger company on the third day and a massive enterprise on the last day, which are just the kind of tasks I could be dealing with in any working week. I'm drawn to the power of working with IT. I once installed a program on my dad's computer where I could lock down the machine, which I thought was hilarious, but I don't think my dad was that impressed.

He will be representing the UK in IT network systems administration at WorldSkills London 2011, which is sponsored by Cisco."}, "isHosted": false}}}
