The shadow chancellor said the leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, was correct when she questioned the prime minister\u2019s word as he outlined plans for Labour\u2019s first 100 days in government. His comments came at a launch of Labour\u2019s priorities in its first 100 days in office, including a promise to end austerity on 5 February with a first budget if elected to government on Thursday. Labour is expected to intensify criticisms of Johnson\u2019s reliability in the final three days of the campaign as it seeks to close down a 14-point deficit behind the Conservatives in the polls. McDonnell said he agreed with Foster, who on Monday morning indicated that she could not trust the prime minister after he broke his word over the Brexit deal in Northern Ireland. \u201cIsn\u2019t it interesting that as the prime minister tours around different constituencies, he finds it incredibly difficult even to mix with people \u2026 What we\u2019re getting back on the doorstep is he\u2019s probably the least trusted politician that people have ever experienced. \u201cArlene Foster, I think, has come to a judgment this morning which is echoed right the way across the country; this is a man whose word you cannot trust. \u201cI agree with Arlene Foster \u2013 you won\u2019t hear those words very often \u2013 you can\u2019t trust him,\u201d he said. At his final major speech of the campaign, held in Waterloo, central London, McDonnell said: \u201cMy first act as chancellor will be to write to the Office for Budget Responsibility, asking them to begin their preparations for my first budget, which will be given on 5 February \u2013 the date when almost 10 years of cuts will come to an end.\u201d He said the three priorities for the Treasury of the next Labour government would be to end austerity in social security and public services, invest in communities as part of Labour\u2019s green industrial revolution, and bring key utilities into public ownership under democratic management. The planned measures include putting more money into an emergency package of reforms to universal credit while Labour designs a replacement social security system, introducing a real living wage of \u00a310 an hour for workers over 16, providing funding for a 5% pay rise for all public sector workers and enacting the department spending plans promised in Labour\u2019s \u201cgrey book\u201d, Funding Real Change, putting billions more into schools, hospitals and social care. McDonnell said Labour must confront the two problems of a climate crisis and the devastation wrought by 10 years of austerity. \u201cThere is a twin emergency in this country. These next few days are going to be key in addressing them,\u201d he said. \u201cOur green industrial revolution will deliver the changes we need to avert climate catastrophe. And it will put British industry back on the map, bringing prosperity to every part of our country. It will give every community something to be proud of.\u201d McDonnell also used his speech on Monday to set out fresh details of Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans, including creating people\u2019s assemblies as part of the oversight for the renationalised utilities. McDonnell has said he \u201cwould expect\u201d the DUP to support a Labour government\u2019s programme but ruled out any attempt at a pact if the party failed to win a outright majority. \u201cIf we were in a minority position, there\u2019d be no deals, no pacts, no coalitions or anything like that. \u201cIt will be up to other parties to actually take their decision on what aspects of that programme they\u2019ll support and those that they don\u2019t. \u201cOver the years I have worked with individual DUP politicians. I can\u2019t see them voting against the real living wage, I can\u2019t see them voting against the levels of investment that we want to put in right the way across the country, including Northern Ireland.\u201d Asked to comment on a report in the Sunday Times which claimed that McDonnell could take over as an interim leader if Labour lose and Corbyn resigns, he said that it was not a valid question because Labour would win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
