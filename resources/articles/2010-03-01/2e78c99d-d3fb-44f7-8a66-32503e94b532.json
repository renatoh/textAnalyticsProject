This documentary, available for just a few days in cinemas before going to DVD, shows their progress turning into the hippest sort of royal visit, with Jack and Meg as rock bluebloods cheerfully mixing with awestruck peoples of the North American dominions. Cinephiles will be waiting for the band to crash into their version of the There Is a Man! song from Citizen Kane: Jack only gives us a fragment of that, but in even more of an apocalyptic howl than usual. Looking like Johnny Depp's squat, muscly younger brother, with a voice that seems about to scratch itself into a thousand pieces, White has charisma, and Meg's weird, mute presence adds to the prevailing oddity. A diverting, if obviously celebratory guide to the band."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
