While we can all agree that there are more important issues - even that there are more important animal welfare issues - MPs have been patiently working for this for seven years despite procedural obstruction supported by most Tory and many Lib Dem MPs, and despite fanatical opposition by the unelected house. It would be seen as ludicrous if we collapsed at the last hurdle. Nick Palmer MP Lab, Broxtowe The latest peers' amendments to the hunting bill include one to exempt the hunting of stoats and weasels, as well as to continue hunting fox, deer, hare and mink - thus actually increasing the types of animals to be listed, and hunted, under the bill. Thus it is unreasonable for you to suggest that: \"it is not too late for MPs to embrace the compromise\" - there is no compromise on offer. And how, indeed, can there be a compromise on cruelty? Peers have voted, for a consecutive year, to remove the ban on deer hunting, to remove the ban on hare hunting and on hare-coursing events. These bans were part of the government's original hunting bill and backed by a huge majority of MPs. The registration system peers have proposed significantly widens and weakens the government's original bill - effectively permitting hunting with dogs to continue. Constitutionally, the use of the Parliament Act is in the hands of the Commons, not the government. And, given the reluctance of the peers to accept society's stand against the cruelty of hunting, it looks set to be invoked on Thursday - a move the RSPCA welcomes wholeheartedly. John Rolls RSPCA If there is no hunting, foxes will be controlled - indeed, eliminated - by \"lamping\". Only the existence of hunting now prevents \"lamping\" on a wide scale. \"Lamping\" is extremely cruel and desperately dangerous. Cruel because a 12-bore shotgun is inadequate to kill a large animal like a fox; unless very close, wounding most frequently occurs. However, following a ban on hunting, the inevitable and massive increase in the ownership of rifles, and the firing of them at night, is a horrific prospect to those living and working in the countryside. Three people have been accidentally shot by \"lamping\" in the past two months; two boys, of 12 and 13, shot dead; one man shot and seriously wounded through the chest; and many near misses. It is only the existence of hunting that currently prevents the massive use of rifles at night to control - and soon to eliminate - foxes in this country. I hope this will be seriously considered by MPs. A compromise bill which allows for the properly regulated continuation of hunting as the best and least inhumane method of controlling and managing the fox population, is surely the best answer. Hugh Pitman Malmesbury, Wilts The hunting bill has been passed repeatedly by overwhelming majorities in the Commons, and was included by many MPs in their personal election addresses to the voters who elected them. Opposition to it was a policy of many candidates who were rejected by the voters. If the Lords is allowed to frustrate the bill, then we live not in a democracy but in a society in which legislation on some issues can only be enacted by permission of unelected grandees. Christopher Clayton Waverton, Cheshire I have a letter from Blair when he was leader of the opposition, stating that a Labour government would make a free vote available on abolition of hunting with dogs, and that his position is that he would vote for abolition. Has he ever voted for abolition? Roger Parker Ledbury, Herefordshire"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
