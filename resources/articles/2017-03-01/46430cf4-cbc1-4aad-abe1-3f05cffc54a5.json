Video assistant referees 'could change football forever'", "bodyText": "It is hoped that the introduction of video assistant referees (VARs) on a trial basis in next season\u2019s FA Cup will ensure incidents such as Diego Maradona\u2019s infamous \u201cHand of God\u201d goal and player simulation will become a thing of the past, although the body behind its implementation has admitted there remain some grey areas that must be thoroughly tested before the system is ratified for next year\u2019s World Cup. Last week the Football Association announced that VARs will be utilised from the third round of the FA Cup in 2018 after successful trials that have been organised by the International Football Association Board (Ifab) \u2013 the organisation that determines the laws of the game \u2013 in several countries over the past 12 months. The system, under which video referees and an assistant will analyse \u201cmatch-changing situations\u201d from a central location or a facility at the stadium, has been designed to adjudicate only when a clear error has been made by the match referee, including goals, penalties, straight red cards and cases of mistaken identity. \u201cThe philosophy is minimum interference for maximum benefit. This is not designed for there to be 15-20 decisions per match,\u201d said the former Premier League referee David Elleray, who is now Ifab\u2019s technical director. \u201cThis could change the face of football in terms of player behaviour. It\u2019s much more difficult for them to dive or commit violent conduct. It can also be an important tool against match-fixing. There are still several grey areas but what we are aiming to do is spend 2017 to refine it and make a decision over whether this will benefit football.\u201d Under the new protocol, which will also be implemented in several top-flight leagues including Germany\u2019s Bundesliga next season, match referees will still be required to make a decision based on their view of an incident. If necessary, they can then stop play for an on-field review (OFR) by signalling the outline of a television screen, but only if neither side has a good attacking possibility. OFRs will usually be reserved for \u201csubjective\u201d decisions such as bad tackles, with real-time speed replays used for fouls and slow-motion replays reserved for \u201cpoint of contact\u201d offences such as handballs. The referee will indicate the outcome of the review on the basis of whether the decision was clearly wrong and then restart the game with the appropriate action. During the match the VAR \u2013 a current or former referee \u2013 and his assistant will also automatically check all potentially contentious incidents using broadcaster\u2019s footage and have the power to alert the match referee if they perceive a major mistake has been made. In that case the match referee will receive an alert to signify that he must stop the game when appropriate to view a replay, with the final decision resting with them once more. There will be no appeal process available to coaching staff and any players who attempt to influence the official by making a TV signal will be booked. However, it is the decision not to allow reviews of incidents such as yellow cards or corners that could be the biggest bone of contention, even if Elleray believes that a compromise was necessary to ensure the general flow of the game is not interrupted. \u201cWe had to draw some lines to get this balance between minimum interference and maximum benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you allow one that was clearly wrongly given, then logic says for justice you have to allow a review for one that wasn\u2019t given and should have been given. We accept it\u2019s a bit of a flaw but it\u2019s to say, \u201cActually we can deal with red but, if you start dealing with yellow, you really have to deal with all yellows.\u201d \u201cThis is one of the challenges we will have with this system. People will always be pushing to have more and more decisions reviewable but the more reviewable decisions you have the more it will interrupt the flow of the game. We\u2019re not aiming to achieve perfection. We\u2019re aiming to look at what we would call real scandals. The 10 worst decisions of my career, probably most of them could have been solved by looking at the video fairly quickly.\u201d As yet it is undecided whether replays will be shown in stadiums or on television, with that decision likely to rest with individual associations. Elleray believes a minimum of six to eight cameras will be required to implement the system effectively at grounds and the referee will watch the incidents in new review areas located at the side of the pitch. \u201cThey should forget about the VAR when they are making their decisions,\u201d Elleray said. \u201cThey should not change the way they referee. But they should know that in a way there is a comfort. If they make a complete Horlicks of it, then it will be there to save them. \u201cTo some extent all referees live with the scars of their worst decisions on their backs. This will remove quite a lot of scars. In American Football, when a decision is made by using a video, people say they don\u2019t tend to remember the original mistake. They remember the correct decision.\u201d And in an era that has seen referees become increasingly criticised, Elleray, who spent seven years on Fifa\u2019s elite list, hopes the new system will mean that becomes a thing of the past. \u201cReferees are often in the spotlight because of their mistakes \u2013 if one does well, then no one mentions him,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might take the spotlight off them. Part of our future assessment of referees will be how many of their decisions are overturned. The best referee will take some pride in having the least.\u201d Clement rang Riley to offer backing to under-fire referee Taylor Paul Clement felt compelled to telephone Mike Riley after Anthony Taylor erroneously awarded a penalty against Swansea City during their win over Burnley last Saturday \u2013 to ask the head of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited to tell the 38-year-old official he believes he is a \u201cvery good referee\u201d. Clement also suggested that dishonest players are not helping officials, with the Swansea manager highlighting the way that Luis Su\u00e1rez \u201ccons the referee\u201d to win a penalty for Barcelona in their 6-1 victory over PSG. \u201cI actually called Mike Riley, but it wasn\u2019t to have a go \u2013 actually on the contrary,\u201d Clement said, reflecting on Taylor\u2019s decision to give Burnley a penalty after Sam Vokes handled the ball. \u201cMaybe I would have felt differently if the result had gone against us. It\u2019s easier to do this kind of thing when you\u2019ve won the game and the decision that hurt you didn\u2019t hurt you as bad as it could have. \u201cSo I called Mike and said Anthony had spoken to me at half-time and said that he called the decision in an honest way. I said to him: \u2018I don\u2019t think you would have done it in any other way, but the fact is you got it wrong and it\u2019s a big decision.\u2019 So I was very disappointed. But I said to Mike: \u2018I don\u2019t believe that he did anything different to calling it honestly, and he made a mistake and we can all do that.\u2019 I actually said: \u2018I want you to tell him that I do think he\u2019s a very good referee,\u2019 because I think he is. I\u2019ve come across him before, he referees in the Champions League. \u201cI think referees have got a thankless task sometimes because the other thing is, not all players are honest. And with the speed of the game they can fool a referee into giving a decision. I don\u2019t think that was necessarily the case in the games that we\u2019ve had. But I think if you look at the two penalties for Barcelona against PSG, in my opinion the one on Neymar is a penalty, Su\u00e1rez cons the referee \u2013 that\u2019s not a penalty \u2026 but the referee clearly thinks it is. He doesn\u2019t have the help to be able to look back at that, he\u2019s calling it in real time, so it\u2019s very, very difficult.\u201d Stuart James"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
