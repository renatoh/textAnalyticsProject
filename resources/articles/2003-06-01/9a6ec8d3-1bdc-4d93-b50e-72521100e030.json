From Big Brother to Pop Idol to MTV, programme producers have fallen over themselves to take advantage of the medium. So much so that there is barely a game show, chat show or entertainment format on the air that doesn't have a text-messaging element. Not only does text interaction increase loyalty to a particular show and make viewers feel as if they are a small part of the action, but it also brings in much needed cash. Channel 4's Big Brother, back on our screens for a fourth time, is again innovative in its use of text messaging, keeping the money rolling in by inviting viewers to text in their votes and views and sending them regular news updates in return. But until now programme-makers have been limited in how innovative they could be with the integration of text messages into their shows. Media Guardian revealed last year that thousands of text messages were arriving too late to make any difference to programmes they were supposed to be influencing, or simply being discarded due to an avalanche of texts. Bottlenecks at the mobile networks made anything that was time-sensitive a virtual impossibility because there was no way of telling when text messages arrived, or even if they had arrived at all. Now, Celador, producer of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, believes it has found a solution. Working with Whoosh, a mobile company set up last year by former Channel Five marketing executive David Bainbridge, it has announced ambitious plans to allow viewers to play along in real time using their mobile phones. From this week, viewers of Classic Millionaire, the new ITV daytime show that recycles classic Millionaire appearances, will be able to play along by text messaging their answers from the \u00a31,000 question onwards. The game will cost \u00a31 a time to play, plus the normal cost of sending each text. The player who answers the most questions in the shortest time will win a \u00a31,000 prize. Bruce van den Bergh, head of digital at Celador, claims this is the first time anything like this has been attempted anywhere in the world. If it is successful, it will be incorporated into the new series of Millionaire in the autumn. \"We are trying to find different ways in which people can consume the brand. People love engaging with the show and this gives them one more option,\" he says. Celador has already enjoyed success with the interactive TV version of the game as well as versions for games machines, computers and the web. Crucially, the new service will allow winners to be judged on skill rather than luck, adds Van den Bergh. \"One of the reasons it has taken two years to develop is that it is a game of skill and judgment,\" he says. Bainbridge, who headed several text marketing promotions as deputy marketing director at Five, set up Whoosh after becoming frustrated with the limitations placed on broadcasters. In partnership with logistics company Empower Interactive, the company has developed its own return path for text messages that bypasses the congested operators' networks, while also linking into them, thus providing \"the equivalent of a motorway rather than a country B road\". Because the messages are not competing with 50m-plus text messages sent over the main networks every day, broadcasters can be sure that they all arrive within a short time, making quick-fire votes, requests and questions a realistic prospect for the first time. \"The crucial thing is that we know whether you sent your answer in before or after Chris Tarrant read it out,\" says Bainbridge, adding that every message is time-stamped to the second. \"Immediately, you can start to see the implications for a People's Who Wants to be a Millionaire or a People's Weakest Link, with everyone playing along at home,\" he adds. Much of this is already possible with interactive television, but because virtually everyone in the UK has a mobile phone, it makes it viable for TV commissioners to include a substantial element of interactivity in the programme itself, rather than as an add-on. Van den Bergh confirms that if the Classic Millionaire experiment is a success, it will build the application into the prime-time show, with Tarrant telling viewers when to text in their answers. For Celador, interactivity also offers a chance to inject new life into a format that a year ago was looking more than a little jaded. But with the quiz boosted by the publicity surrounding the Major Ingram case and the launch of daytime companion show Classic Millionaire, the added draw of the interactive text element could help to push it back up the ratings charts. According to Bainbridge, the fact that they can now handle high volumes of messages and time them accurately also has huge implications for advertisers and marketers. \"From a brand perspective, you can now have a competition within a 30-second ad, asking people to text in their answers. \"In the next ad break, you could reveal the result, effectively making the break a must-watch. People aren't going to go off and make a cup of tea because they will want to know what happened,\" he predicts. And he believes that the power of having a database of people who have all chosen to interact with the brand or programme could be a huge advantage for broadcasters and advertisers alike. Another useful side effect could be that broadcasters will avoid the hoopla that normally surrounds high-profile voting events, and provide them with the ammunition to reply to tabloid allegations that they purposely engineered singer A to beat singer B, or housemate C to be evicted rather than housemate D. Bainbridge says that the company is already speaking to other TV producers and radio stations about further embedding the technology into their programmes. And given that text messaging is already second nature to virtually everyone in the country, could it be that interactive programming will truly take off not through the remote control, but through the mobile phone?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
