The National Society for Clean Air (NSCA) gave the warning as it launched a report choreographed to coincide with the anniversary the nation's worst single air pollution disaster, in which around 4,000 people died in the capital. The society called on the government to increase its efforts to combat the threat of air pollution. Richard Mills, the secretary general of NSCA, said the \"pea souper smogs are a thing of the past\". But he added: \"Emerging health evidence shows that new sources of pollution provide a continuing threat and official figures may seriously under estimate the level of death and illness.\" The NSCA is calling for the government to reassess the health impacts of air pollution and keep the downward pressure on pollution levels across the whole country. It also wants the government to include greenhouse gases in local air quality action plans. Mr Mills said: \"We accept that levels of many pollutants are on a downward trend. But it is clear that many of us are having our life shortened by continuing exposure to air pollutants. \"Even on a conservative estimate, air pollution is killing 10 times more people than road accidents every year. As individuals we must all take responsibility to reduce our contribution to pollution.\" Friends of the Earth pollution campaigner, Tony Bosworth, accused the government of setting \"weak pollution standards for London, rather than taking tough action to reduce pollution, especially from traffic\". He said: \"The pollution may not be visible but it is still deadly, and is killing hundreds of people prematurely every year. Londoners should have just as much right to breathe clean air as people in the rest of the country\" The air quality minister, Alun Michael, marked the anniversary of the great smog of London by visiting one of the capital's most sophisticated air pollution monitoring sites. Mr Michael visited the site on Marylebone Road in central London, climbing 10 feet to the top of the station to inspect the high-tech equipment. He said: \"I remember the smogs Londoners suffered as I visited the capital most autumns as a child when I visited my uncle, a police officer in the Met. \"The smogs were awful. Nowadays, partly as a result of the Clean Air Act, we are lucky to enjoy much better air quality. Air quality is getting better, and the number of days of poor air quality each year continues to fall. This is as a result of changes in the way our power is generated, less domestic coal fires, and cleaner fuels and cleaner vehicles.\" He said air quality was one of the government's our top priorities \"that air pollution will be very much a part of future transport strategy\". Mr Michael said: \"We face some tough choices. Getting people to switch from coal to gas was relatively easy because people could see it was in their interests. But tackling today's problems is a lot more difficult.\" He said one government target was to have 10% of new cars to be running on ultra low carbon by 2012. London has 80 monitoring stations dotted all over the capital. Inside each are computers and monitoring equipment that suck in air and measure the levels of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and other pollutants. Mr Michael said: \"They also analyse mass composition and size of fine particulants - very small pieces of pollution that can get deep down into the lungs and damage the organs. \"The information is used by a team of researchers at Kings College in London who analyse pollution trends and warn the public of poor air quality on particular days. The data is also used to look at ways of improving air quality.\" Tom Brake, Liberal Democrat spokesman for London, said: \"Whilst pollution is not as visible as 50 years ago, clearly it still has the potential to do very severe harm. In December 1991, 160 Londoners died during a week-long period of high air pollution. \"According to the mayor's draft air quality strategy, published in 2001, 24,000 people a year die prematurely across Britain because of air pollution. We need to do more to bring emissions from motor vehicles in the capital under control.\" The great London smog brought the capital to a standstill in December 1952. Adverse weather conditions and high levels of smoke from coal fires in homes formed a smog that brought death to thousands as it blanketed the capital. The some 4,000 deaths came in just four days. The disaster led directly to the introduction of the Clean Air Act in 1956 which did much to clean up pollution in Britain's town and cities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
