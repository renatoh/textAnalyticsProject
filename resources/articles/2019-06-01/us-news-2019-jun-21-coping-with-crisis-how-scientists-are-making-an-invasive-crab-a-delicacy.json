The European green crab first arrived in the new world more than 200 years go, smuggling itself to American shores in the ballast holds of transatlantic ships. But as the climate emergency warms the bountiful Gulf of Maine faster than 99% of the world\u2019s ocean, the tiny crustacean is now seemingly unstoppable as its population grows unchecked. Along Maine\u2019s long, wrinkled coastline, the climate crisis gives and the climate crisis takes. The warming waters have provided the ideal environment for lobsters, leading to large and profitable hauls. But green crabs have taken hold, devastating soft-shell clam populations depended on for food and income, cutting their harvest to the lowest levels in nearly 90 years while simultaneously destroying eelgrass habitats that serve as nurseries for young fish. For communities that depend on the Gulf of Maine, conversations are shifting from how to stop the warming to how to cope with it. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop the warming now,\u201d says Marissa McMahan, a fisheries scientist with Manomet, a New England not-for-profit that focuses on sustainability and climate crisis. \u201cWe have to accept this is the reality, that the Gulf of Maine is going to be different in 10 or 20 years \u2026 and we have to figure out ways to adapt and live with that.\u201d McMahan is now part of an effort to promote green crabs as a source of food and researching other potential uses for them. As the ecosystem gets upended, she and others hope to turn the green crab into dollars and calories \u2013 and perhaps slow the damage they are doing. \u201c Nothing has evolved yet or appeared yet to act as a predator in terms of keeping their population in check,\u201d said Roger Warner, a writer based in Ipswich, Massachusetts, who founded the Green Crab R&amp;D Project. \u201cSo humans will have to be the predators.\u201d The crabs have been most disruptive to soft-shell clams, a valuable food source dug up by clammers from the mud at low tide in marshes and estuaries in New England. In Maine, soft-shell clam harvests have fallen off significantly over the past three decades. Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias, said that his research has found that as much as 99% of clams in many parts of Maine are dying before they reach adulthood. Many of those are eaten by green crabs. Further south in Ipswich, Massachusetts, the town pays a bounty of $0.40 per pound on green crabs, hoping to save the clams which \u2013 for those who eat them in the US \u2013 put the town on the map. Ipswich shellfish constable Scott LaPreste says the town is currently hauling up about 75,000 pounds of green crabs a year under the program. \u201cIn the past, what we depended on was really cold winters\u201d to control the crab population, he said. \u201cWith the warming of the winters now, we\u2019re not getting that die-off you would expect every winter.\u201d McMahan, the Manomet scientist, first started thinking about green crabs when an art conservator from her native Maine island of Georgetown contacted her after feasting on similar green crabs in Venice, Italy. He wanted to know if people back home were eating them. Americans tend to eat large crabs with lots of meat that offer a big reward for the work of breaking through their shells. At first glance, the green crab looks like too much work for too little meat. But in Venice, green crab is a delicacy, fried up when the crab briefly sheds its hard exoskeleton to grow and eaten whole. In 2017, McMahan and her partner, lobsterman Chris Jamison, traveled to Venice to see how the crab industry worked there. And last summer, Jamison began trapping green crabs and selling molting ones to coastal Maine restaurants at $3 a piece while using other ones as lobster bait. Last fall, Manomet was awarded a quarter-million-dollar grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to work towards creating a green crab market. Warner, the Green Crab R&amp;D founder, envisions a green crab market. Molting crabs would be sold to restaurants and consumers, pulling in the highest price per crab. Meanwhile, non-molting crabs could be boiled into stock or used as flavoring. Then their shells could be used as compost; Warner is hoping to explore their potential as a fertilizer for cannabis, which is now legal in both Massachusetts and Maine. Crab roe is another potential moneymaker while some of the crabs being collected by Manomet were destined to be dog food. \u201cPeople will and can trap for green crabs alongside clamming, but they need the payoff,\u201d said Warner. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re working on inventing these products.\u201d Maine fishermen once went after different species every season which meant a poor catch of one would not mean ruin. But over the years, those fisheries have mostly disappeared. Today, lobster is the dominant catch, but it is anticipated that if waters continue to warm, it too may become less productive. Fishermen such as Jamison say they see the Gulf of Maine changing in real time: he sees more typically tropical fish, lobsters are abundant and a few years ago, he saw a great white shark \u2013 rare in Maine\u2019s waters. But while some promoting green crabs as a food source hope their efforts can restore clam populations, Beal, the University of Maine at Machias professor, believes that is unlikely. \u201cThe most damage that\u2019s occurring by green crabs on soft-shell clams is by crabs that are smaller than your thumbnail,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can trap crabs that are the size of your thumbnail.\u201d Beal calls the green crab the \u201cconsummate invader\u201d due to its ability to \u201cout-reproduce anything else\u201d as well as its breadth of habitat and diet. Meanwhile, Manomet is currently exploring clam aquaculture \u2013 clam farming \u2013 that could give the shellfish better chances of surviving to adulthood and making it to the dinner plate. But on a recent Thursday morning, McMahan remained focused on the crabs as she and two graduate students measured and catalogued the angry crustaceans on a dock in Georgetown. They looked at the underside of the crabs for signs that they were about to molt \u2013 and separated those ready to shed their exoskeleton so they wouldn\u2019t be eaten by the others once they lost their armor. McMahan says introducing a new sea food is an uphill battle in a part of the country where fish that have long disappeared from the Gulf of Maine \u2013 such as cod and haddock \u2013 are still favorites at the supermarket. But as the water warms, she says seafood consumers will have to adjust to reality. \u201cWe need to just fundamentally think differently about seafood and what we eat \u2013 and what is seafood and what\u2019s good \u2013 because it\u2019s changing. We\u2019re going to have different things on our plate going forward,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
