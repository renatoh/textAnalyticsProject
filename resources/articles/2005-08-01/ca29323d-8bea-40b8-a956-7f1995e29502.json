There were to be free buses, children's toys, and the chance to \"touch a turbine\" and learn why they were needed. Three-year-old Owen Thompson was certainly loving it in the Cambrian mountains of west Wales, where the 39 giant turbines of Cefn Croes overlook the rugged scenery and generate enough electricity for 42,000 homes. Owen surveyed the forest of 85-metre (280ft) high machines as their blades serenely spun round at 15 revolutions a minute in the afternoon breeze. \"Wind gooohh...\" was all he could say. \"This is the biggest treat he's ever had,\" said his mum, Sue, an avid supporter of alternatives to nuclear and coal-fired power. \"He's been fascinated by turbines ever since he was tiny. He's an anorak already. He's the future, but actually, he's a bit of a nightmare, continually telling everyone how wonderful they are. This has really kept him quiet.\" Others on the tour were also clearly enjoying the experience. \"I find it truly uplifting to see these things. We've got about 10 years to start reducing emissions on a big scale or we really start feeling climate change,\" said one Friends of the Earth supporter, who asked not to be named. And even the uncommitted were delighted. \"This is an eye-opener. We were uncertain about them before this, but it makes me think they are fine in the right place,\" said Jonathan Reece of Norfolk, on holiday with his family. \"Where's the energy going to come from when the oil and gas runs out? We all have to be more energy-conscious.\" But the wind power industry has faced opposition all the way and Cefn Croes, which opened in June, was one of the most bitterly contested schemes. Much to the consternation of Roger Jones, the representative of Falck industries, which ultimately owns the farm, two of Cefn Croes's leading critics were on the tour. Kaye Little was clearly upset about the wide road bulldozed up the mountain, the ecological damage done to the hill and the resources needed to build the farm. \"I have been up here 100 times and I have watched the desecration of this mountain,\" she said. \"This is industrialisation of the landscape. A lot of the campaigners will never go up here again. Walkers find it unpleasant,\" she said. She rounded on Mr Jones: \"Can you comment on the massive amount of carbon dioxide released by the oxidation of the exposed peat?\" Mr Jones said the land was being restored. \"People have come a long way to see this prestigious wind farm,\" he said. \"Let's give them the chance to see it. Today is a celebration.\" It was then the turn of Martin Wright, who lives only a few miles away and led the campaign against Cefn Croes for five years. \"You said 42,000 homes were being powered by this. But is it not only 23% efficient? Would it not take 2,000 of these schemes to match one nuclear power station?\" Mr Jones, sensing an impromptu public inquiry - something the government had refused to allow - tried to explain how the farm was providing 20% of all Wales's wind energy and saving 150,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide year. He was joined by the Friends of the Earth supporter and, for a moment, a pitched battle in the peatbogs looked possible. But the wind drowned out most of the arguments and the small crowd preferred to admire the machines in the wildness of the countryside. \"I don't think they are nearly as obtrusive as people imagined. They are really rather wonderful, aren't they?\" said Mr Reece. \"I think they are totally awesome,\" said his son Andrew. \"Like really, really big.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
