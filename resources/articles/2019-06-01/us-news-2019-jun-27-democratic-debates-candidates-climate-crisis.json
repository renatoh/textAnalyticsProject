Climate change is expected to feature more in the 2020 election than ever before, as experts offer unsparing warnings that the escalating crisis will deprive the poor of basic human rights. Still, it is not being discussed by most as a top-tier political issue. The first debates \u2013 which feature 20 candidates across two nights and kick off the 2020 election race in earnest \u2013 are being held in Miami, a coastal city that is already seeing the effects of climate change. But the candidates mostly reiterated their campaign talking points and policy proposals, rather than challenging their opponents or conveying the full scope of the problem. The climate questions did not come until the second half of the debate, when the NBC moderator Chuck Todd asked several contenders how they would address the dangerous effects of rising temperatures. Rachel Maddow asked the Washington governor, Jay Inslee, if his extensive plan could \u201csave Miami\u201d, the coastal Florida city watching as oceans creep inward, increasing inland real estate costs and exacerbating flooding. Current science shows that even a significant global effort to stall rising temperatures would not prevent the huge disruptions beginning in Miami and other shoreline communities. \u201cTo my surprise, I\u2019m the only candidate who has made the commitment to make this the top priority,\u201d Inslee said in his concluding comments. \u201cWe can save ourselves. We can save our children. We can save our grandchildren. We can save literally the life on this planet. This is our moment.\u201d He also took a jab at Donald Trump, who denies manmade climate change, saying \u201che says wind turbines cause cancer \u2013 we know they cause jobs.\u201d Inslee, who has made climate change the central pillar of his campaign, is not among the top candidates in the polls. One of the frontrunners in the debate tonight, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, was not asked about the climate crisis but worked it into her response about income inequality. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a worldwide need for green technology, ways to clean up the air, ways to clean up the water. We can be the ones to provide that,\u201d Warren said. She also named climate change as one of the biggest geopolitical threats facing the US, along with the former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, New Jersey senator Cory Booker and former San Antonio mayor and housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. Climate activists are demanding the Democratic National Committee hold a climate-focused debate, to force candidates to engage in more policy specifics. In Washington, youth advocates with the Sunrise Movement watched the debate from a projector screen in front of the DNC headquarters, where they have been protesting. A second round of debates with 10 more Democratic candidates on Thursday night will feature the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who frequently bashes the fossil fuel industry and has long supported broad policies to reduce climate pollution. It will also include former vice-president Joe Biden, who is considered the frontrunner in the Democratic primary race, and initially came under criticism for suggestions his climate plan would rely on continued natural gas use. He has since said he wants to neutralize US greenhouse gas levels by 2050, in line with many other candidates. The only policy solutions discussed during the first debate highlighted how politically intractable the issue can be \u2013 focusing on what people might be willing to sacrifice to stall rising temperatures and more extreme weather. Todd asked the former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke how he would respond to Americans who feel like the government is telling them how to live in pushing for renewable energy and electric cars. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, mentioning talking meeting farmers suffering from recent flooding along the Mississippi River in Iowa. He said he wants the US to spend money on those communities and others dealing with the climate crisis, mobilizing $5tn of spending on renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and carbon capture. The Ohio congressman Tim Ryan, asked about proposals to tax carbon pollution, said Democrats aren\u2019t connecting to the working class enough. The former Maryland congressman John Delaney followed up that \u201call the economists agree a carbon pricing works \u2013 you just have to do it right\u201d. Delaney has a proposal to tax carbon and return the revenues to taxpayers. There was no mention of the Green New Deal \u2013 a blueprint for the climate crisis and inequality that has captivated progressives\u2019 imaginations. Wendy Wendlandt, Environment America\u2019s senior vice-president and political director, said her group was grateful the candidates gave some airtime to climate but will continue to watch closely. \u201cWords are nice, but we need actions to truly address our environmental problems,\u201d she said. Kassie Siegel, climate director of the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, said the night \u201chighlights the need for a dedicated climate debate to understand which candidates are willing to tackle the root of the problem: fossil fuel production and the dirty influence of the world\u2019s largest polluters\u201d. \u201cSpending only seven minutes on climate questions was absurd,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cBut kudos to Governor Inslee and Senator Warren for recognizing the all-encompassing nature of the climate emergency and emphasizing it during other questions throughout.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
