After attending college in his mid-20s, Banks found academic work, and started publishing stories in the late 1960s. In 1974 his first novel, Family Life, came out. A spell living in the West Indies in the mid-70s resulted in The Book of Jamaica (1980), but it was Continental Drift (1985) that proved a breakthrough. Banks was subsequently hired by Jonathan Demme to work on a screen adaptation that never materialised. Affliction (1989) and The Sweet Hereafter (1991) cemented his reputation, as did the film versions of both that followed in the mid-90s. Banks currently teaches at Princeton and his most recent novel, The Darling (2005), is set against the civil turmoil in Liberia. Story: Banks was inspired by a school bus crash in Alton, Texas in 1989 that killed 21 children. He relocated the story to a characteristically icebound New England landscape (the fictional town of Sam Dent, New York). The crash and its aftermath is presented in four sections, each told as a first-person narrative by a different character: the bus driver, the principal witness, the lawyer who leads an attempt to gain compensation, and a survivor. Banks uses the changing perspective to throw light on the moral and emotional subtleties surrounding the trauma - most disturbingly in the final section, when the survivor deliberately wrecks the legal action as revenge against her abusive father. Film-maker: Born in Egypt in 1960 to Armenian parents, Atom Egoyan was raised in Canada after his family emigrated. His early features, including Family Viewing (1987) and The Adjuster (1991), were studies of emotional dependency and addiction. In Calendar (1993), Egoyan himself played a photographer returning to Armenia in an autobiographical cultural essay. He subsequently explored the Armenian genocide in Ararat (2002). For The Sweet Hereafter, Egoyan cast veteran British character actor Ian Holm alongside his regular collaborators, which include his Lebanese-Armenian wife Arsin\u00e9e Khanjian. How book and film compare: Egoyan dispenses with the novel\u2019s four-voice structure, reconfiguring events so that the lawyer, Mitchell Stephens, becomes the central figure. Stephens\u2019 difficulties with his own daughter, Zoe, therefore become more significant to the narrative, paralleling the town\u2019s plight over losing so many children. Egoyan also removes the sexual abuse element from the final act, making the motivation of the wheelchair-bound victim, Nicole, considerably more ambiguous. Egoyan considered the story a \u201cgrim fairytale\u201d, and introduced a Pied Piper motif (along with a medieval music score) to underline its fabular nature. Inspirations and influences: Part of a Canadian film-making generation that included David Cronenberg, Egoyan has cut out an individual path, but shares with Cronenberg a fascination with fetishistic and addictive behaviour, though to less gruesome effect. As a poet of dislocation and isolation, Egoyan\u2019s closest equivalent is arguably American writer-director Paul Schrader, who made an adaptation of another Banks novel, Affliction , in the same year as The Sweet Hereafter ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
