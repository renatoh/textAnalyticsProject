Yesterday Dixon played the difficult Brabazon course in 66, six under, to take the lead in the first round of the Benson &amp; Hedges International Open. He is one shot ahead of Padraig Harrington and two in front of the defending champion Angel Cabrera and the 2001 winner, Henrik Stenson. It is the first time Dixon has led a full European tour event. Dixon, now 26, was leading amateur in the 2001 Open championship during which, in the second round, he hit a drive at the 18th that was measured at 404 yards. He has the gift of length but not always of judgment and Chandler was afraid that his young charge's professional career might dissipate through impetuosity. \"As an amateur he used to overpower things,\" said Chandler, \"but what he didn't realise is that in the professional game, everyone overpowers things.\" To counter that all-out propensity, and to help Dixon through qualifying school last November, a career caddie, Andy Bladon, was hired with the brief to curb his outright aggression. It worked in the sense that Dixon got his card but at the same time he felt his natural ability was being unnaturally reined in. \"Andy is a great caddie,\" he said yesterday, \"but he plays a different game to the one I do. He's a bit old school and I like to be more aggressive, so we had a lot of confrontation on shots. I'm only new out here, so I didn't want to stick with someone who didn't understand my way of playing.\" Bladon went three weeks ago, Wayne Clark is now on the bag and, despite a disagreement on the 8th, Dixon says things are working out nicely. Having missed the fairway Clark urged a lay-up short of the stream by the green. But Dixon does not ordinarily do lay-ups and he chose to go for the green. He carried the water comfortably, which was one up to the player, but went through the green into the back fringe, from whence he failed to get up and down. All square, then? \"It didn't work out great either way, really,\" Dixon said with a smile. Four birdies and two eagles countered two bogeys, the eagles coming at the 3rd and 15th holes, hitting driver and then three-wood both times and holing from 18 and 15 feet respectively. Back in Chandler's office last August part of the harangue concerned Harrington. Dixon was told: \"You could do worse than look at Padraig. He's not the most talented on tour but he's achieved what he's achieved by working harder at the game than almost anyone.\" That was evident again yesterday when the world No10 said that he had spent three weeks working on an aspect of his game, only to find that all he had done was perfect a fault and had to begin all over again this week. As a result he felt that yesterday's 67 was more mechanical than natural although this perpetually dissatisfied golfer did confess to having missed only one fairway. He also admitted that he hit a pretty decent chip to birdie the long 15th. Lying on hard ground to the left of the green, on a down slope, with a hump in front of him and a green that ran away from him, he had a spot the size of a sixpence on which to pitch. He hit it, the ball ran to within 18 inches of the hole and afterwards he said: \"It's things like that which make all the hard work worthwhile.\" Afterwards he signed his card twice. Three years ago, when leading by five after three rounds, he was disqualified for not signing one of them once and that is a memory that may fade but will never be forgotten. \u0095 Annika Sorenstam made seven birdies in a six-under-par 66 to tie for the lead after the first round of the Nichirei Cup tournament. The 32-year-old Swede sank four consecutive birdie putts after the turn in rainswept conditions at the Yomiuri club in Tokyo. She shares first place with the Japanese Junko Yasui, who recorded an eagle at the 11th."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
