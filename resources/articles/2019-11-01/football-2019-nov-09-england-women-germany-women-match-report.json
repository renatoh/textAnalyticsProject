We can talk about the emotional highs about the World Cup, but when you get into November that becomes an excuse. And we\u2019re not having any excuses. It starts with me I\u2019ve got to take responsibility for those results, I\u2019m the one that picks the team. I\u2019m the one that sets the tactics, I train them. I talked to them. I communicate with them. \u201cStart with me and finish with me, ultimately because the team always reflects the manager and at this moment in time the results aren\u2019t good enough. Which means I\u2019m not good enough.\u201d Alexandra Popp\u2019s early unmarked header had put Germany ahead inside nine minutes before Ellen White scored in her first England game since injury sidelined the 30-year-old following her six-goal haul at the World Cup in France. White\u2019s one-touch strike came on the stroke of half-time after Keira Walsh floated a looping ball from deep on to the toes of her Manchester City teammate; but B\u00fchl skipped into the box and slipped the ball past Mary Earps in the 90th minute to douse the mood of the rain-dampened fans. When the team sheet arrived there was fairly universal agreement; it was good. Goalkeeper Earps, who is now shining for Manchester United, was preferred to Carly Telford and Ellie Roebuck while Leah Williamson retained her place in central defence alongside Steph Houghton despite the return of Millie Bright. Inside 10 minutes, though, Wembley saw the best and worst of Earps. First, at full stretch, a graze of her fingertips forced Popp\u2019s lashed effort from the left on to the bar, but the keeper could have done more to keep out the Germany captain when she headed powerfully through Earps\u2019 arms. It would be unfair to point the finger solely at Earps, however. The nippy cross from Kathrin Hendrich caught Williamson and Houghton napping while Lucy Bronze and Alex Greenwood left too much space by drifting narrower. It was an all-too-familiar sight. England under Neville have conceded 24 goals and 10 have been directly from crosses. With Germany dominant and pouncing on the too frequent sloppy passes England\u2019s defence once again looked on the ropes. It was Nikita Parris and Jill Scott combining on the right who provided England\u2019s most threatening moments and Beth Mead found more and more space on the left, enough to win a penalty getting to White\u2019s cross just ahead of the goalkeeper, Merle Frohms. However, Parris\u2019s effort was in the centre of the goal, lacked power and Frohms\u2019 legs deflected the ball high and over to make it three missed penalties in four in an England shirt for the Lyon winger. With a minute left of the half, though, Bronze touched the ball back to Walsh who lofted a stunning pass over the top of the defence and White slotted past Frohms with one touch. With England having played Germany 20 times in 35 years but only recording one win and four draws in that time \u2013 including a 3-0 drubbing in front of the previous home record of 45,619 in their last Wembley outing in 2014 \u2013 the goal seemed to lift a weight off the players\u2019 shoulders. But once again a lapse in concentration proved costly. A swathe of substitutions had taken the sting out of the closing 10 minutes but it was all too easy for B\u00fchl, in the final minute of normal time, to dance around Houghton and score past Earps. Neville described his team\u2019s concession of late goals as a sickness. \u201cYou cannot lose concentration for a split second,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to find is that consistency of performance and behaviour. That is the ultimate challenge for this group of players and for myself as a manager.\u201d With dead balls, sluggish starts and lapses in concentration features of Neville\u2019s reign and there being no sign of a remedy, the pressure is mounting. Houghton, though, thinks the criticism should not just be directed at the manager. \u201cI think some of it\u2019s been really unfair,\u201d she said. \u201cAs players we have to take responsibility. For us as individuals and as players our performances can be better, but we\u2019re in it together. It\u2019s all about making sure that we\u2019re all on the same page. \u201cWe know that there\u2019s going to be criticism that comes our way but I think we can be a little bit more positive than we have been over the last few months. But ultimately the only way that we can get positive remarks is if we keep winning.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
