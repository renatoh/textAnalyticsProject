If you have built up a nest egg to boost your pension, it's time to think about making it work for you. But with interest rates at their lowest for nearly 40 years and stock markets falling this is no easy task. We asked four IFAs, chosen at random from the yellow pages and IFA Promotions website (www.unbiased.co.uk), what they would recommend for a 60-year-old with savings of \u00a350,000, who was wary of big risks but keen to boost her modest pension. She'd also like some capital appreciation to keep up with inflation. \u0095 Michael Lockyer of Nightingale Associates, in south-east London, suggested putting \u00a33,000 into Julian Hodge Bank's five-year mini-cash Isa paying 5.85% a year over the full term. \"Your cash is tied up for five years, but you can 'cream off' the interest annually - around \u00a3175,\" he says. He also suggests investing \u00a330,000 in a Standard Life With-Profit Bond and recommends withdrawals of 5% payable monthly. Reckoning growth will, in time, exceed 5%, he says this should provide some hedge against inflation and income of around \u00a3125 a month. A further \u00a362.50 a month could be had by investing \u00a315,000 into a Distribution Bond, specifically either Legal &amp; General or AXA Sun Life, giving a total income of around \u00a32,425 a year, with the remaining \u00a32,000 left in a bank for emergencies. 7#149; Janet Swift of Berry Birch &amp; Noble, in Portland Place, London suggests \u00a35,000 for emergencies in Bristol &amp; West's Direct Rate Tracker, paying 5.6% gross; plus the maximum \u00a37,000 Isa allowance into M&amp;G's High Yield Corporate Bond Fund. She would also look at a stakeholder pension, as tax relief would mean putting in only \u00a32,808, while the taxman made it up to the maximum \u00a33,600. The downside is that 75% of the fund must be used to buy an annuity. For the rest, she recommends a combination of with-profits and distribution bonds, suggesting Legal &amp; General's With-Profit Income Bond or Norwich Union's Portfolio Bond, in the former category, and AXA Sun Life or Scottish Amicable in the latter; 5% can be withdrawn annually from both bonds without further tax liability. \u0095 Judith Kirk of Partridge Muir &amp; Warren in Tolworth, Surrey, favours putting two net contributions in a stakeholder pension either side of the end of this tax year. This would immediately enable our client to take \u00a31,800 (25%) of the \u00a37,200 plan back as a tax-free lump sum, while yielding an annual income of around \u00a3295. She also suggests two maxi Isas either side of April 2002: \u00a37,000 into a high yield bond Isa and another \u00a37,000 into a corporate bond Isa, giving a total income of \u00a3910 a year. A further \u00a317,800 could go into an equity income fund, such as Jupiter or Newton Higher Income funds, where dividends are taxed at only 10%, to produce around \u00a3623 a year. And \u00a38,000 could go into an equity growth fund such as Fidelity's Moneybuilder Global or Special Situations to protect against inflation and achieve capital growth for future income generation. The remainder should go into a building society for emergencies. With the rest of the portfolio, this would boost our pensioner's income by just over \u00a32,000 a year. \u0095 Paul Watling of Guildhall Associates in Beckenham, Kent, suggests if our cautious pensioner wants complete safety, she should consider a pension annuity, despite the loss of flexibility and the fact that annuity rates are poor. (Annuity Direct says that a 60-year-old woman with \u00a350,000 could buy a level income for life of \u00a33,619.44 a year guaranteed for five years, on a single life basis). Watling also suggests Guaranteed Income Bonds (GIBs), specifically recommending Pinnacle Insurance whose GIBs are currently paying around 4.6% a year net for terms of one to five years. He also favours with-profits bonds, particularly Standard Life's which have no early encashment fees, but warns against bonds directly linked the stock market that are currently offering high headline rates but could result in loss of capital. Unit trusts can build a potentially increasing income in a tax-efficient way, but in this volatile climate are not suitable for anyone not prepared to take risks. Michael Lockyer: 020 8695 0013.
