Blackpool is one of six new destinations which the no-frills carrier will serve from Stansted Airport from 1 May. It has also decided to reinstate the Stansted-Bergerac route from the same day, which it earlier announced it was scrapping, along with a dozen other Buzz destinations. The other new routes are to Groningen (Holland); Leipzig (Germany); Ostend (Belgium); Palermo (Sicily); and Rodez (France). Tickets are now on sale starting at \u00a329.99 one way including taxes for all destinations apart from Rodez (\u00a339.99 one way) and Palermo (\u00a359.99 one way). Bergerac tickets will go on sale on 12 March. The twice-daily Blackpool route is Ryanair's second within England after it began flying to Newquay last April. It is also starting Dublin-Blackpool flights on 4 April. 'Blackpool is on the map in a big way,' said Michael Cawley, Ryanair's deputy chief executive. He said the Lancashire seaside resort was in a 'lovely area full of golf courses and in striking distance of the Lake District. It will also attract its fair share of stag and hen parties,' he added. Blackpool is better known for its illuminations and seaside attractions, with the Golden Mile stretching from the Blackpool Tower and Central Pier and Europe's tallest and fastest roller coaster. Apart from party political conferences, its most popular events are the World Ballroom Dancing Championships and the January Pigeon Olympiad, when pigeon owners flock to the city to sell their birds - a single egg can go for as much as \u00a35,000. If the government decides later this year to deregulate gambling, Blackpool is also looking to set itself up as the Las Vegas of the North. 'The backbone of our accommodation is still guesthouses,' said head of tourism Jane Seddon. 'But there is a growth of international hotel chains, with names such as Travelodge and Travel Inn. 'People have a stereotypical image of what the resort is like but it has had a renaissance. We are not a typical British seaside resort - we are an entertainment resort.' She said the city now had a large quantity of stylish bars and restaurants, as well as a wealth of Victorian architecture, and lots of West End shows. Previously, getting to Blackpool from London meant a train journey of up to five-and-a-half hours, changing at Preston. Flights will take about an hour, with the airport just a couple of miles from the town centre. Ryanair said it had no further plans to add more destinations from the UK this year. It said it had decided to reinstate Bergerac 'after discussions with the airport took a more positive tune'. It said it now had a long-term agreement and would not drop the desination again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
