Arthritis is a common condition in ageing horses, just as it is in humans, and does not necessarily threaten Istabraq's immediate career. It is treatable with a range of drugs, as well as ultra-violet lamps. However, it is understood that the champion has not had a significant gallop since his winning seasonal debut at Leopardstown in December, and is restricted instead to swimming in Aidan O'Brien's equine pool. Istabraq is a nervous horse and has never been easy to train. The discovery that he has developed arthritis, in addition to worrying signs at Leopardstown that his jumping was losing its fluency, suggests that even if he makes it to Cheltenham in March, it may well be the final race of his career. O'Brien has said that training Classic-winning three- year-olds such as Galileo is easy when set against the pressure of preparing the great hero of Irish racing. Getting the 10-year-old to the post in peak condition at Cheltenham on March 12, with little more than an equine pool for assistance, will be an immense test, even for one of the finest trainers of modern times. Peter Webbon, the Jockey Club's chief veterinary adviser, confirmed yesterday that while arthritis in racehorses is serious it is not inevitably career-threatening. \"All that the word means is an inflamed joint,\" Webbon said. \"Once a horse has got it, it won't go away, but just as people with arthritis can lead normal, active lives, it can be managed in horses by carefully moderating the exercise it takes and using appropriate treatments. \"Swimming is very useful for horses with joint problems. It's obviously more difficult to train a horse with chronic arthritis, but it certainly doesn't necessarily mean the end of the line. It calls on the trainer's skill and the co-operation of his vet to ensure that the horse can race free of discomfort.\" Horses to have won major prizes despite suffering from arthritis include the great race mare Park Top, who won the King George at Ascot in 1969. She developed the condition as a juvenile and often wore copper bracelets on her forelegs when in her box. \"The copper bands that you see on people can also be used on horses, along with magnetic boots and feed supplements,\" Webbon said. \"There are all sorts of things that you can try, but some horses respond better than others.\" O'Brien's Ballydoyle stable would not comment on Istabraq's condition last night. However, the knowledge seeping from his yard that he has developed arthritis may help explain the gelding's steady drift in the ante-post Champion Hurdle betting in the weeks since his winning return at Leopardstown. The best price currently available is 2-1, with the Tote, although that firm reported some interest earlier this week and suggested that they might cut Istabraq's odds for the first time in many months. However, given the considerable problems that O'Brien now seems to face, Istabraq is clearly not a horse to back before the day of the race itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
