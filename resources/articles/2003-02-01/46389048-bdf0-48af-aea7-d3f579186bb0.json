Look at the competition. Soderbergh seems more interested in remaking other people's movies in his own style and in the light of his own obsessions. Quentin Tarantino's career has been on hold for a half-decade now, though we shall soon see if Kill Bill marks any forward progress or just another spiral in the same holding-pattern. Spike Jonze will soon enough have to prove that he can function without the help of gnomic screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. Alexander Payne's mordant comedies often feel more like good middle-class novels than pure movies. And David Fincher, Se7en and Fight Club excepted, has yet to find a subject to suit his ferocious talent for marrying image to sound. Which leaves us with Anderson, whose films fairly fizz and pop with invention; whose camera is a lithe and mobile beast, an all-consuming eyeball; whose choice of music is note-perfect; whose ability to redefine talented, overlooked actors (Burt Reynolds, Philip Baker Hall, John C Reilly) is second to none; and whose faith in the power of emotion is a kick in the pants in this era of faux-irony and insincerity. So yeah, to answer the question, he's the most prodigiously gifted young film-maker in America. No doubt about it. Which brings us to Punch-Drunk Love, Anderson's new movie, starring a surprisingly well-cast Adam Sandler. Unlike its predecessors, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, it's a stripped-down affair: 90 minutes long, with just two major characters. The minimalism of PDL stands in stark and quite deliberate contrast to the, well, the maximalism of its predecessors, which were punch-drunk on their cinematic ecstasy. And the expected complaints have all been heard: he's run out of ideas; he's lost his way; he's got the fourth-movie blues - all that jive. Bullshit. What we actually have here is an artist growing and changing, hungry for new fields to conquer, and making a movie that can, so to speak, cleanse his palate, and reorient his concerns and his film-making practices. Don't give up on the boy just yet; we'll be watching and loving new movies from him 30 years from now. Career high Boogie Nights - which, alongside Fincher's Fight Club, is my candidate for best movie of the 1990s. Career low There really hasn't been one so far, but then again, he is dating Fiona Apple. Need to know Anderson's father Eddie was a TV personality in the 1960s, still fondly remembered in the role of Ghoulardi, a \"ghost-host\" for midnight horror-movie marathons. The last word \"I have a feeling, one of those gut feelings, that I'll make pretty good movies the rest of my life... but I guess the way that I really feel is that Magnolia is, for better or worse, the best movie I'll ever make.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
