The sad thing is, it looked as if he might even have done it on purpose. He hoofed the ball into the stand in disgust, and the whistle blew on a horrible afternoon for Wasps. But where there is misery for Wasps there must by definition be joy for Leicester. This was pretty comprehensive \u2013 a walloping, you might say. Wasps could complain that the try that broke them just after the break, the first of a brace for Lote Tuqiri, should not have stood. And they would be right. Replays showed that Tuqiri dropped the ball has he went to touch down one-handed in the freezing cold. But no one spotted it live, because he had scythed through the Wasps defence so imperiously that the try felt scored before he had touched it down. That the executioner slipped in the last split-second went unnoticed in the general uproar by both the baying mob and the presiding official. In the event of an argument, Leicester and 24,000 of their incandescent fans would counter that the try Wasps scored in the third minute should never have stood, the officials missing what looked like a fairly clear forward pass from Dominic Waldouck in the build-up. Mark van Gisbergen profited, but Cipriani had created the chance with a dashing break. All seemed well with the world of the Wasp, a try to the good in the lair of their arch rivals on what had ended up being a nice sunny afternoon that not even they could claim was unfit for purpose, however cold. Their defence was handling whatever Leicester could throw at them, which was a lot, and they looked sharp when they had the ball. But the lot that Leicester were throwing began to take its toll. Their domination of the set piece was total, and if their heavy runners were punching only dents, not quite holes, in the first half, they were storing up problems for Wasps later in the game. Crane was driven over for what looked a good try with five minutes to go to the break, but the video referee denied it. It was, though, a suspended sentence for Wasps. Until then they had done wonders avoiding the need for a scrum, but now they faced a series of them on their five-metre line, and the carnage was predictable. There was plenty of England candidates for Martin Johnson to mull over here, and surely one of them is Dan Cole, Leicester's 22-year-old tight-head. Last week he was credited with destroying Saracens' scrum (and winding up their director of rugby enough to land him a likely ban); this week he and his mates did the same to Wasps. In the siege that followed, Tim Payne, England's incumbent loose-head, saw yellow. Then when Wasps' seven-man scrum managed to twist and turn in such a way as to satisfy the referee they were not cheating this time, Leicester whipped it wide, Tuqiri came into the line and Johne Murphy scored in the corner to level the scores. Toby Flood converted from the touchline, so that Leicester went into the sheds 10-8 up. Maybe that was the moment Wasps were broken. The second half made ugly viewing for their fans. Tuqiri got away with his try that should not have been, but another huge scrum eight minutes later (with Wasps back to a full complement) had the referee running to the sticks to award Leicester a penalty try. Soon, Simon Shaw was hobbling to the touchline with a knee injury to complete the misery for Wasps, and maybe England, and all that was left was for Leicester to claim their bonus-point try, Tuqiri streaking home after a great little break from another young man surely in Johnson's thoughts, Ben Youngs. Cipriani's body language at the end summed it up for Wasps, who must wish this game had gone the way of all the others this weekend. Leicester, meanwhile, should give their groundstaff a pay rise. No fixture headaches for them later in the season and, for now, they are back at the top of the table with their arch rivals severely chastened and 10 points behind them. It is a lovely game when you are doing all the walloping."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
