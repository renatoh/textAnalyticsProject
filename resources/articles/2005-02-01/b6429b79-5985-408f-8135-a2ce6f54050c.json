Every time, though, just past Ostkreuz just past Ostkreuz, before the Ostbahnhof every time it's the same: the trains, to be blunt, are like long steely cocks - oppressive and trapped in Teutonic clich\u00e9 and they're coming too fast in my face as we race into town and they race away. But that's just digression, resistance, attempts to veil desire in aggression - defence against some hazy threat that the passion inspired by this seven-hour ride, uncontained will burn through the carriage or burn out, profaned with repetitive fantasy sex. Like I said, I digress, derailing all thoughts to a wilderness you, unknowing, tend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
