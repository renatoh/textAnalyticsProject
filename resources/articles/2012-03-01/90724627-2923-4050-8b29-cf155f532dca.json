First the defence coach, Shaun Edwards, waved a red rag at a blue bull by setting the bar higher than for their last clean sweep under Warren Gatland in 2008. Then Matthew Rees, a former captain who could be leading Wales in that final game against France, admitted that Welsh sights are already on the 2015 World Cup. After losing to the 2011 finalists in New Zealand in October, it would seem like adding an unnecessary edge to an already pressurised situation but Edwards said Wales aim to keep the points conceded below the 2008 level of 66 \u2013 which leaves them 17 in hand after keeping Italy scoreless for 68 minutes \u2013 before Rees gave his recipe for ongoing Welsh success. Asked to explain why Gatland is such a successful coach, Rees said: \"He's as honest as the day is long and that's what you want in a coach. You want him to be honest with you right or wrong.\" Earlier Gatland had been flummoxed by the same question. \"I don't like losing too much,\" said the New Zealander. \"When I'm asked what the secret behind being a successful coach is I say: 'You bullshit them for as long as you can until they find what crap you really are'.\" As an attempt to deflect the question, the coach at least got a laugh. Rees was much more direct in his reply, admitting Gatland has been honest with him when a neck injury last summer ended his World Cup hopes. \"Credit to Warren,\" Rees said, \"he gave me a lot of chances to make the World Cup but the neck needed operating on sooner rather than later. \"Bullshit? Gats is his own man and he's got his own ways, but it's working for us. Obviously you have the luxury of the players we have at the moment but it's about kicking on,\" said Rees referring to not only next Saturday but also 2015, when the World Cup is played in Wales as well as England. He made particular reference to Alex Cuthbert, man of the match in only his fifth Test, the 19-year-old George North and the 21-year-old Justin Tipuric, parachuted in for his first Wales start when the World Cup captain, Sam Warburton, was ruled out with a leg injury. \"With guys like Alex and George, they are going to be around for a long time,\" said Rees, who came off the bench for the final-day win over France in 2008 and on Saturday was winning his 49th cap. \"The good thing for us is that no one's position is safe. I don't think we've had that sort of depth in the past. Today was a perfect example. We were without Sam, a quality player but it was good that Justin got his chance. \"The youngsters are coming through and nothing fazes them. They just get out there, do their job and get on with it. They all enjoy their rugby and their training and looking forward to big Test days.\" After Saturday, when Wales failed to make best use of 40 minutes worth of possession compared to Italy's 21 and spent 55 minutes in their opponents' half, Rees admitted that, just back from injury and still short of game time, he is under pressure from his fellow Scarlets hooker Ken Owens. Luke Charteris, one of the second-row stars of the World Cup, is also bucking for a return after injury, while Tipuric had an industrious afternoon and was far from out of place alongside the other back-row scavengers, Dan Lydiate and Toby Faletau. With Scott Williams, the Welsh hero at Twickenham, James Hook, Ryan Jones and Paul James also coming on from the bench, the Rees argument about strength in depth is undeniable, while the 23-year-old Osprey Rhys Webb also got a useful 10 minutes of Test experience, joining the queue of scrum\u2011halves behind Mike Phillips and Lloyd Williams. For Italy another wooden spoon decider against Scotland lies ahead. Under their new coach Jacques Brunel they had a bright start against England, collapsed horribly in Dublin, but battled to the end in Cardiff, keeping their line intact for 49 minutes before Jamie Roberts went 50 metres. Cuthbert then wrapped up a fine afternoon with his try three minutes from time.
