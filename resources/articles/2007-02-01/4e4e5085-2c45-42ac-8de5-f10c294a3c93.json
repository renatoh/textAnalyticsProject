The London blue-chips index closed down 13.8 points, or 0.2%, at 6419.5 following a subdued start in US markets as traders digested comments from Microsoft that analysts' revenue forecasts for the Vista system were \"overly aggressive\". The mood wasn't helped by a downbeat report on US consumer sentiment, with the University of Michigan survey showing an unexpected fall in February following a two-year high for January. The FTSE 100's top losers board featured some of yesterday's top gainers as profit-taking took its toll. Reed Elsevier was one of the biggest fallers. The shares had shot up almost 7% yesterday after the Anglo-Dutch publishing giant said it wanted to sell its education business. Today they closed down 8.5p, or 1.3%, at 636p. Scottish &amp; Newcastle was on the way up yesterday on consolidation talk in the drinks sector but today it was on the way down and lost 11.5p to 567.5p. A pause in the latest copper price rally put some of the big miners under pressure. Antofagasta lost 3.5p to 485p, BHP Billiton slipped 5.5p, or 0.5%, to 1089.5p, while Vedanta Resources was hardest hit, down 18p, or 1.4%, at \u00a312.86, having recently been one of the strongest performing miners on hopes it could get a bid as consolidation spreads through the sector. Anglo American, which reports next week, fell 32p to \u00a325.38 after analysts at Numis cut their recommendation to \"hold\" from \"buy\". Banks and other financial sector stocks hogged much of the limelight among the risers making up for a subdued day on Thursday. Royal Bank of Scotland was up 16p at \u00a321.17, investment managers Amvescap added 9.5p to 632p, Legal &amp; General edged up 1p to 165.5p and Aviva added 4p to 851.5p. In a market short on corporate news, B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher topped the gainers after a price target lift to 290p from 286p by analysts at HSBC. The shares ended up 8.75p, or 3.5%, at 259.75p. Catering group Compass was also in the top 10 climbers list, up 2.75p to 312p after revealing there had been \"significant interest\" in Selecta, the European snacks vending machine business it put up for sale last November. Analysts believe the Selecta sale could bring in as much as \u00a3800m for Compass, which is the world's biggest catering company. It gave no detail on potential buyers today but among the frontrunners is thought to be private equity group Charterhouse Capital Partners, which already owns rival vending business Autobar. Among the midcaps, transport group Go-Ahead was down slightly despite posting a 17% increase in first-half profits and saying it is confident on prospects for the full year. The shares were little moved by the news, down 10p at \u00a323.40, but analysts noted good prospects going forward. \"The interim results highlight another strong trading performance,\" said Investec's Matthew Gerard, who has a \"hold\" recommendation on Go Ahead. \"After a benign share price performance over the three months (relative to the sector), with fuel costs reducing and a projected turnaround in aviation, we believe the shares are starting to look good value.\" Further down the market, troubled iSoft was up 4.75p, or 10.6%, at 49.75p after the Australian health information company IBA Health emerged as a possible rescue bidder for the NHS software supplier. Media group GCap, home to Classic FM and Capital radio, was one of the day's biggest fallers after a major placing. The group's smallcap shares fell 23.75p, or 9.9%, to 217p after UBS placed 13.6m shares. That amounted to 8.3% of the company and market talk was that Morgan Stanley was selling its shares following a 20% rise over the last two months. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. There were some similarly big moves in the food world. Aim-listed cake maker Inter Link Foods slumped 96p, or 28.4%, to 241.5p after it said it will miss market forecasts for the current year. Ready meal and biscuit group Northern Foods also fell, ending down 3.75p, or 2.8% lower, at 131.25p. But back on Aim, cereal bar group Glisten rose as the bad news from the cake-making world whetted traders' appetites for health foods. The shares ended up 8.5p, or 2.1%, to 413.5p. Shares in 2ergo shot to their highest ever level - up 18p at 326.5p- as the text messaging to mobile video services group published plans to demerge its secure mobile communications and payments platform, slapping a value of just under \u00a320m on the business. The Lancashire-based company has been developing the unit under the 2safeguard name but upon demerger on March 6 the Aim-listed firm will be renamed Broca after 19-century French scientist Paul Broca, who carried out pioneering work on the localisation of brain functions and is considered one of the founders of modern neurosurgery. Property group Speymill was on the way up after an upbeat trading statement predicting full-year results \"in line with expectations\". The group, which has invested in property in Macau and Germany, has recently won a contract for a 150-bed safari hotel at Chessington World of Adventure. The shares rose 2p, or 2.5%, to 83p. Ringtone group MonsterMob jumped 10.25p, or 25%, to 51.25p after last night's news of a possible bid from Shanghai-based mobile content group Linktone. MonsterMob's management team responded this morning by saying it would explore the approach in greater detail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
