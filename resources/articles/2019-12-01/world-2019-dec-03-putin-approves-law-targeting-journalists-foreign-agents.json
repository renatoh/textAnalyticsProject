Under the vaguely worded law, Russians and foreigners who work with media or distribute their content and receive money from abroad would be declared foreign agents, potentially exposing journalists, their sources, or even those who share material on social networks to foreign agent status. The move has been described by journalists and human rights activists as a scare tactic to further stem criticism of Putin\u2019s government. In an open letter published last week, more than 60 prominent journalists, writers and activists urged the president not to sign the law. \u201c\u2018Foreign agent\u2019 is a persistent phrase with a sharply negative character,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThe label of foreign agent discredits a person in the eyes of his fellow citizens and disparages his dignity despite the fact that he has done nothing wrong or illegal and did not carry out the will of any foreign employers.\u201d Alexei Venediktov, the editor of the popular Echo of Moscow radio station, said the law was in part prompted by this summer\u2019s protests, the largest in years, sparked by the state\u2019s heavy-handed control over municipal elections. \u201cThis is the story of a selective attack for total fear and to create obstacles for protesters, above all the media, which report on protests, using all available information,\u201d he said in an interview with Znak.com. \u201cThis is yet another tool, it is clear, understood, demonstrated and brazen.\u201d Russia\u2019s register of foreign agent media has 10 entries, all of them outlets tied to either Radio Free Europe or Voice of America, which receive funding from the US. But Russia\u2019s government has also harshly criticised other foreign media for reporting on the demonstrations, including suggesting it could revoke German broadcaster Deutsche Welle\u2019s accreditation for sharing a map of the planned route for an unsanctioned protest in August. Russia\u2019s foreign agent law was developed after large anti-Putin protests in 2012 and has largely targeted NGOs. In November, the country\u2019s supreme court ordered the liquidation of the veteran human rights activist Lev Ponomarev\u2019s For Human Rights NGO, resulting in the organisation being shut down in Russia and removed from the country\u2019s register of legal entities. It was expanded to include media in 2017."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
