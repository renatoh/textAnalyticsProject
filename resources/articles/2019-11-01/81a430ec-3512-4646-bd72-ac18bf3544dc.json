Orange, who led a consortium that took control of the Sharks in 2016 and has invested significant sums in the club, believes more must be done by the sport\u2019s authorities to ensure clubs are protected if wealthy backers decide they want to withdraw their investment. \u201cThe game needs to sort itself out,\u201d he said at a media day at the club\u2019s Carrington training ground on Wednesday. \u201cWe lost \u00a350m last year and that is currently being covered by a load of idiot owners, one of which is me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if those losses become \u00a3100m, and then \u00a3150m and \u00a3200m, there aren\u2019t going to be that many people who either can or want to be able to afford it. Let\u2019s say the average loss is \u00a33.5m per club \u2026 you only need 12 or 13 people to cover that. \u201cIf the losses went to \u00a310m \u2013 which, for instance, if we didn\u2019t have the salary cap it would \u2013 there would be three teams playing each other, wouldn\u2019t there? So we have got to protect it.\u201d Orange believes Premiership Rugby will make changes regarding contracts and the salary cap after Saracens\u2019 record punishment earlier this month. \u201cThey will change some processes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe job now is to make it so onerous to cheat that it\u2019s not worth it. I\u2019m not suggesting anyone has but \u2026 there\u2019s loads of discussions been had, and it\u2019s probably better for me not to be commenting, but we need transparency, players having to account for what they receive. And maybe agents. But Premiership Rugby will do it properly and professionally \u2013 and the new management team are on to it.\u201d When asked if he felt all teams were playing by the same rules, Orange said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I know I have got 24 players and I\u2019m struggling, and others have 48 quality players and aren\u2019t, so I suspect we\u2019re not all the way there yet. But I\u2019m pretty confident we will get there.\u201d Orange said of the prospect of the Premiership abandoning promotion and relegation: \u201cMost peoples\u2019 view is that they think the sport would be better off if we didn\u2019t have it. I see the merits for that, but I have no idea what harm it could do. It could just become duller and duller. My gut feeling is we should keep it \u2026 but I\u2019m not 100% sure.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
