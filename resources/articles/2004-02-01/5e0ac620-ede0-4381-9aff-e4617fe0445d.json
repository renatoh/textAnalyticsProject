Neil, who presents the Daily Politics show on BBC2, will grill three or four hopefuls, likely to include former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind. The interviews will take part in front of an 800-strong audience, testing the potential candidates' media skills in a high-pressure situation. Members of the local Conservative party will vote later that night on who should be put forward at the next election as the Tory candidate for Kensington and Chelsea. \"It's an acknowledgement of the part the media play in our lives,\" said Shireen Ritchie, who chairs the Kensington and Chelsea Conservative Association. \"Every person in public life has to communicate well, particularly a member of parliament. This will be similar to a political interview and will be very helpful for members.\" A camera will record the interviews and display the images on a big screen at the meeting in Kensington Town Hall on February 25. \"It will be as close to a real interview situation as possible,\" said Mrs Ritchie, the stepmother of Madonna's husband, film director Guy Ritchie. Neil was chosen by local Conservatives because he was a \"professional broadcaster who is independent, with no political affiliation\", Mrs Ritchie said. She said it was a \"coincidence\" that Mr Portillo, who has been Kensington and Chelsea's MP since 1999, appears on Neil's BBC1 discussion show This Week. Local party officers and not Mr Portillo, had come up with the idea, she said. Kensington and Chelsea, once the home of acerbic Tory diarist Alan Clark, is one of the safest Conservative seats in the country, and the race to become its new candidate has been one of the most fiercely fought with more 200 hopefuls applying. A shortlist of seven is being narrowed down to just three or four at a party meeting this week. As well as Sir Malcolm, the shortlist includes Times columnist Daniel Finkelstein and Nicholas Hurd, son of the former foreign secretary Douglas Hurd. Neil said it was a \"good idea\" for party members to see how potential MPs would fare against a media inquisitor like himself. \"Politicians have to deal with people like me,\" he said. \"This way party members get a chance to see how their candidates will perform.\" Neil said media skills were essential to politicians in the modern age. \"Maybe Churchill, Gladstone or Disraeli would not have been that great on the Daily Politics, but if you haven't got the skills you will let your constituency down.\" He said he would not be paid for his evening's work, and hoped other parties would follow the Tories' lead if it proved a success. \"There's been no discussion of a fee, and if offered one I would not accept it. I regard this as a public service and would do this for any of the parties.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
