Its 13 songs, however, remain quintessentially Bruce, packed with lost highways, girls in parking lots, lonely towns and abandoned motels, with a cast of drifters, blue-collar heroes and bruised romantics. If the songcraft is often inspired, the arrangements are erratic. Like 1982\u2019s Nebraska on orchestral steroids, the booming strings are too grandiose for austere vignettes of a smashed-up stuntman or an over-the-hill actor reminiscing about \u201cbeing shot by John Wayne\u201d for a drink. A promising cello piece on Chasin\u2019 Wild Horses soon dissolves into a retro Hollywood western score, while the faux Tex-Mex of Sleepy Joe\u2019s Cafe is a misfit. Better are the more subtle touches, augmented by some lovely, plaintive pedal steel, on numbers like Somewhere North of Nashville and Hello Sunshine. Springsteen sings brilliantly throughout, gritty on Hitch Hikin\u2019, Orbison-operatic on the more elaborate pieces, and though the high notes can prove elusive, he retains the cadence of a born narrator. Brave and intriguing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
