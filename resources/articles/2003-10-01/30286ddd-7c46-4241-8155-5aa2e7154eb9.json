Earlier a friend and I had feasted unwisely on \"hopping John\" (rice, peas, salt pork and anything else in the cupboard) with what he - but not I - thought were hilarious results. \"I need the john,\" I said. Fortunately, help was at hand. Lining an entire pavement to one side of the building was a series of portaloos thoughtfully provided by \"John's Johns\". John's john was everything I could have asked for at that moment and I emerged feeling blessed (though not necessarily by God, although this is the derivation of the name \"John\"). I thought of this (you'll not be surprised to learn) while attempting last week's prize puzzle by Biggles in which the theme was buried in the second half of the solution to this clue: \"This mineral's down the toilet (4,4)\". The dictionaries of etymology that I have to hand are non-committal on how \"john\" came to mean toilet. What is apparently known is that it was originally Cousin John. A Harvard residence rule dating from 1735 read, \"No Freshman shall go into the Fellows' Cousin John.\" The dictionaries do list at least 37 other uses for the word: John Doe; john, meaning a prostitute's client; various historical Johns, notably the Baptist; several Popes and a king or two of England, Hungary, Poland, Portugal and France, and so on. Biggles, of course, was written by WE Johns. What I hadn't known was that it came into the English language in various ways. In the semi-precious stone, blue john, for example, \"john\" derives from \"jaune\" and the stone is so-called because the layers of oil deposited in calcium fluoride give it that peculiar blue-yellow colour. Those with longer memories will know this is not the first time Guardian setters have played with the word. It was only last year that Enigmatist came up with \"WC Fields output? (6,6)\"* in a puzzle themed on precisely that. *Answer: TOILET HUMOUR \u00b7 Sandy Balfour is the author of Pretty Girl in Crimson Rose, published by Atlantic Books \ufffd Sandy Balfour 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
