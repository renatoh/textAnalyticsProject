Figures from the official count show that married and civilly partnered couples, for the first time, now make up under half (47%) of all households \u2013 down from 50.9% in 2001. In the decade to 2011, the number of married people stayed constant at 21.2m but the number of single adults rose by more than 3m to 15.7m. In the same period, the number of lone parents rose by 400,000 and the number of people who had been divorced or had a partnership dissolved rose by 600,000. With the census recording 105,000 civil partnerships, a status for gay people which only arrived in 2005, families in Britain appear composed of an ever-broadening mix of relationships, despite the political furore over gay marriage. Most notable has been a dramatic rise in one-person households \u2013 with more than 500,000 created in the decade covered by the census. By contrast the number of households with married or civilly partnered couples dropped by more than 150,000 to 7.5m. There were almost 4m working-age single person households, so-called singletons, in England \u2013 600,000 more than there were married couples with dependent children. The percentage of married people fell by between four and six percentage points in Wales and all England regions except London, where it dropped by two percentage points. In the capital less than a third of people in inner London were married, while in the outer boroughs levels of wedlock were closer to the national average. Large urban centres such as Manchester and Liverpool also had low levels of marriage. In other smaller cities such as Oxford and Exeter, this reluctance to wed might be explained by large student populations. Evidence suggests marriage has become much more selective. This year the leftwing Institute for Public Policy Research warned that \"in the postwar period of rising social mobility, men and women were more likely to marry across class lines than they do today\". The thinktank said the result of people picking a partner similar to themselves is to concentrate \"wealth and poverty\". For other experts the issue was not the makeup of marriages but the lack of them. Samantha Callan, family policy expert at the Centre for Social Justice, warned that \"our social trends are heading in a direction that is contrary to the stability children need to thrive. Evidence from the 2001 census shows only 3% of all couples who are still intact by the time a child is 15 are unmarried.\" She argued that the government should consider recognising that marriage confers benefits \u2013 before the last election the Conservatives planned tax breaks for married couples. \"There are obvious exceptions but marriage tends to be associated with the durable relationships children need to thrive. This is true regardless of social class or education.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
