But there was a warning for Gordon Brown that Labour's resurgence was likely to crumble once the financial situation stabilises. A YouGov poll for the Daily Mirror today shows the government has cut the Tory lead to eight points. The poll puts the Conservatives on 42%, Labour on 34% and the Lib Dems on 14%. Six out of 10 people surveyed backed Brown's handling of the economy. Asked how well he had handled the financial crisis, 16% said \"very well\" and 46% said \"fairly well\". A ComRes survey for the Independent on Sunday showed the Conservative lead over Labour down to nine points. The poll put the Tories on 40%, up one point on last month, Labour on 31%, up four, and the Lib Dems on 16%, down five. In an election this would translate to an 18-seat majority for David Cameron. But despite Labour's improved ratings, just 37% agreed Brown's handling of the banking crisis meant his party had a good chance of winning the next election, while 54% disagreed. A poll for the Mail on Sunday revealed that more than half of voters believed Brown had dealt with the economic crisis well, compared with 35% for Cameron. Were the government to call an emergency general election on the economy, the Tories would score 45%, with Labour on 39%. But when the economic crisis was removed from the equation the Tory rating rose to 46% with Labour falling to 30%. The Liberal Democrats would receive just 13%, the BPIX poll suggested. An ICM poll for the News of the World indicated that 43% of voters, when asked who they trusted more on the economy, backed Brown and the chancellor, Alistair Darling. Cameron and the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, got 35%. But the research also suggested that traditional Labour voters were abandoning the party. Almost a third of working class voters and a quarter of women said they were less likely to vote Labour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
