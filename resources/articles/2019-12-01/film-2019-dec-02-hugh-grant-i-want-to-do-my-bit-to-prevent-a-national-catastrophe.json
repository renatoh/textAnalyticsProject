Speaking before he canvassed in Westminster with Chuka Umunna, who is standing there for the Liberal Democrats, the actor said he had decided his best role in the election was \u201cbanging the drum for tactical voting\u201d. Grant is also due to campaign on behalf of remain-minded Labour candidates, and said his \u201cpersonal fantasy\u201d for the election would be another hung parliament with MPs in charge. Asked if he had considered standing himself, Grant said: \u201cI wanted to help at this election and that was one idea that crossed my mind. But I think I would struggle to follow party orders. I think I might be too old and too pleased with myself to be obedient.\u201d In a brief speech alongside Umunna amid a crowd of Lib Dem activists, Grant said voters should \u201cdo everything we can\u201d to stop a Conservative government. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound dramatic \u2013 even though you could argue that is my job \u2013 but I really think we are facing a national emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that what is left of the Conservative party, once they\u2019ve expelled anyone who was responsible or decent or sane, is something I can contemplate as the government of a country that I love.\u201d Speaking to reporters afterwards, Grant said he feared \u201ca Tory majority who will take us out of the EU and in an almost certainly chaotic fashion\u201d. He said: \u201cBecause like many I give no credence to the argument that one year will be enough to make a new free trade with the EU, and that therefore we will crash out at the end of 2020. And I want to do my modest bit to try and prevent that national catastrophe.\u201d Asked if he was surprised to find himself knocking on doors to canvass for a politician, Grant said: \u201cI did used to sell fire extinguishers door-to-door. I was very good. I also sold coat hanger covers. They\u2019re brilliant. I might go back to that, actually.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
