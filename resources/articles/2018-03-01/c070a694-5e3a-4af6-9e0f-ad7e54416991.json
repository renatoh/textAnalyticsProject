On Saturday the manager oversaw a 2-1 win against Liverpool that stretched their lead in second place over J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team to five points. Yet Mourinho believes the games against Sevilla and Brighton are more important as they are sudden\u2011death contests. United trail Manchester City by 13 points in the league having played one more match, with Pep Guardiola\u2019s side at Stoke City on Monday night. That means the Champions League and FA Cup are the only competitions United can realistically win. Mourinho\u2019s team host Sevilla on Tuesday night in a last-16 second leg, following a goalless draw in the first game. They will be eliminated if the Spanish club manage a scoring draw, while Brighton visit on Saturday for the Cup quarter-final. \u201cSeville and Brighton are more important games than Liverpool,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cLiverpool is Liverpool, it is a big match, it is a match against a direct competition for the top four. But nothing is decided yet. \u201cWe have eight more games and 24 points to play for. But Seville and Brighton are die or live games so the next two are much more important than this one.\u201d The victory against Liverpool follows previous league wins against Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham, yet Mourinho shrugged off their importance. \u201cIt says nothing. In modern football you have to live day by day, week by week and match by match. We have a match in two days and I can imagine that if we lose against Seville on Tuesday everyone will have forgotten what we did in the last couple of weeks. \u201cThat\u2019s modern football \u2013 you have to live in the moment and cope with it. So, yes, we beat Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool \u2013 only City we have not beaten in the current top six \u2013 but that means nothing because in football these days you have to prove it every day.\u201d Marcus Rashford scored United\u2019s goals before Liverpool pulled one back with an Eric Bailly own goal. The 20-year-old Rashford said: \u201cWe can use the confidence of this game to push us through the next games and our focus is on the next game in the Champions League.\u201d Jesse Lingard, a late substitute, also echoed the manager\u2019s sentiment. \u201cOur big week started against Liverpool,\u201d he said. \u201cTo get the result we did shows what kind of team we are and if we can get past Sevilla, it will put us in a good position and then we have the FA Cup. The win puts us in a good position in the league, but we have still got a long way to go so we need to keep pushing.\u201d Lingard praised the attitude of Rashford, who was making a first league start of 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s his mentality \u2013 he has got good people around him,\u201d he added. \u201cThey always assure him he is in a good place at the moment and what kid wouldn\u2019t want to be at United at the moment? He is doing well, he has come in and he has got the right mentality and he has shown the manager what he can do. \u201cIt\u2019s a big club with big players and for players like me and Marcus it\u2019s going to be tough to start every game but once you are on the pitch you have to make an impact and maybe next game you will be playing. But you\u2019ve got to always work hard and he does.\u201d Paul Pogba was unavailable for the Liverpool game after a training ground accident. Mourinho is unsure if he will be fit for the Sevilla game. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThe injury? It was contact with a player in the last minute of the session yesterday. If I finished the session one minute before it wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d Klopp said he was pleased with his side\u2019s reaction after they were 2-0 behind after only 24 minutes. \u201c1-0 down changed the world for us, 2-0 feels really bad so early and after that you can immediately switch off,\u201d the German said. \u201cOf course we are not that far behind in our development. The reaction was as good as you can say after you still lost. I think we would\u2019ve deserved a draw, that\u2019s a fact, but we don\u2019t have it so it\u2019s not important. A draw at Manchester is always a sign of a good game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
