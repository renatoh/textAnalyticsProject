Their manager, Martin O'Neill, virtually said as much after watching West Ham United become the ninth side in the Premier League this season to draw at Villa Park in addition to the three teams who have won there. \"It is now going to be a very difficult task for us,\" O'Neill admitted. \"We really needed to have won today.\" Villa will probably be in Europe again next season though not in the Champions League. The Uefa Cup may be about to metamorphose as the Europa League but it will still be a trundling competition for also-rans. O'Neill more or less opted out of the Uefa Cup this time when he fielded an understrength side that lost to CSKA in Moscow. Having already been eliminated from the FA Cup by Everton, that appeared to clear the decks for a final push toward a Champions League place, but already Villa's legs were going \u2013 with their form not far behind. In early February Villa lay third in the table, seven points ahead of Arsenal. Since then they have taken three points from eight games while Arsenal have gathered 17 from seven. \"Had this result happened in mid- season we could have brushed it aside and made up for it away from home,\" O'Neill reflected on Saturday. Maybe, but the cold truth is that the lack of depth in his squad has been steadily catching up with it. Once an uncomfortable Lucas Neill moved from central midfield to right-back after 32 minutes and Kieron Dyer came into midfield, West Ham's attacking thrust increased Nowhere is this more apparent than in the defence, where the start of Villa's decline can be traced back to the moment Martin Laursen was ruled out long\u2011term with a knee injury. West Ham were exploiting gaps in Villa's defence at the start of this game, when Junior Stanislas was unchallenged as he bore down on Brad Friedel only to see the goalkeeper deflect his shot wide, and again in the closing minutes when Friedel was way off his line challenging for high balls which the centre-backs should have dealt with. In the likely event of Aston Villa failing to make the Champions League, speculation concerning the future of Gareth Barry is bound to be renewed. If Liverpool come calling once more he may now find the chance of playing in the world's best club tournament irresistible. The way Barry got hold of the game on Saturday after West Ham had looked like seizing the initiative said everything about his value to O'Neill and Villa. Going forward Aston Villa showed some of their old zest despite missing the pace of the injured Gabriel Agbonlahor. In John Carew and Emile Heskey they had a powerful front pair who could hold the ball up, whereas the players who do the same for West Ham were all unfit. After 11 minutes a slick passing movement ended with Heskey turning in a low centre from James Milner, and when Heskey intercepted an aberrant pass back from Mark Noble to hit a post just before the half\u2011hour, Villa looked like ending a run of 10 matches without a win. West Ham, however, hung on and drew level five minutes from the end when Diego Trist\u00e1n got his head to a shot from Kieron Dyer which was going wide and deflected it past Friedel. Villa would have had a penalty in stoppage time had a surreptitious handball by James Tomkins been spotted. Maybe they are just not getting the luck of the draw. Man of the match Gareth Barry (Aston Villa) The two claret and blue sides have notably contrasting approaches. Villa focus most of their attacks down the wings whereas West Ham 's neat, precise build-up is reflected by the huge clusters of passes in the middle section of the pitch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
