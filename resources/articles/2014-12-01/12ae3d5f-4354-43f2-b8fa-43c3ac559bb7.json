Often, such projects get no further, and the would-be writer is left with an ongoing feeling of incompletion; a frustration that they were never really heard \u2013 and a growing awareness that the story, from their point of view, will be lost with them. There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you. Maya Angelou, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings Professor G Thomas Couser, author of Memoir: An Introduction, has described memoir writing as the \u2018most democratic province of the republic of letters\u2019 as literally anyone can take part \u2013 and if you can\u2019t write it yourself, you can dictate it to someone else. Memoirs don\u2019t have to achieve large sales to be of value. The mere fact that a story is captured and can hence be returned to in future can bring a huge sense of satisfaction to the author now \u2013 as well as comfort and insight to others later. Whether your legacy to future generations is a love of travel or a specific medical condition, their ability to find out how someone close to them coped with similar circumstances can be really valuable. Memoirs can also have an immense social significance, showing how individuals manage issues that affect many, and certain trends have emerged in the process (eg escape from slavery; treatment for breast cancer). We are primed to use stories. Part of our survival as a species depended upon listening to the stories of our tribal elders as they shared parables and passed down their experience and the wisdom of those who went before. As we get older it is our short-term memory that fades rather than our long-term memory. Perhaps we have evolved like this so that we are able to tell the younger generation about the stories and experiences that have formed us which may be important to subsequent generations if they are to thrive. Philippa Perry, How to Stay Sane In the case of personal memoirs, writing that is emotionally honest and feels authentic will often find a ready audience. Those who have lived through a particular experience, or the period described, may relate to the story of someone else\u2019s navigation. They may find the experience redemptive, and use a memoir written by someone else to reconnect with their own experience \u2013 and perhaps in the process understand what they went through. The jumping-off point, however, may not be as originally intended; the writer cannot control the reader\u2019s response. To take an example from popular culture, \u2018Every Breath You Take\u2019, from The Police\u2019s 1983 album Synchronicity, is interpreted by some as a love song \u2013 indeed, married couples sometimes use it as the choice for their first dance. The lyrics can, however, be interpreted as an expression of obsessive control, and the songwriter Sting has commented: \u2018I think the song is very, very sinister and ugly and people have actually misinterpreted it as being a gentle little love song, when it\u2019s quite the opposite.\u2019 (Interview on BBC2). Of late, supermarket shelves have started to be places where unhappy stories of childhood find a ready market, but memoirs do not have to be of the misery kind to gain followers. There is a growing market for personal stories from all kinds of backgrounds, and the reminiscences of an everyday life, authentically described, can be read with genuine enthusiasm by those interested in the period or circumstances of the characters involved. They may find a depiction of a life a handy place to begin reflecting about what they were/are doing at the same age. Many find the process of memoir writing completely engrossing, and it leads them to a renewed appreciation of the past, and a new respect for family members they had always seen as just \u2018old\u2019. One author commented that she began her own memoir by exploring the story of her grandmother, now in a long-stay geriatric unit, and thereafter wanted to put up a picture above her bed, showing the feisty character she had been in her youth. Indeed, expanding our understanding of the choices faced by previous generations, and the paths they took, can be a considerable development of both their and our own humanity. Others find the process of sorting and throwing away very cathartic. As Hillary Clinton said of physical sorting out in an interview with Chrissy Iley in the Sunday Telegraph, 20 July 2014: \u2018Clearing closets makes my head fitter. I love a project that has a beginning, middle and end \u2026 I love the letting go.\u2019 Writing can feel the same, and the writing of a memoir can bring similar benefits, even to those not directly involved.
