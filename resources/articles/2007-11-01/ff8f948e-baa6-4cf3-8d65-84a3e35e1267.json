A full moon of wild silver: seen on the first night above the cathedral of St Asaph in north Wales and on the second over Wenlock surrounded by a red petrol-sheen halo. These were nights of stinging frost, down to -3C at least, and a moment of sharp breath in a muted grey when movement and sound is etched into darkness. But the pleasure of roaming abroad in the intoxicating moonlight hides dangers. Where the road dives down the Edge between woods I see the bodies of a fallow deer, pheasants and a badger, killed by traffic as they stepped into the open space filled with ghost-light. Slowly, warmer, wetter weather returns and today is wrapped in fog. Perhaps because fog is the opposite of frosty moonlight, there is a similar feeling of weirdness to it. Both fog and moonlight subvert the familiar and resist definition. Moonlight illumines the invisible and concealed - things we have no names for. Fog draws our thoughts into itself, and whatever words we send in to chase after them become lost too. Along a muddy track through trees, the remaining leaves of field maple, elm and sycamore hold a stubborn yellow-ochre glow. The fog is tangible because wet and sounds are muddy. Distant voices, small birds, traffic lose their significance as separate things and are absorbed into the fog. There is no view, nothing to link this place with any other; no evidence of a past, no heritage to constipate this landscape - no \"scape\" to the land. A stone wall, a pole across a gap in a hedge, a jacket rotting in leaves: these have no history; they're just part of a fog that creates its own myths. The only thing that stands out momentarily is a small group of birds flying blind, the sound of their wings like the wail that snipe make called drumming - stiff, eerie wingbeats stir the fog and vanish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
