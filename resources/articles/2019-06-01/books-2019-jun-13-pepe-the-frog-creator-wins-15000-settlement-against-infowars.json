Pepe first appeared as a character in 2005 in Furie\u2019s comic Boy\u2019s Club, in which the \u201cpeaceful frog-dude\u201d and his animal housemates got up to various college hijinks. His image quickly became a meme on MySpace, and later the anonymous message board 4chan, before it was co-opted by the US \u201calt-right\u201d in the early 2010s. Infowars had been selling Pepe\u2019s image on posters when Furie brought the copyright lawsuit against it in order to stop his character\u2019s image being used in forms that he is opposed to, especially for commercial gain. Louis Tompros, Furie\u2019s lawyer, told the Washington Post: \u201cThe goal of this was not really about making money and certainly not about going after Alex Jones \u2026 The goal is to make sure the use of Pepe in association with hateful images and ideas stops, and if anybody thinks they\u2019re going to make any money by selling Pepe hate merchandise, they won\u2019t.\u201d This is not the first battle Furie has fought over the use of Pepe\u2019s image. In 2017, he took legal action against a self-published children\u2019s book featuring the character that his lawyers described as having \u201cracist, Islamophobic and hate-filled themes\u201d. The author was forced to hand over all profits to the Council on American-Islamic Relations. In 2018, Furie succeeded in having images of Pepe removed from the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer, after his lawyers filed multiple takedown requests. He has even launched his own Kickstarter campaign, \u201cSave Pepe\u201d, to fund his legal crusade to rescue his creation from the far right. Though scheduled to go to trial later this month, Furie\u2019s legal team were able to reach the $15,000 settlement out of court, pursuing only the profits Infowars had made from poster sales, as a deterrent to further use of Pepe for commercial purposes. Claiming victory afterwards, Infowars\u2019 lawyer Robert Barnes said that Furie had been after \u201cmillions\u201d \u2013 which was denied by Topros. Furie and his lawyers have stated that they will continue to \u201cenforce his copyrights aggressively to make sure nobody else is profiting off associating Pepe the Frog with hateful imagery.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
