Yet as the tourists built up a formidable lead in the afternoon sunshine this all seemed a very minor consolation. Obviously this little glut of runs was better than another English capitulation and it was mildly reassuring to see the captain digging in before purring to his 16th Test century on a surface that still possesses a few demons. But the destination of the Wisden Trophy has long been decided. This was no time for any triumphalism. Moreover the home attack, already deprived of their captain, Jason Holder, was now threadbare with the promising Keemo Paul damaging a quadriceps in the field early on and Shannon Gabriel having to battle through a variety of strains, which he did valiantly and with very unflattering figures. After the pacemen Roston Chase, who resembled Lance Gibbs in the Barbados Test, now looked no more threatening as an off-spinner than Chevy Chase on vacation somewhere. The West Indian was soon partnered by his captain, Kraigg Brathwaite, another modest off-spinner, and at least one could marvel at the improved over rate if not the urgency of the cricket. An England victory should now ensue but it will be celebrated with no more gusto than a consolation try after an almighty hiding. By the close England\u2019s lead was 448 and Root, Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes had improved ugly tour figures for batsmen of such quality. But is anyone any the wiser? Two cricketers, previously peripheral, have provided food for thought. Mark Wood was sensational on Sunday. If he can reproduce that pace over a longer period of time in the West Indies\u2019 second innings then the England camp will sense real progress and an exciting arrow in their quiver. On Monday, Joe Denly beguiled while compiling his highest Test score \u2013 69. Now at the very least he will be under consideration when the next Test comes around, although a lot can happen in the intervening five months. Denly\u2019s contribution certainly does not mean that England\u2019s early-order woes have been resolved, however. Neither of the openers could prosper on Monday though they did have the added challenge of combating the West Indies attack before it began to wilt. Rory Burns lasted one ball, the first of the day bowled by Paul, which he clipped straight to square-leg, a major opportunity spurned. So after six Tests Burns averages a mere 25, about the same as all his immediate predecessors, yet the impression remains that he is the best bet at the moment. Batting has been tough this winter; he has looked the part, calm and combative, but ultimately it is about runs. Even so it would be a surprise if Burns does not continue as England\u2019s opening batsman in July. The same cannot be said of Keaton Jennings. His timing remained elusive but he battled away for over an hour and his dismissal confirmed that he is out of luck. He tried to flick away a leg-side delivery from Alzarri Joseph; the ball struck the outside of his front leg and somehow, defying the laws of physics, dribbled from there gently on to his stumps. After all his application he did not deserve such ill fortune; nor does he deserve a place in England\u2019s next Test team. After 17 Tests and 32 innings he averages 25.19. He has only ever prospered against spin, an oddity for an opening batsman. Denly was more fluent from the start, of his innings though he had one major slice of luck against Gabriel. On 12 he fended at a short delivery and the ball carried from his glove and bat handle to third slip, where Shimron Hetmeyer dropped a simple catch, an aberration that might allow Denly to continue his Test career. There were some sweet cover drives to follow. Indeed Denly\u2019s fondness for that stroke allied to a calm demeanour at the crease makes him a little reminiscent of one of his recent predecessors \u2013 and future rivals \u2013 James Vince. He was prepared to attack Gabriel when given width. He upper-cut him to good effect with various parts of his bat but on the threshold of a really significant innings this stroke led to his downfall. Another attempted cut shot in what would have been Gabriel\u2019s final over of his spell was edged to the keeper. Meanwhile Root had been bedding in carefully in the knowledge that there would be easier runs on offer later in the day. There was an obvious eagerness to make up for all the recent failures and he was not going to scorn such an opportunity. Buttler was of a similar mind. Between them they had added a hundred when Brathwaite took the second new ball with England on 248 for three. Roach immediately bowled Buttler for 56 with a fine delivery that beat the outside edge. Gabriel came back to bowl another impressively hostile spell but Root calmly made his way towards three figures with some crisp drives off Joseph. Ben Stokes, moreover, provided reassuring company as Root reached his landmark in 189 balls \u2013 he had been prepared to graft when necessary \u2013 and there was more relief at a job well done than jubilation at a memorable innings in his celebration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
