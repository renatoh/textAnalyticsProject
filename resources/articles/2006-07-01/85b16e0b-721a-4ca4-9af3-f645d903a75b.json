It may be the last one I ever buy. This is because one by one the functions that once resided on a hard disk are relocating themselves to the web at a rapid pace. I could, if I wanted to, operate entirely from internet cafes. I am composing these words using Writely, a free word processor - recently bought by Google - that only exists online. There is no complicated program such as Word to be loaded into my computer, and whenever the document is saved (automatically every minute or two), it is done on remote servers around the world and not to my hard disk. It is prudent to keep back-up copies, however. I am also going to shift data from Microsoft's Excel spreadsheets on to Google's free online alternative. For details click \"more\" on Google's main page and then on \"labs\". Most of the research for the article was emailed to my online Google mail account, which I leave open in a separate window on my desktop so I can access it when needed. It has become an alternative to a hard disk for storing text, photo, video and audio files. When I change my computer I won't have to move any data as it will remain on a remote server. I don't use Gmail for what it is intended - sending mail - as it gets cluttered up with all the other data being stored. Instead I use Yahoo and a standard POP3 email service simply because I can't be bothered to contact everyone who has my address. One day all my email will be web based. All the photos you take can now be uploaded from a digital camera to web-only storage sites such as the eerily addictive Flickr.com, with videos going to MyTube or Revver. At the moment, photos still have to be parked temporarily on my hard disk using iPhoto where they act as back-up storage to what is on the web. Soon you will be able to bypass your hard disk and send photos straight to your website from your camera. You already can from cameraphones if you download Shozu's free software. Meanwhile, computer games are migrating from hard disks to consoles and, increasingly, to the web itself. Mass migration to the web is part of a movement geeks call Web 2.0. What is lacking is the availability of a basic web computer, stripped of the need to include dedicated spreadsheets and word processors. For years, entrepreneurs, not least Larry Ellison of Oracle, have been unsuccessfully trying to introduce a \"network computer\" linking directly to the web. So far they have failed, maybe because such ideas were conceived for political reasons - cutting down the power of Microsoft, which accounts for more than 90% of spreadsheets, word processors and PC operating systems - rather than because users wanted them. All that is changing. The web is the easiest place to work from. Web-based computers are being planned in big numbers, initially for the developing world with models such as MIT's sub-$100 (\u00a360) device running on the open source Linux operating system. Where does this leave Microsoft? It is safe for now because its labyrinthine products are so deeply embedded in corporate cultures that it will take years to change. But the Seattle giant's problems with its Vista operating system reveal it as a monopoly that time is passing by. It looks as though the prediction of the late (and greatest) management guru Pete Drucker will be proved right. When asked about Microsoft's monopoly he would quote Thucydides - that hegemony kills itself. A power that has hegemony, he said, always becomes arrogant and always unites the rest of the world against itself. He argued that, as with previous monopolies, such as the Rockefellers, they needed to be broken up, otherwise they would eventually implode. This may well be what is starting to happen to Microsoft now. And web-based devices are more than willing to fill the gap. vic.keegan@theguardian.com \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
