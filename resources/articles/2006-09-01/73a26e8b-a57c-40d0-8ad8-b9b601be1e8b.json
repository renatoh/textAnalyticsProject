Shamshir, who won the Fillies' Mile, and Markofdistinction, in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, were both trained by another Italian, Luca Cumani, and between them, the jockey and trainer have kept the tricolore prominent at the meeting ever since. Now they may have some backup. Marco Botti is not a familiar name to British racegoers yet, but like Dettori before him, he goes to Ascot this weekend with a serious chance to make his reputation on one of the most important afternoons of the Flat racing year. His unbeaten juvenile Sesmen, who was added to the Fillies' Mile at a cost of \u00a320,000 earlier this week, will be his first runner in a Group One contest, and if breeding counts for anything, she will go to the start with every chance. Sesmen's pedigree is the result of meticulous planning by Peter Ebdon, the former world snooker champion, who applies the same driven intensity to the business of breeding thoroughbreds that he does to building breaks. But it is Botti's own family tree that bears the closest inspection, since his name would be as familiar to an Italian racegoer as a Hills or a Dunlop in this country. \"My father [Alduino] and his brother [Giuseppe] train together in Italy,\" Botti says, \"and they have been the champions of the country many, many times. They have won all of the Classics in Italy, and they will be champions again this year for sure, as they have more than 220 winners already.\" Such is the status of the Botti family in Italian racing that Marco, who rode nearly 400 winners during a five-year career as a professional jockey, would have found it easy to start a training career in his native country. Instead, he chose to launch himself as a virtual unknown in the sink-or-swim surroundings of Newmarket. He is becoming more familiar by the week, though, having saddled seven winners from 44 runners so far this season, a strike-rate of 16%. With victories at prices including 33-1, 20-1, 12-1 and 9-1, his level-stake profit is running at \u00a348.25. \"Of course it would have been easier for me to go back to Italy,\" Botti says. \"I don't think that it would have been any problem finding owners there, when in England, all new trainers struggle to find owners and good horses at the beginning. \"But I decided to give it a go here, to take a shot, and I can't complain so far. We have 22 horses here now, and we've had a Group Three winner. Winning a Group Three in England means much more to me than it would in Italy, as it is so much more difficult to win races here.\" The decision to run Sesmen in Saturday's race owes something to Cumani, who employed Botti as a pupil assistant for two years when he first arrived in Britain. He then moved on to spend a year with Ed Dunlop, and six months as head lad with Sheikh Mohammed's collection of blue bloods at Godolphin. \"I was with Luca Cumani when Falbrav had his special season, and his owner also has horses with my father, so I had known him for many years,\" he says. \"He promised to send me a horse when I set up, and luckily, the horse was Sesmen. \"After she won at Goodwood, Luca rang me and said, Marco, you should have a look at the Ascot race and think about supplementing her. It would come at just the right time for her. The owner said that if I was happy with her, it would be worth taking a chance. It is a lot of money, but that's part of the game sometimes. \"We're running against the big yards and the best trainers so it's not going to be easy,\" Botti says. \"But she travels so well and quickens so well, and if everything goes right, we will definitely aim her for the 1,000 Guineas. \"I've worked with Group One horses like Falbrav and Ouija Board in the past, so now I just hope that I've learned enough about how to train them.\" Ron Cox's tip of the day Blue Maeve 3.30 Pontefract A regular at this track, Blue Maeve has three course wins from ten starts, as well as three seconds and a third. He's been in the form of his life this season, scoring on his last two visits and going close off his revised mark in two subsequent runs elsewhere. There seems to be plenty of pace drawn near the rail here and it is to be hoped that Silvestre De Sousa has the sense not to fight for an early lead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
