There is the view of the money men, the chief executives, the guys who have to balance the books and find the money needed to keep a club going. The guys who pay the wages. And then there's the view of the coaches and the players - the guys who have to be totally focused on producing the best team possible. Sometimes they don't sit easily together, although both would probably argue that their goals are the same. This week, though, in the selling of a game, there has been a glitch. For those who don't know, and there can't be many, Wasps are moving the venue of the Heineken Cup game against Leinster on January 17 to Twickenham in the hope of increasing the gate and getting some much-needed funds by expanding the available capacity from about 10,000, which it is at our home in High Wycombe, to 33,000. For a match between the champions of the Guinness Premiership and the Magners League that makes sense and we have done something similar before - last season, against Munster we played at the Ricoh Stadium, doubling the gate. Giving up \"home\" advantage was a risk then as it is now, but our record at Twickenham is pretty tasty and the ground is only just down the road for most of our London-based fans, rather than a drive up the motorway to Coventry. So far so good. But it's the way the news was announced and the way, intentionally or inadvertently, that the game was sold on the back of the \"Cipriani factor\" that is upsetting. I'm prepared to believe our chief executive, Tony Copsey, was attempting to be light-hearted when he said: \"Obviously in the weeks leading up to the game we'll be sending Danny fighting in the clubs and streaking in the streets to give the club some more publicity\" - but it came out wrong and is perpetuating a myth. And it is a myth. The fact is that Danny is a serious and seriously good rugby player. But he is 20 and happens to have a well-known girlfriend, a relationship which is appealing to tabloid newspapers and plays well in a celebrity culture where even a throwaway remark only enhances the distortion that he is something of a good-time Charlie. As I say, the truth is that he is 100% a serious rugby player and a guy who is treated no differently than any other player at Wasps. If he's late for training, he gets his backside kicked. If he plays badly, he gets dropped. He got where he is by serious application. He's dedicated. That horrid injury to his ankle last May didn't mend quickly by accident. Initially it was thought he could be out until the new year, but a combination of work ethic and belief got him back months early and potentially better than before. He's stronger because of the time he spent in the gym and quicker because of the extra sprint coaching he undertook. It's hard to suggest there was a downside to his recovery, but if there is, it's because it only burnished the very visible image of growing rugby celebrity. Even a training-ground bust-up became front-page news, when anyone who knows the game will understand it's in the nature of the sport that tempers do flare - and particularly in training and more so before a big game like the opening round of the Heineken Cup. Now after coming together as a team to beat Castres and ahead of a trip to Dublin for one of the matches of the second pool round, we go and shoot ourselves in the foot when all we want to do is make the game more available to the fans. If 33,000 come to Twickenham in January it may, in part, be because of the \"Danny factor\" but I'll bet that the majority will be there because the team will have \"sold\" itself by playing well against sides like Leinster tomorrow and then Edinburgh (twice) and that qualification for the knockout rounds depends on that January 17 result. That's what I would have preferred to have concentrated on this week. That and two performances last weekend - by Sale in getting a try bonus point in Clermont Ferrand ahead of Sunday's game against the holders, Munster, at Edgeley Park, and by Bath in Toulouse, getting to within 30 seconds of making it a perfect weekend for the English Heineken contingent in France. Both performances were a fantastic advertisement for the Guinness Premiership and didn't go unnoticed across the Channel. Yesterday I had a look at a French website that was running a poll on the most impressive sides after the weekend. By lunch nearly 8,000 had voted, 29% for Sale, 24% for Bath, the same for Stade Fran\u00e7ais and 16% for the newcomers Montauban."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
