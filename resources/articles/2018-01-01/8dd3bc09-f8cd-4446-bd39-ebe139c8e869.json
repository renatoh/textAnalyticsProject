More than \u00a3160,000 has been raised in support of Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, who was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence in 2015 over the death of six-year-old Jack Adcock. The boy, who had Down\u2019s syndrome, died 11 hours after being admitted to hospital following a heart attack brought on by septic shock due to a virulent form of pneumonia. Bawa-Garba was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for two years, and had originally been given a 12-month suspension from practising medicine. However at the high court in London last week, the General Medical Council (GMC) appealed against that decision and called for Bawa-Garba\u2019s \u201cerasure from the medical register\u201d. The decision was welcomed by Adcock\u2019s parents, but it has angered thousands of doctors and supporters who say Bawa-Garba was partly convicted on the basis of evidence used from her own self-appraisal as part of her e-portfolio. More than 1,500 doctors have since signed a letter expressing their \u201cdeep-seated concerns\u201d at their colleague being struck off. In the letter, they argue that the ruling threatens the \u201cculture of openness\u201d that is critical to learning from medical error and would result in others not being honest in their own self-appraisals. The CrowdJustice campaign was set up by the junior doctors Moosa Qureshi, James Haddock and Chris Day, who said they were raising the money so that Bawa-Garba \u201ccan be offered additional independent expert legal advice in respect to challenging the decision that she be permanently erased from the medical register\u201d. They also plan to seek advice about her criminal conviction for gross negligence manslaughter. The doctors said: \u201cDr Bawa-Garba\u2019s case has extraordinary ramifications, with large numbers of doctors recognising that her conviction puts all doctors at risk in the context of a healthcare system which is clearly bearing enormous stress at a national level. \u201cThe case also has implications for patient safety across the UK because healthcare professionals will henceforth be reluctant to share knowledge openly or reflect on clinical errors for fear of criminal prosecution.\u201d In a statement, Bawa-Garba\u2019s former educational supervisor, Jonathan Cusack, said: \u201cThis case is crucial to patient safety and as those supporting Dr Bawa-Garba we would welcome a fully independent legal opinion.\u201d In response to the support Bawa-Garba said she was \u201coverwhelmed with gratitude\u201d and that she plans to employ a top legal team to review the high court\u2019s decision as well as the criminal conviction. In a statement, the GMC\u2019s chief executive, Charlie Massey, defended its decision to push for erasure and said: \u201cWe know the strength of feeling expressed by many doctors working in a system under sustained pressure, and we are totally committed to engendering a speak-up culture in the NHS. \u201cDoctors should never hesitate to act openly and honestly if something has gone wrong.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
