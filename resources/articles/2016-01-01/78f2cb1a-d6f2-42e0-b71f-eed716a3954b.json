The emergency management commissioner, Craig Lapsley, said it would have been \u201criskier not to undertake the backburn\u201d and said it was the fire caused by lightning strike that spread and destroyed homes. \u201cThe operational decision to use fire to control the Wye River-Jamieson track fire was not taken lightly,\u201d Lapsley said on Wednesday evening. \u201cThe decision to burn out unburnt fuels adjacent to the original fire was considered an appropriate strategy after the fire could not be controlled ahead of forecast fire danger days.\u201d Lapsley\u2019s comments were in response to a story in Fairfax Media that said leaked documents from the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning showed the backburning operation, including the use of aerial incendiary balls, was approved despite warnings that it could cause a much larger fire. The original fire, called the Jamieson track fire, was sparked by twin lightning strikes on 19 December. The backburning operation began on 22 December, three days before extreme fire conditions on Christmas Day saw the fire grow to 2,200ha and wipe out a third of Wye River. A report from 23 December said firefighters had \u201cextended the fire out from dense bushland to the Great Ocean Road to make attacking the edge of it easier\u201d before conditions worsened. Lapsley said the backburning operation was conducted to \u201creduce intensity and fire spread\u201d. \u201cBurning out in a forest is a normal method of control, however this was complex and challenging to achieve in such a dry and inaccessible forest,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risks were understood, and it was judged it would be riskier not to undertake the backburn.\u201d Lapsley said the communities were told about the decision to conduct a backburn and it was a factor in putting evacuation plans in place, but said: \u201cThe fire which ran under strong winds on Christmas Day came from the area of the original lightning strike.\u201d The Victorian environment minister, Lisa Neville, told ABC radio on Thursday that she was \u201cdisappointed in the report that was published today\u201d, adding: \u201cThese high-risk strategies have helped control and contain this fire.\u201d A spokeswoman for Neville said the decision to undertake the burn, and every other aspect of the fire, would be reviewed and a report would be produced by the inspector-general for emergency management. \u201cThis was an operational decision made by firefighters who have worked incredibly hard trying to get this fire under control,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThis fire was in deep terrain and could not be extinguished. A decision was made by the incident controller, to conduct a burn-out when conditions were milder and before that every option to control the fire was taken before the burn-out decision was made.\u201d The United Firefighters Union (UFU) and the Institute of Foresters of Australia have both criticised the management of the Wye River fire and called for an independent inquiry. Peter Marshall, secretary of the UFU, said the inquiry was beyond the resources of the inspector-general and should be conducted by the state coroner. The Coroners Act includes powers to investigate fires, even where no death has occurred. \u201cWye River residents are entitled to an independent coronial inquiry,\u201d Marshall said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
