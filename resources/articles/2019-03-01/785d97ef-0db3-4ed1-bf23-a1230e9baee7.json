You know he\u2019ll have the last laugh, don\u2019t you? I don\u2019t know when or how, but he will. He\u2019s just that type of guy. So go ahead, revel in this moment. BT Sport have switched to highlights of the Dortmund-Spurs game, which suggests no interviews are imminent with the participants in this historic match. Would have been interesting to hear what kind of explanation Real\u2019s players could have mustered. \u201cIs it ludicrous to ask as a Chelsea fan if a result like that one tonight for Real Madrid, signalling the end of an era as you say, could sway Eden Hazard to stay?\u201d asks Ciaran Crowther. \u201cI mean you could argue he\u2019s essentially choosing between two basket cases at this point. Real Madrid and Chelsea are two unpredictable and unstable clubs.\u201d It certainly strengthens Hazard\u2019s negotiating position but Real need more than just him. They could go for Kante, too, for a start. As for Real, it\u2019s the end of the line for some of them. Kroos was ineffective, Marcelo didn\u2019t make it off the bench, Ramos was in the stands preparing for a future that will never come, and Bale made very little impact after being introduced as a first-half sub. And Santiago Solari is probably thumbing a lift to the job centre as we speak. Within an excellent collective demonstration, there were some wonderful individual performances: De Jong, De Ligt, Neres and Tadic were all brilliant. Mazraoui, Van de Beek and Ziyech, too.They have unceremoniously ended Real\u2019s era of dominance; it\u2019s just a shame this probably isn\u2019t the dawn of a new n of a new one for Ajax, who will undoubtedly lose some of these players in the summer. But we can enjoy them while they\u2019re together. Someone in the Premier League should take a look at that Tadic bloke. What a glorious day for Ajax! They have come to the Bernebeu and totally outclassed the European champions of 2016, 2017 and 2018! A refreshing team beat a real shower. Hands up who thought Real would accept this without a strop? Nah, Nacho gets himself sent off for pulling down Van de Beek and then squaring up to him. It\u2019s what Ramos would have wanted. 90 min: There will be at least five more minutes, which is generous on Real. There should be at least nine given all the Var carry-on. 88 min: The game is fizzling out. Ajax are conserving themselves for the quarter-final. A bit like Sergio Ramos but without the massive ostrich egg on their face. Real are fading with a whimper. It\u2019s en emphatic end to an era. Real substitution: Valverde on, Casemiro off. The remaining Real fans - a goodly portion have left - boo and whistle and jeer. Warming up for the final whistle, no doubt. So long Solari. 85 min: Tadic latches on to a stray pass at the back by Real. He looks up and plays in a perfect cross from the left, leaving Ziyech with a tap-in .... but he lifts it over the bar from close range! Real spared! Ajax substitution: Veltman on, Mazraou off. 84 min: De Jong gets caught trying to take the mick on the edge of his own box. Modric canters into the area, draws the keeper and rolls the ball to Benzema ... who falls over. Bale tries to convert at the back post but Onana makes a clever save. 82 min: Here is one of the roughly 3,498 emails I\u2019ve received on the theme of: Ramos, Sergio. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this result immensely,\u201d bugles Peter Crosby. \u201cA fine performance from Ajax. I would like to pause a moment once again to consider Sergio Ramos, that Captain of Sh*thousery, that master of the dark arts, and just one of the worst characters to have have graced the modern game. He has been so richly rewarded for that behaviour again and again, but tonight that run has ended in an absolutely perfect way. Thank you Ajax, thank you footballing Gods.\u201d 80 min: Real are broken. There\u2019s no hint of them coming close to scoring the three goals they now need. \u201cThis is getting to be downright humiliating for Real Madrid,\u201d chirps Kari Tuilinius. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly at the point where Ajax start juggling the ball, like the Ajax great Gerrie M\u00fchren did at the Bernab\u00e9u back in 1973.\u201d 77 min: This scoreline does not flatter the Dutch. It accurately reflects the superiority of a deft and dynamic team against a ragged band of names. It\u2019s a real shame that this Ajax side will inevitably be broken up by buyers. But will they, like their forefathers of \u201895, win the Champions League first? It\u2019s a long shot, but after this performance it doesn\u2019t seem so ludicrous. Ajax substitutions: De Wit and Dolberg on, Schone and Neres off Oh my! With everyone expecting a cross, Schone curls a freekick directly into the net from wide on the left. There goes Real\u2019s comeback! It\u2019s an Ajax performance for the ages! Reguilon makes ground down the left and picks out Asensio with a low pass. Asensio steers a low shot into the far corner. The start of a comeback? 69 min: Carvajal pulls the ball back from the byline. Asensio has a go from 10 yards. But an Ajaxa defender makes a block, as they have done every continually. 68 min: The ball runs to Bale 12 yards out. But it\u2019s on his right foot and the his low trickler betrays a man low on confidence. It\u2019s an easy save for Onana. After a delay of four minutes, during which several replays are consulted and each one offers different possible interpretations, the goal stands! The confusion concerned the tackle by Mazraoui on Reguilon by the touchline. He slid in and won the ball brilliantly but some angles suggested the ball had gone out of play, some suggested it did not. The crowd are invited to put the kettle on and chat amongst themselves while the authorities try to figure out what to do. Eventually, the goal is given! Which is just as well, because Tadic\u2019s finish from the edge of the box was superb. Real are in a world of bother! They\u2019re more of a shambles than Var! It\u2019s a beautiful goal but will it stand? 60 min: Ajax\u2019s composure is highly impressive. These young upstarts are making flailing oafs of the three-in0row champs. 59 min: I don\u2019t recall Bale touching the ball in this half. 58 min: Benzema runs in from the left, duping Ziyech with a lovely shimmy-and-go. Then he ignores well placed teammates and tries to curl it into the far post from a difficult angle. He\u2019s done it many times before, in fairness. But this time his shot flies wide 57 min: Real set up camp in the Ajax half. But the visitors are well organised and more dynamic than the hosts and they\u2019re not offering up any easy openings. 55 min: Kroos plays in Reguilon, overlapping down the left. The full-backs stands a cross up to the back post. Benzema does well to get to it but his looping header is easily caught by Onana. 54 min: Blind heads clear a corner by Kroos. 52 min: Much like the first half, Real started brightly but are now being eclipsed by the more effervescent Ajax. 51 min: Tadic receives the ball with his back to a goal at the D of Real\u2019s box. Then he spins and threads a pass through to Van de Beek, who had broke from deep into the left-hand side of the box. The midfield fires low towards the far corner but Courtois saves. 49 min: Asensio, on the right-hand side of the box, goes for a sweet curler into the far corner. It\u2019s a decent try but a yard wide. 48 min: Carvajal makes a burst from the right. But De Jong eventually puts a stop to it. Moments later he does the same to Modric. He\u2019s been a true boss so far. 47 min: Asensio tries to switch play from the right to the left but overhits his attempted pass. Some home fans boo, some offer yelps of encouragement. Real are in a right muddle. 46 min: Ajax set the second half in motion. Is it to be Real\u2019s last Champions League action of the season? Ajax\u2019s players are in the tunnel waiting to go our for the second half with the demeanour of rock stars about to play an encore. \u201cI expect Jose to appear in the dug-out for the second half,\u201d quips Mark Judd. Funnily enough, setpieces have looked like one of Real\u2019s main weapons, but they\u2019re lacking a Marouane Fellaini. Outstanding so far for Ajax: De Jong, De Ligt, Neres, Ziyech and - almost as if Claude Puel got him wrong - Dusan Tadic, who has pulled strings beautifully as false nine type mischief-maker. Real started brightly and Varane headed against the bar early doors. But Ajax took over after that and romped into the lead with two very nifty goals. They could have scored more, too. Bale hit a post a few minutes before half-time but there\u2019s no doubt the visitors deserve to be in front and have, quite frankly, been the better team in the tie so far. The champions are teetering on the brink of elimination. 45 min: Kroos swings over a corner from the right. Nacho heads well wide from 10 yards. 44 min: Super play by Ajax. They\u2019re technically excellent and far more coherent than Real. 43 min: Bale scorches his way down the left, carries on into the box and clips the ball over the advancing goalkeeper .... and hits the post! 42 min: Bale chugs down the left and slips the ball through to Asensio. De Ligt hurls himself in front of the 15-yard shot, making another timely block. 40 min: So far no cameraman has picked out Sergio Ramos in the crowd. Slack work. They\u2019d best rectify that before the end if the scoreline stays the same (or gets worse): the whole world wants to know whether he is, in fact, capable of looking chastened. 38 min: Ziyech delivers an out-swinging corner. De Ligt leaps high to head goalward from 12 yards. A defender blocks it and Real eventually hoof it to safety. 37 min: Bale hoists in a cross from the left. Onana bounds off his line to punch it away ... but misses it entirely! Benzema nods back across the face of goal but Ajax clear. The goalkeeper breathes a mighty sigh of relief. Real substitution: Asensio on, Vinicius off. The teenager suffered an injury. That\u2019s the second enforced substitution from Real. It\u2019s all going bits up for them. 35 min: Real simply can\u2019t cope with Ajax at the back! The visitors are too nimble and too nifty and Real are constantly caught when they try to play their way out from the back. Courtois has just had to tip a shot around the post from Neres to stop Ajax from increasing their lead. 34 min: Ajax are looking comfortable. This has a distinct whiff of 1995 about it. Having said that, the way Ajax are playing, they could yet surpass the 2-0 victory that Litmanen, Davids &amp; Co. sashayed to back then. 32 min: Vinicius charges down the left again and blasts into the sidenetting from a near-impossible angle. 31 min: Neres threatens to embarrass Real again on the counter, so Carvajal gives him a boot to make him stop. That\u2019s the most deserved yellow card you\u2019ll see today, especially as Ramos isn\u2019t on the pitch ... because he got himself suspended to ensure he\u2019d be available for the quarter-final. D\u2019oh! Real substitution: Bale on, Vazquez off. In their hour of need, Real fans cheer the Welshman on to the pitch. Fickle lot, aren\u2019t they? 29 min: Gareth Bale is has warmed up and removed his top. It looks like he\u2019s about to come on to replace Vazquez, who seems to have picked up an injury. Wouldn\u2019t it be a rum thing if, after those boos at the weekend, Bale sprang to Real\u2019s rescue now? \u201cWhy do I get the feeling that Ajax could be 0-4 with 5 mins to go and Madrid would still find a way,\u201d wonders Paul Fitzgerald. 27 min: Vinicius\u2019 speed is troubling Mazroui down the left, so much so that the defender has just got a booking for pulling hi down. He\u2019ll miss the first leg of the quarter-final if Ajax hold on and advance. I say \u2018hold on\u2019, but they\u2019re looking at least as likely as Real to score the next goal. 26 min: With a body feint and a neat turn, De Jong makes fools of two Real players in midfield. He\u2019s endearing himself more to Barcelona fans every time he gets possession. 24 min: Onano makes a save from Benzema after a strong break down the left by Vinicius. Varane commits a foul from the ensuing corner. 22 min: After a botched Real corner, Ajax launch forward. Tadic produces another fine pass, bisecting the very exposed Real defence. Suddenly Neres is bearing down on goal! He tries to lob the out-rushing Courtois from 15 yards, but his shot drops a couple of yards wide. What a lovely goal! And what a sensation we have in the making here! Tadic did superbly in the build-up, holding off one opponents before pirouetting past Casemiro and nudging a perfect pass through to Neres, who sidesteps the advancing Courtois and clips the ball into the empty net! The three-in-a-row European champions are on the ropes! 16 min: Benzema tries to slip a pass through to Vinicius as Real break. The teenager\u2019s control is sloppy but he\u2019s fortunate that the ball ricochets out of De Ligt for a corner. 14 min: Patient play by Real culminates with a deliciously subtle tee-up by Modric for Kroos, whose 20-yard shot is an affront to what went before it. Way, way wide. 12 min: Two outrageous pieces of skill - first by De Jong and then by Neres- elicit gasps of admiration from the home fans (and possibly of envy, given that De Jong is on his way to Barcelona). But Neres then overruns the ball on the left. Lucky for Carvajal, who was flummoxed by the winger\u2019s trickery. 9 min: The home crowd are staying with their team for the moment. And their try to repay them with a lovely intricate move. It takes a wonderful tackle by De Ligt near the penalty spot to prevent Vazquez from getting off a shot. 7 min: The goal originated in loose play on the let by Real. Tadic nicked the ball and dashed forward before teeing up Ziyech, who guided a low first-time left-footed shot into the bottom corner. The Champions League holders are in deep trouble even if they\u2019re still in front thanks to their two away goals. There goes Real\u2019s fine plans to settle their nerves! Ajax have the early goal thanks to a marvellous composed finish by Ziyech following sloppiness by Real! 5 min: Ajax try to build their way forward but Real\u2019s tenacity in midfield is exemplified by Modric, who harries Sch\u00f6ne into losing possession near the centre circle. 4 min: A brilliant cross from wide on the right by Vazquez. Varane, who had stayed forward after Real\u2019s corner was cleared, is free at the back post! He sends a powerful header from six yards ... against the crossbar! 4 min: Benzema does well to win a corner on the left and gestures at the crowd to crank the volume up even higher. Real are deadset on nabbing an early goal here. 3 min: Real have made a commending start, very much on the front foot. But Ajax have kept them at bay so far. 2 min: Benzema collects a throw-in on the right wing and tries to barrel his way into the box, but De Jong does well to get his body between the Frenchman and the ball before clearing. 1 min: We have kickoff. Real do the honours. The last time Real Madrid fell at this stage of the competition was in 2010, when they lost 2-1 on aggregate to Lyon. The year before that they were turfed out 5-0 by Liverpool. Since then, though, they\u2019ve always reached at least the semi-final and have been in four of the last five finals, winning the last three. So what Ajax are trying to do today is not just overturn a deficit but terminate an era. The teams are limbering up on the pitch Ajax, whose fans are making a terrific racket, are wearing black and gold away shirts. Real are dressed as you knew they would be. Ajax go with the same that started in the first leg, while Real make two alterations, and not only because of Sergio Ramos\u2019s invited suspension. Ramos is replaced by Varane. In the other change, Lucas Vazques starts. which means Bale is back on the bench. Let\u2019s see how he\u2019s welcomed if he gets on. Real: Courtois; Carvajal, Nacho, Varane, Reguilon; Kroos, Casemiro, Modric; Lucas Vazquez, Benzema, Vinicius Subs: Navas, Vallejo, Bale, Marcelo, Valverde, Asensio, Ceballos Ajax: Onana; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Blind, Tagliafico; Sch\u00f6ne, Van de Beek, De Jong; Ziyech, Tadic, Neres Subs: Varela, Veltman, Sinkgraven, Huntelaar, Labyad, Dolbert, De Wit Ref: F Brych (Ger) A team that won 2-1 in the away leg should have a glide in their stride going into the return match, but Real are a-wobblin\u2019. They know they were a trifle jammy to make it out of Amsterdam with a win in the first leg match and they\u2019ve lost three of their four games since then while being dumped out of their domestic cup and effectively out of the Spanish title race, too. They\u2019re struggling to score freely and their fans are lobbing scorn at their players, even the ones that seldom play, most particularly Gareth Bale. So they\u2019re a club under serious pressure. If Ajax, who outplayed them for stretches in the first leg, were to land an early blow on their hosts today, then we know how the Bernebeu not-so-faithful would react; but how would Real\u2019s players respond? That\u2019s what the neutrals among us would like to find out. So come on, Ajax! (OK, that didn\u2019t sound very neutral). The prospect of the winners of the last three Champions Leagues (and semi-finalists in each of the last eight seasons) being eliminated at the last 16 stage would surely inspire a spectacular fightback or a monumental collapse. So come on, Ajax, land that early blow! But are Ajax really good enough to do that? Well they\u2019ve been scoring with abandon since the first leg, plundering 13 goals in three matches, albeit not against the likes of Barcelona (but a 3-0 win at Feyenoord will never be sniffed at by Ajax fans). And they\u2019ve got some of the most exciting young talents in Europe, from goalkeeper Andre Onana and defender Mathias De Light to midfielder Frankie de Jong (who\u2019ll join Barcelona in the summer) and the 25-year-old forward Hakim Ziyech. That might not make them quite as gifted as the Ajax team who put on an unforgettable demonstration on this ground in 1995 but, given Real\u2019s current woes, another 2-0 away win is not out of the question, though it is unlikely. Let\u2019s be having you!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
