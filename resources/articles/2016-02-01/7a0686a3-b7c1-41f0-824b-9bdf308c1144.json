But he avoided a meeting with the missing students\u2019 families, instead overseeing a military ceremony on Wednesday to celebrate the national flag. At the ceremony in Iguala \u2013 known as the birthplace of the Mexican tricolour \u2013 Pe\u00f1a Nieto made only brief references to the disappearance and probable massacre of the students on the night of 26 September 2014, an incident which fuelled large street protests against impunity and official corruption. Flanked by senior military officers \u2013 including the head of the army, Gen Salvador Cienfuegos, who has refused to allow investigators to question soldiers over allegations they were involved in the attacks \u2013 Pe\u00f1a Nieto called for Mexicans to put their faith in the country\u2019s embattled institutions. \u201cThroughout our national history, Mexicans have confirmed time and again that the best route to the future is the road of laws and institutions,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto said in a message apparently aimed at quelling criticism despite a looming currency crisis, slowing economic growth and simmering discontent over violent crime and corruption. \u201cThe regrettable events occurring here in Iguala, in September 2014, provided evidence of the need to continue advancing on this route.\u201d The trip to Iguala came more than 500 days after the attacks on the students, a period in which Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s aloof response to the tragedy has generated widespread anger and sent his popularity plummeting. The visit also comes as outside experts continue to question the findings of an official investigation \u2013 described in early 2015 as \u201cthe historic truth\u201d by thenattorney general Jes\u00fas Murillo Karam. Two independent reviews of the investigation \u2013 by experts from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and the Argentine Forensic Anthropologists team \u2013 have rejected the government\u2019s insistence that the students\u2019 bodies were burned in a rubbish dump before their ashes were tossed into a nearby river. On Sunday, IACHR investigators complained that their work had been obstructed by government and military officials who had limited their access to documents concerning the case and prevented them from questioning troops at an army base in Iguala. Families of the 43 students insist still that their sons are still alive, express misgivings about the army and accuse the federal government of giving the investigation short shrift. \u201cPe\u00f1a Nieto didn\u2019t come [to Iguala] because of us,\u201d said Emiliano Navarrete, whose son attended the Ayotzinapa normal school and is among the missing. \u201cThey have all the people and resources to find out what happened, but they invented a lie.\u201d Human rights groups expressed similar frustrations with the belated presidential visit, which appeared to be motivated by reasons related more to the military than the investigation. \u201cWe regret that his first visit to the place that has come to represent the human rights crisis in this country comes in the context of a civic-military celebration,\u201d said Santiago Aguirre, deputy director of the Miguel Agust\u00edn Pro Ju\u00e1rez Human Rights Centre, which has worked with the Ayotzinapa families. Pe\u00f1a Nieto initially stayed silent after the Iguala attacks and waited weeks to travel to Guerrero state, though he eventually headed to Acapulco \u2013 down the highway from Iguala \u2013 to say Mexicans were \u201covercoming\u201d the tragedy. Since the attacks on the students, however, violence in Guerrero state, which includes Iguala, has only intensified. Speaking on Wednesday, Pe\u00f1a Nieto defended the investigation, and said that Iguala should not be stigmatised by the attacks. \u201cFor one year and five months, the Mexican government has deployed an enormous institutional effort to pursue justice, starting with a profound, transparent and open investigation,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto said. \u201c[Iguala] must not be marked by these tragic events. Its people deserve to be known for their strengths, warmth and firm character to achieve things in favour of their community.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
