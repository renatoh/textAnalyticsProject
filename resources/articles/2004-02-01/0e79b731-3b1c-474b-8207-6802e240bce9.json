The Maldives came in top of all Kuoni's destinations in 2003, the first time in the company's 37-year history that a Far East country has not been in the number one slot. Although this was partly due to the impact of Sars and security issues on Asian tourism, Kuoni said it was also a reflection of the Maldives' stunning beaches, ever-improving hotels, great spas and the perception that it was 'out of harm's way'. Kuoni's special services manager Phil Boswell added: 'They have indicated to us that from April this year, you can get married there. They will be civil weddings done by registrars.' Kuoni has been trying to get the Muslim Maldives to agree to weddings for the last 15 years. So far, it has only been possible to renew a couple's vows there. The growing weddings and honeymoon market accounts for almost a quarter of Kuoni's business, with Sri Lanka the favourite wedding destination and Maldives top for honeymoons. Many people currently combine the two in a twin-centre holiday. 'It will be interesting to see how much impact that [the Maldives decision] has on Sri Lanka,' said Kuoni managing director Sue Biggs. She said Indian Ocean destinations in general had had a bumper year in 2003, with Mauritius up 22 per cent and Sri Lanka achieving nearly 30 per cent growth among Kuoni clients. However, she warned that price increases as a result of increased popularity could drive holidaymakers away this year, especially considering there was a pent-up demand for the Far East. Other destinations tipped to enjoy a boom 2004 are the US, particularly Florida and New York, India, and Arab nations including Egypt, Dubai and Morocco. Kuoni is also expecting an increase in off-the-beaten-track destinations such as Zambia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Nepal, more demand for luxury and spa holidays and an increasing number of people wanting to hold special events such as fortieth birthday parties abroad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
