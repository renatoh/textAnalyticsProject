Scientists from the University of New South Wales have used a new paper to argue for the translocation of the species from its current habitat in the alpine regions of Victoria and New South Wales into lowland rainforests. While lowland rainforest would be a new environment for the current species (Burramys parvus), the researchers say fossil records dating back 25m years show other species in the Burramys lineage always occupied these areas. The paper identifies fossil records found in what is now the Tirari Desert in South Australia, the savannah woodlands of Queensland\u2019s Riversleigh world heritage area, and the savannah grasslands of Hamilton, Victoria. The paper\u2019s lead author, Mike Archer, a palaeontologist and professor of biological, earth and environmental sciences, said these previous populations thrived in these areas at a time when they were lowland rainforest communities. \u201cUntil we started doing our fossil work, most people have had no real idea of the history of this endearing animal,\u201d Archer said. \u201cThe environment it\u2019s surviving in now is going to collapse underneath them and the expectation from scientists has been they\u2019ll go extinct due to climate change. \u201cThe fossil record is saying that a new approach may save these animals.\u201d The mountain pygmy possum is a critically endangered marsupial that hibernates for five to seven months of the year. Just 2,000 of them remain in the wild. Recent crashes in Australia\u2019s bogong moth population, an important food source for the possum, have put pressure on the animal. Last year, scientists monitoring the mountain pygmy possum late in the breeding season in Victoria found that between 50% and 95% of the animals had lost their full litters of young. Analysis found the animals had starved to death without their main food source. In the new paper, the UNSW researchers use the fossil records to suggest the current species may be living at the extreme of its habitat.

Archer said the team of scientists had raised $150,000 in start-up funds toward the construction of a breeding facility at Secret Creek Sanctuary in Lithgow. They would require more funding to build the facility, as well as government approvals to establish any kind of captive breeding program. But Hayley Bates, a lecturer in zoology and conservation biology at UNSW and a co-author on the study, said the proposed site had some similarities with the type of environment the researchers were looking for. She said the proposal was to breed possums from the NSW mountain pygmy possum population and, once numbers were high enough, study them under different climatic conditions and strategically release them to see if they survive. \u201cIf that\u2019s successful we would look at potentially translocating them to lower down,\u201d Bates said. She said if it works they could consider whether similar approaches could be applied to other species. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can learn from understanding a species\u2019 evolutionary history that ultimately allows it to survive in its habitat now,\u201d Bates said. \u201cIt also gives us a lot of information about how a species might adapt to changing environments.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
