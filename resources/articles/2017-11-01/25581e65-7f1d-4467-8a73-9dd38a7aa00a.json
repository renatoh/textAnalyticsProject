Rarely have they ever had a sharper back three than the trio facing Australia on Saturday, with Mike Brown\u2019s concussion having offered Jonny May, Anthony Watson and Elliot Daly the chance of a collective gallop at Twickenham. Not since Delon Armitage, Paul Sackey and Ugo Monye played in a comfortable England win against the Pacific Islanders in autumn 2008, with a youthful Danny Cipriani at fly-half, has there arguably been anything as swift. Before that \u2013 and with no offence to the World Cup winners Josh Lewsey and Jason Robinson \u2013 it is probably necessary to go back to 2001 when Iain Balshaw, in company with Dan Luger and Ben Cohen, showed Wales a clean pair of heels in a 44-15 win in Cardiff. Assuming England obtain enough ball, there must be a chance of fireworks after the damp squib against Argentina last week. With the distinctly rapid Semesa Rokoduguni on the bench alongside Danny Care and the fleet-footed Sam Simmonds, there is certainly the potential for several fresh jolts of electricity. Clearly that has to be allied to gainline power but Eddie Jones is among those excited by the possibilities. \u201cWatson\u2019s like a Maserati, mate, he flies. He\u2019s an absolute flyer,\u201d the England head coach said. \u201cI thought he was one of the best players on the Lions tour. We\u2019re disappointed Mike\u2019s not playing but it\u2019s a great opportunity for Anthony. Jonny\u2019s strong, he\u2019s fast and he\u2019ll be the fastest winger on the field. Any opportunities he gets, he\u2019ll turn into points for us.\u201d In addition to May\u2019s striking domestic form for Leicester \u2013 he has scored 10 tries in his first nine games for the club \u2013 Australia may also be concerned to discover the winger has just broken his own personal best for flat-out sprinting since returning from the tweaked hamstring which ruled him out of contention for the Pumas game. The 27-year-old was timed at 10.49 metres per second on the grass of Twickenham last Saturday morning, a result which took even him by surprise. \u201cIt was a 40- or 50-metre sprint, a rehab run. I was shocked,\u201d May said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would go anywhere that fast. I knew I had to run flat out to test it and was pretty nervous but it was fine. Everyone is getting stronger and faster and that\u2019s the approach I\u2019ve wanted to take [since] I blew my knee out in January 2016. When your speed gets taken away from you, it makes you hungrier than ever to get quicker.\u201d Given May was hardly slow beforehand \u2013 his scintillating try against New Zealand three years ago was certainly a classic of the genre \u2013 it is a timely example of why England\u2019s captain, Dylan Hartley, believes May\u2019s thirst for improvement is good for the entire squad. \u201cJonny\u2019s fast, real fast,\u201d Hartley said. \u201cThe way he prepares is unbelievable, he\u2019s a 24/7 athlete. Everything he does is to make sure he\u2019s the fastest winger in the world. Other players see that and think: \u2018If he\u2019s like that then I need to be.\u2019 It rubs off on people.\u201d Hartley also rates Daly\u2019s mental alertness \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s sharp up there, too\u201d \u2013 but the absence of Brown will be a culture shock given the Harlequin has started 20 of the 21 Tests since Jones became England\u2019s head coach. \u201cIt\u2019s the first game any of us have played without him at full-back, barring one or two games,\u201d May said. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting back three but we\u2019ll miss Brownie. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back next week but it gives us an opportunity for Anthony to have a go at full-back and that excites us as well.\u201d On this occasion May will switch to the right wing, with Daly on the left, although the former is not hugely bothered by the move. \u201cI\u2019ve played on the left wing mainly because I preferred the number 11 to 14. I just prefer odd numbers to even ones. It makes complete sense for Elliot to be on the left wing because he\u2019s left\u2011footed. We have spoken about Australia\u2019s kicking game and we want to put pressure on that. Hopefully we will get some good opportunities to run the ball back at them.\u201d The return of Owen Farrell relegates Henry Slade to the bench, with Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes paired in the second row and Maro Itoje also among the replacements. Itoje is eager to feature but Jones is determined not to over-play his Lions contingent. \u201cThe number of players who have suffered long-term injuries from the Lions tour is significant. Maro and Owen are now approaching their best [but] the others are miles away from their best. \u201cThis is going to be a difficult period of time for us and we have to mix and match. We\u2019ll need to take other players out at certain times to recondition them because we\u2019re moving towards the World Cup. We need players to be fit. If we get long-term injuries in 2018 it affects our ability to play in the World Cup. We\u2019re getting close to that.\u201d England (v Australia) A Watson (Bath); J May (Leicester), J Joseph (Bath), O Farrell (Saracens), E Daly (Wasps); G Ford (Leicester), B Youngs (Leicester); M Vunipola (Saracens), D Hartley (Northampton, capt), D Cole (Leicester), J Launchbury (Wasps), C Lawes (Northampton), C Robshaw (Harlequins), S Underhill (Bath), N Hughes (Wasps).
