It\u2019s a small moment of schadenfreude for anyone who has lost tickets or money to a scalper \u2013 but since that episode aired in 1992, the problem has got much, much worse. Last week in Australia Jerry Seinfeld unwittingly exposed how vulnerable fans are in a lightly regulated ticketing system that rips them off. After a two-day presale for Telstra customers, ticket sales to Seinfeld\u2019s first Australian standup tour in close to 20 years opened to the public through Ticketek, with the cheapest tickets in Sydney priced at $81.40 and premium seats costing $203.60. Within minutes they were sold out. And within hours they were reselling on Australian resale sites including ViaGogo, Ticketblaster and Ticketmaster Resale, with some sellers on Ticketmaster Resale asking $2,298.85 for a ticket. The same is true for Adelaide and Melbourne. For the first show, in Perth, there was a pair on sale for $2,300, just to keep it simple; for Brisbane you could find them for $1,998.96. \u201c[Scalping] is generally seen as a really dishonest thing to do,\u201d wrote one angry Facebook commenter. \u201cIt seems your Ticketmaster Resale website is a platform for this.\u201d A self-described \u201chuge Seinfeld fan\u201d, the television critic and podcaster Dan Barrett missed out on Sydney tickets to Seinfeld and will have to fly to Brisbane to see the show. \u201cIt\u2019s offensive to see large ticketing websites facilitating the scalping of tickets,\u201d he said of the inflated costs available through resale sites. \u201cIt only encourages profiteering, leaving fans like myself unable to go.\u201d A Ticketek spokesman echoed the criticism in a statement to Guardian Australia, urging fans to \u201cavoid resale scalper websites\u201d, calling them \u201cpredatory and misleading\u201d. \u201cThere is no guarantee those tickets are genuine and you risk being ripped off. We see countless examples of people who buy from resale and never receive tickets or find that they are the third or fourth buyer of the same ticket. Fans should only purchase tickets from the official ticketing agent.\u201d Ticketek v Ticketmaster Some fans believe Ticketek exacerbated the Seinfeld frenzy by releasing some tickets to Telstra customers early under its commercial partnership \u2013 standard practice for many events, but one that reduced an already small pool of tickets available to the wider public on Monday. Customers and ticket sellers are also vulnerable to \u201cbots\u201d that buy tickets in high volume at high speed then flip them on to reselling sites \u2013 often before a concert, musical or sporting event has even sold out. A Ticketek spokesman said bot activity \u201cwasn\u2019t a significant factor\u201d in the Seinfeld tour, which was more about \u201ca huge demand and a limited number of tour dates and available tickets\u201d. But, he said, Ticketek was \u201calways vigilant\u201d about bots and had invested \u201cconsiderable technical effort and funds\u201d to defend against them. But others are pointing the finger at Ticketmaster, Ticketek\u2019s rival ticketing agent, which appears to be selling Seinfeld tickets for the greatest markups through its reselling arm, Ticketmaster Resale, and making a small fortune from the scalped tickets. Live Nation Entertainment group is the global parent company of Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster Resale and the promotions and touring company Live Nation. In its annual report, its chief executive, Michael Rapino, trumpeted the company\u2019s reselling platforms as a \u201cmajor focus\u201d now in operation in 13 countries. Reselling for Live Nation Entertainment enjoyed 34% growth in gross transaction value last year, amounting to US$1.2bn \u2013 and continuing to \u201cgrow the volume of secondary tickets sold\u201d forms part of the company\u2019s strategy. While Ticketmaster Resale has not released the amount of revenue it is taking from the $1.2bn in transactions, it\u2019s likely to be a lot. Speaking to Guardian Australia, a Ticketmaster spokeswoman said every transaction incurred a 15% fee from the buyer and a 10% fee from the seller \u2013 meaning Ticketmaster Resale makes 25% on each transaction. With Ticketmaster Resale taking at least 25% on each transaction, the higher the inflation charged by the seller, the higher its profit. In the extreme example of a $2,300 Seinfeld ticket, it means the company would accrue at least $575 for merely handling the deal. In the case of the Live Nation tours that are sold through Ticketmaster and resold through Ticketmaster Resale, Live Nation Entertainment is not only profiting from scalpers\u2019 inflated prices but effectively double dipping, making money on the primary sale and all secondary sale fees and charges. Responding to this claim, Live Nation sent a statement: \u201cLive Nation Australia [the Australian branch of the global company] does not participate in any revenues or fees that may be generated through the Ticketmaster Resale program.\u201d Ticketmaster refused to comment on this. This week will represent another highlight in the scalpers\u2019 calendar, when tickets for Adele\u2019s first Australian shows go on sale. Promoters believe this sale will outstrip the nearest comparison: AC/DC\u2019s tour last year. But Adele \u2013 along with acts such as Iron Maiden, Mumford and Sons and Violent Soho \u2013 has been one of those waging a war against scalping, which puts money in the pocket of scalpers \u2013 not artists \u2013 at the expense of an artist\u2019s fans. Who is the touring company for Adele? Live Nation. And the official ticket agent for Adele\u2019s shows in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth? Ticketmaster. Perhaps that\u2019s why Ticketmaster has confirmed to Guardian Australia that Adele tickets will not be listed on Ticketmaster Resale. Live Nation works for its artists, after all. Ticketek is handling the sales for the Sydney and Adelaide shows. Like other ticket resale companies around the country, Ticketmaster Resale stresses that its platform is \u201csecure\u201d: \u201cWe verify and reissue every ticket sold by fans \u2026 The seat you buy is always the seat you get,\u201d it says on its website. \u201cTicketmaster Resale provides a safe and secure platform for fans to sell unwanted tickets and to purchase tickets for events that might otherwise be sold out,\u201d Ticketmaster said in a statement to Guardian Australia. \u201cOur Ticketmaster Resale marketplace offers the best solution for fans, as it provides a customer guarantee which protects fans when making a purchase.\u201d Appetite for destruction Ticketmaster Resale is a major player in the Australian secondary ticket industry, with ViaGogo, Queen of Tickets and Ticketblaster among a bunch of other resale platforms dealing in tickets to sporting and cultural events. Some resales, of course, are genuine: sellers may no longer be able to go to an event, and it\u2019s not illegal for them to sell tickets on to buyers who can. But in reality these resale marketplaces are facilitating, and often profiting from, ticket scalping \u2013 and the fans are losing out. Tickets for Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 2017 tour are now going for $2,300 on Ticketmaster Resale; Justin Bieber is listed on ViaGogo for $1474. One Nick Cave fan searched for tickets to the artist\u2019s upcoming Australian tour and landed on ViaGogo\u2019s site before the primary ticketseller\u2019s homepage \u2013 thanks to some well-placed Google AdWords. In a rush, he spent $350 on two tickets, well above the general seating cost of $103 each, before receiving an itemised bill: he would pay a service charge of $54 per ticket, amounting to $458 in total. He received no confirmation of where he would be seated. Not only are users paying a premium price and a substantial fee for their ticket, but they are not even guaranteed entry. Many venues refuse resold tickets; many of the tickets sold aren\u2019t legitimate; some ticket numbers are sold more than once; and some tickets \u2013 listed at a premium price in the vague \u201csection A\u201d \u2013 end up not only being the worst seats in section A, but among the worst in the house. Like other resellers, Ticketmaster Resale guarantees a 100% refund of the ticket price if the ticket is not accepted by the venue or promoter \u2013 but, also like other resellers, the company pockets the fees regardless. The law What can be done? Australia\u2019s federal consumer laws protect customers against misleading or deceptive conduct \u2013 but the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says selling tickets at inflated pricing is in itself not in breach of federal laws. Some forms of scalping are illegal in some states and at particular venues \u2013 but according to a report on scalping introduced to parliament by Senator Nick Xenophon in 2014, the state-based legislation is complicated, inconsistent and ineffective. \u201cWe hate it \u2026 we\u2019re against it,\u201d the music industry heavyweight Michael Gudinski told the Herald Sun. \u201cSome of the prices I\u2019ve seen are extreme, and it doesn\u2019t go to the artists or the promoters. It\u2019s a great frustration and I think the ACCC should look at it.\u201d Live Performance Australia is the peak body for the nation\u2019s live performance industry, and its chief executive, Evelyn Richardson, said the secondary ticket market was a key issue right now. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it as we speak,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. In Australia, solutions are likely to include a mix of self-regulation within the industry, and better government regulation of technological developments such as automated software and bots. In September Xenophon revived his fight to get the federal government to legislate against these bots \u2013 a fight Ticketek endorses. \u201cWe are also watching closely the situation in the US and the UK, where there are advanced plans to criminalise the use of bots to acquire and sell tickets,\u201d the Ticketek spokesman said. Live Performance Australia endorses laws against bots too, which might be difficult to enforce but will at least send a message. \u201cThere has always been ticket scalping and people profiteering from buying tickets on the primary market, but now there are more ways for scalpers to quickly flip them and get them on to the secondary market \u2026 and a greater variety of platforms for people to resell,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cTicketing companies themselves invest a lot of technical resources and money into defending against bots, and they will continue to do that as the technology gets more sophisticated.\u201d In the US, Congress is considering legislation to curb bot activity (\u201cI did not want to pay $800 [for a Hamilton] ticket,\u201d a Florida Democratic senator, Bill Nelson, said in a hearing); and the UK is awaiting a government response to a secondary ticketing review which was published in May \u2013 as the #toutsout campaign gains steam. Richardson stressed that while Australia was watching for potential solutions, its industry functioned differently. The commonality was that \u201cthe resale market is a growing market\u201d \u2013 but Australia\u2019s solution, she said, was \u201cclunky at the moment\u201d. \u201cWith respect to large-scale profiteering, that is a challenge and I think we\u2019ll see technological solutions to it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing internationally \u2013 and even in Australia \u2013 a move to paperless tickets and other ways of controlling the inventory so that scalpers can\u2019t get access to it \u2026 Increasingly, venues and promoters are looking at how they can respond, how they can control it, and manage it in a more effective way.\u201d Buyer beware Bots are just one of the technological factors at play; another is Google AdWords, which are paid for by resale sites to prioritise their listings over the primary sellers. According to the Ticketek spokesman, within 48 hours of the Guns N\u2019 Roses tour going on sale in August there were 9,000 tickets available on the resale market, worth almost $4m. The concert itself had not yet sold out through Ticketek \u2013 meaning people were finding the reseller links first, thanks to ads on Google, and buying tickets at inflated prices well before they needed to. In the case of the Seinfeld shows, those Google ads looked like this: With the branding of sites such as Ticketmaster Resale not dissimilar to that of Ticketmaster itself \u2013 and with many resale listings not showing a ticket\u2019s original price \u2013 many customers don\u2019t realise they are purchasing a ticket through a secondary source for more money than it is worth. Defenders of sites such as Ticketmaster Resale say they themselves offer a protection against a growth in ticket fraud, facilitated by digital technology. Their big markups merely cover fraud protection and customer care, and the guarantee that fake tickets will be refunded. But until there is a better regulatory system, Richardson said the onus was on the buyer. \u201cIt is very much a case of buyer beware,\u201d she said. \u201cKnow where you\u2019re buying your ticket from. If you\u2019re buying on a secondary site, you can\u2019t be sure that the ticket you\u2019re buying is a valid ticket. \u201cIf it\u2019s for a show where the promoter or the venue say you can\u2019t resell, then they reserve the right to cancel the ticket \u2013 and they may do that. And if you bought it on a secondary site, then getting a refund is going to be difficult.\u201d The issue was one of education, Richardson said. \u201cDoes the customer understand that they\u2019re paying a premium price, and they\u2019re paying a commission fee? If they understand that and they still make that choice, then that\u2019s an informed choice. But I think the issue that we\u2019re focused on is insuring that the consumer is properly informed.\u201d Richardson recommended that customers add an extra step to their ticket purchasing. \u201cI say this to people I know: find out the venue or the promoter who is the primary authorised seller and check out their site,\u201d she said. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the promoter\u2019s official ticketing partner and bypass the misleading Google result. \u201cFrom an industry perspective, we\u2019re very mindful of some of the challenges that [digital scalping] raises and we\u2019re looking at how we can respond to those as quickly as we can. But, in the meantime, the consumer needs to be diligent about checking where they are buying their ticket from.\u201d Do you have an experience of ticket resales to share?
