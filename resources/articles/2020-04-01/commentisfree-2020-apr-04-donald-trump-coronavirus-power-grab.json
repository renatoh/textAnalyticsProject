But it is also tailor-made for Donald Trump, who has spent a lifetime exploiting chaos for personal gain and blaming others for losses. \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility\u201d for the slow rate of coronavirus testing in the US, he said. On Friday, when asked if he could assure New Yorkers there would be enough ventilators next week when virus victims are expected to overwhelm city hospitals, he replied: \u201cNo. They should have had more ventilators.\u201d Trump has told governors to find life-saving equipment on their own. He refuses to create a central bargaining agent, arguing the federal government is \u201cnot a shipping clerk\u201d. This has left states and cities bidding against each other, driving up prices. Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor, described how ventilators went from $25,000 to $45,000 \u201cbecause we bid $25,000. California says, \u2018I\u2019ll give you $30,000\u2019 and Illinois says, \u2018I\u2019ll give you $35,000\u2019 and Florida says \u2018I\u2019ll give you $40,000. And then, Fema [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] gets involved and Fema starts bidding! \u201cAnd now Fema is bidding on top of the 50! So Fema is driving up the price. What sense does this make? We\u2019re literally bidding up the prices ourselves.\u201d New York state is paying 20 cents for gloves that normally cost less than five cents, $7.50 for masks that normally go for 50 cents, $2,795 for infusion pumps that normally cost half that, $248,841 for a portable X-ray machine that typically sells for $30,000 to $80,000. Who\u2019s pocketing all this? An array of producers, importers, wholesalers and speculators. State laws against price gouging usually don\u2019t apply to government purchases. Some of it may be finding its way into this fall\u2019s election campaigns. The veteran Republican fundraiser Mike Gula and Republican political operative John Thomas just started a company selling coronavirus testing kits, personal protective equipment and other \u201chard to find medical supplies to beat the outbreak\u201d. They call themselves \u201cthe largest global network of Covid-19 medical suppliers\u201d. Asked how he\u2019d found such equipment, Gula explained: \u201cI have relationships with a lot of people.\u201d Thomas added: \u201cIn politics \u2013 especially if you\u2019re at a high enough level \u2013 you are one phone call away from anybody in the world.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner \u2013 who\u2019s one phone call away from anyone \u2013 is running a \u201cshadow\u201d coronavirus task force that has been enlisting the private sector and overseeing the Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies, all out of public view. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile \u2013 it\u2019s not supposed to be state stockpiles,\u201d he said cryptically on Thursday. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget the giant coronavirus bill Trump signed into law on 27 March, which created a $500bn fund that Trump and his treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, will distribute to the private sector. Most of it will backstop $4.5tn of subsidized loans (ie, bailout money) coming from the Fed, also distributed by the Treasury. In a signing statement, Trump said he wouldn\u2019t agree to provisions in the bill for congressional oversight \u2013 meaning the wheeling-and-dealing will be in secret. When the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said she\u2019d form a special select committee to watch how the money is spent, Trump accused her of \u201cconducting partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic\u201d, adding: \u201cHere we go again \u2026 It\u2019s witch hunt after witch hunt.\u201d Is there any doubt Trump will try to use this money, as well as his son-in-law\u2019s secretive dealings, to improve his odds of re-election? Trump was impeached a mere three and a half months ago on charges of abuse of power and obstructing investigations. Eight months ago, he phoned the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, seeking dirt on Joe Biden and threatening to hold up military aid to get it. In June 2016, his son Donald Jr and Jared Kushner met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, after a Russian intermediary contacted Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would \u201cincriminate\u201d Hillary Clinton and be \u201cvery useful to your father\u201d, adding it was part of the Russian government\u2019s \u201csupport\u201d for Trump. Donald Trump calls allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election a \u201choax\u201d. He called his impeachment a \u201choax\u201d. He initially called the coronavirus a \u201choax\u201d. But the real hoax is Trump\u2019s commitment to America. In reality he will do anything \u2013 anything \u2013 to hold on to power. In his mind, the coronavirus crisis is just another opportunity.
