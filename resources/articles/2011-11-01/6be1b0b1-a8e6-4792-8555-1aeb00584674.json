The Rugby Football Union have targeted Nick Mallett, the former South Africa and Italy coach, for the top job and, despite ruling himself out week, they have asked him to reconsider. \"I recognise my own skill set and it's not right for the top job,\" said Ryan, the former Gloucester head coach and England No8 who has been tipped for a job by many experts since England's quarter-final defeat to France at the World Cup last month. \"I know I could deliver on the technical side but I'm not canvassing to be back in the game. If somebody thinks I could play a part in their team I will listen to what their vision is, I think anybody would, but I would need a lot of convincing.\" Ryan has been working for Sky since leaving his post at Gloucester in 2009 and is a columnist for the Observer. He believes a key challenge for whoever takes over the England side will be carving out a working relationship with the RFU and its Rugby Operations Director, Rob Andrew, and getting the right backroom team in place. \"Whoever they choose as that No1 person must have the authority to fill the gaps around him,\" he said. \"The talk of me and all those other people who could potentially be part of the team is irrelevant until they get that right. Whether I could play a role depends on who they get and whether they want me. And even if all of that is in place, I would still need a lot of convincing that person could get the level of influence in the RFU he would need to structure things in the right way.\" The RFU has not given up on Mallett, who ruled himself out of contention for the head coach role on the day of Johnson's resignation. He has been asked to reconsider and to some he is the ideal candidate because of his experience, his immediate availability, and because his recruitment would eliminate the need for a performance director to be placed above the England head coach. There is a lobby in the RFU that would prefer an English coach to be appointed. Northampton's coach, Jim Mallinder, is one such contender, though he said on Friday he had yet to receive any approach. \"I've said previously that I'm interested but it's a little bit hypothetical at the moment because there's been no knock on the door,\" he said. \"Coaching your national side is a massive honour but there's been no questions asked.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
