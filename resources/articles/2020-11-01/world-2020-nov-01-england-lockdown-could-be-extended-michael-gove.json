When the prime minister announced the new measures in a Saturday night press conference, he said they would end on 2 December. But Gove told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme the measures would be reviewed at the end of the period and could last longer if they had not done enough to contain the spread of the virus. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this four-week period, during which we\u2019re going to review progress, but of course we\u2019ll always be driven by the data,\u201d Gove said. \u201cWe will always take a decision in the national interest, based on evidence.\u201d Pressed on whether that meant the measures could be extended, he said \u201cyes\u201d. The new lockdown marked a sharp reversal from Johnson\u2019s repeated rejections of Labour\u2019s calls for a \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d shutdown. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, claimed the government\u2019s delay in implementing a lockdown had been economically and socially damaging. \u201cAn earlier lockdown would have been better for health, better for the NHS and better for the economy,\u201d he told Marr. Starmer promised Labour would support the new measures when they were voted on by the House of Commons on Wednesday. Johnson has in recent weeks faced protests from Tory backbenchers sceptical about the necessity for tougher restrictions. Gove\u2019s admission that the lockdown may need to last longer was echoed by Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Farrar told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show that the 2 December review date was \u201cuseful\u201d, but the government should not become fixed on it. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the situation is going to be like in the last week of November and the first week of December, we all hope that four weeks is going to be enough,\u201d he said. If infections, hospital admissions and other key metrics had not fallen sufficiently, he said, \u201cit would be much better to extend this lockdown for another couple of weeks prior to the Christmas period and then loosen the restrictions a little bit over Christmas so that people can meet up with their families\u201d. \u201cMuch better to do that than remove these restrictions and then have to impose even more draconian restrictions over Christmas or soon into the new year.\u201d Farrar also questioned whether schools \u2013 in particular secondary schools, which some studies have suggested play a role in transmission \u2013 might need to be closed in future to make a shutdown more effective. But Gove stressed the government\u2019s determination to ensure schools remain open \u2013 a view echoed by Starmer, whose circuit breaker call did not include closing schools. Farrar suggested the regional approach to managing the disease, which involved local deals painstakingly assembled with leaders in Greater Manchester, Liverpool and elsewhere, was likely to give way to nationwide rules. However, Gove said ministers were keen to retain the ability to impose regional restrictions, to control regional outbreaks in future. \u201cThe regional approach is one that wherever possible we want to take,\u201d he said. Challenged by Marr about whether the government had made a mistake in failing to implement a lockdown when advised to do so by its own scientific advisers in September \u2013 when Starmer was also calling for it \u2013 Gove said it was too soon to say. \u201cI think it is impossible to know definitively until the end of this pandemic, which were the mistakes, and which were the missteps, which were most serious, and something that looks like a mistake at a certain point can actually in retrospect with more evidence have been proven to have been right,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
