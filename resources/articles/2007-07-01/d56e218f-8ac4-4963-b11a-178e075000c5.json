Channel 4's Dispatches will tomorrow say that housebuilders and lobbyists working for them are boasting of having used 'overt political pressure' to 'secure safeguards against prescriptive... policies dictating size, type and affordability to developers'. The Housing Minister, Yvette Cooper, last week said the government wanted 240,000 new homes a year by 2016, the vast majority built by the private sector. At least 70,000 of those are supposed to be in the 'affordable' category. An early draft of national planning policy shows that ministers wanted to force tough affordable housing targets on developers - and impose penalties on housebuilders which failed to comply. But following the lobbying effort, developers successfully changed the policy, now known as PPS3. When the final published version emerged, it had dropped all reference to compulsion or punishment if housebuilders failed to deliver affordable housing. The Home Builders' Federation, the trade body for the housebuilding industry, mounted a major twin-track effort against the draft proposals at regional and national levels. Following the HBF's opposition, the national policy was watered down, requiring local authorities to 'work closely with developers and home builders', instead of being able to impose targets on them. The HBF denied it had lobbied against affordable housing, saying it supported the concept. A spokesman said: 'Our aim has always been to ensure that home builders can effectively play their part in providing sufficient housing to meet all requirements across the market.' \u00b7 Dispatches: Britain's Bad Housing is at 8pm tomorrow on Channel 4."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
