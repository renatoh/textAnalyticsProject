There were booklets in the pews, like orders of service, but instead of hymns they listed obscure northern soul records from the 1960s. It was the first of three performances, conceived by 32-year-old artist Matt Stokes, called Sacred Selections. Not always a man whose art sought inspiration in church music, Stokes was last year commissioned to create a piece inspired by Dundee. In the process he discovered St Salvador's, a local church that used to host northern soul events. His entry for the ICA's Beck's Futures prize, the winners of which are to be announced today, is a seven-minute film called Long After Tonight is All Over and lovingly recreates one such event. The organ recitals, first performed in Dundee, constitute a companion piece. Over the next two weeks other London churches will provide the venues for performances of the toytown melodies of happy hardcore and the brooding chords of black metal. All three genres, Sacred Selections suggests, inspire a fervour and loyalty akin to religious devotion. As a teenager, Stokes was part of an intense music subculture himself: rave. But that scene, unlike the ones featured in Sacred Selections, died away. \"The essence of rave culture became diluted until it pretty much didn't exist any more,\" he says sadly. \"The Northern soul scene is still raw in its intensity.\" Before the St Paul's recital, Stokes introduced the work with two readings: one an newspaper editorial from the 1880s detailing the introduction of pipe organs into Dundee's Presbyterian churches, and an early music column by the northern soul evangelist Dave Godin. Delivered from the lectern, the pieces sounded as weighty as scripture, linked by ideas of reverence, faith and communal celebration. Some of the songs, meanwhile, foundered in translation. Northern soul, with its urgent rhythms and hurricane-strength vocals, was built for dancing; pipe organs were certainly not. As the music played, some people craned their necks behind them to watch the organists; others faced forwards and nodded along; one woman took the opportunity to leaf through her friend's holiday photos. The five-song set ended on a high with the warm, muscular melody of Dean Parrish's On My Way, the last ever song played at northern soul epicentre the Wigan Casino. Even the holiday photos were tucked away for that one. On the steps outside afterwards, spectators chattered with the puzzled delight of people who weren't quite sure what to make of it. \"It was crazy but it was interesting,\" decided one woman. Meanwhile, the organists, Daniel Moult and William Whitehead, exchanged grins. \"Some of the more uptempo ones don't work so well,\" said Whitehead. \"You miss the drums.\" He has adapted pop music for the organ once before: \"I've had to do the Phantom of the Opera for a wedding. The bride wanted to come into that, would you believe?\" Charles Grant, the concert's director, seemed pleased with the turnout. \"A hundred people walked through the doors tonight who never normally come to church.\" What did he make of the music itself? \"I liked I'm On My Way.\" He smiled before rushing off to lock up. \"I'd like that for my funeral\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
