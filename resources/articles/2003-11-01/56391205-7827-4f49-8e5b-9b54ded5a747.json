The 24-year-old former Derby forward, who has scored once this season, has had the leg encased in plaster while surgeons consider whether surgery is necessary. Steve McClaren, the Middlesbrough manager, said: \"It is an enormous blow for us to lose a key player in this way. We're getting very little luck with injuries but we have to get on with it.\" Joseph Desire-Job is out with a long-term knee injury while his fellow striker Noel Whelan is out for eight weeks after tearing a hamstring while on loan to Millwall at the weekend. Chris Riggott has injured an ankle, fellow defender Robbie Stockdale's spell on loan at West Ham has been cut short by a hamstring injury and Ugo Ehiogu has yet to play this season because of a knee problem. Tony Adams will today be unveiled as Wycombe's new manager, with his former mentor Ars\u00e8ne Wenger offering him his full support. \"I wish him good luck,\" said Wenger as the former England captain Adams prepares to take his first steps in football management. \"He wants to learn the job and he has all the attributes. He knows how to deal tactically with problems. Of course it takes time to settle and adapt and to learn the job but this is a good opportunity to do that. My biggest advice to him is: try to be yourself, don't try to copy anybody else. I think he will do that very well.\" Leeds have fined their striker Mark Viduka one week's wages, around \u00a365,000, for turning up late for training. The Australia international learned of his punishment at a meeting with the manager Peter Reid who said yesterday: \"There is a discipline at the club and he has gone beyond those boundaries.\" Viduka turned up late for training before Saturday's game against Arsenal for which he was dropped. The incident casts further uncertainty over his future. Viduka's agent, Andrea D'Amico, said: \"I don't know about Mark's future - I am working day by day. Mark is a professional so he knows that during a career lots of things can happen. He just wishes the season had gone better for Leeds and himself.\" Kevin Keegan, the Manchester City manager, has decided not to fine Robbie Fowler after giving the entire first-team squad a dressing room lecture yesterday. This followed publication of photographs of Fowler in a Colchester nightclub last Thursday. Only 24 hours earlier Keegan had been telling reporters that Fowler was no longer \"the jack-the-lad\" of recent years. Keegan said later: \"The players had permission to go out that evening and so did not break any club rules.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
