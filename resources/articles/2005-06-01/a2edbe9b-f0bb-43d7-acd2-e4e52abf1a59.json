At Pen Mill Farm cars were parked in a slippery field. \"Don't worry,\" a voice called. \"There are plenty of us to pull you out.\" Below and to the left was a spacious, four-square house, and to its right, an elegant spread of lawns, borders and shrubs sloping down to a lake. The owners told me that this had been the mill manager's house, built in 1813. Two generations had now landscaped the garden and introduced a range of plantings, some of them exotic, to achieve the effect that visitors were admiring. The lingering presence of a few surviving eels had discouraged their children from swimming in what once had been an eel lake. The buildings in this shady dell, close to where the infant river Stour tumbles down from its source at Stourhead, are of greensand stone, a lovely light grey, and there is the constant sound of water running in streams and gullies. I walked through to the Old Mill garden. What was once the mill leat is now grassy, the banks terraced and planted with shrubs, making a cool, green retreat. I had no time to go on to see a garden with bamboo suggesting a Japanese influence, or another with a collection of more than 30 clematis, or the \"pleached hornbeam allee\" in a garden inspired by Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll. But facing drizzle or no, others were evidently determined to see them all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
