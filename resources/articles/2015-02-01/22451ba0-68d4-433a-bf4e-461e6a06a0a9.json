Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t seen episode seven. Catch up with our episode six recap The Latimer trial Essentially, this was just set-up for next week\u2019s finale \u2013 closing speeches from each barrister, a teasing moment when the jury came back into court to ask a couple of questions, a late-in-the-day suggestion that Ellie had bribed her sister to give a statement (which she kind of did). In the background, Mark and Beth\u2019s relationship continued to freefall towards separation, destroyed by Mark\u2019s affair, the grief of losing Danny, the lies and, indeed, the truth about Mark\u2019s actions during those hot days of summer. (Also in the background: Tracey\u2019s son was denied his right of appeal, and Jocelyn mourned her mother. An audience shrugged. The only really exciting bit was when Abby got what she deserved: \u201cYou\u2019re a really horrible person\u201d just about sums it up.) I\u2019m not saying all of this part of the episode was filler, but I imagine we could have skipped straight to next week\u2019s finale without it causing many problems. It\u2019s hardly as if the legal arguments have been given at such a pace, or have been so complicated, that it has been difficult to keep up. Or if either of the closing speeches were particularly compelling television. Sandbrook Crikey. Maybe more of us should nip into hospital for pacemaker operations if the result is instant recovery and a new lease of life. We fairly ripped through the detail in the hunt for Pippa\u2019s killer and Lisa\u2019s whereabouts as Hardy commandeered Miller\u2019s car (and her to drive it) and went clue-searching. So here\u2019s what we \u2013 and Hardy and Miller \u2013 now know: \u2022 Claire turned up at court with the pendant following her furious parting with Lee and the advice of Paul to face her monsters. She says the pendant was hers, that she gave it to Pippa. But she also admits to stealing it after it was seized as evidence, resulting in the collapse of the police case. \u2022 Claire, Lee, Ricky and Kate\u2019s stories about their whereabouts on the Saturday seem to make sense. (Although there is a lot of working going on for a Saturday, I must say.) \u2022 Gary Thorpe, who took over his dad\u2019s agricultural services business was also Lisa\u2019s stalker after falling for her hard when they went out. He borrowed some money from Ricky Gillespie. \u2022 Gillespie needed some prompting to remember Gary. Hardy and Miller now know Claire had his number in her mobile. \u2022 Ricky was hilarious when quizzed about a painting of bluebells he\u2019s had for a year or two. \u201cErrr, yes, they\u2019re all right, you know. They\u2019re a flower \u2026\u201d Meanwhile, Hardy has been increasing the pressure on Claire and Lee: on Claire by chucking her out of the cottage, causing her to rage madly in last week\u2019s episode; on Lee by informing him that Claire was pregnant and didn\u2019t tell her (but did tell him). Cue violent sea-fighting that started out quite scary and turned increasingly bonkers. It also gave Broadchurch another opportunity to use its favourite watery motif \u2013 only this time it wasn\u2019t Alec being pulled beneath the waves, but the increasingly fighty couple. Lee is heading back to France, where nobody but one female person knows who he is. Presumably that person is Lisa, if Alec\u2019s suspicions prove correct, and Lee only knows that Gary was Lisa\u2019s stalker because he has a much stronger relationship with her than he\u2019s admitting to. I wonder whether Lee and Claire are protecting Lisa, rather than each other, who possibly killed Pippa accidentally and asked for their help. Thoughts and observations \u2022 Beth is having a terrible time with Mark. But it is good to see her friendship with Ellie at least part-mended. Some respite for both of them. \u2022 Now that Hardy is miraculously fixed, he\u2019ll soon be able to drive himself round. \u2022 I had presumed for ages that Maggie and Jocelyn were either still a couple, or at the very least had been lovers at some point in the past. The cliff-top picnic \u2013 which frankly looked more bracing than romantic \u2013 could have happened episodes ago. \u2022 I feared we were going to have some more grunty alfresco sex when Lee and Claire started rolling around in the water. Thankfully, we were spared that (and they were spared hypothermia). \u2022 \u201cYou know the boy who works at the local newspaper, Ellie Miller\u2019s nephew? I might have shagged him.\u201d \u201cBloody hell! I hope you gave him a good time.\u201d \u2022 The judges advice to the jury was quite interesting \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard that before. Obviously, I\u2019m not sure how much to believe it. \u2022 The likelihood of an idyllic, freshly painted beach hut being spare and ready for Claire to break into and sleep in? Let\u2019s just say there\u2019s a waiting list of more than a year in my bit of Cornwall. \u2022 On which note: the likelihood of a British seaside town where it never rains? How long have we been in Broadchurch now? It\u2019s not just an unseasonal dry spell any more \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
