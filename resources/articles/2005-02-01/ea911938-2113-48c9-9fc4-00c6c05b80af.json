What they mean is South Beach; and South Beach is tiny. You can walk the entire length of dazzling Ocean Drive, from its tip to the Delano Hotel, in three-quarters of an hour, including time to punch out a couple of roller-bladers and point at the Versace mansion where Gianni was shot (possibly by a town planner: his rococo palace is far too wedding cake for South Beach's art deco cool). Though you'll spot every kind of car here - Ferraris, Minis, Humvees - you don't need one yourself. Which means that you can use all that dosh you've saved on car hire to splash out on the odd big night. And if you stay in The Clinton, on Washington, between 8th and 9th, you'll save even more. It's a dinky, easy-going place, with a pool and bar, free email in reception, and rooms that remind me of The Standard in LA - not fancy, but cool and well-equipped. If you pick a suite (they're not big), you get a Jacuzzi on your balcony. And you get none of that tip-me bullying from doormen that comes part and can-I-help-you-with-that parcel with swanky hotels. Ta da, you're in the money. And even more so, these days, as the pound is so strong. But before you get too Diddy with your dollars, remember that South Beach is a playboy's paradise, and a couple of nights' hard partying will leave your wallet screaming for mercy. Not a nice noise on a hangover. So, how to do South Beach without mugging Mariah Carey? (Though don't let me hold you back.) Meet Nick McCabe. Nick is a Geordie who moved here five years ago, and has set up a website just for you and me. Called cooljunkie.com, it will get you on the guest list of all the best clubs for free. \"It's a weird thing,\" he tells me, over a vodka and tonic at The Sky Bar, \"because the clubs want to be full, but they don't want to be seen to let just anyone in, which is where we come in.\" And so we do, waltzing past squabbling queues and velvet ropes into all the right clubs. Which include, at the moment: Mynt, Crobar, Mansion, Sky Bar and Amika. All within a short cab ride or walking distance of each other, and all . . . weird. Miami clubs, the posh ones, are strange environments. First, there's hardly any dancefloor. Either it's taken up by a swimming pool (as in the Sky Bar, or the bar at the Delano) - and don't dip a toe, unless you want to be thrown out - or, as in Mansion, or Amika, the space right in front of the DJ booth is a lounge area, with a sofa and small tables. You get in there by renting a table for the night, for hundreds of dollars: though why anyone would want an exclusive seat slap next to the speakers I don't know. You can't hear, you can't speak, you can't dance. Still, I suppose everyone can see you've got money - which is always the point, in Miami. The second strange thing about Miami clubs is how many of them have beds instead of seats. At night, the Delano and Sky Bar replace sun-loungers with linen-covered double mattresses, complete with pillows and white lace curtains. There's even a club called BED, which started it all. BED is an example of another strange Miami habit: restaurants that morph into nightclubs - Tantra does the same. Neither are cheap as eateries: but both are worth the money. Tantra, especially, has an amazing menu, a PR who's also an excellent sommelier, and - this is very Miami - real live grass on the floor. At BED and Tantra, the older, smarter eating crowd come in around 8pm, then the partiers after 11. But the oddest aspect of Miami's cool clubs is how naff they are. The music is rubbish, ranging all the way from 50 Cent to Usher, and the clientele are dressed like they're going to the golf club (men) or to a mini skirt convention (women). Everyone is very beautiful, I suppose; flat-stomached and shiny-haired, with their tops tucked into their trousers - but they're not lively enough to work up a club atmosphere hotter than a menopausal flush. Oh well. After a few drinks, you stop caring, because Miami clubs are fantastic, enchanting environments, for all their strangeness. All they need are brilliant DJs: which they get during the Miami Music Convention, in March. If you can't go then (and it won't be cheap), the best music is at Amika, Crobar and BED. Jet lag and a hangover are a cocktail too far. The next day, on a friend's recommendation, I head straight for Puerta Sagres, on Collins Avenue. A Cuban diner, with a mad interior mural, it serves breakfast until midday - but the lunch specials, like roast chicken with rice and black beans, are more tempting. The coffee's proper too, and, this being Miami, no one minds if you keep your sunglasses on. A scan of The Miami Herald headlines: the Iraqi elections, and how oddly-shaped tomatoes are being discriminated against. Ah, the USA. A TV news item I saw last night: \"This man has one of the most unique jobs in America - he rents out his forehead to advertisers.\" Puerta Sagres is just near a few chains - Gap, Armani Exchange, Urban Outfitters - all bargains compared with UK prices. My plan is to pop into a couple, then walk the hundred yards to the beach - the cheapest way to spend any day, unless you pay $18 for a lounger and umbrella - but the sky darkens and it starts chucking it down. Instead, I check out the Wolfsonian museum, round the corner. It's fantastic: packed with art nouveau and deco design gems, from an Eiffel Tower silver teapot to a bookcase shaped like a skyscraper. There are beautiful posters and souvenirs of world fairs, from the original Crystal Palace one in 1851 to New York in 1939. Incongruously, there's also a huge stained glass window depicting works of Irish literary genius, commissioned by the Irish Free State in 1926 as a gift to the League of Nations. To see it in South Beach is disconcerting; especially as there's not another visitor in the museum. No one goes to galleries. Miami's idea of fine art - as evidenced by posters dotted about that read, Art Is All Around! - is two blokes practising capoiera on the beach. Which is a martial art. They've so nearly got it. It's still raining, so I catch a cab up Washington to the thrift shops around 15th and 16th. Recycled Blues is the most organised, though the unnamed store next door has the best selection of cowboy boots. In one that's more junk than funky, I meet a lady who insists on showing me how she's going to alter what I can only describe as an African print all-in-one hot-pant-vest combo into an African dress with long sleeves. \"I'm 57,\" she says, though her eyes look older beneath her smudged make-up. There are a lot of toasted people in Miami; homeless men kip on the beach, junkies snatch at invisible insects in the air. The rain stops; I go for a drink at a cafe on pedestrianised Lincoln Avenue. Though the clubs may only admit one type of person, you only have to sit for a few minutes to see the variety of South Beach wildlife. Elderly roller-bladers with ghetto blasters, Whitneys dressed as Britneys, the fattest families in the world, a Tupac look-a-like carrying, not a gun, or even an iPod, but two tiny chihuahuas. Anything even vaguely interesting causes an amiable crowd to gather; I think of leaving my bag in the street, to cause a terrorist alert, but realise that it would be gently interviewed as to where it's from and can we get a picture with it? These simple, sociable crowds are why the visitors that fancy themselves sophisticated spend such an effort getting into the right places. I watch two women trying to talk their way into BED for an early dinner and know, from the doorwoman's body language, that they don't stand a chance. When I get in, the place is empty. Miami is flash mixed with friendly, a place for everyone as well as for Paris Hilton to launch her singing career at an exclusive soiree at Amika. Sun, sea and sand are democratic attractions. Like piddling dogs, the rich have to demarcate their area. (Which makes it all the more fun when you sneak in, of course. If nothing else works, just be well-presented and sociable. And female. You won't pay for a single drink.) In the evening, Nick takes me to a club off South Beach, over the bridge in the Design District. It's called Pawn Shop, because it used to be one. A massive warehouse filled with indy kids throwing themselves around to Franz Ferdinand and The Killers, it's a real laugh; the Charlatans' Tim Burgess is DJing later. The Design District is to South Beach what Brooklyn is to Manhattan; cheaper, grubbier, artsier, up-and-coming. It's close to downtown, where you can get cheap hotel deals at the weekend. Try the new Conrad; it's a bit businessy, but the rooftop pool is fantastic. Downtown is just about within walking distance of Little Havana, which is worth a short wander, so the next day, I have a peek off Calle Ocho, into Domino Park, a tiny space where old Cuban men gather to play chess and dominos. They don't mind you checking them out especially if you're a lone woman, though it helps if you can speak Spanish (they don't speak English). But Little Havana's dollar shops and sad Hispanic Hollywood-style pavement stars start to get to me so I cab it back to South Beach. It's sunny today, so beaching is my plan. And, oh, it's lovely, just miles and miles of white sand, all scrupulously hygienic in the no-drinking-no-dogs-no-music American manner. Though there are thousands of weekenders, today swelled by Miami marathon runners, there's enough room for everyone. And when you wander off for an Ocean Drive lunch - try the Diesel-owned Pelican: friendly staff, gorgeous steaks - you can always find a post again when you get back. The views, in every direction, are great. Blue sea one way, pastel art deco the other, and in between hunky, silly holidayers, running after balls and frisbees like daft mutts, getting over-excited when they see a topless sunbather. The beach is the cheapest and the best part of Miami. How strange that it's the part that everyone shares.
