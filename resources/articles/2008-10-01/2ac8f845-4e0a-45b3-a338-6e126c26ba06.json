Drona is a fantasy blockbuster, with a marketing drive unusual for Indian film. It's the simple tale of a man who finds he is predestined to become the saviour of the universe, on an epic journey to protect the nectar of immortality. Drona stretches its budget admirably: the plentiful effects and action are comparable to western fare, and the gorgeous locations - from car chases through cities to desert horse pursuits - provide a far richer palette of colour and texture than is usual for the genre. The narrative only works in fits and starts (perhaps that's what English-language blockbusters look like to Indian audiences). It's a step in the right direction, but they could have performed a leap."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
