The season's hard, with tough games week in week out and the guys need something for it. Hopefully somebody will give whoever finishes first next year some recognition, because it's the hardest thing to do in the year. \"But at the same time I'm in favour of the play-offs. It gives the players, especially the non-internationals, the chance to play on the biggest stage, and the fans get their time at Twickenham. As long as we win, it will just cap the year off.\" Robinson's rugby league background means he has plenty of experience of sudden-death title deciders. He scored the match-winning try for Wigan in the first Super League grand final in 1998 but two years later his farewell to the code was ruined when Wigan were beaten 29-16 by a St Helens team who had finished three points below them in the table. The most memorable image of that night was of Robinson being consoled on the pitch by Apollo Perelini, the Saints prop who was moving with him to Sale, and perhaps that is why he remains a first-past-the-post traditionalist when it comes to determining league champions. Robinson has particular reason to be aggrieved as one of the motivations for his retirement from international rugby last summer was to ensure consistent availability for Sale, a major factor in their best league finish. The Sharks' bright start to the 2004-05 season had been derailed when half their team disappeared for the autumn internationals and Robinson admitted: \"Last season during the international periods it was hard for the club and as a result we didn't finish where we wanted to. \"One of the main things we said before the start of this one was that we needed to perform during the internationals, to keep standards up when some of the senior players aren't here, and pick the points up. Thankfully it worked out that way and it resulted in us finishing top.\" Robinson has clearly relished the Sale captaincy and takes pride in justifying the faith shown in him by the club's financial driving force Brian Kennedy when he lured him from Wigan six years ago. \"I feel blessed that I'm able to lead these guys out,\" he added. \"It's been five years to get to this position. One of the main reasons for coming over was to help Sale become one of the forces in the Premiership with Brian Kennedy putting his money in, getting the right people here. Things are starting to look good.\" He agrees that the new coaching team of Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 and Kingsley Jones have taken the club to another level, while stressing the important role played by their predecessors such as Jim Mallinder. \"Things have gone in stages. There have been people before Philippe who have done a great job and taken the team up a level and now you've got Philippe and Kingsley coming in with the backing from Brian. All credit to him [Saint-Andr\u00e9], he's brought in some good players which we needed for strength in depth and with that has come results. Philippe knows what he's talking about, he knows what he wants from the players and he expects us to perform on match days. He's a winner.\" Now performing on the day, rather than through the course of the season, will determine whether Sale are crowned Premiership champions for the first time, ensuring that Saint-Andr\u00e9 will surely draw on the extensive big-match experience of his captain more than ever before. \"When you're the captain one of your main jobs is making sure that the team perform and that preparation goes well throughout the week,\" Robinson said. \"You can't just look at your own job and leave it at that. We've got to make sure the occasion doesn't get the better of us, it's all about staying calm and enjoying it. \"It's a funny time of the year because everybody knows come Saturday night that's it, you're clocked off work for five weeks. \"Everybody's looking forward to holidays and things but we must finish the job, it's as simple as that. I want to go away from this thinking 'Wow, it's the best season Sale have had in history and I've been part of it.'\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
