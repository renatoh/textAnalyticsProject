Indeed the suspicion was that Newcastle\u2019s manager had seized inspiration from his book at bedtime on a day when, the debutant Robin Olsen apart, Ancelotti\u2019s admittedly somewhat ersatz side were decidedly second best as they succumbed to two Callum Wilson goals. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more pleased,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cWe knew it would be a battle against one of the great managers but we deserved it. Tactically, we were right.\u201d With Seamus Coleman and James Rodr\u00edguez injured and Lucas Digne and Richarlison suspended, the Italian was forced into a reshuffle. It involved the selection of five central midfielders in a visiting starting XI low on pace and width. That ensemble also lacked Jordan Pickford, the England goalkeeper having been demoted to the bench with Everton\u2019s manager claiming he was rested rather than dropped. The former Sunderland man will have been disappointed not to face a Newcastle team he has long relished attempting to undo. It cannot have helped that his unwanted seat on the sidelines afforded a rather dull view of a decidedly low-octane Everton display. If featured an experimental 4-2-3-1 formation in which Ancelotti had apparently instructed Fabian Delph to shuttle between a holding midfield role and stand in cameos at left-back whenever Niels Nkounkou attempted, usually forlornly, to advance. Olsen, Pickford\u2019s replacement, initially had little to do. More than 30 minutes had passed before the Sweden goalkeeper, borrowed from Roma, was called to arms after Newcastle counterattacked smartly from an Everton corner and Miguel Almir\u00f3n and Callum Wilson combined cleverly to create a shooting chance for Allan Saint-Maximin. Rising to the challenge, Olsen advanced from his line, spread himself and, exuding competence, saved the Frenchman\u2019s attempted dink. Maybe Pickford has serious competition at club, as well as international, level after all? Bruce looked considerably happier than Ancelotti and had reason to believe Newcastle\u2019s return to a revamped version of 3-5-2 now offers his side a judicious balance between much-needed stability and counterattacking menace. This mood of rare Tyneside optimism was symbolised by the appearance of a stunning rainbow arcing over the Gallowgate end following a rain shower. Appropriately enough, its arrival coincided with Wilson giving Newcastle the lead from the penalty spot after the scorer\u2019s stumble in the face of Andr\u00e9 Gomes\u2019s clumsy challenge. Wilson had evidently avoided being distracted by the escalation of a long-running dispute with Yerry Mina in the preamble to the penalty that resulted in a booking for the striker. When Sean Longstaff, excellent in central midfield, subsequently collected Wilson\u2019s typically shrewd pass, swivelled sharply and shot low Newcastle looked set to extend their lead but Olsen saved brilliantly. The goalkeeper had no answer to Wilson though as the striker again evaded his reach in the 84th minute. This time Jamal Lewis\u2019s long pass liberated Ryan Fraser and, with the substitute having dodged Mina\u2019s attempted challenge, his lofted cross deflected off the back-pedalling Mina and was steered in from close range by Wilson, well positioned at the far post. Dominic Calvert-Lewin reduced the deficit after getting a toe to Alex Iwobi\u2019s deflected stoppage-time cross yet Ancelotti was not deceived. \u201cIt was not a good performance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Robin Olsen was good, he was in control. I am used to rotating goalkeepers so it won\u2019t be the last time he plays.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
