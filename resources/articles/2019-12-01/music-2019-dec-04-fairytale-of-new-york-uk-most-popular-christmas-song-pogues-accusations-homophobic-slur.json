The song has been subject to criticism in recent years for its lyric, sung by Kirsty MacColl: \u201cYou scumbag, you maggot, you cheap lousy faggot.\u201d In 2018, Eoghan McDermott, a DJ for Irish national broadcaster RTE, had called for the lyric to be censored, arguing: \u201cEnough vitriol out there without gay people having to feel uncomfortable so people that aren\u2019t affected by an insult can tap their toe.\u201d Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan responded, saying it was \u201cnot intended to offend \u2026 The word was used by the character because it fitted with the way she would speak and with her character \u2026 She is not supposed to be a nice person, or even a wholesome person. She is a woman of a certain generation at a certain time in history, and she is down on her luck and desperate.\u201d The furore hasn\u2019t damaged the song\u2019s popularity. PRS for Music found that it was the most played seasonal track across 50 regional UK radio stations in 2018. Furthermore, in a new survey of 2,000 people asked for their favourite Christmas songs, Fairytale of New York topped the chart. It was followed by Wham!\u2019s Last Christmas, Slade\u2019s Merry Christmas Everybody and Bing Crosby\u2019s White Christmas. Per the lyrics to Slade\u2019s hit, those surveyed clearly thought \u201cthe old songs are the best\u201d \u2013 none of the top 20 songs are from this century, with Cliff Richard\u2019s The Millennium Prayer, released in November 1999, the most recent choice at No 20. In 2007, the BBC censored Fairytale of New York to remove the words \u201cfaggot\u201d and \u201cslut\u201d, though reversed the decision shortly afterwards. Radio 1 boss Andy Parfitt said at the time the decision was \u201cwrong \u2026 an embarrassing day for Radio 1\u201d. This week, Alex Dyke, a DJ for local radio station BBC Radio Solent, said he was \u201cno longer comfortable\u201d playing the song on his show. In a since-deleted tweet, he described the song as \u201can offensive pile of downmarket chav bilge\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
