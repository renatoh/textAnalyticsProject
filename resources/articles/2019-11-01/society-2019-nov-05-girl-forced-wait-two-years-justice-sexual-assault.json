Raising her shaking right hand, the girl swore a simple six-word oath recited by children in courts across England and Wales: \u201cI promise to tell the truth.\u201d The girl then cried her way through an hour of testimony about the night she was sexually assaulted by a close friend, who sat across the courtroom from her. It was the first time she had seen him since the night two summers ago when he had sexually assaulted her as she slept. She was 16 when it happened, she explained, and had been at the boy\u2019s house for a sleepover with another male friend. They had chatted, smoked cannabis and relaxed before she fell asleep on a beanbag between the two boys. But when she woke up, she felt \u201cstrange\u201d, she said. She had been molested in her sleep. In cross-examination, the girl broke down. She was questioned about smoking cannabis, about \u201cbehavioural issues\u201d at school, how many blankets were on the beanbag, and whether she had heard rumours at the time about the boy touching other girls inappropriately. The suggestion, said the defendant\u2019s barrister, Tim Hopley, was that she had simply \u201cmade it all up\u201d. It was August 2019 and the victim was being questioned about the minutiae of a night in July 2017 that she was desperate to forget. She had told her mother and the police about the assault straight away. She was taking medication for her mental health, the court was told, and she spoke slowly with long, tearful pauses. After a three-day trial, the district judge James Hatton found the boy guilty of sexual assault. He was given a supervised community order, told to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work, pay \u00a3280 costs to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and a \u00a320 victim surcharge. Barristers said a two-year delay in bringing a case to trial was no longer unusual for some offences heard in the youth court, despite official guidelines requiring justice to be done as quickly as possible. The judiciary\u2019s youth courts handbook states: \u201cJustice delayed may be justice denied in respect of all parties, not just the child or young person.\u201d Only two trials were heard at Manchester youth court in the month covered by the Guardian; both cases had taken more than two years to get from arrest to trial. Cuts to the police and CPS are contributing to the delays, according to barristers who specialise in youth justice, with fewer officers and lawyers to investigate offences. The delays are particularly problematic when it comes to children\u2019s ability to remember key details. Research has found that younger children remember fewer details than older children and adults, potentially putting them at a huge disadvantage when giving testimony in court."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
