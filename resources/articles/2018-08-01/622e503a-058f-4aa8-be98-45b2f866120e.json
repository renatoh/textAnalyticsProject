He managed only eight matches for the club, two starts for England and each time he found his form and fitness another injury setback arrived. As he had been identified, perhaps a little hastily, as the solution to all England\u2019s openside problems, his spells on the sidelines were all the more frustrating for club and country. But that is not quite how he sees it. Underhill\u2019s problems may have started as early as his Premiership debut for Bath \u2013 the first of multiple concussions suffered last season occurring an hour into an impressive showing \u2013 but he shrugs off concerns that he is too prone to injury. \u201cIt is annoying. I am only 22 so I am hoping I have a fair bit more rugby to play. For most people it is rare they go through a whole career without injuries,\u201d says Underhill. \u201cLast year was still a good year. I played eight games for Bath and five for England \u2013 that is not a disaster of a season, it is just not a good season. Not having many club games put it into a \u2018bad season\u2019.\u201d Concerns over Underhill\u2019s wellbeing became more serious when he suffered another head injury in England\u2019s second autumn international against Australia last November. His Bath director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, urged England not to pick him for the Six Nations. Underhill, meanwhile, is grateful for the extended time off he was afforded by his club, who open their Premiership season at Bristol next Friday. \u201cThe biggest thing is the impact it has on the rest of your life. It\u2019s not specific to rugby or to sport. You have only one brain and it\u2019s vital to your wellbeing in general. I was in a fortunate position where I was well looked after but some guys might not be so lucky, depending on the set-up, age, environment, circumstances, whatever it might be. \u201cIt\u2019s just about showing there\u2019s nothing wrong with coming off the pitch. There\u2019s always going to be an element of getting a knock to the head: \u2018Am I concussed?\u2019 I might not be but you can\u2019t play rugby without banging your head into something. It\u2019s about recognising that enough is enough and there\u2019s nothing wrong with putting your hand up and saying: \u2018I\u2019m not feeling right.\u2019 Ending the stigma around it is the big thing.\u201d Underhill\u2019s last Premiership appearance last season came in October but he did make two European starts for Bath in January before he was selected for the Six Nations, making replacement appearances against Italy, Wales \u2013 catching the eye with that remarkable tackle on Scott Williams \u2013 as well as Scotland. He suffered a toe injury during England training soon afterwards, though, and was ultimately ruled out for the rest of the season. Bath\u2019s first-team coach, Toby Booth, said Underhill returned to the club broken but, if the back-row ever needed a dose of perspective, it came only a few weeks ago. \u201cAll of my mates from first year graduated this summer,\u201d says Underhill who still hopes to complete the economics degree he began in Cardiff when with the Ospreys. \u201cI did catch up with them and congratulated them all. It was a bit of an insight into what I could have been like \u2013 most of them are unemployed. Injuries aren\u2019t avoidable \u2013 you have to keep yourself in a positive frame of mind and control what you can control. I am working hard to make myself as durable as I can within the areas I can control.\u201d Eddie Jones has been aware of Underhill\u2019s potential ever since he was brought to his attention by the World Cup winner Richard Hill shortly after taking over in 2016. He holds him in such high regard that Underhill was made one of two defensive captains on only his second appearance against Argentina last autumn but in his absence Tom Curry started all three June Tests in South Africa. \u201cI am under no illusions as to where I am [with England],\u201d says Underhill. \u201cIf I want to be in that team, I have got to earn the right to be in that team. Everyone does. I am fitter than I was when I came in [to England] and I am fitter than I was lastI am under no illusions as to how hard it is going to be but it is something I am looking forward to. season. I am bigger, heavier, moving relatively well. My body feels relatively good \u2013 obviously I have not played any rugby but in terms of training here I feel like I have developed as a player. To be honest, I just want to play.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
