The Rugby Football Union had arranged Test matches against Tonga, Samoa and Fiji on three consecutive weekends from June 21 but a combination of Rugby World Cup Ltd, South Africa and New Zealand has led to those dates being taken over. England have been offered the first three weekends of June as an alternative but, since the domestic season does not end until June 8, the proposal has been turned down. The RFU, which has agreed to foot the \u00a3500,000 bill for the whole tour, was tempted to call it off but Woodward has insisted he wants to take his players away even though most of his Lions who spent last summer in Australia will be given the month off. The trip is on the International Rugby Board's tours schedule but RWC has arranged World Cup qualifying matches for Fiji, Tonga and Samoa starting on June 1 and they will go on for six weeks. In addition New Zealand and South Africa have arranged to play the Pacific Lions, a combined team from the three island groups, on June 29 and July 6, even though those weekends will clash with the World Cup matches. \"We are trying to sort things out but there are more problems than opportunities and we are getting very concerned about the situation,\" said Francis Baron, the RFU chief executive. \"We are in discussions with the IRB to see what can be arranged but something has to happen in the next couple of weeks. \"One solution is for the Pacific Lions to play their games against New Zealand and South Africa later in the year. We understand their reason for arranging those matches, which is financial, but there is a tour schedule which we think should be stuck to. At the moment we are not thinking about alternative destinations but Clive has made it very clear he wants a build-up to the World Cup so that is what he'll get. It is very concerning but we have not given up all hope.\" The RFU has been criticised on more than one occasion by the IRB since the game went professional for doing its own thing. But, while Twickenham appears to have right on its side this time, it has been putting pressure on the board in recent months to rip up the tour schedule and arrange a new one to run in line with a global development policy to help the poorer, emerging nations such as the South Sea islands. The IRB has yet to respond formally to a document produced by the RFU in November which recommended that the eight foundation unions adopt two emerging countries each and provided help, practical rather than financial, throughout the year. England will be sending a Counties squad to Chile this summer, with the board paying some of the costs, but the bigger picture remains blurred. \"I will be meeting Vernon Pugh [the IRB chairman] later this month and I will express our disappointment at the lack of reaction to our paper,\" said Graeme Cattermole, chairman of the RFU's management board. \"If nothing continues to happen, we will call a meeting of the other seven foundation unions and the board to push this issue forward. Something needs to be done to properly help the developing countries.\" The RFU's charity is even extending to the Six Nations television contract which is due for renewal at the end of the season. A tender document will be sent out to potential bidders this week but, while England went it alone five years ago and negotiated an \u00a387.5m deal with BSkyB, finding themselves temporarily expelled from the tournament as a consequence, they are now very much part of the collective process. \"It is very important to get the right level of money for all the countries involved, especially Italy,\" said Baron. \"We have to make sure the Italians get a fair deal because they do not have a proportionate share at the moment. They are struggling and need the extra resources.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
