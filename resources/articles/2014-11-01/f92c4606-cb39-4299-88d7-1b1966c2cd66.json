It\u2019s cruel that the game in this country has surged in popularity since Warren\u2019s death, having only experienced relatively incremental growth during the long period while Australian football\u2019s loudest advocate was leading his tireless against-the-odds charge. Warren was in many ways a man ahead of his time. To be passionate about football, hold a world view and cosmopolitan tastes is now common place. During the 1960s and 1970s in Australia such tastes were a cause for suspicion. As such Warren sometimes felt an outsider in his own country, but for those who shared his enthusiasm he was a guiding light in a land of non-believers. To be a football fan in years gone by could be likened to being a member of a subculture, and Warren was undoubtedly the spokesperson for many unheard voices. \u201cThe more he got knocked over the more he became determined,\u201d said Jamie Warren, Johnny\u2019s nephew who now maintains his legacy via the Johnny Warren Foundation. \u201cHe was a self-confessed football missionary.\u201d \u201cHe couldn\u2019t understand the resistance to the game. I recall Johnny saying he experienced his own discrimination. He said he was called a sheila, wog or poofter every day.\u201d Hence the title of Warren\u2019s seminal biography. Though an all-round sportsman, Warren fell in love with the game from a young age, no doubt a zeal aided by his two older football-playing brothers. A few doors up the road in Botany, in Sydney\u2019s inner south lived John Watkiss. The two young boys stoked each other\u2019s passion for the game and, incredibly, both featured in Australia\u2019s squad at the 1974 World Cup. Warren played initially for Canterbury, but it was at St George where he experienced a different side to football. The Hungarian-backed club featured cultured Central Europeans and skilful South Americans. It was an eye-opener for Warren both on and off the field. In later years he developed a passion for Brazil, both the country and its jogo bonito traditions. He earned the friendship and respect of Pele. Warren had an ability to represent the local game across all demographics and classes. It is no coincidence that he was the first sportsman to be granted a NSW state funeral. No doubt \u2018wog Warren\u2019, as he was nicknamed in his youth, would have found humour in the fact that it was a \u2018sheila, wog or poofter\u2019 granted such an honour. Warren ran his own football camps on his Canberra property during the early 1980s. \u201cThe amount of people I still get coming up to me even now saying those camps were unbelievable is just amazing,\u201d says Jamie. Warren further contributed to the growth of the game by organising funding for gifted young players to travel overseas on scholarships. One such youngster was future Socceroo captain Paul Okon. Among his many contributions at SBS, Warren developed and hosted the ground-breaking Captain Socceroo, a program aimed at a young demographic that introduced fresh aspects of the game to a new audience. Mark Viduka once said it was his favourite TV program growing up. Such comments suggest Warren\u2019s influence and legacy is almost impossible to quantify. \u201cYou could speak to him for five minutes and feel you had known him his whole life,\u201d says Jamie. And if you were a true believer, all the better. I can vouch for Jamie\u2019s view from personal experience. The brother of a friend, who was gravely ill in hospital, wondered out loud if Johnny would make a hospital visit to lift his spirits. Despite the fact that my friend was unknown to him, Warren unhesitatingly agreed. A member of the brotherhood needed help. Captain Socceroo duly visited and was generous with his time. Paul eventually recovered from that life-threatening situation. On exiting St George hospital on the day of the visit Johnny said \u201cyou never know when you are going to get sick\u201d. Three months later Warren was told he had cancer. Perhaps he knew deep down that he too was sick. If so, his actions are all the more noble. That incident represents the real Warren \u2013 committed, passionate, generous and with a deep sense of the football community within Australia. \u201cWhen I\u2019m up in the big football field in the sky, I just want people to remember, I told you so,\u201d Warren famously once said. One year and one day after his funeral the Socceroos qualified for the World Cup in that boys-own drama penalty shoot-out win. Uruguay\u2019s Alvaro Recoba talked about his nation\u2019s \u2018divine right\u2019 to be at the World Cup. Perhaps Australian football had a stronger power looking down from above that night. \u201cI told you so,\u201d was a catch-cry that famous evening, as it was also at the 2006 World Cup where the national team rubbed shoulders with the world\u2019s best and did so with distinction. Nine years earlier Warren broke down on national television, despairing for the future after the Socceroos heart-breaking World Cup qualifying exit against Iran. The leader\u2019s public anguish spoke for all that night. But a year after Warren\u2019s death the Socceroos qualified for the World Cup, the A-League was established and Australia joined the Asian Football Confederation. All within the space of a few months. This week\u2019s remarkable achievement by Western Sydney Wanderers in conquering Asia would have delighted Warren. Last Sunday there were more people literally dancing on the streets of Parramatta in the small hours than there were attending national league games in the same city just over a decade ago. If he were around Johnny would have been in tears again, this time for all the right reasons. He would also have enjoyed the fact that the Wanderers don the red and black hoops of a great Brazilian club, Flamengo. The local game has indeed come a long way. Warren\u2019s name would have been first on the speed dial of those in the mainstream media who only dabble in football on rare occasions. Ironically it is against such figures and their dated intransigence that Johnny rallied against as much as anything. Some of Johnny\u2019s oldest and dearest football mates gathered in the Jamberoo Pub on Wednesday night to raise a toast to the late great Captain Socceroo. The little town just south of Wollongong is where Warren spent many of his later years, and the pub, part-owned by his brother Ross boasts a rare level of Aussie football memorabilia. It is somehow appropriate the closest thing to an Australian football shrine is in the humble environs of the ultimate egalitarian setting, a country pub. \u201cIt\u2019s just so disappointing that Johnny is not here to see the growth in the game and the heights it has achieved,\u201d said Warren\u2019s former team-mate Ray Baartz from the back bar at the Jamberoo Pub. \u201cJohnny had the foresight to envisage the true potential that the game had. We thought he was kidding himself, but he was right and we were wrong.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
