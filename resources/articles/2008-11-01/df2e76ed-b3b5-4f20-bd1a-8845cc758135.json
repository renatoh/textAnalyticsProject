First up: Wolf Blitzer (who's only preposterous in a nice way, really). If you weren't watching CNN, you might have missed that network's excessively high-tech 3D hologram interviews, which had the effect of a) making the interviewee look like he or she was in a bad sci-fi movie, rather than, say, against a backdrop of thousands of impassioned Obama supporters, which would surely have made for better television, and b) turning Blitzer all flirtatious: Second, a moment I didn't catch live, but which seems quickly to be entering the TV history books: Gore Vidal subjecting David Dimbleby to the full force of his baffling disdain on the BBC... ...and finally Ralph Nader, rather less amusingly welcoming America's first black president by using the phrase 'Uncle Tom', rendering Fox News's most impressive interviewer, Shephard Smith, speechless. Every time you think Ralph Nader has destroyed the last shreds of his credibility, he finds another old shred down the back of the sofa and destroys that one, too. (\"There's no ideological defence,\" writes Ezra Klein, \"for a man who continually pursues a strategy meant to set back progress towards his goals. You could argue, of course, that in 2000, he didn't know better. That it was an accident. But in 2004 and 2008 he did. At that point, his efforts to elect Republicans ceased being an accident and emerged, fairly clearly, as a plan.\")"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
