On Thursday the Victorian Law Reform Commission released its consultation paper on contempt law reform, and related legislation on accessing information about court proceedings. The review was ordered by the attorney general in December after a jury delivered a unanimous guilty verdict in the trial of Cardinal George Pell for historic child sexual abuse offences. There has also been debate generally in Victoria over many years about the use of suppression orders. While a suppression order temporarily prohibits publication of a verdict or information about a trial, in Pell\u2019s case the guilty verdict was published by some news outlets despite a comprehensive suppression order being in place. While several international news outlets named Pell, a number of Australian publications wrote about the verdict but did not name Pell or go into detail about the case. Other individuals and news organisations published the verdict on social media. The reporting led to 36 news organisations, journalists and editors potentially facing jail time and fines for contempt of court. Online publication of information \u201craises legal and practical issues for courts seeking to enforce prohibitions and restrictions on publication\u201d, the consultation paper states. These issues include how to define \u201cpublication\u201d, what power courts should have to enforce suppression orders made in Victoria in other states and territories and in other countries, and how to identify the original publisher of information posted online when it has been republished multiple times or was originally published anonymously. The paper also asks how courts should approach enforcement of court orders if they become rendered futile by \u201cthe posting, sharing and discussion of suppressed information on social media networks like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram\u201d. Other high-profile cases in recent years have also sparked debate about whether suppression and contempt laws should be reviewed. In 2017, three federal government ministers narrowly avoided contempt of court charges for criticising the Victorian judiciary over terrorism offence sentencing while a high-profile terror hearing was still under way. An independent judiciary free from political pressure or influence is a pillar of the legal system. The Victorian Law Reform Commission paper, which is open for consultation until 28 June, asks for feedback on what weight, if any, should be given to apologies in determining whether a contempt of court penalty should be imposed. It also asks if a maximum penalty should be determined, as there is no statutory limit on the maximum penalty that may be imposed for the offence by the county or supreme courts. The commission\u2019s focus is on the most common types of contempt, including contempt in or near the courtroom, contempt by jurors, non-compliance with court orders, and contempt by publication. \u201cThe commission will take into consideration the development of the internet and new media, and research on juror decision-making, the consultation paper states. It points out that there is \u201coverwhelming judicial experience\u201d that juries follow directions from the court, such as not to read media reports about the case they are considering."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
