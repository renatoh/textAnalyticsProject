It\u2019s the full Monty, telescoping back to Harrison\u2019s humble origins in Liverpool, his rise to fame and his eventual search for spiritual meaning. Scorcese has access to previously unseen footage and unheard material, plus contributions from Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Phil Spector, Ringo Starr, Tom Petty, Yoko Ono and others whose reflections magnify the many contradictions inherent in a simple yet complex man. He makes the most of it in this two-hour biography. Tuesday 24 December Royal Variety Performance, 7.30pm, ABC1 A few weeks ago, Adam Hills reflected on a meeting with Her Majesty following the 2009 edition of this annual gig (Adam Hills Stands Up Live). Hills recycled substantial chunks of his routine that night \u2013 in a somewhat toned down fashion, understandably - and wrung good mileage from his royal post-show introduction. This year Australia is represented by the legendary Dame Edna Everage, who also has used royalty to her own ends. Also on the bill: a number from the new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical about osteopath to the stars, Steven Ward; songs from the West End hit Charlie And The Chocolate Factory; and Torvill and Dean celebrating the 30th anniversary of their Bolero moment. The event will be hosted by actor/comedian John Bishop. Thursday 26 December Boxing Day Test, 10am, Channel 9 With secular festivities out of the way and holidays beckoning, we can get down to the serious business of religious indulgence \u2013 namely the traditional Boxing Day test match at the MCG. The rivalry between England and Australia is as intense as ever \u2013 even if one side are dominating proceedings \u2013 which is just the ticket for 100,000 fans at the G and viewers willing to endure the barrage of commercials lobbed down the wicket between overs by the broadcaster. We might not have snow and reindeer here, but the tradition of the Boxing Day test is far more significant than the furious department store sales or the Sydney/Hobart yacht race. The Time of the Doctor, 7.30pm, ABC1 A Dr Who Christmas special in which Matt Smith regenerates as Peter Capaldi during a 300 year-long war on the planet Trenzalore. The conflict involves Cybermen, Daleks, Weeping Angels and Sontarans. It would be sacrilege to say more but it\u2019s a well-comported transition with Jenna Coleman along for the ride as Clara. Call the Midwife, 8.30pm, ABC1 More time travels \u2013 this time back to the year 1958 for a Call The Midwife christmas special. The snow lies round about Nonnatus House, deep and crisp and even but danger lurks in the form of an unexploded wartime bomb. Sunday 29 December The President Vs The Pirates, 10pm, SBS One What prompted the spate of hijackings and kidnappings in waters off the horn of Africa begin? This doco, telling the story to date of Abdirahman Farole, the president of Puntland in the coastal north of Somalia, explains a lot that has been largely ignored in international efforts to stamp out piracy. Farole, who had fled to Australia as a refugee, returned to Puntland after 20 years and was, against the odds, elected president on a platform of curtailing piracy and constraining jihadists of the Al-Shabaab movement. This program focuses on the president\u2019s vision for democracy in the region but ends on a cautionary note: two weeks after filming, the country\u2019s most senior cleric, Abdulkadir Nur Fareh was shot dead during evening prayers at his mosque. Doors Open, 8.30pm, ABC1 Stephen Fry features as a disgruntled art curator in this cheerful caper written by Ian Rankin. As Professor Robert Gissing, Fry curates a significant collection of Scottish artworks for a major bank. He is appalled when bean counters decide to liquidate the precious asset. Supervising the inventory and sale catalogue is Laura Stanton, former squeeze of Gissing\u2019s millionaire friend, IT entrepreneur Mike McKenzie (Douglas Henshall). Central to the scam that emerges when Gissing, McKenzie and a disgruntled former bank employee, Allan Cruikshank, decide to nick some of the artworks, is a portrait McKenzie had given Laura as a gift some years earlier, and which she has since flogged. His wounded yet on-going affection for her plays a key part in a light-hearted drama with just the right amount of comic counterpoint. Old fashioned holiday material, it\u2019s relaxed if not involving or challenging viewing. Monday 30 December Edinburgh Military Tattoo, 8.30pm, ABC1 The term silly season could have been coined to describe the annual knees-up at Edinburgh Castle: marching bands, massed pipes and drums, precision drill teams and fragrant dancers in a reverent reinforcement of Celtic military traditions. This is about spit and polish, and close-order drill \u2013 a Show-Us-Yer-Tatts spectacular conducted each August since 1950 and which attracts a global TV audience numbering 100 million. Long-time viewers while appreciating Bill Paterson\u2019s narration of the annual telecast will still yearn for the familiar tones of Alasdair Hutton who refined the curious mixture of the solemn and the sublime and who remains the voice of the event for many. Tuesday 31 December New Year\u2019s Eve Fireworks, 9pm and 11.55pm, Nine Fireworks on television are like Leunig\u2019s memorable cartoon of a family watching a glorious sunrise on the telly while the real thing occurs, in full view, right outside. True, it shares the occasion with viewers outside the Sydney metropolitan area but there\u2019s nothing like the visual actuality combined with the sensation of shock waves from maroons and the gasps of incredulous observers as clouds of cordite and gunpowder waft across the city. Incredulity that between $4m and $6m has just gone up in smoke. Watching this annual frivolity on TV means negotiating the anodyne commentary offered by network \u201cpersonalities\u201d who struggle to say anything more than the bleeding obvious. There IS nothing to say and if there was, you wouldn\u2019t call upon these drones with expensive dentistry to enunciate it. Thursday 2 January Bad Education, 9pm, ABC 2 Forget Gonski, Pyne and the venerable marshmallow twizz of To Sir With Love. The new year kicks off with a timely and long-overdue education revolution. Classroom dramas and comedies are nothing new of course but this series, revolving around the worst teacher ever to grace the British education system is a giant leap in the right direction. Meet Alfie Wickers (Jack Whitehall), a self-styled maverick educator at Abbey Grove Public School. Just 23 and fresh out of teacher training he\u2019s completely slew-footed, naff and way less mature than most of his pupils. It\u2019s sharp, quick and beguiling comedy, and after the ABC\u2019s recent capers involving Ja\u2019mie and the forthcoming return of Chris Lilley\u2019s other enfant terrible, Jonah Takalua, this is something to savour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
