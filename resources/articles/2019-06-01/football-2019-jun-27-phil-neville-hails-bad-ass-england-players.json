The Lionesses\u2019 manager had demanded a 10 to 15% improvement in performance but got much more than that as they swept Norway aside 3-0 in a more straightforward than advertised quarter-final. Afterwards Neville had no inhibitions about spelling out the extent of his ambitions, stressing: \u201cWe\u2019re in it to win it.\u201d Goals from Jill Scott, Ellen White and Lucy Bronze took England smoothly into a semi-final against USA or France in Lyon. On a wild evening by the Channel illuminated by Bronze\u2019s swashbuckling play from right-back, Norway were simply blown away. \u201cTwelve months ago we set out our objectives,\u201d said Neville. \u201cAll I wanted my players to say was that they wanted to win the World Cup but they said they wanted more, to create a name people would relate to, badass women. They were thinking bigger and that really knocked me out of my stride. I think we\u2019re getting to that legacy moment. \u201cI thought the difference tonight was we were more ruthless than before. But I\u2019ve got the best job ever. You can be the best coach ever but if you haven\u2019t got players with attitude and determination then you\u2019re dead. But I work with an astonishing group of people who astonish me and astound me every day. I just want to win a World Cup.\u201d By now Neville was thoroughly warming to his theme and perhaps got a bit over-excited about the passing style he has introduced. \u201cWe\u2019re playing a type of football that no one\u2019s ever played before,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that will get us through the semi. I\u2019m not getting carried away but I said to them in the huddle: are you ready to win the World Cup? They have glazed eyes. Something is happening, we can\u2019t hide that. We can\u2019t wait until Tuesday. I was brought in to get us through a semi-final.\u201d Neville revealed that Beckham had given his players a \u201c5pm team talk\u201d, there was also a \u201cgoose bump\u201d-raising video message from the multi-gold-medal-winning Olympian Katherine Grainger and afterwards they met Ian Wright, who relaxed them by cracking jokes. \u201cMy players loved it,\u201d Neville said. \u201cDavid has been supporting us from day one and is an icon and Ian knew all their nicknames and made them laugh. My job was made easy. It was one of the proudest moments I\u2019ve had in football. But I\u2019m lucky, I\u2019m just the coach. My players go out and play with bravery, play the right way. Our style is non-negotiable. We\u2019re having fun and we don\u2019t want to go home.\u201d He reserved special praise for Bronze. \u201cShe is the best player in the world,\u2019 he said. \u201cShe should win the Ballon d\u2019Or 100%. You saw a player at the top of her game. She\u2019s the best, there\u2019s no one like her.\u201d While Bronze described the prospect of returning to Lyon, where she plays for the French champions, as \u201ca dream come true in the city that I love\u201d, Norway\u2019s coach, Martin Sj\u00f6gren, was magnanimous in defeat. \u201cOf course England can win the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cThey play at a very high level and are a very good team. Lucy Bronze is a tremendous player, she has shown she is absolutely one of the best players in the world. We knew the right side of England was good and we prepared. But however much you prepare you can\u2019t always be immune. We tried to reignite the fire and the hope but it was a rough night for us but England deserved to go through.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
