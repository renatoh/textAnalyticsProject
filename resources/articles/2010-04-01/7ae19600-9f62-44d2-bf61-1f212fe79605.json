The figures, which will detail in full for the first time the club's outstanding liabilities, are expected to show that overall they are in debt to the tune of \u00a3105m but also received \u00a314m in expected transfer fee instalments upfront. Overall, the club owe at least \u00a3119m. The document will be sent to unsecured creditors, owed around \u00a390m, as the joint administrator, Andrew Andronikou, attempts to secure a Company Voluntary Arrangement that would see their debts settled at a reduced rate over a period of up to five years. The list includes \u00a338m owed to former owners, thought to include \u00a330.5m in loans put in by Sacha Gaydamak, who sold the club last August and presaged a disastrous spell as it went through four owners in the space of a season. More than \u00a39m of the \u00a3105m debt is owed to 15 agents, reflecting the revolving-door policy and excessive fees. In one deal alone, an agent is owed \u00a32.3m. \"There are agents and scouts owed over \u00a39m,\" Andronikou told Soccernet yesterday. \"There are agents such as Pini Zahavi, who is owed \u00a32m, but there is one agent who is owed \u00a32.3m for just one deal alone, the transfer of [Lassana] Diarra. It is staggering. There must be something like 15 agents owed money, which illustrates how the club were buying and selling so many big-name players.\" The Guardian has seen a letter from Zahavi \u2013 a key figure in the saga, with links to their manager Avram Grant \u2013 to the insolvency specialists Vantis in which he confirms that he is owed two payments of \u00a31.475m and \u20ac950,000 respectively. Another agency, Stellar Football, told the company, compiling a report at the behest of the high court before the club entered administration, that it was owed \u00a3320,000. Around \u00a35m is believed to be owed to trade creditors, including the printing company that produces the club's programme, and \u00a31m owed on hire purchase. Balram Chainrai, the club's fourth owner of a turbulent season, will not be a party to the CVA and would be repaid his \u00a313.5m loan in full, according to Andronikou's plan. There is some dispute about his status as a secured creditor after it was queried by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, but Andronikou is expected to treat him as such. HMRC is owed around \u00a315m and was expected to oppose the CVA on the basis that it does not agree with the football creditors rule, which guarantees payment in full to players and clubs. But it is understood that it will only oppose the CVA if it feels it has a realistic chance of success. Andronikou must convince 75% of the unsecured creditor base to agree to the CVA if he is to achieve his ambition of getting the club out of administration by the first week of June and persuade Uefa to accept its late application for a licence that will enable them to play in the Europa League. \"We hope the club will come out of administration by the end of May, or the first week of June at the latest,\" said Andronikou yesterday. \"Hopefully that will meet a lot of the criteria and our application will meet with approval. I think the Football Association and Premier League will be right behind our application.\" Rob Lloyd, the property tycoon fronting a consortium that hopes to take over the club, was meeting accountants last night and hopes to make a formal offer this week. But Andronikou yesterday said: \"We are no nearer to a buyer than we have been for the past two months.\" He added: \"Will one be in place for the Cup final? Who knows? Rob Lloyd seems keen to make a formal offer, but he has yet to do so, and there is one major sporting franchise group who approached me again the day after we won the semi-final. There are a few fishing around.\" The revelations will further anger fans concerned at the spiralling nature of Portsmouth's debt. Andronikou initially predicted the debt would \"bottom out\" at \u00a378m, but since then he has claimed it would be around \u00a3100m. He recently told the Guardian that there was no inconsistency, citing a figure of \u00a385m that he said he referred to at his first press conference. \"I said at my initial press conference that the overall debt was \u00a385m. So if you add on the charge holder's debt, that takes it to just over \u00a3100m. The CVA will only be for \u00a385m, it won't include the charge holder's debts,\" he said. The \u00a314m advanced by one of several companies that specialise in securing advances for clubs against transfer fees will not be included in the CVA and should not technically be included in the overall debt figre, Andronikou said yesterday. That is because it is effectively underwritten by the Premier League and the Football League under the football creditors rule. The details of the loan will again shine a light on the practice of borrowing against promised income."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
