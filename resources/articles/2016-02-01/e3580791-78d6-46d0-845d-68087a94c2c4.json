There has been no change from the previous year in cutting Indigenous disadvantage in the seven target areas. Only two of the targets \u2013 cutting infant mortality and getting more students to finish high school \u2013 are on track to be met, mirroring exactly the results of the 2015 report. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids have lower rates of literacy and numeracy, and greater rates of truancy than non-Indigenous children. Indigenous children generally have lower reading skills than their peers, and go into high school without the minimum requirements. They fare better in numeracy, with Years 5 through to 9 achieving the same results as their non-Indigenous peers. Indigenous adults are likely to die 10 years earlier than other Australians, with the average life expectancy sitting at 69 years for Indigenous men and 73 years for Indigenous women. The overall employment rate for Australia\u2019s first peoples fell between 2008 and 2013, with less than 48% of 15-64 year olds holding down some form of a job. That figure varies widely depending on geography though, as Indigenous Australians in very remote areas have higher levels of unemployment than those in urban settings. Statistics on the number of four-year olds attending preschool is not yet available. The new target was set after a previous one on closing the gap in preschool levels failed in 2013. Despite the dismal progress in most of the targets, some good news shone through. The mortality rate for Indigenous youngsters under five has fallen by 33% overall since 1998, and has halved in the last 16 years. Indigenous children are now slightly more likely than their non-Indigenous peers to be immunised, and the number of women failing to have antenatal check-ups or smoking during pregnancy has fallen significantly. The target for students finishing high school is also on track to be met, and the as a result the number of Aboriginal and Torres strait Islander people enrolling in higher education courses has shot up by 70%. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, delivered the report in parliament on Wednesday, his first major speech on Indigenous affairs since taking the Liberal party leadership from Tony Abbott in September. \u201cWhen the first Closing the Gap report was tabled in 2009, as the leader of the opposition, I delivered a statement to parliament. I affirmed the Coalition\u2019s commitment to deliver a new future, with hope and opportunity for all, to Indigenous Australians,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, as prime minister, I stand by the intent of that commitment.\u201d Turnbull emphasised that closing the gap would require collaboration with first Australians themselves. \u201cI will honour that commitment not by delivering to Indigenous Australians, but by working with a diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders and communities across Australia,\u201d the prime minister said. Earlier in the day, Turnbull told a breakfast event at parliament that mutual respect is the \u201cabsolutely essential element that holds us together\u201d. He said parliamentarians needed to \u201credouble our efforts to build trust\u201d and that encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation with young Indigenous business leaders should be a focus. \u201cLocal engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people creates local solutions,\u201d he said. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, acknowledged that politicians from both sides of the political fence must \u201credouble\u201d their efforts and \u201crecognise the progress we have made is uneven and too slow\u201d. Shorten pledged an extra $9m for vision loss services to stamp out trachoma. \u201cWe are the last developed nation in the world where the infectious and wholly preventable eye disease of trachoma exists,\u201d he told Parliament. \u201cAddressing vision loss alone would close 11% of the current gap in health.\u201d He wants more Indigenous people to enter politics to effect change from within, and reiterated his calls for the government to introduce a new target on reducing incarceration rates for Indigenous Australians. The co-chair of the Close the Gap campaign, Mick Gooda, has also called for a justice target, saying that criminal behaviour is often a \u201cdownstream\u201d result of poor education and employment options."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
