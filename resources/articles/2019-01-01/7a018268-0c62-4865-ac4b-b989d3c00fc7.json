The Norwegian\u2019s comments come the day after Mauricio Pochettino dismissed silverware as merely \u201cbuilding egos\u201d, following Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s elimination from the FA Cup. When Solskj\u00e6r took over United were 11 points from a Champions League berth and are now only three. Although not talking directly about Pochettino\u2019s stance, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s not the dream, though, to be top four. We\u2019re Man United \u2013 you should always aim to win the league. We can\u2019t do that this year but we\u2019ve just got to look forward to that again because we have to get back to that.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r is targeting a trophy this season. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the Champions League, we\u2019ve got the FA Cup, we can\u2019t just say top four and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to look at: \u2018Can we win something this year?\u2019 \u201cI am not here to discuss what Pochettino says and what other managers say. First of all, it\u2019s the next game [that is vital] but we are about winning trophies, of course we are \u2013 and we can\u2019t win the league this year. I think every manager wants to win every game, so I don\u2019t think that is the point he [Pochettino] was making [that trophies are not desirable]. \u201cIf you win trophies, that\u2019s a fantastic day for everyone in the club; it\u2019s just the best time of your life, that day when you win, because you never know when the next one is going to come. I am just saying that here at this club we are looking to win trophies.\u201d If United defeat Burnley at Old Trafford on Tuesday, Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side they will draw level with Chelsea, who are fourth and play on Wednesday. \u201cThere is still a long way to go, so we just need to focus on the next game,\u201d he said of European Cup qualification. \u201cI know it\u2019s boring to hear this but it\u2019s about improving, it\u2019s about getting better. It\u2019s great that we\u2019ve picked up eight points [on fourth place].\u201d Solskj\u00e6r is preparing United for next season \u201cwith or without\u201d him still being in charge. As caretaker the Norwegian has won his opening eight games, with United having never fallen behind under him, yet his status remains as the temporary No 1. Solskj\u00e6r, though, is still considering the long-term development of the side. He said: \u201cWhat Manchester United are going to look like next season with or without me, it doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m here to prepare for next season.\u201d Part of this will be to play homegrown players \u2013 Mason Greenwood, Jimmy Garner and Ethan Hamilton. \u201cWe have quite a few talents in that youth team that you\u2019d like to see [in the side] and [you] will see at some point before next season to put the club and team in a good position [for] how will we look like next season: Mason, Jimmy, Ethan \u2013 it\u2019s just about the right time. But we\u2019ve got Alexis [S\u00e1nchez], Juan Mata and Romelu Lukaku who haven\u2019t played so much lately, they\u2019re three players you have to jump ahead of.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r reiterated that he does not think any players will leave in the transfer window. \u201cAt the moment I can see everyone staying at the club. No deals have been done with anyone. There are still a few more days but I\u2019m not too involved in the negotiations, so whatever happens happens. It\u2019ll be good to get the window closed and improving the players in the squad still here.\u201d Asked about the potential for midfielder Andreas Pereira to move this month, Solskj\u00e6r replied: \u201cNo. I can\u2019t see him going out on loan because Andreas has done fantastic in training ever since I come back. He\u2019s a player I can see playing quite a few games for us towards the end of the season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
