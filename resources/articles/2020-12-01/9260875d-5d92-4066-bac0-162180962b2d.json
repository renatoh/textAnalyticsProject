Top stories A China boycott will hit Australian wine harder than expected as fruit and vegetable prices rise, concludes the commodities report released today by the Department of Agriculture. Trade tensions are a \u201cdark spot\u201d in an otherwise recovering industry \u2013 our exposed commodity markets worth $19bn, by some estimates, with services worth a further $28bn of exports. Australia may be able to divert a \u201climited amount\u201d of wine to allies in the UK and the US, but China\u2019s tariffs will probably reduce the value of exports. The Abares report also warns that prices of summer vegetables, stone fruit, apples, pears and table grapes are forecast to rise by between 15% and 25%, due to Covid-19 travel restrictions limiting labour available for harvesting. A devastating new report says almost 3 billion animals were affected in the 2019-20 Australian bushfires, one of the \u201cworst wildlife disasters in modern history\u201d. The report, commissioned by WWF-Australia, includes 11 recommendations that call for better understanding of the impacts of bushfires, more research into species, and better management of other threats. The burned areas covered 12.6m hectares \u2013 an area almost the size of England. In the path of the flames lived some 181 million birds, 2.46 billion reptiles (including 51 million frogs) and 143 million mammals \u2013 including 61,000 koalas. Australia has a moral and ecological responsibility to save these animals and protect their habitats, one scientist stressed, because the vast majority exist nowhere else on Earth. The Coalition is proposing to retrospectively strip misclassified casual workers of up to $39bn in claims, with an industrial relations bill that attorney general Christian Porter will release today. It introduces a definition of casual employment and improved rights to request permanent work after 12 months. But the bill also states that if a court finds employees were owed the entitlements of a permanent worker, casual loading already paid will count towards this liability (which happens to address a case currently on appeal to the high court.) Unions have already rejected the proposal, arguing it will allow employers to continue hiring people as casuals despite them performing ongoing permanent work, and employees would be powerless to dispute refusals to convert. Australia A NSW police error was to blame for two German travellers flying from Sydney to Melbourne without quarantining, an act that prompted alarm in Victoria and potentially put a planeload of 176 people at risk. Victoria\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions, meanwhile, significantly eased after midnight. The state yesterday marked 37 straight days free of the virus. Households can now receive 30 visitors a day, mask-wearing rules have relaxed, and public gatherings can be up to 100. Labor\u2019s Penny Wong has said foreign affairs minister Marise Payne must respond to an allegation her push for a review of the pandemic\u2019s origins \u2013 one of the central grievances in the deteriorating relationship between Australia and China \u2013 was timed for a television announcement. Labor has also accused the government of quietly reclassifying Australians stranded overseas, in an attempt to avoid \u201cbad headlines\u201d over Scott Morrison\u2019s failure to return them by Christmas. The world The White House press secretary has appeared to admit Donald Trump lost the presidential election, a concession the president refuses to make (to the \u201cdisgust\u201d of one senior Republican). Trump\u2019s health secretary has meanwhile insisted Trump has a detailed vaccine rollout plan, dismissing criticism from Joe Biden as \u201cnonsense\u201d. France has hinted at a compromise with the UK over divergence from EU trade standards, though a minister repeated the threat of a French veto as troubled negotiations continued in Brussels. The family of author Roald Dahl has apologised for his antisemitism. A statement buried deep on the author\u2019s official website says his views caused \u201clasting and understandable hurt\u201d. Mysterious symptoms that have afflicted American diplomats stationed in Cuba are most likely to have been caused by \u201cdirected, pulsed radio frequency energy\u201d. A report on Havana syndrome commissioned by the US government did not identify the source of the energy \u2013 nor a possible culprit. Recommended reads \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t fuck it up,\u201d Netflix\u2019s Que Minh Luu said when the announcement landed: that she\u2019s rebooting Heartbreak High. Set in Sydney, the wildly popular 90s teen series was Australia\u2019s answer to Degrassi, and was known for its grittiness and honesty, tackling storylines involving sex, drugs, domestic violence and racism. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had something like that since,\u201d said Luu. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an Outlander. We don\u2019t have a Normal People \u2026 What we want to do is reflect what it\u2019s like to be a young person in Australia today.\u201d Wonder how a salon recycles 67 bags of hair? Australia\u2019s hairdressers are getting serious about recycling: using clippings for compost, turning bottles into eyewear, and keeping bleach out of the drain. But where does the waste go next? And how is it being used to soak up oil spills? \u201cArriving in the US from Australia during Covid was like walking through the looking glass,\u201d writes trained epidemiologist Abby Bloom, who travelled to visit her 106-year-old mother in New York. \u201cThe US and Australia are responding to the same pandemic but you would hardly know it: in the US magical thinking and the elevation of individual freedom above the public good has squandered precious time. Australia has shown that the response to a pandemic needs to be strict. Lives and a nation\u2019s economy hang in the balance.\u201d Listen Caught in Australia\u2019s campaign to \u201cstop the boats\u201d were 30,000 people who landed, only to enter a legal limbo.
