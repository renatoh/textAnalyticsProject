Then he was going to fly to London for a more efficient European press trip. Then his publicist forwarded an email from the 53-year-old songwriter: \u201cEvery round-trip flight from New York to London melts 32 sq ft of polar ice ... in light of global warming, any chance this could be done via FaceTime? These empires must crumble!\u201d Reading about Extinction Rebellion strengthened Callahan\u2019s decision, he says, when we speak by phone, along with hearing a friend cite that chilling statistic. Still, he will keep touring. \u201cPerforming music is worth melting the ice caps,\u201d he says, with a chuckle that clicks like a latch closing. Since his 2005 album A River Ain\u2019t Too Much to Love \u2013 his last as Smog, the name he made music under since 1990 \u2013 nature has taken root in Callahan\u2019s songs. Birds, horses, rivers and cattle populate his lyrics, telegraphing chaos, stubbornness, peace, and above all, an embrace of intuition. Less dissonant than his Smog work, this openhearted evolution \u2013 his tender songs elevated by laconic profundity \u2013 has affirmed him as one of the US\u2019s greatest songwriters. Yet Callahan\u2019s beautiful new album, Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest, is altogether more domestic, revealing his unexpected new life as a husband and father. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d make it this far,\u201d he sings on What Comes After Certainty. He had never understood the point of marriage or kids. Then he fell in love with Hanly Banks after she made a documentary about him. \u201cIt was like: \u2018Oh, here\u2019s my wife! And probably the mother of my child.\u2019 It was in her face, her aura. And there was no fear or doubt about it.\u201d On Callahan\u2019s 2013 album Dream River, he used the metaphor of flight to immortalise the awe of romantic contentment: \u201cI never like to land / Getting back up seems impossibly grand / We do it with ease,\u201d he sang on Small Plane. After his son\u2019s birth, Callahan thought he might drop music to become a full-time dad. His wife talked him out of it, but he struggled to start his next album. \u201cGiving birth nearly killed me / Some say I died\u201d, he sings on Son of the Sea, in that suave, mystic deadpan. He chuckles again. \u201cIt was kinda the death of Music Bill for a while, but he was resuscitated.\u201d As his son grew, Callahan eked out time to write, but nothing happened, even as he exercised, meditated and read to stoke the muse. \u201cI was trying to be Superman,\u201d he says. Then he remembered the importance of idleness: \u201cOn your list of things to do, you don\u2019t write: \u2018Daydream\u2019.\u201d Once he cracked it, he started writing with arresting candour for a man who has often been described as intimidating, or, he laments, \u201cfiercely private\u201d. Although more effusive now, he remains a careful conversationalist, approaching sentences like a man negotiating a treacherous slope. \u201cSky change the sea,\u201d he sings on The Beast. \u201cLove changed me.\u201d How? \u201cWell!\u201d That latch click again: \u201cI understand community now.\u201d To avoid small talk, he says, he would only \u201crun to the car when my neighbour wasn\u2019t outside. Now I\u2019ll go and say hi. I realised how we\u2019re all linked. I always felt the link from art and having friends but that\u2019s as far as it went. It made me part of the world outside of myself.\u201d Callahan credits his wife \u2013 now a therapist \u2013 with helping him to open up. \u201cShe says honesty is the most interesting thing.\u201d Previously, Callahan believed the opposite, plus he wanted to protect his intimates. \u201cAnd I wanted people to listen unbiased. If someone tells you: \u2018My wife just got hit by a car and died, here\u2019s my song about that\u2019, then you\u2019re probably gonna cry no matter how not-good it is. But if you just hear a song, Here\u2019s a Song About My Wife Getting Hit By a Car and Dying, it has to be good or people aren\u2019t gonna listen.\u201d He admits to indulging the myth of the tortured artist in his 20s, even though he wasn\u2019t tortured at all. \u201cMusic was everything to me, and that in itself is kind of a torture,\u201d he says. Callahan released Smog\u2019s debut album, Sewn to the Sky, in 1990. By halfway through the decade, melody was squeezing the rancour out of his early material; by 2001, he reached a purple patch, writing classics such as Dress Sexy at My Funeral, and admitting, on Held, \u201cFor the first time in my life / I let myself be held / Like a big old baby\u201d. By 2005, Callahan was reborn. \u201cI\u2019m new here,\u201d he sang on a song later covered by Gil Scott-Heron. \u201cWill you show me around?\u201d His droll writing reached towards nature, gratitude and other replenishing forces, yet was never saccharine or preachy. Here was a man who, you believed, had figured things out \u2013 with help from the dub icon and personal hero Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry. \u201cI read this quote where he said: \u2018I wanna make superhero music. My music is for the good, it vanquishes evil.\u2019 I was like: \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s make music that is full of goodness.\u2019\u201d He found the transition easy. \u201cIf I have a superpower \u2013 heh! \u2013 it is that I am very flexible. I am constantly absorbing new ways of looking at life but still maintaining the seeds of who I am. I hunger for being proven wrong or directed in a different way.\u201d Searching for goodness, he says, is simple. \u201cIn your daily life, you can focus on the person who cuts you off in traffic, or you can focus on how beautiful the blue sky is when the person cuts you off in traffic. Everything was there before us and we choose what to focus on.\u201d The new album\u2019s Morning Is My Godmother expands this Zen outlook, extolling sunrise as a rejuvenating force. \u201cThe sun is a drug that your tolerance never builds up for,\u201d he says. He stresses that he is not \u201cgazing out my eastern window with a cup of chai \u2013 I\u2019ve got shit to do\u201d. And his sunrise soundtrack is as likely to be nihilistic SoundCloud rap (\u201cI can\u2019t stop looking through that window\u201d) as Terry Riley. \u201cBut the fact that morning bothered to come imbues me with the energy to get the day rolling. Every day is a new day and I feel this sense of protection in the mornings, and potential.\u201d He exhales: \u201cLoving, I guess.\u201d The outlook has more practical applications. His mother died of cancer in May 2018. Callahan says her passing strengthened the peace with which he had written about death in the intervening decade. He saw every stage of her illness, and they spent her last week together. \u201cTo watch someone die is awful but beautiful,\u201d he says. He likens it to his wife giving birth: \u201cI felt I was at a gate where life is becoming death and death is becoming life.\u201d On the new album\u2019s 747, he returns to flight to distil these moments of mundanity meeting profundity. \u201cThat feeling on the airplane when the sun is coming through the windows; that\u2019s the closest thing I could relate it to, in my past experience,\u201d he says. The contentment on Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest is understated yet overwhelming. Does Callahan worry that the more he has to live for, the more he has to lose? Sometimes, he says, and then he reaches for a transcendent feeling that he hasn\u2019t figured out how to express yet. \u201cI can\u2019t die,\u201d he says. \u201cLife is too good. It can\u2019t end. I don\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t wanna leave these people or these places. It\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d What he means, he thinks, is that you can confront death by giving up or by working towards it. \u201cAs long as you keep doing that work, then death makes sense and is a relief.\u201d I fumble for a theory: perhaps the reason listeners have perceived him as intimidating is because his recent work \u2013 not least Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest \u2013 has felt so connected to some greater truth that it is hard to countenance the idea that he is subject to the same impulses as the rest of us; that perhaps all enlightenment takes is for us to stop resisting. \u201cHmm!\u201d he says. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a very interesting and nice thing to say. I hope people can let themselves be happy.\u201d And he chuckles, and makes you believe it\u2019s that easy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
