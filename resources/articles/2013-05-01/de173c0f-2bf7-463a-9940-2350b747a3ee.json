In minute 82, James Vaughan shot the equaliser, which was all the terriers required, and despair hit the Barnsley end. But it gave way to joy as word came that Crystal Palace had knocked in an 89th minute goal that condemned Peterborough to the drop instead. Described by Engels as the most handsome town in the north, Huddersfield displayed all its nobility on the pitch, by allowing the Barnsley keeper to dribble his ball around his box unchallenged, and off it \u2013 fans at both ends chanted \"Yorkshire!\" in unison. After Richard III was rescued from under that Leicester car park, just maybe the House of York is ready to rise as one again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
