The private member's bill stands almost no chance of becoming law, but taps into a debate ignited by the decision to commit troops to Iraq almost exactly two years ago. Then, under pressure from backbenchers but under no procedural obligation, Tony Blair called a debate and vote on invading Iraq. Although the result would not have been binding, the prime minister revealed later that he would have resigned had he not won support for his commitment to back an American invasion. Today a bill by Labour backbencher Neil Gerrard would see it enshrined in law that a prime minister could no longer use royal prerogative alone to commit the country to war. Mr Gerrard, MP for Walthamstow in east London and an opponent of the Iraq war, said his bill would not tie the prime minister's hand in the event of a conflict, but would alert the public to the powers conferred solely upon that office. He told the BBC: \"This is one of the most important decisions that can possibly be made by government and a decision which ought to be made by parliament. Certainly, parliament ought to have a say.\" \"The prime minister himself said [after the Iraq vote] that it would be difficult to imagine in future a prime minister authorising the use of force without the backing of parliament. \"This bill would mean that no future prime minister could ignore that precedent.\" Although the issue may seem esoteric, it could again come to the fore if the US decided to take military action against Iran. Late last year the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, told BBC Radio 4'sToday programme that UK involvement against Tehran was \"inconceivable\", but when the prime minister was challenged directly by former minister Michael Meacher on the subject last week at prime minister's questions, he declined to give a direct answer on joining a US-led attack on Iran, saying instead that he knew of no plans by the US to take such action. Clauses in Mr Gerrard's bill make it clear that parliamentary approval would not be required for every deployment of UK armed forces, for instance in small-scale peacekeeping operations. And the MP says it would not prevent troops from defending themselves if attacked. The move comes ahead of the weekend meeting of Labour Against the War, which will see MPs, trade unionists and activists debate their position on the Iraq elections and the end of the occupation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
