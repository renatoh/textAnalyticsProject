All this new programming will be available not only to digital viewers but to refresh CBBC 1 and 2. This programming will be entirely British.\" On the success or otherwise of The Saturday Show: \"I have always said, based on my experience of commissioning SMTV, that The Saturday Show will take time to evolve. The show has improved in performance terms significantly over the last six months and SMTV is 10 share points down year on year. However, there is still a lot of work to do. I think the new presenters on ITV are great but Ant and Dec are a hard act to follow.\" On the BBC's decision to spend millions on marketing its new digital channels: \"[We have spent] approximately \u00a33m. It is important that we communicate new services to the audience especially in a media landscape that is as complex as the current one. Therefore I think the publicising of the two new channels is important.\" On whether TV channels aimed at children will drive digital take-up: \"I believe by extending choice with a broad programme remit including news, drama and entertainment, we are offering something new and different, which may well attract people that have so far found the offering for children too animation based.\" On which programmes will stand the test of time: \"As well as Teletubbies and Tweenies, I think you could add Bob the Builder, the new Andy Pandy and two shows that I have just commissioned, Finders and Flip Flops. However, I think it is important each generation has its own iconic programming. \"Both Newsround and Blue Peter are unique, not just for their longevity but for the quality of production and editorial remit. I honestly could not predict at this stage that any show will run as long, but I would put money that both Newsround and Blue Peter will still be going strong [in another 40 years].\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
