It isn\u2019t hard to find. \u201cHe seemed about 60 when he was 18,\u201d says John Herety, who managed Carthy in his first two years as a professional. \u201cThe oldest 26-year-old in the world,\u201d says Tom Southam, directeur sportif at Carthy\u2019s EF Education squad. \u201cHe\u2019s seemed like a weathered, seasoned professional since he was young.\u201d Carthy has a distinctive style on his bike due to his height \u2013 1.93m is unusually tall for a cyclist \u2013 and he is different off it. He is more happy talking about snooker or darts than cycling, and is \u201cset in his ways\u201d, say those close to him. \u201cHe has real sangfroid,\u201d says Southam. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to convince him of things, say that one handlebar might be faster than another,\u201d adds Herety. When the first stage of the Vuelta finished at the Arrate sanctuary on 20 October, the laconic, lanky Lancastrian already looked like a probable contender for the podium, finishing in an elite group of eight behind the race favourite and stage winner Primoz Roglic. As the race wended its way through northern Spain from one tough summit finish to the next, he moved to within 18sec of the race lead at one point, pushing both Roglic and his main challenger Richard Carapaz hard at times. The moment that marked Carthy as a possible winner came last Sunday at the Alto de l\u2019Angliru, seen by many as the toughest climb in cycling thanks to its interminable succession of slopes over 20% as it ascends 4,000 feet in just under eight miles. With the field reduced to walking pace at times, Carthy hauled his frame to the summit first, and he backed that up with fourth in Tuesday\u2019s time trial to go into the final phase third overall, within close reach of Roglic\u2019s race lead. Carthy\u2019s climbing ability has been obvious since 2006, when he rode up Mont Ventoux on a scaled-down professional bike with his policeman father, Sean, behind him in the family car, achieving a time for one of cycling\u2019s toughest mountains that would have delighted an adult amateur. As an under-16 he was not suited to the circuit races that make up the British national series, but he won the junior Tour of Wales \u2013 the toughest under-18 race in Britain \u2013 in 2012, after which Herety and the JLT-Condor team came calling. \u201cHe was shy and gangling like he is now,\u201d said Herety. \u201cBut he\u2019d won a junior stage race in the US. I signed him for his ability to time-trial\u201d, Carthy had already gone below 20min for 10 miles, \u201cbecause being a climber and a time-trialist is an unusual combination.\u201d After JLT, Carthy moved to the Spanish Caja Rural team, with whom he won the Tour of Asturias in 2016 before moving to EF. \u201cHe\u2019s been allowed to work away, bubble under,\u201d says Southam. \u201cThere\u2019s always been 100% belief that Hugh would get to a high level, and he was smart enough to realise that at another team he might have fallen into another role.\u201d The signs were there when Carthy rode his first Tour de France in September. On stage two into Nice, his teammate Dani Mart\u00ednez had a puncture just as the favourites were unleashed for the finish; it was Carthy who brought the Colombian back to the front against the odds. Five days later, when Mart\u00ednez won the stage at Puy Mary, it was Carthy who pulled his teammate up to the race-winning break, and snuck into seventh on the stage. In 2014, aged 19, Carthy won the Tour of Korea for JLT, where Southam was working at the time. Two episodes stuck out. On one stage Carthy got a puncture a few metres outside the 3km-to-go flag but had the presence of mind to wait until he was within the 3km mark before raising his arm to ask for a spare wheel. That meant even if he was unable to regain contact he would be given the same time as the stage winner. It was the kind of nous that a seasoned professional would show, not a teenager. \u201cAnother day we were going up the finish climb, and he sat up, dropped to the back of the group and took his gloves off. I was like: \u2018What does he think he\u2019s doing\u2019, but he stuffed the gloves in his pocket, changed to a higher gear and just destroyed them. He had been checking the other riders out. At 19, he was already showing the ability to think on the bike under pressure you see in more mature riders.\u201d It was a classic case of old head, young shoulders; in this Vuelta, Carthy has finally fulfilled that early promise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
