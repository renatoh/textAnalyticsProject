Based on historical events that mostly took place between the ninth and early 11th centuries, they have been narrated in the farmsteads of Iceland since the Middle Ages. J\u00fal\u00edusson performs the Icelandic Sagas Greatest Hits in Reykjav\u00edk, a comedy version in both Icelandic and English of all 40 of the \u201cfamily sagas\u201d \u2013 tales of feuding, romance, surprisingly intricate legal processes, sorcery and sea battles. \u201cWe are constantly reminded of these stories,\u201d he told me, \u201cand we name children after characters in them.\u201d The sagas are the record of how Iceland was settled by refugees and migrants from (mainly) Scandinavia: how they divided the land, established clans and family alliances, built their own legal system and ditched the old Norse gods for Christianity. So high are passions around these stories that, in the wake of Iceland\u2019s independence in 1944, the repatriation of the original saga manuscripts from Denmark became a matter of diplomatic urgency. After much wrangling, these medieval calf-skin parchment started to be returned from 1971: the Danish navy frigate that carried back the first vellum was greeted by flag-waving crowds in Reykjav\u00edk harbour. Travelling the routes of the sagas took me all over Iceland, but some episodes are easier to place than others. When it comes to the popular Grettir\u2019s Saga, I wasn\u2019t confident about emulating the cantankerous hero\u2019s battles with a ghoul and a she-troll, but there was one fail-safe way to copy his adventures: by getting into hot water. Roaming across northern Iceland, I hiked from the port town of Sau\u00f0\u00e1rkr\u00f3kur, past sheep farms and pony fields, and slid into a stone-lined \u201chot-pot\u201d at Grettislaug, warm with volcanically heated water, where the medieval hero is said to have bathed. \u201cIt\u2019s a true story,\u201d insisted the site manager, Ingi, who periodically dips a thermometer to check the temperature. \u201cAnd we still read it, even now!\u201d Behind the bath, campers bustled in a wooden kitchen and set up their equipment between the webbing of guy-ropes, ready to capture the northern lights as soon as the early evening cloud caul dispersed. I set up my tent alongside them. Landscape plays a major role in Icelandic sagas. Hitch-hiking across the west of the country, I crossed dramatic plains of lava rock mantled in moss that feature in the Eyrbyggja Saga. In the tale, a farmer sets his antagonists the task of building a pass through the lava plain, expecting them to fail \u2013 when they succeed, he murders them in a bath house. I made my way down to the fishing port of Borgarnes, where a museum has been opened in honour of the popular Egil\u2019s Saga, with scenes from the tale reimagined using recycled fishing gear. And I rambled around the windswept hills and heaths of Laxardal, where the sagas\u2019 greatest heroine, Gu\u00f0run, experiences some of the many reverses of her tumultuous life. Sometimes I wild camped, pitching my tent by roadsides and on the edges of fields, but mostly I stayed in campsites, which are plentiful in Iceland (and often well-equipped with kitchens and electricity hook-ups). In the Laxd\u00e6la Saga, Gu\u00f0run ends her life on Helgafell, the \u201csacred mountain\u201d. As I hitched there, I was scooped out of rain squalls by a Polish hotel worker and then by a local goose hunter, whose automatic rifle bounced on the back seat. From the main road where I was dropped off, the mountain loomed behind pastures and peat bogs, its shape suggesting a burial mound, as if it were sculpted to evoke the many pagan heroes it reportedly entombed, before being rebranded as Christian Iceland\u2019s most hallowed place. Here, Gu\u00f0run became \u201cthe first woman in Iceland to become a nun and anchoress\u201d, according to the saga. At the foot of the seamy mountain, a rock is engraved with Gu\u00f0run\u2019s most famous saying: \u201cTo him I was worst who I loved best.\u201d A path winds between bushels of crowberry and spongy moss, and wind roars across the hilltop like a Nordic god on a day trip from Valhalla. The panoramic scale is breathtaking \u2013 lakes and marshland, skerries (rocky islets) brooding in the firth, drumlins powdered with glacial flour, pastures dotted with sheep. Downhill from the mountain, a church spikes over a graveyard, where the heroine\u2019s name is inscribed under welts of lichen on the tomb traditionally ascribed to her. \u201cThe greatest saga is Nj\u00e1l\u2019s Saga,\u201d J\u00fal\u00edusson told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the big one, the one we all know about.\u201d It\u2019s a complicated tale, swinging from sea raids and storm-swept battles to intricately depicted legal depositions. Part of the story takes place at \u00deingvellir, the \u201cfields of parliament\u201d, in the south-west. Here, most of the key national decisions have been made, from the transition to Christianity in 1000AD to the declaration of independence in 1944. After checking out a collision point of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, you can follow the path beside moss-covered lava, down to a lake populated by giant trout (and in the process pass through the Gate of the Moon from the Eyrie in Game of Thrones). A flagpole rises from a ledge credited as the \u201crock of law\u201d, over the natural amphitheatre in which medieval lawyers such as Nj\u00e1l brokered their cases and established the world\u2019s first elected parliament. Nj\u00e1l\u2019s Saga carried me down into the south of Iceland, where the hero, Gunnar, lived. In the tale, his sharp-tongued wife Hallgerda bickers with her neighbours, and sends her slaves on missions of theft and murder, and Gunnar is embroiled in feuds until he is decreed an exile. But stumbling from his horse on his way to his ship, he looks back upon the beautiful countryside he\u2019s about to leave behind. \u201cFair is the Lithe,\u201d he declares in the saga\u2019s most iconic speech, \u201cso fair that it has never seemed to me so fair; the corn fields are white to harvest, and the home mead is mown; and now I will ride back home, and not fare abroad at all.\u201d Hiking under black-bellied storm clouds, I tramped past Gunnar\u2019s Rock, a knobbly riverside prominence where he fought off an ambush. Above bristling fields soars \u00der\u00edhyrningur (Three Peak Mountain), plunging down to slopes of tuff stone. Beyond an icy river, a path winds between beryl-green hills and waterfalls, an area known locally as Flosi\u2019s dale, after one of the tale\u2019s antagonists. I slept that night in a hoop of corrugated iron next to a church, and woke to a chorus of snipe. This was Gunnar\u2019s home, Hli\u00f0arendi; wandering under whipped-cream clouds and riffling geese, past the gleaming plunge-lines of waterfalls towards the ice-capped volcano of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, I could appreciate why Gunnar resolved to stay \u2013 though the decision cost him his life. About 20 miles further south \u2013 reached thanks to lifts from a huntsman in search of ptarmigan and a Scottish knitwear designer with a 4x4 \u2013 was Berg\u00de\u00f3rsvoll, home of the lawyer Nj\u00e1l. There isn\u2019t much to see, but there is a guesthouse with communal kitchen (doubles from \u00a360 room-only), which provided a rare treat \u2013 a night indoors \u2013 to end my saga journey. Sheep graze the fields, there are a few goats and a horse paddock. The area is still known for its feuds. \u201cThis place is cursed,\u201d one local told me, describing some recent conflicts. \u201cWe call it a war zone,\u201d her partner added. The flat, grassy fields with their close access to the sea would have made for prime medieval real estate, and the same natural advantages remain. In the saga, the house is burned, Nj\u00e1l is killed and his son-in-law, Kari, sets off in search of revenge. The saga, however, manages to conjure a more hopeful ending, with reconciliation and marriage between the feuding factions. Iceland now boasts one of the world\u2019s lowest crime rates, but these violent tales still resonate, partly for their drama and partly because they reflect the threat of violence underlying all our societies. The ghosts of the past continue to haunt this storied land, its rivers and hillsides, its dramatic mountains and its surreal lava plains. \u2022 Nicholas Jubber\u2019s new book, Epic Continent: Adventures in the Great Stories of Europe, is published by John Murray, \u00a320.
