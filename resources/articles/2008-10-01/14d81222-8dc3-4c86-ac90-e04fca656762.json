In an echo of the New Deal in the 1930s, Obama proposed embarking on programmes to repair bridges, roads, schools and other infrastructure projects that have been on hold for decades. To provide immediate relief for struggling families he suggested allowing people to dip into their retirement funds and imposing a three-month moratorium on mortgage foreclosures. Obama said his plan should be implemented immediately and would not have to wait until a new president takes over on January 20. The Democratic candidate was seeking to command the issue that could decide the election. Neither he nor McCain have yet put forward solutions to the crisis that have resonated with voters. Analysts say the first candidate to do so will hold the key to victory. Obama announced his plan, which was worked out over the past few weeks with a battery of former US treasury staff and other advisers, in what his campaign team called a major economic speech in Toledo, Ohio. He put the emphasis on creating new jobs after forecasts of 8% unemployment by the end of the year. \"It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everyone's mind, and it's spelled J-O-B-S,\" he said, urging the White House and Congress to implement his plans immediately. \"We can't wait to help workers and families and communities who are struggling right now - who don't know if their job or their retirement will be there tomorrow; who don't know if next week's pay cheque will cover this month's bills. \"We need to pass an economic rescue plan for the middle class and we need to do it now. Today, I'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilise our financial system, provide relief to families and communities, and help struggling homeowners.\" To help create jobs, Obama proposed a $3,000 job tax credit for every new employee a company takes on over the next two years. He said 1m new jobs could be saved by creating a fund to provide money to states and local communities to rebuild and repair roads, bridges, schools and other infrastructure projects. In a rare acknowledgement of a good idea from the opposing camp, Obama, appealing to independents who tend to dislike partisan politics, welcomed McCain's plan for changing pension regulations so that people are not penalised by low stock market prices. \"I think that's a good idea, but I think we need to do even more,\" Obama said. His plan to allow people to raid their pension funds would allow families to \"get through this crisis without being forced to make painful choices like selling their homes or not sending their kids to college\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
