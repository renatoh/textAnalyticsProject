On 30 May 1984, Arthur Scargill's arrest outside the Orgreave coking plant was carefully orchestrated. Four consecutive days of successful picketing had effectively closed the plant. The police decided that the only way to break the line was to make a number of exemplary arrests. The news that the president of the NUM himself was to be at Orgreave on the fifth day was greeted at police headquarters with unrestrained delight. On his arrival, a friendly photographer told Scargill that if he refused to \"move on\" he was sure to be arrested. He stood firm and embraced his fate. The result was one of the totemic pictures of the strike \u2013 Scargill, each arm pinioned by a police offer, the unrepentant martyr on his way to jail. Whatever effect it had on the morale of the striking miners, the photograph of Scargill's arrest did less to win support from the public than a picture of a grinning picket wearing the sort of comedy police helmet on sale in shops along Blackpool's Golden Mile. Little else helped the miners' cause. The goodwill that they traditionally enjoyed had been sacrificed \u2013 as had the chances of winning an entirely justified dispute \u2013 by the NUM's indefensible decision not to ballot its members before the strike began. Outside mining areas, antagonism \u2013 more against Scargill himself than his members \u2013 encouraged scepticism about police brutality and the manufacture of evidence against peaceful pickets. Both claims were undoubtedly justified. The only issue in doubt is who was to blame: the South Yorkshire force or reinforcements from outside the county, or both. Twenty-five years on, one senior South Yorkshire officer told me that, at the height of the strike, he was on the point of demanding that visiting officers from the Metropolitan police be sent home. They had arrived, he said, proclaiming that they were \"up for it\" and demonstrated the meaning of that expression by intentionally antagonising the pickets. When their coaches passed through lines of striking miners they waved five pound notes \u2013 the reward for the overtime that policing the strike required, and an irresistible provocation to miners whose families were barely able to buy groceries. They boasted in public houses about what a joy it was to \"sort out the Commies\" and, flaunting their swollen pay packets, made overtures \u2013 often distressingly successful \u2013 to local girls. Traditionally Yorkshire miners enjoyed a friendly relationship with the local police. Between the wars, the Guards found the county a fruitful recruitment area, as young men trod the well-worn path from colliery, via five years with the colours, to constabulary. And in mining areas, old loyalties endure. My maternal grandfather moved straight from pit to police in Derbyshire. Most miners had a distant relative in the force. During the 1984 dispute, there was at least one inspector who would meet (and greet) his brother on the picket line. That does not mean that \u2013 in the polarised atmosphere of 1984 \u2013 no South Yorkshire officer transgressed. The circumstances and conduct of the dispute made almost anything possible. But whoever was responsible, the undoubted malpractices only add another element to the tragedy. The miners were right. Margaret Thatcher did want to break the NUM and close down the mining industry. The paradox is that the union's tactics ensured that she would succeed. Roy Hattersley was deputy leader of the Labour party during the miners' strike."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
