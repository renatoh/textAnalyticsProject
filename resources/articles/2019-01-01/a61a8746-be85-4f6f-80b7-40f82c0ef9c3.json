As Ben\u00edtez prepared to welcome a team from Old Trafford under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s interim care to Tyneside on Wednesday night he reflected on the fine line separating debilitating negativity and necessary realism. Whereas a less than diplomatic approach to management helped cost Mourinho his job and arguably prompted Manchester United\u2019s players to underachieve, Newcastle\u2019s manager feels there is still a time and a place for delivering some home truths in the right manner. Eyebrows were raised when he recently declared his team would require \u201ca miracle\u201d to avoid relegation but Ben\u00edtez had no worries about his players\u2019 reaction to that ostensibly rather bleak message. Whereas he made it plain he thinks Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s squad is good enough to be competing with Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the table, Newcastle\u2019s first team cannot afford to start imagining they are even half as talented. \u201cThe relationship between my players and myself is quite open and honest,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez, who thinks his squad overachieved by finishing 10th last season. \u201cI\u2019m telling them what I think and I\u2019m telling them if we want to stay up we need to work so hard. \u201cEveryone, players, staff, everyone, has to realise it is so difficult for us. We are competing against the best teams in the world, who are spending massive money and if we think we are better than we are it is a mistake. The table is tight and it\u2019s not easy. The top teams can punish you. The proof is when we play at home with 52,000 fans we are not winning as much as we want. Why? It\u2019s the Premier League and our level is our level. I can say the truth to my players and they understand easily what I\u2019m trying to say.\u201d Indeed Newcastle have won only twice at St James\u2019 Park, which largely explains why they are sitting awkwardly close to the bottom three. Manchester United may be stuck in sixth place, 19 points adrift of the leaders, Liverpool, but their hopes of European qualification remain very much alive and Ben\u00edtez dismissed suggestions they are no longer a team to be feared. Instead he made it clear that a squad as richly gifted \u2013 not to mention expensively assembled \u2013 should have been comfortably in the top four under the guidance of his old rival Mourinho. \u201cDo you think the players that they have after spending the money they did are bad players?\u201d said Ben\u00edtez, whose club made a \u00a320m transfer market profit last summer. \u201cThey are good players, they performed in the last three games [under Solskj\u00e6r] \u2013 it is a very good team. \u201cIt is a team that easily has to be in the top four, that is very clear. They can compete against anyone; Liverpool, Manchester City, anyone. We are talking about one of the biggest clubs in the world. The players they have, the names they have. They are so good, if you want to get points against them, if you want to win against them you have to perform really, really well. It\u2019s a massive game for us.\u201d After three wins against Cardiff, Huddersfield and Bournemouth there is a theory that Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side may start to feel the pressure of increased expectations but Ben\u00edtez demurred. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who the manager is now, they have good players and that is the main thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be dangerous. I don\u2019t think they will feel more pressure than before. They have good players and, for sure, they will try their best and they are used to pressure.\u201d Although he was careful to keep his comments superficially opaque, Newcastle\u2019s manager could not resist the temptation to taking another between-the-lines swipe at Mourinho. \u201cIf you are a top side like Manchester United and spend millions each year you have to be in the top four and win the title. That is the pressure they are feeling now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
