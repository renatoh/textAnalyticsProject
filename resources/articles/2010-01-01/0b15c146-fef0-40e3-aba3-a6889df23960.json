He had turned up, on duty, to a Frankie Boyle gig, only to find himself seated \u2013 horror of horrors! \u2013 in the front row. Throughout the evening, Boyle duly worked his way from one hapless row A punter to another, abusing them all. \"What's your job?\" the assassination would begin. \"What do you do?\" The critic cowered, like a Christian awaiting the lions, thinking: \"How the hell do I answer?\" How indeed? He might try, \"I'm a comedy reviewer, Mr Boyle,\" and hope that Mock the Week's former attack dog, rather than scenting blood, goes all puppyish at his fearless honesty. Or he could lie, inventing the unfunniest profession imaginable, and trust the stormclouds would soon blow over. But what if his bluff was called? This, surely, would be a comedian's field day \u2013 and the critic's nightmare. \"You're not a dog-walker: you're Brian Logan from the Guardian. And now you're mine, all mine . . . !\" (Cue maniacal cackle.) Of course, comedians probably have as little desire to interact with critics mid-gig as we do with them. But who knows? In the interests of disguise, I am as furtive with my notebook as a prison visitor is with the file in his cake. I have almost perfected the art of writing on it while it's still in my bag. But are my tactics working? At a Pappy's Fun Club show a while back, I was singled out \u2013 horror of further horrors! \u2013 for what is benignly known as audience participation. I prefer the term \"extraordinary rendition\". Concealing my notebook did nothing to prevent my being press-ganged, and made to play non-existent drums in a mimed rock band. Might this have been averted had I deployed the notepad publicly, in self-defence, like garlic against a vampire? I can't be certain. In the meantime, I'll keep practising note-taking-by-stealth. And if Frankie Boyle asks, tell him that the man with the twitching bag on his lap is just another thoroughly unfunny accountant.
