That is until the voltage is cranked up again for Saturday's visit of Queens Park Rangers to Molineux. Those are the trials and tribulations of being manager of Wolves these days but at least Jones will have slept easier in his bed last night, despite the club's chief executive Jez Moxey's announcement in the club programme that Wolves are \"prepared to make whatever changes are necessary\" for them to achieve their objective of returning to the Premiership this season. That still seems a long way off, despite Wolves climbing out of the bottom three with their first home win of the season, but Jones has cause for renewed optimism now that he has apparently found the solution to nerves from the penalty spot. Six others had tried and failed until Cooper became lucky number seven following a defining moment just after the quarter-hour which also led to the dismissal of Lee Camp, the Derby goalkeeper. Jones joked that he was appealing for a free-kick on the edge of the area and not a penalty as the referee Dermot Gallagher had little alternative but to show a straight red card to the England Under-21 international, but the Derby manager George Burley was incensed at an earlier offside that went undetected when Colin Cameron burst on to Kenny Miller's overhead pass before he was fouled. \"I have no complaints with the red card but Cameron was four yards offside.\" Cooper certainly eased the tension from 12 yards. That released the shackles and it was fitting that Cooper, one of Jones' most loyal servants, completed a night of personal triumph with a curling free-kick early in the second half. It also brought a smile back to the face of Jones, who has been under intense scrutiny and will remain so. \"I drove into the game and I read all the billboards saying it was D-Day. That means Saturday will be E-Day,\" said Jones. Whether he reaches Z remains to be seen. One suspects that if he gets that far, Moxey will have no reason to make personnel changes and Wolves may well achieve their goal after all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
