Welcome back to the day job, Jarvis. When Pulp announced in November that they were reuniting after almost a decade, a little preparation was required. Jarvis Cocker revealed that the band were relearning their songs by watching cover versions on YouTube. They invited fans to upload their interpretations of the hits to pulppeople.com. The result? A celebration of dippy fandom. From the kooky Spanish cover of Common People on ukulele and xylophone \u2013 filmed in a market to the bemusement of shoppers buying fruit and veg, to the uncanny Jarvis imitations, the global contributions show the excitement which the return of one of the greatest British bands has generated. \"Is this a hoax?\" was the question posed by words projected onto the curtain covering the stage at Barcelona's Primavera Sound festival. Waiting in the crowd at the futuristic Parc del F\u00f2rum for Pulp's first concert since 2002, it was an irresistible suspicion. And, at 1.45 on Saturday morning, the curtain of cryptic questions was swept away before an audience bristling with anticipation. Cocker, resplendent in suit and tie announced, 'Tonight we are going to make history.' As the opening notes of Do You Remember The First Time? began and a singalong broke out, it really felt like they might. In his break from the band Cocker may have struggled to remember some of the songs but he never forgot his twitching, pouty dance moves. By the second song, Pink Glove, he was clambering on to rigs, gasping and crooning into the crowd, his imposing stage presence accentuated by a pair of impressively wedged shoes. Ever the charmer, he asked the audience's permission to remove his jacket and tie while sipping red wine. The rest of the band eschews such showmanship but it's evident how happy they are to be back on stage, doing what they do best. Formed in 1978, Pulp rose to fame in the Britpop era, although their caustic observations and melancholy lyricism set them apart from their more youthful, sometimes yob-like chartmates. At Pulp's peak in 1995, Different Class spent 64 weeks in the album charts and saw a last-minute Glastonbury set which is still hailed as one of the best performances in the festival's history. Since 2002, however, Pulp have never shown an interest in reforming. On Thursday guitarist Mark Webber told BBC 6 Music that the reunion \u2013 the classic Pulp lineup of Cocker, Webber, Nick Banks, Candida Doyle, Steve MacKey and Russell Senior \u2013 was prompted by the death of a mutual friend and the realisation that opportunities should be taken while they are still possible. Although any band can make political statements, it was a poignant touch that the anthem Common People was dedicated to the unarmed protesters beaten and shot at with rubber bullets in the city's Pla\u00e7a de Catalu\u00f1a last week . They kept their promise to play fan favourites, and performed them with an assuredness gained from years of live experience, the forceful bass and undulating synth driving tracks such as Babies and Disco 2000 to dizzying heights. Of all the songs only Sorted For E's &amp; Wizz sounded dated; clearly 90s rave culture was left behind in a field in Hampshire. However, it is only a great band that is asked to officiate a marriage proposal. Carrying a mini camera, Jarvis left the stage for the front row where he asked Shane and Michelle from Athens, Georgia, to introduce themselves. He then told Michelle that Shane had something to ask her, filming it on his camera for the audience to see. A ring was produced, a yes was pronounced, Jarvis got back onto the stage and launched into Underwear. It's all in a day's work. Dripping with sweat as they closed with Razzmatazz Cocker thanked the crowd for being \"so gentle and responsive\", revealing that they had been nervous before coming on stage. Pulp don't promise any new songs, and there are no plans to tour: they are simply a band having fun doing what they want to do, and they've earned the right to do it. They've warmed up nicely for shows in the UK. Their next gig is the Isle of Wight festival on the 11 June. They then play the Wireless Festival and T in The Park before Reading and Leeds on the August bank holiday. These summer shows might not be quite all Pulp have to offer, especially if they continue to receive such a rapturous reception, but make the most of them now \u2013 otherwise you might have to wait another 10 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
