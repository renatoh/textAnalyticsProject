The US president outflanked and outspent rival Hillary Clinton on the web in 2016 and, after three years building a sophisticated digital operation with a formidable war chest, will enjoy a head start over next year\u2019s challenger. It is a marked reversal of fortunes from a decade ago when young liberals ruled the internet and Obama\u2019s revolutionary approach to online organizing helped him to victories over Clinton and the Republican nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney. Michael Slaby, the Obama campaign\u2019s chief technology officer in 2008 and chief integration and innovation officer in 2012, said: \u201cThe difficult truth about the pace of media and technology evolution is that it doesn\u2019t sit still so, if you\u2019re not continuously investing, you\u2019re falling behind, and I think there was a bit of a moment on the left of, \u2018Hey, we won, we figured this out. We\u2019re great at this,\u2019 that gave us a little bit of overconfidence. \u201cThere were some huge, very thoughtful and intelligent efforts on the right in 2013 to address weaknesses, catch up, do smart things and build data trust and build Breitbart and all these different projects. We have some really interesting, profoundly powerful organising groups that have cropped up post-2016 like Arena and Organizing Corps and Run for Something and Swing Left. They\u2019re very focused on organising; I\u2019m not saying that in a disparaging way. What they are not, though, is infrastructure. \u201cThere is an overdue need for a reimagining and rethinking, a modernizing of the underlying infrastructure on the left that hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d The centrality of tech to the president\u2019s re-election effort is spelled out by his choice of campaign manager: Brad Parscale, who was digital director in 2016 and \u2013 bearded, 6ft 8in tall \u2013 is now a familiar warm-up act at Trump\u2019s rallies. A year from the election, he is already spending millions of dollars more than Democrats to \u201cflood the zone\u201d of social media every day. The Trump 2020 campaign serves up targeted adverts with often misleading messages about immigration, impeachment and other issues that would be rejected by traditional TV networks. It has mastered incendiary clickbait as a tool to pour oil on supporters\u2019 grievances, bank their donations, sell them merchandise and absorb their data. Washington norms are inverted online. The biggest political crisis of Trump\u2019s presidency is translated into an \u201cimpeachment defense task force\u201d to fire up supporters and tap their wallets. Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s recent comment to reporters, \u201cGet over it\u201d, widely seen as a politically costly gaffe, quickly manifested itself as a slogan on a must-have T-shirt. Some Democrats worry their response so far is analogue and anaemic. Candidates\u2019 primary campaigns are seen as less innovative, less targeted and less ruthless about data collection and, for now at least, no match for Trump\u2019s firepower. Former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has even shifted funds from online advertising to the traditional medium of TV, the New York Times reported. The lost ground could be seen as an aspect of how, even as Obama occupied the White House for two terms, inertia set in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the party endured sweeping defeats in the Senate, House of Representatives and various governerships while losing nearly 1,000 state legislative seats. Slaby, 42, now chief strategist of the not-for-profit Harmony Labs, said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing. It\u2019s always unfortunate to lose a lead out of a lack of humility. A lot has been made about President Obama\u2019s party-building leadership during his administration and what happened, or didn\u2019t happen, at the DNC in that decade. I think there\u2019s some blame there. We could have been making those investments in those years and we didn\u2019t. \u201cBut those investments are available to us any time. We can pick the ball up at any moment. It\u2019s not like, \u2018Oh, we missed a shot, let\u2019s all rub gravel through our hair and blame everybody else.\u2019 That\u2019s not useful. But yes, it frustrates me, I think we\u2019re missing opportunities, and ultimately I find it frustrating because it makes us less effective as leaders and that makes our civic life as a country less vibrant, and that makes me mad.\u201d In the past week Facebook has resisted pressure to ban political advertising, even when it contains lies, earning a rebuke from Clinton and others. Twitter subsequently announced it would refuse such ads and was met by sharp criticism from the Trump camp in turn. Concerns also persist that Facebook, YouTube and other sites could be targets of foreign interference again. But Andrew Bleeker, who led digital advertising on the Obama campaigns, is less pessimistic about where Democrats currently stand. \u201cI think some of the things that have led to a narrative around \u2018one group is woefully behind\u2019 or \u2018dramatically ahead\u2019 are a little bit exaggerated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of comparing apples to oranges in points in time.\u201d The Trump campaign does enjoy the hefty advantage of incumbency, he acknowledged, and can make long-term investments to build infrastructure and gather email addresses and cellphone numbers. Democrats are facing a competitive primary and so face different objectives and time horizons. \u201cWhere I think there\u2019s a real risk are things where time is really going to matter. It\u2019s going to matter on the size of the audiences that these campaigns have been able to build. Trump does have a huge head start there. It\u2019s not sophistication but the depth of his list is gonna be a real thing,\u201d he said. Bleeker, 34, president of communications agency Bully Pulpit Interactive, added: \u201cThere\u2019s also the talent question and these things cut both ways. The Trump campaign, being an incumbent, has the advantage you can build a bigger in-house team or agency teams early. You have more money \u2013 he raised $125m last quarter \u2013 so you can hire whoever you want. The Democratic campaigns will hire later; they\u2019re smaller right now on the whole. \u201cBut on the flip side, one campaign has a larger budget from which to experiment but there are fewer groups experimenting. One of the reasons I\u2019m optimistic about the Democratic primary is that you see a lot of good ideas in primaries. We have a lot of candidates. Only one\u2019s going to win but there\u2019s not only one set of good ideas and innovations. I think a lot of those innovations will make it to the Democratic nominee.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
