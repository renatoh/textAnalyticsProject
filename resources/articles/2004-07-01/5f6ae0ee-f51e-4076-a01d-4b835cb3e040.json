The Michael Bell-trained youngster finished a good fifth in the Queen Mary Stakes on firm going at Royal Ascot last time and as a result of that effort was backed down to 5-4 favourite. She did not let her supporters down, stretching away from David Wachman's Irish raider All Night Dancer inside the final furlong to win by three and a half lengths. Ian Mongan, her rider, said: \"She's a nice filly and always just does enough. We haven't seen the best of her yet. She'll make a real nice three-year-old. \"Her form is rock solid. She ran a cracker in the Queen Mary. It just wasn't really far enough and the ground was quick enough. This is the first time she's had her trip and ground.\" Reflecting on the win, Mongan added: \"I got to work on her three out and I gave her a couple behind the saddle to keep her up to her work, but she's like that. She looked a lot better than the others in the paddock and she deserved that win.\" Connections are now considering a tilt at the Princess Margaret Stakes at Ascot later this month. Make Us Flush put a disappointing run at Pontefract behind her to land a stylish success in the Dalkia &amp; Land Securities Trillium Partnership Maiden Claiming Stakes. Franny Norton sent Alan Berry's juvenile to the front a furlong out and, running on strongly, the 5-1 joint-favourite had two and a half lengths to spare over As Handsome Does."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
