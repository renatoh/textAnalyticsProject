The world outside has rather passed him by. While the capital has been gripped by fear, he has been calmly doing sums and assessing tactics at the company's London base. The terrorist bombs, the arrests around the corner, the interrogation of suspects down the road at Paddington Green have been but distractions. In his view, this is a tribute to London, a city the Anglophile Italian-born chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless knows well and likes a lot (he is not given to the stereotypical Latin over-expression of his emotions by saying, for example, that he loves the place). But he respects it. And he married an Englishwoman. 'I must say,' he says in answer to a question inviting an excitable response about living in the city of terror, 'I am not sure I agree it is a frightened place. It is a city that gets on with life.' How Londonish. And so, London being London people got on with the job, and last week he, his chairman, ex-British Aerospace finance director Richard Lapthorne and the Energis board led by Archie Norman and Freeserve founder John Pluthero, spiced up the traditional August torpor with an \u00a3800 million deal. It was a cracking affair. Since mid-July the City had been waiting. C&amp;W conceded on the 22nd that it was in talks with Energis, the alternative telecoms company spun out of the National Grid in the late Nineties boom that soared and then crashed to earth in a spectacular collapse and debt-for-equity rebirth in 2002. C&amp;W, itself weakened by unsuccessful forays into the US, Japan and the internet, had for two years been seen as the hub around which much needed consolidation in the over-extended telecoms sector would radiate. The Energis deal had analysts filling their spreadsheets with synergies, savings, cuts and enhanced earnings. Then, as negotiations were drawing to a close, arrived a Scottish interloper, Thus, the copycat telco spun out of National Grid rival Scottish Power, mounting a preposterous spoiler, and attempting to disrupt negotiations between C&amp;W, Energis and the 10 hedge funds that owned its restructured debt. Thus, led by Bill Allen, a former C&amp;W executive passed over by Lapthorne in favour of Caio in 2002, was sent packing, and last Tuesday C&amp;W made the announcements. The intrigue brought some of the biggest and wiliest beasts from the City together: Lapthorne, the cerebral, some would say Machiavellian FTSE heavyweight; Norman, the former retail wizard and Tory party chairman; John Pluthero, product of the dotcom boom now a hardened, restructured telco boss and Francesco Caio. Francesco Caio? Who? It turns out not to be an easy question. He is a 'let's go back to the beginning', 'from first principles' kind of conversationalist, in the style, say, of his friend Adair Turner. This is not surprising, given they share McKinsey as an Alma Mater. But then so does Norman, who, in public at least, is rather more chatty. Caio has all the hallmarks of the high flyer: his spell at McKinsey was preceded by a first job as a salesman at Italy's Olivetti, where he returned in 1992, hired by the chairman Carlo de Benedetti to head up telecoms operations. Caio suggested mobile phones might be a market to try and he was given Omnitel to run, which he did successfully, before being brought back to Olivetti in 1995. He also has the scars of the high flyer: he fell out spectacularly with de Benedetti, left the chief executive's suite after three months and got caught up in investigations into false accounting from which he was later exonerated. From Olivetti he went on to run Merloni, the Italian consumer appliance maker, before setting up a communications company Netscalibur, where he stayed until Lapthorne grabbed him to succeed C&amp;W's unloved CEO Graham Wallace. Lapthorne describes him as egoless and Caio's description of the complexities of doing a deal with a board he needed to continue working with (Pluthero will take on UK operations for the new C&amp;W) along with 10 hedge funds while seeing off a late-arriving gatecrasher is studded with references to the chairman. 'We work very effectively together, we have a close relationship. He gave me a clear understanding of how to tackle the various steps in the process, and how to handle the communications and work towards the end of the process.' He describes Lapthorne as 'very experienced in public companies, with a flavour for diversity and an intellectual curiosity that helps him move about'. How does he compare with other chairmen? 'They are all very different. Vittorio Merloni was very much an industrial animal, Carlo de Benedetti was probably more a financier, with good intuition.' Caio talks intriguingly of the delicacy needed in dealing with Pluthero, in particular. 'You have to move from competition to partnership, and all the time you are trying to think of how you are going to build a stronger company out of two parts. The first part was difficult negotiation, that's the very nature of forging a deal.' Now he says, 'we share the visions for this new company'. When Caio was appointed, he raised fears that he was another 'ideas man' ripe for hubris in the mould of Wallace. Now he continues to explain himself in terms of his vision for C&amp;W and the evolving telecoms market, fitting the Energis deal into his strategy. When he took over in the midst of the massive post-Nineties communications glut, he understood the need for a deal. He says there were four attributes a company would need to succeed: scale, ownership of access to a network, getting volume on to that network and working hard on getting the marketing message right. In C&amp;W, still a UK business with a sprawling set of operations from Panama to the Far East, he saw two separate businesses - legacy voice and data operations that were in decline. These had to be managed down and cut back, and growth areas, for example broadband access, in C&amp;W's case for small and medium sized businesses expanded. Caio set about expansion with a series of small investments. In May 2004 he spent \u00a3200m on Bulldog, a broadband access provider with 12,000 business and consumer customers. In September, he put C&amp;W equipment into 400 BT exchanges, allowing him to provide broadband across BT's 'local loop', the last stretch of cable to homes and businesses. This year, he launched C&amp;amp;amp;W's Next Generation Network (NGN), a \u00a3200m, three-year programme to build a new internet-based network by upgrading its existing cables with new switching technology, ready to become number two to BT - itself spending up to \u00a310bn on a new '21st-century network'. The building blocks were in place. But Caio still needed scale. The City could see his strategy did not make sense without it. However, he claims it was not until the NGN proposals were out, and the industry regulator Ofcom published a review that encouraged competition with BT, that he could move. 'Businesses traditionally have not moved their providers. It has not been a very competitive market,' he says. This worked against a deal because the logic - consolidation of two companies into one - was prevented by unwillingness to change among customers. 'What changed everything was the emergence of the new technology. Companies could see there were new solutions on offer, and this made them think about the services they wanted.' This gave C&amp;W the opportunity it was waiting for. And so the deal came. But when it did, the City, as is often the case, was underwhelmed. C&amp;W shares fell, and analysts, hoping for initial savings of \u00a3100m were disappointed with proposed \u00a355m savings next year, rising to \u00a380m in 2007/8, savings that implied 700 job losses. Some could not see much upside. Caio is sanguine. First, he says, cautiously, that he hopes the savings will be higher. Second, he says: 'We are in this for the long term.' So where does he see C&amp;W in five years? He gives a very long and structured answer. 'It boils down to the leader in the technology both in the UK and round the world.' That's what you get from the man from McKinsey.
