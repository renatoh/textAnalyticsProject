That\u2019s not just the wind \u2013 there\u2019s definitely something out there, moving around outside the tent. A lion, perhaps; do they hunt at night? Or a polar bear? I believe they often rip tents apart in order to devour the human occupants. Perhaps it is someone \u2013 a human, a murderer almost certainly. Unless of course it\u2019s just Gatsby, next door\u2019s cat, out on the scrounge again or pooing in our flower bed. Whatever, we\u2019re way too scared to unzip and have a look. We \u2013 my family \u2013 are camping in the garden. I say my family, but it\u2019s just me and the boys, eight and six. Their mum started off with us, but she disappeared after bedtime stories. Her words on leaving the tent? \u201cI\u2019m just going inside; I may be some time.\u201d I think she had planned it. To be honest, it\u2019s a good thing she left. Our four-person tent didn\u2019t fit in our tiny garden. So we put up my old festival tent, cosy for three; even that only just went in. I know, we\u2019re lucky \u2013 especially now \u2013 to have any garden. But I think you could do a version of this even without one. Put a tent up inside. If you haven\u2019t got a tent, make one out of sheets and the sofa cushions, maybe. Use your imagination \u2013 and then again to decide where you are. Alexa, play jungle noises. Why is home-holidaying such a great idea? It\u2019s cheap \u2013 really cheap; almost certainly the cheapest holiday you\u2019ll ever take. No fares, no accommodation, no campsite fees, just what you would have been consuming anyway, plus one bag of marshmallows. You can turn the heating off, too, and anyone still inside can put on an extra layer. There\u2019s no added eco-guilt \u2013 this is almost certainly the greenest holiday you\u2019ll ever take, too. No flying, no driving, no emissions at all, apart from the ones that children produce anyway \u2013 especially in small tents, it seems. There may be a fire \u2013 but ours was just two bits of wood. Sorry, I suppose it wasn\u2019t entirely necessary, but I think we\u2019ve got some credit in that department. It\u2019s something to do, and something different to do. That has been one of the big problems during lockdown \u2013 the sameness of every day, of the weekdays merging into weekends, of not being able to get out, the lack of any kind of excitement or adventure that doesn\u2019t come via a screen. Garden camping offers proper terror, without putting anyone in danger, although I guess that depends on where you live. It is actually \u2013 amazingly and in spite of everything \u2013 quite fun. Not just doing stuff you do on holiday, and being a bit scared, but simply sleeping in a big pile together. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s transferable inside. Obviously, there\u2019s an upper age limit; if ours were much older, it would almost certainly be the lamest, most ridiculous idea ever. But this time they enjoyed it, the big-pileness of it, being close as a family, talking, having a laugh. Fighting, too, of course, but fighting somewhere new. They want there to be a next time. We were supposed to be going to Wales for a week, in the Easter holidays. Then we weren\u2019t going to Wales, or anywhere, obviously. No one even knows when the weekends are, let alone remembers when the Easter holidays were meant to be. The normal punctuation of life has gone. But why let this thing spoil everything? We\u2019ve had a bash at home-schooling (although we would definitely go straight into special measures if Ofsted visited); why shouldn\u2019t we home-holiday, too? There was some cheating. We cooked our pasta inside, but brought it out to eat. We made a fire in the barbecue to burn marshmallows on afterwards. Different people do different things on holiday; we burn marshmallows. Do what you do on holiday, to make it feel (a bit) like one. We also play cards on holiday, so after brushing teeth at the outside tap, that\u2019s what we did: old maid and whist. Followed by books. No, we cannot Zoom Mummy \u2013 she\u2019s only been gone five minutes. God, is it really only 8.25pm? It was quite a long night. And a cold one. (The boys were all right \u2013 they shared the air mattress \u2013 but I was on the ground.) And a noisy one. Camping in north-west London, you hear things you might not normally associate with camping, or hear in Wales, say. Not just the prowling murderer/cat, but the Jubilee line, bringing key-worker heroes home. A domestic disagreement (it\u2019s a good way of getting to know the neighbours better). An electric guitar from up the road (\u201cOI, PIPE DOWN, JIMI HENDRIX!\u201d) Also sirens \u2013 lots of sirens \u2013 a sobering reminder of what this is all really about. While we\u2019re playing Scott of the Antarctic, people nearby are dying. At last, is that the first 226 bus of the day, early-shift heroes off to work? That means it\u2019s just before five, and not too much longer of this to go. There\u2019s even a dawn chorus of sorts \u2013 the cooing of a London pigeon and something shrill and persistent, an avian alarm call, perhaps. Watch out \u2013 Gatsby\u2019s about. By the time we unzip and emerge, blinking and shivering, the local goldfinch posse is burbling busily at the bird feeder. See, we\u2019re reconnecting with nature, too. And our house! In a whole new light, bricks and mortar, heating, beds, porridge. What just yesterday was beginning to feel a little like a prison now looks like the greatest thing in the world, as One Ton Depot might have looked to Scott, Captain Oates and companions, had they made it. There\u2019s nothing like taking something away to make you really appreciate it. Learn to love home again \u2013 or appreciate it, at least. No, we\u2019re not doing it tonight, too \u2013 that was a short holiday, like a little early-season minibreak. They \u2013 I \u2013 need a good night\u2019s sleep in a warm bed. We will go again, though, soon. Next Tuesday? Oh, apparently, it\u2019s already in the diary. But now there\u2019s tidying up to do \u2013 damp stuff to come in, mattress to be deflated, tent to be unpitched and wrestled into the bag \u2026 the boring stuff, normally, but less so now \u2013 just stuff to do. The dos and don\u2019ts of home camping Do Take an eye mask and earplugs, just as you would at a festival. It\u2019s surprisingly loud out there at night. And a head torch, for reading and games. Or for pretending you\u2019re Bear Grylls. Check your garden for animal scat. The stink of cat poo all night really doesn\u2019t help. Make sure your phone is charged, so that when the kids eventually drop off you can stop pretending and go back to the serious business of checking Twitter and worrying. Don\u2019t Forget your toothbrush. (Remember that show, in the 90s?) But do brush al fresco for authenticity. Be fooled by signs of spring. It\u2019s cold out there \u2013 take lots of bedding. Allow any musical instruments. It\u2019s not fair on you or the neighbours. Attempt this on a booze-free night, if you\u2019re rash enough to be doing them. Be bullied into another night immediately. Yeah, it was fun \u2013 but not that much fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
