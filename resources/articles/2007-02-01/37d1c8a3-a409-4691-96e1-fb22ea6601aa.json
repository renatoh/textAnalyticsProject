It's on the first floor and looks north, towards the King's Road about 150 yards away. It's surprisingly quiet. From the top floor you can see the spire of the church Dickens got married in. We have a massive book-storage problem, as this room exemplifies. On the left you can see about 10 percent of the books stacked on the floor: they are mini-libraries for projects I'm working on. Books stacked on the right are books I'm reading (or going to read) for pleasure. Every two years or so there has to be a major purge and the books go to other book-crammed rooms in the house. I am not tidy and I seem to thrive in this unseemly chaos. The rows of CDs (I listen to music all the time) are in no real order either but I can find pretty much any book or CD I want in about a couple of minutes. The film poster is from the American release of Stars and Bars in 1988, the first of my novels to be filmed. It has a secure place in my heart and will probably come to be seen as the most unusual film Daniel Day-Lewis ever starred in. The director, Pat O'Connor, is a great friend. The wall you can't see (behind the chair) is covered in more memorabilia - film posters, book jackets, photos. I spend a lot of time in this room but I tend to write between lunch and the cocktail hour (signalled by the arrival of Channel 4 news). The desk is a cherrywood table and my chair is an ancient Lloyd Loom made comfortable by three busted cushions. I don't know why I've never bought a proper chair. I write my first drafts in longhand and for that the computer gets pushed back and the keyboard moved aside. The room is a kind of time capsule representing all the books I've written in it (nine, so far) and the many films. There's a fire and a sofa (out of shot). It's a space I'm very comfortable in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
