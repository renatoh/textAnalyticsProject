I live in a lower ground floor flat, which is currently carpeted. I want to take this up (there is only concrete beneath) and put down wood flooring, but I don't want to raise the floor too much (there's not much ceiling room), and I don't want to spend a fortune. Where do I start? I've seen nice wood flooring in shops, but it's really expensive and I'm not sure how to fit it or who to get in. You can have what is effectively a floating floor. Tony Traynor, timber technician at Wood For Good, which campaigns for best practice in the timber industry, has the following advice: 'The height problem is solved by using thinner solid flooring products or engineered flooring [around 14-15mm thickness. You need to make sure the concrete surface is clean and dry with no lumps or bumps. A polythene sheet will need to be laid to form a vapour barrier. The boards are then laid on to the surface and glued together, leaving a small expansion gap [5-8mm] around the perimeter of the room. 'In terms of product, you have a choice of solid timber flooring, engineered wooden flooring or laminate flooring. It sounds as if real wood is what you're after, in which case you need to ask for either solid or engineered timber that has been specially kiln-dried to a moisture content of around 8%. If you don't want to treat it further once it's fitted, ask for a factory applied finish. If you want to decide the colour of the stain yourself, ask for the product in its natural state. 'In terms of cost, this flooring is no more expensive than carpet. For example, a standard-quality solid pine floor costs around \u00a320 per square metre from a trade-type outlet. Of course, some of the more \"exotic\" species such as oak, beech or walnut are more expensive - from \u00a340 per square metre upwards. 'Here are some suppliers I would recommend: Swedish company Ess-Enn, 01206 548808, ess-enn.se; Swiftwood Imports, 01945 587000, swiftwood.co.uk; Taylor Maxwell Timber, 0113-274 4655 for stockists. For a wider list, contact the Timber Trade Federation at ttf.co.uk. 'In terms of carrying out the work, any local qualified joiner or joinery company could do this.

Flatpack fury Why is flatpack furniture so unattractive? Aren't there better options? Actually, it's a whole lot better than it used to be. These days, young designers accept the constraints of transportation and cost, so they're designing expressly with flatpacking in mind. According to Melinda Ashton Turner, interiors stylist and former Ikea store designer (that's a lot of flat pack assembly): 'It's ugly because it has been put together with an Allen key and you can see the joins or it wobbles. But often, the issue is one of price. Not all flatpack furniture is veneer any more - you can get some lovely solid pieces and there are great companies making it.' Ashton Turner recommends the furniture arm of La Redoute, AM PM (0870 0500 455; redoute.co.uk), for lovely solid cabinets and French-style armoires at very reasonable prices; or Unto This Last (020-7613 0882; untothislast.co.uk) for more modern pieces. For a professional finish, it's worth calling in a company such as Flatpackers UK, (01784 477420; furnitureassembly.co.uk) to put it together for you. Deranged blackbird I have a blackbird in my garden that must be nesting nearby. For the past week it has been flapping around beep-beep-beeping at anything that moves. Apart from shooting it, what can be done? This is not a joke, by the way - it is driving me round the bend. Ian Peters of the RSPB says, 'Blackbirds are very territorial and it could be that this bird is nesting for the first time.' This is not unusual, so fear not - it is unlikely you have encountered the devil of all blackbirds. 'First-time breeders don't behave normally,' says Peters, 'but eventually this will settle down. Quite often males will just go on and on if there is a predator like a cat about and it's his way of warning the young ones to beware and keep their heads down.' Although it's annoying, it is unlikely to escalate into anything more than a bit of noise and fuss. Peters does have a suggestion for quietening down the bird, although it might give the neighbours something to gossip about. 'The safest way to combat this - it might sound a bit silly - is to wear a baseball hat the wrong way round with sunglasses on the back of your head.' Odd as that sounds, the bird will be confused by not knowing which way you're facing and so pipe down. Apparently, this is a tried-and-tested method normally used for bigger, more aggressive birds such as gulls. Peters adds, 'It should just ease off, though, because it is complete bluster.'

So we went right to the top for some first-hand advice. Kim Woodburn, of How Clean Is Your House, says, 'Without a doubt - my mother used it, my grandmother used it - you need a good old string mop. You can't beat it. You can't bleach a synthetic mop - it would perish. A cotton string mop will last a lifetime - you can bleach them, wash them and hang them on the line. You just can't put the same pressure behind a sponge mop. 'If it gets really dirty and grey, pop it in a bucket with a bit of washing-up liquid and a couple of caps of bleach and it will come out lovely and white. If there is one thing time hasn't bettered, it's the mop.'
