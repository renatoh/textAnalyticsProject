Root admitted that England should have come up with better answers to India\u2019s seamers after a ball change in mid-afternoon as six wickets tumbled for 68 runs in 21 overs on a pitch that had been the subject of so many complaints for its placidity on the first two days. \u201cIt was obviously a key part of the game,\u201d said Root, who ended the day unbeaten on 78 from 158 balls, a return to form in the No5 spot after scores of 13 and 31 against Sri Lanka on home turf at Headingley. \u201cThe ball change played a big part and we didn\u2019t respond to it well enough. It\u2019s not ideal obviously; as batters we\u2019d like to make sure we contribute more. We\u2019re going to have to recognise those periods and front up a bit sooner. We knew our backs were against the wall and we had to fight. The way we responded after tea was fantastic. The way Stuart came out and played made it easier for me. That was a phenomenal knock, to come out and play that bravely, and at the end Jimmy was sensational.\u201d Broad made 47 from 42 balls in an eighth-wicket stand of 78 and Root\u2019s partnership with Anderson has so far added 54, England\u2019s best return for the last wicket since Broad put on 61 with Darren Pattinson against South Africa at Headingley in 2008. Root confirmed that Matt Prior\u2019s unfortunate dismissal reinforced England\u2019s \u201cfrustration\u201d that the decision review system has been made unavailable for the series by India. \u201cUntil the ICC make it mandatory for everyone to use it, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d he said. Ishant Sharma, who started the rot in England\u2019s middle order with a post-lunch spell of three for 29 in seven overs, suggested that India are unlikely to make a bold declaration if it carries any risk of defeat. \u201cOn these kind of wickets you can\u2019t predict, as we have seen with the last-wicket stands,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a captaincy decision, not mine.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
