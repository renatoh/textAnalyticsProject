The culmination of the love story in Fleabag series two was not met with the familiar heavy metal riff. Instead, there was haunting choral chanting, which graduated from young boys\u2019 voices to adults during the series. It climaxed as the protagonist made her fantasy of shagging the Hot Priest a reality. \u201cOne person on Twitter realised and said: \u2018Guys, has anyone heard what they\u2019re singing in Latin in Fleabag?\u2019\u201d laughs Isobel Waller-Bridge, sister of Phoebe and the composer for the multi-award winning BBC series. It turns out that Waller-Bridge had stuck in some choice words for male and female body parts in the religious performance \u2013 she still won\u2019t reveal exactly what \u2013 and played around with some double entendres. \u201cThe phrase: \u2018We\u2019re coming\u2019 worked because she [Fleabag] does go on this almighty journey, a coming-of-age story,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s redemption; there\u2019s light, we\u2019re coming.\u201d It also presumably gave a niche group of Latin scholars in the audience a little smirk. Whether it is translating obscure words from a seconds-long piece of music or humming the theme tune to Succession (an infuriatingly perfect earworm), in this golden age of TV, we are all tuned in more than ever to scores of popular series. The surprise success of last year\u2019s HBO/Sky hit, Chernobyl, was underpinned by its eerie and highly disconcerting soundtrack, created by the Icelandic composer, Hildur Gudnad\u00f3ttir, who won an Emmy and a Grammy for her pitch-perfect work. David Holmes and Unloved\u2019s neo-retro, dark female-fronted tracks for Killing Eve, have become as iconic as the image of Villanelle in her pink dress and biker boots. At the time of last year\u2019s general election, social media was awash with reworkings of the flash-forward device employed by Russell T Davies\u2019s dystopian family thriller, Years and Years. But it only worked because users could rip off the same music and edit their own end-of-days visions of what life would be like under the leader they didn\u2019t want to the same soundtrack. Similar to Fleabag, the theme of Years and Years was also heavily weighted with religious symbolism. This urgent, anxiety-inducing music was composed by Murray Gold and performed by a Bulgarian choir. Although he never officially released it, or even titled it, fans uploaded it to YouTube, and gave it their own name: In to the Future. \u201cI just wanted it to sound like a panic,\u201d Gold says. \u201cIt was actually just vowels the choir were singing. I think if I had used words, if you could have interpreted it, it would have detracted from it. I like that it ended up sounding like a war chant.\u201d Given the prescient nature of the series, I can\u2019t be the only person who has this theme running through their head as I tune into breaking news; a simulated reality brought to life by ticking clocks and furious arpeggios of Gold\u2019s making. \u201cMusic is insidious,\u201d says Gold, \u201ca magical ingredient you can\u2019t resist, you don\u2019t have a choice. I\u2019m ultimately looking to get people to fall in love with the characters.\u201d Gold \u2013 who also scored the music for Doctor Who for more than a decade (and teases that he has previously \u201cembedded hidden messages\u201d in music for some of The Master scenes), as well as Gentleman Jack and A Very English Scandal \u2013 says that the music for the BBC One show came to him quickly upon reading the script. \u201cIt was a very immediate thing, so much of that music was written in seconds. Sometimes the creative process needs to be done in one breath, to just get it down. I don\u2019t think the music is actually that dark. There is hope there. I don\u2019t think I could ever write a piece of music that didn\u2019t have hope in it.\u201d Gold has the privilege of mainly working with long-time collaborators \u2013 Davies, Sally Wainwright and most recently Stephen Frears \u2013 and Waller-Bridge also had the advantage of already being on close, personal terms to the creator of Fleabag. She was on board for sound direction from the show\u2019s inception as a theatre performance at the Edinburgh festival in 2013, and has helped shape the character of Fleabag through to her transition to TV in 2016 through the use of music. It was a conscious decision not to have a theme tune for the show, Waller-Bridge says, instead using a short burst of music over the title. The sibling connection definitely helped her translate Phoebe\u2019s vaguest of briefs: \u201cShe said: \u2018I want it to sound a bit like this \u2026\u2019 and she pulled this facial expression. So I ended up creating the two-and-a-half second jazzy \u2018scrunk\u2019 we used. \u201cBecause the rhythm of the writing was so tight in series one, we collectively felt that we didn\u2019t need that much music. A few times I got a few percussive instruments in there, like a triangle that indicates something\u2019s up, or bits of jazz for Harry. When she sees her sister Claire, it represents what the temperature and energy of that relationship is. With the second series, there were various factors \u2013 church themes, the priest \u2013 we thought would be interesting to reference. For me, the music in the show reflected the character, it\u2019s really connected to Fleabag. At one point, we discussed if Fleabag could hear the score and was controlling it.\u201d Waller-Bridge also worked as composer for Black Mirror\u2019s Miley Cyrus-starring episode, Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too, and the BBC\u2019s The ABC Murders. \u201cThe job of music for TV is to set up the tone and to support the narrative arc. I worked with a director on The ABC Murders and he said: \u2018At this moment, we want them to cry\u2019 which was a really interesting thing; you already know the intention of what he wants from the audience, he wants them to be moved at this point. The character will take you there, but you need to help support it. \u201cI\u2019m asked all different things for the music, like: \u2018Can you give them more chemistry? Can you give the lovers more sexual tension?\u2019 Music can be really effective like that. But when you have music that\u2019s threaded really beautifully into a scene, you can really experience the feeling of loneliness, or love.\u201d Matthew Herbert, composer for the BBC adaptation of Malorie Blackman\u2019s Noughts + Crosses and Sky\u2019s Temple takes a differing view on the role of a TV composer: \u201cThere\u2019s a real trap for music in film and television where it works just emotionally, telling you what to think at any one time or it\u2019s just decoration to help smooth the passage of the drama and actually, I think it\u2019s much more than that. \u201cIn many ways you have to kind of embody the spirit of the story. So many times on TV, you really notice when the music comes in and you feel manipulated and it feels tacky. There\u2019s things like piano everywhere these days and cheap string sounds and it can feel quite complacent and quite lazy, like people haven\u2019t taken it seriously enough.\u201d For Noughts + Crosses, the music was an integral part of world-building for the viewer, as the novels are set in an alternative reality where Africa is the dominant world leader, and black people are the ruling elite. The soundtrack was two years in the making (\u201cDefinitely challenging at times\u201d, he admits) as he worked to create a fitting sound for the show: \u201cIt\u2019s really hard with music because it doesn\u2019t just exist in isolation and doesn\u2019t just come from nowhere. It\u2019s surrounded by stories and context and where it comes from. \u201cWith every project, I try to create a unique language that lets you get out of some of the dead ends and the stylistic ends that you can find yourself in if you\u2019re not careful.\u201d For Noughts + Crosses, this included using found sound recorded in buildings in Bristol that were part of the slave trade, and he sampled African instruments and distorted them in a similar way to Congolese band Konono No 1. The fact the public are connecting with TV soundtracks in a way unlike before is evident in the streaming figures and downloads of music from recent small screen hits, but there is a commercial aspect to this, according to Dr Dominic McHugh, a musicologist at the University of Sheffield. \u201cPeople are connecting more with TV soundtracks these days as they\u2019ve become a branding exercise,\u201d says McHugh. \u201cThe iTunes and Spotify generation know they can download and stream the soundtrack straight away, something that wasn\u2019t possible a few years years ago. And it\u2019s the music that often draws us in to bingewatch the next episode of a show on streaming sites like Netflix.\u201d We are also relating to the music psychologically, he adds: \u201cThe score often acts as an extra sense, an additional oral sensation; it assaults our ears and brains. The music elevates the emotional impact of the show, or because it can add a third dimension to the show. It can sometimes become a character in its own right; it can tell us things that other characters can\u2019t.\u201d While music has become intrinsic in helping shape how we watch television today, Herbert says that complaints about it from some viewers don\u2019t bother him: \u201cThe BBC is developing a system of delivery for programmes which allows you to turn the music down or even off. That makes me absolutely thrilled. I think that\u2019s actually really exciting.\u201d Gold is equally equanimous about criticism. \u201cOne of my most cherished memories is someone complaining about Doctor Who: \u2018I wish I could turn the music off.\u2019 That they don\u2019t like it shows they\u2019ve connected with it on some emotional level. People don\u2019t always know what it\u2019s doing to them, it\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m feeling this and I don\u2019t know why\u2019 and you hope it\u2019s something to do with your art form, with your knowledge and technique of what you\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 April to make clear that Matthew Herbert did not say that he sampled Konono No 1, but was inspired by them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
