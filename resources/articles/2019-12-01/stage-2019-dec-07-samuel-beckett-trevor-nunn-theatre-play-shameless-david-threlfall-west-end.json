But for the renowned British stage director the production will also be a reunion with a well-known actor he first helped establish as a leading talent almost as long ago. David Threlfall, most famous for his long-running television role in Shameless, has been cast by Nunn to play alongside Niall Buggy in the two-hander. Thirty-nine years ago, Nunn and Threlfall received extraordinary accolades together when the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s sellout production of Charles Dickens\u2019s The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, which Nunn co-directed with John Caird, won top awards in London and on Broadway. The epic two-part show is still regularly cited as one of the great theatrical achievements of the modern era. \u201cBeing reunited with David is wonderful,\u201d said Nunn, who regards the actor as especially fearless. \u201cPeople know he can be daring. He very much responds to taking risks and exploring the possibilities. It is really gratifying to be working together again now in this Beckett play which is pretty much completely unknown, and is very Godot-like.\u201d Beckett wrote The Old Tune in 1960, basing it on a radio play by the French writer Robert Pinget. \u201cBeckett was friends with Pinget and thought it was wonderful, and asked if he could do it,\u201d said Nunn, who is presenting it at the Jermyn Street theatre in a triple bill with Beckett\u2019s better known Krapp\u2019s Last Tape and Eh Joe. \u201cBut I think he changed it quite a lot and also put it into colloquial Irish. \u201cIt is about two elderly men, though not tramps, who meet again on a bench after a long time. One of them, played by Niall, has certainly fallen on hard times and the other has done slightly better.\u201d In 1980, Nunn and Caird\u2019s staging of Nickleby featured a cast of 40 actors, including Alun Armstrong and the late Bob Peck, but at its centre, playing Nicholas and his unfortunate and undernourished companion, Smike, were Roger Rees and Threlfall, who was 27 at the time. \u201cDavid was a small-part player when we cast him and there were many of those. Then he and Roger both became the talk of the town in New York,\u201d said Nunn. \u201cAnd it was notoriously the first $100 ticket, because it was two performances at $50.\u201d Threlfall remained good friends with Nunn but has only worked once with him since then, on a 2003 stage adaptation of David Almond\u2019s popular children\u2019s book Skellig. Threlfall said that he owes Nunn a lot personally, not just as an actor: \u201cHe lets me be a court jester to his controlling king and we get on under that basis. Trevor gives you a lot of rope, but he is a complete control freak at the same time. How do you put that nicely? He is also one of the most generous human beings you could meet.\u201d Leading TV roles for Threlfall opposite Victoria Wood in her second world war drama Housewife, 49, and as Tommy Cooper in the 2003 ITV film Not Like That, Like This have established his range and built his reputation for physically altering himself in a part. As Smike he spent his time on stage curled into a ball of pain and nerves. \u201cIt was rather like when an actor plays Richard III and they are twisting their body,\u201d said Nunn. \u201cThey will begin to get all sorts of aches and David completely changed his body shape for that role. I was very aware of that and I kept urging him to rest before each show, but I think he was very excited. He loves to transform.\u201d However, Threlfall said he does not make a distinction between playing big, extreme characters and quieter ones. He looks for a way to heighten both. \u201cIt is just what I do. I can\u2019t write books about it, I can just do it. There is a Vaudevillian in me. I don\u2019t really do the documentary style of acting.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
