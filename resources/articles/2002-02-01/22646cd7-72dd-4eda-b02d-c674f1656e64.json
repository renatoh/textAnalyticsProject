Yet, as he embarks on his second world championship season as one of the brightest young drivers to emerge in decades, there is already one McLaren record in the history books that he can never beat. Raikkonen will be 22 years and four months old when he lines up on the Melbourne grid this Sunday, just over five weeks older than Bruce McLaren when he became the youngest grand prix victor with his win in the 1959 US grand prix at Florida's Sebring aerodrome circuit at the wheel of a Cooper. McLaren, who was killed in 1970 in a testing accident at Goodwood, had a keen eye for young racing talent. He would have approved of Raikkonen's youthful flair, even though only 12 months have passed since Max Mosley, president of the governing body, the FIA, branded its formula one commission as \"irresponsible and potentially dangerous\" when it voted to allow him a super licence. Many people regarded Mosley's caution as understandable, bearing in mind that he was considering the potential of a man who had competed in only 23 car races in his life. Happily Mosley's misgivings proved groundless. Driving a Sauber-Ferrari, Raikkonen scored a championship point in his first race, a momentous achievement. All now agree that he is blessed with a rare talent that could well carry him to international stardom and celebrity status in this most colourful and fast moving of global sports. Born in Espoo, Finland, on October 17, 1979, he is an introspective man with seemingly modest tastes. Away from the roar of the formula one pit lane he likes snowboarding, ice hockey and jogging. His favourite food is pasta, washed down with pineapple juice or just water. \"Initially Kimi was so quiet in testing with us that the engineers were beginning to worry about coaxing the necessary information out of him,\" said Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren managing director. \"But he has now loosened up a lot and the sight of him coming round the last corner before the pits at Barcelona in a controlled, opposite lock slide, lap after lap, has not only been very exciting for the team but also demonstrated that he's a very skilled and determined driver. \"Sure, he is more talkative in the car than out of it, which is what we're paying him for. He seems smart, talented and hasn't yet done anything silly with the machinery.\" Raikkonen began kart racing in 1991 when he was 11 and shot to prominence in 2000 when he won the British Formula Renault 2000 Championship. It was clearly the springboard to stardom he needed. When the McLaren-Mercedes team sat down last season and worked through the process of selecting a logical successor to Mika Hakkinen for the 2002 season, Raikkonen's on-track performances confirmed his status as the ideal man for the job. \"I will be doing my best to show the team they have made the right decision in hiring me,\" the Finn said. In assessing Raikkonen's talent, it is necessary to strip away the underlying current of cynicism which runs through the formula one business like a deeply ingrained thread. Detractors suggest that the current generation of formula one cars are too easy to drive; electronic driver aids abound; there is traction control and automatic gearboxes. All the driver has to do, they say, is sit behind the wheel and press the pedals -a genuine case of PlayStation for grown-ups. Yet this is an oversimplification. It is the same for everybody and the very best drivers in the world - Hakkinen, David Coulthard and Michael Schumacher - are all being measured against each other in the same set of circumstances at the same moment. From the start of his formula one career, Raikkonen has displayed an unruffled confidence and calm which belied his lack of experience. \"Last season everybody at Sauber was amazed at how relaxed he appeared, sleeping soundly in the motorhome in the hour's run-up to the start of the races,\" said a member of the Swiss team. \"He never showed any hint of nerves when strapped into the car on the grid.\" This season he faces the challenge of racing alongside his new team-mate David Coulthard with equanimity. Confident, but not pushy, the young Finn remains philosophical about his promotion to the sport's premier league. \"It's only my second year in formula one and already I'm going to have a chance to get on the podium, and even win races,\" he predicts with a measured sense of optimism. Throughout the 2001 season Hakkinen increasingly acted as an informal mentor and sounding board for his younger compatriot. The 1998 and '99 world champion summed up the promise of his young compatriot: \"In Kimi I sometimes find myself almost recognising myself as I was at the start of my own formula one career.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
