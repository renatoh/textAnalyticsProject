The wonderful outfielding of Arran Brindle in running out Lisa Keightley and Karen Rolton had offered England a glimmer of hope against a team they have not beaten since the 1993 World Cup, but Australia's captain Belinda Clark batted through to the 37th over for her 62. England's total of 158 all out after being sent in to bat was far less than they would have wanted but still more than they had looked likely to make after Cathryn Fitzpatrick, her blonde mane reminiscent of Jeff Thomson, ripped through the top order. The captain Clare Connor (35) and Brindle (32) offered some resistance in the middle order and the veteran Clare Taylor (29) rallied the tail after England had slumped to 106 for eight. In reply Australia, led by the peerless Clark, pounced on anything slightly off line. England's bowlers were failing a searching examination when Brindle snatched two wickets with superb direct hits from backward point. But Clark and Lisa Sthalekar (29) refused to allow England to spring a surprise. There were plenty of tears for Connor's team as they trooped off the field in Potchefstroom's late-afternoon sun, but by the evening they were proud of a stout effort. \"It was a gutsy performance, particularly since we were missing our injured spearhead Lucy Pearson, but we were always short of runs,\" Connor reflected afterwards. \"We showed a lot of courage and a lot of fight in the field. We didn't bowl well at all times during the game and I think we know where we've got to go and improve. \"We've had some ups and downs but it was good to get to the semi-finals and we're obviously just disappointed not to go that one step further.\" Australia will now play India or New Zealand in the final. The second semi-final will be at the same venue tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
