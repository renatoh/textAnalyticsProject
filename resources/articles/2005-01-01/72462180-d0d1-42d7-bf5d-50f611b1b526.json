Ruud Gullit has offered the 30-year-old a two-year contract at the Rotterdam club and Rangers have improved on their initial offer for the player with the proposal of an 18-month deal. The Scots have earmarked the central defender as a replacement for Jean-Alain Boumsong after his move to Newcastle. Henchoz is available for a nominal fee as his contract at Anfield ends in the summer. The defender's agent Jorg Vonmatt, who has already spoken with Rangers, will now talk to Feyenoord, although his client favours remaining in the north-west, where he was previously based with Blackburn, and could hold out for a move to Bolton. Wanderers were struggling to meet the player's wage demands but have since put seven players on the transfer-list - Henrik Pedersen, Fernando Hierro, Anthony Barness, Blessing Kaku, Florent Laville, Julio Cesar and Kevin Poole - in an attempt to raise funds. In the meantime Henchoz remains in Switzerland where his wife recently gave birth to a boy. Bolton's manager Sam Allardyce would also like to put any money he generates towards buying Portsmouth's Amdy Faye. The midfielder would cost about \u00a32m and Allardyce said: \"He's a player I'm very interested in.\" Liverpool will offer their Germany international midfielder Dietmar Hamann a one-year contract extension in an attempt to keep him at Anfield. The 31-year-old's current deal expires in the summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
