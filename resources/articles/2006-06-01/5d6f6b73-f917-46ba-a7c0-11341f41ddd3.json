The Indian Ocean tsunami that devastated 11 countries led to sympathy and support from around the globe when people on Christmas holidays were hit by the after-shock of the tragedy unfolding before them on 24-hour media channels. The same media that brought the tsunami into our living rooms soon highlighted systematic failings. The National Audit Office's report told of the \"wrong kind of aid\" clogging airfields and aid workers sent to the wrong regions - mistakes that were replicated in 2005's other humanitarian disasters, particularly Hurricane Katrina where chaos filled the vacuum left by effective logistics on the ground. So what exactly is logistics? Logistics can be defined as the \"five rights\" ensuring that goods or services are in the right place, at the right time, in the right quantity, at the right quality and at the right price. The supply chain that ensures that you have milk for your breakfast and petrol for your car becomes the demand chain in humanitarian scenarios ensuring that the right aid gets to the right people at the right time to save the lives and reduce suffering despite often hostile climatic and political terrains and temperatures. Untargeted knee-jerk responses to a disaster demonstrate that one cannot simply throw millions of pounds of government emergency aid and voluntary donations at the problem without the right expertise, local knowledge and infrastructure to deliver the five rights on the ground. In reality you cannot simply parachute effective logistics into the world's vulnerable areas. You have to be able to organically grow the expertise around the world. However, disasters striking in the richer western world, such as New Orleans in 2005, show that those natural or man-made trouble spots have become less easy to identify. What will most benefit these areas is increased knowledge, and this is the reason why the Princess Royal has launched a new qualification that recognises the \"unsung hero\" role of humanitarian logisticians who help save lives and reduce suffering at times of crisis. The princess, who is the patron of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in the UK (CILTUK), and president of Save The Children and Transaid, said: \"I cannot stress too highly the vital importance of efficient transport and logistics systems to support development in the world's poorest countries.\" An HGV licence holder herself, the princess understands the \"roll-your-sleeves-up\" logistics needed to respond appropriately to humanitarian situations. She spoke of her experiences of visiting countries such as Sudan and stressed the importance of local expertise and resources. \"Experience of the country, customs and culture is vital in responding to humanitarian situations, so bringing in experts from outside is not an option. What is required is a local pool of expertise,\" she said. The new qualification, which will be available this September, has been developed by CILTUK and Fritz Institute, a non-profit organisation based in San Francisco. It has been designed for individuals who are working in operational management positions within the field of humanitarian logistics. It will also be a suitable level of qualification for those interested in relevant supply-chain experience from the commercial sector. The qualification starts by defining the skills, resources and aid coming from a variety of agencies. Topics such as the procurement and sourcing of goods, transportation and fleet management in a humanitarian context are also covered. All of these areas are vital to ensure that aid organisations can respond quickly to emergency situations. This is the first in a series of qualifications being developed in this area. At the Institute we have offered logistics and supply-chain qualifications for many years, but the needs of this particular group, along with the scale of disasters and the support needed in getting effective aid requires a specialist approach, which we have now developed. Following the tsunami, it became clear that many of our members wanted to harness the skills and knowledge of their profession to benefit the humanitarian sector, and they contacted the institute with offers of help. As logistics and supply-chain professionals they can share good commercial practice with the humanitarian sector, but what is also needed is to train and offer professional development to those people working in the area of logistics in countries around the world. In conclusion, the princess said: \"Logistics is often below people's radar and one of the key challenges now was to obtain international recognition for the qualification from the governments and the UN so that it acts as a benchmark of logistics excellence for those working in humanitarian logistics. \u00b7 Dorothea Carvalho is the director of professional development at the Chartered Institute of logistics and Transport in the UK"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
