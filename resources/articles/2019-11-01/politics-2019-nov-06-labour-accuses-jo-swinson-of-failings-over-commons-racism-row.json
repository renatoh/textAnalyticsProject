Swinson said it was right that Steve Wilson, the husband of parliamentary candidate Angela Smith, had apologised to the shadow equalities minister, Dawn Butler, for writing on social media that she had lied about her experience of racism in the House of Commons. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Swinson said she believed Butler encountered racial discrimination and that Wilson\u2019s apology had been \u201cessential\u201d. However, she was criticised for not suspending him or revealing whether he faced any kind of disciplinary process. Butler is also demanding Wilson and Smith undergo diversity training. The shadow equalities minister, who is one of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s most senior allies, said: \u201cIt has taken almost three weeks to get a one-line apology from Steven Wilson, which demonstrates no understanding of why what he said was unacceptable. Jo Swinson is refusing to say what disciplinary action will be taken against him and refusing to confirm whether he and Angela Smith will be required to attend equalities training. \u201cBy protecting a white man who denied a black woman\u2019s experience, the Lib Dems are actively condoning racism in their party and promoting it in wider society. Steve Wilson should be suspended from their party immediately.\u201d The Labour MP wrote about her experience of being a black woman in politics when she first entered parliament in an opinion piece for the Metro in October as part of Black History Month. She wrote: \u201cI still remember the shock when I got in a lift and was told that \u2018this lift isn\u2019t for cleaners\u2019. It stunned me. Such blatant racism from elected members of parliament stopped me in my tracks.\u201d In a reply to a post Butler made on Twitter sharing the article, Wilson wrote: \u201cSorry but this is just not true. I\u2019ve worked in parliament for 15 years and the lifts have always been for the use of everyone. Only time MPs have priority is during a division. Stories like this don\u2019t do anyone any justice and anyone propagating then [sic] should stop it.\u201d Wilson apologised publicly after being contacted by the Guardian and has also emailed Butler, saying: \u201cFurther to recent events considering comments made on Twitter, I would like to apologise wholeheartedly for the comments I made and the subsequent offence I caused.\u201d His wife defected to the Lib Dems in September after quitting Labour to formChange UK. Smith represented Penistone and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire before the election, but is now standing in Altrincham and Sale West in Greater Manchester. Swinson personally wrote to Butler to say she believed her account of racism and that everyone has a responsibility to be \u201ccareful with the words they use\u201d. She wrote: \u201cI believe we all have a responsibility to be careful with the words we use and to make sure that we are communicating in a way that is sensitive and appropriate. I understand that Mr Wilson has issued an apology for his tweet, which I believe to be essential in the circumstances. \u201cI want to be clear that I absolutely believe that your experience in the lift is genuine, and I think it is vital that when these experiences are shared that they are believed and not dismissed.\u201d She said all MPs and staff were expected to take the \u201cValuing Everyone\u201d training course run in the Commons. Butler wrote back: \u201cThis is a completely inadequate response to a complaint of racism, which is not in keeping with the Macpherson principles that instances of racism will be recorded and treated as such and investigated accordingly.\u201d On Tuesday, the Lib Dems contacted Butler to send her a link to a complaints form, which she had already filled out when she first complained to the party. However, they have not answered questions on whether Wilson faces any disciplinary action or if he has attended a training course on diversity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
