For the past hour. 16:27pm: Ponder the fact that it's little wonder the Fiver couldn't cleverly intertwine them when it three minutes just to detail the minutiae of Fiver's incompetence. 16:28pm: Grimace in irritation as Fiver hears the familiar rat-a-tat-tat of his alcoholic, bog-trotting, potato-gnawing Irish cousin Theme Pub O'Fiver's knobbly stick on the front door. Ignore him, as he doesn't actually exist and is simply a literary device who's dropped by to announce that Roy Keane has hinted at a return to international football. 16:30pm: So he has. 16:31pm: To be sure. 16:32pm: Add relevant quote from Keane: \"I have always said that I have missed international football - but then felt it was important to move on. But part of me has always said I have unfinished business and it will always be that way. I don't think it would be as simple as me saying that I would come back to international football. It would be down to Brian Kerr - it's as simple as that.\" 16:34pm: With added bits about him giving out about Manchester United's lazy youngsters: \"A lot of players seem to think you can slack off in training and turn up at Old Trafford on Saturday as if you are switching on a light. Well, you can't.\" 16:40pm: Aware that The Man is frowning, tut-tutting disapprovingly, tapping his Rolex and about to viciously tweak the string leading from his office to the Fiver's front-tail, resort to the last refuge of scoundrels ... 16:41pm: ... by inviting the readers to make up a story about Paul Scholes facing an FA rap and Sir Alex Ferguson starting his annual mind games with Arsene Wenger out of the following constituent parts. Ineffectual ginger England midfielder. Middlesbrough's Brazilian midfielder Doriva Girlie slap Video evidence Possible ban Purple-faced knight of the realm Patronising comments about rivals \"Arsenal have the added incentive of going undefeated and they will all be fully charged up trying to make sure they don't lose a game. But I know from past experience that is a big burden to carry.\" What? \"I was with Rangers in 1967 when we were unbeaten right to the last game of the season.\" Eh? \"And eventually lost.\" Oh. 16:59pm: The Man hands Fiver a bin liner. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"If you ask anybody in the Tartan Army or any Scottish supporter they would say that they would love to be at Euro 2004 and at the World Cup in 2006. If that means using a player that wasn't born in the country and lived in the country then it wouldn't matter. It's been happening in rugby for years so why shouldn't that happen in football?\" - Terry Butcher, the Englishman, points Berti Vogts in the direction of, erm, Lorenzo Amoruso. * * * * * * * * * * * * IN HOD WE TRUST Having recently cultivated an absurd thatch beard, slipped into a pair of open-toe sandals and buttoned up a comfortable cardigan, the Fiver has clearly found God. And not before time, some would say. As a result, and for just \u00a360 a month via www.godbothering.co.uk, we've been assured that a lifetime of gin-fuelled sins have been shoved out of sight under the Big Man's carpet. In return, we've had to agree to forgive those that trespass against us, rather than set the dogs on them, because where the Big Man's concerned, forgiveness is a very good thing. James Beattie almost certainly agrees, writes the Fiver, setting a new low for the most contrived introductory paragraph yet. \"I never had a problem with Glenn Hoddle,\" said the Southampton striker, who we must assume buys into all that reincarnation karma clap-trap. \"I certainly have no axe to grind with him and I would not slap in a transfer request if he returned to Southampton, as several fat hacks in the press have suggested over recent weeks.\" Clearly we've paraphrased, but you get the picture. \"At the moment,\" added Beattie, \"[Glenn's return to Southampton is] a question of 'ifs' because nobody knows who the chairman in going to appoint.\" That's not strictly true, of course, but it's an admirable stance given how Hoddle sinned against Beattie the last time he managed the Saints. \"Yes, he tried to sell me to Crystal Palace,\" shrugged the peroxide poacher, shaking his trendy mane in dismay. \"But I can see why he might have wanted to have done it. I was a raw, young striker who had not established myself in the first team and he had agreed what he thought was a good price for me.\" So where now for Beattie and Hod? \"I've always had the highest regard for his coaching ability. If he were to return, I would have no problems and would certainly be able to work with him.\" Gah! Bunkum Beattie!! Flick him the Vs. Ah, no, sorry. Hallelujah!! Praise be, etc. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Tottenham are apparently preparing a \u00a35m bid for Birmingham's former Gooner Matthew Upson, the first time they've spent money in defence since 1984. Real Betis winger Joaquin Sanchez's old man has hinted his son may sign for Real Madrid, despite Man United's attention. Whether Real themselves know about it or not is neither here nor there. And Chelsea are now adopting a policy of registering new players at birth to ensure no-one else can get their hands on them. They've apparently signed a deal which gives them first dibs on American prodigy Freddie Adu when he turns 18 in 2007. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF The mindless moron that is Jermaine Pennant has been banned from driving for 16 months and fined \u00a31,200 after he admitted drink-driving. Arsene Wenger wants the international fixture schedule overhauled after Ashley Cole and Gilberto Silva returned injured from friendlies. \"We have to maybe rearrange the whole fixture system because at the moment it does not work. There is so much at stake for clubs now and it is very difficult for them to lose players at this time,\" he said, his eye sight now fully restored. And Blackburn boss Graeme Souness has urged Berti Vogts to register Lorenzo Amoruso as a Scotland player. Desperate times and all that. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO Sky Sports 1: Premier League Review (7pm) Another day, another disastrous date. And despite yesterday's promise about this being the last one, we reckon there's still a few twitches left in this corpse ... if we kick it hard enough. So without further ado, please welcome Mr Rob Potts of Essex. \"A few years ago, my best friend persuaded me to go along on a blind date with two girls in Romford,\" he writes from the alloyed bureau in the back seat of his Capri. Sky Sports Xtra: QPR v Peterborough (7:30pm) \"Amazingly, my blind date was a bit of a sort and I decided there and then that I must have her or die in the attempt.\" No Mills &amp; Boon melodrama here, then. Bravo: Fashanu's Football Challenge (10pm) \"We went to Hollywood's nightclub, where I proceeded to bend the ear of the poor girl with every chat up line known to man without getting so much as a single response.\" You can see this one coming, can't you? Eh? Eh? Oh. Radio 5 Live: Sport On 5 (7pm) \"Convinced that I was the world's least funny man,\" Rob continues, despite having convinced us of same two paragraphs ago. \"I decided to cut my losses and told the ice maiden that I was leaving to get the night bus. Whereupon she fumbled in her handbag, plugged in the two biggest hearing aids I have ever seen and shouted 'What?'. Needless to say we are not married with three blah-de-blah etc.\" Talksport: Football First (7pm) She was deaf, see! Newstalk 106 (www.newstalk106.ie): Off The Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) Although we're wondering why she didn't just plug in her hearing aids earlier. Anyway, have you stepped out with Stevie Wonder and not realised he's blind? If so let us know.
