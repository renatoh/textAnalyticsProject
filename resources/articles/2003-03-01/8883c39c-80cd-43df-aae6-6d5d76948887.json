The course is not yet completed but these are dead men running. After delivering the latest \"full marks for effort\" report the West Brom manager Gary Megson conceded his side had just lost, with the most cruel timing possible, a game they simply had to win. \"We have to lift them for each game,\" he said. After this he was lifting them literally as well as psychologically. Albion sank to the turf almost to a man at the final whistle, 15 seconds after Horsfield's downward header broke spirit and body. This was a picture of desolation that must have touched even some Birmingham hearts amid the jubilation of derby triumph. After the emotion came the analysis. \"We always said we needed 38 points and now we're one win away,\" said Steve Bruce. By that yardstick Albion are a million miles away; they would need 17 points from a maximum 21. It cannot be done and Megson knows it. Megson, once again, confronted his team's carelessness: \"This was self-inflicted in terms of fortune.\" How, he was asking himself, had Stern John been able to stumble, recover the ball, turn and cross before the ball ricocheted to Horsfield at the far post? That was the biggest mistake of a match so error-strewn it could not be put down just to tension and a bobbly pitch. Perhaps the biological clocks had not been adjusted properly to a noon kick-off. Some passages of passing had, as Megson often says, \"to be seen to be believed\". Amid this purposelessness on strode Horsfield, substitute on a mission. Jason Roberts had just headed against Birmingham's bar but soon Albion were going backwards. Horsfield was the focal point of the final spell of pressure. \"When you're tiring, the last thing you need is Big Horse rampaging at you,\" said Bruce. Christophe Dugarry, all French finery but no finish, had been denied by Russell Hoult's leg and then by Neil Clement's off-the-line hack before Darren Carter missed the kind of aerial chance that Big Horse devours. Horsfield himself then connected in the air only for Hoult to tip over. But with his last leap Albion were downed. Bruce has another name for his powerful substitute. \"The gaffer calls me David Fairclough,\" said Horsfield. \"I've told him to shut up because I don't want that supersub tag. \"I am disappointed that I am not playing and I'll probably have a word with the gaffer on Monday and see what is going to happen. But if I didn't go knocking on his door I think he'd be disappointed. We'll put our points of view and we'll meet in the middle but it is his decision in the end. That's why he is manager.\" Horsfield does not have the magic touch of Fairclough, the former Liverpool striker, but four goals in 16 Premiership appearances as a substitute tells only half the story, according to his manager. \"I don't know how many times he's come on and turned games,\" said Bruce. \"Horsfield is a manager's dream. He's from Barnsley and I associate with him. He's had to fight all the way through his career.\" This season Horsfield has fought through groin injuries, a hernia operation and two red cards. But he is the man for a derby: two goals in the wins over Aston Villa and now one, crushingly, against Albion.
