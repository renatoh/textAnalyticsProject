Candice Servatius, whose two children attend an elementary school in Port Alberni, a small city on Vancouver Island, is seeking to have the supreme court of British Columbia ban indigenous ceremonies \u2013 and all other expressions of religion \u2013 from the public school district. Court documents point to a letter to parents, sent home at the start of the 2015 school year, that explained that a member of Vancouver Island\u2019s Nuu-chah-nulth indigenous community would visit the school and lead students in a traditional smudging ceremony. During the ceremony students would hold a cedar branch while smoke from burning sage would be fanned over them, the letter explained. \u201cThis will be our opportunity to learn about Nuu-chah-nulth traditions and experience cleansing of energy from previous students in our classroom \u2026 and cleanse our own spirits to allow great new experiences to occur for all us.\u201d Details on when the ceremony would be held were not included in the letter, but a contact was offered for any parents with questions. Servatius said in court documents that she visited the school the following day to discuss her concerns. She was left in \u201cshock\u201d, according to court documents, after finding out that the ceremony had already taken place in both of her children\u2019s classrooms. The letter to parents suggested the ceremony was a spiritual practice, Servatius argued in court filings, which would allegedly violate legislation requiring schools to be religiously neutral. \u201cThe children in the participating classrooms were not simply taught about this spiritual practice, they were directly involved in it.\u201d Servatius said her nine-year-old daughter informed the teacher she did not want to participate but was allegedly told it would be disrespectful to opt out of the ceremony. \u201cShe was led to believe, by adults who are in a position of trust, that her own religious beliefs were unworthy of respect,\u201d court documents said, leaving the child suffering \u201canxiety, shame and confusion\u201d. Shortly after the incident, Servatius detailed her concerns to the school in a letter. \u201cWe would like to be clear that we support our children learning about other cultures and traditions,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHowever, we do not agree with the forced participation in spiritual/religious practices without parents\u2019 written consent and further more believe that these types of practices do not have a place in the regular classroom curriculum.\u201d She said she was assured by the principal that parents would be notified of any other rites taking place on school property. Some four months later, Servatius said in her court filings, the school hosted another First Nations cultural event in which the performer began by reciting a prayer. Servatius is now seeking a court order to ban the school district from hosting any sort of religious exercise. None of the allegations have been proven in court. The case has been championed by Calgary-based Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a double standard,\u201d John Carpay of the organisation told the National Post. \u201cEither you allow religion in school and open the gates wide \u2013 and then you allow the Our Father prayer of Christians, roll out the prayer rugs and pray towards Mecca, and conduct an aboriginal spiritual smudging ceremony \u2013 or the door is closed and it is closed for everybody.\u201d While the school district declined to comment on the court petition, a letter from its lawyers included in court documents said the district denied that it had violated any rights and pointed out that its actions had not favoured one belief over any other. While the district acknowledged that a better job could have been done to inform parents and students that participation in the ceremony was optional, it was noted that the school principal had apologised to Servatius and a district-wide review of policies was underway. School districts in the province are mandated to include \u201cauthentic aboriginal content into the curriculum\u201d, the district\u2019s lawyers pointed out. The focus seeks to build on the recommendations of Canada\u2019s truth and reconciliation commission, which said last year that Canadian governments and churches had pursued a policy of \u201ccultural genocide\u201d by attempting to forcibly integrate 150,000 indigenous children through state-run schools rife with abuse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
