The ban will expire on May 18, meaning the 26-year-old forward will be able to play only the last two games of the current Serie A campaign. After the suspension the Romanian international said that he was considering quitting football. \"Chelsea have destroyed me,\" he said then. \"Now my career is in ruins. I might as well walk away from football.\" He dispensed with his agents Gica Popescu and Giovani Becali and signed a deal with an Italian management company led by Alessandro Moggi, the son of the Juventus managing director Luciano Moggi. Last month Mutu decided to start a rehabilitation programme and will be personally mentored by the former Arsenal defender Tony Adams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
