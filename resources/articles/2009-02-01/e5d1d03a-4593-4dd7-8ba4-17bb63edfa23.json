The government is entitled to nominate two non-executive directors to the board of Lloyds, created by the rescue of HBOS by Lloyds TSB. UK Financial Investments, the body set up by the government to manage its stakes in banks, controls 43% of Lloyds and will soon control 70% of Royal Bank of Scotland, where it can oversee the appointment of three new non-executives. The two new directors for Lloyds Banking Group are Tony Watson, the highly regarded former head of the Hermes pension fund management group, and Tim Ryan, chief executive of the US Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. This week the government is also expected to publish the formal terms of engagement for UKFI, which is intended to operate at arm's length from the Treasury. UKFI is expected to make it clear that it will exercise its votes at annual general meetings and wants to ensure that big City institutions \u2013 whose power has been reduced by the taxpayers' involvement \u2013 also continue to try to influence debate by casting their votes too. The body is also thought to have conducted an audit on how the bailed-out banks are performing in relation to the government's demand that they continue to lend to housebuyers and small businesses at 2007 levels. That progress report may also be published shortly. The new appointments to the Lloyds board are being made at a time when the industry is awaiting details of how the government's new insurance scheme for toxic assets will be constructed. RBS is a guinea pig for the scheme, which Lloyds is also expected to join. The Lloyds directors are also joining in the face of a possible row over potential pay rises for the boardroom bosses at the bank and demands for a speedy departure of the former HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby. He picks up \u00a360,000 a month in consultancy fees from the enlarged bank. Legal &amp; General is reported to be leading the calls for Hornby's early departure. The insurer refused to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
