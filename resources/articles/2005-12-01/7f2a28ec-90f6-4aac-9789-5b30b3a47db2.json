But a civil partnership is not the same as a marriage: although same-sex partners will soon be able to enjoy the same legal benefits as heterosexual couples, church groups continue to condemn homosexuality, and there is no guarantee that this latest step in the legal recognition of gay relationships will change the way society views gay people. The battle for gay rights mirrors other struggles for human rights in previous generations. An examination of the context of civil partnerships affords the perfect opportunity to consider the rights and responsibilities of British citizenship. The new law Begin by encouraging students to explore why couples choose to get married. The first civil partnership ceremonies in England will take place next Wednesday. Help younger students understand the Civil Partnership Act with reference to Stonewall's publication Getting Hitched, www.stonewall.org.uk/documents/get_hitched_a_guide_to_civil_partnership_english.pdf. Older students might prefer to browse the Women and Equality Unit site, www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk/civilpartnership.htm. Examine the rights conferred on legally recognised partners at www.theguardian.com/gayrights/story/0,,1577542,00.html and encourage students to consider some of the problems which previously faced gay couples. Interviews with couples at theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,,1644490,00.html provide a human perspective. Older students may be stimulated by Mark Vernon's comment on the differences between homosexual and heterosexual relationships at theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1602270,00.html. Equal rights Some commentators feel that true equality is still a long way off. Introduce pupils to the work of Stonewall at www.stonewall.org.uk. Some 82% of respondents to a Stonewall survey said they had suffered verbal bullying because of their sexuality at school. Visit www.stonewall.org.uk/education_for_all to access information and case studies about tackling homophobic bullying. KS4 students could compose a school anti-bullying charter. A visit to the gay insurance site Compass www.pinkinsurance.co.uk reveals how gay men are treated by corporations and institutions. Discuss the difference between legal and social equality. Ask groups of older pupils to create a collage of media representations of homosexuality, www.rainbownetwork.com/Film/detail.asp?iData=20830&amp;iCat=182&amp;iChannel=14&amp;nChannel=Film might be a good place to start. Discuss the role and responsibility of the media. Look at the lack of church involvement in the new partnerships. Find out more about the schism in the Church of England over the legitimacy of civil partnerships at www.theguardian.com/gayrights/story/0,12592,1646711,00.html. The pink pound The new law has created a huge market for wedding planners. Articles such as http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4476040.stm and http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4452540.stm feature profiles of the gay wedding shows now touring the country (www.gayweddingshow.co.uk). Encourage students to consider how the marketplace adapts to meet new demands by looking at two sites dedicated to providing rings, stationery and reception planning, www.pinkproducts.co.uk/gay-wedding-gay-wedding.html and www.moderncommitments.co.uk. Social and religious context Some local councils are eager to be seen as supportive: theguardian.com/gayrights/story/0,12592,1641640,00.html. Ask students to list the benefits Brighton and Westminster stand to gain by marketing themselves as gay-friendly. Sites such as www.catholic-ew.org.uk/topics/civilpartnerships.htm and www.cofe.anglican.org/news/pr5605.html provide statements from the major Christian churches on the legitimacy of civil partnerships. An interesting contrast is provided by Liberal Judaism, whose creation of a gay marriage service has met with disapproval from the Orthodox Jewish movement www.liberaljudaism.org/news_liturgypresscoverage.htm. An accessible guide to gay history is hosted at www.androphile.org, a site that also boasts an online library containing poetry, myth, biography and fiction themed around homosexual love.
