The findings once again draw attention to the links between Brazil\u2019s powerful beef industry and the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest, just as the world debates climate change at COP25. Responding to the work by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ), MEPs called on the EU to block beef which may be linked to deforestation. \u201cIt is absolutely urgent that the EU puts in place a legal duty on European companies to ensure that their supply chains are free of deforestation,\u201d said Heidi Hautala, a Finnish MEP. Two years ago Brazilian NGO Imazon collected data to estimate the beef buying zones throughout the Amazon. They identified 128 slaughterhouses, and set about establishing the areas from which these plants could feasibly buy their cattle for processing. Through phone interviews with staff at the abattoirs, or by taking averages based on methods at other meat plants, the research team gathered information on the maximum distances from which each would likely source cattle. They modelled this data against local factors such as roads, navigable rivers and weather patterns, and estimated the maximum potential buying zone for each slaughterhouse. The buying zones cover large areas of hundreds of km, and there is significant overlap between the buying zones for different companies. Added together, the data creates a compelling picture of the areas of the Amazon where cattle is being raised for beef. Using methods designed by the non-profit sustainability project Chain Reaction Research, the Guardian and the BIJ mapped Nasa fire alerts archive data on to the legally defined area of the Amazon and found that of the 554,000 alerts from July to September, nearly 376,000 \u2013 around 70% \u2013 were in the estimated buying zones, despite the fact that this area covers far less than half of the legal Amazon. Some of the world\u2019s biggest meat companies operate in the region. More than a quarter of a million fire alerts were issued in the estimated buying zones of JBS, the largest supplier of meat globally, for example. Its factories are known to export to Europe, including to UK companies. There were almost 80,000 fire alerts in the probable buying areas of Marfrig, the third largest Brazilian beef exporter, and more than 66,000 around abattoirs owned by Minerva. These three meatpackers dominate in Brazil\u2019s Amazon and account for nearly half of the cattle slaughtered in the region, according to Imazon. JBS, Marfrig and Minerva told the Bureau they were committed to \u201czero-deforestation\u201d supply chains, and that they all monitor their suppliers to ensure this. \u201cTheoretical correlation based on estimates is not causation and is misleading,\u201d a JBS spokesperson said. \u201cJBS is actively working to bring together other important stakeholders and companies to join forces to preserve the Amazon.\u201d The company added: \u201cIf farms are deemed non-compliant with our sustainable sourcing policies for any reason, including deforestation, they are blocked from our supply chain \u2026 We are not involved in, nor do we condone, the destruction of the Amazon.\u201d Marfrig also said it blocked any farms found to be involved in deforestation, and that it began monitoring fire outbreaks in August this year. \u201cWhenever any overlapping of areas between the properties and the fire outbreaks is identified, there is an alert for the purchase to be re-evaluated,\u201d it said. Minerva said there was no evidence it had bought animals from ranches where fires had occurred, and blamed this year\u2019s crisis on the weather. It said \u201cthere is no proven connection with agribusiness activities\u201d. In a separate investigation fires were also found on at least three farms known to sell cattle directly to JBS slaughterhouses. Working with Rep\u00f3rter Brasil, the BIJ found at least one of these plants exports beef and leather globally. While JBS, Marfrig and Minerva say they are confident that the cattle they buy do not come from illegally deforested areas, they also accept that they cannot know the origin of many because livestock are often moved between the thousands of breeding, raising and fattening ranches. The beef industry is seen as one of the major causes of deforestation in the wider Amazon region. Cattle ranchers are responsible for 80% of land clearing in every country with Amazon forest cover, according to the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. JBS, Minerva and Marfrig all admit they cannot monitor the ranches that feature further down their supply chains. \u201cAs of today, none of the players in the industry are able to trace indirect suppliers,\u201d said Minerva. Marfrig told the Bureau that more than half of the cattle it slaughters originate from these indirect suppliers. All three companies said they were working with the government or NGOs to address this blindspot in monitoring. JBS said: \u201cWe have been working with local authorities, government and wider industry to gain access to the data and tools required to address this issue.\u201d Marfrig said it requests cattle purchase information from its direct suppliers, while Minerva said that more law enforcement was needed at all stages in the chain. The Amazon fires this summer caused global alarm. There is no evidence that these fires were started on or by farms supplying JBS, Marfrig or Minerva, but the very existence of a patchwork of ranches in the rainforest could be helping to exacerbate the overall effect of fires started elsewhere. \u201cThe whole local climate is drier because you\u2019re getting less evaporation from the trees,\u201d said Yavinder Malhi, professor of ecosystem science at Oxford University. Experts say the increase in fires was directly caused by an increase in deforestation: the intentional burning of trees that had been felled months before, rather than random wildfires. \u201cOnce you clear forest to make a ranch, you have lots of dead materials lying around and then the farmers wait until the dry season to burn off that material,\u201d said Malhi. Deforestation has been a key issue at the climate change talks in Madrid, and prominent UK firms wrote to the Brazilian government last week to ask for urgent action. In response to the new findings MEPs Manon Aubry and Heidi Hautala have both called for action. \u201cIt cannot be the responsibility of a consumer to ensure that the products on European markets\u2019 shelves are sustainably produced,\u201d Hautala told the Guardian. \u201cThe consumer has to be able to trust that only responsibly produced items are sold in Europe.\u201d Aubry called for a rethink of the EU-Mercosur trade deal which would increase imports into Europe from Brazil and other South American countries. \u201cThe EU also has to question the impact of free trade agreements that are detrimental to both the planet and the people. A deal with the Mercosur would worsen the situation and accelerate deforestation in Amazonia.\u201d \u201cOur findings illustrate that fires and deforestation continue to take place in JBS\u2019s supply chain, despite the company\u2019s policies and commitments,\u201d said Marco Tulia Garcia, who led the research at Chain Reaction. \u201cIt is of the highest urgency that JBS addresses these issues.\u201d JBS recently took down a website that let customers search product codes for the name and coordinates of the last farm to rear the animal before slaughter, in a move described in the trade press as a reduction of transparency. Customers are now redirected to another site, where only the name and municipality of the ranches are provided. The company said: \u201cDue to legal concerns based on the Brazilian General Data Protection Regulation, the company limited some of the third party information posted on its website \u2026 JBS has a robust transparency policy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
