He was one of a growing number of distinguished academic economists with extensive experience of the business world keen to use this expertise in the policy arena. Geroski had been born and raised in the US but, having spent a year in Manchester as part of his studies at Bard College, New York state, he formed a lifelong attachment to this country. He settled permanently in the UK in 1975, first studying as an economics graduate at Warwick University, before establishing his reputation at Southampton University as a researcher and lecturer in industrial economics. He moved to the London Business School (LBS), where he was a professor of economics between 1991 and 2004 and also became dean of the school's MBA programme. It was during his time at the LBS that he first joined the MMC, and early inquiries on which he sat resulted in the break up of Milk Marque, the dominant supplier of milk in the UK, as well as an essentially clean bill of health for the supermarkets as being highly competitive in providing choice for consumers, accompanied by a powerful set of recommendations to limit abuse of their power in relation to their suppliers. Geroski brought an international perspective, original insights and a challenging approach to the competition scene. He was always open to new ideas and unstuffy, and he enjoyed stimulating debate - though rarely willing to concede unless counter arguments were watertight and met his exacting standards. He also demonstrated a powerful combination of detailed knowledge of competition in industry and absolute rigour of analysis, with a very relaxed and transparent style of probing in inquiries. It was no surprise, therefore, that, three years later, he became one of the MMC's two deputy chairman, whose main responsibility was to chair individual Inquiries. These covered a wide cross-section of UK industry, including telecommunications, a range of media mergers, transport, the ever-controversial beer industry and a large number of smaller mergers. Many of the UK's top industrialists had to experience his patient, though relentlessly penetrating, questioning, but virtually all felt that they had been treated fairly, transparently and with immense courtesy. More than a few privately admitted that they had gained significant new insight into their businesses as a result, and some even admitted to having rather enjoyed the whole process, irrespective of the outcome. In 2002, the Enterprise Act radically transformed the powers and procedures of organisation, which had by then become the Competition Commission. Geroski, as a deputy chairman, was heavily involved in this change, in particular by drawing up detailed guidance on the economic and business principles which the newly named body would apply to market and merger analysis. Such guidance to business, along with that of the Office of Fair Trading, was almost unprecedented in the UK at the time, and has proved both robust and a model for others to follow. His appointment as chairman in 2004 was widely welcomed. He very quickly embraced the new role and powers of the Competition Commission but remained committed to the virtues of openness, rigour and balance that had characterised all his previous work. He chaired two key inquiries, the first so-called market investigation under the new Act into store cards; and, until illness prevented him continuing, into the proposed mergers involving the London Stock Exchange. His experience and economic expertise saw him start to emerge as a frontline figure among the main competition authorities around the world and, shortly before he died, the Competition Commission was judged by the Global Competition Review to be, along with its opposite numbers in the US, the most effective such body in the world. Ironically, for someone with such a natural gift for easy communication on difficult and controversial economic issues, Geroski initially found dealing with the media quite troublesome. He was always a quite outstandingly effective and popular lecturer, but his inherent preference for dialogue and debate did not sit comfortably with the demands of the carefully constructed soundbite or the 30-second summary. However, he soon developed this skill as well, and was a powerful advocate for the myriad benefits of intense and pervasive competition in generating free and effective markets. His wife, Alice, and their two children survive him. \u00b7 Paul Andrew Geroski, economist, born October 18 1952; died August 28 2005"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
