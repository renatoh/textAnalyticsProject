Caused the death of six people, three of them murdered. And caused a multi-millionaire to fall in love with a service station waitress, but not have the courage to leave his wife; plus two police officers who used to have a thing together get their thing together back again. Powerful little things, aren't they? I should have known \u2013 one flew into my crash helmet the other day. I just managed to stop and pull it off before I caused my own pile-up with multiple fatalities and the inevitable subsequent unearthing of large-scale corporate wrong-doing, people-smuggling, murder and the like. And we did, in fact, see it \u2013 the wasp \u2013 in the first episode, at the service station. The pretty waitress tried to take her frustration at having a rubbish boyfriend out on the wasp by swatting it, but she missed. So then it buzzed off, chased a car travelling at 70 miles an hour, flew in through the window, upset the paedophile piano teacher, who turned out not to be a paedophile but a trekkie, and made him cause a horrendous crash with multiple vehicles, multiple fatalities and multiple repercussions. It wasn't just the piano teacher I was wrong about. The antiques dealer wasn't bringing drugs over from Holland in a secret compartment in his van, but Africans. Fitting then, that he should end up in a car crusher himself. Collision was intriguing and gripping and ambitious and a bit daft, all at the same time. There was so much going on, so much build-up, that it couldn't help leaving you feeling empty at the end, falling a bit flat. The wasp thing was just a bit irritating. But not quite as annoying as the alternative ending \u2013 the one where the waitress got the wasp after all. So it didn't then go and bother the trekkie-not-paedo piano teacher, so he didn't swerve, the accident never happened, none of the murders took place, the Africans arrived safely, and the cops never re-copped off with each other. Did it happen, or not? Or are we now meant to go and ponder the randomness of chance or fate or something? Hmmm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
