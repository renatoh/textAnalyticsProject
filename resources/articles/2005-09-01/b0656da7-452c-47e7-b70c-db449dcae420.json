Subhaan Younis, 23, was staying in Glasgow's Moat House Hotel last September when he showed Charlotte McClay footage he had downloaded from the internet. The court heard that Younis, of Glasgow, who last month was found guilty of a breach of the peace, showed Ms McClay the clip during a conversation about the war in the Iraq. His defence solicitor, Dominic Sellar, told Glasgow district court that his client had offered to show her something that would cause her a \"sleepless night\". Mr Sellar said Younis took her response of \"Aye, right\" to mean that she understood that she was about to see a video of a hostage being executed. But the magistrate told Younis that Ms McClay, who worked at the hotel, had been \"shocked, upset and frightened\" by the clip and could be affected \"perhaps for the rest of her life\". Passing sentence, he said: \"You chose to let her view the images on your telephone and told her that she might have nightmares. In my view, the woman had no idea about what she was about to view. No reasonable person might have anticipated viewing such dreadful and distressing images in such circumstances.\" He added: \"I struggle to understand why any decent individual would have images showing the degradation and death of another human being.\" Mr Sellar told the court that his client realised he had made a \"colossal mistake\" and that he had behaved \"naively, foolishly and stupidly.\" He said Younis accepted that the images were \"abhorrent and shocking in the extreme.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
