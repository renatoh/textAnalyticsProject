Roberts, who has written both Doctor Who TV episodes and books in the past, revealed the news himself on Tuesday in a lengthy post on Medium. He said that he had been commissioned to write the story, and had submitted it. When news of his contribution was leaked online, \u201ca section\u201d of the Doctor Who fandom \u201cagitated\u201d for his removal, and other contributors threatened to withdraw if he was involved. \u201cBBC Books immediately folded to these demands, and I was informed that although I would be paid, my story would not be published, as they judged \u2013 wrongly, in my opinion \u2013 that a potential boycott would make the book \u2018economically unviable\u2019,\u201d wrote Roberts. The gay author said the protests were down to two tweets he had made about the transgender community that he described as \u201ccheerful vulgarity\u201d. In 2017, he wrote: \u201cI love how trannies choose names like Munroe, Paris and Chelsea. It\u2019s never Julie or Bev is it?\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a clueless gayboy\u2019s idea of a glamorous lady. But of course it\u2019s definitely not that.\u201d Doctor Who: The Target Storybook is due out in October from Ebury Publishing imprint BBC Books, featuring contributions from authors including Jenny T Colgan, Susie Day, Terrance Dicks and Matthew Sweet. Ebury confirmed on Wednesday that it would no longer feature Roberts\u2019s work. A spokeswoman added: \u201cComments made by the author on social media using offensive language about the transgender community have caused upset to Doctor Who fans and conflict with our values as a publisher.\u201d The decision has caused a storm on Twitter, with Roberts supported by names including Julie Bindel and Toby Young. Susie Day admitted she was one of the anthology authors to have protested about Roberts\u2019 inclusion, saying that \u201cbeing involved felt like a tacit endorsement of his views\u201d. \u201cI raised my concerns, and said if he was in, I was out,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBBC Books made their decision. I\u2019m grateful they took the opportunity to demonstrate that transphobic views have no place in the Whoniverse, both in and outside the stories.\u201d Bethany Black, the first trans actor in Doctor Who, also applauded the decision. In his Medium post, Roberts said he does not believe in gender identity, adding: \u201cIt is impossible for a person to change their biological sex. I don\u2019t believe anybody is born in the wrong body. \u201cLike every other reasonable person I deplore and condemn any violence, intimidation or discrimination against any person for their beliefs or for how they present themselves, or indeed any other reason,\u201d wrote Roberts. \u201cI\u2019ve rejected restrictive cultural gender stereotypes for as long as I can remember. I consider them to be very often harmful and constricting, especially for girls and women. The culture I enjoy most and the artists I like most are people who laugh at, bend and play with these roles.\u201d He finished by asking if BBC Books was planning to pull writing from authors including Julie Burchill, Graham Linehan, Martina Navratilova and Germaine Greer, who have also drawn criticism from the transgender community for their views."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
