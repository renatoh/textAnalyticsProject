Speaking publicly for the first time since the controversy erupted, the England bowler said dismissively: \u201cWe\u2019ve got more important things to worry about than someone\u2019s book.\u201d Anderson rejected the claims of a divided dressing room. \u201cThe issues that have been brought up are sad really,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dressing room for the seven or eight years we were winning and successful was fantastic. You don\u2019t achieve what we did during that period without all the guys pulling in the same direction. \u201cI can\u2019t get my head round it. He [Pietersen] seems like he has not enjoyed it for any of the time he was there, but we all enjoyed it.\u201d In response to a question about whether or not in the future dressing room issues could stay in house and not be played out in public like this, Anderson replied: \u201cI\u2019d like to think they could stay in house. This is not an ideal situation but it\u2019s different with Kev. He never got a chance to stand up for himself in the dressing room because the opportunity to be in the dressing room was taken away from him by the powers that be. He is now venting his frustration through a book.\u201d Anderson was speaking alongside Pietersen\u2019s former team-mates Matthew Hoggard, Paul Collingwood and Simon Jones. The former England, Hampshire and Glamorgan bowler Jones, who was part of the 2005 Ashes-winning team, moved to defend Pietersen. \u201cFor Kev to come out and say the things he has there must be some truth behind it. We will see what happens over the next couple of weeks. I am sure Matty Prior will come back at him. But I think at the moment, Kev is the happiest man in the world because he\u2019s selling books, the press have done him a massive favour and Twitter has gone bonkers and he\u2019s a happy man,\u201d Jones said. There was little sympathy forPietersen from fellow 2005 Ashes-winner Matthew Hoggard, who described Kevin as being \u201cvery bitter\u201d. \u201cI think he is getting a lot of his anger out and it\u2019s fantastic way of selling books before Christmas,\u201d Hoggard said. Asked if he thought Pietersen had any grounds for his bitterness, Hoggard replied: \u201cIn relation to the Twitter account that wasn\u2019t investigated properly but everything else I think he\u2019s brought on himself and he\u2019s just being a kiddy in a schoolground.\u201d Paul Collingwood, about whom Pietersen talks fondly in his book, was also fairly unsympathetic. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand all of this to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last seven years has been fantastic for English cricket. KP has done a lot for English cricket but also English cricket has done a lot for KP. This is one man\u2019s opinion against everyone else\u2019s. This was one of the most successful teams in English history \u2013 three Ashes wins, No1 Test status, a World T20 cup, a series win in India. If you think the England dressing room was as divided as he says, there\u2019s no fucking chance we\u2019d have won any of those things, let me tell you.\u201d Jimmy Anderson was speaking at a Hardys event at Lord\u2019s.
