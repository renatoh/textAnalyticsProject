When I was there last August, my friends and I were walking down the main street to our hotel in Kuta when a guy on a motorbike tried to snatch my Indonesian friend's bag from her shoulder in broad daylight. We also found that when we wanted peace and quiet on the beach we were constantly pestered by hawkers trying to sell us everything under the sun. Don't let this advice deter you, though; there are many great things to experience when you are there, as I am sure you will find out for yourself. If there is one last piece of information that I could give you, it is to stay away from the satay turtle, as they are endangered and killed in the most atrocious of ways."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
