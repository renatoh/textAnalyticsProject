We're a very good side and we just enjoy playing. We know what we've got and we'll work at it, and we go into every game looking to win it.\" Most of Pardew's backroom staff have Colchester on their CVs, although the ambitions of the two clubs could not be more different right now. Charlton have two parachute payment loaded seasons to get back to the Premier League; United have to hang on to their better players until the new 10,000-seat stadium at Cuckoo Farm - with the option to eventually double that capacity - is finished in the summer, and then try to expand. Work started in July and was stepped up when the steel was delivered last week, although it was the players' efforts to gain a first home win of the season that provided most of the talking points on Saturday evening. Colchester took the lead when Mark Yeates exchanged passes with Teddy Sheringham and fired in a low shot from close range and they quickly went two up when Lisbie met a corner and headed in his third goal in four games for them. Andy Reid, given a breather after playing an unexpected 90 minutes for the Republic of Ireland against the Czech Republic on Wednesday in place of the Walter Mitty-like Stephen Ireland, was warming up when Chris Iwelumo - 37 goals for Colchester in two seasons and a free-transfer signing for Charlton in the summer - nodded the ball down for another new boy, Svetoslav Todorov, to fire home. Reid came on for the second half and soon slipped a pass through for Iwelumo but he was brought down by the last man Matt Connolly, who was dismissed on the say so of a linesman. It was the start of a forgettable hour for the on-loan Arsenal centre-back, who was randomly called up for a drug test after the final whistle. Luke Varney was next to leave the Charlton bench and he had a header blocked in a melee. It fell for Zheng Zhi to cap a fine performance with the equaliser, although the home side had the better chances after that and it took a fine save from Nicky Weaver to deny Lisbie his second of the afternoon. \"I didn't score many goals for Charlton and I was getting a bit of abuse from the fans, so it was good to get one today,\" Lisbie said. \"It would have been nice to get the winner, too. That would have made my year. It is nothing to do with my ex-team-mates or the boss, he was only there for a year and we left on good terms. I just wanted to play against them. I've got a lot of friends in that team and it was good to be out there. I've still got a lot of love for Charlton and the management.\" So far so good for Pardew, who has been in this situation before although it took him two seasons to get a rebuilt West Ham promoted in 2005 after the club had been forced to sell their best, but with this point his Charlton side moved quietly if fortuitously into fifth place with home games due against Norwich City tomorrow and Leicester on Saturday. \"Colchester is an easy place to lose at but there were a lot of things in our play today that were not good enough for this club,\" he said. \"I don't care how early in the season it is, the players were too sloppy. It's something we'll have to address.\" Man of the match Mark Yeates (Colchester United)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
