The oil executive - who was dismissed from his post after admitting that the Anglo-Dutch group had over-reported its reserves by almost a quarter - is still being investigated by the Financial Services Authority. But after months of silence, Sir Philip came out fighting by lodging a case with the Financial Services and Markets Tribunal over the way the regulator dealt with his case when it slapped a \u00a317m fine on Shell for misleading the stock market. The move comes as the FSA faces a rising number of appeals against its decisions. It is mired in a dispute with Legal &amp; General over a \u00a31.1m fine for alleged endowment mis-selling. Sir Philip's comments were made through his lawyers at Herbert Smith. \"The FSA violated my statutory rights to review and rebut the allegations contained in their recently published notice against Shell, because I was both identified and prejudiced by the publication,\" he said. By going to the tribunal, Sir Philip is ensuring that the events surrounding the misstating of Shell's oil reserves will be aired publicly. Shell is unlikely to welcome the move by Sir Philip. It is trying to draw a line under the reserves fiasco, which damaged its reputation and share price. It remains unclear whether Sir Philip - if victorious - could challenge his exit from the oil company. He was not mentioned directly by name in the FSA report on Shell, but he points out that the matters centre on periods when he was in charge of the company. He said that newspaper reports about the FSA document identified him as an allegedly guilty party. Six months after he left the oil company and a month after the FSA imposed its record fine, Sir Philip said: \"I look forward to the time when I will have an opportunity to publicly address these matters.\" He was adamant that \"a full and fair examination of all the facts will demonstrate I have acted properly and in good faith at all times\". In a detailed submission to the tribunal, Sir Philip's lawyer - Martyn Hopper, a former senior employee at the FSA - said his client had been denied the chance to have his say on the conclusions of the inquiry. In an investigation conducted over four months - unusually fast for the regulator - the FSA concluded that there had been \"unprecedented misconduct\" by Shell. Sir Philip blamed the FSA's \"haste\" for flouting his right to put his side of the story. He said it was particularly \"egregious\" because the limited investigation meant the findings were \"flawed\". But he also engaged in a line by line rebuttal of what he saw as the main charges against Shell and, by implication, himself. Last night, a spokesman for the oil group said: \"We are aware of Sir Philip's actions, but in the light of the ongoing investigation we can't make any comment.\" The FSA refused to comment on the Shell case but defended itself on the issue of the rising number of appeals to the tribunal, which was set up three years ago. Sir Philip's action takes the number of appeals so far this year to 24. Last year 23 were made in the whole of the year. The FSA said: \"We don't regard the rising number of references to the tribunal as a problem. It's indicative of the FSA's increased workload.\" The US securities and exchange commission fined Shell $120m (\u00a366m) over the reserves scandal. War of words What Sir Philip Watts's appeal document says in response to FSA charges: FSA: Shell's announcements of proved reserves from early 1998 to 2003 were false or misleading, in that it knew or ought to have known the reserves were non-compliant with securities and exchange commission rule 4-10 in America. Sir Philip: \"To apply rule 4-10, which defines proved reserves as those 'estimated quantities' of oil and gas 'reasonably certain' to be recoverable ... requires inherently subjective judgments by oil and gas producers.\" FSA: Shell failed to put in place or maintain adequate internal guidelines and adequate internal controls. Sir Philip: \"Reviews undertaken within Shell of its own internal guidelines for assessing proved reserves, included assurance from Shell's EP (exploration and production) business and from Shell's external auditors that the guidelines complied with SEC requirements.\" FSA: A reserve-replacement ratio of 37% given during a presentation to a January 31 2000 meeting of exploration management was \"robustly rejected\" and on April 11 a ratio of 56% was announced. Sir Philip: \"This is unfair and misleading in that it suggests that the applicant [Sir Philip] disregarded the 37% not on the merits but out of a desire simply to report a higher ratio figure.\" FSA: Shell had been indulging in \"reverse engineering\" to support its Nigerian reserves expectations. Sir Philip: \"Contrary to the FSA's findings, the presentation contains no reference to production forecasts in Nigeria being reverse engineered solely to support reserves figures.\" FSA: Shell did not follow warnings in 2002 and 2003 that its disclosed proved reserves were false or misleading. Sir Philip: \"To the extent that any concerns were expressed ... about Shell's reserves, the applicant acted appropriately and in good faith in addressing those concerns.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
