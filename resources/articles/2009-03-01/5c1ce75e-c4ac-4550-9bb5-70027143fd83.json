The two digits on Gerrard's jersey are purely notional, though he is so close to being England's first Total Footballer that he did serve up a cameo as a left-winger for his country's opening goal. When Wayne Rooney caressed a pass into the Slovakian right-back's channel six minutes into this match, Gerrard pirouetted and clipped the ball across the face of the goal for Emile Heskey to score. Liverpool's rampaging captain is even giving Stewart Downing lessons now. It was, though, only a flying visit to the winger's office. Gerrard never applied to be Chris Waddle, who was surely right to complain this week that an obsession with two-touch-pass-and-move has deprived the English game of ball-carriers who attack and surge past defenders. When the whistle sounded Gerrard's first act was to leave the Ryan Giggs position and jog into the centre. This pretty much billboarded his intentions. \"Start on the left, then go wherever the hell you like\" is not standard coaching wisdom, but Gerrard can pull it off for two sound reasons. One is that Wayne Rooney is so versatile and such an intelligent user of vacant areas that he often probes the left-hand flank for England and Manchester United anyway. This gives Gerrard his release papers, not that he feels the need to get them stamped. The other justification is that it would be a criminal waste of attacking talent to confine a player in such dazzling form to a line-hugging role on his weaker side. In his 45 minutes on the field Gerrard appeared at left-wing, right-wing, inside-right, inside-left and withdrawn striker. His positional understanding with Rooney is among Fabio Capello's strongest assets as he gnaws away at the old problem of how to turn Premier League big shots into international heavyweights. Sweet notes are pouring from Gerrard's violin, so the natural inclination is to let him play until he drops the instrument. A counter-balancing thought, though, is that running around, puppy-like, against Slovakia (or even Ukraine on Wednesday night) will not transfer to contests against Spain, Brazil or Argentina, who would look to exploit his peripatetic urges by attacking the space he evacuates. In the debating salons all talk seems to return to Stevie G and the need to just let him Stevie Be. Jimmy Greaves said the other day: \"Steven Gerrard is the nearest thing I have seen to the late, great Busby Babe, Duncan Edwards.\" The praise piles higher than the Wembley arch. Possibly the world's best player, said Zinedine Zidane, very roughly paraphrased. But then Gerrard steps out and an old conundrum sits up and yells: how do England get him to perform as he does at Anfield, his Old Vic? Death by plane crash is hardly comparable to Gerrard's mostly underwhelming international career. Edwards, described as a \"colossus\" by his contemporaries, was snatched away at 21. But the Greaves comparison deepens the mystery of what has happened to Gerrard between him leaving Liverpool and striding into the England camp. Was he kidnapped and replaced by an impostor at Knutsford Services? At Liverpool, his freedom to maraud is upheld by the presence of two authentic screening midfielders in Javier Mascherano and Xabi Alonso. With six defensively minded players behind, Gerrard can feel the wind in his hair. Here, with England, Gareth Barry and Frank Lampard occupy the central roles. Barry is an ex-defender and competent hunter-gatherer, but Lampard is a ground-devouring opportunist from the Liverpool idol's school. In his early days some of the game's best judges thought Gerrard's big flaw was ruinous positional indiscipline. The crowd, they argued, would clap him into an unoccupied sector of the field without noticing that he had just vacated the space he was meant to be filling. In a losing Liverpool side, this could be cast as self-indulgence. In one that beats Real Madrid 5-0 on aggregate, or Manchester United 4-1, it takes us back to a vanished golden era of free spirits lighting up the pitch. Tactical rigour killed those days. Capello should know, because he is one its best exponents. Italian thinking can just about accommodate one player who floats where he likes, but only if the defensive structure behind him is impregnable. The only place to find that out is at a World Cup or European Championship when England run up against one of the countries that routinely send them home in big knock-out games. For now, Capello has pulled off the trick of denying the Premier League's most potent player a starting place in his best position, while persuading him that to be thrown the problem No 11 shirt is no insult. Gerrard was approaching 70 caps (he has 71 now) before the puzzle was half-solved. It's the man that counts in the end, not his number."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
