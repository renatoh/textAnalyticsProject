Not since Edinburgh 1986 have England emerged on top at the Commonwealth Games \u2013 when golds for Steve Redgrave, Roger Black, Steve Cram and Sarah Hardcastle ensured that they sat narrowly above Canada in the standings \u2013 yet in the afterglow of London 2012 that feat is set to be repeated, barring a remarkable turnaround. At the end of competition on Friday, England had eight more golds and 16 more medals than their nearest rivals, who had been in front following a series of impressive performances in swimming and cycling. However, although Australia\u2019s women are favourites to overcome England in the hockey final and other Australians still harbour hopes of gold, their week has been dogged with controversy. The weightlifter Francois Etoundi, who had won a bronze medal, was ordered to pay \u00a3400 by Glasgow sheriff court for headbutting and breaking the nose of his Welsh rival Gareth Evans on Wednesday. Etoundi spent a night in custody following the incident at the athletes\u2019 village and has been kicked out of the Australian team. That came one day after Australia\u2019s head athletics coach, Eric Hollingsworth, was kicked off the team and sent home following an unauthorised public statement criticising the athlete Sally Pearson, with whom he shares a frosty relationship. The Australia team chief, Steve Moneghetti, said he was disappointed but not embarrassed by the incidents, while earlier in the week, following the conclusion of his country\u2019s strongest sports, he said medals were not the only important thing in Glasgow. He said: \u201cWhile the success of the swimming and track cycling comes to an end \u2026 it\u2019s a great opportunity to focus on some other sports. It\u2019s not about medal winning.\u201d Australia knocked England off the top of the medal table on Sunday but, while the antipodeans prevailed in a fiercely contested women\u2019s netball match earlier in the Games, the green and gold surge at Tollcross and at the velodrome has slowed in recent days. What may be of concern is the range of sports that have proved successful for Australia, with cycling, swimming and shooting accounting for the vast majority of their medals. England are expected to secure a number of medals in the boxing finals with fighters including Nicola Adams already guaranteed silver. It is a similar story as the squash draws to a denouement, while Lizzie Armitstead could take a medal in Sunday\u2019s cycling road race and Tom Daley makes his second appearance of the Games in the diving on Saturday night. England have three of the four pairings in the table tennis mixed doubles semi-finals and are therefore guaranteed two medals, while there could be further successes on the track at Hampden Park in the relay sprints. There have been a number of impressive displays from Australia\u2019s team in the last nine days and some encouragingsigns that their malaise from London 2012 \u2013 when they finished 10th in the medal table with 35 \u2013 is slowly being turned around. However, their Commonwealth hegemony could be drawing to a close. Alex Dowsett, after winning gold for England in Thursday\u2019s time trial, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just nice to get one over on the Aussies. They seem to be ruling the roost when it\u2019s come to the cycling.\u201d As Wayne Smith of the newspaper the Australian wrote: \u201cIn the Commonwealth Games Ashes contest against England, Australia is nine wickets down in its second innings on a seaming wicket and James Anderson has the second new ball in his hand. In short, the end is nigh.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
