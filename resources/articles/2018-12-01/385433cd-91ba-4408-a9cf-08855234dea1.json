Shock was rawly evident on the face of the then 20-year-old, who campaigned against child labour on her return home before her first documentary was commissioned by Danny Cohen, then controller at BBC Three. The channel has since aired investigations by Dooley into everything from Mexico\u2019s drug war to the sexualisation of Japanese girls. Cohen, who went on to be the BBC\u2019s director of television, had advised her to eschew a conventional journalistic persona in favour of her own natural empathy. Fast forward 10 years to exposure of a very different kind in the form of her victory in this year\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing on BBC One and it\u2019s clear Dooley\u2019s ability to connect with as big an audience as it gets on terrestrial television makes her a force to be reckoned with. At a time when young, female faces from working-class backgrounds are at a premium in television, not least at the BBC, the broadcasting world is her oyster after years of building up a dedicated fanbase among younger viewers. \u201cShe is just very warm and creates a very human connection with interviewees,\u201d said David Fuller, a journalist and film-maker who has worked with Dooley on productions including 2016\u2019s investigation into the Russian sex trade. \u201cShe was already a kind of celebrity at that point. I haven\u2019t watched Strictly so I don\u2019t know if she has shown this, but she is also very self-aware and very amusing. She would joke from time to time and point at herself, saying: \u2018Face of a generation, Dave, face of a generation\u2019.\u201d Dooley\u2019s own wry self-deprecation about her marketability aside, casting this year\u2019s winner of the BBC\u2019s flagship entertainment show as a breakout star is somewhat off the mark. But while some ask: \u201cWhere has she come from?\u201d the BBC Three controller, Damian Kavanagh, speaks glowingly of a talent that he says has been \u201cdeveloping and growing for some time\u201d. \u201cWe have worked with a lot of people who have come through a non-traditional route\u201d \u2013 [rapper] Professor Green [who presented a film about suicide for BBC Three] is another \u2013 so it\u2019s quite odd when people ask that, because she has made nearly 60 films.\u201d Strictly Come Dancing attracted a peak of 12.7 million viewers for Saturday night\u2019s final as Dooley and her professional partner, Kevin Clifton, emerged as the people\u2019s champions in a vote following three months of competition. Despite scoring lower among the judges than fellow finalists Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer \u2013 both of whom have music backgrounds \u2013 Dooley had been widely tipped as favourite alongside the fourth finalist, YouTube star Joe Sugg. Her reply to to the question of how she planned to celebrate was classic Dooley: \u201cGo to McDonald\u2019s. I\u2019m starving,\u201d as was a subsequent tweet that made light of a so-called \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve won Strictly and flashed my knickers. A perfect Sat night,\u201d she told her more than 234,000 followers. To fans, it\u2019s the type of language that reflects her down to earth Luton roots, a town to which she returned in 2013 to make a documentary about extremism, at one point interviewing the far right figure Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2013 who calls himself Tommy Robinson \u2013 whom she spoke of knowing when growing up. Dooley, who left school at 16, is spoken of by broadcasting colleagues as being instinctively \u201cstreetwise\u201d, an asset also seemingly married with steely determination. \u201cShe is tenacious and she is charming,\u201d said one, who spoke of Dooley catching malaria while shooting in the early days of her career in the Ivory Coast, returning again after recovering in the UK. \u201cShe can charm her way out of trouble or into wherever she needs to be, whether it\u2019s with the driver of the jeep, a shy 12-year-old interviewee or a menacing government official.\u201d Dooley spoke of her own candid style during an interview with the Observer: \u201cYou have to be brave and ask the questions on the tip of your tongue. Sometimes, you\u2019re cringeing inside. But you can\u2019t have people screaming at the screen the question you didn\u2019t have the balls to ask.\u201d A more cynical reading among some industry watchers has, meanwhile, viewed this year\u2019s Strictly, and previous episodes of ITV\u2019s I\u2019m a Celebrity\u2026 as a classic tactic to introduce potential future stars into the mainstream. It\u2019s a view at odds with the reality of Dooley\u2019s appeal as told by Kavanagh, who said she has \u201ca whole tranche of fans who are literally waiting for a new documentary by her to drop on iPlayer\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s also subject matter [she covers] that you probably would not think might appeal to [those] groups. Quite chewy stuff,\u201d he said, citing Dooley\u2019s live shows as another example of her appeal. \u201cI went to one in London a few months ago and it was basically packed to the rafters with young men and women who were in thrall to her as she spoke, and when there were questions afterwards, every one of them started off by telling her how much she had changed their lives.\u201d While Dooley\u2019s next steps will be closely watched, Kavanagh pointed out that she has already worked on a number of films for BBC One and has further titles on the way with BBC Three. Her appeal has been clear for some time. Last year\u2019s documentary on young DUP members \u2013 suddenly relevant again to UK politics \u2013 was one of the most-watched programmes for a period last year on iPlayer, as visible a gauge of popularity as one might find. Will success change her? The bets are very much against that happening. \u201cShe is basically extremely down to earth and decent,\u201d added Fuller. \u201cIn fact, the only difficulty we had in Russia with her was that she didn\u2019t like using the lift. You could read into that what you will, but the truth is that she is claustrophobic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
