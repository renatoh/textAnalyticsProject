Mr Bush said that the meeting, which happened the day after he had launched his bid to patch up transatlantic relations with a key speech to the UN general assembly, had been positive. The president said he had told Mr Schr\u00f6der \"we have had differences - they are over, and we're going to work together\". Mr Schr\u00f6der, one of the most outspoken critics of the war in Iraq, renewed a German offer to help train Iraqi police and security personnel. He told reporters after the meeting that he had said Germany \"would like to come in and help with the resources that we have\". \"We both agree that we want to look into the future together. It is very important, not just for Iraq, but for the whole of the region, for Germany and therefore for the whole of Europe,\" he said. However, there was no indication that Germany would contribute peacekeeping troops, as it has in Afghanistan, or that Mr Schr\u00f6der would retract his support for France's call for a quick end to the US occupation of Iraq. Mr Bush, who is struggling to find international support, said: \"I appreciate his efforts to help Iraq grow to be a peaceful, stable and democratic country.\" Apart from two handshakes, one at an economic conference last spring and another in Prague last November, it was the first formal meeting between the two leaders for more than a year. The talks were markedly warmer than had been the case when Mr Bush yesterday met the French president, Jaques Chirac, and the two continued to disagree on Iraq. Mr Bush's diplomatic push was set to continue today with a meeting with President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, and the Indian prime minster, Atal Behari Vajpayee. In Iraq, meanwhile, the difficulties facing the stretched US mission were again highlighted by a series of bomb attacks. A roadside bomb apparently aimed at US troops tore through two commuter buses in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, killing one Iraqi and wounding around 20. In the northern city of Mosul, a blast ripped through a cinema, causing several casualties, local people said. Shopkeepers said that they saw around 20 people carried out of the building, some with very serious wounds. Three Iraqi police officers were recovering in hospital from another incident overnight, in which they said that a US soldier was also wounded, while elsewhere in the city troops sealed off a road tunnel to deal with explosives found there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
