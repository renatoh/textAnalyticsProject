At his school, Hastingsbury Business and Enterprise College in Bedford, students are invited to many of the decision-making functions. These range from students interviewing potential teachers, attending governor meetings and taking part in working groups to improve student behaviour. \"There is so much more you can do at Hastingsbury,\" says Pavandeep Jhand, a year 10 student. \"You have the opportunity to help teachers through action research and other students with peer listening. In other schools, you just do fundraising.\" Hastingsbury is part of a county-wide initiative, the Bedfordshire School Improvement Partnership (BSIP), which has been working on student voice initiatives long before the child-centred ECM agenda came into play. \"All schools in Bedfordshire are part of the partnership and about 85% are actively involved,\" says Brian Roberts, BSIP student voice consultant team manager. \"We've employed six gap-year students to train teachers across Bedfordshire on student voice and work with pupils to create effective schools councils.\" \"Some schools only have two pupils on a student council,\" says Ashnil Momi, a year 11 student at Hastingsbury. \"Our student council has members for each year group and there is a larger group that represents every student voice group in the school.\" The work in Bedfordshire has sparked interest from around the country. \"We're currently talking to Leicestershire and Northumberland about our work,\" says Roberts. \"We're also sharing best practice in student voice with Bolton local authority in a DfES Next Practice project.\" Children first It's only recently that the educational landscape has shifted to a more child-centred focus. ECM is the driver - the five outcomes (be healthy, stay safe, enjoy and achieve, make a positive contribution, and achieve economic wellbeing) were originally designed by children. Many schools have started to realise student voice is the key to achieving ECM. \"Student voice has been neglected to date but that is starting to change since Every Child Matters,\" says Sarah Brown, spokesperson for the English Secondary Students' Association (Essa). As well as ECM, the DfES published guidance in April 2004 called Working together: Giving Children and Young People a Say. It recommended the introduction of student voice initiatives, and Ofsted inspections now include pupil consultation. An Ofsted spokesperson said: \"Inspectors seek pupils' views when conducting an inspection ... When talking to learners, inspectors find out about the degree to which the school seeks and acts upon their views.\" In Scandinavia, student involvement is commonplace. Pupils in Finland participate actively in decision-making within schools, and at local, regional and national levels through a national school pupils' organisation. Something is working because Finland has topped the worldwide tables in maths, mother tongue and science. Lord Adonis, the schools minister, recently visited Finland and he told the Commons education select committee: \"One of the things I was very struck by is the degree of pupil participation in the schools. School governing bodies now routinely in Finland have pupils as full members. That is something we don't have here.\" Since September 2003, students have been allowed to be associate members of school governing bodies. Student members can attend full governing body meetings and be members of governing body committees, but they have no voting rights. However, not many schools have taken this up and it isn't compulsory. It is believed student voice encourages citizenship, which helps children achieve their potential as set out in ECM. Citizenship education became compulsory four years ago but Ofsted says it is taught inadequately in a quarter of schools. Involving pupils can be a powerful way for them to experience citizenship. \"Encouraging school involvement in school decisions is one step towards reducing political apathy among young people,\" says Hannah Couchman, West Midlands deputy representative at Essa. The Citizenship Foundation believes greater pupil participation can often lead to better exam results. \"When schools take the apparently radical step of having pupils on interviewing panels and governing bodies, none of the schools we know about has ever gone back,\" says chief executive Tony Breslin. Pros and cons In 2006, the Esm\u00e9e Fairbairn Foundation and the Carnegie UK Trust commissioned research into the impact of student participation. The research found students in more democratic schools were happier and felt more in control of their learning. Where students gave feedback on teaching, teachers' practice was improved and students gained awareness of the learning process, plus student behaviour improved. Despite the benefits, not everyone is a fan. Some feel pupil power could undermine teachers' authority and escalate behaviour problems. \"Teachers can feel very threatened at the thought of being evaluated by their own students,\" says Brown. \"Websites are cropping up such as ratemyteachers.com, but students wouldn't post on these sites if they had a voice in their own learning.\" \"Some teachers are nervous when they know I'm going to observe them,\" says Pavandeep. \"But as soon as we talk about it, everything's fine. It's important to explain that you're looking for good things as well as things they can improve.\" Sue Attard, head at Lark Rise lower school in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, thinks student voice is a cultural shift for teachers. \"We have lost staff who cannot adjust to our culture of student voice ... Teachers are not going to be fully behind student voice if they feel they have no say in decisions. You have to start off by creating a culture where all staff feel they have a voice.\" Attard says she has now achieved a culture shift. \"Student voice is vital to making every child feel safe at our school. Students have undertaken research into what makes a happy classroom and who they would go to if they didn't have a friend in the playground.\" Ingrid Cox, assistant head at Rivington and Blackrod high school in Bolton, agrees a culture shift is needed: \"A lot of adults say, 'We don't have a voice so why should young people?' You have to start small, you can't change the culture overnight. It's about constantly asking, 'What can our young people do, how can they be involved in this?'\" Another government drive is to personalise learning and many believe this is impossible without listening to learners. Thinktank Futurelab has recently published a handbook on learner voice that outlines a number of benefits,such as improved thinking skills, highly engaged students, and better relationships between students and teachers. Tim Rudd, senior researcher at Futurelab, says: \"Students need to actively participate in setting their own learning agenda so that they become fully engaged in the learning process.\" Student involvement in learning can mean more than evaluating lessons. \"At Hastingsbury, our post-16 students provide academic mentoring to younger students. They also mentor students on alcohol, sex and drugs,\" says Kane. \"It's more powerful for our students to learn how to stay sexually healthy from an older student rather than an external expert.\" What do pupils think? Pavandeep is aware her school gives her more power than most. \"Students have more power here. It's great to help create the best learning environment for every student.\" Shail Kalyan, a year 11 student, agrees: \"I've interviewed teachers and it's good to have a say on who will be teaching you.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
