Bee Wilson won the investigative food work award for her Guardian long read \u2018Yes, bacon really is killing us\u2019. Grace Dent was honoured with the food writer award for her writing in the Guardian and The Observer including \u2018The processed food debate is delicious, MSG-sprinkled class war\u2019 and \u2018My life as an (almost) vegan restaurant critic\u2019. Judges commented: On Grace Dent: \u201cDent\u2019s writing uses humour to disarm the reader before hitting you with insightful and sometimes harsh facts. She has the rare ability to act like the class clown while getting right to the heart of the matter. Her piece on processed foods was ironic and funny, but at the same time politically supercharged\u201d. On Bee Wilson: \u201cYes, Bacon Really is Killing Us: An excellently written article about a staple that so many of us enjoy and has always been so central to the British food scene, but which is now embroiled in controversy. Judges found the level of research impressive, the science clearly explained, and Wilson\u2019s argument persuasive and, above all, readable. One judge described this as a \u2018must-read\u2019\u201d. The Guild of Food Writers is a professional association for food writers. The annual awards recognise exceptional achievements in food writing and broadcasting."}, "isHosted": false}}}
