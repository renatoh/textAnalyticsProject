Anyone still doubting that Dean Richards's side are the emerging force in English rugby should have been at Bath on Saturday to see Harlequins follow up their 10-try mid-week victory over Worcester with a brick-wall defensive performance that restricted one of the more attacking sides in the Guinness Premiership to a solitary penalty. Next Saturday Harlequins, who have done nothing in Europe for more than a decade, have a very winnable home Heineken Cup quarter-final against Leinster and, with only two league games left \u2013 even though there is a difficult trip to Sale before the home encounter with in-form Newcastle \u2013 a place in the play-offs seems assured. There is a confidence and unity within the team that on Saturday played most of the game in their own territory and without the ball, but rarely looked second best. They have even moved on from those two benchmark Heineken Cup victories over Stade Francais and as Richards remarked, his players \"have really grown in stature over the last year\" and were now \"soaking up\" their success. \"They have become far more streetwise now, and there is a confidence in the side.\" For Bath the situation could not be more different. They have slipped to the final play-off spot and cannot afford another mistake, face a difficult European quarter-final at Leicester next Saturday and, as their head coach Steve Meehan admitted, a future in cup and league depends how quickly they can shake off the hangover of backs frittering away hard-won overlaps and forwards suffering the indignity of going backwards in the scrum. \"It is a test of character now,\" Meehan. \"We have to put this result to one side and get back to playing the rugby we want to play.\" That presumably means getting David Flatman back into the front row after his day off. On Wednesday with Flatman in place, Bath terrorised the Wasps scrum. On Saturday with the prop taking a well-earned, rotational rest, Bath huffed and puffed even against a seven-man Quins scrum. Facing eight, before Mike Ross was sin-binned, they conceded the only try of the game \u2013 the referee, Dave Pearson, losing patience after five resets and an assortment of skulduggery under the posts. The Bath old boy Chris Malone chipped in with 11 points \u2013 and a mighty defensive game \u2013 missing just one kick while Butch James had another wretched day, landing one from four. Add a calmly taken drop-goal from Danny Care and that was it. Harlequins rarely ventured into Bath territory, but when they did, they come away with points while the home side either fumbled chances, ignored overlaps or just handed the ball to their prolific wing, Joe Maddock, and hoped for the best. Before this match Bath were averaging slightly under three tries a game. \"We had situations out there that we would normally just nail,\" Meecham noted. \"We had opportunities, but we missed them.\" Spot on, but not completely accurate. Harlequins hooker Gary Botha probably came closer with his pithy post-match analysis: \"Attack win matches, defence wins championships.\" Bath Abendanon; Maddock, Crockett (capt; Berne 67), Hape, Banahan (Higgins 67); James, Bemand; Barnes, Mears (Hawkins 75), Bell (Jarvis 46, Bell 73), Harrison, Hooper (Short 56), Beattie, Scaysbrook, Faamatuainu (Goodman 55).
