Brad is in town to make a movie about a war between zombies and humans and Glasgow was chosen because the architecture of its city centre seems closely to resemble that of downtown Philadelphia. We have been told this before when others of Tinseltown's nomenclature have fleetingly visited. On this occasion, though, almost the entire area around George Square, the heart of Glasgow, has been blocked off and will remain so for a while yet. The Pitts seem like a decent couple and, in an enchanting dose of normality, have been accompanied on their trip by their six children. Of Brad's motion picture CV, two works immediately spring to my mind: Interview With the Vampire and Meet Joe Black. He seems to be good at what he does yet he has always struck me as the American version of Hugh Grant in that he brings to his characters the same few attributes he has brought to all his others. I am, though, no expert on the Hollywood oeuvre and it is an honour to have him and his missus visit us at this time: lang may his lum reek and may the road rise to meet him etc. Municipal panjandrums and hoi polloi alike, the fervour with which the city has greeted this gilded couple has in itself been something to behold. The Labour leader of the city council talked of his delight at the visit and added that \"up to \u00a32m would be injected into the local economy\". I sincerely hope, though, that a sum amounting to many times that amount will have been transferred to the council exchequer in exchange for renting out the city for a fortnight or so. At Edinburgh and Highland summer rates, that would amount to at least \u00a310m (the frosty reception and early dining deadlines are free). Scotland's major media outlets have also joined the frenzy and barely a day has elapsed where photos of New York street signs and Brad Pitt lookalikes (there are five) have been used to justify double-page spreads. Normally, our press would deploy a more taciturn approach with a bit of beady-eyed cynicism thrown in to puncture all the ardour. Neither the Queen, Nelson Mandela or yon Dalai Lama would have been greeted with such rapture. This, after all, is a city which has copyrighted the art of studied indifference to celebrity. It is a noble and proud tradition and ought not, for one minute, to be mistaken for rudeness or in any way be indicative of a scrofulous upbringing. It is perhaps best illustrated by a delightful vignette in 1983 when the film director Bill Forsyth took Burt Lancaster to a pub on Glasgow's South Side during a break in the filming of Local Hero (stop me if you've heard this before). As the duo stood at the bar waiting to be served an elderly regular politely asked Forsyth if he fancied a drink, before adding: \"And ask your big pal if he fancies one too.\" In this way, the presence of the Hollywood legend was duly and properly noted and hospitality proffered in a prudent and temperate manner. I like to think that such an approach is rooted in our Presbyterian and socialist egalitarianism. I'm confident that when Brad Pitt's zombie blockbuster is released it will prove to be a classic of its kind. And that the decision to film in Glasgow will be rewarded with healthy box-office returns. I am sure too that the irony of shooting a zombie movie in Glasgow at a time when we are all still reeling from the violent civil disorder throughout England will, sadly, be lost on the director and producers. For if a zombie-themed film were to be written, produced and entirely filmed in and around the west of Scotland, we could imbue it with all sorts of political and sociological undercurrents and presentiments. Jack McLean, still the best newspaper columnist Scotland has ever had, once penned an apocalyptic piece for the old Glasgow Herald. In this, he stated his dear wish one day for the poor, the needy, the neglected and the deprived living in Glasgow's outlying benighted neighbourhoods to rise together as one and march on the city centre. It wasn't an inducement to violent engagement but merely a clarion call for a show of strength by the dispossessed who had been neglected by the political classes. In my zombie film, which would be set in a post-apocalyptic and dystopian urban wasteland (as all the best ones are), martial law has been imposed for years by an intolerant and militaristic government. It is a one-party state because the old Labour party has become part of this coalition representing the interests of bankers and overseas oligarchs. Using the 2011 English riots as justification, the conservative junta introduced a brutal and oppressive regime where the BBC has become a quisling tool of the state by commandeering every CCTV camera in the UK. The dawn raid has become the favoured tactic of the new single national police force and thousands have been executed and transported after one-sided proceedings in rudimentary courts. Those who dared to ask questions such as: \"Why have no bankers and fund managers ever been found guilty of dishonesty and incitement to riot?\" or: \"Who kidnapped the Indian test cricket team?\" were deemed to be anti-social degenerates and burned in an appropriate manner. But one night, the fields shook and the graveyards rocked and the corpses of the poor and the heavy-burdened climbed from their shallow graves and scurried forth. \"Inhuman\" they were called in life and inhuman they remain. The songs of Vanda, Scott and Young would provide the score and the film title would be Zombie Redemption (where the undead are the good guys)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
