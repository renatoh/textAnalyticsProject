He's in the process of weighing up what he needs to do. \"I've offered Joey an olive branch \u2013 to me his crime wasn't that great \u2013 but my dressing room has to be united, we have to fight as one. I think Joey's in a better frame of mind. I think he's beginning to get his head around that it's a difficult decision for him.\" While Barton remains in limbo, Pardew was delighted to have helped his board and players finally resolve a long-running dispute over bonuses. \"I think it's very, very important that we all try and build a new understanding,\" he said. \"It's important that the club and players have agreed there's something in place to reward you for what you do. \"I made it [brokering a deal] a big priority. It's important the board and the players are together. At any football club that's what you need. There has to be a mutual respect. Of course, as the manager it's difficult sometimes because you're in the middle. I'm employed by Mike Ashley and Derek Llambias, but my loyalties are just as strong to the players, who I represent and care about and want to try and enhance their careers and make them better players.\" Jos\u00e9 Enrique's departure for Liverpool on Thursday is expected to lead to Newcastle making a \u00a37m move for PSV Eindhoven's Dutch international left-back Erik Pieters. Pardew is also seeking an extra striker and is understood to be considering making a bid for Arsenal's Nicklas Bendtner. Should Barton depart, he will also urge Ashley and Llambias to release the funds necessary to sign a new midfielder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
