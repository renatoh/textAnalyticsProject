We were all aghast at Shane Warne's sudden departure from South Africa, but it was almost as surprising to see Saqlain Mushtaq and Daniel Vettori sitting on the sidelines when Pakistan and New Zealand played their first games. These were incomprehensible errors in selection by both countries, which contributed to defeats. Never underestimate the value of a top-class spinner in one-day cricket - whatever the prevailing conditions. Australia, when they had the option, would always play Warne even if the wicket was emerald green. On a lively track at the Wanderers against Pakistan they would have played both Warne and Hogg if that had been possible. The quality spinner allows his captain vital flexibility. If the pacemen are getting bashed in the first 15 overs the spinner can be summoned to take the pace off the ball and pose different problems. If the pacemen have made early inroads he can capitalise against wary batsmen, intent on keeping their wicket intact. How Waqar Younis would have liked to toss the ball to Saqlain when Australia were four wickets down at the Wanderers. He could have continued to attack and the batsmen, ever-conscious of Saqlain's wrong'un, would have been tentative. Instead the Aussies had the luxury of the part-time spin of Shahid Afridi and Younis Khan. Likewise Vettori might have been the perfect foil for Shane Bond when the Kiwis played Sri Lanka. When a batsman has adrenaline flooding through his veins after an over of extreme pace he is more likely to make mistakes at the other end against slow, well-directed spin. The New Zealanders were quick to recognise their mistake and Vettori was effective enough in their second game against West Indies. And Pakistan will surely pencil in Saqlain before anyone else when they announce their team for their game against Namibia today. The absence of Warne will switch the spotlight on Brad Hogg, an old West Aussie team-mate of mine. He's a typical farmer from the south of Perth, who first came to our notice at the Waca a decade ago. Then he was predominantly a batsman, who usually bowled left-arm seamers. We soon told him he was unlikely to get a chance with the ball with those such as Bruce Reid and Brendon Julian in the side; so we encouraged him to develop his wrist spinners. Within three years he was whisked off to India and a maiden Test match but he was far too green; technically and mentally he was not ready. But now he is. I think he could be one of the leading wicket-takers in the World Cup. He never shirks hard work; he's hyperactive in the field; we always likened him to a sheep dog, always on the move, and he is used to batting down the order in the closing overs of the innings. I expect him to do well but there will be a time in this competition when Ricky Ponting will be pining for Warne. It will be in a knock-out game with the match in the balance. Warne threatens before he bowls a ball just as Viv Richards did before he received one. One other notable absentee - in South Africa's second game - was Allan Donald. His old team-mate, Fanie de Villiers, has even said that Donald should not be in their squad. De Villiers' view mystifies me. The South Africans must recognise that Donald is not the bowler he used to be, but with his vast experience he can still be a key player, coming on first change. I would have him in my side when the South Africans take on New Zealand today. Even though New Zealand have an appalling recent record against South Africa, it is the home side that will feel the pressure. Donald may be feeling beleaguered, while South Africa's victory against Kenya does not atone for the defeat at the hands of the West Indies in the opening game. And the burden of expectation remains. New Zealand, on the other hand, will have gained confidence from a tough win against the West Indies - and they have Vettori back in the side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
