At the weekend a peak audience of 6.9 million watched England\u2019s match against Cameroon, and there is every expectation that figure will be surpassed on Thursday night when Phil Neville\u2019s side face Norway. With France, Brazil and Italy also enjoying record-breaking TV figures in recent days there is growing sense that women\u2019s football, which has often been marginalised and sneered at, has finally gone mainstream. The BBC has told the Guardian that three of England\u2019s matches at the Women\u2019s World Cup rank in its top 10 most-watched football games of 2019 \u2013 something that would have been unthinkable barely a decade ago - with only Manchester United\u2019s FA Cup ties against Chelsea and Arsenal, and the final between Manchester City and Watford, attracting higher peak audiences. Even Glastonbury has got in on the act, responding to a plea from England\u2019s 20-year-old midfielder Georgia Stanway to show the Norway game so that her brother can watch it while at the festival. No wonder that when a Norwegian reporter asked Karen Bardsley whether England was in the midst of a \u201crevolution in women\u2019s football\u201d, the goalkeeper nodded in agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice way to put it,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWe have gone from struggling to get teams in competitions to having massive clubs involved and being full-time professionals.\u201d Neville also admits he was caught by surprise by the sudden surge in popularity. \u201cWhen I took the manager\u2019s job 18 months ago I never envisaged we\u2019d be where we are today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exploded, really. The World Cup has helped. But you don\u2019t have an explosion without the quality on the field.\u201d That big bang is being felt globally, too. According to Fifa, France\u2019s match against Brazil at the weekend got the biggest TV audience for a Women\u2019s World Cup match with 35 million watching in Brazil and another 10.6 million in France. There was a similarly uplifting story in the Netherlands, where the victory against Japan on Tuesday was watched by 3.54 million \u2013 the fourth-highest TV rating for any sporting event in the country during 2019. Italy\u2019s manager, Milena Bertolini, has noted the effect that the team\u2019s progress into the quarter-finals has had on attitudes back home. \u201cI know cultural changes take a lot of time, but this team are able to break down some of those prejudices,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s their mission.\u201d Lynsey Douglas, the women\u2019s sport global lead at Nielsen, which tracks TV audiences, told the Guardian that the boom in viewers in the UK and elsewhere are indicative of a wider trend. \u201cThe audiences for this Women\u2019s World Cup have been breaking records all around the world, with plenty of free to air coverage attracting audiences in the millions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd while there are still eight games remaining, we fully expect this to be the most watched women\u2019s tournament in history.\u201d England go into their quarter-final as warm favourites, given they are ranked third in the world while Norway are outside the top 10. Neville, although his team have not yet completely convinced, is confident they will handle the greater expectations back home. \u201cIn the past, you\u2019d probably shield the players from a fear of failure \u2013 but my girls don\u2019t have that,\u201d he said. \u201cThree or four years ago we were crying out to get to these levels of attention and visibility. When we get here we\u2019re not going to back off and say it\u2019s a bit nerve-wracking.\u201d Bardsley, who has been part of the national side since 2005, is convinced that this is by far the strongest England team she has played for. \u201cWe\u2019re in a fantastic place,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had more belief. We are the most prepared team, the most resilient team. We know our strengths inside and out. And we have gained and gathered momentum. I\u2019m very excited because we haven\u2019t met our full potential yet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
