Aghast, I could only apologise, but I had just experienced something that had until then eluded me in 60 years of climbing Lakeland fells. Now having just ascended Lord's Seat to the topmost point above Whinlatter's sprawling forest, it had been a revelatory experience \u2013 witness this moment of mental aberration. Not \"everybody's cup of tea\" writes Alfred Wainwright in his guide to the ascent, adding the forest is gloomy. No, and not everyone favours jarring forest roads that are more suitable for car rallying either. It was, however, forest glades taking short-cuts between serried ranks of spruce that more than made up for such unforgiving surfaces and gave squishy going over aromatic pine needles. Here is Conan Doyle's Lost World revisited, where dinosaurs might at any moment crash into view through an eternity of tall tree trunks receding into the distance, and with no hint of the heights above. So it is all the more dramatic when, once above the trees, a bare mountain-top arrives after a stiff climb above a mosaic of wiry winter heather. From this eyrie behold skylines stretching afar: like the undulating skyline swooping down and across to Barf, with its whitewashed Bishop's Rock near the A66. Closer to hand, an easier ridge leads to Broom Fell while across the pass to Hobcarton Pike and Grisedale Pike still more fells cluster. Eye-opening stuff indeed when seen from above the cloak of the forest, and the Vale of Keswick appearing and disappearing through the mists with Saddleback beyond. Like some apocalyptic vision, where the osprey is said to soar within close range, here was a new world calling, yet one more of Lakeland's so many hidden facets awaiting discovery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
