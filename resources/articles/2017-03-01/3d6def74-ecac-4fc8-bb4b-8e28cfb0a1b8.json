For many derbies that might be unusual, but in this case it is a familiar situation: this will be the fifth successive game between the two clubs with new managers in each dugout. In the 16 months since the pair last met at the City Ground, the two clubs have changed managers eight times between them. It is as if the two rivals are competing to see which can be the most chaotic club in the east Midlands. The latest man to make himself comfortable \u2013 but perhaps not too comfortable \u2013 in the Forest dugout is Mark Warburton. Until recently Rangers manager, Warburton left Ibrox in slightly curious circumstances last month, after the club claimed he and his assistant David Weir resigned, something they strenuously denied. Given that Warburton is Forest\u2019s third manager of a season that now sees them two points off the relegation zone, is the eighth permanent manager since 2012 and the club are owned by the erratic and unpopular Fawaz al-Hasawi, he is not exactly trading an unstable position for a rock solid one. \u201cYou have to take risks,\u201d said Warburton after becoming the latest man to walk through the City Ground\u2019s revolving door. \u201cYou can\u2019t always play safe, far from it.\u201d It is not every day that a manager arrives admitting that the job he has taken on is a gamble, albeit from his perspective a calculated one. Frank McParland, the man who brought Raheem Sterling to Liverpool and has worked with Warburton at Rangers and Brentford \u2013 \u201cOne of the best in the business,\u201d said Warburton \u2013 arrived at Forest a couple of weeks ago as director of football and has been able to fill the new manager in on the state of things. A canary down the mine, if you will. The trouble is that this particular mine has swallowed up so many who have come before, to the point that one wonders whether the identity of the manager really makes much of a difference. There has been little approaching a consistent plan under Hasawi \u2013 there have been many plans but none of them have lasted particularly long, and Warburton\u2019s mere presence is another indicator of that. Less than a month ago the youth-team coach Gary Brazil was confirmed as first-team manager until the end of the season, with the idea that Warburton would arrive in the summer. Since then results have been variable and not for the first time Hasawi changed his mind. \u201cIt happened very quickly,\u201d said Warburton, who admitted he did not expect to be here so soon. After a takeover by the American businessman John Moores fell through in January, Hasawi has spoken on a number of occasions about implementing a proper structure at the club, sorely needed after four and a half years in which chief executives and directors of football have come and gone, with Forest in an undulating state of chaos as league positions gradually decline. Despite his promises, and with Evangelos Marinakis, the Olympiakos owner and an old friend of Hasawi, apparently back for a second attempt at involvement in the club after last summer\u2019s efforts were derailed by the pesky detail of pending criminal charges, Forest fans would be forgiven for thinking: \u201cWe\u2019ll believe it when we see it.\u201d Still, Warburton has been adequately convinced. \u201cYou have to ask the right questions,\u201d he said, when asked what assurances he has been given. \u201cWe\u2019ve received the right answers.\u201d Warburton is in the slightly sticky position of having an immediate goal of beating Derby and their new manager, Gary Rowett (who if the Moores takeover had gone through could have been on the home bench), then keeping Forest in the Championship, while at the same time laying foundations for more long-term stability. \u201cThis is fairly unusual, to come in with nine games to go,\u201d said Warburton. \u201cYou have to get the balance right. I think you have to introduce one or two key principles that are non-negotiable, to say: \u2018This is what we stand for, this is what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019\u201d Warburton could be a good appointment for Forest and listening to him talk about how he wants his team to play is certainly encouraging. \u201cI want players who enjoy playing football, I want players to enjoy having the ball, I want players to enjoy having possession \u2013 but not for possession\u2019s sake, I want possession with a purpose, to penetrate.\u201d But then again a few of his many predecessors have spoken well, initially optimistic and enthusiastic about working at such a storied club, before reality kicks in. Warburton will have a chance of succeeding only if he is allowed to, is afforded some patience and for the club to just be stable for a while. But first, Derby."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
