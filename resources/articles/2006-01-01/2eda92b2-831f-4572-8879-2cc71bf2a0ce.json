The 48-hour stoppage by members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will hit job centres, benefit offices, pension centres and the Child Support Agency across England, Scotland and Wales following growing revolt over the scale of job losses across the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP). The strike follows cuts of approximately 15,000 jobs in the DWP as it seeks to cull a total of 30,000 jobs by 2008, as part of chancellor Gordon Brown's drive to cut waste and improve efficiency across government. But frontline staff claim the scale of cuts has seen services to the most vulnerable members of the public deteriorate as overstretched staff struggle to deliver. The union's 90,000 members in the DWP balloted for strike action ahead of a last-ditch attempt made last week to persuade the government to review the scale of the cuts. Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS, said the strike would go ahead next Thursday and Friday after talks with the government broke down. Mr Serwotka attacked the government for failing to pay heed to the union's request to stall any further job cuts until an objective joint assessment was carried out to verify union claims that services were being hampered as too few staff were now in place to deliver. He also condemned the DWP for failing to rule out compulsory redundancies. Mr Serwotka said the decision to go ahead with the strike had been a difficult decision. \"Strike action is not a step we take lightly\", he said. \"But against a backdrop of the DWP refusing to acknowledge the damage being wrought by job cuts, our members will take action to defend the services they deliver. \"Unless the department wake up and halt the job cuts programme and look objectively at staffing levels there is a real danger that some of the most disadvantaged in society will be let down and no longer get the hand up they need.\" The DWP today described the union's decision to plough on with strike action as \"disappointing\". In a statement issued this afternoon, the DWP said: \"We have said throughout that we want to work with them through discussion, not industrial action. If we are going to meet our commitment to deliver the highest quality of service to our customers it is vital we push ahead with our modernisation programme. \"It is therefore disappointing that the PCS appear to not be moving in the same direction and seem opposed to much of the change. \"We are absolutely committed to our service to the public. Our robust contingency plans will ensure that our top priority - to make payment to our customers - is maintained.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
