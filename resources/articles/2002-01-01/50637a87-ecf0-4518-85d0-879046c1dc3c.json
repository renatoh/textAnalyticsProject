Assistant coach Angelo Gregucci and youth team coach Luciano Chiarugi took charge of today's training session as the troubled club prepare for Sunday's trip to high-flying Chievo. Mancini, in his first coaching position since ending his playing career, had been frustrated at Fiorentina's failure to bring in new signings to strengthen his squad and walked out after late-night talks with owner Vittorio Cecchi Gori. Gori, who had failed in his attempt to sign defender Sinisa Mihajlovic on loan from Lazio, had hoped to assure Mancini that that Internazionale strikers Anselmo Robbiati and Adriano would still be joining the club. Mancini took over as coach of the Florence club in March after previously working as assistant to current England coach Sven Goran Eriksson at Lazio. The former Sampdoria and Lazio striker, who made 36 appearances for Italy, played briefly for Leicester City last season before returning to Italy to take over from Fatih Terim in Florence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
