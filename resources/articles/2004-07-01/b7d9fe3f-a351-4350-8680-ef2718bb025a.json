The best medium-term savings rates are not much more than 4%, so in five working days we could have lost roughly the amount we could earn in a year leaving cash on deposit. Suffer many more weeks like that and bumper weeks are required just to get back to even. Man Group, though, doesn't think that way. Yesterday it announced the weekly performance figure of its AHL Diversified, its core hedge fund - a fall of 4.03%. This, it maintains, is within normal parameters for a fund which has generated an average 12.2% a year since its launch in 1998. The message is: stay cool, AHL has always bounced back with a vengeance. Statistically, we must assume, they are correct. Yet AHL's tumble - it is now down 15% in five months - clearly has Man's investors worried. The group's share price fell 7% yesterday. There are good reasons to be worried. Whatever Man says about the diversity of its earnings, the investment performance of AHL Diversified and the prosperity of the company are tied very closely: it is the reason why Man feels obliged to publish weekly performance numbers. AHL is also the biggest reason why Man has become the world's largest hedge fund company and the sexiest Footsie stock in the past few years. The fund itself accounts for only $370m (\u00a3203) of assets, but other AHL funds, which follow its investment style, account for a further $10bn, a huge number. The investment style is simple: find a trend and follow it. The value, say AHL's fans, lies in the \"black box\" of complex formulas, which identifies the trends. Reversals in performance, they argue, are always to be expected when trends reverse; in this case, the big reversal was the rise in US interest rates a month ago. Maybe AHL will get back to 12% annual returns, just as the black box predicts, but that is not what they are saying in the hedge fund world. Shrewdies there talk of front-running AHL - identifying its target trends and then selling the assets to the fund at an inflated price. AHL, they say, is now too big to be nimble and its black box too formula-driven to know when it is being given the runaround. A lot hinges on which is the correct explanation. AHL's investors are generally Asian millionaires, who can swallow some pain, but our pension funds have also been pouring billions into hedge funds, many of which follow AHL-style computer-driven philosophies. A crisis in this industry would now be a crisis for the market. Common sense suggests something has to give: a few exceptional individuals may be capable of generating 12% returns year after year, but it's a pipedream to believe they are available to everybody. On the one hand ... Charlie Bean offered something for everyone when he spoke to the Institute of Economic Affairs yesterday. The housing market might come down with a bump, but it might come to a gentle standstill. There was an argument in favour of a more aggressive monetary policy, but - hang on a minute, he said - there was also a case for taking it step by step. Even so, the message the City took from the speech was that rates are going up next week, by 0.25 percentage points. The reason for the City's confidence was in a slightly esoteric chunk of Bean's address. Up until now, the Bank has placed the prime emphasis in its quarterly inflation report on what will happen to the cost of living over the next two years based on constant interest rates. As a back-up, the report has also given a view of what will happen to inflation, based on market predictions. In reality, Bean said, looking at unchanged interest rates has been of only limited use to the Bank in recent months as it has been clear that policy needs to be tightened. Constant interest rates, according to the Bank's model, would have led to inflation busting the government's target. As a result, the MPC has been focusing on what the City thinks the likely path of interest rates to be, and next month's inflation report will give primacy to market rates. The markets think rates will need to go up by a quarter-point in August and by a further quarter-point in November, reaching 5% by the year's end and 5.5% by late 2005. Much can happen between now and November, but not much is likely to change in the next week. Unless it does, the Bank will follow the market's lead and raise rates. Poor delivery It is a wonder that ebookers, the online travel group, has so far managed to retain its investment grade status given its pristine record of non-delivery. Yesterday it was only towards the end of its formal trading statement that the company was able to admit that its \"adjusted profit for the year will be significantly below the low end of recent published analyst expectations\". Just to be clear here, \"adjusted profit\" is profit in the thoroughly discredited sense of profit \"before tax after adding back exceptional items, amortisation of goodwill, stock compensation expenses/credits and national insurance relating to share options payable if employees exercise their share option\". That last factor is less of an issue than it was yesterday morning, since the share price is now 30% lower."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
