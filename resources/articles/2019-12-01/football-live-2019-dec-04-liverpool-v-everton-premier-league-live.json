Not such a good one for Marco Silva, who is under serious pressure now with his side in the relegation zone. \u201cIt was a tough night for us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cannot concede goals like we did at this level. We were not good enough.\u201d Andy Hunter was at Anfield to witness a memorable Mersey derby. Here\u2019s his report. Click and enjoy, and thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! As Anfield celebrates, Divock Origi speaks. \u201cIt\u2019s a special game, and as a team we enjoyed it. We showed that we really enjoy to play for Liverpool. The manager showed us trust, and so it was important to get the three points. I think my first goal was important to break the game open, but the second one, technically, I enjoyed that one! We used the space well. We had wonderful service. We have a great team, and we have to be at our best. We try to push each other and enjoy. I\u2019m grateful to be here.\u201d A rollercoaster ride comes to an end. Liverpool remain eight points clear of second-placed Leicester City, while Everton slip into the relegation zone. Marco Silva warmly hugs Jurgen Klopp on the touchline. Is that his last act as manager at Goodison? 90 min +2: Liverpool stroke it around as their fans question Everton\u2019s 2020-21 status in song form. 90 min +1: There will be three added minutes. This match can\u2019t end soon enough for Marco Silva and Everton. Firmino, out on the left, turns Holgate inside out with a cute drop of the shoulder and a shuffle of the feet. He reaches the byline and pulls the ball back for Wijnaldum, who opens his body and sidefoots across Pickford and into the bottom right. 88 min: A high ball falls towards Pickford on the edge of the box. It\u2019s panto season, so Liverpool\u2019s fans holler as it drops. Pickford, perhaps mindful of what happened at the Kop end last year, does extremely well to claim under pressure. 87 min: Anfield is racked with collective tension. A goal for Everton now would really put the cat among the pigeons. Richarlison competes for a high ball in the Liverpool box, but is penalised for an overly aggressive nudge on Van Dijk. 85 min: Nothing comes of the set piece. Liverpool go up the other end, Shaqiri releasing Mane. He rounds Pickford, but just as he\u2019s preparing to roll home, he\u2019s nudged in the back by Holgate, who nicks the ball away. What a chance spurned! Should it have been a penalty? It would have been a harsh decision. And then, immediately afterwards, Kean is sent clear down the middle! He must score, but slams his shot wide left from the edge of the box. It could have been 5-2, it could have been 4-3. This has been a very odd game. 84 min: Henderson clanks into Sigurdsson and that\u2019s a free kick 40 yards out. Before it\u2019s taken, Joe Gomez comes on for Trent Alexander-Arnold. Everton load the box and Wijnaldum slices out for a corner. 83 min: This is better, though. Digne bursts into space down the left and stands one up to the far post. There\u2019s nobody in blue taking a chance, and Robertson can clear easily. 82 min: Everton stroke it around the back for a bit, a state of affairs Liverpool are quite happy with. They\u2019re going nowhere. 80 min: Mane should have wrapped this match up, with a pretty bow. Henderson plays long for Mane, who takes the ball down on the edge of the D. Wijnaldum gets in his way a little, but even so, Mane should tuck the ball away. Instead he shoots inches wide of the bottom right. Will Liverpool live to regret that miss? There\u2019s still time for Everton to get back into the game. A goal for the visitors and Anfield will get extremely nervous. 79 min: Digne throws in from the left. Lovren goes up with Kean, who goes over, but it\u2019s not a penalty. Everton keep pressing, though, Richarlison winning a corner out on the right. The set piece is a bit of a non-event. 78 min: Shaqiri whips it in. Wijnaldum heads harmlessly into the Kop while looking for the top left. 77 min: A couple of nice flicks by Shaqiri, then Mane bursts down the left. He\u2019s blocked unfairly by Schneiderlin, and this is a free kick out on the wing, a chance to load the box. 75 min: The match has started to drift. To be fair, the punters have already got good bang for their buck. \u201cLiving in deep, dark West Wales, my internet connection is exactly as good as you imagine it to be,\u201d writes Amazon Prime customer Matt Dony. \u201cIt\u2019s been nice to see what it would have been like to watch a live match through a ZX Spectrum.\u201d 73 min: Everton make their last change, replacing Tom Davies with Morgan Schneiderlin. Liverpool respond with a double swap of their own, sending on Jordan Henderson and Roberto Firmino in place of Adam Lallana and Divock Origi, the latter getting a particularly warm ovation for his evening\u2019s work. 71 min: Robertson fizzes a very inviting pass through the Everton box from the left. There\u2019s nobody there to tap in. Had someone in red taken a gamble, Liverpool would have restored their three-goal lead. 69 min: Shaqiri loops a pass down the inside left and nearly releases Mane, who is forced to check under pressure from Keane. Mane waits for the ball to drop so he can have a bash at goal from the edge of the box ... but it never does, not in an inviting way, anyway. Keane eases him out of the road. 67 min: Davies slides in late on Alexander-Arnold, and is booked for his trouble. 65 min: Davies has a lash from distance. Adrian is behind it all the way. 63 min: All very scrappy, all of a sudden. Alexander-Arnold sticks out an arm in the middle of a melee. A deliberate handball? Not according to the referee. He\u2019d have been walking if the decision went the other way. 61 min: Moise Kean comes on for Dominic Calvert-Lewin. His very first act is to win a corner down the right. Sigurdsson takes, and Richarlison slaps a header straight at Adrian. A great chance. Either side of the keeper, and Everton would be right back in this. 59 min: Alexander-Arnold goes tearing down the right. His cross is headed out weakly by Keane. Milner chests down and thinks about shooting. Instead he slips a ball down the right channel for Lallana, who spins, shoots over, and was offside anyway. 57 min: Mane is bowled over in midfield by Keane and Davies. Keane is fairly fortunate not to see yellow for blootering the ball away in frustration. The resulting free kick, by Alexander-Arnold, sails harmlessly into the Kop. 56 min: Origi makes good down the right and finds himself hauled down by Mina. A free kick just to the side of the box, near the byline. Shaqiri whips it in, but the referee blows up for an Everton free kick, the result of some pushing and shoving. 55 min: Another corner for Liverpool out on the right. Alexander-Arnold takes this one, and it\u2019s easily dealt with by the Everton defence. A fair chance the goal tally in this game won\u2019t end at six. 54 min: One corner leads to another. Shaqiri\u2019s second effort is flicked across the face of goal, but Holgate is on point at the far post to clear with Origi and Wijnaldum lurking. 53 min: Origi spins just inside the Everton box and shoots. It\u2019s blocked instantly. The ball breaks to Milner who has another crack. This one\u2019s deflected out to the right of goal for a corner. Shaqiri will take it, and send the ball into a crowded six-yard box. 52 min: Digne takes a good but not great free kick. It\u2019s aimed towards the top right, but always a little high and wide. An interesting stat here: Everton have had nine attempts to Liverpool\u2019s five. 51 min: Robertson\u2019s poor clearing header causes Van Dijk to uncharacteristically panic, needlessly knocking Calvert-Lewin to the ground under a high ball. A free kick just to the right of the D. A dangerous position. If Everton score the next goal, this really is game on. 49 min: Iwobi and Sigurdsson combine well down the right. The ball\u2019s hooked in for Richarlison, who can\u2019t connect properly, and sends a header sailing harmlessly into the arms of Adrian. Anfield still nervous, bordering on silent. 47 min: Anfield is a fairly pensive place at the moment. You wouldn\u2019t know we were in the middle of a six-goal thriller. Or maybe that\u2019s exactly why everyone\u2019s so tense. Van Dijk doesn\u2019t help matters by spraying a simple pass out of play on the left. Deep breath, then, because here we go again! Everton get the ball rolling again. Liverpool are kicking towards the Kop. Half-time entertainment. Like you weren\u2019t already excited enough. Marco Silva goes off down the tunnel in a fury, waving his arms this way and that. Jurgen Klopp isn\u2019t too happy either. On the balance of play, his side should be home and hosed already ... but this isn\u2019t over by a long chalk. Not if those wild and wonderful 48 minutes were anything to go by! This is absurd! Bernard is fed down the left. He crosses towards Richarlison, who sends a diving header into the bottom right! Actually on second glance, it\u2019s come off his shoulder, not that he cares too much. Everton are still in this! Just about. 45 min +1: There will be three added minutes. Everton are desperate to hear the half-time whistle. The small margins, though. Had Lovren not slid in to feather that cross away from Calvert-Lewin, it\u2019d be 3-2 and game on. As it is, Everton are in all sorts of bother now. Van Dijk heads the resulting corner clear. Mane scampers up the left, and sends Alexander-Arnold away down the wing. Liverpool are two on one, with Shaqiri free on the right. Alexander-Arnold bides his time, and eventually slips the ball right, not to Shaqiri, but to Mane, who had kept running. It\u2019s a perfectly weighted pass, begging to be hit, and Mane sidefoots it into the bottom left from the edge of the box. 44 min: Richarlison bustles into the Liverpool box on the right, and whips a lovely ball across the face of goal. Calvert-Lewin is waiting to run the ball home, but Lovren sticks out a leg to divert the ball away for a corner. A goal-saving intervention. 43 min: Van Dijk looks long for Mane down the right, but there\u2019s way too much juice on the ball, and it sails through to Pickford. Everton go up the other end, Bernard nearly sending Davies into the box with a cute flick down the left, but Alexander-Arnold toes the ball away just in time. 41 min: Calvert-Lewin chases a lost cause down the right. Robertson clumsily barges him in the back, and this is a free kick just outside the box, right on the byline. A very dangerous position. Sigurdsson takes, and finds the head of Keane, six yards out, but the defender can\u2019t guide home this time. 40 min: Richarlison spins down the inside-left channel and slips a pass inside for Iwobi, who has a chance to shoot from the edge of the D. Iwobi hooks a strange effort wide left and high. Adrian had nothing to do. 38 min: Wijnaldum juggles the ball down the right, setting Shaqiri off into space. Shaqiri plays Mane in on the overlap. Mane crosses low, forcing Pickford to parry away from goal and into the heart of the area. Fortunately the ball falls to a blue shirt and Everton can clear their lines. But that was risky. 36 min: Everton\u2019s heads have momentarily gone. They are all over the shop at the back. Milner floats a ball in from the left for Shaqiri, who is outjumped by Keane. Corner ... from which nothing happens. 35 min: Everton make a tactical change. Djibril Sidibe is hooked, with Bernard coming on. Everton will play four at the back, with Mason Holgate taking the departed Sidibe\u2019s slot out on the right. 33 min: Keane clatters into Mane in the midfield. No yellow. This one came out of nowhere. Lovren pings a long pass down the middle. Origi takes it out of the sky with his right peg, then opens his body to sidefoot a lob past Pickford and into the net! Shades of Luis Suarez versus Newcastle. What a touch to kill that long ball! 30 min: It\u2019s getting a bit dirty. Richarlison is late on Shaqiri, studding his left ankle. He sees yellow. Like Alexander-Arnold before him, it could easily have been a red. 29 min: Now Liverpool want a penalty, as Mane tumbles while chasing a pass down the inside-left channel. They\u2019re not getting one. He clattered into Sidibe, but the defender took the ball cleanly, face on. 27 min: Alexander-Arnold is booked, quite correctly, for a late stamp on Digne\u2019s foot. Another referee might have brandished red. Liverpool\u2019s young full-back needs to calm down quickly, or he\u2019ll be the latest in a long line of players to take an early bath in this fixture. 26 min: No penalty. Probably the correct decision, there didn\u2019t seem much contact from behind. Either way, VAR isn\u2019t interested. 25 min: Liverpool play a high line. Iwobi busts it open with a pass down the right, releasing Calvert-Lewin on goal! The air is sucked out of Anfield. An equaliser looks on the cards ... until Calvert-Lewin falls just inside the box, Van Dijk pressurising him from behind. The ball squirts wide right of goal. Everton want a penalty. And there\u2019s going to be a VAR check. 23 min: Richarlison isn\u2019t particularly happy as Alexander-Arnold lands on his leg, studs first. It looked like an accident, though Richarlison clearly doesn\u2019t think it was. The referee gets in between the pair and calms everything down. 22 min: That was very scrappy from Liverpool\u2019s point of view. On the touchline, Jurgen Klopp looks furious. As he fumes, Lallana is stripped of possession while faffing about. Iwobi can\u2019t quite feed Richarlison down the inside-right channel. Had he got the pass right, he\u2019d have freed his team-mate into the box. Anfield is suddenly a very tense place. Everton work a short corner back up the right flank. Iwobi suddenly cruises into the area down the channel and feeds Keane, who breaks through a poor Lovren challenge and lifts the ball over Adrian and into the net. Game back on! 20 min: A free kick for Everton out on the left. Digne\u2019s delivery is no good, but Robertson slashes at a clearance wildly, and shanks the ball out for a corner on the right. From which ... 19 min: Klopp\u2019s team selection, eh. Everton try to bounce back quickly, winning a corner out on the left. Mina heads it well over the bar. Another stunner! Alexander-Arnold, deep on the right, sprays a widescreen pass to Mane out on the left. Mane drifts infield and slips a ball down the inside-left channel. Shaqiri, barrelling in, sticks out a leg and delicately guides the ball past the outrushing Pickford and into the empty net. What a goal that was. 16 min: Robertson clips Davies from behind, then falls on his back. Davies isn\u2019t happy at all, and springs up with a view to throwing hands. Robertson smiles malevolently, not wholly unlike the bit in Trainspotting where Renton gets whacked by a car and then grins at the driver through the windscreen. 14 min: Lallana has a dig from 25 yards. His shot is wide left, and he\u2019d used his arm while chesting the ball down anyway. Free kick. 13 min: Everton are asking a couple of questions, though. Another game of bagatelle in the Liverpool box ends with Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin kind of getting in each other\u2019s way, when a shot from 12 yards looked on. Eventually the ball\u2019s shanked wide right. They too should have done much better. This is a nice, open, free-flowing match. 11 min: Mane is sent clear down the inside left by another raking Van Dijk pass. He should at least get a shot on target, but checks back and shifts inside in order to get a better angle. He allows Mina to get back to block. Should have done much better. 10 min: Iwobi strips Robertson of possession and drives down the inside-right channel. It\u2019s a promising attack, but Milner comes from behind and a superb textbook sliding tackle stops Iwobi in his tracks. 9 min: Lallana spins up and down the left touchline, nearly getting the better of Sidibe ... but not quite. Liverpool are looking sprightly, energised by that early boost. 8 min: Keane flings a ball into the Liverpool area from the left. Adrian claims, then gets into a spat with Calvert-Lewin. Two grown men, and all. Van Dijk breaks it up with a smile. Last season\u2019s hero is at it again! There\u2019s a little bit of pinball in the Liverpool box, started by Richarlison. Robertson clears. Mane picks up possession out on the left, then plays one of the passes of the season, curling a perfectly weighted one to the feet of Origi, who doesn\u2019t have to break stride to collect the ball and round Pickford in one smooth movement, before rolling into the net. That was a delight. 5 min: Iwobi sends Calvert-Lewin scampering down the right wing, but the striker looked offside and the whistle goes anyway. Turns out Iwobi handled while chesting down. 4 min: A scrappy passage of play in the middle of the park. Everton will be happy enough, especially as its quietened the home faithful a tad. 2 min: Mane and Mina clashed heads when the Liverpool man headed over. Trainers on to look at them both. They\u2019re good to go again. The Amazon picture shifts out of focus, art imitating real life. 1 min: Origi has an early dribble into the Everton box, but it\u2019s a dead end. Everton clear. Liverpool come straight back at them, Robertson tearing down the left after a long Van Dijk pass. He crosses for Mane, who heads over from 12 yards. And we\u2019re off! Liverpool get the ball rolling, defending the Kop end in the first half, which is how they like it. Here come the teams! Some breaking news, and a Guardian world exclusive: Liverpool will play in red while Everton sport blue. Here\u2019s another thing you don\u2019t need me to tell you: there\u2019s a cracking atmosphere in Anfield ahead of the Merseyside derby. You Never Walk Alone gets a belt out, while the Everton end sing in defiance. And finally all four corners of the ground give a round of applause for the continued bravery of the Hillsborough families. Justice for the 96. We\u2019ll be off in a minute or two. Marco Silva talks! \u201cIt is a tough match. It is a special game for both teams and for the city. We should forget their position in the table and the record in the last 20 years; it is an opportunity. Just because they have changed players, they have not changed their DNA and will be a strong team for sure. I see a really strong side to play against. It is important we keep the good things we did against Leicester. Some of the other things we should improve, the way we managed the game. It is a challenge. I would like to see the same Everton I saw here last season.\u201d Some pre-match jitters in the LFC fanbase. \u201cThe film critic Pauline Kael said that Brian de Palma films were so tense you wanted someone to hurry up and get killed so you could have a breather,\u201d writes Ian Copestake. \u201cI find myself almost feeling the same about the agonies one goes through watching Liverpool remain unbeaten. But please, not now! Not to them!\u201d Anthony O Connell adds: \u201cThat team Klopp has picked tonight is worrying. Very, very worrying. Lallana in central mid, too light. Origi a great sub, not a great starter.\u201d \u201cGreat to see Shaq getting a start,\u201d begins Alyson Douglas. \u201cNot so much confidence in Lallana.\u201d And finally here\u2019s Alex Davies: \u201cPerhaps you can reassure me - it may just be my inner pessimist - but I can\u2019t shake the feeling, looking at this lineup, that Klopp has gone utterly mad.\u201d It\u2019s almost as though everyone can suddenly feel Pep\u2019s breath on the back of their neck, in the wake of Manchester City\u2019s 4-1 win at Burnley last night. A title race, right here. Jurgen Klopp talks to Amazon Prime. \u201cOne change I had to make, the other four we wanted to. We did it because we can do it. I have said a lot of times we have the squad. It will be intense. It\u2019s a very important game for both sides, but you try to fight as hard as you can for the three points. It\u2019s all clear, it\u2019s a very difficult game, I don\u2019t care about the stats and history. It is nothing we think about.\u201d He also praises Everton, their fans and representatives for their support over Hillsborough during recent trying times. \u201cThe people in the city stand together, we are 100 percent united.\u201d Don\u2019t forget, there are five other Premier League games taking place tonight. They\u2019ve already kicked off. Simon Burnton has your back. Adrian talks to Amazon Prime. \u201cIt is my first derby with Liverpool. I hope we have a great night. I am really happy to be back, it is an opportunity for me, and I\u2019ll try to give my best. We need some fresh legs as we have many games in front of us, a heavy schedule. We have quality enough to play any game with any kind of player, we have a big squad.\u201d Alex Iwobi\u2019s making his first appearance in a Merseyside derby too, and he\u2019s also been chatting to the new broadcaster on the scene. \u201cI\u2019m excited. I\u2019m no stranger to a derby as I\u2019m used to one in north London. We did very well at Leicester, there\u2019s a lot of positives to take and bring into this game. The pressure\u2019s on all of us, but that\u2019s why we are professionals and we\u2019ll do our best. We\u2019re not afraid, we go out there to battle and do our best. If we get a result it\u2019ll turn our season around.\u201d Liverpool make five changes to the XI sent out against Brighton last Saturday. James Milner and Adam Lallana replace Jordan Henderson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in midfield. Adrian deputises for the suspended Alisson in goal. And up front, a couple of big and perhaps surprising calls, as Xherdan Shaqiri and Divock Origi allow Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah to put their feet up on the bench. It\u2019s the Powercube\u2019s first start in the Premier League since January. Everton name the same XI so unlucky to lose at Leicester. Another 5-4-1 it is, then. Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson, Wijnaldum, Lallana, Milner, Shaqiri, Mane, Origi. Subs: Keita, Firmino, Salah, Gomez, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kelleher. Everton: Pickford, Sidibe, Holgate, Mina, Keane, Digne, Iwobi, Davies, Sigurdsson, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Baines, Walcott, Tosun, Schneiderlin, Bernard, Kean, Lossl. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral). Two banners. Posted without comment. Everton haven\u2019t had much luck in the Merseyside derby of late. It\u2019s been 19 matches since they won one of them, when Tim Cahill and Mikel Arteta saw off Mr Roy\u2019s Reds in 2010. And it\u2019s been 20 years since they won at Anfield, their last triumph in their old home courtesy of a Kevin Campbell goal. God speed, Toffees. Liverpool are currently eight points clear at the top of the Premier League, while Everton hover just a couple above the relegation zone. So it\u2019s not just the history books that Marco Silva\u2019s side are up against; the current form book suggests only one likely result, too. But a quick flick through our third tome - the great big book of hoary old cliches - will tell you that form goes out of the window in a derby. So ... ... there is hope! For starters, Everton usually give Liverpool a proper game. They were the better team at Anfield last season, only to be undone by Jordan Pickford\u2019s surreal late error, while they were awkward and cussed in a goalless draw at Goodison that handed title advantage to Manchester City. It\u2019s been a while since Liverpool have had it easy against their neighbours. And while Everton have injury problems of their own - no Jean-Philippe Gbamin, Andre Gomes, Fabian Delph or Seamus Coleman - Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side is depleted in a couple of important positions. They\u2019ll miss Fabinho\u2019s midfield glue until the New Year, while keeper Alisson is suspended after his reckless red card against Brighton. So can Everton spring a surprise that may save Marco Silva\u2019s job? Or will Liverpool keep onwards and upwards in their relentless pursuit of that elusive Premier League title? We\u2019ll find out soon enough as the 234th Merseyside derby plays out in front of our very eyes. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8.15pm GMT."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
