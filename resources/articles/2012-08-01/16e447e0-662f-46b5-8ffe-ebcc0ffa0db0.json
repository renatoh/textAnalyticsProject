St Mary's Church is one of its premier attractions, just up the windy road from the Witches Galore gift shop, and perched at the top of the village of Newchurch-in-Pendle. The visitor's book is an international directory of witch enthusiasts and, presumably, come Halloween, the place is knee deep in goths. For now, sitting alone in the pews, are actress Maxine Peake and the two hairy men with whom she's just formed a band. The band are the Eccentronic Research Council, and their first project is the 1612 Underture, a bleeping, buzzing, whirring krautrock tribute to the Pendle witches, a group of men and women who were rounded up in the villages surrounding Newchurch, and tried for witchcraft. Nine of them were hung for the crime almost exactly 400 years ago. Suffice to say that this is likely the first time that 'krautrock' and 'the Pendle witches' have been used in the same sentence . While the trio pose for pictures, Alice Nutter, the most well-to-do of the persecuted women, and the only Pendle witch with her own grave, lies outside. As career curveballs go, those unschooled in the world of Maxine Peake might find the whole business a bit baffling. One minute she's all red lipstick, judicial wigs and booze as feisty QC Martha Costello in BBC1's wildly popular legal drama Silk. The next she's aggressively tousled, wearing a sack and snogging Tom Hiddleston in Henry IV. (\"It trended on Twitter! He's very clean! And very well brought-up,\" she says. \"I did wonder if he'd ever laid one on a ruffian from Bolton before.\") Today, she's channeling her inner crone while hugging a synthesiser. How's that for range? The difficulty of pegging Maxine Peake is not limited to her acting. Musically, her tastes range from Japanese black metal, garage rock and folk, to techno and psychobilly. She's programmed Marc Riley's 6Music show with her own tracks. She went to Spike Island when she was 15 and started hyperventilating when Ian Brown came on stage (she told people it was an asthma attack). She forages in charity shops for obscure vinyl, but keeps the best spots a guarded secret. So maybe it's the other way round, and in fact all this acting is a bit out of character. Luckily, she can't play or sing for toffee, she reckons, so at 21 it was off to Rada instead. \"The films, the music, the telly that I like is always a little bit more on the margins,\" says Peake from her pew. \"In a strange way, with going into Silk, maybe this is a bit more like me, a bit more low-key and under the radar.\" She's garrulous and breezy, frequently dissolving into rattling giggles every sentence or two. She's quick to explain that she's merely helping out with this project and that the mainstays are her two hairy friends, Salfordian Adrian Flanagan of The Chanteuse &amp; The Crippled Claw, and Dean Honer, formerly of Sheffield electronic types All Seeing I and sometime producer of the Human League. Peake got together with Flanagan after he contacted her to ask if she'd fancy dressing up in a rabbit costume, arm-wrestling him and buggering about with a water pistol for an afternoon on Kersal Moor in Salford, in aid of a music video for The Chanteuse &amp; The Crippled Claw. \"I said I'd pay her in Thunderbird and a pickled egg,\" says Flanagan, who gives the impression he would work with Peake again in a heartbeat. Game as a badger, and perhaps also thirsty and peckish, Peake agreed. A shared interest in the Pendle witches (Peake has read countless books and hopes to be cast in a drama about them one day) led them on a road trip to St Mary's and the grave of Alice Nutter. The day out spawned her spoken-word contribution to the album, reading words written by Flanagan as 'a homage to the legendary Lancastrian sisterhood', delivered over Honer and Flanagan's analogue meddlings.

After a couple of warm-ups in Manchester, in September they'll headline the Secret Woods Stage at Festival No 6 in Portmeirion, the home of The Prisoner, a most appropriate platform. \"I get slightly embarrassed when actors say 'Oh, we're artists', but I want to be as creative as possible and this was another avenue\", says Peake. \"Not part of a job or a career move, just something fun. It's not about being fashionable, or cool, we've got the same taste in music and films, so it was hanging out with like-minded people. A collective of freaks! It's terrible, because I'm an actor, but telly and film I could live without, but music, I definitely couldn't.\" The story of the Lancashire witch trials, and the injustice of it all, resonates with her. Some of the so-called witches were from two destitute families, barely scraping an existence. \"These were women who were persecuted, though there are all sorts of stories threading through as to why. They were poor people trying to get by and we are back in dire times where people have to do drastic things. They were the undesirables, 'Get rid of them, we don't want them'. It's like people now being moved out of their social housing, 200 miles down the road, uprooting people from their communities.\" \"We wanted to give the Pendle witches a right to reply. In a sensitive way,\" chips in Flanagan. \"I don't think you can be a human being without feeling the resonance of their story. And I very much wanted it to come out on a Lancashire label that's female focused.\" Luckily, or more likely deliberately, they signed the project to Bird Records, the Finders Keepers spin-off for 'femme freak folk', which is really rather apt. The final track finds Peake and Flanagan getting a bit political, cursing various societal ills, from the 'rabid Cameron' and the EDL, to 'bumbling blonde mayors', though she is slightly regretful about a line which likens Nick Griffin to Terry Duckworth. \"I don't want to upset Nigel Pivaro. He lives near me, and I don't want him coming round to get me!\" she says, collapsing into another fit of giggles. Peake's politics are dyed-in-the-wool, growing up with her granddad, a communist party member. Her parents' house, however, was not a political place. \"Nothing was forced on me, but it was a big influence and I was allowed to make my own decisions,\" she says now. Instead of sticking around and joining the Salford branch of the Communist party, her head was turned to acting. \"I left because I was so focused on going to drama school and going to London. Though I think [politics is] why I got into acting and doing something creative,\" she says. From there she got her break with Victoria Wood as sarcastic dinner lady Twinkle in Dinnerladies, as Janice in Craig Cash's Early Doors and for three series as Frank Gallagher's neighbour Veronica in Shameless. Whether the critics rate the production or not, Peake performances are purest critical Teflon, seemingly impervious to vitriol. She played Myra Hindley in See No Evil, Joan Le Mesurier in Hancock &amp; Joan, which won her a Bafta nomination, and then starred in the gripping second series of Criminal Justice, Jimmy McGovern's celebrated The Street and the relentlessly bleak adaptation of Red Riding. Peake moved back to Salford five years ago after 13 years in London, during which work began to consume her more than she was happy with. Her dance with the Pendle witches might not have happened otherwise. \"That's been the good thing about coming back, doing projects like this,\" she says. \"The community's a little bit smaller. It's given me a balance. I am an actor, I love acting, and I absolutely love what I do, but I don't want it to be every waking hour. This project was never on the agenda, but it's about having fun. Enjoying yourself. I've no plan. I'll see where it takes me. I was told 'Your career's made by what you don't do', and that always stuck with me. I drive my agent mad!\" And more giggles threaten to wake up Alice Nutter who's lying next to us. Keep it down, love. Peake's Performances Dinnerladies, BBC1, 1998-2000 Victoria Wood gave Peake her big TV break when she cast her as the droll Twinkle in the gentle ensemble sitcom, allowing her to show her funny chops way before she became known for Serious Acting. Sample line: \"All right, keep your scrotum on.\" Shameless, Channel 4, 2004-2007 Still in comedy mode, Peake played Veronica, shock-blonde wife of Dean Lennox Kelly's Kev, for the first (and best) three series of Paul Abbot's comedy drama. Unfortunately Kev and Veronica were sent to prison for attempting to buy a Romanian orphan at the start of series four, and Peake never returned to the show. See No Evil, ITV1, 2006 Peake's performance as Myra Hindley in this drama about the Moors Murders proved her capacity for taking on extraordinary and difficult roles. The two-parter won a Bafta for Best Drama Serial in 2007. Criminal Justice, BBC1, 2009 The first series of Peter Moffat's extraordinary legal drama was a career-maker for Ben Whishaw; Peake starred in the equally gripping second run, accused of murdering her barrister husband. Her character remained mute for most of the five episodes, making the emotional punch even more spectacular. Silk, BBC1, 2011-present The ratings-friendly soapy legal drama, another Peter Moffat creation, has given Peake her most mainstream job to date, as lipstick fan/barrister Martha Costello. 1612 Underture is out on 3 September on Bird (Finders Keepers). Maxine Peake also performs at Festival No 6"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
