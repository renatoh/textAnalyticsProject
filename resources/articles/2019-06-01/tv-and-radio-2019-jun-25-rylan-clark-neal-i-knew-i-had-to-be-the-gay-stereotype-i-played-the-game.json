No, not Love Island \u2013 BBC Parliament. \u201cIt\u2019s such a load of bollocks, I love it!\u201d he says. \u201cHave you ever sat there and watched it on a Wednesday? It\u2019s hil-air-ious ... how prime minister\u2019s question time is not a show on terrestrial TV I have no idea. I\u2019ve never seen more liars in one room!\u201d Channel controllers take note \u2013 after all, nobody understands reality TV quite like Clark-Neal. The 30-year-old first came to most people\u2019s attention in 2012 as an outrageously camp contestant on ITV\u2019s The X Factor who couldn\u2019t really sing, but had a talent for annoying the judge Gary Barlow (and charming viewers in the process). A triumphant turn on Channel 5\u2019s Celebrity Big Brother followed, which led to a presenter\u2019s gig on the spin-off show, Big Brother\u2019s Bit on the Side, then a stint as a showbiz reporter on ITV\u2019s This Morning. Having completed a remarkable journey from national joke to national treasure, he can be heard in our front rooms in the Saturday afternoon BBC Radio 2 slot previously occupied by Zoe Ball. He says he has to pinch himself daily. \u201cYesterday I went to interview Madonna; tonight I\u2019m going to the Spice Girls, because Geri got me a ticket,\u201d he says, by way of explaining his dreams coming true. Or, to put it another way: \u201cBasically, 10-year-old me is having a wank.\u201d Today we are sitting in a quiet meeting room overlooking Regent\u2019s canal in London. Clark-Neal, who admits that he spent the photoshoot grilling the photographer about who would be interviewing him (\u201cI needed to check you weren\u2019t an arsehole\u201d), gleams so brightly that you worry about staring directly at him: not just because of the bright-white veneers, which cost him \u00a325,000 in 2013, but thanks to the brilliant-blue eyes, too. He is funny \u2013 outspoken and outrageous. Yet there is a steeliness and seriousness to him (not to mention a sweariness). After years of doing staged showbiz interviews full of made-up anecdotes, there is a sense of catharsis to his conversation: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be honest for a change,\u201d he says, before talking about his early years being bullied, the time off he took at the end of 2017 and the dawning realisation that fame hasn\u2019t turned out to be all he had hoped. Recently, he has turned his attention to another serious matter, one that may surprise those who know him best as the X Factor contestant who had a histrionic meltdown when Nicole Scherzinger told him she was putting him through to the live finals. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with Brexit,\u201d he says. Then, to prove his political knowledge, he performs an unlikely impression of the Labour MP Dawn Butler telling the Tory front bench to shush (\u201cShe\u2019s my favourite; she lets the MP mask slip\u201d). Earlier this year he tweeted about Theresa May\u2019s third meaningful vote, only to be met with a barrage of mockery from political journalists. He responded by offering to \u201cBrexit talk anyone under the table\u201d. In response, he says, \u201c90% of them deleted their tweets ... because I would come for them. You want to get people into politics and you think taking the piss is the way to do it?\u201d So, what is his analysis of the Brexit impasse? \u201cThat all roads lead to shit. Every single possible outcome will cause riots. Whatever your position, whatever you voted, even if you get what you want, it\u2019s still gonna be shit.\u201d Could he do a better job? \u201cI often think I could do a better job. Honestly, there are harder decisions to make during a series of Celebrity Big Brother than the ones they\u2019re having to make.\u201d Clark-Neal credits his time in Big Brother with changing the public\u2019s perception of him \u2013 \u201cthey realised I was normal\u201d \u2013 and his adoration goes so deep that he has modelled his house on the set. Apparently, there are Big Brother \u201ceyes\u201d above each door and the garden has been landscaped by people who worked on the show. Sadly, he says: \u201cThe only place I\u2019ve ever felt safe is the Big Brother house.\u201d His house even has a diary room for him to sit in. What does he do in there? \u201cThink,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd talk.\u201d To whom? \u201cI can make someone listen if I want to.\u201d Really? How? \u201cI can set it up so other people in the house can listen ... if I want them to.\u201d He looks slightly bashful. \u201cI live in quite a smart home. I built it from scratch, so I thought of everything ... a lot of my doors are automatic; the whole house is voice-activated.\u201d The other day, his wifi went down. He is a little embarrassed to admit that he had forgotten how to turn on the lights like a normal person. \u201cI was pressing random buttons and screaming for Alexa to help.\u201d As if to prove his hi-tech credentials, his watch suddenly starts buzzing to tell him his stepson, Cameron, is trying to call \u2013 in 2015, Clark-Neal married Dan Neal, a former police officer and Big Brother contestant, whose 19-year-old son now lives with them. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d he says, reaching for his phone. There follows an amusing conversation revolving around Cameron trying to access the house\u2019s steam room. \u201cIf you go for a swim, be careful of the robot \u2013 it\u2019s on a cleaning cycle. Oh, and dry the floor after yourself!\u201d How does he find being a stepdad? \u201cIt\u2019s the same as being a normal dad. He rinses me dry, I slap him about when he\u2019s naughty ... no, I don\u2019t, obviously \u2026 but it\u2019s the same as being a biological dad. He lives with us. I moan at him to clean up, he cleans up ... he cuts the grass, I give him some money ... it\u2019s just very normal.\u201d Clark-Neal describes himself as the man in the middle \u2013 there are 10 years between he and both Dan and Cameron \u2013 but the closeness in age helps him with some difficult conversations. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about sex with Cameron, but I can,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do warn him \u2013 if you make me a grandad at 30, I\u2019ll cut it off.\u201d Would he like more children? \u201cIt\u2019s not something I really talk about \u2013 although it always ends up in the papers anyway. But Dan\u2019s done it all now, whereas I haven\u2019t. So \u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d Clark-Neal was born Ross Richard Clark in 1988, raised by his mum and his nan in a council house in Stepney Green, east London. He says his childhood was a happy, normal one, but he was bullied: \u201cOf course I was \u2013 I was a chubby, ginger, gay kid: all I needed was a set of glasses for the full fucking set.\u201d There was a real community spirit on his street, but his mum moved the family to Essex after he was attacked at a local playground and put in hospital with a fractured skull. \u201cProbably because they thought I was gay, although I don\u2019t remember any of it. One minute I was on the rope swings, the next I was on the floor.\u201d Seeing two women bloodied and beaten in the news recently after an attack on a London bus, alleged to have been motivated by homophobia, didn\u2019t surprise him: \u201cI saw all the statuses saying: \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is happening in 2019,\u2019 but every day on my Twitter feed I\u2019ll get: \u2018You\u2019re gay, you\u2019re a cunt, people like you should be killed because you\u2019re gay.\u2019 Will things ever change?\u201d In his teens, Clark-Neal dabbled in modelling, changing his name from Ross to Rylan to be more recognisable. He performed in boyband tribute acts, then signed up to The X Factor. But he doesn\u2019t like looking back on that period of his life. \u201cI played a character when I was on there,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew I had to be the gay stereotype that was on the front of the papers every day. And I did my job well. I played the game.\u201d Does this mean that his hysterical crying in front of Scherzinger was all an act? \u201cNo, that was true,\u201d he says. \u201cBut only because we were drinking in the pool until about 7am and it was 50-degree heat and I\u2019d had an hour\u2019s sleep. I knew I only needed a week on the live shows to earn a bit of money and set myself up for a while. But you only saw a bit of the crying. It went on for 45 minutes and they had to call a paramedic. I couldn\u2019t breathe!\u201d Clark-Neal says he watches the infamous clip once a year, just to remind himself how much it all means. He loves his job and he has worked ridiculously hard for it \u2013 possibly too much, at times. He recalls the day his nan died. They were incredibly close, but he still chose to present Big Brother\u2019s Bit on the Side that night. \u201cIt was either that or sit indoors crying,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I cried, went into work, had another cry, did an hour\u2019s live show, then cried and went home. It\u2019s just how I am ... always at work, never stop.\u201d Does he worry that he is using work to deal with deeper stuff? \u201cOne hundred per cent. But I know my nan would have said: \u2018Go to work.\u2019\u201d When Clark-Neal first found fame, he lived the celebrity cliches \u2013 even buying a customised Range Rover with the silver lettering changed to Range Rylan. But, he says, he misjudged what fame would bring. Even interviewing Madonna, he says he found himself getting mobbed more than the queen of pop. \u201cNot because I\u2019m more recognisable. I\u2019m not under any illusion that I\u2019m an A-lister; I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even on the alphabet scale. But I\u2019m in people\u2019s houses every day \u2013 I\u2019m there when they wake up and there when they go to bed. So people think they know who I am. And, to a certain extent, they do.\u201d Listen to his show and it is clear why strangers view him as a friend: he is warm, witty and gets his mum to phone in and natter on about ham and cheese toasties. Still, isn\u2019t it a bit rich complaining about fame when he went all-out in search of it? \u201cIn the early days, it was all I ever wanted, more than the job,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted people to know who I was. But now, much as I\u2019m grateful for it, it\u2019s the one thing I wish I didn\u2019t have. Because I don\u2019t leave my house. If I walk down the street, people will come up. And I can\u2019t just go: \u2018Get lost,\u2019 because I\u2019m not an arsehole.\u201d He recalls a family wedding the other week \u2013 lovely people, great conversation. Then the evening approached. \u201cThat\u2019s when it started,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople who\u2019d been there all day started asking for photos. It\u2019s that constant reminder that: \u2018Oh shit, you\u2019re Rylan.\u2019 I\u2019ve lost a lot of friends over it. Especially in telly, I\u2019ve got one handful of people I can cry down the phone to and know it\u2019s between us.\u201d These days, he says, 90% of the people he meets are nice. After The X Factor, he got abuse, but if anyone tries that these days: \u201cI\u2019ll tell them to screw themselves. People might think I don\u2019t have that in me.\u201d The Range Rylan had to go \u2013 too many eagle-eyed drivers started driving alongside him with cameras out, causing him to panic at the wheel. But he blames himself: \u201cI sold my soul,\u201d he says. \u201cI went on X Factor and sold my soul \u2026 to the beast.\u201d I wonder how he feels about reality TV in today\u2019s climate, in which The Jeremy Kyle Show has been axed and Love Island heavily criticised after people who had starred in the programmes had mental health problems and even killed themselves. Clark-Neal thinks the main problem is the way fame ends suddenly once you leave the shows. \u201cThe second you walk out, you are on your own. I was very lucky. After the X Factor tour, I went back home \u2026 it was the first time I\u2019d been in a room on my own for eight months, without anyone watching me. I remember waking up at 4am and thinking: \u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019 If the phone hadn\u2019t rung with the Big Brother job a few weeks later, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done.\u201d In fact, he has worked so much that at the end of 2017 he stepped back from his gig on This Morning to look after his mental health. He says he was getting up at 5am most days and not getting home until 2am. He was also struggling to deal with other problems, particularly his mum\u2019s worsening health as a result of Crohn\u2019s disease. Yet the decision drew criticism from some. \u201cI remember seeing tweets from people saying: \u2018Who do you think you are? I\u2019ve worked for the NHS for 25 years and I\u2019m not in a position to have time off.\u2019 \u201cBut then other people will say: \u2018I never knew your mum nearly died, or was linked up to an IV drip six nights a week because she can\u2019t digest food any more.\u2019 And that\u2019s because I don\u2019t go on telly and every magazine going: \u2018Poor me, my mum\u2019s not well, now give me a tenner for the interview.\u2019 \u201cLife is complicated,\u201d he concludes, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got a set of veneers that I smile through on morning TV.\u201d After sharing his feelings about always being on duty, I feel guilty when the interview ends and I, too, ask for a favour. But my wife\u2019s grandma, who has been ill, is a huge fan, so \u2026 if he wouldn\u2019t mind \u2026 could he just do a little video message? \u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d Mildred, I say. \u201cOf course it is.\u201d He whisks my phone from my hand and starts recording: \u201cHi Mildred, it\u2019s Rylan, I hope you\u2019re well. A little birdie tells me that you listen to my radio show. Thank you, because it\u2019s nice to meet one of the three listeners. I hear you\u2019ve had a few little issues, so I\u2019m sending you all my love. And whenever you want to come to visit Radio 2, let me know.\u201d It is nothing special, really, just a video message for someone he has never met \u2013 one of dozens he will no doubt do in the next few days. But it is so effortlessly sweet that I realise why he can\u2019t walk down the street without being approached. And I think: whatever it was he sold to the beast, he definitely kept some of it back. This article was amended on 25 June 2019 to clarify that Clark-Neal\u2019s show on BBC Radio 2 is permanent. Previously, it said he was standing in for Zoe Ball."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
