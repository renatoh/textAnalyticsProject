Amid reports that 1,000 women each year find themselves forced into marriage on the sub-continent, the Conservatives will call for a special register to prevent unwanted husbands from entering the country. Under the scheme, women who want to marry abroad would have to register their plans - and provide details of their fiance - before leaving Britain. This would prevent an unsuspecting woman being taken abroad for a 'holiday', only to find that she was expected to marry a stranger, who would then be able to accompany her back to Britain. The new plan is outlined by Damian Green, the shadow immigration minister, in today's Observer. Green writes: 'The continuing existence of forced marriages in modern Britain is a stain on our social fabric. It is the extreme and unacceptable end of the clash of values between a plural democracy that values individual human rights and belief systems that regard women as second-class.' Green makes clear that the Tories have no problem with arranged marriages, not least because the new shadow cabinet minister Sayeeda Warsi had an arranged marriage herself. But the party will propose a significant strengthening of the rules to prevent forced marriages. The government's Forced Marriages Unit handles 5,000 calls for advice a year and deals with 300 cases. Greater protection would be offered to women by limiting the declaration a young bride would make as she leaves Britain - 'the intention to marry' notification - to last between three to six months. Green writes: 'This gives a further protection for young women, because if they are not persuaded of the merits of their potential husband they can delay knowing that time is on their side.' The Tories are venturing into the sensitive area of forced marriages after pressure for action from ethnic minority communities. 'This is a human rights issue that has been raised across the country,' Green says. 'There are certain practices that may be historically acceptable to some people but that have no place in our culture. The \"Britishness\" debate too often descends into worthy flannel about common values and mutual respect. To give a hard edge to what it means to be British, you have to say what is un-British. Forced marriage falls squarely into this category.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
