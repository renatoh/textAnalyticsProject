Hire former basketball star John Amaechi to give the opening keynote address at their annual conference. The first openly gay NBA player, now a psychologist who runs the Amaechi Basketball Centre in Manchester, issued a brilliantly crafted challenge to conventional wisdom that had one or two at the CCPR event spluttering into their coffee. \"We are producing people in sport at the coaching level and the administrative level who are anti-intellectual and emotionally illiterate,\" he said. Too often sport \"indulges a hierarchy of bigotry\" and promotes a culture of \"rank anti-intellectualism\". Amaechi took aim at the \"raging blazerati\" of British sports administration: \"People have existed in sport as if they have tenure. Even when they disappear from one organisation they appear in another at equal or greater status. The status quo is kind to some people \u2026 It allows for the bigots among that group and the incompetent among that group to maintain power.\" He said that governing bodies needed to take positive steps to make themselves more representative. \"You can't wait for the dinosaurs to die. They've been around for 100 years, they'll be around for another 100 if you don't act.\" The chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, Gordon Taylor, who coped well under tough questioning, nevertheless illustrated how far the sport has to go when he admitted that he would advise any 17-year-old gay player not to disclose his sexuality for fear it would damage his career. Gaydamak clarifies fund Ahead of today's meeting of Portsmouth creditors, at which administrators will seek their permission to propose a Company Voluntary Arrangement, the club's former owner Sacha Gaydamak has moved to clarify the structure of the family trust that accounts for the majority of the \u00a331.5m he claims to be owed. The creditors' report raised new questions over whether it was Sacha or his father Arcadi, whose assets have been frozen and who is currently in exile in Moscow, who invested in the club. But a spokesman for Gaydamak Jr, who has always insisted he invested his own money, told Digger that Ocadia Investments, owed \u00a322.6m of the total, was a trust set up by him for his wife and children. They, like other creditors, will be asked to accept a settlement likely to be between 20p and 25p in the pound. But creditors will not receive full details for another week or so, before voting in June to decide the club's immediate fate. Chester FC on the rise Chester City are dead, long live Chester FC. Cheshire West and Chester council will announce today that the fan-owned Chester FC has been granted the lease to the Deva Stadium. The ground, formerly occupied by City before the club went bust in March leaving a trail of unpaid taxes and debts under the ownership of Merseyside boxing promoter Stephen Vaughan, will now play host to the new club. Chester FC, who already have a membership base of 1,600, will now seek to appoint a manager, attract sponsors and begin the slow climb back through football's pyramid. The council chose the fan-owned club over a rival proposal from the Danish consortium Selskabet. Hosts to spoil the Party Food for thought for those heading for the polling station and nervous politicians: Digger's trivia department has discovered that whenever a UK election is held in the same year as a World Cup, then Labour will win if the host nation also holds the trophy aloft. That was the case in England in 1966 and again in West Germany in 1974. In 1970, however, the Tories triumphed and Brazil won in Mexico. The odds on Bafana Bafana, the least fancied host nation of all time, winning in South Africa this summer? 125-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
