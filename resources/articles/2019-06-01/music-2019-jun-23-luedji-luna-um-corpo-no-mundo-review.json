Um Corpo No Mundo (A Body in the World) is a call for racial and gender respect, delivered with sultry insouciance to an airy samba melody and a simple backing of guitar, bass and percussion. The album, much garlanded in Brazil, follows suit, celebrating an Afro-Brazilian heritage felt keenly via Luna\u2019s politically active parents (who gave her her African first name) and her northern hometown of Salvador de Bahia, Brazil\u2019s most \u201cAfrican\u201d region. That legacy is most apparent on Banho de Folhas (Bathed in Leaves), with its soukous guitar, and in the conga-led Bahian rhythms elsewhere. Luna\u2019s breezy vocals are well matched by the light touch of Swedish producer Sebastian Notini, who is nevertheless unafraid to add freeform sax to Iodo + Now Fr\u00e1gil, a broadside from a woman who believes \u201cthere is nothing in the world today more revolutionary than the black women\u2019s movement\u201d. Yet Luna mixes her politics with romance, nature and a nod to the gods. An engaging newcomer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
