Villeneuve is being courted by the millionaire businessman Gerry Forsythe. He runs the Players-backed team for which the 31-year-old Canadian won the 1995 Cart title and Indianapolis 500 before switching to formula one with Williams. Although Villeneuve is contracted to BAR for next season, the team principal, David Richards, has hinted that his \u00a312m retainer is too dear and could be better spent using Jenson Button and Olivier Panis to develop the cars. Since winning the 1997 world championship, Villeneuve has had a thin time in formula one and is being tempted with an offer to join Paul Tracy and Alex Tagliani in a three-car, all-Canadian driver line-up. \"We're looking for opportunities so Players can run three cars next year and we're looking to bring somebody back to our series who has star power,\" said Forsythe. He believes the timing for such a deal is perfect. Not only is Villeneuve disillusioned with his formula one team but 2003 is the final year before Canada tightens restrictions on tobacco sponsorship. Players is also an arm of British American Tobacco, which is a leading shareholder in and sponsor of BAR-Honda."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
