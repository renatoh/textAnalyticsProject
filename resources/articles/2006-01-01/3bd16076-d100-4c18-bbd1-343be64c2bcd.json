Under the terms of a deal announced today, the Press Association will produce non-exclusive footage for the trials, which began last December. The Association's footage will be added to that generated by the BBC to produce 10-minute local video bulletins in Birmingham, Hereford and Worcester, Shropshire, Staffordshire, the Black country and Coventry and Warwickshire. Current BBC local TV offerings include Top Darts Player Shares Secrets, playing in Hereford and Worcs, and Visitor Crisis in Pottery Museum on air in Staffordshire. The trials, which will extend for nine months have courted controversy from local newspaper groups, which fear the publicly funded, \u00a33m experiment will take eyeballs away from local classified advertising on the web. The BBC said it was experimenting with different ways of acquiring video footage during the trials. \"The BBC is anxious to work with a range of partners on this exciting project, and we are taking the opportunity to explore different ways of sourcing video news material,\" said David Holdsworth, the head of BBC West Midlands. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
