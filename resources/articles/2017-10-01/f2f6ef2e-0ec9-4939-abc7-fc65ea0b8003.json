The Chelsea manager has been linked with a return to Italy since arriving last year and, speaking before Saturday\u2019s match with Crystal Palace, rejected fresh suggestions that he could move on next summer, attributing them to a mistranslated interview. His wife, Elisabetta, and daughter Vittoria are both now living with him in Cobham after remaining in Italy during his first season at the club, and he expanded on the benefits of an improved work-life balance. \u201cFor me to have my family with me is very important,\u201d Conte said. \u201cLast season, honestly, I suffered a lot. When you are in a new country and you are alone, and know that your family don\u2019t stay here, it is not simple. This season I am very happy because my wife and daughter are with me, and for us it is a fantastic experience. I think this is an incredible experience for my daughter and a great gift I am giving her.\u201d It has provided respite from what increasingly looks a difficult title defence for the Premier League\u2019s fourth-placed side. \u201cThis season I am driving here and last season was difficult because when you are alone there is only the work,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there is my job but we also take the car to visit different areas and sometimes go to London or Kingston, or to discover new restaurants.\u201d Conte\u2019s satisfaction will ease concerns about his future although, in his earlier press conference, he had stopped short of suggesting he would stay beyond the expiry of his contract in 2019 \u2013 saying instead that, like any coach, he would \u201chope to stay for a long time and try to build something important for the club\u201d. Domestic life may be more straightforward but it has been a tricky week for Conte at Chelsea, who could be deprived of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 for the next month after he returned from international duty with a hamstring injury. \u201cWe don\u2019t have another player with the same characteristics,\u201d Conte said of Kant\u00e9, and he will also be missing \u00c1lvaro Morata and Danny Drinkwater for the visit to Crystal Palace. This week Conte has also had to deal with Charly Musonda\u2019s dissatisfaction, expressed via Instagram, at a lack of opportunities at Chelsea. He said he had spoken to the 20-year-old winger, who \u201cmust be focused on the pitch and not on social media\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
