Recently improved results had persuaded the Newcastle United manager to abandon plans to lock his players away in a hotel for four nights this week but they showed precious little gratitude here. Instead Newcastle's inadequacies were fully highlighted by a Derby side who not only stemmed a run of seven successive defeats but presented Paul Jewell with the first point of his managerial reign at Pride Park. Indeed Derby were a little unlucky not to claim what would have been only their second victory of this Premier League campaign and thereby complete an unlikely double over Newcastle. \"I'm disappointed not to have won,\" reflected Jewell whose bottom-placed side twice led on a day when they were forced to reorganise after losing their centre-half Claude Davis to a knee injury in the warm-up. \"Shambolic defending has cost us two goals but, in general, our performance was terrific,\" said Derby's manager. Jewell publicly criticised his players last week, accusing them of being \"soft\" and more concerned with image than football, but rather than sulking at being told they were overly in thrall to the prevailing \"bling culture\" Derby looked a team hell-bent on proving him wrong. \"Today we've improved, my players have come round to the way I want to do things, and at least we had a goal threat and passed the ball at times,\" said Jewell. \"We were passionate and had no little quality. Newcastle had most of the play but our goalkeeper didn't have too many world-class saves to make and with greater care and confidence we could have scored more on the break.\" Allardyce - who revealed that Michael Owen is unlikely to be match-fit until the new year - saw things differently, lamenting: \"It's very disappointing, we've missed numerous chances but sometimes you don't get what you deserve.\" Yet he could not argue that Newcastle deserved to suffer early punishment because of poor defending from David Rozehnal, as inside six minutes Derby registered only their second away league goal this season. It was created and scored by Jewell's two best players, Kenny Miller's square pass being swept home courtesy of Giles Barnes' low right-foot shot from just outside the area. Last week the manager questioned if Barnes had the attitude to maximise his undoubted talent, so when the young midfielder celebrated by pointedly thumping a fist against his chest he may have been replying. Allardyce was left to ponder the way Rozehnal turned his back and jumped over the shot. Newcastle might have responded with a goal had they been awarded a penalty when Tyrone Mears charged into Alan Smith as the striker shaped to volley. If Mears enjoyed a lucky escape then, Jay McEveley deserved plaudits for a fine block to deny Mark Viduka while Barnes emphasised his commitment by clearing Obafemi Martins' header off the line. For all that Derby regularly outpassed a worryingly unimaginative Newcastle on the counter-attack, an equaliser seemed increasingly likely. Sure enough, in the 27th minute after the visitors made a meal of failing to clear one of Charles N'Zogbia's crosses, the ball fell to Viduka and his low shot from just outside the area proved too good for Stephen Bywater. But Derby refused to fold and regained the lead on 52 minutes courtesy of Gary Teale's headed flick on and Miller's assured finish. It involved another embarrassing moment for Rozehnal, who was tricked by Miller's fancy footwork before the Scotland forward's shot eluded Shay Given. Across in the technical area Jewell performed a jig of joy, while Allardyce ordered Steven Taylor to ready himself to replace Rozehnal. Chewing gum with manic intensity, Newcastle's manager then introduced Damien Duff, newly recovered from a career-threatening ankle injury, for his first appearance of the season. If many Newcastle fans had forgotten Duff existed they were given a welcome reminder of the left-winger's skills when Bywater did well to push his cross-shot to safety. Martins had largely disappointed but, inspired by Duff, the Nigerian sparked into life and conjured Viduka's second goal with three minutes left. The second equaliser was a moment of misfortune for the previously impressive Darren Moore who was bamboozled by Martins as they contested Given's long kick upfield. Moore looked poised to deal with it but Martins flicked the ball towards Viduka, who beat Bywater with a sublime half-volley struck with the outside of his right boot. Cue a relief-suffused technical-area twirl from Allardyce. He and Jewell might just do Strictly Come Dancing one day. Man of the match Kenny Miller Miller's game was full of subtlety. He linked midfield and attack and created counter-attacking opportunities. He also created one goal and scored another. Best moment His dodging of David Rozehnal and advance into the area before scoring with a stellar finish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
