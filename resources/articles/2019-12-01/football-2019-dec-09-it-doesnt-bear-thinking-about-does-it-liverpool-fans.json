Let\u2019s start with events at the Scottish Tin Pot final, where Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers thrashed the Queen\u2019s Celtic by nil goals to one. Poor $tevie Mbe, standing there in the pouring rain, soaked to the bone, cursing Steve McClaren, unable to shelter under a brolly lest the tabloid press brands him a dry ponce. What must have been going through the poor man\u2019s dripping noggin, history repeating itself as a furious South American striker ran around kicking people for no good reason while his team\u2019s hopes of a title went up in smoke. At least he didn\u2019t slip over in a puddle, eh ladies and gentlemen, am I right, etc. Anyway, that\u2019s all terrible news for folk on Merseyside eagerly tracking $tevie\u2019s fledgling managerial career, hoping to see evidence of tangible success and/or vague signs of basic competence, either of which would come in useful when he inevitably succeeds J\u00fcrgen Klopp in 18 months\u2019 time. But it was more encouraging for those at Anfield who would argue for a less emotional appointment, based on Shearermetric data gathered by the Ljungberg Institute on their patented Olegunnarometer. (Admittedly this isn\u2019t the best day to be referencing Solskj\u00e6r in such an offhand manner, given Manchester United are now officially back, baby, on account of scoring two goals and missing a hatful of chances against a circus troupe purporting to be Manchester City. But it\u2019s a low bar at Old Trafford these days and you get the general point.) The Manchester derby was another double-edged sword for Liverpool. Sure, they\u2019re now 14 points clear of City, and no team in top-flight history has ever overcome such a gap to win the league. Problem is, that\u2019s really going to crank up the pressure on Klopp\u2019s side \u2013 just wait for the coverage next time they draw, never mind lose a game \u2013 and in any case City are currently third in a two-horse race. Leicester are now Liverpool\u2019s main rivals, a mere eight points back, scoring for fun, unencumbered by 30 years of expectation, and with Brendan Rodgers in charge ... well, it doesn\u2019t bear thinking about, does it, Liverpool fans? It doesn\u2019t bear thinking about because there\u2019s no need, it writes itself. Best to cross your fingers and hope the Foxes are 2020\u2019s version of Graham Taylor\u2019s Aston Villa, a surprise package from the Midlands that falls away quietly in March. That would complete a three-decade cycle of narrative purity. Yes, cross your fingers and keep telling yourselves that.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cEvery so often you amaze and delight with your literary acumen. No, really. Your description of Woodgate\u2019s Boro with \u2018... we could only imagine a team under his tutelage playing as though Hunter S Thompson was managing them\u2019 could well have been penned by Joyce or Bellow. The vivid imagery explodes in the mind.
