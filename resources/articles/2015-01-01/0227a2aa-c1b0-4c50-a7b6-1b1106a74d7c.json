The Liverpool winger, who has begun to impress after a subdued start at Anfield, was the subject of long-held interest from Chelsea before joining Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side for \u00a320m from Benfica last summer. Chelsea held talks with the Serbia international\u2019s former club Partizan Belgrade prior to his move to Portugal. Indeed, the then Partizan president Dragan Djuric announced the Stamford Bridge side intended to buy Markovic before loaning him to Benfica for two seasons. Chelsea then had first refusal on Benfica\u2019s 50% share of the winger after he signed a five-year contract in Lisbon and could have signed the player outright for around \u00a312.5m. However, having watched Markovic several times as Benfica won a domestic treble, Mourinho did not take up the option and Benfica were free to sell to Liverpool for a higher sum. The player who once claimed to be a Chelsea supporter insists there is no lingering resentment. \u201cI will play this match like every other match and I don\u2019t have to prove or show anything to Mourinho,\u201d says Markovic of Tuesday\u2019s first leg at Anfield. \u201cThat was Mourinho\u2019s opinion. I don\u2019t know who expected me to sign for Chelsea. I signed for Liverpool and I am extremely happy with my decision. Djuric is the ex-president so what he expected is different to what I expected.\u201d Markovic gave momentum to the Chelsea transfer stories with the occasional visit to Stamford Bridge, although he claims to have only been in west London to see friends and compatriots Nemanja Matic and Branislav Ivanovic. They, and not Mourinho, provide the 20-year-old with added incentive for a Liverpool semi-final victory. \u201cThere was never any pressure from them to sign for Chelsea,\u201d Markovic insists. \u201cOf course, there is more motivation to face Chelsea because of them. I am not sure I will be playing from the start but there is motivation to face them. \u201cI spoke to Matic before I signed for Liverpool. He told me that this is the best league and it will take time to adjust, because it took him time too, but I will get used to it. He said it was an extremely good decision. We will probably text each other before the game. Nothing special \u2013 we will just joke about who is going to win and who is going to play better.\u201d The answer would not have been in doubt until a month ago. While Chelsea\u2019s defensive midfielder conquered all before him, particularly during his side\u2019s 2-1 win at Anfield in November, Markovic had struggled to make an impact. \u201cI felt I settled very quickly off the pitch but it took time to settle on it,\u201d he admits. Since a brief appearance against Basel in December, however, when the winger was sent off for raising an arm towards the nose of Behrang Safari, Markovic\u2019s influence has grown immeasurably. \u201cBasel was very hard not only for me but everyone else,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe went out of the Champions League but I could only say to myself that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. I think the turning point came from myself and with the support of my family. I wasn\u2019t losing trust in myself but I started working harder at Melwood. When you are not achieving what you want to achieve you have to push yourself and improve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
