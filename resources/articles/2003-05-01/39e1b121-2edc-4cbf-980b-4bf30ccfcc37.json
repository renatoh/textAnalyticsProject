Despite taking control of such Labour-held councils as East Staffordshire and Hyndburn, the Conservatives are only predicted to win 34% of the national vote. Despite being the highest share of any party, it is disappointing for an opposition midway through a parliamentary term. The Tories would need 42% to win a general election. The Liberal Democrats, however, would be very pleased if their projected 31% of the national vote comes to pass. Labour would not be too upset by its predicted 31% share, particularly as the turnout has been so low. The projection, made by the BBC, was based on the first 246 wards declared, with about 576,000 votes counted. The British National party has also made gains in Burnley, now controlling eight seats. Though its leader, Nick Griffin, has failed in his bid to win a seat on Oldham council. Elections have been taking place for the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly and for nearly 12,000 seats on around 340 councils in England and Scotland. As well as the Conservatives hoping to make gains in local government, the Scottish National party (SNP) and Plaid Cymru are hoping to unseat the Lib-Lab coalitions which govern Scotland and Wales. A low turnout by the 38 million eligible to vote today will reinforce the fear that public indifference to politics is deepening and undermine the politicians' claim to be meeting the challenge. Pundits and parties are predicting around a 30% turnout in the local elections and closer to 50% in the assembly polls. That is despite today's poll being the biggest test of public opinion since the 2001 general election. Then the turnout fell to a record low of 59%. The only clear political sunshine on a rainy polling day in many parts of Britain was a surge of voting in places experimenting with the use of postal votes instead of ballot boxes. From Blackpool and Rotherham in the north to prosperous Guildford in the home counties, the replacement of ballot boxes by postal votes increased the turnout, from below 30% to nearly 60% in some places. With the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives seeking to take seats from one another in much of England, the stakes were highest for the Tory leader, Iain Duncan Smith. Despite his modest target, his aides are expecting to win up to 200 new seats, knowing that a leadership challenge might follow perceived failure. Tony Blair was hoping for a \"Baghdad bounce\" following his firm leadership in the Iraq crisis. But Labour officials were also braced for the effects of voter apathy and defections by supporters angry about the war, public service reform, or even the mishandling of the new family tax credits. The fear of a low turnout for Holyrood's first big test - it was only the second election to a Scottish parliament in 300 years - appeared to be well founded. By early afternoon only 14% of Glaswegian voters had been to the polls and polling stations throughout the country reported slow voting, exacerbated by heavy rain. Some analysts were predicting that the turnout might fall below 50% and party leaders have warned that the devolution project could be seriously damaged by a poor showing. It was expected that a low turnout would hit Labour hardest. But the polls show it still on track to be the biggest party in the 129-seat parliament. In Wales, the Labour leader and first secretary, Rhodri Morgan, insisted that Iraq was not an issue in the election, in which the turnout threatened to dip below the 47% recorded in the first assembly elections four years ago. He said that in the eight days to Tuesday, the war had not been raised with him on doorsteps once, until he was posed a question about the Middle East peace process. \"I have been shaking hands with hundreds and hundreds of people, if not thousands, and Iraq was not an issue. We have returned to domestic political issues,\" he said. But Holyrood's PR voting system means that Scottish Labour is likely to need the support of the Liberal Democrats to form a second coalition government. The Lib Dems demanded the deferment of tuition fees in 1999; PR in local government elections is likely to be their asking price this time round. Many of the Scottish Labour leader Jack McConnell's own party are vehemently opposed to PR and coalition talks are likely to be tortuous and protracted. The minority parties are expected to perform best as disaffected mainstream voters express their anger. The Scottish Socialists, led by Tommy Sheridan, have been tipped to win up to nine seats. Mr Sheridan, who cast his vote early in Glasgow, said he would do handstands if the SSP won up to four seats and somersaults if they won more. John Swinney, leader of the Scottish National party, was in bullish mood as he voted in his Tayside constituency, despite his lacklustre campaign as leader. Privately, officials have said they fear the party has not persuaded voters to take the next step to independence. Despite the sluggish response from voters, Professor Robert Hazell, head of the University College London constitution unit , said a low turnout should not be seen as a rejection of devolution. \"Low turnout results from a failure of the political parties to engage the electorate, and is not a failure of devolution itself,\" he said. In Wales, Labour's strategy was to win three seats more than the 28 gained last time to secure an overall majority, permitting Mr Morgan to ditch the Liberal Democrats as coalition partners. Plaid Cymru was defending 17 seats, including those in the south Wales valleys where the Tories took nine and the Liberal Democrats six in 1999. The Tories tried to make asylum a big issue and fought an unashamedly anti-assembly campaign.
