Distin is out of contract at the end of the season and his situation has alerted several Premier League clubs to his potential availability. David Moyes, however, is keen to extend the central defender's stay on Merseyside, with the veteran's injury record and form impressive since his \u00a35m arrival from Portsmouth in 2009, and talks have progressed on another 12-month extension. Fellow defender Phil Jagielka committed his future to Everton until 2017 last week and the club have also lined up a new deal for midfielder Leon Osman. Andy Hunter Various David Beckham will make a decision on his future next week after receiving 12 offers from around the world but the former England captain is not expected to return to the Premier League. The 37-year-old has offers from Europe, South America, North America, South Africa, Russia, China and the Middle East, but the player's representatives have not received a reported offer of a two-year deal from Qatari officials. There is however interest from Paris Saint-Germain who are owned by the Qatari government. They are also still in the Champions League, which would be attractive to Beckham. PA West Brom West Bromwich Albion will retain the services of their on-loan Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku for the rest of the season. Lukaku joined Albion for the whole season, though Chelsea had the option to recall the player this month. However, the deadline for that recall expired on Monday.
