For the moment, though, Ricky Sbragia's name remains on the manager's door at the Stadium of Light and he hopes to keep it that way. If Sunderland win at Portsmouth on Monday they will assure Premier League survival for another season and Sbragia hopes to spend it at the helm. \"I've got my own pride,\" said Roy Keane's successor who, without any managerial experience, was promoted from his role as first-team coach in December. \"I want to be a manager for many years to come. My biggest task is to make sure we stay in this division. I hope to achieve that on Monday. The last thing I want is for us to be still in danger of relegation on the final day of the season [when Sunderland host Chelsea].\" \"I hope that we can stay up and that I can then be here for the next two or three years trying to build something and bring better players here. Niall [Quinn, Sunderland's chairman] has just told me to get us over the line and stay up. The constant speculation about my future hasn't affected me but it would mean everything to me to keep Sunderland in the Premier League.\" If Quinn's failure to elaborate on the future suggests he harbours doubts about Sbragia's long-term potential, the Scot is sufficiently honest to admit he has made mistakes. \"I believe we have enough to stay up and get over the line,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, though, we just haven't produced enough consistency. That's been disappointing and would be down to my naivety as a manager. I've shaped the team and picked the team.\" A naturally laid-back character, the 52-year-old acknowledges he has been affected by the pressures of management and, mentally, struggled to get away from it all on his day off last Monday when he prayed for the Tyne-Tees derby between Newcastle and Middlesbrough to end in a draw. \"I spent the night of the game at a pub in north Yorkshire which only holds 28 people and does not have a television,\" explained Sbragia. \"I'd been dropped off after doing time with my wife. I'd had a day off and we'd been walking all day, for nine hours. But in the pub I was thinking about phoning home to get the score.\" He resisted temptation, only discovering Newcastle had won shortly before 10pm. \"You get uptight and you're touching wood all the time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
