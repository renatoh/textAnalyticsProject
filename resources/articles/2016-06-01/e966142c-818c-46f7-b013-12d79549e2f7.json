Day 33 of the election campaign and there are now, officially, just over three weeks to go, which almost sounds a reasonable period of time to be following political leaders around on buses and pressing them on their fiscal responsibility. Speaking of which, Labor appears set this morning to strap on its zombie-hunting gear and address some of those budget cuts that have languished on the notice paper since the former treasurer Joe Hockey\u2019s strident 2014 budget. These are measures, such as cuts to family payments, that Labor has long opposed and dubbed \u201czombie savings\u201d because, while technically on the books, the Coalition has not been able to get them past the Senate. We\u2019ve yet to see the full detail, so here\u2019s the speculation. The big picture The Labor party is trying to shake the impression that they\u2019ve got red on them by announcing a new round of savings, which will reportedly include support for some of those Hockey budget cuts it has argued against for the past two years. Labor will announce its own proposed changes to the family tax benefit, which it says will target higher-income households and protect those most in need. In a statement to Fairfax Media, a Labor spokesperson said: There are several Abbott-Hockey budget measures that have are stuck in the parliament. Despite not passing the parliament, they remain in the budget. On Friday Labor will confirm its position on these \u2018zombie measures\u2019. We will resolve not to oppose some measures, and confirm our continued opposition to others. The ones we commit to reverse will be removed from our bottom line. This will mean the government\u2019s budget contains unlegislated zombie measures, but ours will not.\u201d We will announce some new measures that better target family payments, while protecting those who need support the most. Families will still be better off under Labor.\u201d The Coalition has argued those \u201czombie savings\u201d (definitely not their term) are worth $18.1bn but Labor is relying on costings from the Parliamentary Budget Office, which say they\u2019re worth about $9bn. In another dispute over the price of things, the Coalition has maintained that Labor\u2019s economic plan has a black hole of $67bn, while the PBO has it at $22bn. What\u2019s a mere $45bn between friends? Meanwhile Nick Xenophon, leader of the Nick Xenophon Team (NXT), has told the Conversation\u2019s Michelle Grattan there is only a 0.0001% chance this election will end in a hung parliament, but if it does, he\u2019ll be \u201cpragmatic and constructive with whomever forms government\u201d. NXT is on track for at least three Senate seats in SA and possibly the lower house seat of Mayo, held by Liberal Jamie Briggs. Xenophon outlined his appeal in this rather extraordinary sentence: Because I think people are fed up with the cosy Coles-Woolies duopoly of the major parties; that they feel it is a case of Tweedledum and Tweedledee; that after seeing the so-called leaders\u2019 debate a couple of Sundays ago, it almost felt like the Seinfeld election \u2013 an election about not much at all. You can read the full interview here. On the campaign trail Both Bill Shorten and Malcolm Turnbull will be in Sydney today, where the focus will remain on the budget. The campaign you should be watching The Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, has been accused of pork-barrelling after announcing on Wednesday that he would move the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority from Canberra to Armidale. The move would bring 175 jobs to his seat of New England, where Joyce is facing a tough battle from former independent MP Tony Windsor, but the Community and Public Sector Union has argued that it would also mean the loss of almost 200 experienced researchers and staff, most of whom have said they don\u2019t want to pack up and go country. Joyce, according to Fairfax Media, has played down the move, saying that while there may be \u201capprehensiveness from some ... we\u2019re not asking people to move to Kathmandu or Timbuktu\u201d. When they started moving departments to Canberra, Canberra wasn\u2019t there, here we have a beautiful, vibrant, excited, cultivated and well-established city and also great for families. This will be a good move. The opposition agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said the proposed move made no sense, telling ABC radio in Canberra: The APVMA is a regulatory authority, it deals with the chemical companies that produce the crop protection chemicals for [inaudible] the farmers and of course veterinarian medicines etc. Their interface is with the multinational companies, not with farmers. Rob Oakeshott leaves the nation hanging ... again Former independent MP Rob Oakeshott may or may not be recontesting his former set of Lyme: we\u2019ll have to wait until midday to find out. In an interesting move, Oakeshott has refused to confirm whether he had put his hand up, telling the Australian it would have to wait until the Australian Electoral Commission published the full list of candidates at midday today. Nominations closed yesterday.Oakeshott has form when it comes to keeping people waiting. He famously spoke for 17 minutes after the 2010 hung election before finally announcing he would back Julia Gillard\u2019s government.Like his former crossbench colleague Tony Windsor, Oakeshott resigned from parliament at the 2013 election, saying \u201cthe demands on an independent MP in a regional seat are very high\u201d.Windsor is recontesting his former seat of New England. And another thing(s) The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, joined the former prime minister John Howard at the 10th anniversary dinner for the American Australian Association and US Studies Centre in Sydney last night, and continued the tradition of Australian leaders gushing over the US of A. He also touched on the importance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership: Similarly, in the new strategic domain of cyberspace, President Obama and I share a deep commitment to ensuring that the architecture and administration of the internet remains free of government domination, without deteriorating into a lawless domain. Speaking of the US, the Democratic presidential nominee, Hilary Clinton, had this to say when Donald Trump questioned Obama\u2019s endorsement: Follow the day\u2019s developments live \u2022 Sign up here to receive your Campaign catchup in your inbox every afternoon"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
