Boris's tanks surround the moat. Soon they will cross. Cry villainy; infamy. Tory sources say Dave's last hope is to be a reshuffle. Yesterday the Mail said there will be a promotion for Iain Duncan Smith, awaiting deployment to sort things out at the justice ministry. And off to the tower with Ken Clarke. But if there is to be a night of the long knives, might Dave not profitably shed some blood in the Lords, where many feel his leader Lord Strathclyde has been struggling. Just the other day he was beastly to Labour peer Lord Barnett, in a setting where beastliness is not seen as a good thing. On a more practical level, he has found it difficult to get peers to do Dave's bidding. In his blog, Lord Harris of Haringey, never one to gossip, reports that he has been privy to the murmuring. \"I am told no less a personage, if such a thing were possible, than the Baroness Anelay of St Johns \u2013 the government chief whip and Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentleman-at-Arms \u2013 has let it be known that she is ready to take on the burden of the leadership were it to fall on her shoulders,\" he says. \"It is not, of course, immediately apparent why Baroness Anelay \u2013 aka 'The Steel Magnolia' \u2013 would have more success than the hapless \u2013 and grumpy \u2013 Lord Strathclyde.\" Success is never certain, but with the forces of Boris at the gates, it does seem better to do something than nothing. The barricades are weakening and time is short. \u2022 As Mitt Romney recovers from his international gaffe-fest here and in Israel, it's interesting to note that the Sun felt bold enough to join the rubbishing with a \"Mitt the twit\" headline the other day. This in the face of a clutch of tweets from old man Murdoch supporting Romney. But they read the runes at Wapping, and it seems likely that the new line springs from Rupert's tweet last week: \"(Obama) will be hard to beat unless Romney drops old friends from his team.\" The master is not happy. The Sun is not happy. Raise your game, Mitt. \u2022 Many tributes in recent days to Sally Ride, the first US woman in space, who died last week. We learned two things: she had cancer; and she was gay \u2013 both of which she kept private. Enter Newsweek magazine and a posthumous scuffing. Why didn't she come out, says writer Linda Hirshman in the first article of this week's edition. \"Instead of pulling her weight she was free riding \u2026 she missed her chance to do something right \u2026 she denied the movement a valuable asset.\" An arguable case. But there's no obit in this paper edition. No appreciation. Just a scuffing. Nice, don't you think? \u2022 Meanwhile, in the wake of the much-heralded opening ceremony, good to see that the rest of London is joining in the celebration of British irony. Full marks to Browns, a well-known and much-frequented establishment in Shoreditch, which is flying the Olympic flag alongside the union flag this week outside its front door. Clearly anxious that all comers should feel at ease, a notice outside Browns asks members of the public \"if you witness any sexist behaviour please report it to this establishment\". And what goes on inside Browns? It is one of London's oldest \"gentlemen's clubs\", specialising in lapdancing and striptease. Equality guaranteed. \u2022 Finally, for all who crave entry to the magic circle of celebrity, a reminder that it doesn't always bring the hoped-for recognition. The famous struggle to recognise each other, it would appear. And the biggest problem, says Hugh Cornwell, former frontman of punk veterans the Stranglers, is seeing fellow performers out of context. \"The last time I was embarrassed was last week,\" Hugh tells Mojo magazine. \"I went into my gym and I was confronted with Jarvis Cocker in the changing rooms. I met him a couple of times before but I didn't know him that well. I went up to him and called him Jasper. Which I was very, very embarrassed about.\" Hugh apologised profusely. \"But he was very nice and he was totally understanding.\" Probably thought he was talking to Bono.
