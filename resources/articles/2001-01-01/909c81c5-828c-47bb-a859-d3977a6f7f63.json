You're probably too young to worry about that. Anyway, after a long day lugging your rucksack around, you'll be too worn out to do anything except flop into a bunkbed. But I'm married with four children. In that case, you can hire a family room. But the principle remains the same. And what's wrong with the British YHA site? Nothing it all - in fact, it's pretty good, and nowadays some of the more progressive hostels even offer online booking. But I thought you'd be more interested in the (unofficial) international version, because it means you can plan a cheap trip abroad in advance. The International Youth Hostelling Federation site at www.iyhf.org will tell you which hostels require YHA membership and offers links to national sites but hostels.com covers virtually every country. I'm not inspired yet. It's those dormitories again! Not all hostels are spartan. In some New Zealand hostels (www.yha.org.nz), double rooms and hot pools are standard. In St Petersburg, where tourist visas are \"no problem\", a double room in low season will cost $21. And the best deal? Probably the Amazon Hostel at the head of the Rio Camarao Grande river. You'll need to bring your own hammock, and there is no electricity, hot showers or telephone; but a week costs only $75. Entomologists and botanists pay less."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
