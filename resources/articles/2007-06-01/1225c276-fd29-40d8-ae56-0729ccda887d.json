Each student at the Eckington Manor Cookery School near Pershore will have his or her own 'mini-kitchen' area, with a Falcon, Rangemaster or Aga cooker and a stocked fridge. There are 10 of these around a central demonstration area. Guests stay in the 700-year-old timber-framed house on the 260-acre Manor Farm, and cook with the farm's products. A wide range of courses, from an Aga taster day to sushi, bread or chocolate classes cost from \u00a3150 a day for the course, \u00a375 a night for accommodation.
