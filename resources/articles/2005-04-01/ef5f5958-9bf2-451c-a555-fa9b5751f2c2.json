The host town of the Masters, as opposed to the host golf course, is not pretty, though for Lee Elder this week ugly old Augusta feels almost like paradise. Thirty years after he became the first African-American golfer to play in the Masters, Elder made his annual journey to the tournament this year with extra purpose, for - in the words of Augusta's mayor Bob Young at a civic reception this week - Monday April 4 2005 was \"Lee Elder Day\". That it was also Jack Nicklaus Day and, bizarrely, Vaughn Taylor Day (he is a journeyman PGA tour pro who went to a local college) scarcely mattered; not to Elder, not to the 5,000 people who gathered at Augusta's botanical gardens on a balmy spring night, and not to anyone who has followed the Augusta National golf club's shamefully racist past. Today Tiger Woods, the only black American in the field, is feted like a champion, but when Elder turned up to play in the 1975 Masters he did so in an atmosphere of pure hatred. \"I'd received maybe 20 death threats. The people I confided in at the time didn't want me to come at all because they were scared for my life,\" he recalls. \"That's why I couldn't get comfortable for the whole week. The only time I felt safe was on the golf course.\" That Elder was allowed to play at Augusta at all was entirely the result of his talent overcoming the prejudice of Clifford Roberts, the then chairman of Augusta National. Ask the helpful press officers at the Masters about the subject of race and they will hand you a wickedly one-sided book excerpt on the subject, which rails against alleged media \"misrepresentation\" of the club's history but fails to reference Roberts' notorious remark on how he viewed the club's racial divide: \"Golfers will be white and caddies will be black\". Roberts was as good as his word and through outrageous manipulation of the qualification criteria over the years contrived to keep black golfers, among them Charlie Sifford and Pete Brown, out of his tournament. Elder was another victim of Roberts' efforts, most notably after winning the 1971 Nigerian Open. Previous winners of the tournament had been invited to play in the Masters but when Elder won the event no invitation was forthcoming. In the end, not even Roberts could keep him out. The rules stated that any player who won an event on the US tour automatically received an invitation to the Masters. Elder won the 1974 Monsanto Open in Florida and decided to accept the invitation. \"I wanted to come and play at Augusta because it was an historical moment. I had accomplished something no other black player had accomplished. I felt if I didn't come it would only prolong what had happened in the past,\" he says. \"You know, I played golf in South Africa in 1972, when apartheid was at its worst, before I played at Augusta - a golf course in my own country, a country for which I served,\" he recalls, adding with a smile: \"Plus I wanted to make him [Roberts] eat his words.\" Elder missed the cut in 1975. He played in the tournament another six times over the next eight years but never had much success - Augusta, which favours players who can draw the ball, didn't suit his game. In recent years he has occasionally played the course, but only when accompanied by a member. He has no status at the club, though it does send him a couple of Masters tickets every year. \"You should note that it is Augusta the town that is honouring me, and not Augusta the golf club,\" he says. Nor is it likely to honour him any time soon, not least because he isn't afraid to voice the kind of opinions that sit uneasily with those who run the club these days; on the subject of admitting women members, for instance: \"I wouldn't want to be a member of any club that didn't have women members.\" Still, they can do nothing about the memory that Lee Elder left Augusta with in 1975. \"On the way out, after I had finished playing, every black person who worked at the club - caddies, servants, the people who worked in the restaurants - was lined up against the wall, waiting for me, waiting to congratulate me and thank me for what I had done.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
