Before the starting gun was fired on the 2001 vote, soothsayers and net gurus were making suitably sci-fi noises that the year (and the general election) would live up to its famous film namesake. We were promised live webcasts, leaders online, mass emailing and an almost unlimited range of free access political websites letting the unwashed masses discover the policies and parties other media couldn't reach. Unfortunately even net evangelists have had to admit it hasn't quite worked out that way. New research out today by the Industrial Society suggests that so-called \"cyber citizens\" [those who have access to the internet either at work or home] are actually less likely to vote, ignore the expensive party websites and have less interest in directly contacting the political parties than those without web access. The society's evidence, which comes from a national opinion poll and two focus groups in marginal constituencies, shows that far from blazing a trail, 84% of internet users actively avoid politics on the net. In addition, only 45% of those with internet access are \"certain\" to vote - a drop of 10% on the figure for non-surfers. There was a silver lining in this dot.com cloud though: the survey found that almost 75% of interested online users would visit a new media outlet provided by a traditional media owner - such as Guardian Unlimited - even if only 33% of voters would bother to email either a party leader or a local candidate. The author of the report, James Crabtree, said: \"This election has not seen the dawn of a new era of digital democracy.\" Indeed, just 2% of internet users say they are certain to use the internet to gain information about the election. All this will be grist to the mill of election planners at both Millbank and Conservative central office who talked a great deal before the election about email campaigning but have let their primary focus continue to be the broadcasters and the newspapers. However, that is not to say that the internet has been completely ignored in this campaign. To tie in with its \"mortgage day\" earlier this week, the Labour party took out its first web banner ad of the campaign. Paying an undisclosed amount to one of the UK's leading online mortgage brokers, the ad ran in three parts: \"Fancy saving / \u00a312,000 / on your mortgage?\" It then took browsers through to a specially constructed mortgage reckoner, allegedly demonstrating how much cheaper mortgages are under Labour than the Tories. Labour is also claiming victory in the gameplaying stakes, having launched two interactive, albeit simple and old-fashioned shoot 'em up-style arcade games on its site. One Pacman-style game allows the player to run around a maze as a pair of scissors, cutting nurses, policemen and hospital beds. The other shows Michael \"Plotillo\" outside a leadership HQ, whilst William Hague is in a bar sinking 14 pints. And in a bid for the youth vote Labour's R U Up 4 It website offers young voters a scratchcard with a personalised PIN number to \"give access to lots of free stuff\". The site also runs a questionnaire - \"They're all the same, or are they?\" - which outlines the big issues for first timers. To back all this up, leader Tony Blair will grace the site with his first online debate of the campaign, with two sessions on the Labour site this afternoon. Only the publicly-funded BBC has managed to secure an internet chat with the prime minister. However the Tories are fighting back. Yesterday, party chairman Michael Ancram launched \"My manifesto\" - a facility which allows users to shape the Conservative manifesto as they like: the form of it that is, not the policies. The Conservative party is also buoyed by findings from the internet measurement firm Gomez, which found that the Tory party website is five times faster than Labour's. More worryingly for Labour, Gomez's research also revealed that the Labour website failed 15 times more than the average site. Labour has dismissed the findings as \"crap.\" A spokesman said; \"Gomez themselves admit more people are visiting Labour's site than the Tories, and most users tell us they find the content on our site useful and easy to find. \"Things like localised information via a clickable map on what we've done, plus our family manifesto and full manifesto on pdf have all been popular. None of this is even offered by the Tories,\" he added. The Liberal Democrats are, by nature and by necessity, more modest. There are no games or interactive graphics on the third party's site but, like Labour, they send a daily email to supporters and floating voters, listing their achievements. Unfortunately, this email usually appears to be blank unless users have the savvy to scroll down through its initial white space. In contrast to the mainstream parties' earnest efforts to get their message across, it is the jokes and satirical games doing the email rounds between colleagues and friends that have been the true online \"breakthrough\" in this election. The John Prescott punch alone inspired at least four different emailed games. James Crabtree, who commissioned the survey, concludes: \"There is a silver lining for politics on the web. \"Voters clearly like what they see if they decide to go online. Politicians must realise the next internet election starts on June 8.\" Related articles 31.05.2001: Labour rejects Tory tax 'smear' 31.05.2001: Candidate in the right camp 31.05.2001: Blair pledge to stem 'yob attacks' on public staff 31.05.2001: Hague shows the strain as new polls deepen Tory gloom 31.05.2001: Brown throws weight behind regionalism 31.05.2001: Tory manifesto 'least environment-minded in living memory' 31.05.2001: Labour makes pitch for youth vote to boost turnout 31.05.2001: A decent fellow leading a lost cause 31.05.2001: Labour plan to help parents gain flexible work 31.05.2001: Thatcher minister defects 31.05.2001: Lib Dems and Tories battle for grey vote Comment and analysis 31.05.2001, Kathryn Flett: Something of Severus Snape about him... 31.05.2001, Jonathan Freedland: It's got to be Labour 31.05.2001, Ed Harriman: Putting the dirt back into politics 31.05.2001, Stephen Bates: Labour's wake-up call restores eye contact in Wales 31.05.2001, Hilary Wainwright: A piece of paper and a team of lawyers isn't enough 31.05.2001, Hugo Young: Canny voters take it personally 31.05.2001, Sarah Boseley: Chancellor delivers moral message on killer diseases 31.05.2001, Simon Hoggart: When Honor met Chucky in a spirit of pushy galore Today's picture gallery On the campaign trail today Interactive quizzes Can you be bothered?
