That's the premise of this good-natured but insipid vehicle for tween star Selena Gomez, which promises all your dreams can come true if only you remember to stay true to yourself \u2013 though, naturally, that realisation only comes after Gomez spends a week impersonating said heiress around the balls and polo fields of Monte Carlo, with what are intended to be \"predictably hilarious consequences\". Though Gomez is the star, what spark the film delivers comes from Gossip Girl's Leighton Meester, playing Gomez's uptight stepsister. She's the only actor who doesn't sound as if she's in a desultory rehearsal for a school play, and is more winning by far than Gomez."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
