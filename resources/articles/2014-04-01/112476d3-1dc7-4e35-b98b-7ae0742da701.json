Musicians will roll their eyes. Parents will grind their teeth. But however widely despised, the recorder has to be acknowledged as the instrument that has introduced more people to the pleasure of making music than any other. Now, as a new survey reveals that record numbers of children are getting a practical musical education, the humble recorder emerges once again as the most-played instrument. It is simple to make a sound on, and a perfectly good one can still cost under \u00a310. According to research by YouGov for the Philharmonia Orchestra, which launches its innovative engagement project iOrchestra in Plymouth on Tuesday, two-thirds of children nowadays learn an instrument. A fifth of them start on a recorder. The iOrchestra experience, where visitors are invited to be virtual conductors \u2013 or real percussionists \u2013 doesn't actually feature recorders. But every musician has to start somewhere."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
