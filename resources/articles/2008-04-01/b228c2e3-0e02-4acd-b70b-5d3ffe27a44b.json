Play in the match between the MCC and the champion county was held up for five minutes while Kirby received treatment before being led, groggily, from the field. The player lost consciousness twice, once on the pitch, where the Sussex team and Chris Adams and Matthew Prior in particular were quick to get him into the recovery position, and again in the pavilion. While on the field, he was treated by the England and Wales Cricket Board physio, Steve McCaig. David Parsons, the national performance director, said last night: \"It was typical of Kirbs - he wanted to go back out and continue his batting and also have a bowl. We think he's OK but we sent him to hospital as a precaution.\" Kirby, 30, who toured India with the England Lions last winter, appeared to duck into the delivery. His MCC team-mate Charlie Shreck said: \"It seemed to follow him down the hill. It was nasty because he was out cold for half a minute.\" Kirby had been the star MCC bowler on Thursday when he took four Sussex wickets. Wright, 23, has made his name as an innovative and occasionally spectacular batsman in the England one-day side and scored 50 on his ODI debut against India last year. He is not known for being a particularly dangerous bowler. This season, however, he appears to have added a yard of pace and here, where the ball has seamed from the start of the match, he has looked an uncomfortable proposition. When Kirby retired hurt the MCC innings closed on 205, a lead of 34. They had resumed on 130 for four but lost the overnight batsman Owais Shah in the third over of the morning, top-edging an attempted pull to mid-on without adding to his overnight 72. Only seven runs were scored in the opening hour. Just before lunch a hailstorm drove the players from the field. RyanHarris was the most successful Sussex bowler with figures of four for 36. When Sussex batted again they had moved ahead of the MCC before the opener Carl Hopkinson was lbw to Ravi Bopara for 30. Meanwhile, the ECB announced yesterday that the Rose Bowl will host a Test match in 2011. The first Ashes Test next summer will be played at Cardiff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
