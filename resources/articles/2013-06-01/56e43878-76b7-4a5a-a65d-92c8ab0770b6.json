A seven-try to two victory in Buenos Aires meant that Lancaster's side became the first England team to win all of their Tests on Argentinian soil following the 32\u20113 victory in Salta last week. Admittedly, the calibre of the opposition somewhat lessens the achievement, with Argentina missing 21 players before the Rugby Championship, but England were also without the majority of their key performers. In their place a new generation emerged, including eight debutants, and impressively staked their claim to retain their starting berths for the autumn internationals. Sometimes summer tours can be a factory for one-cap wonders; the chances of adding Matt Kvesic, Marland Yarde, Kyle Eastmond and Christian Wade, the wing who was called up by the Lions hours before kick-off, to that undistinguished club are slim. In his previous guise as the RFU's elite rugby director, Lancaster always knew that such talent was bubbling under the surface in the English game, yet until now he was unaware if they were ready for the rigours of Test rugby. \"The players have been outstanding to work with,\" Lancaster said. \"They are very talented and from an England rugby point of view we have a strong few years to come. We have a generation of players coming through who should be here way beyond 2015. I very much see this tour as a staging post for the World Cup. It's a pleasing step forward and this tour was always going to be critical in our development towards 2015 because it gave the opportunity to bring other players through. \"It gives me confidence and also reassurance that the direction we are going in is the right one. I was always confident in my old role that we had quality players coming through the pipeline. They have been blooded in the Premiership, they have played in big games in the Premiership and in Europe and now they are making the step from club to country. Someone like Marland has taken to it brilliantly.\" The players that were rested \u2013 Chris Ashton, Chris Robshaw, Brad Barritt, Toby Flood and Danny Care \u2013 have been assured that their places in the next senior elite player squad are secure. Nevertheless those left behind and on Lions duty in Australia will have cause for alarm. In England's last four matches of the Six Nations they conjured one try; in the four against the Barbarians, a South American XV and Argentina they have rattled up 22. The personnel was different and so was the mindset. \"We want to carry on playing in that manner,\" Lancaster said. \"Sometimes you have to play wet-weather rugby but certainly in this environment we like to show that we can play and I think that we did.\" They also had to overcome a strong start by Argentina, who were leading 12-6 approaching the half-hour mark. Within 10 minutes England had moved out of sight through a Freddie Burns try and a pair of penalty tries, even if Manuel Montero scored just after half-time. Then it was the turn of the three-quarter line. Rob Webber, the hooker, touched down in the left-hand corner after the ball was spread at speed before Yarde, on his debut, flew down the short side. Eastmond, the rugby league convert, marked his first start with a try by slaloming through six tackles and then provided a gorgeous inside ball for Yarde to score his second. It was a performance that will give Lancaster much to ponder on his flight to Australia to see the Lions.
