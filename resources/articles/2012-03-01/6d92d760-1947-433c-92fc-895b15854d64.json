It will probably be at least another two years before its shattered community decide where and how to rebuild. But at sea, the fishermen are re-seeding their oyster and scallop beds and finding novel ways to fund replacements for the boats and equipment they lost. The disaster all but wiped out the industry. There are only 40 fishermen left out of 250 in Ogatsu alone. Today a younger breed are determined to carry on in the hope that oyster and seaweed production will return to pre-tsunami levels in two years. Outsiders are coming in with fresh ideas of how to market new fishing ventures. Companies are helping once closed communities to get back on their feet. The force of the sea was such that the coastline sunk by a metre. Now thanks to the fishermen's spirit, the sea is beginning to give something back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
