More or less everything he touches turns to gold. In Paranormal Activity, he produced the most profitable film ever made. In The Purge he helped produce a franchise of amazing longevity. In BlacKkKlansman, he produced Spike Lee\u2019s finest work in a decade. In Whiplash he produced a masterpiece. In Get Out he produced an even better masterpiece. Most incredibly of all, in Halloween he produced a Halloween sequel that wasn\u2019t an absolute horse turd. The man can do no wrong. Which is why I am confident in stating that his most recently announced film will be another Oscar-winning, genre-bending blockbuster. It is \u2026 let me see. Oh. It\u2019s a movie about a Magic 8 Ball. That can\u2019t be right. No, apparently it is. Blumhouse, Mattel and director Jeff Wadlow really are teaming up to make a film about a toy that issues vaguely worded decisions if you shake it hard enough. \u201cSince the 1950s, Magic 8 Ball has inspired imagination, suspense and intrigue across generations,\u201d Robbie Brenner of Mattel Films told Deadline. \u201cThis iconic toy has a built-in connection with fans and untapped potential for storytelling.\u201d Obviously this is a good time to point out that \u201cuntapped\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically mean \u201cgreat\u201d. Maybe the cinematic potential for a Magic 8 Ball movie is untapped because it doesn\u2019t really exist. To make matters worse, the potential isn\u2019t actually all that untapped, because people have been unsuccessfully trying to make a Magic 8 ball movie for years. In 2006, Ace Ventura\u2019s Tom Shadyac was hired by Universal to make a Magic 8 Ball romcom. When that didn\u2019t work, Paramount hired Jon Gunn and John Mann to write a National Treasure-style Magic 8 Ball movie which similarly failed to see the light of day. But third time\u2019s a charm. And now the film has the best shot of getting off the ground, because it\u2019s a Blumhouse film, so it\u2019s bound to exist within the horror/thriller arena. And that suits a Magic 8 Ball much better than almost any other genre. You can\u2019t have a Magic 8 Ball make all the decisions in a romcom, because then the human protagonists would lose all their agency and invariably end up in a hellish, joyless variation of arranged marriage. And you can\u2019t make an action-adventure Magic 8 Ball movie, because imagine how crap Raiders of the Lost Ark would be if Indiana Jones had to keep grinding all his big set pieces to a halt so that he could shake a little novelty toy to see what he had to do next? But a horror? Fantastic. I already know exactly how this film will go. Two boys find a Magic 8 Ball in a secondhand store. The owner tries to warn them off buying it, because it\u2019s been said that this Magic 8 Ball contains the spirit of the man who invented the Magic 8 Ball, and his dying wish was to wreak a terrible revenge on a world that forgot his name. But the boys buy it anyway, and are horrified to learn that the haunted Magic 8 Ball actively encourages them to act on their worst impulses. Should they eat their vegetables? \u201cMy reply is no.\u201d Should they break into the abandoned hospital at midnight? \u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d Should they perform a blood sacrifice on a kidnapped toddler to appease the dark lord Satan? \u201cIt is certain.\u201d Their gruesome hellride escalates and escalates against their will until \u2013 oh, actually, wait, it\u2019s just a toy, isn\u2019t it? The boys could just throw it in a river or something, couldn\u2019t they? Yeah, never mind, this will be a bad film as well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
