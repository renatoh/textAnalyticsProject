The odd turkey aside (I'm keeping mum not out of respect for their lofty reputations, but because I don't wish to spoil the fun of finding them for yourself), this is a triumph. Smith's beautifully simple brief to the authors was to \"make somebody up\". The collection delights in the traditional: it is impossible to read Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn's \"Donal Webster\" and not fall in love with straightforward fiction all over again. There's also the non-traditional: Daniel Clowes's graphic story about internet movie critics versus \"the print guys\" had me flailing round frantically for someone with whom to share its brilliance. Miranda July is, on this occasion, the right side of kooky, but the revelation for me was Edwidge Danticat's effortlessly cool prose, keeping in check all manner of pain and feeling. Also, what fun have a literary anthology that looks so unapologetically cool. Young people will be buying copies next."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
