Lovin\u2019s a risk. Livin\u2019s a risk. Tonight, I\u2019ll take my chance.\u201d And take it Captain Henshall did. The suspense, the horror. After the humour of last week\u2019s episode this was true drama and all the more excellent for it. It even went a bit Sherlock with ghostly flashbacks and flash-forwards reflecting Ross\u2019s tortured mind. What a treat. Heave, heave! Hurry to Nampara cove! Oh the tears that have fallen. This was a brilliant, action-packed episode. Once again Ross insisted on invading France single-handedly even though it didn\u2019t work at all last time. This time he had a handful of Cornishmen for company, plus the man with the hook hand who, it turns out, speaks rather fine French. Bravo, Hook Man. Ross also had a rubbish map drawn by a five-year-old with minimal knowledge of northern Brittany. Still, they managed to elbow their way in. As soon as they got there, Dwight wanted them to leave. \u201cMake haste and come with us.\u201d No. Dwight has gone mad! His giant beard has sent him bonkers and he won\u2019t allow himself to be freed. But no, it can be done. Heavens, Ross may be too old for this escapade and so am I. I thought I was going to have a cardiac arrest from all the gunfire. And yet it was worth it. \u201cDo you feel strong enough for a small surprise?\u201d Kisses without end all round. Thank goodness Dr Enys had come to his senses; he seemed to have forgotten Caroline for a moment there. \u201cIn truth there is someone. I doubt I\u2019ll ever see her again.\u201d Who knows if things will work out between them now his face has become so scabby? Miss Penvenen was the secret, resilient star of all this. \u201cI admire Caroline\u2019s optimism ... War is never simple. Nor human nature.\u201d It\u2019s excellent to see Gabriella Wilde given more to do. (And to those complaining below the line that \u201cshe is more than a Sindy doll.\u201d Yes, we have always known that. She merely acquired her name by virtue of her uncanny resemblance to the Sindy doll which cannot be disputed.) The party scenes were marvellously intercut with the prison rescue, underscoring the twin purposes of our two rivals, George and Ross. \u201cPresence at these events confirms one\u2019s status in society\u201d is George\u2019s motto. \u201cThe invasion of France regardless of your chances of success\u201d is Ross\u2019s. Meanwhile love blossomed among the toads at Trenwith as Aunt Agatha turned the tarot cards. \u201cHe called to bring some toads. He\u2019s very fond of Geoffrey Charles.\u201d But Aunt Agatha is right \u2013 Evil George would destroy Drake. And no one wants that to happen for Aunt Agatha\u2019s 100th birthday. Beautifully acted here by Ellise Chappell (Morwenna) and Harry Richardson (Drake). \u201cShe don\u2019t care for me and she never did. I\u2019ve no wish to go on in this world.\u201d Wise words from Demelza \u2013 until Drake decided to find rather too much purpose and almost ended up dead. The best cameo of the episode? It can only be one man. Can we start a Mr Whitworth fan club? I love his plumminess, his shiny face and how he says Miss Chynoweth as if he were ordering champagne. \u201cWould you prefer Oxford or Bath for our honeymoon?\u201d I\u2019ll go anywhere you take me, Mr Whitworth, as long as you keep your waistcoat. Meanwhile, the singing at the end was a wonderful advert for the Poldark CD, coming to a Christmas list near you. Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor For the purposes of this section I count everyone apart from Aidan Turner as a supporting actor, so let us focus our attentions on the heinous genius that is Evil George (Jack Farthing). He was in full-on dastardly laugh mode here: \u201cOur mission is plain: to thoroughly discredit Ross Poldark and position me in his stead.\u201d Mwa-ha-ha. It\u2019s hardly a new mission for you, Evil George. Never mind Drake\u2019s life purpose, this is yours. \u201cIs that the kind of madman we want representing us in parliament?\u201d George\u2019s face was a picture. Demelza was not going to let him have his moment. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll ever grow up?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, George, will you?\u201d I can\u2019t wait to see what transpires with the ill-fated Valentine. \u201cMy son has rickets? He is not some commoner\u2019s child raised on gin.\u201d No, but Elizabeth is still on the laudanum. Classic Poldark lines \u201cOur friendship has gone beyond the bounds of common acquaintance.\u201d Poor Morwenna. \u201cThis is the ground plan. It is a series of buildings set in extensive grounds.\u201d Yes Ross, that is what a ground plan is. Well done. \u201cExcuse me. I promised Lord Falmouth the allemande.\u201d Best line of the episode. \u201c\u2018Tis made already. Old Prudie see \u2018em right.\u201d Go, Nurse Prudie! Regulation reverse sexism bare chest moment Last week I missed a glimpse of Horace the pug, so it may be that this week I missed some chest action. But I\u2019m fairly sure there wasn\u2019t any. Instead, we were treated to a gruesome closeup of a bloody wound. That\u2019s no fun. Bring back the bare chests, please. Next week ... Geoffrey Charles is off to Harrow. Evil George is setting a trap for Drake and Ross. Dr Enys has lost his marbles. And Morwenna refuses to submit to Mr Whitworth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
