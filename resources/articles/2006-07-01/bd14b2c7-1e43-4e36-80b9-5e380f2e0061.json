If David Walliams ever murders someone (possibly one of the fans who follow him around in frocks with funny voices), I will be happy to give him a glowing character reference in court. In Little Britain's Big Swim (BBC1) he swam the channel for Sport Relief, to keep an Ethiopian orphanage afloat. Greg Whyte, his trainer, said doubtfully that he was pretty fit - for a comedian. He had never swum further than a mile in his life and he would have to swim 21. The first time he jumped into ice-cold water, I thought he was fooling around but he was hyperventilating. Not clowning but drowning. When Captain Webb swam the channel in 1875, the Mayor of Dover said, \"I make bold as to say\" - they knew how to make a speech, those men with big moustaches - \"that I do not believe that in the future history of the world any such feat will be performed by anybody else.\" It took Webb more than 21 hours. Walliams did it in 10 hours 30 minutes. He said, \"Channel swimmers never looked to me like natural athletes. They were in some ways misfits and loners. I suppose I identified with them. I was overweight at school and never really good at sport. Swimming was one thing I could do.\" In fact, the way Jayne Torvill only looked beautiful on ice, Walliams looks wonderful in water. Channel swimming threw incidental, accidental sidelights on being a comedian. He used exactly the same words for both. Amazing adventure ... scary ... terrible sense of foreboding. \"I'm used to always hiding behind characters. Anything other than being me would be nice. Now people are going to see me cold and tired and in pain. I want to be entertaining and jokey but I'll be really, really cold.\" After the stage, the sea is the loneliest place in the world. \"You really are alone with your thoughts. I try to think about pleasurable things and suppress all negative thoughts. There's something so scary about something coming from under the water and attacking you.\" Your food is offered on the end of a pole. Your drink on the end of a rope. You are out of touch. \"I went through a kind of dream state. My thoughts were delirious, really. My brain felt like it had kind of melted. Weirdly, I even got a sort of anxiety, it was like a paranoia, that people in the boat were talking about me.\" He dragged his hands hard down over his face as if to peel off the memory. On a training swim to the Isle of Wight, Greg Whyte collapsed with hypothermia and was hauled, shuddering, into the boat. Walliams simply said \"Where do I go?\" They pointed and he swam on alone, repeating to himself \"Be a man! Be a man!\" How long since you heard that phrase, and how moved were you to hear it now? Matt Lucas, who did the commentary, said, \"All joking apart, I haven't got what it takes and he has.\" Walliams set out at dawn to swim from Shakespeare Beach to Cap Gris Nez, which has no beach, only boulders. He had literally crawled from England to France and, when he got there, there was no strength left in his arms. He scrabbled at a boulder and slid. He tried to lever himself up with his legs and fell back. He looked dazed. On the boat, Greg Whyte was shouting: \"Get on the rocks! Get on the rocks!\" If he didn't, the swim would be invalid. Then he found a low, sloping shelf and clambered out. He had said something earlier that has a profound sound to it. \"Getting out is the bit I'm looking forward to. But you have to get in to get out.\" I used to live on a raw, new estate. Local folk never failed to say, sighing, \"This used to be all buttercups.\" Emmerdale (ITV1) was like that once. All leaping little lambs and assorted Sugdens. Not any more. It has become a refuge for some of the weirdest acting and wigs on television. The grisly King family have turned Jack Sugden's land into an exciting new development of executive residences (\"Underfloor heating, power showers, dimmer switches in every room\"). Last night was the grand opening. The show home was won by Marlon Dingle in a raffle (fixed, naturally). Eli Dingle, who had studied bricklaying in prison, opined that it was jerry-built. If Eli had studied gas fitting, it might have saved a lot of bother. Jimmy King celebrated by trying to rape his ex-wife, Sadie, in the en suite bedroom. At which point the whole house exploded with a singularly satisfying \"whoomph\" and collapsed into its original components, which appeared to be cardboard and cellophane. For a few seconds nothing was heard but the soft sound of tumbleweed rolling round the Ridings. Under the rubble, Jimmy and Sadie were still alive. A state of affairs briskly resolved when Sadie whacked Jimmy with a rock. The question now agitating the nation is: did she whack him hard enough?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
