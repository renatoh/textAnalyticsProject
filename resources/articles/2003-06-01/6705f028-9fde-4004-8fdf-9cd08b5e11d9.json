AOL Time Warner had been hoping to make \u00a3250m from the sale as part of its ongoing drive to reduce debts of \u00a314.5bn. \"Frankly, we didn't receive an offer that reflected the true value of the asset,\" a company spokeswoman told Reuters. The sale of the division - which includes Little, Brown and Company and Warner Books - drew only one bid, from Frank Pearl and Perseus, the owner of Perseus Books. Bertelsmann, the German owner of Random House, had expressed an interest in Warner books, but decided against a bid, as did Viacom's Simon &amp; Schuster. Other potential suitors who got cold feet were HarperCollins, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, and British book retailer WH Smith. The AOL Time Warner spokesman added: \"[Chief executive] Dick Parsons always says we are not in fire sale mode, and our view is that this is a valuable asset, and we will gladly keep it in the family and continue on our path.\" Other assets the group is looking to sell include its three Atlanta-based sports teams, parts of its music publishing business and its cable systems division. \u00b7 To give MediaGuardian a story email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
