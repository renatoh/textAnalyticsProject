The Ireland coach added that his side are determined to win at the Millennium Stadium and avoid the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Schmidt warned his Ireland side they were lucky and given a reality check in their 16-9 victory over Italy. They conceded 10 penalties and 14 turnovers against the Italians, much to Schmidt\u2019s frustration, and he conceded his team made poor decisions against opponents who pushed them hard throughout. \u201cAround the penalties we know there are some things we have to control better and do better,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were some really poor penalties from us against Italy. If you grab someone in the air in the lineout you know you\u2019re going to be penalised. You can\u2019t do it. If you don\u2019t use your arms \u2013 both of them \u2013 when going in to clean someone out then you are liable for sanction. I think that\u2019s something we weren\u2019t smart enough with and we paid the price.\u201d Schmidt also admitted Ireland\u2019s general play could be improved. He said: \u201cSometimes you get that reality check and it\u2019s then how you react. We were very aware that Italy was going to be tough but we probably didn\u2019t react as well as we should have. \u201cWe were lucky to escape with the points we need to get out of the pool. But I do think the players will heed some of the inaccuracies in our play, and hopefully that leads into a different performance.\u201d Asked whether the win against Italy had taken the edge off the game against France, Schmidt said: \u201cWinning a Test match is a prize worth winning, regardless of where you\u2019re placed in any pool you are in. It is a gilt-edged victory if you can get those two things, a Test victory and that opportunity to maybe play an opponent that is not as difficult.\u201d Schmidt thought France will have an advantage in Sunday\u2019s match because of the extra three days they had to prepare after their victory over Canada. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a 10-day lead-in,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you can build a decent edge in 10 days. We had three and a half hours travelling on Monday, we\u2019ll probably train Wednesday and Friday to try to hone in on what we need to do during those two short windows and try to keep a degree of freshness.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
