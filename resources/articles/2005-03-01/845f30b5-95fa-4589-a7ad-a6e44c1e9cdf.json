But tonight in Turin the Juventus manager faces a monumental gamble: stick with the steady approach that has brought league titles in Italy and Spain, or play three up front and go for broke. In the past week Capello has opted for the latter and been rewarded with victories against Siena and Roma. But at yesterday's press conference he was coy about how his side would line up against Real Madrid after they finished 1-0 down from the first leg at the Bernab\u00e9u. \"We are going to attack, obviously, because we need to score,\" he said. \"But I haven't yet decided whether to go with three strikers. We have to be very careful because Real Madrid are dangerous on the counter-attack.\" If Capello does rebel against his naturally defensive instincts, expect Alessandro Del Piero - a more inconstant than iconic figure these days - to be given another chance to deliver in a free role behind the strikers Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Trezeguet. The absence of the Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved, who has not trained since a clash of heads with Ra\u00fal Bravo in the first leg, has forced Capello's hand if he wants a creative output within his \"trident formation\". Whether he will indeed go with Del Piero, though, is a question which has divided Italy. Del Piero has scored three goals in the last two games, one a wonder strike that recalled those distant days when he bewitched Europe and kept Roberto Baggio out of the national team. But his many critics subscribe to the view of the former Juventus president Gianni Agnelli, who once described Del Piero as \"Godot - because we're always waiting for him\". If Del Piero does perform, Juve may yet repeat their gung-ho victory over Madrid in the European Cup semi-final two years ago. The 3-1 second-leg win ended the Spaniards' dream of winning a fourth European Cup in six seasons and, although Real went on to claim the Spanish title, the failure in Europe cost the then coach Vicente del Bosque his job. One thing is for certain, though: Real will not sit back. Thomas Gravesen will guard the back four, allowing Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, David Beckham and Luis Figo to foray forward. \"We are going to attack,\" Figo said. \"We don't know how to play any other way. But it's not going to be easy and I'm not convinced we are going to score. Nothing in life is definite except death.\" Real's third coach this season, Vanderlei Luxemburgo, faces his toughest examination yet. His side are less spectacular in attack than previously but the pay-off has been an improvement in defence. With the Spanish title gradually slipping out of reach, Real are now focusing their attention firmly on Europe. \"The whole of our season depends on what happens against Juve,\" said their midfielder Guti. \"It will be a failure if we don't get through to the next round but if we score it will be very difficult for them to knock us out.\" Real drew 1-1 at a rejuvenated Valencia on Saturday and although it did little for their title aspirations the draw augured well for their prospects in Turin. Ronaldo scored his first goal in eight games and looked a lot sharper than in recent games. Zidane has recovered from a groin strain and the strikers Ra\u00fal and Michael Owen are back in training after missing the Valencia match because of illness. Juventus (4-3-3, probable): Buffon; Zebina, Thuram, Cannavaro, Zambrotta; Camoranesi, Tacchinardi, Emerson; Del Piero, Ibrahimovic, Trezeguet. Real Madrid (4-4-2, probable): Casillas; Ra\u00fal Bravo, Samuel, Helguera, Roberto Carlos; Beckham, Gravesen, Zidane, Figo; Ra\u00fal, Ronaldo.
