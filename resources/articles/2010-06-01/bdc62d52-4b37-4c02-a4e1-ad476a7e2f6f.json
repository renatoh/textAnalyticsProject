It makes grim reading, but the Play Fair Alliance's Missed the Goal for Workers: The Reality of Soccer Ball Stitches (cleanclothes.org) tells the tale of how workers who handstitch footballs for the international market in India, Pakistan and China are still paid slave wages and forced to work 21-hour days without access to basics like drinking water. And though the sports industry set up the Atlanta Agreement 13 years ago to eliminate child labour in merchandise production, child labour is alive and kicking. Their small hands and nimble fingers are very good at handstitching footballs. They can also be more easily exploited. For similar reasons, women are often preferred by employers \u2013 many are \"homeworkers\", one of the most marginalised producer groups on the planet. A stitcher in Pakistan receives 30 rupees (45p) for a football, and 47 rupees for a Fairtrade football (to Fifa standard), but crucially they also have access to microcredit loans (fairdealtrading.com) A 2008 Play Fair report showed that violations of workers' rights is also still the norm in the sportswear industry. If we turn a blind eye, the London Olympics could easily turn into a sweated event. Go to playfair2012.org to campaign.
