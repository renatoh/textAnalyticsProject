Ian O'Callaghan, 38, who was trapped by DNA evidence, collapsed and wept when told he must serve at least 28 years. O'Callaghan attacked Shirley Leach, 66, at the transport interchange in Bury, Greater Manchester, in January 1994 as she made her way home after visiting her daughter in hospital. He stripped her naked, sexually assaulted her with a bottle and then strangled her. An hour later he returned to cut off one of her breasts with a broken bottle. A copy of The Chronicle Of Murder, a book detailing how a rapist was caught by teeth marks he had left in his victim's breast, was later found at O'Callaghan's home. \"You attacked [Mrs Leach] in a most vicious and violent way,\" said Mr Justice Henriques, passing sentence at Manchester crown court. \"There was manifestly some sexual deviance in your conduct. You left her body in the toilet cubicle before returning and amputating her breast.\" The mutilation could have been intended to destroy scientific evidence but it was also possible O'Callaghan had been \"taking a trophy\". The judge said: \"You had a propensity for violence and sexual misconduct towards women who were strangers to you, as your three previous convictions demonstrate. The victim was vulnerable, she had mental and physical suffering inflicted upon her before death. Being attacked in those circumstances must have been quite horrific.\" Police were unable to find the killer of Mrs Leach, whose husband had died two years earlier, in the months after her murder. The crime was featured on Crimewatch and a newspaper offered a \u00a310,000 reward. The investigation was later reopened by Greater Manchester police as part of a review of cold cases. The jury heard that O'Callaghan, from Bury, was arrested for drink driving last February. His DNA matched that of blood found on the door handle of the toilet cubicle; he had cut his hand in the attack. There was a billion to one chance of the killer being someone else. Arrested this March, he told detectives: \"It's a mistake.\" The court heard that O'Callaghan, a bus driver at the time of the crime, had married and become a father after the murder. He was convicted 10 months later of flashing at two women. When he was 16 he indecently assaulted a woman as she lay in bed, and in October 1992 he was convicted of common assault in Lancaster. Detective Superintendent Bill Roberts, who investigated the murder in 1994, said after the trial: \"This was a horrendously brutal murder ... Shirley was of petite build and wouldn't have been able to put up much of a fight against her attacker. [Her] murder was the only homicide that I ever worked on that remained unsolved when I retired in 2000, and it has played on my mind ever since.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
