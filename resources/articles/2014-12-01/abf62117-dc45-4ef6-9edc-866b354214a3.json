It was Marx, after all, who said history repeats itself as farce, and what could be more farcical than unleashing the likes of Napoleon, Socrates and Genghis Khan on the malls and water parks of 1980s Los Angeles? Then there\u2019s the film\u2019s conclusion: a pair of metal-heads create a utopia, not through doctrine and manifesto, but with guitar heroics and the radical catch cry, \u201cBe excellent to each other\u201d. Alas, we\u2019re not here to discuss Excellent Adventure, but the song which gets it underway: Big Pig\u2019s Breakaway. And, much like the film it features in, Breakaway is about fighting fate and a longing for freedom. \u201cAll my life I wanted to fly, like the birds that you see way up in the sky,\u201d it begins. \u201cMaking circles in the morning sun, flying high in the sky \u2018till the day is done.\u201d It\u2019s some poetic imagery vocalist Sherine Abeyratne delivers, though it\u2019s quickly dealt a blow: \u201cI can\u2019t break away!\u201d comes the booming reality check from the back-up singers. Abeyratne then compares herself to a \u201cchild in his fantasy\u201d who is \u201cpunching holes in the walls of reality\u201d. Yet fantasy is all it is, because, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t have the wings and I wonder why\u201d. The frustrations of growing up is a universal theme, though it\u2019s possible to read the lyrics another way. The original version of Breakaway started life as a late-career obscurity for 60s soul man Chuck Jackson, and it\u2019s not hard to hear a civil rights undertone in his recording. Sung in the female voice \u2013 \u201cStand tall girl, you\u2019re number one\u201d, goes the Big Pig version \u2013 it has another resonance altogether. A different version, a different social bind. The genius of Big Pig though is what they do to the track sonically. There\u2019s a brooding industrial exotica to its take. It\u2019s more a punk-funk mutation than a new-wave makeover. Instead of Hammond and strings, we get eastern-ish synths over a pulsating bass line, and a band of percussionists who\u2019ve been gorging on Japanese taiko drumming. (Nothing brings out their changes like the remix found on the flipside of the 12\u201d cut.) At times, Big Pig had nine drummers. But, unusually for an Australian group of the 80s, never a guitarist. Elsewhere, they push parts of the original to the fore. The nonsensical cries of the chorus, for example. \u201cAh-min-ah, do-ki-do, ah-mah-neh-la,\u201d they chirp in the original and bellow in the remake. It adds another layer of foreignness to Big Pig\u2019s interpretation. (Melbourne producer Michael Ozone took this trick to its extreme in 2012, releasing a song recorded entirely in \u201cnative Ozone\u201d.) The elevated place of the back-up singers brings out another element of the song: the interplay between the protagonist\u2019s hopes and doubts. Every time she pines for freedom, they knock her down. Freud might call them the voice of the superego, forcefully reminding her of society\u2019s rules and expectations. They are so oppressive that, in the end, she herself is singing the same refrain. Excellent Adventure seems to show you can break away and change the course of your destiny. Instead of flunking school, Bill and Ted end poverty, bring peace to Earth and make the planets align. Or perhaps this was written in their stars all along, as it was with Abeyratne and her drums of destiny."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
