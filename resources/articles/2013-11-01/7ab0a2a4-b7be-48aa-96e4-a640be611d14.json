Yet, despite Carrick's absence, David Moyes is giving serious consideration to leaving his \u00a327.5m summer signing, Marouane Fellaini, on the bench due to reservations regarding his current form. The Belgian last featured for United a fortnight ago, when he was replaced during the second half of the 1-1 draw with Southampton; of Carrick Moyes would confirm only that he is a doubt. \"Yes,\" the manager said, before adding that he was \"not sure\" if the midfielder would be available to face Sociedad. Moyes is also insistent that despite the current form of Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge and Luis Su\u00e1rez, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney are the best strikers in the Premier League. \"Wayne and Robin on their day will be a match for any player in the world, never mind just in this country,\" he said. \"So I think when those two are firing, they are the best \u2013 I really do, I see that \u2013 I think they've both incredibly talented, both natural goalscorers, as footballers they both can probably play in several different positions because of their ability.\" Moyes also believes that despite Rooney having been unsettled at the club he could one day be the side's leader. \"I think Wayne has always had an ability to be a captain. I think he's got a love of football which is the biggest thing \u2013 he loves the game, he loves the ball and kicking around, it's natural to him. In the future, yeah, I think he could a future skipper here.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
