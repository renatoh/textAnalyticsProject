Rickie Lambert, Jay Rodriguez and Adam Lallana were at the hub of things as they completed consecutive Premier League away wins for the first time since 2001. However, for all their input it took the centre-back Jos\u00e9 Fonte to seal the points. Although he witnessed his initial 69th-minute header repelled in a splendid double save by the veteran Hull goalkeeper Steve Harper, Fonte's next connection in a penalty-area pinball forced the ball over the line despite the best efforts of Maynor Figueroa to intervene. Lambert lashed in to make sure but Hawk-Eye technology confirmed it was Fonte's goal. It was his second since making headlines for different reasons last month, as the victim of his now ostracised team-mate Dani Osvaldo's head-butt in training. \"That is completely forgotten, in the past, and we can only look forward,\" said the Southampton manager, Mauricio Pochettino. \"The group mentality, the team, is the most important thing, that there's no player above the team and we will always defend the common interest of the group and not a single player.\" The result extended Southampton's unbeaten run to eight matches but the margin could, and should, have been greater. Their domination of both possession and territory against opponents who have been strong on their own patch this season was mightily impressive. Manchester United and Liverpool both trailed early here but the reds of Southampton proved more robust. In fact, but for some uncharacteristically profligate finishing from Lambert they might have wrapped things up inside the quarter-hour. Having scored 23 goals in his 18 months as a Premier League player, the 31-year-old wasted the most presentable of chances to make it an even two dozen in the fifth minute: the elfish Lallana teased in a cross that was only half-cleared but an unmarked Lambert curled wide. While Hull went unpunished for being caught out on that occasion, they were to pay a heavy price when Steven Davis's razor pass nicked the home backline three minutes later. Although the excellent Harper raced out to block, the collision that ensued saw Paul McShane taken off on a stretcher with his leg in a brace. \"He's had x-rays and they revealed no break but the video evidence didn't look great. His ankle was in a horrible position so we fear ligament damage and, as we know, ligaments can sometimes be worse than a break,\" said the Hull manager, Steve Bruce, who confirmed the player has been booked in for scans on Wednesday morning. Following what was a pointless January, Hull eased relegation fears with victory at Sunderland last weekend but this result leaves them only three points above the drop zone. Their January signing Shane Long came close to scoring for the third successive game when his 14th-minute header came back off a post but the visitors created the better chances. However, Rodriguez and Jack Cork both struck the woodwork from distance at the other end and only Harper's endeavours kept the deficit to one. \"For me, if you take away the big boys, Southampton are the best team in this league and once again they made life very difficult for us,\" said Bruce."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
