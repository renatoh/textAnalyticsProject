As the sole survivor from the last successful excursion to these parts, when an unused squad player during the 3-0 win in 2004 under Michael Vaughan, Anderson was asked why subsequent visits have returned just one Test victory from nine matches. West Indies have supposedly been lowly-ranked pushovers during this time and yet twice have left England as red-faced as some of the travelling support, inflicting a 1-0 defeat in 2009 \u2013 the catalyst for the AndrewStrauss/Andy Flower era \u2013 and rising back off the canvas in 2015 to secure a 1-1 draw on this very island. \u201cWhenever we come here you get the feeling that West Indies really want to beat England,\u201d said Anderson, whose own personal highlight in the Caribbean remains passing Ian Botham\u2019s Test wickets record in Antigua four years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s been ingrained in them, especially in the past when England have suffered heavy defeats. You can see it in the players\u2019 eyes when you play against them and that means we\u2019ve got to be on top form to be able to try and challenge them.\u201d At 36 years of age and with the Kensington Oval due to witness his 146th Test, Anderson is not lacking in desire himself, of course. And having left the 3-0 win in Sri Lanka saying he felt \u201ca bit of a spare part\u201d due to conditions, he now has a Dukes ball back in his hand even if the expectation is for flat pitches. \u201cAt least there\u2019s a glimmer of hope for us seam bowlers. We\u2019re hoping for a little bit \u2013 just a little bit \u2013 through the air and it keeps you interested for the game,\u201d said Anderson, having found this to be the case when taking four for 12 from 11 overs in his one warm-up outing. \u201cWe showed in Sri Lanka we can adapt to any conditions. Our batters batted better than they did and our spinners outbowled theirs. We\u2019ve got to do the same again, man for man we\u2019ve got to outplay them. We know we\u2019ve got the talent to do it.\u201d England\u2019s attack leader is unsure at this stage who he will be sharing the new ball with this week. Sam Curran twice performed the role against the President\u2019s XI \u2013 his bustling left-arm swing would certainly benefit from first dibs \u2013 but Stuart Broad will doubtless covet it too, meaning Joe Root has a decision to make. The captain has been here before, of course, having given Chris Woakes the chance in the build-up to last year\u2019s New Zealand series only to revert to the old firm come the main event. Broad impressed the England management with his low ego, team-first attitude when a drinks carrier for two Tests in Sri Lanka and so any possible switch is unlikely to cause grumbling. Broad\u2019s outlook was in part due to an intense focus on his own game. Having reacted to a tough Ashes series last winter by recalibrating his wrist-position, the 32-year-old has also shortened his run-up of late. Anderson, whose frictionless approach to the crease initially inspired the change (along with YouTube videos of Sir Richard Hadlee), is impressed. He said: \u201cSince Australia, I\u2019ve not seen anyone work as hard as he has on their game. It\u2019s a credit to [Broad], he\u2019s put so many hard yards in, not just on his run-up but on his action, trying to swing the ball away again.\u201d The first outing for Broad\u2019s shorter run-up was actually in Colombo, where a couple of drops by Root in the slips cost him an instant return on the hard graft. Six wickets last week \u2013 including a hat-trick of tailenders \u2013 offered more hope that the tinkering will pay off. Anderson added: \u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about the last six yards, building that momentum up to the crease. He still has the same snap and can definitely have the same oomph. I do think the run-up has looked really good here. It might just get another couple of years out of him. Part of him thinks \u2018why have I not done this sooner?\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
