The package imposed by the water regulator includes compensation of \u00a3123m to customers over five years and a \u00a33m fine. The company\u2019s 4.2 million customers will each receive \u00a361 off their bills \u2013 \u00a317 in 2020-21 and \u00a311 in each of the following four years. The Environment Agency said it was continuing to pursue a criminal investigation into Southern Water that began in 2016. \u201cThe environmental aspect of the investigation is ongoing and we expect to commence court proceedings soon.\u201d Ofwat found Southern Water failed to operate a number of sewage treatment works properly, including by making insufficient investment, which led to equipment failures and spills of wastewater. It also found that the company, which operates in Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, manipulated its wastewater sampling process and misreported the performance of several sewage treatment sites. The regulator\u2019s chief executive, Rachel Fletcher, said: \u201cWhat we found in this case is shocking. In all, it shows the company was being run with scant regard for its responsibilities to society and the environment. It was not just the poor operational performance but the coordinated efforts to hide and deceive customers of the fact that are so troubling.\u201d Southern Water said it was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d and added that the costs of the penalty would not be passed on to customers in the form of higher prices. The company is owned by the Greensands consortium of infrastructure investors and pension funds. The chief executive, Ian McAulay, who was appointed in January 2017, said in a statement: \u201cWe are deeply sorry for what has happened. There are no excuses for the failings that occurred between 2010 and 2017 outlined in Ofwat\u2019s report. We have clearly fallen far short of the expectations and trust placed in us by our wastewater customers and the wider communities we serve.\u201d He said on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt is perfectly reasonable to say there was dishonesty. That is incredibly disappointing and not the standard we want to have in this business, and I was brought in to make sure that could not happen again.\u201d He dodged a question about whether there should be criminal sanctions, saying: \u201cThis was a small number of people.\u201d It is understood Southern Water has dismissed several people. McAulay said the company had overhauled its governance, invested \u00a3100m in new IT systems and \u00a326m in wastewater assets, and vowed to invest several billions of pounds over the next five years. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, said: \u201cToday\u2019s eye-watering fines and forced customer rebates demonstrate clearly just how broken our water system is. Despite failures, chronic underinvestment and exorbitant customer bills, many water companies continue to pay out hefty dividends to shareholders.\u201d She said she supported the Environment Agency\u2019s criminal investigation, and reiterated that a Labour government would renationalise water companies. \u201cInstead of ripping off customers and creaming off the profits, Labour will ensure our water companies are run for the benefit of us all by taking them back into public ownership, lowering bills and investing to safeguard our water quality.\u201d Ofwat said the package of penalties and payments was the biggest it had ever imposed, proportionate to the size of the business. It would have been larger had Southern Water not cooperated with its investigation. Matthew Wright, a former chief executive of Southern Water, was paid more than \u00a35m by the company during his time at the helm between 2011 and 2016, when the failings occurred. He is now the UK managing director of the Danish renewable energy firm \u00d8rsted, which is building offshore wind farms in the UK. Last year Thames Water, Britain\u2019s biggest water company, received a \u00a3120m package of penalties from the regulator, including a \u00a365m payment to customers, for its failure to tackle leaks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
