The Met police are asked to investigate, and then assistant commissioner Bob Quick takes charge of the inquiry. 19 November 2008 Junior Home Office official and former Tory council candidate Christopher Galley is arrested in connection with the leaked documents, which were obtained by the Conservative party. He is released on bail. 28 November 2008 Damian Green, then shadow immigration spokesman, is arrested at home in Kent on suspicion of \u201cconspiring to commit misconduct in a public office\u201d and \u201caiding and abetting misconduct in public office\u201d by counter-terrorism police officers in connection with the Home Office leaks. The charges carry a potential life sentence. The then assistant Met commissioner Bob Quick ordered the arrest. Late 2008 Police find \u201cextreme\u201d pornographic material on one of the Commons computers of Damian Green during an inquiry into the leaks. It is not reported at the time. At the time Green was a Conservative MP but he would later become minister for policing, criminal justice and victims and then work and pensions secretary. He was a friend of Theresa May\u2019s at Oxford University and is one of her closest political allies. After managing to form a minority government after the 2017 general election, May appointed him first secretary of state, effectively deputy prime minister. 8 April 2009 Assistant Met commissioner Bob Quick is forced to resign before the leaks inquiry can be completed after he was photographed carrying sensitive anti-terror documents for a meeting in No 10. Quick later suggests he would not have had to resign if his inquiry had not arrested Green. 16 April 2009 Keir Starmer QC, then director of public prosecutions, ends a \u00a35m five-month police investigation into Damian Green and Christopher Galley after concluding there was insufficient evidence to prosecute either man because the information leaked to Green on the government\u2019s immigration policy was not secret and did not affect national security or put lives at risk. 24 April 2009 Home office civil servant Christopher Galley is sacked for leaking information to Damian Green on the grounds of gross professional misconduct. 12 October 2009 Two inquiries into Scotland Yard\u2019s arrest of Damian Green and Christopher Galley conclude the investigation was ill-advised, not proportionate and undermined by procedural flaws in police inquiries. 13 February 2012 Quick submits evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics and the media\u2019s relationship with the police in which he claims he came under pressure to drop the investigation into Green before all the evidence had been examined. Early 2015 Green meets Kate Maltby, a Conservative activist and journalist, in a bar in Waterloo, London after he invites her for a drink. Green, almost 30 years older than Maltby, is an acquaintance of her parents and the pair had met previously. On this occasion, after discussing whether Maltby was interested in a political career and sexual affairs in parliament, she claims Green \u201cmentioned that his own wife was very understanding. I felt a fleeting hand against my knee \u2013 so brief, it was almost deniable.\u201d 1 June 2016 Maltby, having, she says, not been in contact with Green for a year, receives a text relating to an article she had written in the Times the previous day about corsets. It read: \u201cLong time no see. But having admired you in a corset in my favourite tabloid I feel impelled to ask if you are free for a drink anytime?\u201d 1 November 2017 After a flurry of sexual abuse and harassment allegations that began in Hollywood with the revelations about Harvey Weinstein but then spread to other areas, including Westminster, Maltby writes in the Times about her 2015 encounter with Green, claiming: \u201cHe offered me career advice and in the same breath made it clear he was sexually interested.\u201dGreen calls any allegation that he made sexual advances to Maltby \u201cuntrue [and] deeply hurtful\u201d. The same day May orders an investigation by the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, into the claims. 2 November 2017 The cabinet office launches an inquiry into Green\u2019s conduct with Kate Maltby, the second after a similar sleaze probe was launched into Conservative minister Mark Garnier who admitted asking his secretary to buy him sex toys. Sue Gray, the Cabinet Office\u2019s head of propriety and ethics, is appointed to lead the inquiry. Separately, a widely criticised profile of Kate Maltby appears in the Daily Mail, suggesting Maltby\u2019s parents were \u201caghast at what she had done\u201d by accusing Green, which she denies. It said she had a \u201cflair for self-promotion\u201d and was \u201ckeen to make her mark in politics\u201d. The article ends with a quote from a \u201cTory source\u201d, who says \u201cshe might be more careful the next time she\u2019s asked to write a piece trashing a decent man\u201d. 5 November 2017 A report emerges that police found porn on one of Green\u2019s parliamentary computers during an inquiry into government leaks in 2008. The Sunday Times cites a statement prepared by Bob Quick. The paper said that Quick had intended to report the discovery of pornographic material to the parliamentary authorities, but was forced to quit his job before the leaks inquiry was completed. At the time, Quick accused Tories of trying to undermine his investigation into Green by \u201cacting in a wholly corrupt way\u201d although he later retracted the accusation. Strongly denying the pornography allegations last month, Green called Quick a \u201ctainted and untrustworthy source\u201d. Quick\u2019s draft statement, which was not reported to the leak inquiry, read: \u201cNo criminal offences were involved, but it was recognised that if similar circumstances pertained to a public servant, such as a member of a police force, this could result in gross misconduct proceedings and dismissal.\u201d The cabinet office inquiry is broadened to include claims made about Green and pornography. 1 December 2017 Neil Lewis, a detective who examined Green\u2019s computer, says it contained thousands of pornographic images. The officer, who worked for Quick and specialised in examining digital devices for evidence, said: \u201cIt was ridiculous to suggest anybody else could have done it.\u201d Green repeated his denial. 5 December 2017 Quick, the former Met police assistant commissioner, demands that Green retract the \u201cdeeply hurtful allegations\u201d that he lied about pornography on the MP\u2019s personal computer, threatening legal action if he failed to do so. 12 December 2017 The Cabinet Office inquiry into the conduct of Green is expanded to examine whether allies of the first secretary of state influenced the Daily Mail profile about Kate Maltby. 20 December 2017 Damian Green resigns as first secretary of state. Prime minister Theresa May: \u201cI asked you to resign ... and I have gratefully accepted your resignation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
