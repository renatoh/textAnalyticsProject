Lewis Pugh, who in his role raises awareness about the state of the world\u2019s oceans, has worked with three of the rivals in the Tory leadership race \u2013 Michael Gove as environment secretary and both Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson as foreign secretaries \u2013 but highlighted Johnson\u2019s lack of action. \u201cUnfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to get Boris to protect Georgia and the Sandwich Islands. Just one signature and he could have created a protected area over a million square kilometres, but he didn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. The British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands is home to one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world. It featured in David Attenborough\u2019s Blue Planet II, when albatross chicks are seen eating plastic. Throughout Johnson\u2019s time as foreign secretary, there was mounting pressure for him to make the territory a fully protected marine area, with cross-party support from 285 MPs to do so. The protection of the area was finally announced in December 2018. Johnson has tried to present himself as a modern green candidate with an impressive record on climate issues as London mayor. During his leadership launch on Wednesday, Johnson congratulated the UK for being \u201cworld leaders in clean power and environmental protection\u201d. But Pugh said he was angered to see a column in the Daily Telegraph by Johnson calling for the area to be protected shortly after he\u2019d left office. \u201cHe was foreign secretary for a two year period. He had every opportunity to do that while he was in power,\u201d said Pugh. Pugh swam in the South Georgian waters \u2013 which are under British jurisdiction \u2013 to highlight the importance of making it a fully protected marine area. But he was frustrated to find that even this wasn\u2019t enough to get Johnson on side. He said: \u201cI went to the extent of even swimming down there, in the dangerous waters, to try to get him to understand how important it was and he still wouldn\u2019t meet me.\u201d Rising sea-levels and the destruction of underwater habitats are key concerns in the fight against the climate crisis, with over 90% of the the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions absorbed by the seas. Pugh did, however, have kind words for Gove, who he worked with during his stint as environment secretary. \u201cMichael is exceptional. You go to a meeting with him and he just listens. He writes loads of notes and you see loads of emails the next day. He\u2019s really good at detail.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
