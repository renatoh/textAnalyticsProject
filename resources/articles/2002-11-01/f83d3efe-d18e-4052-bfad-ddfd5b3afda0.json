Our aim is to ensure that, as far as possible, witnesses are supported, relaxed, comfortable and informed. Most people have never been in court before and the experience can be stressful and overwhelming. We provide practical and emotional support to them on the day of the trial and, if appropriate, in advance. Support is offered to victims, prosecution and defence witnesses and to anyone accompanying them such as family and friends. However, most of our work is with victims of crime and prosecution witnesses. We offer advance visits to court and we encourage these pre-trial visits as witnesses usually find them helpful. During the visit we can show the witness an empty courtroom. I encourage witnesses to stand in the witness box and to walk around the courtroom, I think that this can take away some of the mystique of the place. We also explain who sits where and what their role is. Witnesses can also go into the public gallery and observe a trial, although a lot of witnesses find this quite daunting and don't want to see a trial in progress. Coming face to face with the defendant and their supporters is often one of the biggest causes of concern for a witness. We explain that there are separate waiting rooms so they don't have to wait in the same area as the defendant before going into the courtroom. We also explain what happens on the day of the trial. For example, where the witness goes when they first arrive and that a Witness Service worker will be there to support them. We can also answer any queries and give general information on court proceedings. Our service's staff are all volunteers trained to carry out a court code of practice. The Witness Service is funded by the Home Office and comes under the auspices of the charity Victim Support. My position as coordinator is a paid one. On the day of the trial we meet the witnesses, inform the ushers, police and Crown Prosecution Service that they've arrived, and explain some of the court jargon as and when necessary. We listen to and empathise with any concerns a witness may have. All our workers are trained for this; however, we don't offer counselling. We will accompany the witness into court if required and sit beside or behind the witness box whilst they are giving evidence. We are not allowed to intervene during proceedings or prompt the witness. We are there to provide the witness with someone they feel they can trust. After the witness has given evidence we can offer support and reassurance. We do not at any time discuss the evidence, offer any legal advice or give an opinion on the likely outcome of the case. On the more specific subject of child protection, we support children who give evidence in court cases. A child may be the victim of, or witness to, sexual or mental abuse, physical violence or intimidation. For these young people, the Witness Service can provide young witness packs to help familiarise them with the court process. It includes booklets aimed at parents and carers of young witnesses and a range of booklets and materials for use by different ages groups from five to 17. The pack is produced by the NSPCC and paid for and provided to the Witness Service by the police child protection units. Besides the overall service already outlined which is available to all witnesses, there are special measures available to certain categories of witnesses at a trial, subject to the approval of the court. One of the categories is witnesses who are under 17. The measures are intended to assist vulnerable witnesses to give their best evidence in the least stressful environment. They include the use of screens, which can be put around the witness box to shield the witness from the sight of the defendant but not from the bench or counsel. They are easy to use and both witness and defendant remain present in the courtroom. Another measure that can be used in crown courts is for judges and barristers to remove their wigs and gowns, to reduce the intimidating formality of the proceedings. Live CCTV links - widely used in crown courts for some time - are gradually becoming available in magistrates' courts. Three of the six magistrates' courts in Hertfordshire now have a CCTV link. The link allows children to sit in a separate room in the courthouse and give their evidence via live CCTV to the courtroom where the bench and counsel can see the witness on a monitor and the witness can see the person talking to them on their own monitor. A Witness Service volunteer accompanies the child into the CCTV link room. Parents and carers should not be present for several reasons. For example, they may become upset by the evidence and inhibit the child from giving their best evidence or they may prompt or try to influence the child. All of the special measures have the advantage of taking into account the wellbeing of the witness and trying to relieve some of the stress of appearing in court. However, there are some disadvantages. Some young witnesses may feel that they prefer the judge and counsel to wear their wigs and gowns so that the trial is a formal rather than casual procedure and gives them a sense that the process is being taken seriously. The witness may object to the use of screens on the grounds that the defendant may think that they are frightened or intimidated. Similarly, giving evidence via a CCTV link may also seem to a witness to be an unreal experience and they may feel that they are not really part of the trial. All of the measures, I have to stress, are at the discretion and approval of the court and are not automatically available to any witness, including children. Equally, if children do not want to take advantage of the special measures (screens, removal of wigs, CCTV testimony) they are not forced to, and can give their evidence in open court in the usual way. The authorities try to take the views of the witness into account. Consultation and liaison between the police, the CPS and court staff, including the Witness Service before the trial date and also on the day of the trial tries to ease the process as much as possible for people testifying. In recent years we've seen a move toward a concern for witness care, and changes in practice and legislation have greatly improved the conditions under which victims and witnesses go to court to give evidence. Giving evidence is never going to be easy but I feel that we in the Witness Service provide a worthwhile and useful service. Over the last few years my experience is also that the criminal justice agencies have been working more closely in partnership which can only be a positive step in the right direction. - Linda Wilding has a BA in Social Science and an MA in Criminology.
