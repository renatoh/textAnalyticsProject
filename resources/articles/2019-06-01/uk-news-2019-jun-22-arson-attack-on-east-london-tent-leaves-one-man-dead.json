One man in his 40s died and a second man of a similar age was left in a critical condition after the makeshift shelter where they were living in east London was allegedly set on fire late on Tuesday. The dead man suffered burns to nearly all of his body, while the second victim remains in an induced coma in hospital and may die from his injuries, police said. Detectives have called for help in finding out the identities of the victims. \u201cThis was a horrific incident which has caused one man to lose his life, and may claim the life of another,\u201d DCI Paul Considine said. \u201cWe really need to hear from anyone who knows or think they may know either or both of these men to help us with our investigation. I am particularly appealing to the east European community to come forward, as we think both men may be of Romanian origin. \u201cWe believe that the deceased man may have been called Majea or Manea, but we do not know if this is a first name, surname or even a correct name, while the second man in hospital in Essex might be called Pedro, or Petra, but again we can\u2019t be sure this is right.\u201d Considine urged anyone with any relevant information, however insignificant, to contact police. Two men have been charged with murder, attempted murder and arson with intent to endanger life in connection with the incident. Police, paramedics and firefighters were called to reports of a blaze on land next to the southbound carriageway of the A406 at about 11.45pm on Tuesday. Scotland Yard said a small number of people were living at the site and the man with almost 100% burns was found nearby. He was taken to the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel, but died within hours of arrival. The second victim had managed to make it to the roadside and was taken to a specialist burns unit at Broomfield hospital in Essex, where he remains in intensive care. Police have been told the men may have worked as casual labourers, and detectives asked for those who may have employed them to get in touch. One of the suspects, a 37-year-old man, is due to appear before Barkingside magistrates court on Saturday, while a 51-year-old suspect appeared at the same court on Friday. Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or the incident line number, 020 8345 3865 quoting either Operation Rochefort or 9090/18JUN."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
