The Labour MP would consider extending the current regime for under-18s to all those under 21, which could see more young adults given community orders, including intensive monitoring, mandatory work and curfews instead of short jail sentences. He said Labour would look at the idea following a report by the Institute of Public Policy Reform (IPPR), which recommends a \"new community sentence specifically tailored to the 18\u201320 age group, which would provide a more effective alternative to short prison sentences\". Under the proposals, the Youth Justice Board would replace the work of the probation service for that age group, with the goal of preventing potential offenders from turning to crime and intensively helping those who have been caught. Locally run youth offending teams would take on the additional responsibility of 18-to-20-year-olds, although this age group would not be eligible to go into young offenders' institutions. On top of those potential reforms, Labour will also consider handing the youth justice budget down to local level and may be subject to pilots after 2015. Labour sources stressed that the ideas would not downplay serious crimes, or redefine those aged 18 to 20 as \"youths\" and would only be carried out if they are found to be definitely \"workable and affordable\". However, Khan will make it clear in a speech to the Reform thinktank that he believes \"this is an idea whose time has come\". \"If we can re-create even a fraction of the success of the youth justice system, we'd cut crime, cut prison numbers and save the taxpayer money,\" he will say. \"This is a sensible step, building on what works, extending it to a decent chunk of the most prolific offenders. And, what's more, working with another important group of first-time and repeat offenders.\" The youth justice system, which currently only deals with those aged up to 18, has seen steep falls in youth crime and the numbers behind bars. However, the peak age for offending is 19, and young adults are the group with the highest reoffending rates. Joyce Moseley, chairman of the Transition to Adulthood Alliance, said: \"This would mean fewer victims of crime in the future, better outcomes for young people, and big savings to the taxpayer.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
