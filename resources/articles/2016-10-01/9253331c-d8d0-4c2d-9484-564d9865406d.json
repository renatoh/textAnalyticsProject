The FBI had announced in July that its investigation into the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s private email server had concluded with a recommendation of no criminal charges in the matter, although James Comey, the FBI\u2019s director, criticised Clinton as \u201ccareless\u201d. But in a letter sent to members of Congress on Friday, Comey said new emails had been discovered in an \u201cunrelated\u201d case. \u201cIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,\u201d Comey wrote. \u201cI am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\u201d Comey added: \u201cAlthough the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and I cannot predict how long it will take to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.\u201d At an evening press conference in Des Moines, Iowa, Clinton briefly addressed the letter to reporters. \u201cThe American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,\u201d she said. \u201cThe director himself has said he doesn\u2019t know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July,\u201d she concluded, alluding to Comey\u2019s finding of \u201cextremely careless\u201d email practices but no criminal wrongdoing. Her rival, Donald Trump, also remarked on the letter, telling rallygoers: \u201cThe system might not be as rigged as I thought.\u201d A US security source firmly ruled out that the \u201cunrelated case\u201d Comey referred to in his letter was the investigation into the hacking of the Democratic National Committee earlier this year. US intelligence officials have blamed Russia for hacking the DNC and releasing its internal communications online. The source, who would not speak on the record, said neither that inquiry nor its adjuncts were related to the new investigative developments related to Clinton. Nor is the recent criminal investigation into a National Security Agency contractor accused of hoarding highly classified intelligence data. Later the Associated Press, citing an unnamed official, claimed the newly discovered emails \u201cdid not come from her private server\u201d. Several outlets have reported that the emails came from devices seized from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner, in connection to an investigation of inappropriate text messages that Weiner sent to an underage girl. The letter from Comey comes 11 days before the presidential election and nearly four months after the FBI director announced the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton for what it dubbed \u201cextremely careless\u201d use of a private email server while secretary of state. The FBI director said then: \u201cAlthough there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes \u2026 our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\u201d Clinton was campaigning in Iowa. It was not immediately clear if she would address the matter publicly and she ignored shouted questions from reporters waiting on the airport tarmac. She did not raise the issue after taking the stage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sticking with her routine stump speech. In Des Moines, she referred to the news only obliquely, saying: \u201cWe have got to keep our foot on the gas. Donald Trump says he can still win and he is right. You know this has been such an unusual election. I don\u2019t take any place, anyone or anything for granted. I am going to work as hard as I can until the end.\u201d Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, called on Comey to \u201cimmediately provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter he sent to eight Republican committee chairmen\u201d. \u201cAlready, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is \u2018reopening\u2019 an investigation, but Comey\u2019s words do not match that characterization,\u201d he said. \u201cDirector Comey\u2019s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant.\u201d He added that he was \u201cconfident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July\u201d. Clinton\u2019s running mate, Virginia senator Tim Kaine, told reporters he had to \u201cread a little more\u201d when asked about the matter on the campaign trail in Florida. The Dow Jones fell more than 100 points after the release of Comey\u2019s letter. The controversy over Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while at the state department has loomed over her candidacy since before she even announced her intent to seek the White House in April. Clinton\u2019s use of a \u201chomebrew\u201d email server left emails containing classified information potentially vulnerable to foreign hackers, and her deletion of 33,000 emails deemed personal has been a major campaign issue. Trump took the stage to a cheering crowd in New Hampshire shortly after the news broke. \u201cThey are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America,\u201d the Republican nominee said to loud chants of \u201clock her up\u201d. He continued to assail his rival in deeply personal terms. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before \u2013 we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office,\u201d Trump said. Trump, who has long claimed that the former secretary of state was only allowed to run for the White House because of a \u201crigged system\u201d, added: \u201cI have great respect for the fact that the FBI and Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.\u201d Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, also pounced on the news while campaigning in Pennsylvania \u2013 bringing the crowd to its feet when informing supporters of the FBI\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe commend the FBI for having the courage to reopen this case, because no one is above the law,\u201d Pence said. The Republican vice-presidential nominee also called on the FBI to make public all emails pertinent to the investigation. In a statement, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, condemned Clinton\u2019s behavior. \u201cYet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame. She was entrusted with some of our nation\u2019s most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information.\u201d Some lawmakers questioned the timing of the announcement, with less than two weeks remaining until the election. \u201cWhy is FBI doing this just 11 days before the election?\u201d John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, tweeted. \u201cWhy would FBI reopen Hillary investigation unless there is evidence of more than \u2018extreme carelessness\u2019 in handling classified information?\u201d California senator Dianne Feinstein, a Clinton ally and the senior Democrat on the intelligence committee, proclaimed herself \u201cshocked\u201d by Comey\u2019s behavior. Feinstein had praised Comey in July for a \u201cthorough, objective review\u201d, after the FBI director declined to recommend an indictment over Clinton\u2019s private email service. Comey had \u201cplayed right into the political campaign of Donald Trump,\u201d Feinstein said, adding that his departure from the FBI\u2019s \u201chistory of extreme caution near Election Day\u201d was \u201cappalling\u201d. Democrats also complained in private that Comey\u2019s letter was vague and raised more questions than it answered. The Republican National Committee was quick to cast the FBI\u2019s announcement as a reopening of the investigation into whether Clinton engaged in criminal behavior \u2013 even though the nature of the new inquiry remained unclear. \u201cThe FBI\u2019s decision to reopen their criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret email server just 11 days before the election shows how serious this discovery must be,\u201d the RNC chairman, Reince Priebus, said in a statement. \u201cThis stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why, and whether they show intent to violate the law. \u201cWhat\u2019s indisputable is that Hillary Clinton jeopardized classified information on thousands of occasions in her reckless attempt to hide pay-to-play corruption at her State Department,\u201d he added. \u201cThis alone should be disqualifying for anyone seeking the presidency, a job that is supposed to begin each morning with a top secret intelligence briefing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
