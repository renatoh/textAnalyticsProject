The comedian and TV presenter, who hosts Landscape Artist of the Year on Sky Arts alongside the broadcaster and Labour peer Joan Bakewell, is a regular visitor to the opera. The West Bromwich-born presenter has a Midlands accent and presented programmes including Fantasy Football, Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned and Room 101. \u201cPeople ask me: \u2018Why are you doing an art show?\u2019 And that\u2019s about social class,\u201d Skinner told the Radio Times. \u201cI did Sunday Brunch with a posh lad from Made in Chelsea and he said: \u2018I\u2019m a bit hungover because I was at an art fair all night.\u2019 Nobody said: \u2018You seem a bit of an idiot, what are you doing at an art fair?\u2019 He wasn\u2019t obvious art fair material but he had the right accent.\u201d Skinner\u2019s interest in art has led him to host tours of the National Gallery in London and make a film about performance art for the Tate. He and Bakewell have become \u201copera buddies\u201d and \u201cproperly good friends\u201d through three series of Landscape Artist of the Year, which returns next week. \u201cI live for that moment when she says: \u2018You have four Rs [hours],\u2019\u201d he said of her accent. Skinner said during their trips to the opera \u201cwe take it in turns to pick what to see. I went before Joan took me too, mainly because I bought a flat in Covent Garden and I thought \u2018Well, it\u2019s so close\u2019. \u201cI also had a friend who worked at the Royal Opera House so she used to get me tickets for dress rehearsals.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
