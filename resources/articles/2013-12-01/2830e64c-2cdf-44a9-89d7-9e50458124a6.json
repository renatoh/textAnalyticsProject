He is not thinking about Europe to the extent that he has spent time formulating the radical change he wants to the domestic football schedule to benefit teams playing in the Europa League. Newcastle's upward mobility courtesy of a four-match winning run, their best for 19 months, comes with the caveat that any repeat of their lofty finish of 2011-12 brings with it qualification for the continent's second-tier competition. Their participation last season almost had dire consequences for their continued presence in the Premier League, such was their fall from grace as they tumbled from fifth top to fifth bottom in 12 turbulent months. The blame for such an ignominious reversal of fortunes was laid squarely at the door of their draining European travails, with injuries and fatigue blamed on the regular and uniquely unforgiving Thursday-Sunday turn-around. Pardew wants the authorities to look into the situation, suggesting his own solution to what he sees as a major obstacle to clubs attempting to flourish on those two fronts. \"The Europa League needs to change for clubs in the Premier League,\" he said. \"League games need to go to Monday night. If they are going to insist we play Thursday, then we have to play the subsequent Premier League game on a Monday. That would be fair. If teams play in the Champions League on a Wednesday, they play on a Sunday. That's fair and gives you just enough time but Thursday to Sunday is not fair.\" Newcastle probably have more chance of qualifying for Europe than they do of the rule-makers listening to the musings of Pardew. The Newcastle manager saw his side's goals arrive in each half, from Yoan Gouffran, with a close-range header after a mistake by Boaz Myhill, and Moussa Sissoko, who ended a nine-month hiatus from the scoresheet with a sumptuous long-range effort. The pair were among a group brought in during the January transfer window, when Newcastle's concerns were at the opposite end of the table. Pardew feels his large influx of French players have been the subject of unfair criticism during what has been at times a difficult acclimatisation process, one which he feels is being successfully negotiated by the club's significant cross-Channel contingent. \"This is where I hoped we'd get to when I joined,\" Sissoko said. \"Last season was a really difficult time for the club but when we arrived we had a mission to make sure we got the points on the board to stay up. It was hard but we did it. \"Now, we've had a great pre-season under our belt and we're putting in some excellent performances. We don't want to see the same thing happen as last season. We're well aware that things can change very quickly, but we're confident we can stay in the top 10 or even higher with the squad that we have.\" The visitors were level for only four minutes courtesy of an uncompromising finish from Chris Brunt, which found the net from a narrow angle. Victor Anichebe's late effort could have sealed a point but the substitute was wasteful with his header. A swift return to action against Manchester City on Wednesday promises little respite but James Morrison was insistent that Albion can pose problems for their wealthy visitors \"We seem to play better against the better sides,\" the Scotland midfielder said. He added: \"That sounds strange, because over the years we've struggled against the top teams, but this season it hasn't been so much the case.\" Man of the match Moussa Sissoko (Newcastle United)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
