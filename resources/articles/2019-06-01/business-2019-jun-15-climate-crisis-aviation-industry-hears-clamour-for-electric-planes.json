The scale of the challenge is considerable. The target for net zero carbon emissions by 2050, recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and embraced by the UK this week, coincides with the expectation that the number of flights will double in the next 20 years. Aviation accounts for about 2% of total greenhouse gas emissions. But that share is expected to rise as demand grows in poorer countries to match developed nations such as the UK, where flying contributed 7% to overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2017. The aviation industry has been an emissions laggard compared with the car industry or power generation, but improvements in the power-to-weight ratio of batteries mean some forms of sustainable aviation for shorter trips may finally be coming into view. The industry will move towards hybrid and electric engines for regional travel (below 1,000 miles) much quicker than many think, according to a report published this week by analysts at investment bank UBS. They predict annual demand for about 550 hybrid planes, using a mixture of fossil fuel and electric power, between 2028 and 2040. This would create a $178bn (\u00a3140bn) industry over that time period. The Seattle-based electric engine company MagniX will be at the show and is planning its first test flight in November with a retrofitted seaplane. Its engines will also power the nine-seater Alice plane currently being made by Eviation, an Israeli startup targeting commercial deliveries in 2022. \u201cThe only option is going to be electric propulsion,\u201d said Roei Ganzarski, MagniX\u2019s chief executive. His company will focus on powering flights of under 900 miles, which accounted for about 45% of trips in 2018. For traditional manufacturers, investments in electric technology are seen as vital for long-term survival. European manufacturer Airbus, which will have a big presence at Paris and vies with America\u2019s Boeing as the largest planemaker, is investing hundreds of millions of euros in electric technology \u2013 although it still has an order backlog of about nine years of carbon-emitting planes. Glenn Llewellyn, general manager for electrification at Airbus, said the company saw \u201creducing our CO2 emissions as a necessity\u201d. Those who don\u2019t invest heavily could be left behind as carbon emissions regulations become stricter, he added. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is disruptive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of technology disruption and societal expectations. There\u2019s huge progress. It\u2019s not enough [yet], it\u2019s not sufficient for our ambitions, but the technology is progressing.\u201d Airbus is building a hybrid-electric plane in partnership with the UK\u2019s Rolls-Royce, Germany\u2019s Siemens and Cranfield University, with the first flight due in 2021. However, Llewellyn said the technology would not be viable in larger commercial aircraft until the 2030s at least. Regulatory pressure is building as well. Europe\u2019s regulator, the European Aviation Safety Agency, plans to start labelling aircraft based on their carbon emissions, while Sweden and Norway aim to have all short-haul flights electrically powered by 2040. Manufacturers also see other attractions from electric engines. Multiple companies are racing to produce the first air taxis for cities, with much quieter electric propulsion systems and the option of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). Airbus-backed Vahana, German startup Lilium and US firm Bell Helicopter \u2013 partnered with ride-hailing firm Uber \u2013 are among the companies trying to bring air taxis to market, targeting congested journeys such as connections from airports in cities such as New York. Meanwhile Boeing, Airbus\u2019s fierce rival, is backing Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area startup that has plans to bring a small hybrid-electric commuter aircraft to market in the early 2020s, and Aurora Flight Sciences, which is also targeting air taxis. Yet for the larger commercial aircraft which are responsible for the bulk of global emissions, a change from carbon-emitting propulsion systems is still 20 years away, according to Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the UK aerospace group. Emissions from aviation will have to fall less slowly than in other parts of the economy because of the \u201cfundamental reality\u201d of increasing demand and a lack of alternatives, he said. He said: \u201cAs an industry we accept our responsibility an are working to achieve more sustainable products [\u2026] whilst also recognising that people want to travel.\u201d The industry\u2019s main contributions to shorter-term reductions in emissions will come through improvements such as tweaks to existing engine technology and reductions in plane weight, Everitt said. Environmental campaigners argue that the urgency of the climate crisis means that the promising but under-developed technologies to be showcased in Paris are less important than short-term measures such as a carbon tax or producing substitute fuels. \u201cWe have a pretty small timeframe to cut emissions,\u201d said Andrew Murphy, aviation manager at Transport &amp; Environment, a Brussels-based campaign group. \u201cEither you don\u2019t fly or you replace the fuel with something less carbon-intensive than kerosene.\u201d Those alternatives could include advanced biofuels \u2013 those that do not contribute towards deforestation \u2013 and \u201celectrofuels\u201d such as synthetic kerosene, which are produced from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere using energy from renewable sources. Alternative fuel sources could be then substituted relatively easily for kerosene \u2013 reducing the need for radical adjustment. \u201cThe aviation industry is a conservative industry,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t like changing the way that it operates.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
