Harrison's appointment was one of several made by the Rugby Football League today for the second staging of the six-team tournament. He will be assisted by Wigan caretaker coach Denis Betts. Harrison takes over from Hull assistant boss John Kear, who had held the post since the 2000 World Cup but now moves into the role of the tournament's coaching consultant. Kear will be available for coaching consultation for all nations participating in the tournament. The Wales job, recently vacated by Widnes' Neil Kelly, will be taken by Leeds assistant coach Stuart Wilkinson and his director of rugby at Headingley, Wayne O'Kell, the current Wales A coach, will work with Wilkinson with the full national side. Daryl Powell will be in charge of Ireland with Dewsbury's Andy Kelly as his number two. Whitehaven boss Steve McCormack will coach the Scotland side with St Helens' Dave Rotheram as his assistant. RFL performance director David Waite said: \"The appointments for the European Nations Cup demonstrates the depth and quality of Rugby League coaching talent emerging in the UK. \"The tournament is not only an exciting concept for players but it provides an excellent opportunity for coaches to hone their abilities and experience the unique challenges of working with a representative side.\" Wigan's Dave Lyon will coach the England Academy Under-18 side on their tour of New Zealand and Australia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
