The country\u2019s Central Election Commission said that Kassym-Jomart Tokayev received 70.76% of the vote and his nearest challenger, opposition candidate Amirzhan Kosanov, 16.2%. Hundreds of people were arrested on Sunday while protesting against the stage-managed election which they aid would deprive them of a political voice. Voters went to the polls to elect a successor to Nazarbayev, the 78-year-old who ruled for three decades before resigning this year. But with the last of the region\u2019s communist-era presidents stepping aside rather than stepping down, there are concerns that Kazakhstan is yet to break free of the past. Tokayev, the interim president and a loyal Nazarbayev lieutenant, offered 18 million Kazakhs a back-to-the-future manifesto. The ruling clique\u2019s top-down imposition of Tokayev has sparked outrage. \u201cI want to change this regime that we\u2019ve had for 30 years,\u201d said a young woman, speaking on condition of anonymity, during an election day demonstration in Almaty, Kazakhstan\u2019s commercial capital. The deputy interior minister Marat Kozhayev said three police were injured in clashes and 500 demonstrators were taken to police stations. There were no immediate reports on whether charges were being filed. Chris Rickleton, a British journalist with Agence France-Presse, was briefly detained and sustained a black eye during his arrest. Tokayev tried to play down the protests. It was the \u201cpeople\u2019s choice\u201d to protest, though elections should not be a \u201cbattlefield\u201d, he said after casting his vote in the capital, Nur-Sultan, which was called Astana until March, when Tokayev ordered that it be renamed after Nazarbayev. Scores of demonstrators were also arrested in the city on election day. The regime has sought to present the election as a force for stability. Some voters happily endorsed Tokayev\u2019s pledge of continuing the policies of Nazarbayev. However, there are concerns that Nazarbayev may retain power behind the scenes, with many believing his long-term plan is to install as president his politician daughter, Dariga Nazarbayeva. \u201cI trusted our former president for many years, and if he recommended Tokayev, I think it\u2019s the right choice,\u201d Irina, a retired architect who declined to give her surname, said after voting in Almaty. The election results are expected on Monday. Opinion polls have Tokayev on more than 70% of the vote \u2013 short of the 98% landslide recorded by Nazarbayev in the last election, which, like every other vote held in Kazakhstan, was most likely to have been rigged, according to international monitors. This elections offers voters slightly more choice than usual, seven candidates, including Kosanov, a veteran opposition leader. \u201cI voted for Kosanov because I\u2019m against the government,\u201d said 27-year-old Zhakip, dismissing rumours that the candidate had done a deal with the government to stand. This is the first time a presidential election has included a candidate with a claim to representing the opposition since 2005. But many of those yearning for change say they have found his campaign too mild-mannered. As the regime seeks to keep a lid on dissent, pro-democracy campaigners have been harassed, assaulted and jailed, including a young man and woman who spent two weeks in prison for displaying a banner calling for a fair election at a marathon race in Almaty. The banner read: \u201cYou can\u2019t run away from the truth.\u201d A campaign calling for change has also sprung up on social media, using the hashtags #qazaqkoktemi (Kazakh spring) and #menoyandim (I\u2019ve woken up). A new movement called Wake Up, Qazaqstan has emerged from it, calling for democratic reforms. The \u201cwake up\u201d theme comes from a 1909 poem written during Russian colonial rule. \u201cWake up, Kazakh! Think, Kazakh! Be, Kazakh!\u201d it reads. \u201cWe are a nation that has forgotten its freedom.\u201d The movement is inspired by \u201ca yearning for freedom\u201d said Anuar Nurpeisov, an actor behind the original Instagram campaign. \u201cThis generation is tired of living under the leadership of people who grew up in the Soviet Union.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
