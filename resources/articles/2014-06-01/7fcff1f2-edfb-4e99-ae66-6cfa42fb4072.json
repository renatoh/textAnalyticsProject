The Liverpool veteran, who will earn his 112th cap at the Arena Amaz\u00f4nia against the Azzurri, considers the honour of leading his country in the tournament to be the pinnacle of his international career. This is likely to prove the 34-year-old\u2019s last finals and, as one of a handful of senior figures among a relatively inexperienced squad, Gerrard will issue his own rallying cry to the England players just before kick-off. \u201cI will say something in the dressing room, towards the end when we are ready to go out, and it will be: \u2018Let\u2019s not have any regrets,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAll the preparation has been done. The squad that\u2019s been picked is very bold and brave. Let\u2019s believe we have all the energy and all the work in the legs and in the tank, so now let\u2019s relax and let it happen. The key is just to not come off the pitch with any regrets and, basically, do what it takes to get that result. \u201cI will be proud leading this group of players out against Italy. I trust them and I believe in my team-mates, but I will be even prouder if we come home from this tournament with our heads held high knowing we have gone out on to the pitch and given everything we have got for the English public back home. And, looking at the lads and being in and around them, I get the impression they are ready to give everything they have got. It is here now. All the distances and the miles we have covered, the heat preparation, we have done all that. There are no excuses now. It is time to walk the walk.\u201d Roy Hodgson is expected to select Danny Welbeck on the left of his attacking trident, playing behind Daniel Sturridge, after the Manchester United forward recovered from a thigh strain suffered earlier this week to take part in training at the new Arena Amaz\u00f4nia. \u201cIt was a niggle which doesn\u2019t stop him from playing, and he could start,\u201d said the England manager of Welbeck, whose involvement is likely to mean Raheem Sterling starting on the bench. Southampton\u2019s Adam Lallana is expected to operate on the right with Wayne Rooney as the central playmaker. Sterling\u2019s opportunity will come in this tournament, with Ross Barkley also hoping to make his mark at some stage. \u201cNo doubt if I was watching from afar with no responsibility, I\u2019d be clamouring myself for the youngsters,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cThese are the players who don\u2019t have the baggage to carry with them, they are exciting talents with fantastic potential, but you have to be careful that we don\u2019t throw them into the lion\u2019s den too early and we have to be aware that the World Cup is a little bit special.\u201d Temperatures at kick-off on Saturday evening tonight are expected to be touching 30C which while stiflingly hot, will technically rule out the possibility of formal \u201ccooling breaks\u201d after Fifa reiterated that official three-minute stoppages of play to take on liquids should be enforced by the referee only if the heat exceeds 32C. The humidity will be oppressive, and there remain lingering concerns over the quality of the pitch at the stadium, which is hosting its first event. \u201cWhen things don\u2019t go right, the easy way out for footballers is to look for an excuse,\u201d added Gerrard. \u201cYou look at other people and point fingers and blame others and say: \u2018Well, that wasn\u2019t right, this wasn\u2019t right.\u2019 But, for me, the FA have left the players with no excuses in every tournament I\u2019ve been in. They try their best and maybe it is 99.9% right, but this time they have put everything in place. They have done everything they possibly can for the players to perform. \u201cWhen the whistle goes against Italy, you are on your own. You are with your team and your squad and you have to have belief in what we are going into the tournament with. I think we are in a good place. The squad is very talented, with a good blend of players who have vast experience at this level and have had great careers, and young exciting talents. But everyone knows you get judged after every individual game in these kind of tournaments. \u201cThis is the perfect opener for us because, if we do perform as we know we can and we get that big result that we need, then it can go an awful long way to carry us through. The confidence and belief we would get if we do get the right result could be massive.\u201d Hodgson insisted he had no concerns over the state of the surface at the Arena Amaz\u00f4nia, where England trained for the first time on Friday evening. \u201cI\u2019ve just been on it and we think it\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very flat. I don\u2019t see any reason for any concern. We\u2019ll be happy to play on that pitch. It\u2019ll play well and will suit both teams. The grass is short, the pitch is flat, and we should be able to play good football on it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
