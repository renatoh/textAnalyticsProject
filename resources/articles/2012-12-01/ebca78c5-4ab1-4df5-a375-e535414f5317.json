Jason and Eve Killinger's band messes with the genre template of hypnotic riffs and squalling, rambling solos enough to make Deep Thuds a truly distinctive slab of noise, ranging from damaged boogie to weird, drumless analogue synth swirls and frisky, Afro-tinged acid rock. It's lower than lo-fi, with vocals and sometimes even drums often buried beneath the guitars, but the hooks are golden, cutting through the soupy murk beautifully. It also had one of the year's most eye-catching album covers until a letter from the Rolling Stones' lawyer reportedly forced them to change it. Never mind; the new one is great, too. A fantastic example of US underground rock in 2012."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
