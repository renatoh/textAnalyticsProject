In an extraordinary emergency TV statement at the Lib Dem headquarters in Westminster, Mr Kennedy told reporters: \"I wanted to overcome it privately\" but had been forced to go public ahead of media revelations. He insisted the drink problem was \"essentially resolved\" and that he was \"capable and in good health\". Tonight two of his most likely successors - the party's deputy leader, Sir Menzies Campbell, and its home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten - were quick to rule themselves out of a challenge. Simon Hughes, the party chairman who lost to Mr Kennedy in 1999, is yet to rule himself out, as are more outside figures such as Nick Clegg and David Laws. Mr Hughes's office put out a statement saying Mr Kennedy had been \"brave\" in making his problem public, but made no mention of whether he would or would not stand against his leader. But, simultaneous to Mr Kennedy's acceptance of his personal problems with alcohol, it emerged that a letter signed by nearly half the Lib Dem shadow cabinet expressing disquiet at his political leadership had been circulated by the party's Treasury spokesman, Vince Cable. That double whammy appears to leave Mr Kennedy in a highly precarious position - or at least a power vacuum at the heart of the party as it seeks to deal with an apparently resurgent Conservative party under David Cameron. With Mr Kennedy vowing to fight any challenge, all will be aware of the precedent of Michael Heseltine - that the colleague who wields the knife rarely inherits the throne. Under new rules agreed last year at party conference any MP standing against Mr Kennedy must have the backing of at least seven Lib Dem MPs, from a total of 62. Mark Oaten, a potential frontrunner and the party's home affairs spokesman, immediately ruled himself out of the contest. He told the Press Association: \"I think the way in which he has gone about tackling this personal issue has been brave and commendable. \"I will be actively campaigning for Charles as he reconfirms the members' support. \"I know that we can use this as an opportunity to put forward our Liberal agenda and emphasise Charles's strengths as our leader.\" Mr Kennedy revealed he was only admitting the treatment after being contacted about the story by ITV. He refused to answer questions, but told a packed press conference: \"People close to me know that this has been a struggle and that for extended periods I've consumed no alcohol at all. \"As a matter of fact I've not had a drink for the past two months and I don't intend to in the future. \"I learned the hard way of the need to face up to this medical problem, one that is dealt with successfully by many others on a daily basis. \"I've chosen not to acknowledge it publicly before in this way because, if at all possible, I'd wanted to overcome it privately. So, in a sense, this admission today comes as something of a personal relief.\" Tonight's emergency statement came after a solid three months of sniping at Mr Kennedy's leadership style, some of it off the record, but an increasing amount in public and coming from frontbench colleagues. The letter circulated by Mr Cable, expressing dissatisfaction with Mr Kennedy was signed by 11 Lib Dem frontbenchers - including, according to some reports, such previously loyal figures as Sarah Teather, Ed Davey and Norman Lamb. Although the text of the letter has not yet been released, it is thought to have been signed by: Vincent Cable, Norman Baker, Sarah Teather, Andrew George, Sandra Gidley, Michael Moore, and others, and circulated over Christmas. The behind-the-scenes briefing - about Mr Kennedy's laidback, consensual style of leadership, and about his drinking habits - resurfaced in earnest at the party's conference in Blackpool last September. What was supposed to be a celebration of the biggest number of Lib Dem MPs in 80 years - a total of 62, up from 45 when Mr Kennedy took over from Paddy Ashdown - turned into a sour affair, with defeats from the floor on leadership motions over privatising the Royal Mail and the size of the EU budget. And behind the scenes, potential challenger Simon Hughes was forced to go in person to tell Mr Kennedy he was not behind the briefing on his leadership and would not stand against him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
