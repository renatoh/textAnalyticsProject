While 40,000 locals turn out for the city's annual 10km fun run in April, they spend the rest of the year hanging out in Stanley Park, sipping chai lattes in streetside cafes and meandering through shops, restaurants and bars in comfortably cool neighbourhoods. Even high culture gets an easygoing spin here: Bard On The Beach, Vancouver's summer Shakespeare festival, is staged in waterfront marquees, with the North Shore mountains providing the backdrop. And it's the spectacular surroundings that give the city its contented air. To tap into this, most visitors head first for Stanley Park, a giant wooded peninsula on the west side of downtown. Hiring a bike or rollerblades at one of the rental shops on nearby Denman Street, you can cruise the park's 10km sea wall like a local. Or pass a long lazy day strolling secluded forest trails. But it's the early evening summer views that encourage most to stick around: simply perch on a log at Third Beach,and take in the jaw-dropping ocean sunsets. Most visitors head to the North Shore for their main rainforest fix. The Capilano Suspension Bridge and Park has been a tourist landmark for more than 100 years, encouraging generations to shuffle across its gently swaying 137m-long pedestrian bridge 70m above the tree-lined Capilano Canyon. Its new Treetops attraction, added in 2004, enables visitors to amble along an additional 200m of suspension bridges linking eight Douglas fir trees 25m above the forest floor. But chill-out Vancouver is not just about communing with nature. While downtown contains some of the city's main attractions - including the boutiques of Robson Street - those in the know avoid the crush by hitting some of Vancouver's more eclectic and laid-back neighbourhoods. Gastown, a short walk from the city centre, is a pretty cobbled area of reclaimed brick warehouses. Don't be put off by the tacky souvenir stores here - there are also a couple of good first nations art galleries, several streetside cafes and one of the city's most genial pubs. The cosy, wood-floored Irish Heather on Carrall Street is where the locals come for beer and snacks, but only the savviest Vancouverites know about Shebeen Whisky House, a quiet second bar at the back where dozens of rare whiskeys are served from a tiny counter. Those recovering from the resulting hangover often stumble across town next morning to Commercial Drive. Vancouver's number one patio hangout spot is an enclave of independent Italian coffee shops; the best is the Calabria Coffee Bar, complete with a kitsch interior that could have been designed by Liberace. The bus from nearby Broadway will deliver you to the edge of the city's most laid-back neighbourhood. Once a community of 1960s hippies, Kitsilano is now a middle-class district of beachfront parks and picturesque streets lined with wooden heritage homes, bookstores and cafes. Some of the shops on 4th Avenue offer a crash-course in West Coast living, particularly the Lululemon Athletica outlet, stocking the comfortable, yoga-inspired leisure gear that locals seem to wear all the time. In a city where dressing-up usually involves a clean fleece top or a fresh pair of jeans, even high-end eateries are refreshingly snob-free. For the best in West Coast dining - a fusion of regional flavours that can range from Pacific wild salmon to Cowichan Valley duck - the Mediterranean-influenced CinCin on Robson Street, fresh seafood specialist C Restaurant on Howe Street and Lumiere on Broadway are highly recommended. Next door to Lumiere, the new Feenies is testament to the city's casual approach to eating out - it features comfort food with a gourmet flourish: high-end hot dogs and an addictive duck shepherd's pie. Vancouver's bars are similarly laid-back. Yaletown, a gentrified former industrial district near the city centre, houses both the Yaletown Brewing Company - a large, exposed brick restaurant and bar that brews its own seasonal beers - and Afterglow, an intimate mod lounge specialising in martinis and strong Quebec beers. Comfort is also the key at several of Vancouver's best boutique hotels. Yaletown's Opus Hotel has some offers designer suites in the city but the five-star Wedgewood on Hornby Street takes a more traditional approach, with its over-stuffed leather chairs and Italianate interiors - a favourite with rock stars and actors on location. The ivy covered, brick-built Sylvia Hotel in English Bay, though, is hard to beat. With its cosy charm and breathtaking waterfront views, it exemplifies the unique chill-out credentials of the entire city.
