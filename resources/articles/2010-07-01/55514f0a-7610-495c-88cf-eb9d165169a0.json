Throughout the tournament ITV has been keen to offer something different from its public service rival, signalled by its selection of Adrian Chiles as anchor, where in the past reliable ex-BBC men like Des Lynam and Steve Rider have been drafted in. Their advertisers will have appreciated this shift, but for the rest of us the effect was that ITV's coverage became too jokey \u2013 as opposed to funny \u2013 by half. The fact their highlights package on semi-final night included a clip of Ned Boulting saying \"Hi, I'm Ned Boulting, and I am in a shebeen,\" and another of Chiles being hit in the nuts during a kickaround, tells you all you need to know about ITV's World Cup. Both sides were united last night, however, in the view that the quality of the tournament warranted a feast of football (ITV), and a final to savour (BBC). Whatever gave them that idea? Maybe you had to be there. For those of us at home watching TV, it has probably been the worst World Cup of modern times. Fifa's feed has had me pining for Sky's Premier League coverage. The silly overhead shot as free-kicks are lined up, and too many infuriating super slo-mo replays of players walking back into position after relatively minor incidents have been unwelcome interruptions. At least for most of last night, there was little chance of the replays causing us to miss any sparkling live action. Our own boys \u2013 and the odd girl \u2013 flown out there, have done little to enliven the viewing experience either. Both sides tried a few wild cards on the pundits' benches early on, but ended up last night with familiar timeworn line-ups. Where are the Brian Cloughs, Martin O'Neills, David Ginolas and Leonardos of former tournaments? Over the month the BBC has shaded it. Though it was all a little golf club cosy, and Alan Shearer is never going to rate much higher than rickets in the nation's affections, Alan Hansen and Lee Dixon are fluent in football speak and offer the odd insight. Gary Lineker has sharpened up his comic timing as well, but disappointingly remains no more than three times as funny as James Corden's World Cup Live, signing off last night after a month-long run, which coincided with the hay fever season, but proved less susceptible to pharmaceuticals. You cannot fault Corden for enthusiasm, though. Each evening he has been bounding on to screen with the puppy-dog exuberance of a much-loved family pet diagnosed with a fatal disease, whose owners cannot bear to have him put down. My guess is that the show was not aimed at those of us who remember the Cloughs and O'Neills of yesteryear, but at ITV's advertisers looking to build on the football audience with more young males and females. I reckon even the youngsters, though, at who it is aimed might have been embarrassed by Corden's mugging on the dance floor and high-pitched giggle, reminiscent of David Brent at his most cringeworthy, and felt themselves patronised by his use of street slang for \"comic\" effect. Not that it was necessary to travel too far to be patronised, especially if you were African. Both channels managed to patronise a whole continent with their embarrassingly pro-Africa slant. In fairness, the BBC had a nice sequence of football playing kids mirroring World Cup incidents last night, but Andy Townsend and Gareth Southgate visiting Regina Mundi church in Soweto and exchanging platitudes with Chiles was just plain embarrassing. On third-place final night Chiles would not shut up about Luis Su\u00e1rez denying Ghana a place in the semi-finals, when as everyone knows \u2013 and Craig Burley said on ITV \u2013 any player would have reacted as the Uruguayan did. Africa good, the rest of the world bad, seemed to be the mantra this World Cup. If it is possible for a continent to be patted on the head, ITV and BBC managed it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
