But the next 15 minutes he nutmegged me three or four times, so I went and marked someone else.\" Ince had great admiration for Mancini as a player, describing him as \"one of the best\" he ever came up against, and he also has a high opinion of him as a manager. \"He reminds me of a younger Sir Alex Ferguson,\" said Ince, who played under the United manager for six years before moving to Inter. \"He won't take any rubbish and he will do it his way. I like him as a manager. I think he is different class.\" Although Ince laughs mockingly at the suggestion that City are now as big a draw as United in the FA Cup, he does see similarities between Mancini's team and the double-winning 1994 side he played in at Old Trafford. \"Manchester City have a long way to go when you look at what Manchester United have achieved over the last 20 years. But, saying that, they are a fantastic club with fantastic players. \"It kind of reminds me of when I was at Manchester United with Sir Alex \u2013 we had a lot of players there with a lot of egos: Cantona, Keany, Schmeichel, me. We all disagreed and were not scared to give an opinion. You talk about fights on the training pitch \u2013 that happened all the time at United. But the way Fergie brought the team together was special. That is the art of management. Mancini has a lot of egos at City and he has got to keep a lot of people happy; and, of course, the fights get highlighted more. But he has done ever so well to control those egos and get them playing the way they are.\" Ince wishes he had been stricter during his six months in charge of Blackburn, which ended with his sacking in December 2008. \"I remember when we played Manchester United in the League Cup and Sir Alex said to me: 'Listen, Paul, there is one thing you've got to learn. Don't give them an inch. If you do, they'll take the micky.' That's one thing he was spot on about, and next time that won't be the case, that's for sure.\" Ince has a very different challenge at Notts County, where he is trying to bring stability to a club that has been through a tumultuous 18 months at the same time as seeking to rebuild his reputation as a manager. A victory against City would be a big step in the right direction for both objectives. \"You've got to go into these games in the right frame of mind,\" he said. \"If they don't, it will give us a bit of hope.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
