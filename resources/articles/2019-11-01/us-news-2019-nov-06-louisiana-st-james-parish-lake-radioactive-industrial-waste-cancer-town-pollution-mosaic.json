She doesn\u2019t know why this is, but it\u2019s difficult not to wonder if there\u2019s a link to the sprawling radioactive waste storage structure that sits less than a mile from her tidy cottage in the fourth district of St James Parish, Louisiana. It is a gargantuan manmade 960-acre lake containing hundreds of millions of gallons of toxic, radioactive water that sits on top of a 200ft pile of waste byproduct, an enormous, chalky white wall that makes the bulldozers and cranes atop look like children\u2019s toys. The massive white mound is shaped like a giant bathtub, formed with a naturally radioactive element called phosphogypsum and filled with toxic cargo. It has reshaped the horizon in this parish, which has transitioned from a center of slavery, to black-owned farmland, to an industrial corridor. Melancon lives close enough to the big \u201cgypstack\u201d mound as it\u2019s known, to hear occasional sirens and loudspeaker announcements. \u201cIf that broke open, how could you contain it all?\u201d wondered Melancon from her front patio. And fears of exactly this scenario of a breach grew dramatically in January, when it emerged one of its walls was found to be shifting by as much as 0.7in a day, potentially threatening to spill its store of 750m gallons of toxic, radioactive wastewater on to surrounding lands and waterways. \u2018They don\u2019t tell us anything\u2019 The 87-year-old lives in the heart of an area known as Cancer Alley, a stretch of land between New Orleans and Baton Rouge along the Mississippi River with a dense concentration of petrochemical and industrial plants, and some of the nation\u2019s highest cancer rates. Her municipality neighbours Saint John the Baptist parish, which is the focus of a year-long Guardian series, Cancer Town, examining the fight for clean air in an area that has the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxins, according to US government science. Melancon is affiliated with a group of activists, led by black women, many of whom can trace their ancestry to former slaves from nearby plantations, fighting on multiple fronts to stop further industrial development in this already heavily polluted and economically disadvantaged area. But that giant lake of industrial waste, and the piles of phosphogypsum containing it, is the most concerning to Melancon right now. It is owned by the Mosaic Company, a fertilizer producer, and lies directly across from her front porch. Even as the Louisiana department of environmental quality (LDEQ) considered the discovery of the shifting wall in January an \u201cemergency condition\u201d and Mosaic told some farmers that it leases land to that they could not be on the property for months, residents only heard about the situation after it was reported in the local news. \u201cNone of us knew what was up,\u201d said Matthew Jacques, 28, said of the situation. He lives in a house two doors down from Melancon. \u201cThey don\u2019t tell us anything.\u201d For many residents in this predominantly black area, LDEQ and the companies behind pollutive industries have a virtually non-existent approach to community health and safety. \u201cWe feel that it\u2019s environmental racism, because basically where most of the plants are located is where black people are staying,\u201d said Barbara Washington, a lifelong resident of the area and a member of Rise St James, the environmental justice group formed by parish residents. \u201cThey just let us die out here,\u201d said Washington about the experience of living in Cancer Alley. The Mosaic fertilizer plant has been a continuing source of concern among many residents since opening in the 1970s. Even at the best of times, the storage site across from Melancon\u2019s house, known as the Uncle Sam site, is an eyesore that has been under a consent decree since 2015 for releasing excessive amounts of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid mist into the air. A farmer who grows sugarcane on Mosaic property adjacent to the gypstack was the first to alert the company to the problem last December, when he reported a land bulge \u2013 about 2,000ft long and 100ft wide \u2013 that was pushing on the north wall of the gypstack, causing it to move. Since the shifting wall was first reported to state authorities on 10 January, the company has been scrambling to reduce the imminent threat of a gypsum break. \u201cIf there\u2019s any kind of spill, we\u2019re looking at a world-class environmental disaster,\u201d said Darryl Malek-Wiley, a senior organizing representative with the Sierra Club who has been tracking the Mosaic plant since the 1980s, when it unsuccessfully lobbied the EPA for permission to dump all gypsum waste into the Mississippi River. \u201cI do not feel they have it anywhere close to under control.\u201d The gypstack pile is made of phosphogypsum, which is a byproduct of the process that converts phosphate rock into a type of fertilizer widely used on large farms. For every ton of phosphate fertilizer, about 5.5 tons of phosphogypsum waste is created, which then must be kept indefinitely in stacks, or gypstacks, because it is weakly radioactive. Mosaic argues the dangers of this massive gypstack are overstated. Spokeswoman Callie Neslund said the company has drastically reduced water levels in the giant tank, and has also undertaken efforts to counterbalance movement of the shifting wall with the construction of a large earthen ramp. The company says that the gypstack itself may no longer be moving due to data readings on the gypstack remaining within the \u201cmargin of error\u201d and farmers leasing land have been allowed back on the property. State regulators could not confirm movement had stopped. Residents and activists say the danger from Mosaic is far from over. A company decision to idle its Louisiana plant until the end of the year, leaving a skeleton crew of 65-80 employees, has raised concerns among many here and prompted some still unanswered questions from regulators on how the company will handle on-site wastewater during the shutdown. In late October, Mosaic told the LDEQ that heavy rainfall had prompted the company to begin emergency water diversions from its gypstack system to other storage areas on site. Over the past month, the total amount of wastewater stored on the Mosaic site increased by over 100m gallons. Water levels within the gypstack that had found to be shifting in January remained slightly above 180ft on 31 October, 1ft above EPA recommended limits. Fans plan prompts new fight Residents are also concerned about Mosaic\u2019s pursuit of a plan to further cut water levels by installing huge fans on the top of the gypstack that would spray a fine mist of untreated, contaminated wastewater into the surrounding area. The firm defends the plan to use four giant fans known as \u201cspray evaporators\u201d and says the contaminated mist will not travel, roughly, beyond the storage pond perimeter. Residents are skeptical. \u201cHow can they possibly get away with that, knowing there\u2019s people in the area?\u201d asked Myrtle Felton, a member of Rise who lives about a half-mile from the Uncle Sam site. \u201cThey don\u2019t care,\u201d said Gail Lebouef, another Rise member who lives nearby. Malek-Wiley, who questions the accuracy of Mosaic\u2019s model predicting mist dispersion, called it \u201cone of the craziest ideas I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. He said of particular concern is the hydrogen fluoride in the water, a potent chemical that can cause burns or death at high enough concentrations. The wastewater also contains radioactive compounds like radium 226, a known carcinogen, which has a half-life of 1,600 years. The company estimates the fans would run for up to 4,380 hours a year, or 12 hours every day, running through about 631m gallons of contaminated water a year. \u201cAeration is not the answer,\u201d said Wilma Subra, a prominent environmental scientist and toxics expert who has been closely monitoring the case. \u201cAnything deposited on that community will be there forever.\u201d Members of Rise St James were surprised to learn that the company was still pursuing its fan plan after the LDEQ first rejected the idea this summer. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame, I thought it was a done deal with the fans,\u201d said Sharon Lavigne, director and president of Rise St James. \u201cWe still have to fight.\u201d The sinkhole Residents point to Mosaic\u2019s history as cause for further concern. In August 2016, a sinkhole opened up under a gypsum stack, similar to the one in St James, at Mosaic\u2019s Mulberry phosphate processing plant in Florida. About 215m gallons of polluted process water drained into an underground aquifer. Mosaic informed Florida\u2019s department of environmental protection (DEP) right away about water loss, but didn\u2019t immediately disclose the sinkhole. Almost three weeks passed before either Mosaic or the DEP informed the public, despite the fact that the sinkhole was initially considered a potential threat to the public\u2019s water supply. The company has been under the consent decree with EPA and the Department of Justice since 2015 for violations related to hazardous waste disposal at its six sites in Florida and Louisiana, including the Uncle Sam facility. Some activists have called for a complete closure of the plant in light of January\u2019s news about the wall of the gypsum shifting. Lavigne of Rise St James said any plant should be closed down that is releasing toxic emissions, which have been linked to cancer and other potentially fatal health issues. \u201cIf it\u2019s killing us, shut it down,\u201d she said. Environmental racism The Mosaic issue is one of several facilities that Rise St James and other advocacy groups say have caused a slow-motion environmental and public health disaster erasing the majority-black population here. Rise and affiliated advocacy groups claimed a surprising victory in September when Wanhua Chemical withdrew its approved application to develop a $1.25bn petrochemical facility nearby. The group has turned its attention to stopping a $9.4bn petrochemical complex being developed in the area by Taiwanese company Formosa Plastics Group. If approved, that project alone would effectively double chemical emissions in the area. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for our life,\u201d declared Lavigne. She said recent blood tests found aluminum linked to industrial pollutants in her body, and doctors are now monitoring her liver for any health complications. \u201cThey\u2019re killing us off, one by one.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
