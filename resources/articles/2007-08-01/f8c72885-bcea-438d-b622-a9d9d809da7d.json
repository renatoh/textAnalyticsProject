Instead it is more likely you will be thinking about settling in, socialising and, oh yes, your course. However, before you know it you will be faced with the scary prospect of the graduate job market. So it doesn't hurt to make like a boy scout and \"be prepared\" when considering your future career, even at this early stage. \"More motivated students, who think about their careers earlier, do better when it comes to finding a job,\" says Sybil Zao-Sanders, spokeswoman for Pure Potential (purepotential.org), which offers careers advice to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. \"So many students are getting good A-levels and are going to excellent universities that employers are looking for that something extra. Securing work experience early on shows you have certain skills but also that you have ambition.\" Ben Reeves, 20, is just starting his third year of a journalism degree at the University of Lincoln. He hopes to secure a job in print or TV journalism when he graduates and realised in his first year he would need an impressive bank of work experience to get the edge in this competitive industry. \"Three years at university is a relatively short time, so I thought about giving myself the best chance of getting a job. Between my first and second years I worked at my local paper, the Selby Times. I got my first published story and made good contacts. Now the staff at the paper know me, which will be useful when I apply for jobs.\" Tolu Odusanwo, 19, has just completed a work experience stint at Graveney secondary school in Tooting, London. The Cambridge University student, who hopes to become a teacher before moving on to school leadership, sought a job placement during her first year. \"My course will be getting harder from now on, so I thought it would be best to do it now while there was less academic pressure,\" she explains. \"Work experience is a big advantage when applying for a PGCE, but it also gives you a better understanding of working in a school setting and helps to ensure it is the career track you want to follow. It certainly made me realise that is was a lot harder work than I anticipated but it hasn't put me off at all.\" Of course different careers will demand different skills, so Zao-Sanders recommends having a wide-ranging career plan in place, rather than just concentrating on work experience. \"Get advice on how to write a CV and think about working on your interview skills, as it takes a while to learn how to demonstrate your abilities. Your university careers service should be able to help you and there are plenty of websites offering advice about how to cope in job situations.\" Taking small steps to improve your career prospects can also be vital, according to Husnara Begum, editor of law student magazine, Lawyer 2B. \"Concentrate on activities you can do on campus in your first year, so join the debating society.\" First steps \u00b7 Start thinking about securing work placements as soon as possible - many take months to organise. \u00b7 Get online. Visit careers sites such as Prospects (prospects.ac.uk) and Aim Higher (aimhigher.ac.uk). \u00b7 Find out if your student union runs any extra-curricular skills courses, such as desktop publishing, leadership or languages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
