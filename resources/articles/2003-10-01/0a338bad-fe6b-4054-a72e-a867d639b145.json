It looks, for all the world, like an ancient Chinese yin-yang symbol inscribed, unexpectedly, in the pages of a polite Surrey landscape near Woking. On closer inspection, the interweaving black and white elements of this ambitious new headquarters for the TAG McLaren Group - makers of McLaren grand prix racing cars - prove to be a pairing of an artificial lake and a kidney-shaped factory. As in the yin-yang symbol, these two elements are interactive and interdependent. Each gives the other energy; you cannot have one without the other. At the core of the gleaming glass and aluminium building, nearing completion, is a mighty, doughnut-shaped wind tunnel. This is an essential tool in the design and development of modern racing cars. It generates great heat, which is cooled by the lake water as it laps over a 160-metre long waterfall at its edges. The lake, lovely in its own right, is also a tool: it helps to cool not just the wind tunnel, but the whole engineering complex. What McLaren is building here is a factory that is both landscape art and an environmentally concerned hi-tech production plant. It is utterly unlike belching car factories of the past. Ron Dennis, the group's chairman, describes his brainchild as \"95% an automotive form of NASA, and 5% theatre\". He could add that it is also, quite simply, a thing of beauty. Traditionally, British racing-car manufacturers have beavered away in nondescript industrial sheds. In recent years, however, as technology and expertise have developed (notably in the home counties), this amateur-style work arrangement has seemed out of gear with the international status of the industry it serves and frames. Five years ago, McLaren decided it needed a new home. Not any home, but the sleekest and most sophisticated factory it could afford. The new \"technology centre\" opens next spring when not just its machinery, but also its landscaping, is complete, and when the otters, adders, bats, dragonflies and other fauna and flora that thrive around the River Wey have resettled. It might seem odd to describe a factory designed to make screaming formula one cars and 200mph road cars for the super-rich as \"green\", yet McLaren has been trying to create a building that enhances rather than detracts from the acres of greenbelt it occupies. From the road, screened by saplings, the great aluminium factory - it could house seven jumbo jets, says McLaren - is all but invisible. Equally invisible is a dramatic two-storey domed underground visitor and education centre. The aim is to make McLaren, currently spread across 18 separate sites, part and parcel of the local area as well as a visitor attraction, and a worldwide magnet for future hi-tech engineers and designers. Not that McLaren needs to advertise itself. Its cars have enjoyed considerable grand prix success ever since Emerson Fittipaldi became F1 world champion at the wheel of a McLaren in 1974. At every turn, the form and detailing of the Woking technology centre is designed to reflect McLaren engineering values and aesthetics. In Norman Foster and his team, famed for their delight in advanced engineering and materials technology, Dennis found the perfect design partner to give shape to the new complex. Foster's love of aerospace design is well documented in his buildings, and notably from the hangar-like Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, that celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. As part of their brief for McLaren, Foster &amp; Partners were asked to create a working environment so attractive that people would find it hard to leave for home. \"We want to put a skip in people's step,\" says Dennis. \"We all want our company to win, and I'm not just talking about winning grands prix. To win we need highly motivated, dedicated people, and such people can only exist if you provide them with an environment in which they can aspire to be the best. Great facilities attract great people, and that's where the story of this project has its roots.\" Detailing through the 200-metre long factory promises to be a fusion of Foster's architecture and Dennis's cars. The serpentine lakeside facade of the building, for example, that appears in some lights to touch the water, is composed of glass supported by aluminium wind blades and slim stainless-steel tie rods. The 12-metre perforated blades are modelled on the rear-wing support struts of the 1995 Le Mans-winning McLaren F1 GTR and manufactured by a process similar, says McLaren, to that employed in the production of wing frames on Airbus jets by BAE Systems, one of the Woking firm's \"technology partners\". \"There are lots of parallels to formula one,\" says Dennis. \"There has been the same search for perfection, the same search for performance and the same demand for proven cutting-edge technology. We didn't want to be a guinea pig for technology, but we did want the latest and the best.\" In simple visual terms - seen from the ground - the curvaceous building calls to mind the snaking flow of grand prix circuits as well as the flowing forms of racing cars. They make me think, too, of the stirring words Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (1876-1944), the iconoclastic Italian poet and polemicist wrote in his famous Futurist Manifesto of 1909: \"We declare that the world's wonder has been enriched by a fresh beauty, the beauty of speed. A racing car with its trunk adorned by great exhaust pipes like snakes with an explosive breath ... is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace.\" Although it contains the notion of speed in its flowing form - as, pace Marinetti, does the Winged Victory of Samothrace - Foster's McLaren factory is a temple of peace. Doubtless, Dennis and his team want it to be a temple of victory, too. The world's latest car factories (VW at Dresden, Rolls-Royce at Goodwood) are becoming more svelte and sophisticated than the contemporary art galleries and museums. Herzog and de Meuron's Tate Modern is positively macho compared with Henn Architects' glass-walled VW Phaeton factory set in a revived city park in central Dresden. Frank Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim, all jutting jaws and gleaming spikes, contrasts dramatically with Foster's cool, sinuous McLaren Technology Centre. Inside, the 100-metre deep Woking building, two \"boulevards\" will connect all parts of the hushed production areas, offices, meeting rooms, VIP suites, staff restaurant, juice bar, giant TV screens monitoring formula one races, and fitness centre. These long, internal streets will, however, be lit dramatically by night, as will the drive up to the complex, the lake, the wind tunnel at its heart and the tunnel burrowing underground to the visitors centre past cabinets of racing trophies and memorabilia. Laboratory-like workspaces will be daylit as far as possible. Where artificial lighting is necessary, the architects promise this will be glare-free. The roof of the building, seen from a distance at night, will appear to hover above its glass walls, while the whole complex will seem to float on the lake. Theatrical design indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
