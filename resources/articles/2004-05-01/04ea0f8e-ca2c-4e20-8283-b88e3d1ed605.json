Rafael Ben\u00edtez arrived at Valencia as a virtual unknown. The Spaniard had never played pro football and surprise promotions with Extremadura and Tenerife counted for little, as did his his work with Real Madrid's B team. Yet in his first season, 2001-02, he won the Spanish title. This season, Valencia have become champions again as well as winning the Uefa Cup. When Alan Curbishley took sole charge of Charlton in 1995, they had just finished 15th in the First Division. This season they were the seventh-best team in England. The Englishman has personified the progress, leading him to be linked with many clubs, and now Liverpool. He has earned great respect for excelling on a shoestring budget. Curbishley left the country to go on holiday yesterday. There has been no contact from Anfield - yet. Gordon Strachan is an outside shot. A former Manchester United player, it would be hard to see the Kop being enchanted by the sometimes prickly Scot. A 2-year spell at Southampton, which produced an FA Cup final appearance, did not entirely erase the memory of his failure to keep Coventry up. He has also been linked with the vacancy at Leeds, a more likely destination than Liverpool. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, seen as Europe's most promising coach, has just strengthened his hand by following Porto's Uefa Cup success last year with a place in tomorrow's Champions League final - quite apart from a second successive domestic title. Perhaps significantly, he has referred to the Liverpool post as being preferable to that at Chelsea. One way or other, it seems certain the Portuguese is heading for the Premiership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
