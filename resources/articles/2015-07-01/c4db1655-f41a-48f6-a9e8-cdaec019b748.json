The cinema screen is a good platform for work so passionately idealistic and, perhaps, grandiose. The pictures are the result of Salgado\u2019s remarkable 40-year career as a photojournalist \u2013 although that word does not do justice to a vocation closer to artist, ethnographer and self-described \u201cwitness to the human condition\u201d. Salgado took stunning pictures in South America, Africa and central Europe, paying tribute to peoples who are dispossessed. He speaks to the camera here about his life and work, like a great big Buddha-like head looming out of the pictures\u2019 glass frames. Wenders says that compassion fuels Salgado\u2019s vision, humanity being the \u201csalt of the earth\u201d. I suspect there is also that Greeneian splinter of ice in his artist\u2019s heart that allows him to capture unbearable images of human agony. Salgado has been accused of fetishising and beautifying suffering and pain: I don\u2019t agree, although Salgado is not asked why he takes only black-and-white photographs, and this is a flaw in the film \u2013 as it goes to the heart of the artistry-over-authenticity debate. Cinematographers Juliano Ribeiro Salgado and Hugo Barbier occasionally show their own black-and-white images bleeding into colour; I would have liked to hear from them directly about how their work was influenced by the subject. Finally, it seems as if Salgado has gone beyond humanity in depicting the natural world: landscapes without people. His best work seems to transcend history itself.
