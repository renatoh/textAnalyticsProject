In her first major speech in the post, May said she was offering the police a \"radical new deal\" under which they would be offered wider professional discretion and operational freedom from Whitehall bureaucracy in return for increased local accountability. She told the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth that the Home Office in general, and the police service in particular, would \"bear a fair share of the burden\" of the coming squeeze in public spending. She announced a \"full review\" of police pay and conditions while reassuring the rank-and-file constables that the remainder of their three-year pay deal struck with the last government would be honoured. The new home secretary also signalled a \"complete review\" of 24-hour drinking laws, arguing that, instead of producing the promised \"cafe culture\", they had only produced problems on the streets. The introduction of directly elected police commisioners is the area most likely to put the new home secretary on course for a head-on clash with the 43 chief constables in England and Wales. May was anxious to answer accusations that direct elections would lead to political interference in local policing. She claimed that the constant interference by previous home secretaries in the way the police service was run amounted to the real politicisation of policing. She promised instead to dismantle the \"targets in disguise\" \u2013 key performance indicators \u2013 imposed by centralised bureaucracy, the demands for paperwork and endless ministerial gimmicks and initiatives dictated by the news cycle rather than what works. Announcing her intention to be \"tough on crime\", she explained: \"I know I'm a new home secretary. I know that many of you don't know me. And I know that you want to know what sort of home secretary I will be. So let me says this: I'm not interested in running the police. If I'd wanted to run the police, I'd have done what you did and joined the police force. That is not the home secretary's job. That's not something many of my predecessors have understood. They just didn't get it.\" May confirmed that she wanted to restore police discretion over charging suspects for many \"minor\" crimes, including assault and theft, and to try to \"untangle the knot\" of health and safety rules. She was applauded when she announced that stop and search forms would be scrapped and other police paperwork restricted. In return, police forces will face new democratic accountability, with directly elected individuals holding chief constables to account without interfering with their operational independence. This will be supplmented by the publication of neighbourhood crime maps and monthly beat meetings where the public can question local policing priorities. Rob Garnham, the chairman of the Association of Police Authorities, said they strongly disagreed with the prosposal for directly elected commissioners, arguing that they would simply introduce more politics to policing. He invited May to see how a modern police authority operated in practice.'ends"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
