But there's a more subtle point of discussion: does television, in a multi-platform culture, still retain any meaningful ability to censor? Throughout its early history, the medium regularly behaved in the manner of a pub landlord, barring undesirables. Dramas \u2013 most notably, Roy Minton's Scum and Dennis Potter's Brimstone and Treacle \u2013 were frequently banned from transmission. And it has been a frequent complaint of those of traditionalist political views \u2013 pro-hanging or against Europe or global warming \u2013 that they are more likely to be shouting at John Humphrys from their kitchen than the Today studio. Yet, since the diversification of media outlets, broadcasters no longer control all their doors. In a preview of this loosening, the most notorious banned television plays were remade as independent movies and released in cinemas. And, now, any public figures unhappy with the rate of invitations to sit around TV and radio tables can broadcast as widely as they like on the web or their telephones. It's a startling thought that, were the Troubles still continuing at the level of the 70s and 80s, the IRA would probably have websites; terrorists might even Twitter. A Thatcher-style ban on alleged terrorists (which forced broadcasters in the 1980s to employ actors to impersonate Gerry Adams and others) would now be made ridiculous. In these conditions, a broadcasting ban on Nick Griffin, whatever the moral case, is useless in practical terms. When the means of broadcasting are owned and controlled, arguments about freedom of speech are necessary. But now that speech is free, talk of banning is arrogant and futile. At least on Question Time Griffin will be questioned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
