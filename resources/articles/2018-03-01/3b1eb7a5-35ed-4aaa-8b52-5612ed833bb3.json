McIlroy, who returns to action at the WGC Match Play on Wednesday, closed with a stunning 64 to prevail at Bay Hill. The success was timely; the Northern Irishman\u2019s next start after this comes in the one major still to elude his grasp. \u201cI have even more optimism now,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cIt was just more validation that what I\u2019ve been doing has been correct. It all sort of just came together. \u201cThere was validation and optimism that I can go ahead and do this more often. I feel like I\u2019ve crossed that line that I needed to. I hadn\u2019t won in the past 18 months. I\u2019m optimistic not just the next few weeks but the whole season. It\u2019s great to get a win early. I\u2019ve got all that great stuff to fall back on, how I handled Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve always been able to turn negatives into positives. I\u2019ve always been able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, even if other people can\u2019t. I went with the feeling that felt quite comfortable going into last week. And I\u2019ll hopefully continue to have that feeling for a while.\u201d His immediate post-tournament feeling was of fatigue, as endorsed by McIlroy\u2019s Sunday celebrations. \u201cTwo glasses of wine and a big bowl of ice cream,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat was it. I watched the highlights but fell asleep.\u201d McIlroy denied that silencing detractors during his injury-triggered slide to No 13 in the world had been uppermost in his thoughts. \u201cI don\u2019t care because people don\u2019t know the full story,\u201d added the 28-year-old. \u201cThey make comments and they speculate but they don\u2019t have the facts 100% so they never really know. It\u2019s all speculation. \u201cSo, no, I\u2019m not in this game to prove people wrong. I\u2019m here to win. I learned a long time ago I can\u2019t please everyone. There\u2019s going to be people that like how you do things, don\u2019t like how you do things and I can\u2019t change their opinion, so I just have to go and do the best that I can. And hopefully when I do try my best and do my best, I\u2019m able to produce results like you saw on Sunday.\u201d McIlroy has Peter Uihlein, Brian Harman and Jhonattan Vegas for company in the group section of the Match Play. The four-times major champion faces Uilhein on Wednesday. Jordan Spieth, who will also compete in Austin, believes McIlroy\u2019s return to form was inevitable. \u201cWhether he won last week or not, he\u2019s always a force,\u201d said the Open champion. \u201cHe just needs to be healthy. And I think most of last season, it was a struggle for him because he knew that he couldn\u2019t have the ball count that he wanted to be at his best yet he was still playing. \u201cSo just being rested, healthy and on the right path meant this year and going forward Rory is Rory. And so he should always be a favourite at any event.\u201d Ian Poulter has turned to the putter he used in the 2012 Ryder Cup as he attempts to secure a Masters berth. The Englishman, who starts this week outside the world\u2019s top 50 and therefore not eligible for the first major of the year, will need to get to the quarter finals at least to book what would be a 13th Augusta appearance. Poulter faces Tommy Fleetwood in what is arguably the pick of the day one ties here. \u201cI don\u2019t want to miss the Masters \u2026 because I know I\u2019m playing well enough,\u201d Poulter said. \u201cI\u2019m still hopeful of being there. On paper it\u2019s simple what I have to do. I\u2019ve set myself the target of at least winning five games in a row.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
