The impassive and very impressive Tony Jaa is the Bruce Lee-style hero, a monk dispatched by his masters to regain the village Buddha's stolen head, and breaking many a head along the way - all without the aid of fancy Crouching Tiger wires and whatnot, too. The Conversation 9pm, Sky Cinema 2 (Francis Ford Coppola, 1974) Coppola knocked out this compelling tale of obsession between Godfathers I and II. Gene Hackman is superb as surveillance expert Harry Caul, tipped into increasingly paranoid suspicions. He's hired by businessman Robert Duvall to spy on a young couple (Cindy Williams, Frederic Forrest) and is drawn, conscience-stricken, into a murder plot. Inside I'm Dancing 3.30am, Sky Movies 1 (Damien O'Donnell, 2004) Another funny, affirmative comedy from the director of East Is East. The subject is the friendship of two men confined to wheelchairs in a Dublin home for disabled people: James McAvoy's Rory is a rebel, raging against his condition; Steven Robertson's Michael a conformist struggling with a speech defect. But together they are Butch and Sundance, in a film that avoids both sentimentality and false optimism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
