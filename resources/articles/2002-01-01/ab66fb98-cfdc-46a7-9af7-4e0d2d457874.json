Despite the biggest build-up of troops along the border since their last war in 1971, India and Pakistan carried out a New Year's Day tradition of exchanging lists of nuclear installations. The exchange took on greater importance this time with the rise in tension between the two neighbours after last month's attack on the Indian parliament. The incident triggered a mobilisation of troops at the border as well as a reduction of bus and air services between the two regional nuclear powers. But India and Pakistan appear to be backing away from a military clash under intense diplomatic pressure from Washington and London and holding out the prospect of a regional summit in Nepal later this week. India has also welcomed the arrest of the militant leader alleged to be behind the attack on India's parliament. As both sides cooled their war rhetoric, Pakistan announced today that Tony Blair will visit Islamabad on January 7 and 8 for talks on the stand-off. \"The regional situation, obviously, will also be one of the subjects to be discussed during that meeting,\" foreign ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan said. Pakistani paper the News, citing an unidentified official, said that Mr Blair would visit both India and Pakistan in an effort to defuse tension between them. Even as both countries say they want peace, there was a heavy exchange of gunfire overnight by troops on both sides of the line of control that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. In Indian-controlled Kashmir, six Hindu civilians were shot and killed in a midnight attack on a remote village in Kashmir. The police identified the attackers as Islamic militants, but have yet to offer evidence that the assailants were Muslim. In neighbouring Punjab state, two army soldiers were killed and at least five others were injured when suspected Islamic militants opened fire on a group of soldiers in Pathankot, 280 miles north of New Delhi. India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, a territory claimed by both countries. India accuses Pakistan of supporting a 12-year insurgency that has cost tens of thousands of lives as militants fight for Kashmir's independence or merger with Pakistan. Pakistan calls the militants freedom fighters, but denies giving them material aid other than the freedom to operate from its soil. Pakistan said it had arrested some 30 members in the last week, including the leaders of the two groups India blamed for the parliament attack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
