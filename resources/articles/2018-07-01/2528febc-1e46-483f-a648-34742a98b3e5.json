For three decades now, Carmody has been one of Australia\u2019s most beloved fantasy authors, for children and adults alike. At just 14 she began work on her first book, Obernewtyn, which was published in 1987 and spawned the fantasy series of the same name. Her novel The Gathering was a high school favourite for many Australian teens and won her both the 1993 Children\u2019s Literature Peace prize and the 1994 CBCA Book of the Year award. But Carmody has also earned a reputation for bravery thanks to her vocal activism against the Australian government\u2019s offshore processing of refugees. In person, Carmody is articulate and outgoing, with vibrant red hair and silver jewellery. She sits across the table from me at a local cafe and gestures expressively with her hands as she talks. Beside us, resting against the table leg for our fellow customers to read, is her latest protest sign. Carmody is deeply passionate about a number of causes, among them China\u2019s bile bears. But it is the plight of the refugees on Nauru and Manus Island that holds most of her attention and her heart. She hasn\u2019t always been as much of an activist as she is now. \u201cI cared about these things, I was informed, and it seemed that I was doing a lot, so it never occurred to me that I should do anything more,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cA lot of writers feel the way I do, but because they write about it they give themselves a pass on doing anything more, and I was one of those people.\u201d Perhaps one of the first and most important things to change was Carmody\u2019s perception of herself. Her partner, Jan, is Czech, and grew up in Europe under communism. Even before Carmody began her protest action, Jan saw a much braver person in her than she was willing to admit. \u201cMy partner once told me that when you grow up under communism, you look at people differently,\u201d Carmody says. She was afraid she might have been what Jan calls a \u201cgrey person\u201d: \u201csomeone who didn\u2019t collaborate, but did nothing to resist.\u201d Some time later, in 2016, Carmody was making dinner for her family when she learnt about Baby Asha, the child born to asylum seeker parents, who had been transported from Nauru to Lady Cilento Children\u2019s hospital in Brisbane for treatment. The doctors at the hospital were refusing to discharge her to prevent her being sent back to the island. Protesters kept a vigil outside the hospital, blockading exits and inspecting cars leaving the building to ensure the child was not removed. Dropping everything and leaving her family to fend for themselves, Carmody joined them. \u201cThat was the beginning for me, at Lady Cilento,\u201d says Carmody. \u201cIt was so special. It had a specific, short-term goal \u2013 it was a child we were protecting, medical staff were validating what we were doing \u2013 everything was right about it. And we were successful. I\u2019ve met many, many people since then at marches and events who say the same thing, that this was the inciting incident for them too.\u201d After the Lady Cilento protest, Carmody wrote letters and signed petitions, \u201call that stuff you do as a moderate-level activist.\u201d She also chatted online with many of the young people in the facilities. Then the closure of the Manus Island facility was announced. As she was preparing for a research trip to the US, Carmody watched her social media feeds in horror as water, electricity, food and medical supplies to the facility were cut off. \u201cI thought, I\u2019m not just going to just get on with my books while that\u2019s happening to human beings at the behest of my government. I\u2019m going to make a sign, and I\u2019m going to stand and hold it up in Oregon. And that\u2019s what I did, day after day.\u201d The first time she stood out in the street with her sign, her hands and knees shook. \u201cI was actually frightened of standing there with that sign. Because people look at you and you\u2019re just so naked in that gaze,\u201d she says. But she soon found an almost meditative aspect to standing alone for an hour at a time each day. \u201cThere\u2019s an introspection in standing. It does make me know myself very well.\u201d Anxiety wasn\u2019t the only obstacle: she also had two fractured knees from a skiing accident, and would limp to her location for the day and prop herself up when she got there. Nevertheless, she says, there is an energy that comes from activism. \u201cStanding up for something you believe in strengthens you and it makes you brave. It gives you the best kind of power.\u201d The sign that rests by our table as we talk has been the subject of many glances, most of them friendly. Carmody updates and rewrites her signs regularly. The phrase \u201cI am watching\u201d often features. Carmody says it is a central part of her message. \u201cIt\u2019s about keeping my eyes on something the government doesn\u2019t want you to see and I want them to know that I won\u2019t look away.\u201d She doesn\u2019t shout slogans at passersby; her protest is mostly silent. \u201cI look in the faces and meet the eyes of the people passing. Not in a confronting way, but I like to meet each person\u2019s eyes as they pass.\u201d It\u2019s important to listen, she says. \u201cPeople say unthinkable things. I try not to react. It\u2019s not in my nature to be angry. It\u2019s in my nature to communicate. It\u2019s much harder for someone to hate you if you are willing to listen to them.\u201d She is also active online. \u201cThe standing is only one part \u2026 the blog posts and social media go much wider.\u201d As a result, there are now people all over Australia who are standing with their own signs because they have seen Carmody doing it, either online or in person. Carmody is aware that speaking out makes her a target; she takes precautions for her safety on the street and says she has been lucky so far. Her writing, though, has suffered. \u201cThis has had a definite impact on my life,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s delayed my books over and again. It hasn\u2019t yet destroyed my health; it might destroy my bank balance, but I don\u2019t care.\u201d She has considered writing about the subject, but says: \u201cA lot of this is too close right now. The alchemy of my writing is very slow, it happens over a long period. It\u2019s a very slow evolution.\u201d She is also aware of her own limits. \u201cThere are lots of people out there doing small things that create a ripple effect. I\u2019m a person who is prepared to make an effort as often and as much as I can. I am one of those people and that\u2019s what I can do,\u201d she says. Approached to run for the Senate, her answer was simple: \u201cThat\u2019s not what I can do.\u201d Carmody was recently issued a fine by Brisbane City council for her one-woman protest. Given the choice to contest the fine, she insists that the issue is not whether or not she can avoid paying it but her right to free speech. \u201cI am not saying that I didn\u2019t do it, I am saying that I have the right to do it. And nobody has the right to get in the way of my free speech. We have to challenge that and we have to push back,\u201d she says. But Carmody isn\u2019t just out there on the street to defend Australia\u2019s freedom of speech; she hopes to galvanise people. \u201cI want people to act, I want people to realise there\u2019s virtue in action and there\u2019s empowerment. I get as much from it as I give. If you\u2019re considering crossing that Rubicon, know this \u2013 once you stand up, you\u2019ll never sit down again. A child\u2019s life for our safety? No, that price is too high.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
