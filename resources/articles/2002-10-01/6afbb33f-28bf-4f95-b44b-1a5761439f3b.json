Sir Alex is understood to have paid only \u00a3120,000 for a 50% share in the horse, which has already achieved superstar status in the sport by becoming the only animal to have won seven successive Group One races, bettering the six wins compiled by Mill Reef some 31 summers ago. Conservative estimates already value Rock Of Gibraltar at around \u00a360m. A similar rate of investment could leave Rio Ferdinand priced somewhere around \u00a37 billion. \u00b7 Am I alone in drawing a parallel between David Seaman's ever more eccentric goalkeeping blunders with a mane of hair that is now a barnet closing in on Lady Godiva proportions? Perhaps if Muhammad Ali were still in his poetry-writing pomp, he would find a way to describe the flowing locks of England's goalkeeper as they advance ever closer to his waist. After all, Ali came up with one of the greatest playful put-downs of all time when he directed his verse toward the famous American television sports commentator and interviewer Howard Cosell, known as much for his journalistic ability as for being a man who wore one of broadcasting's most obvious and preposterous wigs. Ali left Cosell speechless as he ended one interview by saying: \"Howard Cosell, I know you must be a phoney. Because the hair on your head's from the tail of a pony.\" \u00b7 As pipe openers for cricket tours go, England's match against the ABC Chairman's XI at Lilac Hill in Perth could hardly be described as the most onerous of tests but players might be well advised to beware of the dangers in winning the man-of-the-match award. This one-day match is against a team who include Australia's 48-year-old former captain Kim Hughes. Organisers say fun will be the order of the day, with champagne receptions and brass bands competing with cricket as the principal entertainment for Perth's high-society types. Four years ago, in the corresponding fixture, England took on a team who numbered the 49-year-old Dennis Lillee among their bowlers. After helping the tourists to a successful day, Mark Butcher collected the man-of-the-match award. Champagne, cut glass, folding dollars . . . you may well have expected all these to have been part of his reward. But no, he picked up a free-standing trouser press, which he may well not have regarded as the ideal hand baggage with the prospect of three months' continent-hopping yet to come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
