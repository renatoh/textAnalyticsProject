And Darwin! And Melbourne and Perth and Christchurch and the fine, hot capital of Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby, which will play host to three Tests in the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. And it should be really quite good. Unless you\u2019d like to see a decent game in Sydney. In which case, you get stiffed. Well, not entirely. The Lebanon versus Australia pool game at Allianz Stadium should be pretty good, if a tad one-sided. And England versus Lebanon at the same venue should be full of backpackers and local Lebanese league types, and \u2026 yes, it also should be quite good. But they\u2019re not exactly marquee match-ups. Sydney people, who for so long have taken it for granted that world class events would lob in their lap simply by dint of the city\u2019s population, have been awarded just two, relatively innocuous pool games. And there\u2019s been some navel-gazing about it. Yet what do you expect, oh gleaming, Emerald City? It\u2019s Sydney\u2019s fault. People don\u2019t travel. There are eastern suburbs types who only half-joke about not going west of Anzac Parade and folks on the northern beaches who claim they never cross the Spit Bridge. Only the most rusted-on fans will leave their suburban pods and venture out into the night to sit in traffic and pay huge overs for parking, and then sit in traffic again, and get home at midnight, and experience all the other myriad annoyances that make it a pain to watch live sport in Sydney. But you can\u2019t blame them. The transport infrastructure is terrible. The Olympic-sized mega-dome is a soulless boulevard of broken dreams. And the denizens have so many more world-class entertainment options \u2013 including live coverage on the box. And thus, even in a city of 4.29 million people, World Cup organisers couldn\u2019t guarantee that ANZ Stadium would be full for the final. How can that be? Other cities have been chosen to host the premier fixtures \u2013 Darwin will host a quarter-final, so will Christchurch. Hamilton has 150,000 people and as many matches as Sydney. Cairns and Townsville have one more each. Melbourne and Brisbane have the semis. And the latter, capital of the state ever more considered the \u201cheartland\u201d of league in Australia, has the final at its brilliant Suncorp Stadium. And that is as it should be. And Sydney will have to get used to the fact that important people don\u2019t consider spending money to lure such games to Sydney to be a good use of tax-payers\u2019 money. The investment doesn\u2019t warrant the return. And here we are, again, rolling about in another of rugby league\u2019s surprisingly news-worthy \u201cvenues and scheduling\u201d imbroglios. What is it about these things that gets folks so het-up? There is an argument that a game should have gone to Sydney\u2019s west. Penrith chief executive Corey Payne wrote that he is \u201cextremely disappointed that we have been snubbed by the NRL for \u2018commercial reasons\u2019\u201d. Payne contends that not taking a Test match to Penrith is \u201ca mind-boggling decision which makes me question the NRL\u2019s strategic agenda for Australia\u2019s fastest growing economy and population\u201d. \u201cOur backyard is the growth engine of Australia, a burgeoning infrastructure capital and home to the third largest economy in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe region is a showpiece for multiculturalism in Australia.\u201d And all that may be true. But they rarely fill Penrith\u2019s stadium for matches featuring Penrith. And \u201ccommercial reasons\u201d are a pretty big marker in commercial sport. And, again, what does Sydney expect? Game three of rugby league\u2019s ultimate showcase, State of Origin, attracted but 61,000. And that was considered quite a few considering it was cold and a dead rubber, and played at ANZ. But it was far from full. And if you have a World Cup final that\u2019s far from full it would not be a \u201cgood look\u201d. And rugby league\u2019s marketeers would hate that. It leaves them open to hurtful teasing from their rivals for Australians\u2019 entertainment expenditure. What? You can\u2019t fill the stadium for the World Cup final of your sport? What is wrong with you, rugby league? And thus the final will be in Brisbane\u2019s Suncorp Stadium. And it will be full. And it\u2019ll be great there. And Sydney can suck it up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
