There are many unforgettable ingredients in Working Girl: the hair, the shoulder pads, the copious shots of Griffith in stockings and suspenders. But arguably the pivotal moment in the film is the scene in which our heroine, resplendent in a velvet cocktail dress, purrs: \"I've got a mind for business, and a bod for sin.\" The essential message is that Griffith, while blessed with the business acumen to make it to the very best seat in the boardroom, has not let it compromise her essential femininity (and, dubiously, her screwability). This is in sharp contrast to Weaver, a devious, idea-poaching sort, intent on remaining the only woman in the upper echelons of the Petty Marsh corporation. This week, Working Girl crawled into our thoughts again, as two separate events prompted us to wonder precisely what it takes, these days, for a woman to make it to the top in the business world? Balls, brains, or bods for sin? First, the case of Claire Bright, until last October one of the most senior women at HBOS plc, responsible for handling a budget of \u00a3140m. Bright is now suing the company for \u00a311m, claiming unfair dismissal following a complaint she made about her boss, Cliff Pattenden, whom she described as having an \"egotistical and mercurial character\" and a \"boorish and undermining\" management style. While it could be written off as a simple clash of personalities, at the heart of this case is the issue of gender in the business world. After Bright's recruitment, Pattenden described her as \"ballsy, arrogant, in your face, direct\", which he asserted \"would not work well here\". Bright now claims that the bank's response \"to a male who is abrasive, rude and confrontational is to accept these features as positive and do nothing about them. In a female, they are seen as wholly negative and the senior male executives respond by 'smoothing things over'.\" In summation, Bright maintains that Pattenden put her down because he \"could not manage a clever and successful woman\". Elsewhere this week, the final of the TV reality series The Apprentice saw a showdown between two female contestants, Ruth Badger and Michelle Dewberry. The women displayed notably different business styles - Badger was forthright and ballsy, while Dewberry was written off by many for her seeming timidity. In the end it was Dewberry who triumphed, and will now begin a \u00a3100,000-a-year post with Sugar. \"It shows you don't need to be loud and cocky and bolshie,\" she said on her appointment. \"Just work as hard as you can and hopefully you will get on in life.\" Slim, blond and pretty, Dewberry is now, however, having to defend herself against allegations that she used her \"bod for sin\" to woo Sugar into appointing her. More than anything, the cases of Bright and Dewberry illustrate the extent to which we are still concerned with the issue of women's femininity in the workplace, rather than their ability to do the job. Dewberry is seemingly \"too feminine\" to succeed, Bright \"too unfeminine\". It is a debate that rarely impinges on men's careers. \"These [ball-breaking] women are transgressing gender boundaries, behaving in ways that don't fit with conventional female behaviour. In the case of Claire Bright it's interesting that if she is behaving in this way, it has backfired for her massively,\" notes Helen McCarthy, a member of Thinkingwomen.org, a networking group for women. She notes that in the Apprentice, Sugar \"chose the younger, prettier, slightly more impressionable one, rather than the older, tougher woman. Perhaps she is less of a threat? Perhaps he felt he could mould her in his own image?\" McCarthy says she was \"shocked\" to read of the Bright case. \"HBOS has quite a good reputation for gender diversity,\" she explains. \"But it just goes to show that you can introduce as many gender diversity programmes as you like in an organisation but actually if the behaviour of the senior male executives is not in line with that it means nothing. You have to lead from the top.\" However, Laura Lewin, a business psychologist, is keen that we should not read too much into the HBOS case. \"The investment banking world is driven by the financial aspect to a much greater degree than many industries,\" she cautions. \"So it's not fair to extrapolate from that. There are some laggards, but I think we've moved well beyond the time when people thought women couldn't cut it in the workplace.\" Yet clever and successful women are scary. More scary than clever and successful men. And society's way of dealing with this fear is either to denigrate them for being too masculine or to suggest that they got ahead on looks alone. You are, it seems, either a Weaver or a Griffith; there is a conspicuous absence of a middle ground. But there are, maintain Lewin and McCarthy, ways to get ahead in the business world without your success being attributed to your feminine wiles, or your ball-breaking gutsiness. \"The key is being flexible; it's about your ability to interpret how others will respond,\" says Lewin. \"There are some situations where you could be required to be 'aggressive' whereas in other situations it could be inappropriate - whether for a man or a woman.\" And for McCarthy, the strategy is simple: \"Just be fantastically good at your job. That way you can't be faulted\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
