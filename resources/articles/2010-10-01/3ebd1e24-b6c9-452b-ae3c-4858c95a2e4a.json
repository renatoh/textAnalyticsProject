How strange. Only a year ago the two 65,000-tonne monsters seemed to be the flavour of the month, the answer to protecting the long-term needs of a maritime trading nation. They would allow Britain to fulfil its international military obligations and project its force, we were told. Now the story has changed radically. Senior figures in the US military profess themselves to be equally perplexed about the original decision to order two carriers. Questions which should have been asked years ago are only today being addressed. Against whom would this awesome maritime force be projected? The two carriers would be blown out of the water in the first exchanges of a conventional war against China. But then there were all those jobs saved at Rosyth and on the Clyde \u2013 10,000 frontline jobs and thousands more in the supply chain. Gordon Brown may have been acting politically rather than thinking strategically by signing the copper-bottomed contracts in the dying days of his regime. But anyone who thought that the last Labour government's refusal to take hard decisions over the defence budget would be rectified by the coalition's defence review will today be sorely disappointed. There will be no carrier at sea with British jets on it for the next 10 years as a result of the decision to decommission the Ark Royal and retire the Harrier jump jet. One of the new carriers will have no aircraft on it for at least three years, while costing \u00a31bn a year, and will then be mothballed or sold, and the second carrier will be adapted with catapults and arresting gear to take French and US planes. One bright day Britain will have both a carrier and planes to put on it, but not for some time yet. Even by the low standards of defence procurement, the continued muddle is madness. Rather than fashioning defence forces around real needs, Britain continues to pretend it is capable of providing the full spectrum of military roles. This was an opportunity to let just a chink of realism into the debate, and it was missed. If acting as an adjunct to the US military is paramount to British defence thinking, then there are three things the US military could use from Britain, one glamorous and two somewhat less so: British special forces, more heavy lift aircraft, and refuelling tankers. America does not need two more British carriers, more battle tanks, and heavy artillery. If, as we have consistently argued, Britain should pool its military resources with France and the rest of Europe, a range of other opportunities come into play. As it is, we are left with a force structure which suits no one, meeting neither US nor European nor British security needs. Professor Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute called it a slightly eccentric force structure. Paul Cornish, his counterpart at Chatham House, said the review had been indecision-led. Neither was exaggerating. Not all decisions announced by David Cameron yesterday were bad. CND welcomed his decision to reduce Britain's stockpile of nuclear weapons by 25%. The delay in the decision to start construction of new submarines to replace the Vanguard class which carry the Trident nuclear deterrent is also welcome \u2013 but only as a precursor to scrapping these weapons, which even Tony Blair now acknowledges can never be used independently. It was also important that a British prime minister recognised that this country will not be capable of fighting another war like Iraq, by committing himself to a maximum overseas deployment force of 30,000 troops \u2013 two-thirds of the number which took part in the invasion. But this is only the start of what should be a protracted and radical look at our real defence needs. On present form, it will be neither."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
