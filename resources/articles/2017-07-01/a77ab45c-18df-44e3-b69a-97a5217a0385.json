Downing Street files released on Thursday show how Major tried to sweeten the pill with a handwritten note decrying \u201churtful\u201d press attempts to make \u201cembarrassing\u201d comparisons between the two of them and telling her that the Soviet premier, Mikhail Gorbachev, was keen to invite her to a dinner in her honour in Moscow. The letter to Thatcher was written on 19 March 1991, two days before Major officially announced his plans to replace the poll tax, which had ignited a Trafalgar Square riot. To pour salt into the wound, the property-based council tax replacement was largely devised by Michael Heseltine who, more than anyone else, had brought about her downfall. Major confirmed, just five months after the unpopularity of the poll tax had sealed Thatcher\u2019s defeat in the November 1990 Tory leadership contest, that there was \u201ctangible and growing resentment\u201d among Conservative voters. They were being asked to foot the bill for the scale of unpaid poll tax which it \u201chad proved beyond the capability of even well-run authorities to collect in full\u201d. The cabinet papers for 1991, released by the National Archives at Kew on Thursday, also show that Major, as had been the case for Thatcher before him, needed to be sent a reminder by Westminster council to register for the poll tax, or community charge as it was officially known. They also reveal that when he was chancellor, it was the Treasury \u2013 and not Major himself \u2013 who had paid the poll tax second home \u201cstandard charge\u201d due on his No 11 Downing Street flat. The papers show Major tried to reassure Thatcher privately that he was trying to retain her poll tax principle that \u201cmost people should make some contribution\u201d while linking it to ability to pay. However, his political advisers, Jonathan Hill and Sarah Hogg, were urging him to drop any talk of the \u201cpersonal element living on\u201d and instead be \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that \u201cthe poll tax is stone dead.\u201d It is notable that in his five-page \u201cDear Margaret\u201d letter Major avoids any mention of the officially forbidden \u201cpoll tax\u201d phrase. His energy secretary at the time, John Wakeham, told Major the instant description had been part of the problem \u2013 \u201cAssociating the word tax (bad) with poll (good) was a fatal trap\u201d \u2013 the papers show. Instead Major focused on telling Thatcher that nobody had envisaged annual bills of \u00a3400 on its introduction or that it would \u201cprove very much more difficult to collect than we imagined\u201d. It was particularly difficult to maintain an up-to-date register of everyone liable, he explained. \u201cIt has proved beyond the capability of even well-run authorities to collect the tax in full. The result has been that responsible citizens, overwhelmingly our supporters, are being asked to make good the shortfall from non-payers. As this becomes more and more apparent and the shortfall increases from year to year, resentment is bound to grow: indeed it is already a tangible issue,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe decision to abolish the community charge was not taken lightly. But, having consulted widely throughout the party, I am convinced that it would never be accepted as equitable and that it would never be properly collectable either. I do not think we could long defend a situation in which some people were paying more in community charge than in income tax.\u201d Before signing off, Major tried to soften the blow by telling Thatcher that Gorbachev had said during a recent Moscow visit how much \u201che had always enjoyed his talks to you. He hopes very much that you and Denis will pay an early visit to the Soviet Union\u201d. Major mentioned that a formal invitation, including a dinner in her honour, would soon be issued. But he did not leave it there. Perhaps conscious that just days before Thatcher had been publicly quoted accusing him of \u201cundermining her legacy\u201d, he tried to mollify her by adding a handwritten note saying: \u201cI am as fed up as you must be with the way the press seize on any issue to try and point up similarities/dis-similarities between us. I find it embarrassing and, more important, you must find it hurtful.\u201d There is no immediate reply from Thatcher recorded in the file but in his 1999 autobiography Major admitted the poll tax was her \u201cmost treasured policy\u201d: \u201cAt the time the poll tax was the most vital policy issue facing me as prime minister. This was partly because it was, at base, all about Margaret Thatcher and her legacy.\u201d There is little evidence she was convinced. A year later, when the second volume of her memoirs was published, it included the withering judgment on her anointed successor that there was no such thing as Majorism: \u201cI don\u2019t accept the idea that all of a sudden Major is his own man,\u201d she wrote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
