The information and communications technology organisation\u2019s event, International Women\u2019s Day 2014: Celebrate the male champions of change!, sparked a backlash after inviting people to the RACV club in Melbourne to \u201cjoin us in celebrating this day by acknowledging those men in our lives who are champions of change\u201d. The invitation also suggested guests bring along a \u201cmale champion of change\u201d to add to the conversation. Promotion of the event included a quote from ANZ CEO Mike Smith. \u201cIt strikes me that we need to celebrate men who have a track record of hiring, developing and advancing women \u2013 but actually these men are quite rare.\u201d Smith made the statement in his address at a November 2013 meeting of Male Champions of Change \u2013 a collaboration, launched in 2010 by sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick, of 21 business, government and military leaders, working to \u201cachieve significant and sustainable increases in the representation of women in leadership in Australia\u201d. Reaction on Twitter included accusations of sexism, as well as being condescending and patronising, but Broderick defended Smith\u2019s quote. \u201cMike is a very active champion of change who advocates strongly for women\u2019s leadership in [Australia] and globally,\u201d she wrote. In response to the barrage of negative feedback, the ACS released a statement from branch chair Michelle Beveridge apologising \u201cfor any offence this has caused\u201d and the event was quickly re-themed \u201ccelebrating diversity\u201d. \u201cWe always planned to celebrate diversity in line with the 2014 IWD theme of inspiring change,\u201d said Beveridge. \u201cFollowing strong public feedback, we\u2019ve changed our event to make it absolutely clear that our focus on International Women\u2019s Day is celebrating diversity and inspiring change.\u201d Jo Dalvean, management committee member of the ACS, told Guardian Australia the ACS \u201ccould have chosen our words better\u201d but defended the original theme of the breakfast. \u201cThe ACS has a long and proud history of encouraging diversity in the ICT profession. In 2014 we have our first female president, and 30% of our directors are female, well above the industry average. We believe that employers, be they men or women, who encourage diversity should be celebrated, and that was, and remains, our intent,\u201d she said. \u201cOn March 7 we will celebrate diversity in ICT by highlighting the extraordinary contribution of women in ICT, alongside recognising those men who are breaking down the barriers so that gender imbalances can be addressed.\u201d The new event is now going ahead with presenters Andrew Walduck, CIO of Australia Post, Jane Treadwell, CEO of DesignGov, and Dr Sandy Caspi Sable, owner of Satellite Consulting Services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
