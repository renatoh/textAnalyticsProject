The 2015-16 PFA Player of the Year ran the show from start to finish against Sheffield United, providing the assist for Jamie Vardy\u2019s winning goal in the second half as Leicester reached the sixth round of the FA Cup for the first time since 2011. On this evidence, with Mahrez and Vardy linking up in a manner that was at times reminiscent of their title-winning season, they will be a stiff test for whoever they are drawn against in the next round as Leicester attempt to win this competition for the first time in their history having been beaten in the final on four previous occasions. Claude Puel, who took Southampton to the EFL Final last season before being unceremoniously dumped, was not looking that far ahead yet, although this does represent their best opportunity to return to European competition after reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League last season. \u201cIt was a good feeling to see Jamie and Riyad playing together on the same pitch again,\u201dsaid Puel. \u201cNow we move on. It\u2019s behind us. He came back with his quality and created the goal against a difficult opponent. We will see what happens but it is an objective. We need to stay ambitious and see what the draw brings.\u201d Guardiola\u2019s attempt to sign Mahrez on the final day of the transfer window angered the usually mild-mannered Frenchman to such an extent that he accused the Premier League leaders of showing a lack of respect earlier this week. City insist that they first approached Leicester a whole week before the end of January but it has undoubtedly been a distraction to the manager and his players. Last week\u2019s 5-1 hammering at the Etihad Stadium in which Mahrez came on as a second-half substitute followed the home draw with Swansea and defeat at Everton, meaning Leicester had not tasted victory since thrashing Peterborough in the previous round of this competition. The announcement of the Algerian\u2019s name before kick-off was greeted with a smattering of boos, although the response from a depleted home crowd was generally supportive. Their opponents also made six changes from their last league outing, with Chris Wilder perhaps mindful of the three crucial Championship fixtures in the space of seven days coming up next week. The Blades have lost their way in recent months following a blistering start to the season and now sit three points behind the play-off places. Setting out with a rigid five-man defence was an indication that they were here to contain their opponents for as long as possible. With Mahrez causing problems from his starting position on the right flank, they just about did enough to keep the scores level in the first half. Jamie Vardy\u2019s effort from Wilfred Ndidi\u2019s precise through-ball was blocked by the impressive Jack O\u2019Connell, while another attempt from the England striker just curled wide of the far post after good work from Demarai Gray. At the other end Leicester were thankful for Harry Maguire\u2019s alertness when a poor clearing header from Danny Simpson fell at the feet of Enda Stevens. The defender, who was a ballboy at Bramall Lane before coming through the youth system, reacted quickly to fling himself in front of the ball and save a certain goal. Vardy, who is also from Sheffield but grew up supporting Wednesday, should have given his side the lead soon after, following a slide-rule pass from Mahrez, but he could not find a way past the goalkeeper, Jamal Blackman. Leicester continued to dominate proceedings after the break, albeit without creating any clear chances to break the deadlock despite the best efforts of Mahrez. That changed in the 66th minute, though, when he picked up the ball on the right touchline. A twisting and turning run that left his marker, George Baldock, bamboozled eventually won him the space to deliver a deep cross to the back post which Vardy did well to loop over the helpless Blackman. The goalkeeper then made amends with a brilliant save from Gray to keep United in the tie, while his counterpart Kasper Schmeichel also had to be at his best to deny Baldock. Vardy had the ball in the net for a second time, only for the assistant to rule that Mahrez had been fractionally offside when he cushioned a header across goal. That would have sealed their progress to the next round but instead Leicester were forced to dig deep against opponents who suddenly fancied their chances of forcing a replay. The hosts stood firm however and there was not a Leicester fan in the house who did not get up to applaud when Mahrez left the pitch in injury time. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed but they had a strong side out,\u201d admitted Wilder. \u201cWe tried to hit them on the counter but a lot of things have got to go right for you if you\u2019re going to win somewhere like here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
