The lure is the sense of freedom - from lift queues, fellow skiers, and the necessity of lengthy, occasionally humiliating tuition. It is easy to get the hang of - the basics can be learned in a couple of hours - and trails tend to be well marked, making it appealing to independent-minded types who don't want to be part of a group. Practitioners also tend to have very firm thighs, for cross-country skiing is a famously good aerobic activity. Here's our pick of where to try it: Best for learners Seefeld, near Innsbruck, is Austria's leading cross-country resort with 250 kilometres of marked trails and lots of enthusiastic locals. For \u00a387 you get three days of two-hour lessons, plus equipment hire for a week. If you hate it, the atmospheric car-free village has lots of downhill skiing too. If you need a break from skiing altogether, there are plenty of pavement cafes, an embarrassment of cake shops and a casino. \u00b7 Prices from \u00a3407 per week, including flights, transfers and half-board with Inghams (020 8780 4433; www.inghams.co.uk) Best for city slickers Quebec, the French-Canadian capital, is a Francophone delight, with trams, cobbled streets and some of the best food in North America - and no city embraces cross-country skiing more. Many trails start in the centre and 40km away on Route 440, the Mont-Sainte-Anne Nordic Center has 223km of trails, making it the largest cross-country ski resort in Canada. Those wanting to get off the beaten track should head to the wildlife reserve of the Laurentians - reachable by bus - and Camp Mercier, a wooded area blessed by heavy snow. \u00b7 Prices from \u00a31,450pp including flights, half-board accommodation transfers and a guide with Waymark (01753 516477; www.waymarkholidays.com) Best for children The thought of meeting Father Christmas probably counts as the ultimate exercise bribe and the Finns have spent years convincing us, and themselves, that Finnish Lapland is actually the North Pole. You can go skiing there with Inghams on 10, 17 or 25 December and dinner with the great white bearded one comes as part of the package. There are 230km of trails around the town of Levi, making it suitable for different levels of expertise and stamina. \u00b7 Prices start at \u00a3502pp including flights, transfers and half-board accommodation for a week in January with Inghams (020 8780 4433; www.inghams.co.uk). A day-long course in cross-country techniques costs \u00a3127, including a week's boot and ski hire Best for isolation Norway varies its cross-country skiing with both short valley circuits and networks of long, gently undulating, trails interspersed with refuges - some manned, some self-catering - where skiers can refuel. The northern part of Norway, with the towering peaks of the Jotunheimen mountains and the Rondane National Park, provided inspiration for Ibsen and Grieg's Peer Gynt. \u00b7 Prices from \u00a3663pp including return flights from Heathrow to Oslo, transfers and seven nights half-board accommodation with Inntravel (01653 617906; www.inntravel.co.uk) Best for daytrips The Snowdome at Tamworth in Staffordshire houses Britain's only indoor cross-country snow circuit, a 200m undulating track covered in snow year round. There's even a Midlands Nordic Ski Club and Santa is currently in residence too. \u00b7 A two-hour session costs \u00a310 for adults and \u00a37 for juniors (08705 000011; www.snowdome.co.uk)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
