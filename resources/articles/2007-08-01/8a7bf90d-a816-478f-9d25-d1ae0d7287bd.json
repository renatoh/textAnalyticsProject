But first the 26-year-old will attempt to win the two races in the British round of the World Superbike series on his Ten Kate Honda at Brands Hatch on Sunday as he seeks to clinch his second world title in a championship in which he has competed for seven years. \"The easy decision would be to stay in World Superbike and keep winning,\" he said. \"But this is about the next step and the next challenge. We have not had a British rider on top in MotoGP since the late, great Barry Sheene. I won't lie down until I have achieved that.\" Herv\u00e9 Poncharal of Yamaha said: \"I am delighted to have secured a rider of James's calibre and am looking forward to working with him. It is an exciting time for us all and I am certain that he will be an integral part of the team's future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
