OK, it wasn't the world's biggest surprise that once again you voted Green &amp; Black's chocolate as the best organic product, but you did hunt out the less well-known names, too, such as the winner of our best Sunday lunch, a Devon hotel where pigs, ducks and geese roam on certified organic land before turning up on the menu, and Lounge Lover, our bar of the year tucked away in the backstreets of London's East End. And thank you for telling us about the Gourmet Burger Kitchen, a chain set up by a group of enthusiastic New Zealanders passionate about creating a burger to be proud of. They carried off our Cheap Eats award. This year's restaurant of the year is Anthony's in Leeds. Run by a 24-year-old chef and his relatives, Anthony's was praised as much for its warm family atmosphere as for its signature white onion risotto, served with a slick of bitter coffee and topped off by parmesan foam. (You might guess I didn't vote on that one.) But there are two winners I am especially thrilled to see getting their dinner gongs, the glorious La Fromagerie in London at which I have been an almost daily customer since the day it opened its doors and the Wolseley which this year picks up the award for the best breakfast. Congratulations to everyone involved. Together with your votes for books, shops and TV programmes, you have given us the chance to recognise those who have made a real difference this year. We didn't let you get your own way over everything though, and brought in a panel of pros to argue about some of the categories: last year's Hall of Fame winner, dinner lady Jeanette Orrery, Ruthie Rogers, Rick Stein, Gordon Ramsay, Heston Blumenthal and Jay Rayner all (well, mostly) agreed that this year's Best Newcomer is Leon, a tiny fast food takeaway in London's Carnaby Street (possibly the only shop on the street that doesn't sell trainers) run by Allegra McEvedy and Henry Dimbleby (son of cookery writer Jossie). Leon received praise for its reasonably priced salads, grilled vegetables, Cajun fish and lamb meatballs. Now we want a whole chain of them, please. And while I am on the subject of meat, huge congratulations to Tim Wilson and everyone at the Ginger Pig, the farm and butcher's shop that wins our best producer award. There is nothing quite like the Pig, a shop where you can gaze with awe at the hand-raised pork pies produced in the on-site kitchen. Anyone who has eaten the Ginger Pig's giant sausage rolls might also like to know that its pork chops are just as fine. This year's Hall of Fame award goes to Hugh Pennington. A professor of bacteriology (he retired from Aberdeen university last year), Hugh is best known for his work on both the E.coli outbreak in Lanarkshire and the BSE crisis. A justly deserved award. Thanks to everyone who voted. Your vote makes so much difference to so many; not just to the places that win, but to all the people involved behind the scenes, who put in both hours and energy for our pleasure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
