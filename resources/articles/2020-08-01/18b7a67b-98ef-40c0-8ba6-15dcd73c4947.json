As this episode begins, they\u2019re in sumptuous surroundings and clean clothes, generally appreciating the hell out of their unexpectedly luxurious lodgings. That\u2019s a pretty jarring tone-shift, but perhaps a point is being made about the carpe diem attitude adopted by people who live in constant danger? Or perhaps something altogether more sinister is going on \u2026? Tic is the only one still brooding on the shoggoth-sherriff attack and is already deeply suspicious when William gives them the house tour, pointing to a portrait of \u201cArdham\u2019s founder and the original owner of the lodge, Titus Braithwaite\u201d, an unnervingly KKK-looking chap in a hood. William explains that Titus made his fortune in \u201cshipping\u201d, which, as Leti hisses in George\u2019s ear, is clearly \u201ccode for slavery\u201d. More suspicious still, the car that Leti totalled last episode has turned up looking brand new in the Braithwaite\u2019s garage, and there\u2019s no possibility of calling Montrose to verify his whereabouts because, apparently, present owner Samuel Braithwaite never installed telephone lines. So while Leti and George seem content to enjoy some respite after their long road trip, we\u2019re surely with Tic when he insists the whole thing is very, very hinky. \u201cWhen have you ever shown up to a white man\u2019s house uninvited and he didn\u2019t try to get you out in 2.5 seconds?\u201d It\u2019s like, guys, have you not seen the Oscar-winning 2017 movie Get Out or something? Seriously, just get out! They do, eventually, but only for a preprandial stroll around the village. It\u2019s a creepy little medieval-style settlement, complete with children-of-the-corn types dancing round a maypole and a stone tower filled with pigs heads, which \u2013 George deduces \u2013 is where Montrose has been imprisoned. It\u2019s guarded by a woman in a straw hat (Jamie Neumann, whom viewers of The Deuce will recognise). She informs them that the tower is used not as a prison, but to secure the town\u2019s food supply. \u201cNo grizzlies, just black bears. But the blacks are bad enough \u2026\u201d she says, before embarking on the most cutesily extended racist metaphor since Enid Blyton put down her pen. On their return journey through the woods, George recalls that Dora\u2019s \u201cgreat ancestor was a slave named Hannah\u201d who \u201cescaped her master\u2019s house after a fire\u201d. A fire. Y\u2019know, like the one William told them burned down the original lodge house in 1832, killing \u201calmost\u201d everyone in it? The same Titus who was \u201cnotoriously kind to his servants\u201d, ie raped them, possibly impregnating them (\u201cWhy is my mother telling you stuff that she never told either me or my father?\u201d Tic wants to know. Good question Tic, good question). While they\u2019re stood there, shoggoths attack and Christina Braithwaite (Abbey Lee) comes riding to the rescue on horseback. This is the same willowy blonde last seen driving to the rescue behind the wheel of silver Bentley. Back at the house, Tic is finally introduced to Samuel Braithwaite (Tony Goldwyn) who greets him with the words: \u201cYou\u2019re darker than I expected,\u201d thus proving there\u2019s always time to squeeze in an extra lil\u2019 microaggression, even during the commission of your macro-aggression. Is Christina any better than her pops? She\u2019d certainly like Tic to think so, telling him: \u201cYou should think about making some friends; not all us white folks are out to get you.\u201d (Christina definitely just posted a black square on her Insta in June and called it a day, didn\u2019t she?) Tic responds by sharpening up her loose definition of allyship: \u201cYou want to be friends, fine, but that\u2019s gonna take actions, not just promises.\u201d With George and Leti\u2019s memories returned, Tic is no longer out on his own. Not that this fosters much solidarity in the short term. Each is confined to his or her own quarters having their own Solaris-style encounters with projections from their own psyches. (This episode is titled Whitey on the Moon after Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s 1970 spoken-word poem, and that\u2019s not the only nod to space exploration.) George slow dances with his old flame Dora, AKA Tic\u2019s mum (Erica Tazel); Tic engages in hand-to-hand combat with a female Korean soldier and Leti gets intimate with Tic \u2013 or-is-it? Slowly the pieces are coming together: Samuel is a cultist, a \u201cSon of Adam\u201d, who intends to spill Tic\u2019s Titus-descended blood as a means to attain eternal life. The three manage to orchestrate an escape, rescue Montrose (Cooeee, Michael K Williams! Glad you could join us!) from the tower and speed off in the silver Bentley only to come crashing into an invisible wall. The Braithwaites then drag them all back to the house once again, with both Leti and George sustaining potentially fatal gunshot wounds. (Christina again does diddly squat to help. So much for your allyship, babes.) It\u2019s not really clear why Leti is miraculously healed, while George is left to die? Nevertheless, a deathbed George is a chatty George and his passionate pleading with Montrose all-but confirms what\u2019s already been hinted at: he may be Tic\u2019s real father, a secret known only to the brothers \u2013 and Dora of course, but she\u2019s dead. Soon George is dead too, but is he dead-dead? One of Lovecraft\u2019s most famous stories is about a \u201creanimator\u201d, so here\u2019s hoping Uncle George finds his way back to us. Additional notes In the comments last week, genlob used the Whovian \u201ccompanions\u201d to refer to Leti, Tic and George, which made me realise we\u2019re lacking a collective term. The Scooby Gang is already taken, any other suggestions? Christina should offer a short course in shoggoth husbandry. Evidently they make good guard dog-like family pets, but do they always gestate in a cow\u2019s uterus? Is a shoggoth bite always fatal? The last thing Dora\u2019s ghost says to George before she disappears is: \u201cYou could actually fly with your children.\u201d Interesting choice of plural \u2026 The Prince Hall Freemasonry branch that George says he belongs to was founded in 1784 and survives today. Notable members have included Al Green, Jesse Jackson and Sugar Ray Robinson. Reading list \u201c[Algernon] Blackwood, [William Hope] Hodgson, Clark Ashton Smith \u2026\u201d These are the authors that George finds in his personalised library, all good additions to your post-Lovecraft reading list. The House on the Borderland (1908) by Hodgson is the book that opens the secret library to George. Necronomicon, or the \u201cbook of dead names\u201d that Montrose refers to isn\u2019t actually a real book \u2013 unless you count the 2008 collection of Lovecraft\u2019s short stories published under that title. It\u2019s a \u201cgrimoire\u201d invented by by Lovecraft in his 1924 story The Hound. Listening guide Movin On Up, by Ja\u2019net DuBois, the jubilant song that Leti and George dance around to while \u201cfreshening up\u201d, has a particular resonance for US TV viewers of a certain vintage. It was the theme tune to the groundbreaking African American sitcom The Jeffersons. Morning Ritual\u2019s 2014 cover of Bad Moon Rising appears here, but the Creedence Clearwater Revival original was released in 1969 (the year of the moon landing, of course) and was supposedly inspired when John Fogerty watched the 1941 film adaptation of the 1936 short story The Devil and Daniel Webster, by Lovecraft contemporary Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t. Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s Whitey on the Moon critiqued the US space programme in the context of black American poverty back on Earth. Is there a comparison with the Sons of Adam spilling a black man\u2019s blood to make their own bid for immortality? River by Leon Bridges provides the moving soundtrack for this episode\u2019s final scene. A Bridges-performed cover of Whitey on The Moon also appears prominently in the 2018 film First Man. Tic &amp; Leti lovewatch Ever since Tic frolicked by the burst fire hydrant and Leti bent over in her pink peddle-pushers, it\u2019s been obvious these two hotties are gonna get it on. But when? Tic and Leti shippers got close this episode, but then Leti let a little case of viper-penis put her off. That and the fact that Tic wasn\u2019t actually Tic, but rather a demonic apparition. Fussy, or what? Quote of the week \u201cIt seems the KKK aren\u2019t just calling themselves \u2018grand wizards\u2019 any more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
