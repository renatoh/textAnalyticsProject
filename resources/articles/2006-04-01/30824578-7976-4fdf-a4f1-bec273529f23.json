If Mara Yamauchi is any guide, it has other benefits too. The woman who, in the absence of the world record holder Paula Radcliffe, will line up for the London Marathon on Sunday as Britain's leading runner, is on a diet that includes hijiki (black seaweed), natto (fermented soya beans), green seaweed and mochi, rice cakes that she consumes as a pre-race boost. \"Japan has loads of great female marathon runners, so there must be something in it,\" said Yamauchi, who is taking a Japanese cookery course. Her love for Japanese food developed when she was posted by the Foreign Office to work in the British Embassy in Tokyo. Among the jobs she undertook were trying to convince the local media before the 2002 World Cup that not all England football fans were hooligans and translating for Baroness Thatcher. There she also met Shige, whom she married in 2003. Yamauchi had put her promising running career, which as Mara Myers included winning the English cross- country title in 1998, on hold while working in Tokyo but she made a comeback to try - in the end unsuccessfully - to qualify for the 2004 Olympics. \"When we got married I told Shige I would see if I could get to Athens and then give up,\" she said. \"But I carried on.\" Yamauchi is currently on an unpaid sabbatical from the Foreign Office until after the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and the Harrow runner has improved by more than four minutes in the last two years, culminating in her running 2hr 27min 38sec to finish fifth in the Tokyo Marathon last November. The loss of Radcliffe to a toe injury has focused a lot more attention on Yamauchi than she had expected. \"Paula is such a fantastic athlete and it's very frustrating that she won't be running,\" she said. \"I've been injured myself and I know how difficult that can be. It's a shame she's not here. But I have my own goals. I will be really happy to break 2:25, although 2:26 is probably more realistic. London is a fast course, so I hope I can do it.\" A run inside 2:26 will move Yamauchi to third on the United Kingdom all-time list behind Radcliffe and Liz McColgan, both world champions, and the confident runner bridled at suggestions by Tim Hutchings, London's international race director, that at 32 she is old. \"It's not that old for a marathon runner,\" she said. Yamauchi is coached by Bob Parker, a 76-year-old who has worked with David Bedford, the former world 10,000 metres record holder who is now the race director of the London Marathon. Since she returned to Tokyo in January the two have communicated by telephone. \"She's a good girl,\" Parker said. \"She's a really hard worker. She won't be afraid of going with them on Sunday. She's not afraid of pain.\" Marathon runners are more revered in Japan than anywhere in the world. \"Japan is really crazy about the marathon,\" said Yamauchi. \"They really appreciate hard work, application and working towards something over time. Those are qualities that really lend themselves to the marathon.\" Yamauchi has already earned reward this year for the 105 miles she runs in training each week. At the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne last month she won a surprise bronze medal in the 10,000m in a new personal best of 31min 49.40sec, beating the favourite, Benita Johnson of Australia. \"I had been worried about finishing last,\" she said. \"Before the Commonwealths I did much the same training I did before my previous marathon. I just added some shorter, faster track sessions and it seemed to work.\" It all points to a good performance on Sunday. But when she was asked how she would celebrate if she won, Yamauchi looked shocked. \"I haven't given that a moment's thought,\" she said. Whatever the celebration, though, it will probably involve something off a Japanese menu."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
