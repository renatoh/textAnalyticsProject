The Denman who pulverised the opposition in the 2008 Cheltenham Gold Cup had not yet surfaced in last month's renewal. But in finishing second behind Kauto Star, the nine-year-old brings the best form to the table in this afternoon's totesport Bowl. This Grade 2 chase was a race too far for Kauto Star after he had finished second in the Gold Cup last season, a result which still irks trainer Paul Nicholls, who admits he gave jockey Ruby Walsh the wrong orders. Denman's case differs from Kauto Star's, however. He had not peaked at Cheltenham last month, but was steadily finding his form after a spell on the sidelines following treatment for a fibrillating heart. Nicholls reports Denman to have thrived since then. If Denman (3.10) is beaten today, it may not be because of the sharper Mildmay course, but the ground. The word \"soft\" appears in the vast majority of Denman's 13 career wins but the Aintree track will be drying out rapidly. Albertas Run, a creditable second behind Kauto Star in the King George at Kempton on good ground, is one who could step up markedly on his Gold Cup form - he finished ninth - as he does better in small fields. Nicholls had five winners at this meeting last year and he could well get close to that today. Big Buck's (2.00), winner of the Mildmay Novice Chase 12 months ago, has been a revelation since switching to hurdles. Mighty Man, fifth to Big Buck's in the World Hurdle at Cheltenham, is capable of getting a lot closer on a course where he is unbeaten in three appearances. But after breaking down at Punchestown nearly two years ago, it is expecting a lot of Henry Daly's stayer to reverse Cheltenham form with the winner. Hebridean (2.35) and Chapoturgeon (4.55) are other strong contenders for the powerful Nicholls team. Chapoturgeon was on a good mark in the Jewson Chase at Cheltenham but, in trotting up by nine lengths, he showed form on a par with the Arkle Trophy, in which Planet Of Sound was third."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
