You've got the goal there and you've got two players and if one player has the ball and dribbles it past them, I think they're offside. I'm not too sure. Chris Lyons, 28, steel fitter It's the last line of defence. You've got your defenders and the attacking team is running along. The defenders normally try to stay in a line and push further forward to allow the attacking player to get past that, and once he is past that line and the ball is passed, he will be classed offside. That's the best way I can describe it. But I play rugby. Neville Marshall, 27, labourer It's when the striker is behind the defenders when the ball is played in. If he was level with the defenders he wouldn't be offside. How many defenders need to be in front? Any number, it doesn't matter. Not in a sexist way, but say you were in a shop buying a handbag. OK, OK, say you were in a shop buying a hammer. If I was in front of you, if someone comes in to pay the money I'd be offside but if I was level with you I'd still be onside. That's how I explain it to my girlfriend. Karl Marshall-Nichols, 21, painter and decorator It's where the defenders . . . The goalie is there, and the defenders have to be there [in front]. You can be offside but as long as the ball is played before you're in the offside position you're fine. Can you be offside from a corner? I don't know. From a goal kick? No. I think. I don't know. Dan Pickard, 34, consultant It's something to do with you must be onside while passing the ball and while the ball is in flight you're allowed to run offside. What's onside? Having a defender between you and the keeper. Only one defender. Or is it two? It's a rubbish game anyway. Oliver Emmanuel, 30, works for a rail company I have no idea. I watch football from time to time but not all of us make football our life and know every rule. Geoff Coombs, 64, retired teacher Do you want to know about the changes in the offside law? This took place a few years ago, which means when the ball is played forward to you and you are interfering with play, you have to have two men between you and the goal line. If you are level with the second man you are now considered onside, previously you were considered offside. The other change is the interpretation of the offside law in what is meant by \"interfering with play\". I still remember the goal that was disallowed by Spurs against Arsenal when John White smashed the ball in and it would have been 5-4 to Spurs but Terry Dyson was given offside, but he was standing by the corner flag and was considered to be interfering with play. The main problem with the offside law is interpretation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
