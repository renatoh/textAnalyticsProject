He booked his place with a comfortable success in the Armstrong Memorial Rated Stakes over course and distance at Ripon yesterday. The Mick Channon-trained gelding, making a quick reappearance after finishing 11th in the Stewards' Cup at Goodwood on Saturday, was given a confident ride by Dean Corby. Corby had him travelling sweetly and once he asked him to quicken the response was immediate, with Budelli sweeping into the lead inside the final furlong and striding away to beat Artie by two and a half lengths. Channon was taking his score for the season to 80, and his representative Lesley White said: \"Budelli stumbled at the start in the Great St Wilfrid last year and he was only beaten a short head. \"I don't see any reason why he should not have another go. He is a tough horse who takes his racing and travelling well - and Dean [Corby] gets on very well with him.\" Apprentice Suzanne France showed that a horrific fall, in which she was very lucky to escape serious injury at Thirsk on Friday, had not dented her confidence when bringing Petite Mac with a perfectly-timed run to win the Kathryn Apanowicz Radio Show Selling Handicap by one length from Wittily. It was her fifth success, the other four having been gained on Efidium, and her boss Neville Bycroft, who retained Petite Mac without a bid, said: \"Suzanne said she let him down too soon last time but she said she learned from that and was very cool on him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
