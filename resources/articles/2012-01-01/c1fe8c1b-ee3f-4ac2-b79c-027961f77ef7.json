Trying to recreate the experience in the studio again, their second effort is somewhat more crafted than their first \u2013 if this were possible at 100mph. If anything, the machine-gun drumrolls and marauding metal riffs seem even faster, although the melodies are sharper, and one or two tuneful slower sections offer some calm before the storm. Gone are most of the bad puns (although Degeneration Game and the Ramonesy/Quo Bromance Ain't Dead are among the best tunes); Epic Myth and Night of the Living could be a metal Franz Ferdinand. It's still impossible to work out what they are screaming/shouting. \"Waltzing back to the dark place\" may be an actual lyric. \"Remove the vibration, come back in the Tate\" probably isn't. It's very loud and very snotty, although the 11 tracks are kind enough to irritate the neighbours for no longer than 32 minutes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
