The Government has agreed to cover the Games's debts with up to \u00a3100 million of taxpayers' money. An initial cash injection of over \u00a330m will be announced soon after the general election. The recent collapse of the plan to rebuild Wembley Stadium has helped persuade Ministers that the Games must succeed, especially as they are the centrepiece of the Queen's golden jubilee celebrations. 'Manchester simply will not be allowed to fail or become the latest great British sporting disaster,' said a government source. 'We will spend whatever it takes to ensure it succeeds.' Britain's reputation for sporting competence has taken a battering over the Wembley debacle, England's failure to win the race to stage the 2006 football World Cup, and the possibility that there may be no suitable venue to host the World Athletics Championships in London, due to be held at a new stadium in north London. About \u00a3150m of public money has already been spent on the Games, but most of that is Lottery funding to build world-class sports facilities to host events in 2002 and then become training centres for British athletes. Tony Blair, who has taken a keen personal interest in the Games, has approved the bail-out. It follows a review of the finances and organisation of the Games conducted by a ministerial group headed by Home Secretary Jack Straw. Members of the group have become increasingly alarmed at the growing hole in the event's finances. Sources say the final short fall could now be even more than the \u00a360m 'worst-case scenario' revealed by The Observer in February. Barely a third of the \u00a362m organisers claimed they would raise has been found. Critics say organisers were wildly unrealistic about the television revenue they would make. Only a fraction has been secured. Negative publicity about Wembley and the Millennium Dome has also deterred sponsors from getting involved in the event. The government money will be used to complete the main stadium, pay for a walkway between Piccadilly train station and the nearby Sport City venue, and to promote the event. Organisers fear their marketing budget is so small many people will not even know the event is happening. A big promotional push is planned in London and the south to ensure that the Games are seen as of national importance. Derek Wyatt, Labour candidate for Sittingbourne and Sheppey, who was on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee and is an ex-England rugby player, said: 'It's important for Britain's future in international sport that Manchester 2002 succeeds. If we have to spend \u00a350m of government money to make it a beacon event, it will be money well spent.'
