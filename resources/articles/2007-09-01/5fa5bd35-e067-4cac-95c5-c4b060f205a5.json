Closer to Stamford Bridge the mood was much different as former Chelsea players combined praise for Mourinho's achievements with fears about the implications of his departure. From the possibility of players following Mourinho out of the club to the negative effect in the dressing room and the complex chain of command at Stamford Bridge, David Speedie, Gavin Peacock and Nigel Spackman all found reasons to be pessimistic post-Mourinho. \"It's going to be difficult to fill Jose's shoes and to get the respect of the players,\" said Speedie. \"I can see a mass exodus, including the likes of Frank Lampard and John Terry, with them being unsettled and wanting to leave. I hope not, for the sake of Chelsea and the supporters, but it wouldn't surprise me. Jose wasn't just a manager, he was friends with the players. You never heard one bad word said against him from a player and that speaks volumes for a manager.\" Peacock shares similar worries. \"I really am concerned for Chelsea for this season,\" said the former Blues striker. \"I know the players are upset, I heard [Didier] Drogba was in tears. [Mourinho's] made them into winners, Terry and Lampard, Drogba - look what's happened to him - and Joe Cole, who has become a regular in the England team. All these players looked to Jose as their real leader and now they are left without that, and that can have a big, big effect on team morale.\" Spackman, who believes Mourinho \"will go down as a legend at the football club\", said the handling of experienced players holds the key. \"The big thing for Chelsea,\" he said, \"is to make sure that the senior players - John Terry, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and Petr Cech - are kept informed and they are happy with what's going on. That stems from the top with [owner] Roman Abramovich himself and [chief executive] Peter Kenyon. There has got to be harmony back in the camp.\" There has certainly been little harmony during the past 12 months, with Mourinho and Abramovich's struggle a perpetual theme. Peacock believes the arrival of chief scout Frank Arnesen and Avram Grant as director of football had a destabilising effect, with Spackman also recognising Mourinho's failure to provide the style of play Abramovich coveted. \"It's a fine line between being entertaining and being successful,\" he said. \"I don't think he has been able to quite get that right.\" Not that Mourinho, who has been replaced by Grant, will go down as failure. \"You will look at the record books and see that Jose Mourinho was the most successful manager in Chelsea's history - you can't take that away from him,\" said Spackman. His former Chelsea team-mate Speedie agreed. \"I think true Chelsea supporters and true Chelsea people who have played for the club see what he has done as absolutely outstanding - and it will be very difficult to better.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
