My personal caseload as a family magistrate is consistent with the average of 45 weeks stated in the article. It is too long. I would argue, however, that these delays are not primarily due to failings of the court itself. Care orders, allowing children to be removed from their parents, are life-changing instruments and courts must be satisfied that a case merits such draconian action. According to Barnardo's own research, reported in the piece, \"the longer a case goes on, the more likely it is that children will be subject to placement changes, multiple assessments, changes of social workers and complex family contact arrangements\". This is very true. Courts cannot grant a care order simply because a local authority wants one. Evidence must be gathered to enable an informed decision to be made. First impressions might point to a likely outcome, but we all know cases where the final outcome was very different to the first impression. Applications for care orders involve a series of hearings at which the court identifies and progressively gathers the evidence needed to make a final decision. Nothing is static; perspectives and the evidence needed may change as the case progresses. The court provides the venue, magistrates and judges manage the process and make the decisions; but the evidence comes from other parties and agencies who are involved in the case because they have responsibility, relevant knowledge or expertise. The process depends on them carrying out agreed work within set time scales and, if they don't, court hearings may have to be rescheduled. Each time that happens, the case end-date recedes. Why is this so when there are powerful sanctions, and people must do what the courts say? Well, we know that departments are stretched, that fresh crises arise, new work flows in and people are sick through stress. Social workers are crucial to a care order's progress and your readers need no reminding of the pressure on them. Similarly, Cafcass, the court advisory service for families and children, is critical to the process as the representative of the child's interests, but, as your editorial highlights (Time trials, 9 August), it has been criticised by the National Audit Office for \"failing to respond effectively to increased demand\" following the Baby P case. Barnardo's proposes a \"legal guillotine\" to ensure a 30-week maximum for all cases to be dealt with. Then what do you do at 30 weeks if you haven't got the information you need \u2013 make a decision anyway, as seems to be implied? Furthermore, the editorial also highlights Sir Nicholas Wall's concern \"that the new contracts for family legal aid would leave some parts of the country with almost no expert support\". The availability of family lawyers is becoming critical. Care cases are confusing to a child's (often hostile) parents and they need legal representation to assist them to understand and contribute. Finally, the editorial reminds us of a proposal to transfer family work to expert panels outside the courts. However, as long as the evidential requirements of the process remain the same, it can't matter much under whose auspices the proceedings are carried out. As the editorial remarks, \"the experience of the Child Support Agency is not a happy precedent\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
