We have not spoken about it much, but he says that he has never liked doing it, although of course he enjoys me doing it to him! It's always been a really pleasurable part of lovemaking for me and I miss it. Try to be more sexually assertive: ask for what you want! Also bear in mind that a man's excitement is often greatly increased by his partner's obvious enjoyment. And how hard is it to whisper to him: \"I'd love it if you'd go down on me\", then reward him afterwards with something that he loves? On the other hand, you could initiate the \"69\" position which will provide simultaneous gratification. Sex should never be coercive, but unless he has a serious aversion, you can help him to enjoy this activity. Some men avoid giving oral sex because they don't know exactly how to, so gently guide him to do what feels good. He may need some education about female genitalia. There are some unfortunate myths - for example that vaginas smell bad, but that would only be true if you were suffering from a particular vaginal infection. Some men have a preference for shorter (or even absent) genital hair, so ask him what he likes. While performing oral sex a partner needs to be as comfortable as possible, so try different positions until you get it right. \u00b7 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. \u00b7 Private Lives appears every Thursday.
