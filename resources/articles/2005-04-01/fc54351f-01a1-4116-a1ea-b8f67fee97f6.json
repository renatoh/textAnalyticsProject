The issue of trust (or lack of it) can hardly be avoided, given many people's opinions over the decision to take the country into the Iraq war. Days That Shook the World 8.30pm, BBC2 It's quite intriguing to examine the events leading up to the abdication crisis of 1936 so soon after the wedding of the Prince of Wales. Indeed, had King Edward VIII not felt compelled to abdicate in order to marry Wallis Simpson, the heir to the throne could have been someone different. Apart from that, however, is a sense of how much things have moved on since those tense days in December 1936 when the establishment endeavoured to prevent the marriage between a king and divorced woman. D-Day to Berlin 9pm,BBC1 Just before the Normandy landings in June 1944, Generals Eisenhower and Montgomery bet each other \u00a35 that the war would be over by that Christmas. How Eisenhower won the fiver is shown in riveting detail in this three-part drama documentary, thanks to a careful combination of reconstructions, archive footage and interviews with both British and American soldiers. Monty's intention was to capture Caen on D-Day itself, but it took another month of heavy fighting before that could be accomplished. In the meantime, thousands died horrific deaths in what became a war of attrition. Grand Designs 9pm, Channel 4 Jeremy and Louise Brown love old houses so much that they bought a 16th-century farmhouse in Gloucestershire that has been hardly touched for 400 years. No horrible 1970s \"improvements\" for them; just original Elizabethan leaded windows and ancient plaster. Now the challenge is to retain the house's history while adding modern luxuries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
