Despite the frosty conditions Nice returned to the top of La Championnat thanks to a 2-0 home win over Lille, while challengers Monaco could only manage a 0-0 draw against lowly Bastia. The league leaders rediscovered their early season form to take the lead with a Abdelmalek Cherrad goal after 57 minutes. Lille's attempts to get back into the game suffered a severe blow after Fernando D'Amico received his marching orders for a second bookable offence, before a Kaba Diawara penalty secured the points to see Nice leapfrog Marseille and Lyon at the top. On Friday night Lyon defeated Marseille 1-0 thanks to a goal from Peguy Luyindula in the first half. Bizarrely, the game was refereed by Italian Pierluigi Collina. The reason? All of the regular French officials were at a training camp for the week, obviously. It may not sound interesting but Monaco and Bastia's goalless draw was packed full of controversy. Not only did Monaco's Eric Cubilier receive a straight red card for a knee-high tackle on Greg Vanney, but Monaco coach Didier Deschamps was ordered to the stands in the dying minutes. Deschamps criticised referee Bruno Derrien near the end of the game and was promptly removed from the touchline with his tail between his legs. Rennes' recent good form continued as they beat fourth place Guingamp 2-1. The hosts looked odds on for relegation in October but the arrival of new coach Vahid Halilhodzic has sparked a turn around of fortunes with five straight wins. An own goal from Claude Michel sent Rennes on their way before Dominique Arribage doubled the lead.Stephane Carnot pulled a goal back for Guingamp late on after Olivier Echoufani and Christophe Le Roux were sent off for beating each other about the head. There were yet more red cards in the match between AC Ajaccio and Paris St-Germain. Ajaccio had Moroccan Walid Regragui sent off for violent conduct with 20 minutes remaining. Four minutes later however, PSG striker Bartholomew Ogbeche thought he'd even things up as he was also dismissed for violent conduct, taking the weekend's red card count to six in only seven games. Unfortunately the red cards were the only exciting thing about the game as it finished goalless. Bordeaux were victorious in the local derby with Montpellier. Bordeaux were given a scare in the first 10 minutes as the visitors took the lead thanks to Bertrand Robert. But goals from Bortolini Savio, David Jemmali and Pauleta - with his 11th of the season - gave Bordeaux a welcome 3-1 win. Senegalese international Amdy Faye scored the only goal of the game as Auxerre beat Troyes 1-0. The goal sent Troyes to their eleventh defeat of the season. Results: AC Ajaccio 0-0 Paris St-Germain Auxerre 1-0 Troyes Bordeaux 3-1 Montpellier Lyon 1-0 Marseille Nice 2-0 Lille Monaco 0-0 Bastia Rennes 2-1 Guingamp"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
