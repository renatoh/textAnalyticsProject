Think Frank Tyson in 1954-55 or John Snow in 1970-71. Jimmy Anderson's haul of wickets and his impact on this series do not yet equal the deeds of those giants of Ashes history but he has achieved something that neither Tyson nor Snow could possibly match: he popped back home between the second and third Tests to be present at the birth of his daughter. The old-timers may regard that 21,000-mile flit across the globe as a self-indulgence but one measure of Anderson's increasing self-discipline is that while in England during that period he kept himself on Australian time. As a consequence he hardly seemed the worse for wear when he returned to Perth. Discipline has been the hallmark of the England pace attack on this Ashes expedition, as exemplified by their efforts in Adelaide and Melbourne, and Anderson is now the undisputed leader of that attack. Sometimes it is necessary to pinch oneself before recognising his new standing. Anderson is only 28 and looks younger; he still speaks in a Burnley whisper yet it is eight years since he made his Test debut; he is the only bowler in this series, on either side, who has played Ashes cricket in Australia before; he has 205 Test wickets to his name and his coaches are queuing up to say that he is just about the best fast bowler in the world. Peter Moores, once his England coach, who now sees Anderson \u2013 very infrequently \u2013 at Lancashire, thinks he can be the best. David Saker, England's bowling coach, only just remembered the claims of South Africa's Dale Steyn in time. \"He [Anderson] has improved his game so much he's either No1 or No2,\" Saker said a couple of days ago. \"Obviously Steyn is a class bowler. It's neck and neck for those two as the best fast bowlers in the world.\" Anderson has certainly been the leading fast bowler in Australia this winter despite the late intervention of Chris Tremlett. Yet it seldom looks as if it comes naturally for him to lead \u2013 or to sledge, for that matter. He has been doing a bit of both in this series. In explaining how his career was rejuvenated a couple of years ago Anderson mentions Moores, whose name keeps cropping up in relation to the retention of the Ashes this winter. Moores, in his spell as England coach, appointed some of the key men currently behind the scenes: Andy Flower and Richard Halsall have rightly been lauded for their coaching. The England and Wales Cricket Board should be grateful for that. Meanwhile Kevin Pietersen invites our gratitude for helping to get rid of Moores back in January 2009. But Anderson takes a far more generous view of Flower's predecessor. \"A key moment for me,\" he says, \"was in 2008 in New Zealand when Moores told me that he wanted me to lead the attack. Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison were both dropped [after the first Test in Hamilton] and he put a lot of faith in me. That boosted my confidence a lot.\" Since then Anderson has kept on improving. For five years he had been a peripheral member of the Test squad after his debut season in 2003. But now he has not missed a Test match for England since the Wellington game of 2008, except when he was rested for the tour of Bangladesh last winter \u2013 a sure sign of his growing importance to the side. In that time he has taken 143 wickets in 36 matches. In the list of England wicket-takers he will be cruising past the men he replaced before too long. Hoggard took 248, Harmison 226. The sledging is a bit of a mystery. He always looks much more like Brian Statham than Freddie Trueman in his approach to batsmen and he is so soft-spoken that it seems unlikely his voice would carry far enough down the pitch to be audible. But he has obviously been indulging in this series. He was pressed on the topic last week. \"The verbals get me fired up,\" he said. \"But I pick my players.\" He did not sledge Ricky Ponting, he explained, because that might be counter-productive, serving only to get the Australia captain going (whereupon he missed the opportunity to add that Ponting has not stayed around long enough to feel the force of his tongue). \"In the past it [sledging] has been an emotional thing. The last couple of years I've been more controlled.\" Anderson's improvement has practically nothing to do with what he does with his tongue, though. It stems from what he does with the ball once he has glided effortlessly up to the crease at a canter, always with something in reserve. He has swung the Kookaburra conventionally when it is new. Sometimes he has found reverse swing when it is older. In the second innings at Melbourne the pitch was so abrasive that there was some reverse swing as early as the 11th over. Just occasionally he pops down the bouncer but by and large he has grown more conservative with experience. He has bought into Saker's \"bowl dry\" philosophy. Anderson is quick to praise Saker for developing his ability to swing the ball by either method. He says he has also learnt how to hit the seam more often from watching Mohammad Asif and he has studied how Zaheer Khan goes about his swing bowling. He is now confident in his technique but also in his general attitude to the task in hand. He no longer feels naked and despondent when the ball is not hooping around corners, which is a critical advance for a swing bowler. \"Body language is a huge thing,\" he says. \"I try to keep my shoulders back now and to be positive. In the past I've been pretty average at that.\" On occasions he has looked like a city trader who has lost his iPhone as he sulked back to his mark in the middle of a barren spell. He seems a little more cheerful now. Alongside the skills has been a new discipline, relentlessly encouraged by an England bowling coach who does not try to overcomplicate matters. In Brisbane Anderson bowled one of the best wicket-less spells imaginable on the third morning against Brad Haddin and Mike Hussey. There was only exasperation as the two Australians played and missed and survived. Perhaps the old Anderson would have been disheartened. At the time one wondered whether he could cope with the injustice of it all. \"It was pretty much one of the best spells I've ever seen,\" Saker says. \"Every ball he bowled was challenging the top of off stump. As many plans as you can have in world cricket, the best is to hit the top of off stump.\" This was not the same Anderson who had traipsed around Australia four years ago with five wickets at an average of 82 to show for his troubles. At The Gabba he was not too discouraged that such a brilliant spell would go unrewarded. \"What he's taught the rest of the fast bowling group is to be patient and to bowl in good areas because you'll get the results in the end,\" says Saker. So far this means 17 wickets for Anderson in the first four Tests at 29 apiece. More importantly his first-innings bowling in Adelaide and Melbourne gave England the impetus for their two wins. It was not necessary to be an incurable optimist to envisage success for Anderson in this series. However, the progress of the young or inexperienced pace bowlers, in the absence of Stuart Broad, has exceeded expectations. This is why it now seems conceivable that England might eventually overhaul the three sides above them in the ICC Test rankings table. They now sense that they have genuine depth and variety in their bowling attack. It is no longer straightforward to pick what might constitute their best attack. The wiseacres pontificated that it was impossible to take 20 wickets in Australia with a four-man bowling attack. Yet England have managed to do that with time to spare in three of the Tests and their bowlers' haul of 67 wickets in the series is 21 better than the efforts of their Australian counterparts. Suddenly Steve Finn is a forgotten man, even though he took 14 wickets in the first three Tests \u2013 more than any of the Australians has managed so far. \"These have been intense Test matches and this has been his first Ashes series,\" says Flower. \"And it is harder in Australia, especially for a 21-year-old. He has done very, very well.\" Flower may be delighted by Finn's development but he has been taken aback by the progress of Chris Tremlett. \"He has been outstanding on this tour. He was not even a certain pick for the squad. I was actually surprised by the skill he showed in Hobart [against Australia's A team before the first Test].\" With Tim Bresnan nervelessly displaying his ability to reverse swing the ball in Melbourne, England now have real options, especially when Broad is fit and if Graham Onions ever recovers properly from his back operation. But for the moment Anderson rightly joins the chorus from within the England camp emphasising that they should not look beyond Sydney. \"Two-two is no good to us,\" he says. \"It is important to go out on a high.\" But there is a jaunty confidence as well as he anticipates the final Test. He adds with a fresh glint in his eye, which was never in evidence on the Ashes tour of four years ago: \"David Saker thinks it will swing in Sydney. And there may be some reverse swing as well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
