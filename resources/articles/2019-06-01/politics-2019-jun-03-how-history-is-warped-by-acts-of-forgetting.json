I am reminded of this, from \u00c9douard Glissant: \u201cTo forget is to offend, and memory, when it is shared, abolishes this offence. If we want to share the beauty of the world, if we want to be in solidarity with its suffering, we need to learn how to remember together.\u201d For us all fully to share memories of mass atrocity (such as slavery, Holocaust, ethnic cleansing) and the abjection of individuals, and to share a commitment to social justice, we need both to overhaul the curricula at every level of our education system and to implement a radical redistribution of wealth and power. But as individuals we can begin to abolish the offence of forgetting by expanding our educational horizons. Dr Max Farrar Emeritus professor, Leeds Beckett University \u2022 In his otherwise excellent article on the partiality that informs our representation of the past, Gary Younge repeats the mantra that 1066 was \u201cthe last time Britain was invaded\u201d. Aside from the excusable omission of \u201csuccessfully\u201d, it is the traditional reluctance to describe the events of 1688 as an invasion of which he has fallen foul. The Whig interpretation of William of Orange\u2019s coup d\u2019etat as the Glorious Revolution, which ushered in a century and a half of anti-Catholic prejudice and discrimination, is itself a prime example of the deliberate selectivity in the construction of the historical record that impedes our knowledge of the whole truth about the past.
