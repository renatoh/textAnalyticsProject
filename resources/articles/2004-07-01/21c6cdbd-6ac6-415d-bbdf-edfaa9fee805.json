Over three years, the tasks the students were set have linked together.\" The final task was to create a website about the project, launched last week, for which students collaborated with Globe staff. \"They had sessions with our masters of voice and music, but also with our communications department and web designers,\" says Ryan. Martin Hanlon, from Archbishop Michael Ramsey technology college, one of the schools that took part, believes this breadth has been vital. \"The students have a deeper understanding of how the theatre operates in a commercial world. We did a lot of work on the plays and met with actors, but we also talked to the people who work on making sure the theatre is still viable next year.\" The unusual longevity of the project was also appealing - although it has taken some considerable time commitment to accommodate several sessions a term over a three-year period. \"If I'm honest, it was tiring at times,\" says Hanlon. \"But the class has benefited enormously from the project and genuinely enjoyed it. I think they'll miss it now it's gone.\" As part of the project, Rolake Olawole, Rabi Isa, Susannah Oso, Jennifer Jumbo, Wale Adeyemi, Michael Bhadmus and Adepeju Popoola, all pupils at the school, interviewed Mark Rylance, the Globe's artistic director. Says Hanlon: \"For them to be able to go into a building like the Globe and talk to the artistic director, to feel comfortable in that environment and to ask detailed questions and be confident about it is a great achievement.\" How has your role as artistic director affected you as an actor? Mark Rylance: To be an actor is a kind of childlike thing. You pretend you're someone you're not and you get up in front of people and say words that are not yours. It's very innocent, in a way. It's very difficult to do a play a hundred times. You do it once, but to do it a hundred times, you've got to like to do it. It's no good if you're just doing it out of duty; you only really get on if you enjoy it. But the board and trustees, they're not very childlike at all. They're very organised and adult and you've got to stay in check. Sometimes I have to make a barrier between the two things. In a way it's like being a father or an eldest child. You might think: \"Oh, I'd really like to buy myself some new trainers\", like I might, as an actor, say \"I'd really like to spend today just wandering around looking at people and trying to find someone who looks a bit like the character I'm going to play\". But I know that if I spend that money on trainers, then that younger brother or sister might not get what they need, so I will deny myself that because I'm the one responsible for the whole thing, and that's a good thing to do. I think it happens more at your age in family things, doesn't it? I mean being asked to be responsible to the family and yet you also have your own needs and your own life to lead, and so that's always a difficulty. On the other hand it's very helpful to be an actor and for the other actors to know that if I'm asking them to go and act in the pouring rain I am also out there in the pouring rain. What do you think makes the Globe a successful theatre? MR: A theatre only survives if it has a connection to the public. If they feel the life we're presenting is not the life they recognise, they may not come. That doesn't mean it has to be exactly like their life. If you go to the movies, you don't necessarily want to see your life up there. You want to see some-thing fantastic, but still you want to recognise the story. You want to think: \"Yeah, I could love that person.\" Or, if there's a hero, you don't want him to be completely fearless, you want to see him cry and then get over it - you want to see a connection. What has been the most enjoyable production you have been in? MR: It's a good question but I'm not very good at answering it. I can never quite remember. Playing a play is like playing a sport; you don't always have a great game, but then sometimes everything gels together and all the passes are beautiful. You feel part of something bigger than yourself and I enjoy that. I think the longest I've ever been part of a company was two years at the RSC, before I came here. And now, here, I've been part of this for coming on nine years - that's as long as I've lived in one house. You get to know the people you work with; you see their ups and downs and they see your ups and downs, so if things go wrong, we know each other and can rely on each other. Do you have any plans to establish links with other countries, for example, Africa? MR: We had a company come from South Africa, a company of Zulu actors. They came twice and did Macbeth, and they were probably the best actors we've had on that stage. All the skills they had naturally were skills that were useful to us. We don't want to go to countries and say: \"This Shakespeare's better than what you've got,\" or \"You need us.\" Shakespeare is meant as a friend not as a controller, and what was nice was when the Zulu company came they said: \"Shakespeare was a Zulu. He understood a part of our history.\" What influence does the audience have on the performance? MR: Oh, a lot. I learn a lot from the audience - where they laugh, where they're quiet, where they shift around. Often they will laugh at things and I don't know what they're laughing at and I think: \"Has my hair fallen out?\" Then I'll realise, \"Oh, that's what they're laughing at, I never thought of that - that the character said and did that\" and then perhaps try to play that laugh. I'm always trying things with an audience and they either accept or reject them, and then I try something else. It's a bit like planting a garden. You plant different moments in characters and some of the plants die and some of them live; some of them get too big and you have to cut them down. I'm doing it for the audience, that's my living. If I didn't connect with the audience, I'd have to do something a bit more honourable, like be a teacher. No, really, teachers should get more respect than actors. My parents are both teachers. What are your thoughts on the Right to Reply project and the education work at the Globe? MR: First of all, you've really made me think today, since I've been trying to choose my words in ways that would mean something to you. That makes me think about things differently, which is great. I learned some things about myself and maybe a little bit about you, from the way you've listened. And I'm glad you're interested in the Globe and in Shakespeare. You maybe don't realise that you've got a unique perspective on the future. You may not feel very powerful, you may feel the future is very unknown to you, but you've got a perspective that a lot of people are interested in. When you ask me a question you share that perspective and so you've given me a lot today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
