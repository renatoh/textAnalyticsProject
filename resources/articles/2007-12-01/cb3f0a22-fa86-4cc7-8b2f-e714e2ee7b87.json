Unlike his immediate predecessor and successors, he trained as an artist and, apart from wartime service, devoted his entire career to the Tate and the museum world. Despite his reticent personality, his achievement was remarkable and radical. Born in Dulwich, south London, Norman studied at Wilson's grammar school, Camberwell, Edinburgh College of Art and Edinburgh University, but his career as an artist was interrupted by the second world war, during which he served in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, reaching the rank of major. On being demobbed in 1946, he joined the Tate staff, becoming deputy director in 1954 and keeper in 1959. During these years, under the directorship of Sir John Rothenstein, Norman became largely responsible for the administration, and particularly for the setting up of the conservation department. From 1961 he was active in talks on the new building to fill the last, northern, quarter of the existing site. When Rothenstein retired in 1964, the favourites to succeed him were Bryan Robertson, then director of the Whitechapel Gallery, east London, and Lawrence (later Sir Lawrence) Gowing, at the time principal of Chelsea School of Art. The appointment of Norman Reid was somewhat of a surprise, though no one knew the workings of the Tate better. He immediately set about reforming the structure of the collections, and following this of the curatorial staff, which almost doubled. Hitherto the collection of British paintings of all periods, together with a few sculptures and drawings, had been regarded as one unit distinct from the collection of modern foreign art. Believing that the 20th-century holdings of the Tate could be much more fully integrated, Norman united them in the modern collection, bringing up the foreign paintings from the lower galleries, where they had been isolated, and showing them together with contemporary movements in British art. In his new appointments, Norman displayed exceptional wisdom and tolerance. While Ronald Alley, who was already on the staff, became keeper of the modern collection in 1965, Norman was happy to accept the appointment of his former rival Gowing as keeper of the historic British collection. The work achieved together by Norman and Lawrence in the two years and four months that Lawrence stayed at the Tate was extraordinary. The collections were completely rehung - the high point of the British display being a radically new decor for the Turners - and a more logical, historic sequence was achieved for the whole collection. And under Norman's tactful supervision, Lawrence's enthusiastic activities extended to the modern collection as well. Norman was perhaps lucky in that his appointment coincided with a great improvement in the government's attitude towards the arts, and he certainly knew how to take advantage of these new circumstances. The basic grant for acquisitions was increased from \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000, with an additional \u00a350,000 to buy 20th-century classics. The grant continued to rise step by step to \u00a31,570,000 in 1979-80. The first use of the special grant for 20th-century masterpieces was on Picasso's Three Dancers and works by Mondrian and Soutine. The grant was further used to acquire important works, often the first by their artist to enter the collection, by Salvador Dal\u00ed, Julio Gonz\u00e1lez and Henri Laurens. Particularly important for acquisitions in the field of the modern collection were Norman's personal friendships with a number of leading artists, which led to either gifts or purchases at very favourable terms. The special collections which, far from over-balancing the collection give it its special character, were largely the result of such relationships, the artists involved being Alberto Giacometti, Mark Rothko, Naum Gabo, Ben Nicholson, Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. The case of Rothko is typical. It took four years of negotiations before the artist offered the Tate the gift of nine of the paintings originally done for the Four Seasons restaurant in the Seagram Building, New York, and the pictures arrived in London only on the day of Rothko's death, February 25 1970. Paradoxically, the clinching point for Rothko was that his pictures would be shown in the same building as those from the Turner bequest, though this has no longer been the case since they were moved to the new Tate Modern in 2000. Naturally, not all of Norman's endeavours bore fruit. The most notable one that got away, but, as Norman said, \"was well worth the pursuing\", was the private collection of Peggy Guggenheim. At the same time the historic British collection was also transformed. Hitherto it had been left largely to rely on the rich collection of paintings by the leading artists of the 18th and 19th centuries, including the Pre-Raphaelites, inherited as 19th-century acquisitions by the National Gallery, from which the Tate had been finally separated only in 1954. Under Norman a more systematic attempt was made to fill gaps and round out the collection in both width and depth. The frontiers were pushed back from the age of Hogarth to the followers of Holbein and, in part through the example of Paul Mellon in America, it was realised that there was much more to British 18th-century art than the swagger portrait and the grand landscape. In particular, sporting paintings - and not just the masterpieces of George Stubbs - were positively sought after despite their relatively high price. Other neglected fields were also pursued, such as subject painting in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and plein-air sketches. Reid's years also saw a great expansion in other fields. With the creation of the Hayward Gallery on London's South Bank in 1968, the Tate became fully responsible for its own exhibitions, hitherto largely organised by the Arts Council. A separate education department was established. An archive largely devoted to 20th-century British art was established in 1971 and a collection of contemporary prints in 1974. Throughout his period of directorship, Norman was also involved in building schemes. Indeed, it took that time for the plans to fill the final quarter of the gallery to reach completion. The early stages of this scheme were marked by one of the most extraordinary suggestions in the history of the gallery, that lacking further room for expansion an extension should be constructed right across the front of the building. Norman was probably as relieved as everybody else when, partly spurred on by the promise of the Henry Moore gift, the government agreed in 1979 to relinquish the site of the RAMC hospital immediately downstream from the gallery and the scheme was dropped. While the building of the final quarter continued, the rest of Norman's directorship was taken up with the problem of acquiring funds for work on the new site. All along it was seen as a chance to reunite the great collection of Turners, which, after the Thames flood of 1928, had been divided between the National Gallery, the Tate and the British Museum. Chance and personal charm, led, within months of Norman's retirement, to success in acquiring the promise of adequate funds from the Clore Foundation. It would be idle to pretend that there was no dissension during Norman's years. The changing enthusiasms of a younger generation led in the later 1970s to public attacks on the gallery, particularly by David Hockney. Norman's pursuit of the modern had neglected the renewed interest in representational art. Also, despite the relatively adequate funding, he still believed in a selective, rather than all-embracing, acquisitions policy. Perhaps the inflated fuss over the so-called Tate \"Bricks\" (Carl Andr\u00e9's Equivalent VIII) in 1976 led to a certain loss of nerve. Nevertheless, Norman's achievements remain outstanding and were unsurpassed until the revolutionary achievements of the present director, Sir Nichoas Serota. As Lawrence Gowing wrote in Encounter in August 1979: \"It will be quite impossible to condescend to the Tate in future ... The unity and consistency of the view will, incidentally, make it plain that this is the view and the thought of one person, Norman Reid. We do not think of him as at all assuming or obtrusive, but he is certainly uncommonly persistent and perceptive\". Norman served on a number of committees concerned with contemporary art and with conservation, and after his retirement was a trustee of the Graham and Kathleen Sutherland Foundation from 1980 until 1985. He was knighted in 1970, given an honorary LittD at the University of East Anglia in 1971, and made an officer of the Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle in 1953. Norman marked his retirement by a return to his original love, painting, and is represented in the collections of the Tate and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. A one-man show in 1990 revealed a typical reticence, in part derived from the work of his master, William Gillies, but also influenced - though not overwhelmed - by the works of many of the artists he most admired. The wider side of this artistic sensibility is, however, to be seen in the richness and depth of the acquisitions he secured for the Tate. Among his last public appearances was his attendance last April at the memorial service for Denis Farr, who had begun his career at the Tate in the early 1950s. Although confined to a wheelchair, Norman maintained his loyalty to and affection for his colleagues to the end. His wife, Jean Bertram, whom he married in 1941, died earlier this year; he is survived by a son and a daughter. \u00b7 Norman Robert Reid, gallery curator, born December 27 1915; died December 17 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
