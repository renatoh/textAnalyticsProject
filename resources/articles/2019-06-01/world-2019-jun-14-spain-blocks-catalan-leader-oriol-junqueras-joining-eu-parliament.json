On Friday, the court temporarily rejected a petition for Junqueras to leave jail on Monday to begin the process of becoming an MEP. It said that allowing him to take the preliminary steps at the central electoral committee in Madrid would oblige him to travel to Brussels in July to take up the seat he won in last month\u2019s European elections. That trip to Brussels, it ruled, would present \u201can irreversible danger to the outcome of the trial\u201d and would involve \u201cthe loss of jurisdictional control over the preventative measures to which he is subject the moment he leaves Spanish territory\u201d. The court also pointed out that Brussels had become the base of the so-called \u201cgovernment of the Catalan republic in exile\u201d since Junqueras\u2019s former boss, the deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, fled to Belgium to avoid arrest in October 2017. Junqueras, who faces a 25-year sentence if convicted of rebellion over his alleged part in Catalonia\u2019s attempt to secede from Spain, was allowed out of prison on 21 May to take up the seat he won in April\u2019s general election. The court said the two situations were different. It also said the rejection of the petition did not mean that Junqueras had lost his right to participate in the European parliament, adding it had merely been \u201ctemporarily postponed until such time as the trial has concluded and the obstacles standing in the way of his taking up his seat have disappeared\u201d. Junqueras\u2019s party, the Catalan Republican Left, described the ruling as \u201canother attack on democracy\u201d and said it would appeal the court\u2019s decision. The trial phase of the landmark proceedings against Junqueras and 11 other Catalan separatist leaders ended on Wednesday after four months and hearing from more than 400 witnesses. The former regional vice-president told the supreme court that voting for a Catalan republic could never been considered a crime, and said he hoped a political solution to the crisis would be found. \u201cI genuinely believe that the best thing for all of us \u2013 for Catalonia, for Spain, for everyone \u2013 would be to see this issue returned to the sphere of politics \u2013 good politics \u2013 an area it should never have left,\u201d he said. A verdict and sentences are not expected until the autumn. Negotiations are still under way to form national, local and regional governments after the general election and the electoral \u201csuper-Sunday\u201d at the end of May. Spanish politics have become increasingly divided in recent years with the arrival of new parties that have challenged the traditional dominance of the socialists and the conservative People\u2019s party (PP). The ruling socialists won the most votes in the general election but fell well short of a majority in the congress of deputies \u2013 a fragmentation that was repeated in the local and regional elections. On Saturday, freshly elected council across Spain will hold sessions to elect mayors. In Barcelona \u2013 where a Catalan pro-independence party won the most votes \u2013 Ada Colau may try to hold on to office by entering a coalition with the Catalan socialist party and others. Elsewhere, especially in Madrid, the focus will be on whether the PP and the centre-right Citizens party are willing to make deals with the far-right Vox to win power."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
