The republican dissident group said in a statement on Thursday night that it planted the device that was discovered under the officer\u2019s car at Shandon Park golf club in Belfast on Saturday. It was defused without causing casualties. \u201cWe were unlucky this time but we only have to be lucky once,\u201d said the statement, which was passed to the Irish News using a codeword. The statement underlined the New IRA\u2019s determination to continue its terror campaign despite a backlash over the killing of the journalist Lyra McKee in Derry in April. The device, which police have called sophisticated, was planted under the 55-year-old officer\u2019s car outside his home on Friday night. It was spotted the next day at the golf club. \u201cWe are confident the device would have exploded if it was not for the level terrain it had travelled on,\u201d said the statement, which referred to the group as the \u201cIRA\u201d. Security forces call it the New IRA to distinguish it from the Sinn-F\u00e9in-aligned Provisional IRA, which waged a three-decade campaign during the Troubles before calling a ceasefire in 1994 and backing the 1998 Good Friday agreement. Two cars linked to the attempted bomb attack were found on fire in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast early on Saturday. One of the cars had Dublin licence plates, prompting a cross-border investigation. DCI Stuart Griffin, of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, said detectives were aware of the claim of responsibility and that it would form part of the investigation. The New IRA emerged in 2012 via a merger of several groups opposed to the peace process, including the Real IRA. Police believe it has several hundred active supporters, a mix of former Provisional IRA members and new, young recruits. One of its members shot McKee, 29, during riots in Derry in April. The group apologised and said he was aiming at police. The murder galvanised a renewed attempt by political parties to restore Northern Ireland\u2019s collapsed power-sharing government. Talks at Stormont continue. The New IRA also claimed responsibility for a car bomb outside Derry\u2019s courthouse in January and letter bombs sent to Britain in March. Its members murdered two prison guards, David Black in 2012 and Adrian Ismay in 2016."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
