Arteta was discussing personal terms last night over a \u00a32.8m move after playing 13 times for the Merseyside club, scoring one goal. A proportion of the fee has already been paid as part of the loan agreement. \"I'd like to stay, definitely,\" said the Spaniard, who has also had spells at Barcelona, Paris St-Germain and Rangers. \"I have been happy here and I feel very comfortable with the club and my team-mates.\" The midfielder was contracted until 2008, with an option for a further two years, by Sociedad. Everton are likely to offer him a four-year deal. David Weir, Leon Osman and Duncan Ferguson are expected to agree new contracts, leaving Alan Stubbs (likely to sign for Wigan or Bolton), Steve Watson, Alessandro Pistone and Gary Naysmith yet to pledge their future to the club. Southampton expect to confirm today that Harry Redknapp will continue as manager. Further talks took place yesterday which dealt with Redknapp's imminent pay cut and bonuses on offer for winning promotion. Tottenham have a chance to appear in next season's Uefa Cup after finishing second to Arsenal in the Fair Play rankings and now go into the June 5 draw for a place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
