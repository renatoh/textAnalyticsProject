Return it to the company \u2013 and last year seven out of 10 glass bottles came back for refilling \u2013 and you get 30p. It's a simple scheme and an old one, sadly defunct in the rest of the country, where disposable plastic replaced glass years ago, with bad consequences for the environment. Energy is wasted making the plastic and the remains litter roadside verges for ever, or at least until councils gather them up at great expense. That's why the Campaign to Protect Rural England is right to call for the deposit refund scheme to be revived, charging 15p for small bottles and cans, and 30p for larger ones. A report commissioned by the CPRE claims the cost of running the scheme could be funded by unclaimed deposits, and that the public sector would save \u00a3160m a year in cleaning costs. Some will dispute those figures, but deposit schemes work in other countries. When deposits were brought back in New York state and Germany, litter rates fell. Retailers won't like it: they think customers should recycle glass bottles. But melting glass down uses energy, and anyway the bigger problem is plastic, most of which is now thrown away. The CPRE's report estimates that 24bn drink containers \u2013 cans and bottles \u2013 would be recovered each year. The government says it is interested. An old idea may be about to be reused \u2013 just like the bottles themselves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
