The 34-year-old former England captain has amassed a fortune estimated at \u00a3125m ($184m), almost 40% greater than retired heavyweight boxer Lennox Lewis, who is in second place. Beckham's fortune, buoyed by his spells with Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy and Italy's AC Milan, put him tied for 426th overall in Britain, on a list which was headed last year by steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, who is a shareholder of Queen's Park Rangers. In the list of athletes, the next seven places are occupied by current or former formula one figures, with Jenson Button tied for ninth place with England striker Michael Owen on \u00a340m ($59m). Fabio Capello, is tied for 15th place with golfer Nick Faldo. Capello's \u00a330m ($44m) fortune includes an art collection worth \u00a310m ($15m)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
