Tron is still celebrated for its pioneering computer graphics and retro 80s styling, but its plot was fatally impenetrable and forgettable. That formula seems to have been honoured here: visually, Tron Legacy is sleek, polished and thrillingly state of the art; storywise, it's bonkers. Even for viewers familiar with the first Tron, there's a great deal to take on board here. The opening flashback in Tron Legacy even resorts to Jeff Bridges using action figures to explain the history to his son. This is as well as a voiceover explanation of \"the grid\", the virtual realm into which Kevin Flynn, Bridges' character, mysteriously disappeared 20 years ago. When Flynn's grown-up son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) is now also zapped into the grid, he finds not one dad but two. There's Clu, the bad guy, whose face is an almost-convincing computerised 1980s-era Jeff Bridges. He \"doesn't dig imperfection\" and runs Tron-world as a sort of Nazi regime. Then there's the real Flynn, played by present-day Bridges, who rhapsodises over free information and \"biodigital jazz\" like a cross between Obi-Wan Kenobi and The Dude from the Big Lebowski. Things have moved on in this virtual world, but they've not strayed too far from the preoccupations of the average teenage boy. The gladiatorial action, involving \"light cycles\", or deadly frisbees, delivers videogame dynamics, while the styling is all shiny black surfaces, neon highlights and skin-tight bodysuits. Combined with the pounding Daft Punk score, it often feels like being trapped in a 90s fetish club. It all tips into parody when Michael Sheen turns in an abysmal cameo as an androgynous nightclub owner. He's supposed to be a cyber-Aladdin Sane (the David Bowie character), but he comes on like Tony Blair doing Rocky Horror. As things speed towards the climax, the questions start to pile up. If this is a computer world, everything is presumably an analogy for something else, but what? What does that drunk guy sitting on a street corner represent? A virus? A deleted desktop folder? How come some parts of this world are plastic and malleable, but in others there are antique books and roast suckling pigs? If old Jeff is the champion of \"imperfection\", how come his hideout looks so minimalist and anal? What are the rules here? Perhaps information shouldn't be this free. But the need to think about this stuff is optional. Tron Legacy is best enjoyed as a showreel of cutting-edge visuals \u2013 an extended Daft Punk video, perhaps, or a computer simulation of Bridges' inner turmoil since he won his Oscar last year. He won't win any for this but the visual effects departments might. It is often beautiful to look at, and could come to represent the fashion tropes of its era as faithfully as its predecessor did. And the silliness somehow adds to the enjoyment rather than detracting from it. It's the best kind of bonkers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
