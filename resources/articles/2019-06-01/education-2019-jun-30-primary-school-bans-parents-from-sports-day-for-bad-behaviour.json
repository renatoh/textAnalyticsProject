Sheena Duggan, the headteacher at Pentrebane school in Cardiff, said staff had been sworn at in front of children. In a letter to parents seen by the BBC, Duggan said the behaviour had \u201cworsened\u201d over the past few years. She wrote: \u201cAs you know the safety, happiness and wellbeing of our pupils, your children, is paramount and so with that in mind I have made the difficult decision that future sports days will not be open to parents. \u201cIt is very sad but I feel strongly that my staff and pupils do not come to school to be exposed to the bad behaviour of a small minority of adults.\u201d The letter was sent last week, the day after the school\u2019s annual sports day. A father who attended the sports day and wished to remain anonymous told the BBC he was unaware of any overzealous or aggressive conduct. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve honestly no idea what happened to spark this off. It was a really nice day. All the children were involved. Everyone was cheered on and got a round of applause. \u201cSome parents were competitive, as you might expect, but none were aggressive or threatening towards staff that I could see.\u201d He said Duggan was well respected and \u201ctakes no nonsense\u201d, and \u201csomething particularly bad must have happened\u201d for the decision to be made. \u201cBut no one I know has any idea what it is. There\u2019s lots of unhappiness from parents who don\u2019t think they should be punished for the bad behaviour of others.\u201d Parents were banned from attending a school sports day in 2003 for fear of \u201cembarrassing\u201d their children. A less competitive format for the event was introduced at Maney Hill primary school in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
