But I don't think I've ever had the recognition that I would have received if I'd played for Wales at a World Cup finals. \"I have had stick from David Beckham and Paul Scholes in the past. At least I can go back and have a little peace.\" Goals either side of half-time from John Hartson and Simon Davies gave the Welsh a 2-0 victory in their first group match and have heightened expectations that they might qualify for an international finals for the first time since 1958. Giggs still rues the night Paul Boden missed a penalty against Romania in 1993, tossing away a ticket for USA 94 in the process. \"Until now I thought that was going to be my best chance of playing in a major international tournament,\" he added. \"I remember it was a depressing evening.\" But like the rest of Mark Hughes's players and the thousands of supporters present, he now sees a chance to make up for that disappointment and qualify for Portugal 2004. \"I'm really encouraged when I look at our squad,\" he said. \"I genuinely feel we have a great opportunity to make it.\" Next up, however, is a visit from the group favourites Italy on October 16 and Giggs is honest enough to acknowledge that he will feel the full weight of a nation's expectation on his shoulders. \"It's something I've lived with for years with Wales,\" he said. \"I'm used to it now, though, and will carry on regardless. But I'm so keen to do well for my country and determined to do all I can.\" Giggs did his bit against Finland on Saturday, getting a touch on Gary Speed's header after 31 minutes that the opportunist Hartson steered past Southampton's goalkeeper Antti Niemi and low into a corner from 12 yards. Then, 18 minutes from the final whistle and moments after the other Southampton goalkeeper, Paul Jones, had tipped Jari Litmanen's effort on to and over the bar, a pass from Giggs split Sami Hyypia and Hannu Tihinen and released Davies, who beat Niemi all ends up. It finally brought a smile to the face of Hughes, who had been scowling at the interval even though his side were leading. \"I was none too pleased at half-time because there wasn't enough quality in our passing and general play,\" the manager said. \"But we picked things up in the second half - there was a bit more shape to us and I'm delighted. We're going forward on the front foot, which wasn't the case throughout the World Cup qualifying campaign.\" Hartson was refreshingly honest, too. \"We didn't play well before the interval and Mark Hughes told us so in no uncertain terms. I was delighted to score, though. I think I owed Wales a goal.\" Finland (4-4-1-1): Niemi (Southampton); Nylund (HJK Helsinki; Johansson , Charlton, 69), Hyypia (Liverpool), Tihinen (Anderlecht), Saarinen (Rosenborg; Kopteff , Viking, 78); Nurmela (Heerenveen; Kottia , HJK Helsinki, 85), Riihilahti (Crystal Palace), Tainio (Auxerre), Kolkka (Panathinaikos); Litmanen (Ajax), Kuqi (Sheffield Wednesday).
