Surprisingly, most of them don't. Clean lines, floor-to-ceiling windows and minimalist interiors make the most of the spectacular mountain scenery. And some of the most modern hotels have kept their traditional exterior; only when you step into the lobby do you find yourself in a light and airy space.

Hotel Madlein Ischgl, Austria From the outside the Hotel Madlein looks like a traditional Austrian hotel. Step inside this Zen-inspired interior and it couldn't be more different: a light and airy space with clean lines, modern furnishings and loft-style bedrooms equipped with glass-enclosed bathrooms.

Amangani Jackson Hole, USA This hotel caused great controversy when it opened five years ago because it was such a departure from the resort's traditional cowboy-style, rustic accommodation. Built on a ridge overlooking the spectacular Teton Nat ional Park, Amangani has used towering panes of glass, wood and sandstone to their best effect.

Entire walls of glass bring the mountains into your sand-coloured and white rooms, which are more like apartments with a kitchen, living room and balcony overlooking a 40-acre park. The dining room is like a big, bright, glass box. Contemporary art is displayed throughout the hotel, which also has splashes of red and yellow on the mainly white exterior.

Les Dromonts Avoriaz, France This funky 1960s hotel was once the architectural prototype for an entire ski resort: the multi-storey, terrace construction, timber cladding, porthole windows and granite-peak shape became the template for the whole of Avoriaz.
