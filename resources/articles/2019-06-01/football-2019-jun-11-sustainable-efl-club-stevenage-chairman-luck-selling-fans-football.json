Luck, says Stevenage owner", "bodyText": "Running a sustainable Football League club is possible only if you are lucky, according to the Stevenage chairman, who is about to offer shares in his club to supporters. Phil Wallace has presided over the most successful period in Stevenage FC\u2019s history since he bought the team in 1999. But with clubs in the Football League experiencing growing financial uncertainty \u2013 52 of the 72 clubs reported losses in 2017-18 \u2013 Wallace says it is no longer enough simply to run your club well if you want to keep your head above water in the lower leagues. \u201cIn my opinion you can\u2019t run a football league club sustainably without luck,\u201d says Wallace, whose primary commercial interest is the \u00a31.7bn valued Lamex Food Group. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have good housekeeping, good governance. You need to be smart with your recruitment. You need to be clever and talented with your coaching. But then you also need luck. It\u2019s not a business in the way that my company is.\u201d Stevenage finished just a point outside the League Two play-offs last season and posted a small profit in 2017-18. But the results were in large part due to the sale of the young defender Ben Wilmot to Premier League Watford and Wallace believes unexpected windfalls are increasingly important in keeping smaller clubs afloat. \u201cJust look at the last couple of seasons,\u201d he says. \u201cNewport have had some fantastic cup wins but some fantastic cup draws. That\u2019s put seven figures into their bank account [when] four years ago they were just about to go out of business. Exeter are another that were close, then they drew Manchester United in the FA Cup, with a replay. So luck\u2019s a major part.\u201d The health of Football League clubs was more parlous than ever in 2017-18, according to the Deloitte review of football finances. Championship clubs posted record losses, while across the 72 Football League clubs wages exceeded \u00a31bn for the first time. In Leagues One and Two, while revenues generally remained static, wages increased by 11% and 8% respectively. Wallace acknowledges that some clubs are less dependent on good fortune \u2013 those with rich owners. Indeed among the clubs posting the biggest losses were Wolves and Fulham, who both invested heavily, but successfully, in their attempts to reach the Premier League. That option is not available to Stevenage, according to Wallace, but he hopes to raise \u00a31.2m through selling 12% equity in the club to supporters. The offer has been arranged with the sports crowdfunding platform Tifosy, which recently helped Norwich City raise \u00a35m to renovate its academy. Such a share scheme has \u201cnever been done before\u201d, according to Wallace, who says funds will \u201cprincipally\u201d be used to fund transfers and wages. He also plans to offer shareholders voting rights on certain issues, like kit design, though his shareholding will ensure he retains a controlling interest. The scheme is currently available for \u201cpre-registration\u201d via the club. \u201cWe would take that money and principally invest in the recruitment of young players and wages, so that we can attract better players,\u201d Wallace says. \u201cThe idea would be that, if you are going to attract better players, we are improving our chances of getting promoted from League Two to League One. \u201cWe missed the play-offs by one point and we\u2019ve been in League One before for three seasons too, so that\u2019s not new to us. But if we get into League One, or when we do, we pay a 25% one-time dividend. If we get into the Championship we return 75% of the investment and [investors] still hold the shares. \u201cIt\u2019s high risk, in terms of [promotion] might not happen. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s high risk in terms of the club going bankrupt since I\u2019ve been here for 20 years, so there\u2019s a degree of solidarity behind that. It\u2019s all part of the momentum of the club going forward. We\u2019re building a new stand, just about to finish that, finish off the ground development, we\u2019ve got a great training ground, so it\u2019s all about momentum and creating some excitement.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
