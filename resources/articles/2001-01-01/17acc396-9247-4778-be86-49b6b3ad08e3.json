The 19-year-old, on loan from West Ham, scored his 10th goal in 10 games last night, scoring the first in a 2-0 win for the Cherries over Cambridge. But according to the curator of the Manchester City museum, Phil Noble, Defoe now shares the post war record with former City striker Billy McAdams who scored 10 in 10 during the 1957-58 season. A statement on the Manchester City website claims that this will \"throw a spanner in the works\" of many journalists who have rushed to praise Defoe this week, and the website also notes: \"Billy McAdams was of course knocking them in for the Blues in Division 1. Young Jermaine Defoe has achieved his run in Division 2 ( the old Division 3)!\" Noble was tipped off about the anomaly by his dad Peter. Peter, another die-hard Blue, told Football Unlimited today: \"I was there when Billy Mac scored his tenth goal. We beat Everton 6-2 and it was absolutely chucking it down. Kevin Harper also scored a hat-trick of penalties, which I think is some kind of record.\" After the tip from his dad, Phil went on to check the City record books and confirm that McAdams netted 10 in a row. Asked whether he felt sorry about depriving Defoe of his moment of glory, Noble senior said: \"Not at all.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
