The 94-cap Charvis, who at the age of 35 has yet to decide whether he will play on next season, declined to go to Wexford because his region, Newport-Gwent Dragons, had two matches in four days with a place in the Heineken Cup hinging on the outcomes. Warren Gatland said that Charvis, who last appeared for Wales against South Africa in Cardiff in November, would still be considered for the two-Test trip after three open-side flankers - Martyn Williams, Robin Sowden-Taylor and Ben Lewis - were ruled out by injury. \"Colin provides us with an option but training with us for the week in Wexford would have helped us assess him,\" said Wales's head coach. Gatland will be without a number of the players who contributed to this season's grand slam when they face the World Cup holders, including Williams, Mark Jones, Lee Byrne, Gavin Henson, Mike Phillips and Dwayne Peel, who are all injured. Moray Low, the Glasgow prop, has been forced out of Scotland's squad for the two-Test trip to Argentina next month with an ankle injury sustained in the Warriors' win against Munster on Saturday. Edinburgh's Craig Smith has been promoted from the Scotland A squad to replace Low, and Glasgow's Max Evans has been called up to join his brother Thom in the squad. The former Leinster backs coach David Knox says Ireland have made an error in appointing Declan Kidney to succeed Eddie O'Sullivan as the national coach. Knox believes the Ireland team should have been taken in a fresh direction. \"It's a big mistake to choose Declan Kidney as the new coach,\" he said. \"The Ireland team badly needed a foreign coach. After the Eddie O'Sullivan era they wanted someone to test these guys, show them a new way to play. The Munster people think Kidney is a messiah but I just don't understand that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
