In excerpts from the book entitled Unhinged, which were first reported by the Guardian, Manigault Newman claimed the president had used the \u201cN-word\u201d repeatedly, and also used racial slurs to refer to George Conway, the half-Filipino husband of the top White House aide Kellyanne Conway. Manigault Newman, who had previously appeared with Trump on his reality television show The Apprentice, also said in the book that she believed he was \u201ca racist, a bigot and a misogynist\u201d. The remarks were a break with comments made during the campaign when the former reality television celebrity vowed that those who had criticized Trump would bend the knee to him. \u201cEvery critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump,\u201d Manigault Newman said in an interview with PBS in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s everyone who\u2019s ever doubted Donald, who ever disagreed, who ever challenged him. It is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe.\u201d Asked about the allegations at a photo-op with the group Bikers for Trump on Saturday in Bedminster, New Jersey, the president said: \u201cLowlife \u2026 She\u2019s a lowlife.\u201d Manigault Newman was dismissed from the White House in December 2017. At the time, a source familiar with her departure told the Guardian that she had long been uncomfortable defending the Trump administration as the most prominent African American woman in the White House. Her tenure culminated when the chief of staff, John Kelly, summoned her to the White House situation room to fire her. Afterwards, Trump praised Manigault Newman on Twitter, saying: \u201cThank you Omarosa for your service! I wish you continued success.\u201d On Friday, the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, issued a statement on the book, saying it was \u201criddled with lies\u201d and condemning Manigault Newman for not praising Trump. \u201cInstead of telling the truth about all the good President Trump and his administration are doing to make America safe and prosperous, this book is riddled with lies and false accusations,\u201d said Sanders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
