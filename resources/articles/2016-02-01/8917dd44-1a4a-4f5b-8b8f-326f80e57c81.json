That\u2019s not really true. When Beyonc\u00e9 posted an album online unexpectedly, we all knew what it was. It was a complete set of songs (along with videos). It was an already established format on iTunes, which was, by then, an established platform. This thing that Louis CK has presented to the public is, well, I don\u2019t even know what. The 70-minute first episode certainly is not a comedy. While there are a few humorous asides in the bar room chatter, the story won\u2019t make you bust a gut \u2013 unless it\u2019s a ritual disembowelment so that you can escape the pervasive misery of the series. Even if you take it as a drama, it looks more like theatre, filmed somewhat statically on two sets. But it\u2019s not a play: it\u2019s recorded and you\u2019re watching it on your computer screen even though it feels like you\u2019re in the middle of a five-hour production of The Iceman Cometh at BAM. Just what the hell is CK trying to pull off here? Horace and Pete refers to the bar that is the setting of the action as well as the two guys who own it, Horace (CK) and his brother Pete (Steve Buscemi). They\u2019re the eighth Horace and Pete to run the establishment, which has been around for 100 years. Their Uncle Pete (Alan Alda) is the crotchety old bartender who uses the N-word repeatedly while trying to explain how he\u2019s not racist. Horace is doing a terrible job running the bar and is being sued for control of it by his sister Sylvia (Edie Falco). He\u2019s also on the outs with his two children. His daughter Alice (SNL\u2019s Aidy Bryant) tells him he \u201cknows what he did\u201d, but we\u2019re not privy to the details. It seems to have something to do with Horace\u2019s live-in girlfriend Rachel (Rebecca Hall). The mood is decidedly dour, and the crux is Sylvia\u2019s lawsuit against her brothers to try to dissolve the business. It seems as though CK is trying to explore issues around the difference between what is right and what is legal, what sort of legacy we have been left by our forefathers, and what a family looks like in the modern age. It\u2019s funny that these questions are about how we live right now when the bar, with its aged furniture and tacky decor, could have come from any time over the past 50 years. But then Horace pulls out his iPhone to make a call and you\u2019re snapped right back to the present. Not even the present: the show is set the day after it was released, which is literally yesterday. A newscaster talks about Trump stepping out of the Republican debate and the looming primary in Iowa. Bar patrons (including greats like Jessica Lange, Steven Wright and Nick DiPaolo) chatter about the upcoming Super Bowl, making specific references to the teams that will be in it, decided only a week ago. Most of the script could have been written any time, but that makes it clear those passages are fresh and it was filmed very recently. That is a refreshing urgency that we never get from television. That begs the question, yet again: what is CK up to? We know very little about this series, including how many episodes there will be, when the next one will be released \u2013 or really anything at all. The meager description offered on the site is as follows: \u201cHi there. Horace and Pete episode one is available for download. $5.\u201d CK has had great success selling his wares directly to fans on his website, and his experiment with platform as well as format is part of what makes this project so audacious. But all of that experimentation makes Horace and Pete a little hard to watch. Viewers will spend as much time figuring out just what this thing is as they will what is going on and what it all means. That is not inherently bad \u2013 in fact it\u2019s a good exercise in critical analysis \u2013 but difficult viewing turns off plenty of people. It\u2019s so much easier to plunk down $5 when you know what you\u2019re getting, like a standup comedy special, say, or a secret Beyonc\u00e9 album. Even harder to swallow will be the difficulty of the material itself. It is dark. A million miles deep in a coal mine at midnight with no moon and wearing a blindfold dark. It\u2019s sad and depressing and not very easily untangled, like the best American plays. You know the ones \u2013 those that you\u2019re forced to read in school because no one would willingly pick them up because there isn\u2019t enough Lexapro at your local CVS. That doesn\u2019t make Horace and Pete bad, it just makes it hard and Louis CK is always at his best when he\u2019s challenging expectations. This series isn\u2019t going to be for everyone, but all of the disorientation and ingenuity certainly make it one of the most thrilling things to come along in some time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
