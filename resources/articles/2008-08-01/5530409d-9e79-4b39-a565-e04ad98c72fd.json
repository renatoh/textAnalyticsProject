A double line of barges from Somerset House-stairs (where their majesties and the royal party were to embark) were safely moored last week. Regulations adopted under Sir T. Byam Martin, comptroller of the navy, were of the most satisfactory kind, although he was obliged from the great number of [individuals applying] to have stations on the line to give a vast number of refusals. At one o'clock the whole extent of the Strand was lined with multitudes of respectably dressed people, waiting the approach of their majesties: and the windows, balconies, and even tops of the houses were crowded with ladies of fashionable appearance. The whole crowd, rich and poor, were very decorous and orderly, and the latter exhibited no signs of drunkenness - an appearance too frequent on Mondays devoted to similar holiday spectacles. When the royal barges moved off from the shore, the firing of cannon, the shouts and huzzas, the waving of hats and handkerchiefs were renewed and kept up without intermission and in a manner both decorous and orderly along the whole line, on the river and the shores of both sides. The scene at this moment was inexpressibly grand. The whole space seemed studded with a moving mass of glittering splendour. The coup d'oeil from the bridge was of a novel and striking character. Between London Bridge and Southwark Bridge was formed, by the gilded and glittering barges belonging to the city companies, and by numbers of private vessels, from the lightest wherries up to the most unwieldy barges, an avenue. The regularity [of this avenue] was carefully preserved by naval officers who, rowing about in all directions, prevented the two lines from being broken. With [its exception], every part of the river's bold and extensive sweep was crowded with vessels laden as heavily as possible with spectators. So thickly covered were vessels that barely a timber was visible. Even the roofs of them, surrounded only in most cases with a narrow deal railing, were covered with people. The neighbouring churches, too, were crowded. In a word, whichever way the eye glanced, it encompassed in its view thousands of human beings. Every vessel, even to the smallest and most insignificant boat, was decorated with colours; and among all the gorgeous spectacles which old Father Thames has witnessed this, perhaps, was the most most splendid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
