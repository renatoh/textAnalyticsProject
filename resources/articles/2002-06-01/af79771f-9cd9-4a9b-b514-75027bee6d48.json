Beckenbauer was seeking to explain how Germany could go from such a result to a World Cup final in just over nine months and referring to Munich, Beckenbauer said: \"It was an accident. This is a tournament and tournaments are very different to qualifying games. This is when things like mental strength become important and Germany have shown they possess that. They have earned the right to be in the final.\" Beckenbauer's view is clearly changing. He has described the German team in the most unflattering terms before and during the World Cup yet is now at the forefront of those trying to persuade the Germany manager Rudi Voller to remain after the competition, when Voller's contract expires. \"I have to admit I am surprised by how well they have done,\" Beckenbauer said of Germany. \"They have shown they are good players and in that sense they have surprised everyone in Germany. \"Before the World Cup we were a little bit sceptical about Germany's chances but they have done well, with one exception - the game against the United States when they were very shaky. Nevertheless, they deserve to be in the final, they have won five of their games and drawn only one.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
