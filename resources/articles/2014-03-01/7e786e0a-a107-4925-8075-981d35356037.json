Exhibiting large amounts of the passion that has always enabled them to stand apart from an over-populated scene, Architects have toughened up in every department here and made a frequently brutal and complex album that belies metalcore's on-going stagnation. Songs like blistering opener Gravedigger and the joyously vicious CANCER boast plenty of the melodic hardcore sensibilities that may well be essential to their creators' upward commercial ascent, but there is no evidence of compromise within their thudding, muscular grooves and polyrhythmic punch. Architects' intelligence and knack for astute but subtle political statements is on display throughout, vocalist Sam Carter's ferocious roar adding thrilling intensity to the religion-thumping Broken Cross and the startling rage-rush of Naysayer. Above all, these are gloriously crafted anthems of defiance, imbued with dizzying emotional oomph and a near-chewable air of steely-eyed conviction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
