The Juventus sporting director, Fabio Paratici, was keen to sign Haaland from Molde in the summer of 2018 and was ready to offer \u20ac6m but the teenager was reluctant to join a side where he would sit on the bench or be loaned out. United have been aware of Haaland\u2019s ability for a long time, with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and the player working together for two seasons at Molde in 2017 and 2018. United have scouted the 19-year-old on several occasions but they and Juve will face competition from, among others, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Manchester City, Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Chelsea, all of whom have scouted him recently. In total more than 20 clubs have watched the young Norwegian. Haaland joined Salzburg from Molde in January and has scored a remarkable 23 goals in 20 appearances for the Austrian side. This season he has 22 goals in 15 games, including six in the Champions League, making him the top scorer in the competition, one ahead of Robert Lewandowski. His value has increased with each goal this season and stands at around \u20ac40m (\u00a334.5m). Salzburg bought him for around \u20ac9m in January but the club expect that they will be able to sell him for more than \u20ac60m in the summer. They are hoping that he will have a season similar to that of Luka Jovic with Eintracht Frankfurt in 2018-19, when the Serb scored 27 goals in 48 games. The Bundesliga club signed Jovic on a two-year loan from Benfica with an obligatory \u20ac5m buyout clause before selling him to Real Madrid for \u20ac60m last summer. Napoli have also made contact with Haaland\u2019s representatives, before and after his Champions League hat-trick against Genk, but were told that nothing will happen before the end of the season when Salzburg will put a value on him and see whether anyone is prepared to match it orwhether there is an auction to sign him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
