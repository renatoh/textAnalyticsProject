William Gaillard, communications director of European football governing body, said: \"The incident was the responsibility of the Spanish football authorities and Uefa views their decision as a positive outcome, in line with our own policy on such matters. \"The fine was relatively small, but we are the association of associations and we do not interfere with the internal business of any country. \"In Europe we do not tolerate this behaviour and Uefa has its own standard of fines for these incidents. But we will not be putting pressure on the Spanish authorities.\" Leon Mann, Europe and Media relations officer for Kick It Out, said: \"Work against racism in Britain has shown that fines to clubs lead to serious proactive work against racism and the Spanish football authorities need to send out a more serious message.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
