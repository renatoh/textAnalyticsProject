A dossier of evidence detailing the role of Scottish airports in so-called 'rendition' flights, compiled by human rights organisations, has been passed to the Crown Office for investigation. The report claims that British airports have been secretly used by the CIA to 'render' Islamist terror suspects to secret prisons in states where they could be tortured. In June, Scotland's new Justice Minister, Kenny MacAskill, invited civil liberties organisations to bring him any evidence Scottish airports were being used for such flights. 'The Scottish government opposes illegal rendition flights, but of course the appropriate authorities can only act on the basis of evidence,' he said. 'I invite organisations such as Amnesty International, Liberty and others to bring forward their concerns to us and we shall proceed from there.' Four months later, details of more than 100 incidents involving Scottish airports being used to refuel secret CIA flights have been passed to the Lord Advocate, Elish Angiolini. She has said that any allegations of attempts or conspiracy to torture being committed in Scotland or Scottish airspace would be taken seriously. 'Civil aviation is a reserved matter and so is the responsibility of the United Kingdom government, but attempts to commit or to conspire to commit torture are crimes under Scots law, and it is for the police to investigate allegations of such offences and for the procurator fiscal to decide whether to bring proceedings,' she said. Yesterday a spokesman for the Crown Office confirmed that a file had been passed to it and Strathclyde police will be asked to investigate. It is believed that the CIA regularly used Scottish airports to refuel aircraft carrying a number of suspected terrorists, including a senior al-Qaeda leader, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was seized by the US authorities in Pakistan in 2003. It is alleged that Glasgow, Edinburgh, Wick, Caithness, Aberdeen and Prestwick in Ayrshire were used as key staging points in the renditions circuit. Now, regardless of the result of the police inquiry, Amnesty International has said it will press the government to introduce an anti-rendition policy to ensure such flights are banned at Scottish airports. 'We want the Scottish government to sign up to an anti-rendition policy involving practical action to make sure this sort of thing can't happen again,' said John Watson, of Amnesty. 'Our colleagues in Northern Ireland recently reached agreement with Derry airport to stop rendition flights from refuelling there, and we would like the same in Scotland.' The anti-rendition policy would be the first of its kind in Europe and would allow flight controllers to check private hire flights against CIA aircraft registrations and ask the flight operator to confirm who and what is on the flight. 'If they are not satisfied with the information received, or they suspect there could be foul play such as rendition activity, the police can board the aircraft to investigate possible illegal activities,' said Watson. He admitted reports of possible rendition flights had fallen but said that did not mean they had stopped. 'It could be because of the attention that they are either not transporting people around in the same numbers or the CIA are just using different aircraft we are not aware of yet,' he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
