Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, underlined her organisation\u2019s growing concern at the most serious outbreak of trade tension since the 1930s and said \u201cself-inflicted wounds\u201d had to be avoided. In a paper prepared for the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Japan this weekend, the IMF calculated that the recently announced intensification of protectionism would cut global gross domestic product by 0.3% in 2020. The Washington-based IMF said that taken together with the tariffs announced last year the total impact would be a 0.5% hit to activity next year. \u201cThis amounts to a loss of about $455bn, larger than the size of South Africa\u2019s economy,\u201d Lagarde said, noting that there was strong evidence that the US, China and the global economy were the losers from the conflict. Donald Trump has so far ignored warnings from the IMF and other international organisations about the impact of his trade measures and in the past week has threatened action against Mexico unless its government halts the flow of people into the US. Washington said a 5% tariff on all Mexican goods would be imposed as early as next week and rise to 25% by October. The Federal Reserve \u2013 the US central bank \u2013 has signalled that it is prepared to cut interest rates to boost growth amid signs that the world\u2019s biggest economy is weakening. Private sector job hires \u2013 as measured by the ADP national employment report on Wednesday \u2013 stood at just 27,000 \u2013 the weakest for nearly a decade. Lagarde said while there was some evidence that the global economy might be stabilising there were \u201cstumbling blocks\u201d that could prevent a rebound. \u201cMost importantly, there are growing concerns over the impact of the current trade tensions. The risk is that the most recent US-China tariffs could further reduce investment, productivity and growth. The just-proposed US tariffs on Mexico are also of concern,\u201d she added in a blog post to accompany the IMF\u2019s surveillance report on the state of the global economy. \u201cThese are self-inflicted wounds that must be avoided. How? By removing the recently implemented trade barriers and by avoiding further barriers in whatever form.\u201d Trump has said US tariffs are designed to protect workers in America\u2019s industrial heartlands from unfair Chinese competition, but Lagarde said the result was higher prices. \u201cThe fact is that protectionist measures are not only hurting growth and jobs, but they are also making tradable consumer goods less affordable \u2013 and disproportionately harming low-income households.\u201d Lagarde\u2019s intervention followed the latest half-yearly health check on the global economy from the World Bank, which said Trump\u2019s trade wars with China, Mexico and Europe had sent global investment tumbling. The IMF\u2019s sister organisation predicted that the upshot of increased political uncertainty would push down world growth to 2.6% this year \u2013 its weakest since 2016."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
