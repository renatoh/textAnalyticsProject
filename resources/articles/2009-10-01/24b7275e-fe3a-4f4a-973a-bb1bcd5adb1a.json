Leinster, the holders, and London Irish were seen as the thoroughbreds of the quartet but suddenly the Scarlets have shown a hint of the European pedigree which has been lacking in the region in recent times. The three-time semi-finalists had won only one of their previous 13 Heineken Cup matches, highlighting the significance of this two-try victory over Brive, who with nine different nationalities on board were making a first appearance in the competition for 11 years. It was not a particularly convincing win, despite the Scarlets enjoying a wealth of territory and possession. But it was a case of never mind the quality, feel the victory, as the Scarlets coach Nigel Davies revealed. \"We just had to win this game.The players knew that we had to win and that adds pressure,\" he said. \"But we came in with a focus and played the game we wanted to play. Overall, it was the start we needed, and we know that Saturday is an altogether different challenge.\" That challenge is a tough trip to the Madejski to take on an Irish side buoyed by dismantling the reigning champions in Dublin on Friday. The problem for the Scarlets is whether they have enough depth to win away from home. They will sorely miss the New Zealander Regan King, who is out of action until Christmas. But the switching of Sean Lamont, the Scotland international, from wing to centre proved canny, and he was the meat in the sandwich for the Scarlets' opening try created by Stephen Jones \u2013 who passed 2,500 points for the region on Saturday \u2013 and finished by Lee Williams. That try came from the final play of the first half. Their second arrived at the end of the second when the replacement prop Rhys Thomas crashed over after a Stephen Jones penalty rebounded off a post. The most impressive part of the victory was the influential part played by the back row, most notably David Lyons, who pipped Dafydd Jones to the man of the match award. While Scarlets take on Irish, Brive will be trying to lasso a wounded animal in the form of Leinster. But Andy Goode, one of four Englishmen in Brive's line-up, believes Pool Six is not as predictable as it first appeared. \"It's wide open now,\" said the former Leicester outside-half. \"We're in a bloody tough group. Leinster will be reeling from Friday night's game. You don't want to be losing your home games.\" Scarlets Evans (Priestland, h-t); Williams, Lamont, Davies (Higgitt, 33), M Jones (capt); S Jones, Roberts; I Thomas (John, 51), Rees (Owens, 48), Manu (R Thomas, 51), Reed, Day (Cooper, 69), Easterby (Pugh, 69), D Jones, D Lyons.
