This team, one of the youngest ever to play in a World Cup, beat Argentina, Australia and New Zealand \u2013 the latter two in successive weeks. As the retired head of a sports college, I know we won\u2019t inspire the next generation if we perpetuate the idea that the only people of any value are the ones who lift the trophy and, in England\u2019s case, ignore the humble and talented squad who prepared so wholeheartedly in order to represent their country in a fiercely intense competition. Their arrival time should have been publicised so that we could have given them a heroes\u2019 welcome.
