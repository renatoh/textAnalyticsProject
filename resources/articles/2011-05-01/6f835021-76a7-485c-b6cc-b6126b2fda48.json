If the impressive Soane Tonga'uiha gets the upper hand then Leinster will be in trouble, but they have the ability to change their gameplan if they are losing the scrum. Mike Ross has had a massive season, breaking into the international side and leading Ireland's scrum, when many didn't expect him to be playing on the world stage. Tonga'uiha is the most powerful player in the scrum in the northern hemisphere at the moment and Ross will struggle unless he gets his height right. Cullen v Lawes Both of these players are pivotal in the line-out. Leinster's captain, Leo Cullen, has the ability to make the right call at the right time but is not as athletic as his opposite number Courtney Lawes, below. His decision-making could be key in the lineout. Lawes has been a star player for Northampton and will need to perform. His athleticism gives him an advantage but Northampton's chances may depend on his decisions during the lineout, especially if Tom Wood is not fit to play in the final. Nacewa v Foden Both are very good counterattacking players and it is a case of who gets the better opportunities to run at the defences that could be the difference between the two sides. Isa Nacewa is one of the most in-form full-backs in the northern hemisphere. He is a very exciting player and could break through the Northampton defence with his pace, although he is not as fast as his opposite number. Ben Foden has an extra yard of pace over Nacewa, which could be vital when they get the opportunity. He is another exciting player and could prove to be the difference. Sexton v Myler The battle of the two number No10s will depend on where they are fed the ball and how they react to the pressure. Jonathan Sexton has the experience of big games and his kicking has been excellent in these situations. He also won the Heineken Cup in 2009, which could play to his advantage. Stephen Myler, on the other hand, is relatively inexperienced in these situations and his place-kicking under pressure has not always been up to the level required. At the moment, Sexton has the advantage over Myler. D'Arcy v Downey Gordon D'Arcy has the better footwork and the international experience to win the battle of the centres, but James Downey has the extra size over D'Arcy, which he will look to use to his advantage. Downey will also want to prove a point by getting one up on his international rival as it is harder to catch the selectors' eyes when playing in England \u2013 this provides him with his best chance to impress, especially in a World Cup year. You could see against Munster he was looking to prove a point. Schmidt v Mallinder Both of them are excellent coaches with experience to draw upon. Josef Schmidt, below, has settled into the top job at Leinster really well after arriving from Clermont Auvergne and has had success in a very short space of time. Some of his side's performances have been some of the best I have seen from a club side for a long time. Jim Mallinder has achieved a lot at Northampton, after a spell in charge of England Saxons. When his side lose he is seen to have a smile on his face. This takes the pressure off the players, which is beneficial to them.
