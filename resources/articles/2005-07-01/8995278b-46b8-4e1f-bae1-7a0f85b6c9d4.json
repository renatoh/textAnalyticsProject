The group, which last month acquired the betting estate of the rival group Stanley Leisure for \u00a3505m, benefited from outcomes at Royal Ascot, which this year took place at York, as well as two high-profile football games, both drawn after 90 minutes. They were the Champions League final between Liverpool and AC Milan and the FA Cup final between Manchester and Arsenal. Football fans less frequently back a draw. These outcomes helped the group to report flat comparable gross win in the six months to June 28. The surprise victory of Greece in Euro 2004 had added \u00a311m to William Hill's gross win. The bookmaker has also cut its wage bill, especially for overtime. Operating expenses, which rose 7.6% in the first four months, were up just 4.4% for the half-year. William Hill is in talks with the Office of Fair Trading over which betting shops it must sell to meet competition rules over acquiring Stanley's 624 sites. It is likely to have to sell about 60 of its 2,200 shops. Shares in Wm Hill closed up 11p at 551p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
