Tear down the system that protects harassers", "bodyText": "Susan Fowler has a simple explanation for her decision to become a whistleblower: It was her only option. The software engineer had no idea that a blogpost detailing her experience of sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber would spread across the globe and pave the way for the ousting of the company\u2019s CEO, Travis Kalanick, and many powerful men in tech. The impetus for publishing the 2,900-word story was an obscure legal clause that prevented her from seeking justice in court. \u201cI was appalled I had unwittingly signed away my constitutional rights,\u201d the 26-year-old told the Guardian. \u201cSomebody had to step up.\u201d Fowler, whose name has become synonymous with the fight for gender equality in the workplace, is now using her accidental celebrity status to fight what\u2019s known as \u201cforced arbitration\u201d. It\u2019s a practice that allows companies to push employee complaints into secretive hearings, which hide labor violations from the public, silence victims with non-disclosure agreements and often protect serial offenders. The system has been widely used for decades, but the standards of what\u2019s acceptable in corporate America have dramatically shifted since Fowler came forward. Much of the contemporary #MeToo reckoning can, in fact, be traced back to her 19 February 2017 blog, which foreshadowed the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the uncovering of sexual harassment and abuse in entertainment, media, publishing and a plethora of industries. Fowler is modest about her impact and in a recent wide-ranging interview said she remained surprised about her fame in the tech world and beyond: \u201cI\u2019m still processing.\u201d Although she\u2019s outspoken on Twitter and graced the cover of Time magazine alongside Taylor Swift and Ashley Judd as the \u201cSilence Breakers\u201d Person of the Year, Fowler said she is \u201creally introverted and really shy\u201d, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to get out there and talk.\u201d But speaking about arbitration and new California legislation to combat the practice comes easily to Fowler, who is now on maternity leave from her job at the tech company Stripe: \u201cThis would be the biggest thing you could do to stop the cycle of harassment, discrimination and retaliation in the workplace.\u201d Part of the reason her account of \u201cOne Very, Very Strange Year At Uber\u201d went so viral was that by all measures it seemed she did everything right to speak up about documented and blatant harassment \u2013 yet was failed at every step. She alleged that as soon as she was hired, a manager sent her inappropriate messages over the company chat, but that HR brushed aside her complaint and told her to find another team. Fowler wrote that the company protected this man despite claims from multiple female engineers, and despite evidence of numerous instances of discrimination, a manager threatened to fire her if she continued reporting to HR. Eventually, she quit. \u201cI think about what I went through and even worse what I saw some of my co-workers go through,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand I think what would make it so this would never happen again?\u201d The stories of abuse Fowler has heard since speaking out have been devastating, she added: \u201cThey ruin lives. They destroy careers. This is such unnecessary suffering.\u201d Fowler said she was shocked when she realized that Uber effectively forced all its workers as a condition of employment to waive their basic rights to even allege labor violations in court. And so did every other company in the industry and beyond. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how systemic of an issue it was.\u201d Fowler, who said she no longer uses Uber to get around, has recently been outspoken about another population affected by her former company\u2019s tactics \u2013 passengers who say they were sexually assaulted by drivers. In March, court records revealed that the company has tried to stop a class-action lawsuit by forcing women into individual private arbitration, a move that critics say would cover up a pattern of abuse. Fowler is now advocating for a proposed California bill that would prohibit employers from forcing staff to waive their right to bring labor claims in court. In addition to women in tech, the legislation aims to support vulnerable low-wage and \u201cgig economy\u201d workers who suffer wage theft, discrimination, harassment, assault and other abuses, but are often unable to file complaints due to mandatory arbitration clauses, said the California assembly member Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, who is introducing the bill next week. \u201cYou have women from all walks of life really standing together and saying, hey this affects all of us.\u201d California often leads the nation in progressive labor protections, but corporations have used arbitration to essentially erase those gains, added Caitlin Vega, the legislative director of the California Labor Federation, the bill\u2019s sponsor: \u201cOur goal is to restore workers\u2019 access to a fair and open process.\u201d While companies like Uber and Google say they strive to be leaders in diversity and inclusion, they have openly resisted these reforms. Microsoft announced it was ending forced arbitration in harassment cases earlier this year, but no other big companies have followed. Fowler argued that the industry\u2019s stubborn commitment to the status quo directly impedes diversity efforts at the notoriously male-dominated tech firms. Fowler said she recently met YouTube\u2019s CEO, Susan Wojcicki, after an event and asked her if she would consider waiving mandatory arbitration clauses. The Google executive wasn\u2019t very receptive, Fowler said. Uber\u2019s new CEO also recently told Fowler on Twitter he would \u201ctake a look\u201d at her suggestion, but it\u2019s unclear if the company is considering reforms or would oppose the legislation. An Uber spokesperson claimed the company currently has an \u201copt-out provision\u201d for arbitration, but declined to say when it was adopted or comment further. Google did not respond to inquiries. Fowler said her newborn daughter motivates her to continue fighting and using the massive platform she never imagined she would have: \u201cI realize that I have people listening to me, and I can\u2019t squander that opportunity.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
