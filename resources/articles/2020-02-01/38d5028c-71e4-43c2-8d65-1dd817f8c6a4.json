Immediately after the announcement there was shouting and booing among the audience, and the two actors who announced the award quickly left the stage. More than 100 angry protestors had gathered to demonstrate against the honour for the controversial director, who is still wanted in the US after pleading guilty to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old but fleeing before being sentenced in 1977. Even after Polanski announced he would not be attending the C\u00e9sars awards ceremony for fear of what he described as a \u201cpublic lynching\u201d, protesters gathered outside the venue to vent their fury at his film J\u2019Accuse/An Officer and a Spy being nominated for 12 awards. The awards evening opened with the French actor and comedian Florence Foresti, who was hosting the event, announcing \u201cPredators, producers, gentlemen with an electronic bracelet \u2026\u201d Polanski\u2019s film was given an early C\u00e9sar for best costumes, but there was nobody from the production team to collect the prize. It won the second of its three awards for best adaptation. Caroline Fourest, a filmmaker, author and columnist at Marianne magazine, said the C\u00e9sar judges had rewarded \u201cPolanski and not his work \u2026 as well as a 100% masculine film\u201d. Earlier in the day France\u2019s culture minister entered the row saying that to give the controversial director a C\u00e9sar would send the wrong signals. Franck Riester\u2019s comments came hours after Polanski, 87, said he would not attend Friday\u2019s awards ceremony for fear of being subject to a \u201cpublic lynching\u201d by feminists. Women\u2019s rights activists are furious the judges gave the director\u2019s latest film numerous nominations. \u201cIt\u2019s for each judge to take responsibility. It would be a bad symbol given the necessary awareness we all need to have in the fight against sexual and gender-based violence,\u201d Riester told France Info radio on Friday. Polanski\u2019s film, called An Officer and a Spy in English after the Robert Harris novel about the Dreyfus affair, won two prizes at the Venice film festival, including best director. \u201cFantasies of unhealthy minds are now treated as proven facts,\u201d Polanski said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cWe know how this evening will play out.\u201d This latest case has relaunched the debate over Polanski\u2019s place in French \u2013 and world \u2013 cinema, and whether his work can or should be regarded as separate from the man. Earlier, protestors sprayed anti-Polanski graffiti outside the venue and the headquarters of the French film academy, the Acad\u00e9mie des C\u00e9sars. Ad\u00e8le Haenel, the star of Portrait de la Jeune Fille en Feu (Portrait of a Lady on Fire), which has also been nominated for several C\u00e9sars, warned she would boycott the event if Polanski attended. She has accused another French director, Christophe Ruggia, of sexually harassing her when she was 12. \u201cDistinguishing Polanski is spitting in the face of all victims,\u201d Haenel told the New York Times, adding that nominating him \u201cmeans raping women isn\u2019t that bad\u201d. \u201cThere is a #MeToo paradox in France: it is one of the countries where the movement was the most closely followed on social media, but from a political perspective and in cultural spheres, France has completely missed the boat.\u201d She said France had failed to draw the line between \u201clibertine behaviour\u201d and \u201csexual abuse\u201d. The renewed controversy came weeks after the academy resigned en masse. Alain Terzian, its president, had defended the decision to honour Polanski\u2019s film, saying it was not the institution\u2019s role to take \u201ca moral stance\u201d when it came to awards. An open letter signed by more than 200 actors, producers and directors had demanded \u201cprofound reform\u201d of the academy, saying it was stuck in the past and criticising its lack of transparency. The French feminist group Osez le F\u00e9minisme (Dare to be Feminist) accused the C\u00e9sars committee of being a \u201csexist institution that makes women invisible\u201d. Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, France\u2019s equality minister, suggested French cinema was still behind the times and had \u201cyet to complete its awakening, its revolution\u201d. It is not the first time anger and protests centred on Polanski have disrupted the C\u00e9sars. In 2017, Polanski was named to preside over the awards ceremony but stepped down after a wave of outrage. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 March 2020 because an earlier version misnamed the French minister for equality, Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, as Marl\u00e8ne Schiapparelli.
