The industry is set to receive the go-ahead from the government for two 65,000 tonne aircraft carriers worth more than \u00a33bn - the largest warships ever built in the UK. This follows orders for destroyers and Astute submarines. But the orders are tied to increased consolidation and a new approach to defence work as part of the government's Defence Industrial Strategy. Lord Drayson, defence procurement minister, and the industry have agreed to make the defence business more efficient. This could lead to a reduction in the number of operators in defence work as well as increasing cooperation with other countries. The new approach allows the companies to shift the shipbuilding industry out of the era of boom and bust. Executives have said in the past that companies would gear up to meet an order in terms of skills and other resources, only to have to lay off personnel with key skills once the contract was over. Consolidation is under way among Britain's leading defence contractors. BAE Systems and VT Group, which have a joint venture in support services, are working on a similar venture within the shipbuilding and naval support sector. Meanwhile, bidding is under way for control of the Devonport Management Services business (DML) in Plymouth. KBR which was spun out of Halliburton, the US oil services firm last year, is under pressure to sell its 51% stake in DML after falling out with the Ministry of Defence. This followed the company's failure to comply with a UK request for financial data ahead of its initial public offering. BAE is said to be among the bidders and if it wins, would command an even more dominant position within the shipbuilding and support industry. The Ministry of Defence is undertaking a review of its three naval bases, at Rosyth, Plymouth and Portsmouth. All options are on the table, though the industry is betting the MoD will make cuts at all three, rather than close one. Both the carrier go-ahead and the BAE/VT tie-up are said to have made progress and events could even move forward before parliament rises later today. But the carrier decision could be delayed by elections to the Scottish parliament, Welsh assembly and local elections in England on May 3. If BAE does clinch the deal with VT and becomes, de facto, the dominant partner and if it acquires KBR's stake in DML, the company would have an unrivalled position. But both are big ifs. Though shipbuilding accounts for only around 20% of its business, VT group is unlikely to simply stand aside to allow BAE free rein. BAE has not confirmed it has made a bid to win control of DML and is likely to face stiff competition from companies such as Babcock International and General Dynamics from the US. Yet its ambitions constitute a sea change of opinion within Britain's biggest defence company. It is only a few years ago that BAE was wondering privately about the possibility of quitting the sector entirely. BAE owns the Scotstoun and Govan shipyards on the Clyde, the nuclear submarine building yard at Barrow, as well as the existing joint venture with VT Group, Fleet Support Ltd (FLS), which operates an MoD site at Portsmouth. If it secures a deal with VT on shipbuilding and acquires control of DML, Babcock, which owns the Rosyth dockyard and runs the Faslane submarine base for the MoD, would be its only rival. The government's Defence Industrial Strategy aims to ensure Britain retains the capability to meet its own defence needs. It has been pushing the concept of \"through-life capability\" where companies not only build equipment but maintain, repair and upgrade it through its operational life. Within the shipbuilding and support sector, it appears to accept that is likely to mean fewer bidders for its orders, though how the industry restructures itself is regarded as a matter for the companies themselves. The carrier order is an example of the way the industry is cooperating: it is being built by an alliance of BAE, VT, Babcock and the defence electronics company, Thales but just one supplier. The flexible approach has allowed the UK to sign a memorandum of understanding with France, under which the French will use the UK design, with modifications, and the two countries are looking at possible economies of scale. It is, however, a moot question whether the MoD would be entirely happy if BAE achieves the naval pre-eminence, both in submarine and surface vessels, it threatens to acquire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
