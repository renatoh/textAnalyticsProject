It might have been the unfamiliar chest-high full tosses. It might have been the fact that the bat was distinctly narrower than the ones he grew up with. It might have been that his elegant cover-driver's follow-through wasn't quite right for the job in hand. For Alan Fordham, the former Northamptonshire opening batsman, the $10m contract with the Baltimore Orioles is presumably still in the post. But his brief, quite promising attempt at batting practice at Oriole Park this weekend might just have started something even more significant: a rapprochement between the long-lost brothers among stick-and-ball games, baseball and cricket. Fordham, the cricket operations manager of the England and Wales Cricket Board, came to the US on a brief visit along with David Acfield, the former Essex off-spinner who is now the board's chairman of cricket. The trip was suggested by the Guardian, and taken up enthusiastically by the ECB chairman David Morgan. In terms of subversively Americanising two influential Lord's figures, the venture was an unqualified success. Last Friday afternoon, neither man knew a thing about baseball. By Saturday night they were arguing about strategy. By Sunday they were searching for any game they could find on their hotel tellies. Had he stayed 24 hours longer, I suspect Acfield would have gone into expert-summariser mode, muttering that in his day baseball was much better, and he couldn't understand what was going off out there. That wasn't quite the object of the exercise, which was to find common ground between the two sports, and lessons which cricket might learn to attract the public. They found the common ground all right. Here are two traditional, rather cerebral, summer games, struggling to maintain their ascendancy in tough economies which have thousands of other more accessible activities competing for public attention. Acfield's conversation with Spiro Alafassos, the communications director of the Orioles, indicated almost uncanny similarities. For instance, although Latino players are an increasing force in baseball, very few Hispanic spectators turn up at the games - a paradox reflecting that of English cricket and Asians. In both cases, market research has identified the same barrier: potential fans say: \"We don't feel very welcome.\" Acfield just kept nodding vigorously. Perhaps it helped that the hosts, like English cricket, are having a particularly hard time. Oriole Park, which revolutionised sporting architecture a decade ago by being both modern and beautiful, used to be 48,000-full night after night. Now the Orioles team are struggling, crowds are plummeting and officials are having to be ever more inventive to try to reverse the trend, with kids' clubs, special season-ticket offers, giveaways and rock concerts. Perhaps it helped too that the weather, atypically, was as cold and damp as you would expect at Lord's in mid-May. \"One of the nice things about coming here is the sense that we're not a million miles from what they're doing,\" said Acfield. \"A year or two back we might have been. You think, here are these great marketeers, but actually we are on the same track, and I'm quite pleased with that.\" The entertainment planned for the counties' new 20-over tournament being launched next month is likely to have many echoes of baseball. But the real lesson of baseball for cricket is not in the razzmatazz, it being unlikely that the Lord's pavilion will ever rise as one during the tea interval to dance to YMCA. It lies in the details, which apply just as much to the most traditional occasion as they do to the floodlit hocus-pocus. The visitors were hugely impressed by the players' pictures - even more relevant in cricket, given the batsmen's helmeted anonymity - that flashed up on the screen. They liked the constant flow of information. And they liked the sense of service. When the steward faced us on arrival in the stands, he did not just grudgingly let us pass, he showed us to our seats - and wiped the rain off them. \"A lovely touch,\" said Fordham. \"I don't think there's one great big idea we can take back,\" said Acfield. \"But we've picked up a lot of little ideas and thoughts that we can add to what we already know.\" This is not necessarily a one-way street. Baseball wants to be friends too, and this trip had good support from the game's foreign policy wing, Major League Baseball International. Like cricket, it is anxious for global expansion and at present its reach is far less impressive: outside the US, baseball is a major sport in Japan, South Korea and parts of Central America (with maybe Iraq to come). It is now being kicked out of the Olympics for being insufficiently international. The major league season would have started in Japan this year, but the trip was junked because of the war. The game's rulers are eyeing up London for a similar visit. They have tried playing at The Oval, but the field is so huge the sightlines are all wrong. Lord's, now... that might be different. Unthinkable? No more than World Cup cricket in the US, and that's inked in for 2007."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
