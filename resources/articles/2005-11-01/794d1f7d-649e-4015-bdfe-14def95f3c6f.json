Aidan Barclay is the son of Sir David Barclay. In a preview of Funny, How Thin The Line Is: Documents from the Atlas Group Archive at the FACT Museum, Liverpool, page 37, the Guide, November 12, we referred to the accompanying exhibit, Disappeared in America, as a fictional creation of the Atlas Group. The Disappeared in America project is not a fictional creation of the Atlas Group or Walid Raad. The project was created by Visible Collective, a New York-based arts collective, and looks at issues of migration and national identity. It looks at cases of Muslim migrants after 9/11. In a report Council votes to oppose ID cards, posted on our website, November 23, we incorrectly referred to Bristol city LibDem councillor Mark Wright as Andy, and Conservative councillor John Goulandris as Bill. This has now been corrected. Apologies to both. Ted Bruning is the editor of Camra's journal, What's Brewing, not Roger Protz as we suggested (Diary, November 23), who edits their guide. In a panel accompanying a report, Miracle berry lets Japanese dieters get sweet from sour, page 19, November 25, we referred to \"gingko\". We should have said ginkgo. \u00b7 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible. Please quote the date and page number.
