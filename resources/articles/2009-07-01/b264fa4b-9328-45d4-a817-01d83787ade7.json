Griffiths, as students of the supernatural will recall, was the chairman of an independent Premier League tribunal which was able to peer into the past and declare with certainty that West Ham, and not Sheffield United, would have be relegated at the end of the 2006\u201307 season had not the Argentinian been allowed to play for the Hammers. We won't revisit that subject, you will be relieved to hear, especially not now that Tevez has chosen this moment to make his debut contribution to what I believe literary types like to describe as counter-factual history, arguing that the outcome of the European Cup final between Barcelona and Manchester United might have been different had Sir Alex Ferguson used another starting 11, one featuring, well, I think we can all guess. \"You cannot argue with Alex Ferguson,\" Tevez said. \"He is like the president of England. It is impossible. You always lose. But he made a mistake to leave me on the bench. That was the only final the team had lost since I had been at Manchester United.\" Tevez's notion of a republican England is certainly appealing (albeit with a different president) but the suggestion he would have altered the course of the European Cup final stretches credulity tighter than a Lycra bandana round the circumference of Cristiano Ronaldo's ego. The Argentinian did, after all, come on at half-time in Rome to no noticeable effect, although I seem to remember that Barcelona were even more dominant after the interval than before. It was hardly Tevez's fault that Xavi and Iniesta ran the show almost from the start, but in accepting his limited culpability for United's defeat it is also worth asking, how on earth would his presence on the pitch from the first minute have halted Bar\u00e7a's midfield pair? Those inclined to debate Ferguson's team selection and tactics in perpetuity are welcome to do so, but most sensible people would choose to accept the result as fair, move on and interpret Tevez's latest criticisms of his now former manager as the bitter words of a player still playing to an Old Trafford audience he has left behind. Sour grapes, some might call it. There is nothing inherently evil about a professional footballer slagging off his former manager, even if that manager happens to be the most successful in the modern era of English football, but it is patently absurd to pass off such self-centred whining as the final verdict on what might have been. Tevez was a good player for United \u2014 not a great one, and certainly not one who was worth the additional \u00a325m it would have cost to secure a permanent move to Old Trafford \u2014 but he was a squad player, not a defining member of the team. So he didn't play from the start in Rome, or start in as many league matches as he would have liked. Big deal. Perhaps if he had scored more frequently when he did play, things might have been different. In recent years the balance of power within the game, especially at the highest levels, has shifted decisively in favour of the players, and thank heavens for that. Even \"presidents\" like Alex Ferguson have accepted they no longer have the leverage they once had. Not only do great players get paid astronomical sums of money, they can behave pretty as much as they like, as Ronaldo seems intent on proving. In return, clubs can ask that the players live up to their reputations and their salaries. Failing that, they are entitled to expect that he keeps himself fit, keeps the whining to a minimum and puts the interests of the team before the ego. In other words, acts like a well-remunerated professional. Tevez would do well to learn this before he crosses the city of Manchester, especially if Samuel Eto'o arrives at Eastlands and halfway through the season Mark Hughes discovers he only has enough room in his team for one centre-forward who isn't quite as magnificent as he thinks he is. Blinkered De Villiers is blind to his obligations The responsibilities of a head coach or a manager were once restricted to the formulation of match tactics and the motivation of his players. He was answerable only to the results sheet. But no more. These days, the coach is not only required to win matches but also to set an example for his players and for the watching world. By any measure South Africa's Peter de Villiers failed miserably in this part of the job with his surreal \u2013 there is no other word, surely \u2013 defence of Schalk Burger's eye-gouging in the second Test against the Lions. One has to wonder what on earth the South Africa coach would consider worthy of a card. Apologies have since been made but they have been half-hearted and have come with the usual caveats about the \"mischievous\" press making a Table Mountain out of a Primrose Hill. It is too glib to suggest that De Villiers should be fired for his conduct \u2013 it won't happen. Far better instead that he be remembered not as a coach who fashioned a magnificent rugby team but as an irresponsible leader who gave his players the green light to commit wanton acts of violence. Millions of reasons why Gazidis salary plan will fail Leaving aside the ludicrous hype of David Beckham's arrival in Los Angeles, Major League Soccer in the States has been a model of how to develop a \"minority\" sport in a hostile environment. For this, Ivan Gazidis, the league's former deputy commissioner and marketing genius, can take a good deal of credit. He's a smart man and Arsenal did themselves a favour in hiring him as the club's new chief executive. His job, presumably, is to take some of the ideas that worked in the States and apply them over here, although when it comes to improving the English game one hopes Gazidis can come up with something more original than a US-style \"salary cap\". \"Clubs have a duty to see how we can provide more stability in our business models and the salary cap, or some form of wage restraint, is one element that is worth looking at,'' he tells my colleague David Conn today. Does he mean concepts like the MLS's developmental player's salary, whereby a youngster can be paid about \u00a314,000 a year while his illustrious team-mate is pulling in \u00a34m. Good luck with that. And good luck, too, with trying to pass off an attempt by club owners to enrich themselves further at the expense of the players as simply an effort to \"provide more stability in our business models\". Traditionalists' roof lament is just a shot in the dark The roof came on at Wimbledon and the empire (or what's left of it) didn't fall. No surprise there, then. Nor was there much surprise when the \"traditionalists\" used the occasion of Monday night's epic under the lights of Centre Court to complain about the sad passing of an era. Nothing is sacred, apparently. We can only hope so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
