It was issues such as illegal bookies, armed robbers and Peter Savill's Levy demands - robbery of a different sort, to the mind of many of them then - that dominated the discussions. These days, though, they can talk of little else and the same seems to go for Savill, too. The bookies and the British Horseracing Board are no longer on opposite sides of the funding question, since racing's income is now tied to bookmakers' gross profits rather than turnover. Big profits on racing are good news for both parties, and both perceive the exchanges as a threat to their future prosperity. Several speakers at yesterday's AGM of the Association of British Bookmakers suggested that exchanges enjoy unfair tax advantages over traditional bookmakers, that they are depressing the margins of the off-course betting business, and allow anyone to do what previously only licensed bookies could do, that is, lay horses to lose rather than back them to win. And no sooner had they all sat down to lunch than the British Horseracing Board released details of the oral evidence that Savill, its chairman, will today provide to a parliamentary committee chaired by John Greenway MP, which is currently scrutinising the draft of the government's long-awaited gambling bill. For veterans of the long, bitter struggle between racing and bookmakers over the money that one should receive from the other, it can still seem strange to find Savill and his former antagonists standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the same choir. But when he arrives in Westminster this morning, Savill will push the line in the BHB's earlier written submission to the same committee, which the board also published yesterday. This includes a claim that \"the scale and international nature of betting exchanges represent an unprecedented and substantial threat to the integrity of racing,\" and also suggests that \"the taxation of betting exchanges creates an unlevel playing field which ... [gives] betting exchanges an unfair advantage and results in less money flowing to government and racing.\" The board's proposed solu tion to this perceived threat is to force exchanges to distinguish between \"recreational\" and \"non-recreational\" layers of horses according to the volume of their business. \"Non-recreational\" bet-layers would then require a licence, like any high street bookie, with their profits being taxed accordingly. Savill's suggestions to the committee would no doubt find favour with most of the audience at the bookmakers' AGM. However, another of the speakers at yesterday's event was Lord McIntosh, the minister with responsibility for gambling issues, and he made it clear that the government sees things rather differently. \"We know your views and we know ours, and we don't seem to have found common ground,\" Lord McIntosh said, \"but I can assure you that it is not for the lack of any forceful representation on the part of the Association of British Bookmakers.\" The Jockey Club and a number of leading bookmakers will also give evidence to the parliamentary committee today, as part of the process that will eventually lead to the final gambling bill. The club will be represented by Christopher Foster, its executive director, who will suggest that the sport's regulators need greater powers to root out possible corruption. \"The most effective deterrent [to malpractice] will be successful prosecutions by the Gambling Commission or the Jockey Club,\" Foster said yesterday. \"This means the Gambling Commission must be fully resourced to utilise the powers given to it to investigate and prosecute effectively.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
