The US global Aids coordinator, Randall Tobias, praised the success of Uganda, where the ABC has helped lower rates of infection. However, what you did not report is how the Bush administration has cynically reinterpreted the act's proposed use of the ABC, and threatened its effectiveness. Rather than promoting a universal understanding of the ABC (the reason for success in Uganda), Mr Tobias directs a balkanised approach: teaching A for Abstinence to youth, B for Be faithful to married people, and C for Condomise to those at risk, particularly sex workers. Geoffrey Silver Director, Our Hiv ABC The National Aids Trust welcomes the government's decision to extend disability discrimination legislation to include HIV-positive people from the moment of diagnosis (Mentally ill to get work protection, July 16). However, the bill still excludes large groups of people who experience daily discrimination as a result of being perceived to be HIV-positive - including carers and partners of HIV-positive people. The proposed changes will not protect these people under the law and fails to bring equality legislation in the UK up to the high standards of countries such as Australia.
