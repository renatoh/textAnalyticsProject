Leo Anyway, enough about uni, I can't go on talking about old times for ever. What were you saying about your co-worker? Raya Oh, Simon? Nothing. He's a bit of a nose-breather, is all. Leo That's so funny. I knew a cracking chap named Simon. Raya Did you? Was that at Oxford? Leo I guess it was. I could tell you hilarious stories about him. Raya Probably best if you didn't. I should get back soon. Leo Where did you go to uni? Raya I told you before - Leeds. Leo Oh, yes. I thought you met my sister at Oxford. Raya No, we're in the same book club. Leo I've heard it's a lovely city. Bit different from where I went, Oxford. Raya I know. Leo So strange - you get down here to London and realise how many people in the world didn't. Raya Didn't what? Leo Well, go to Oxford... Raya Continents full of them. Leo I had a job interview with someone who was at Luton. He was interviewing me. We looked the same age. [Pause] Raya It takes such a long time to get the bill here. [Pause] Leo So... Actually, my sister said you might point me towards a job. Raya I told her we have no openings. Leo I have to find a job soon. I bet your parents don't have such strict rules. Raya My parents aren't alive. Leo Mine are a bit too alive, if you get my drift. It's just my sister said she had a schoolfriend who could help me. Raya We're not schoolfriends. I told her, we have an internship. Leo Right. The problem is, I sort of have all the training I need. Raya But we don't have proof of that. Leo Well, in terms of proof, I did go... Raya To Oxford? Leo Well, yes. Raya I'd no idea. I'll keep that in mind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
