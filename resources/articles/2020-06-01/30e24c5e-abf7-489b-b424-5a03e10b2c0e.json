Here was a play, pulled after three previews because of the Covid-19 pandemic, written by Winsome Pinnock, the first black woman to have a play staged at the National Theatre, directed by Miranda Cromwell and produced by the Manchester Royal Exchange. It had form. What the BBC had no way of knowing was that its broadcast this weekend on Radio 3 would come at the end of almost three weeks of protests, statue-toppling and soul searching triggered by the killing of George Floyd. It is impossible to imagine a more timely contribution to the Black Lives Matter campaign. Pinnock who, in her own words, is \u201cdescended from enslaved people\u201d, takes as her starting point Slave Ship by JMW Turner. First seen in 1840, it is an astonishing image of a broiling sea beneath swirling orange clouds, the sun casting a golden glow over the turbulence. In the watery distance a spindly ship rises at a precarious angle, while human hands emerge almost imperceptibly from the depths. Turner\u2019s original title was Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying, Typhoon Coming On. \u201cWhy does he make something so ugly beautiful?\u201d asks one of Pinnock\u2019s characters. The play takes a similarly swirling journey through the light and shade of black history. Central is Kiza Deen\u2019s Lou, a TV actor famed for futuristic voyages as the star of a US sci-fi series. She\u2019s been cast in a movie about Turner to celebrate the bicentenary of the Slave Trade Act of 1807, but she discovers that the producers care more for the white abolitionists than the black slaves. She is being written out of her own story. She calls it \u201ctorture porn\u201d. Like the protesters who threw the statue of Edward Colston into Bristol harbour, Pinnock sees the past sitting side by side with the present, forever needling, provoking, agitating \u2013 as restless and as uncontainable as a Turner seascape. \u2022 Rockets and Blue Lights is available on BBC Radio 3."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
