I assume that a cable will be necessary to connect the two machines. Should I run both machines for a while to familiarise myself with Vista? I also intend staying with my current ISP and understand that I will need some help from them to enable the service on my new laptop. Geoff Cadman JS: There are several programs traditionally used to migrate between PCs. The main ones include Eisenworld's Aloha Bob PC Relocator Ultra Control (which can move programs) and Detto's cheaper IntelliMover (which can't). Microsoft helped by adding a Files and Settings Transfer Wizard to the System Tools folder in Windows XP. Today, your best bet is Vista's built-in Windows Easy Transfer, which is based on Aloha Bob. However, to move programs, you will also need to download the Windows Easy Transfer Companion (Beta) from Microsoft (tinyurl.com/3yupab). The Vista team has produced a step-by-step guide to using WET (tinyurl.com/2gfvjg), while Windows Networking.com provides a walkthrough with many more screen grabs (tinyurl.com/qhjsj). Note that some programs, such as antivirus software and firewalls, should not or cannot be moved. Windows Easy Transfer and other products can transfer files via various cables, a network or by writing the data to an external hard drive or a CD. Some companies now market USB cables to do the job, such as Belkin's Easy Transfer Cable for Windows Vista. Microsoft allows suppliers to include its transfer software on a CD. I don't think Vista requires much familiarisation for XP users, since you can handle the unfamiliar bits by using the numerous built-in help routines. Also, if there are elements you don't like, you can often revert to a more XP-like way of doing things by selecting Classic mode. CNet TV has a short video, Make Windows Vista look like XP (tinyurl.com/3clw6n). For forward-looking users, the same CNet reporter has done Turn XP into Vista for free (tinyurl.com/28mr7y). Vista does not require any setting up for an internet connection, and ISP software is best avoided: just plug into a standard Ethernet router. If you have the misfortune to use a USB modem, it would be better to junk it. Vista always prefers to use the latest IPv6 version of the Internet Protocol, but if that causes problems, you can set it to prefer IPv4 (tinyurl.com/2a69jl, tinyurl.com/2h6tev). Moving to Leopard I have a 1.6Ghz PowerMac G5 running Mac OS 10.3.9, with 250MB of memory. I am tempted to upgrade to Tiger or Leopard because of the extra advantages with iPhoto and email. Peter Medhurst JS: The new iLife 08 (which includes iPhoto) requires OS X 10.4.9 (Tiger) or later, and that's a paid upgrade, so you might as well buy Leopard (10.5.x) for about \u00a380. That includes email, but you will have to pay for iLife (about \u00a355). You will also need more memory, and adding a gigabyte or more would speed up your PC. Go to the Crucial website (crucial.com/uk/mac), which will analyse your Mac and suggest memory upgrades: you can still buy the chips somewhere else if you want, though I've been happy with Crucial upgrades. But bear in mind that Apple has moved to Intel chips, so PowerPC-based systems like yours are on the way out. Ad blocking I am a disabled oldie who is now unable to tolerate certain sorts of screen movement, flashing lights, etc. My BT Yahoo! mailbox has an advert for an (otherwise admirable) cancer charity which persistently flashes down to obscure my emails. Is there any way of cutting this stuff out? Theresa Levell Clarke JS: There are two simple solutions to this. First, you could switch to the Firefox 2 browser and install AdBlock Plus (adblockplus.org/en/installation) extension, which will cut out the ads . Second, you could switch to Gmail, which doesn't have flashing adverts and also works well with Internet Explorer. I'd suggest you do both. Backed up again After a disastrous data loss, I'm using an external hard drive to back up all my data. Is there software, preferably free, that will only copy new files? I've looked through the Ask Jack site but can't find an obviously similar query! Steve Ballantyne JS: Search Ask Jack for Centred System's Second Copy (centered.com), at $29.95 (\u00a315). An excellent alternative is Karen's Replicator (tinyurl.com/cnta), which is free for personal use. Acronis True Image 11 Home (tinyurl.com/5hh5v) is worth a look too - it's good at copying an entire PC and has a \"just testing\" mode with roll-back features. It's good value at \u00a327.48 (Amazon.co.uk). Backchat \u00b7 Is it time to replace a five-year-old PC? On the Ask Jack blog, Alcib commented: \"The thing to worry about is the hard drive. The older it gets, the more religious you have to be about backups.\" (tinyurl.com/3c7jus) \u00b7 Get your queries answered by Jack Schofield, our computer editor, at jack.schofield@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
