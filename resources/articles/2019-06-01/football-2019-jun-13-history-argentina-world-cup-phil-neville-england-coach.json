Rebuilt in straight lines \u2013 think the north American grid system \u2013 after being razed by appalling second world war bombing, Le Havre does have a growing fan club, along with Unesco world heritage status, but its concrete chic remains an acquired taste. Much the same could be said of Argentina\u2019s sometimes abrasively physical football but, as with the architecture of the host city on Friday , a gritty gameplan must be viewed in its proper context. After receiving negligible backing, both financial and logistical, from their country\u2019s football authorities it seems a small miracle the desperately under-resourced South American squad ranked 37th in the world are here at all. Small wonder the point against Japan \u2013 their first at a World Cup \u2013 was a cause for national celebration. \u201cWe\u2019re going against a team that will sit back and defend and we\u2019ll have limited opportunities,\u201d Neville said. Indeed England\u2019s coach conceded he was impressed by Argentina\u2019s performance on Monday. \u201cI think they took Japan slightly by surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve watched them we\u2019ve never seen them as organised and determined. We\u2019ll have to attack in tight spaces, we\u2019ll have very few chances to receive the ball in easy positions but we\u2019ve done a lot of work on our play in the final third.\u201d As a former England full-back, he is steeped in the rivalry between the men\u2019s teams. \u201cThere\u2019s a great history,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think 86, the Owen goal, the Beckham goal and 2002 Sapporo. What we\u2019ve got to handle tomorrow is a country which is unbelievably proud. They gave their kids 90 minutes off school to watch the Japan game \u2013 that\u2019s what it means to them. They\u2019re going to have that fight. We\u2019ve got to handle the emotion, the occasion. \u201cI\u2019ve told the players this is a proud nation, a big powerful football nation. You are playing against history. When you talk about street football you\u2019re talking about South American players who have grown up with nothing. This is what this Argentine team is.\u201d Jade Moore is likely to be in Neville\u2019s starting XI as the manager almost certainly rotates his squad and has absorbed the message. \u201cIf we have a lot of the ball but don\u2019t score we can\u2019t get frustrated,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cIf we haven\u2019t scored within the first 10, 20, 30 minutes we have to make sure that mentally we\u2019re still in it, that we\u2019re still doing the right things. Hopefully the goals will come. It\u2019ll be a tough game, a physical game. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can underestimate anyone in this World Cup, a lot of games almost turn into cup finals. This one\u2019s going to be a bit more of a fight and we\u2019ll have to make sure we take control and are able to play our football.\u201d Argentina\u2019s hand-to-mouth existence offers England\u2019s increasingly well looked after players a perhaps valuable sense of perspective. \u201cTheirs is an incredible story,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThe things they\u2019re having to fight against really makes us sit back and appreciate where we are and the backing we have from the FA now. \u201cWhen you saw their celebrations against Japan your realised you can\u2019t underestimate them. If we take our foot off the pedal there could be an upset. We should win but if we don\u2019t prepare diligently and do things properly anything can happen; that\u2019s the beauty of the World Cup.\u201d Moore\u2019s knack of delivering defender-destabilising incisive through passes could come in handy. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about making the right decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout moving the ball quickly and stretching them so we can hurt them.\u201d Borrello believes he can limit the damage. \u201cEngland is a great team, and a more vertical team than Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have some things up our sleeves.\u201d Perhaps inevitability he was asked if memories of the Falklands War could influence proceedings. \u201cI don\u2019t think politics have a place,\u201d he replied diplomatically. \u201cThis is about football rivalry and that\u2019s it.\u201d Neville hopes the Argentinian FA will emulate England\u2019s example. \u201cCarlos\u2019s team are at a start of a journey where we were 15 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of my players like Karen Carney and Jill Scott remember turning up to training with no coaches or bibs. The backing we\u2019ve had from the FA is phenomenal, more than I\u2019ve asked for. We feel blessed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
