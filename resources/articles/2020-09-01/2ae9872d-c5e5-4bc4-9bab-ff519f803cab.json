The victors of the past three seasons are through to meet Burnley in round four courtesy of Phil Foden. The 20-year-old is making an ideal start in his bid to fill the vacuum left by David Silva after a performance brimming with vision and end-product. Pep Guardiola gave Ferran Torres, Zack Steffen, Liam Delap and Adri\u00e1n Bernab\u00e9 full debuts and at the final whistle pointed to how depleted his squad is owing to injuries, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Aymeric Laporte being the headline absentees. This means Delap, who scored a memorable first goal, may be retained in the match-day 18 for Leicester\u2019s visit to the Etihad on Sunday. \u201cThe situation we have right now, we have 13 players, he\u2019s with us and can be selected,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we need him. But we cannot forget that Liam is just 17 and he has a lot to improve.\u201d Guardiola praised the academy for its production line. \u201cWe have the process \u2013 Phil and Eric [Garc\u00eda] Tommy [Doyle] or Liam, Cole Palmer [an unused substitute]: exceptional players. Congrats to the academy for these players and all the coaches there.\u201d City lined up in an unfamiliar 4\u20112\u20113\u20111 formation that had Delap at the tip and Rodri and Doyle as a midfield base. The opener was created by the classy Foden with a simple yet incisive ball that removed Bournemouth\u2019s rearguard and had Delap skipping on to it, his left-foot finish hitting the top-right corner. Guardiola was visibly delighted and City were cruising, Doyle particularly enjoying himself at this juncture, illustrated by an immaculate Cruyff turn. Yet in a flash Bournemouth were level via a sweeping sequence that went left to right as David Brooks fed Dan Gosling. He played in Sam Surridge and his finish, low across Steffen\u2019s right, was as emphatic as Delap\u2019s. Here was a test for those less grizzled in the home team, with the lead having lasted four minutes. When Doyle hit a square ball out of play with Foden easy to find it indicated how quickly fortunes had turned. But City gradually rallied. A Kyle Walker ball played to the far post was measured precisely for Delap to strike home but his connection was awry. Ten minutes before the interval Bernab\u00e9 had to be replaced, the Spaniard taken off on a stretcher after apparently suffering a knee injury, with Benjamin Mendy coming on. Walker \u2013 twice \u2013 should have created an opening from the right and a Rodri snap-shot kept Mark Travers, the visiting goalkeeper, alert but at half-time the contest was in the balance. Alive to the potential peril, Guardiola had Kevin De Bruyne and Nathan Ak\u00e9 warming up along the touchline as the second half began. City pinned Bournemouth back but when Foden slid the ball left Mendy\u2019s cross skewed off his boot and into the seats behind Travers\u2019 goal. This defence was as shaky as the first-choice one: a long ball was hit over the top and Surridge was again free to canter at Steffen, Taylor Harwood-Bellis and Garc\u00eda recovering to stifle the centre-forward and the danger. Guardiola\u2019s use of two holding players in Doyle and Rodri instead of the usual one meant City could be too static. This was part of what prompted the manager to remove the latter for De Bruyne on the hour, his side now having only Doyle as a deep-lying midfielder. The Belgian\u2019s first contribution was a shoulder dip that drew a foul, but nothing came from the corner that followed De Bruyne\u2019s own free-kick. Guardiola\u2019s next decision was to replace Doyle with Raheem Sterling so the manager had gone from two players in front of his defence to none. After another De Bruyne free-kick came to nothing and Torres floated in a cross Bournemouth dealt with easily, City \u2013 at last \u2013 found penetration, and the winner. Mahrez and Foden combined, the former smacking the ball off Travers\u2019s left post before the latter hit home. Guardiola punched the air and City\u2019s winning sequence was 16 ties. Jason Tindall was left disappointed yet proud. \u201cThey did themselves justice,\u201d said Bournemouth\u2019s manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
