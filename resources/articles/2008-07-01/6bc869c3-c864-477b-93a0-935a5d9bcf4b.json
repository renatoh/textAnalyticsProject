It's that time of the year again - it's the MediaGuardian 100. Now in its eighth year since its debut in 2001, the MediaGuardian 100 measures cultural, economic and political influence among the UK's media movers and shakers. You can find out exactly where you - or your boss - came by clicking here for full details of the MediaGuardian 100, while here is a who's who of our panellists and an overview of their thoughts. For those of you who didn't make it this time round, but would quite like to next time, might I suggest you change your name to Andrew, with six Andrews (or Andys) in this year's MediaGuardian 100. There might have been seven had BBC Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt made it this time round. But he failed to make the cut, one of a number of high profile casualties from last year's list, including Richard Branson, Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, David Mannion, Simon Kelner, and Russell Brand. Now it's over to you. What do you think of the list? Who have we missed off it? And who would be in your own UK media power top 10?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
