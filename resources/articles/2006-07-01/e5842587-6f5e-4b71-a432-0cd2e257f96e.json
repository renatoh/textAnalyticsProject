The technology is seductively quirky: a little team of tiny ink guys rides in a cart across the moving sheet, spitting a cappella as they go. This is almost as crazy as the internal combustion engine, which is basically an exploding chorus line in a box. But at least cars usually manage more than a scant year's hoofing. Inkjet printers feature just two types of replaceable component: the ink tank and the print head. Ink tanks are pretty expensive for what they are. Hewlett Packard is kept afloat on a tide of branded ink that costs consumers, drop per drop, much more than petrol. It's the shaving companies' business model: give the handle away, charge plenty for the blades. You can save money with generic ink tanks, which work OK. You can also buy a tank refilling kit, comprising a syringe, bottle of ink and prayer sheet. Other tightwads use the power of gravity to drip ink into empty tanks. But these money-saving tactics are irrelevant in the face of the ultimate inkjet failure: the dead nozzle. Your printer's nifty routine for unclogging blocked nozzles will work a treat until the day after your warranty expires. Ignore your fellow owners grappling with the same problem in online forums. Their tales of derring-do with cotton buds and rubbing alcohol are all lies. Now's the time to lob the printer out of the window and swear never to buy another one. Don't be tempted to fork out on replacing the print head just because it's replaceable. You have reached the end of the line. Having just junked my fourth inkjet printer in as many years, I took a long, cool look at my printing needs. The only things I really print these days are screenplays. Now \"the industry\", as we movie outsiders call it, demands that every script is formatted to look like it came from a 1930s typewriter. You have to use 12 point Courier on 10 pitch, no bold or italic. Hollywood even frowns on the long dash, preferring a couple of prehistoric hyphens -- like that. So I'm now the slightly defensive owner of a \"pre-used\" daisywheel printer - it cost a staggering 99p on eBay. The technology at the heart of this beast is ridiculously simple. Each character in the font is arranged on a petal of a plastic flower about the size of your hand. The machine spins the disc and bangs the letters against a ribbon. It sounds like a barrel load of monkeys having an argument with a nail gun. But ... it works. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
