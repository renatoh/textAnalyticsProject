Heather O\u2019Neill\u2019s novel is harrowing, but Patricia Rodriguez\u2019s portrayal of a 12-year-old\u2019s extraordinarily adult attitude to both her father, who calls heroin \u201cchocolate milk\u201d, and her dysfunctional childhood is sympathetic and compelling. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 October 2016 to clarify that Lullabies for Little Criminals was written by Heather O\u2019Neill and read by Patricia Rodriguez"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
