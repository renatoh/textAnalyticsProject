The Russian state-dominated companies Rosneft and Gazprom were circling last night, confirming their interest in a business expected to go for a knockdown price at auction. Rosneft and Gazprom are cash-rich, with the former having just raised $10.4bn (\u00a35.7bn) through a flotation on the London stock market and Gazprom reporting a doubling in first-half profits to 177.06bn roubles (\u00a33.5bn) yesterday. Moscow's arbitration court upheld a vote by creditors to liquidate Yukos, which was once headed by the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, now serving eight years in a Siberian prison on politically tinged charges of fraud and tax evasion. Drew Holliner, a Yukos lawyer, called the ruling \"a death sentence\" for the firm. Before his arrest in 2003, Khodorkovsky clashed with President Vladimir Putin over energy policy and provoked the leader's ire by channelling funds to opposition parties. Yukos won plaudits from the west for good corporate governance but came under increasing scrutiny from the Kremlin and was presented with a series of multibillion-pound tax demands. Before yesterday's hearing the company had argued it could restructure itself and pay off its debts without going into receivership but creditors rejected a rescue plan last week after a court-appointed administrator warned them that the company was insolvent. Yukos's chief executive, Steven Theede, resigned last month, calling the bankruptcy proceedings a \"farce\". Yukos's debts were estimated at $18.3bn, while its assets stood at $17.7bn. Judge Pavel Markov ordered Yukos - once Russia's biggest oil company - to be broken up and auctioned to satisfy creditors, chiefly the tax authorities and Rosneft, which acquired $480m of Yukos's debt from western banks in April. Artyom Konchin, an oil and gas analyst at the Aton brokerage in Moscow, predicted Yukos's assets would be valued well below market rates and sold to \"state-owned or quasi state-owned companies\". Rosneft and the gas monopoly Gazprom are heavily tipped as the buyers. \"Those companies will have a very close relation to the whole process,\" said Konstantin Batunin, an analyst at Alfa Bank, reflecting concerns that the auctions will not be transparent. Rosneft and Gazprom's division of Yukos would be a huge boost to Mr Putin's crusade to strengthen the state by gathering hydrocarbon producers under state control. A university thesis written by Mr Putin in St Petersburg in the 1990s argued that Russia's revival as a world power relied on seizing oil and gas reserves. Mr Konchin said: \"The Kremlin wants to reduce the influence of politically independent or profit-oriented entities.\" Rosneft's daily production leapt from 1m barrels of oil to 1.6m after it swallowed Yuganskneftegas, Yukos's main production unit. Now it is being groomed to rival the likes of Exxon Mobil. Gazprom has flexed its muscles by expanding in Britain and said it would like to buy a large utility here. But its decision to cut off gas to Ukraine in January was seen by many as a political move inspired by Mr Putin. Yukos said it would appeal against yesterday's bankruptcy ruling. Gazprom has already offered to pay nearly $2bn for the 20% stake that Yukos owns in Gazprom Neft, formerly known as Sibneft."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
