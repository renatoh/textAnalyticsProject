England go into the European Championship with a number of attacking options available to Hodgson, with Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy and Dele Alli all having enjoyed excellent domestic seasons. The England coach named his squad for the upcoming friendlies against Germany in Berlin on Saturday and at Wembley against Holland the following Tuesday, with Leicester\u2019s Danny Drinkwater joining his club-mate Vardy among the 24. Hodgson selected Danny Rose and Ryan Bertrand ahead of the proven left-backs Leighton Baines and Kieran Gibbs, but reiterated his intent to give Manchester United\u2019s Luke Shaw the opportunity to make the cut for Euro 2016 if he returns from injury before the end of the season. While Kane and Alli have excelled for Tottenham and Vardy has enjoyed a sublime season for Leicester, Hodgson warned that most of his attackers had little experience at the highest level. He said: \u201cA lot of our players, when you take Wayne Rooney out of the equation, are still very inexperienced at international level. Lots don\u2019t have double figures in caps. We need to be a bit careful before we say that Jamie Vardy, Harry Kane or Dele Alli are going to win us the Euros. You\u2019re putting pressure on their shoulders that their CVs don\u2019t bear. \u201cThe hype and expectation 20 years ago was slightly different \u2013 the world was different \u2013 but the pressures have always been there. We can use [the psychiatrist] Steve Peters to have a word with players and try to give them the right sense of perspective and the right feelings about things. \u201cEveryone\u2019s different. That\u2019s the beauty of football, you\u2019re not dealing with robots. You\u2019re dealing with human beings, they have their good days and bad days, their happy moments and their sad moments, and they live in the world that we live in, and that is a world of mass media scrutiny, of Twitter and Facebook, and phone-ins. All we can do as coaches is use what abilities we have and what experience we have to try and help players through it. \u201cIt boils down to three things; mental strength is an important factor, focus is an important factor, and wellbeing \u2013 the way you approach your life, the balance you have in your life \u2013 is an important factor.\u201d Gary Neville will be returning to the England staff for the first time since becoming Valencia manager and Hodgson revealed he is looking forward to being reunited with Drinkwater, who Neville assisted in contract negotiations during the early stages of the midfielder\u2019s career at Manchester United. He said: \u201cI think Gary helped him with his contract negotiations when Danny was obviously quite a young lad, I think he\u2019s interested to see how he\u2019s developed as a person and meet him at a latter stage of his career rather than the young hopeful he was at Manchester United. He\u2019s watched the games like we have and he\u2019s see how Danny\u2019s been playing, he believes like Ray [Lewington, the assistant manager] and I that the lad deserves his selection.\u201d Regarding Shaw\u2019s possible return from a broken leg, Hodgson hopes United will give the defender a chance to prove himself before the end of the season although he indicated he would sympathise if they were to hold the player back. \u201cI would understand it, I would be a little bit disappointed in that I think the player deserves the opportunity if he is fully fit to be given a chance of being selected,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he has to play one game, two games, three games. I shall judge it and if he is fully fit I will make a decision on it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
