It's Sunday and the streets are deserted. Everyone is safely behind doors, eating lunch or taking a nap. Apart from us that is, four English people, not quite sure what to do or where to go, looking for anything that is open. We stop at a cafe with some chairs under the shade of the arcade, and order panini and coffee. There's one man inside, watching TV. We were ready for lunch, but the real reason for our stop was to ask for directions. 'Dov'\u00e8 Prada?' I ask, in my basic taxi-driver Italian. You might think asking a cafe owner in a sleepy backwater for directions to the nearest Prada store would be like asking for Manolo Blahnik in the highlands of Scotland. But this is Montevarchi, home of the Prada factory. Everyone knows where it is. You head out of town, and turn left at the semaforo lampeggiato (those flashing traffic lights that do nothing apart from tell you there might be another car hurtling across your path, so slow down). I don't know my sinistra from my destra , so we get lost and have to ask again. This time, it's a couple of blokes enjoying a Sunday beer at a roadside cafe. It's 2.30 by the time we find it - an anonymous- looking concrete warehouse in a small industrial park. It's just reopened after lunch and suddenly it's like Milan central: the car park filled with flashy Mercedes and BMWs. These people don't look like Montevarchi locals: they are wearing black, with wrap-around sunglasses, expensive-looking shoes and bags. And that's just the men. A small crowd has gathered so we join them. There's a ticket machine, like the one at the Sainsbury's deli counter, so you have to wait for your number to be displayed on the board above the door, which is guarded by security guards who look like police. This place is run with military precision. We arrived in Tuscany the night before, flying in to Pisa and then driving two and a half hours via Florence to the Villa Rosmarino, a recently renovated apartment within an old farmhouse. The nearest town, Cortona, was twinkling in the distance. There were five apartments in total, each sleeping from two to eight people, but we were the only guests at the time and had the whole place to ourselves - including the swimming pool and barbecue area. Most people go to Tuscany in search of art, culture, reli gion, olive groves and rustic wine, but we were on a different mission altogether. Forget the Uffizi. Who cares about the Duomo? We were here - boyfriend Mark, and parents Arlene and Tony - to worship at cathedrals of a different kind. Tuscany is the home to the Italian textile industry. And where there are factories, there are factory outlets. The fashion houses which manufacture in Tuscany include Gucci, Fendi, Armani, Dolce e Gabbana, Jil Sander, Helmut Lang and Prada. Call us Philistines, but most Italians would agree with us that alta moda is up there with fast cars, parmigiano and Michelangelo. Certainly, those who had turned up for the Prada Sunday service would agree. By the time our number was called, Arlene and I were overexcited. Even my boyfriend and father were interested. Shoppers were leaving with huge white carrier bags full of booty. Once inside, it was every man for himself. I headed straight for the shoes. And there were plenty of them. Two whole sections, crammed full of brightly coloured heels, strappy sandals, moulded trainers and winter boots. This is heaven for a label queen who likes to pick up a bargain or two, but if you are the sort of fashion victim who only wants the latest thing, these factory shops are not for you. They are more like a supermarket than a fashion boutique, with the seasons mixed up and a pile 'em high and sell 'em cheap(ish) attitude. Prada owns Jil Sander, Helmut Lang and Church's shoes, so they are all on sale at the factory outlet, but while prices are discounted by up to 60 per cent, this doesn't necessarily mean you'll be able to afford them. Feeling a little dazed, I went to see what the others were doing. Arlene thought it was still quite expensive but was examining a huge canvas and leather bowling bag; Tony was lusting after a pair of Prada boots for about \u20ac80 (\u00a353) but they didn't have his size. Mark was clutching a navy silk Helmut Lang suit. It was a bargain, but at \u00a3350 he wasn't sure. And then I saw it: a soft, unstructured jacket by Prada in a blue and cream print. I tried it on and - as is often the way with well-made, well-cut clothes - I didn't want to take it off. Ever. It was 40 per cent off the reduced price. I didn't even stop to convert the \u20ac250 to sterling. I was buying it. Then I realised that everything in the store had an extra 40 per cent off. Mark's Lang suit joined my jacket in the queue for the till. The parents left empty-handed, but we walked out proudly carrying the big white bag, just like the other shoppers before us. Factory outlets are sprinkled around the hills of Tuscany. It's possible to combine them with a few churches and museums. From Montevarchi, it's not too far to Siena. We got there just in time for afternoon tea and a gelato. Or if shopping and sightseeing sounds too exhausting, you can simply return home to a bottle of the local Casale Poggio Alto wine and a gentle doze by the pool. The Thursday market at Camucia, on the way to Cortona, is perfect for picking up some artichokes or porcini mushrooms for a DIY Tuscan supper. But if you are a serious shopper, you will need a whole day to visit the cluster of outlets just south east of Florence, near to Incisa. It was about an hour's drive from our villa, up the autostrada , dodging the crazy Italians who fly out of nowhere, at 150km per hour, to sit on your rear bumper until you move out of the way. But with the prospect of the Gucci Mall up ahead, who could blame them? Unlike Prada's anonymous utility approach, Gucci's outlet store is like a proper boutique, with its own boardwalk leading up to a terrace of shops, featuring its own brands, including Yves Saint Laurent,shoe designer Sergio Rossi and luxury leather goods house Bottega Veneta. There's also a Giorgio Armani shop tagged on to the end. The Gucci shop is fitted out like any other, with bamboo-handled bags, signature accessories, clothes and shoes, for both men and women. It doesn't look like a remainder store, there's no queuing and it is by no means jumble-sale prices. But if you've wanted that Gucci corset dress ever since you saw it on Kate Moss and have a spare \u00a3650, now's your chance. Arlene couldn't be swayed, but managed to find herself the bargain of the week at the Armani store, a fantastic printed chiffon blouse for just \u00a318.50. Tony was tempted by an Armani suit but still couldn't get quite excited enough and wandered off to find refreshments at the cafe. For shoe fetishists, Sergio Rossi is a paradise: all of last season's collection for around half price. The Gucci Mall forms a triangle with Dolce e Gabbana along the road and Fendi, a few minutes' drive further on. The D&amp;G shop is built alongside the factory, a nondescript chunk on the landscape. Once inside, however (again, no queue), it's a really pleasant shopping experience. As with all these outlets, you don't get followed around by a pushy shop assistant with an eye on her commission. For a pinstripe trouser suit, like the one Victoria Beckham wore to the Dolce e Gabbana Milan show last year, you could expect to pay around \u00a3265. In fact, Posh and Becks would have a field day in here. But it was at Fendi that I found handbag heaven. People join waiting lists for a Fendi bag, and although the really popular styles will never find their way to the factory shop floor, there are plenty of classics that do. There are shelves of them. I found myself clutching a monogrammed tan leather handbag that was probably unchanged in design since the Seventies. It was only \u00a380 - pin money to a Fendi diehard. Then I found myself wondering if it hadn't all got to me, this designer bargain hunting. I am not a Fendi handbag kind of girl. So I pulled myself together and left empty-shouldered. But I've been thinking about it ever since - and it's as good an excuse as any to book a cheap flight now to make a return trip.
