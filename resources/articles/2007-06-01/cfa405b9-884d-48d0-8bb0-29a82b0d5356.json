It can most recently be traced to 1979 and Margaret Thatcher's government. Her mission was to make complicated things simple. What could be more straightforward: define education as meeting targets, design a 'national' curriculum around outcomes and then test every five minutes to show you're achieving them. As a headteacher for 27 years, I believe such remorseless testing has nothing to do with education, which has as much to do with drawing out as putting in. It doesn't tell a thinking teacher any more than he or she knows already through assessment. It doesn't do anything for children except confirm them as educational successes or failures. It does nothing for parents except increase anxiety and/or cynicism. It doesn't do anything for schools except to take up valuable time and narrow and focus teaching towards the tests. Of course, the sloppy thinking that informs the testing disease began before Mrs Thatcher. To adapt a quote from Oscar Wilde, it is driven by people who know 'the price of everything and the value of nothing'. Graham Jameson London SE14 By exposing students to regular exams we force those who are academically and extra-curricularly gifted to choose which they must specialise in - or risk over-stretching themselves and underachieving in both. The risk of not fulfilling in exams is too high, and many just let their extra-curricular abilities slide. The 'exam period' doesn't just consist of the month or so of actual exams. The stress, anxiety, and compulsive revision begin up to two months beforehand. Everyone (particularly, in my experience, those aiming for the highest grades) puts all other activities on hold. I dread to think how many gifted young sports people, actors, musicians and the like have been held back by the need to put everything on hold for exams. Oliver Marsh GCSE Student Knutsford, Cheshire We need to question the value of 'learning to the test or the exam'. In his essay on 'schoolmasters' learning' published in 1580, Michel de Montaigne said 'their pupils... are not nourished and fed by what they learn; the learning is passed from hand to hand with only one end in view: to show it off, to put into accounts as though it were merely counters, useful for totting up and producing statements, but having no other use or currency'. Professor Colin Richards Spark Bridge, Cumbria As a teacher and a parent, I oppose removing the key stage 2 exams, which did not disturb either of my older children. Indeed, it gave them a chance to demonstrate their abilities without the risk of favouritism. Karen Revans Bridgwater, Somerset As a former teacher, I wonder if the 'culture of testing' that makes English students the world's most tested is responsible not only for the stress felt by students, but also for the alienation felt by those condemned to 'fail' tests that concentrate solely on 'core' subjects. David Powicke Minster on Sea, Kent The real problem is that teachers and children share an educational environment in school until the bell rings, when the counterculture sets in. The repetitive music, TV programmes, computer games, fashions, sex mags, iPods... All this technology blasts the brains of the young so that school lessons seem dull and futile. The young, like all of us, deserve their fun. But not when it floods out all before it, alienating, devaluing, leaving nothing for the full life that follows - unless you wish to be a Rolling Stone at 65.
