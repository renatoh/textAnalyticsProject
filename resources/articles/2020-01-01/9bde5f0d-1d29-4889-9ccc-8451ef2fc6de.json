Chelsea have been frustrated in their search for attacking reinforcements this month and Lampard, who is not opposed to a short-term deal for an experienced forward in the right circumstances, suggested that adjusting to the pace of the Premier League would not be beyond Cavani. The striker has been limited to 14 appearances for PSG this season and has informed the French champions of his desire to join Atl\u00e9tico, who have offered the 32-year-old an 18-month deal worth \u20ac10m (\u00a38.5m) a year. Atl\u00e9tico are confident of signing Cavani and while handing the Uruguay forward such a big contract could force Diego Simeone\u2019s side to seek a buyer for Diego Costa, Chelsea would have to move quickly to land a player who has scored 198 goals since joining PSG in 2013. The former Napoli striker has also been offered to Tottenham, who are without the hamstrung Harry Kane until mid-April, and he could be of interest to Manchester United, who will be without Marcus Rashford for at least two months after the England forward suffered a double stress fracture in his back. Lampard made it clear he wants to improve his side\u2019s attack following the blunt 1-0 defeat by Newcastle on Saturday. Chelsea have lost eight league games this season and, although they remain five points above fifth-placed Manchester United before hosting Arsenal this evening, a lack of ruthlessness is hurting their bid for Champions League qualification. The challenge for Lampard is finding value for money in a quiet market. Chelsea are struggling to secure their main targets this month \u2013 moves for Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho and Red Bull Leipzig\u2019s Timo Werner will have to wait until the summer, Lyon are determined not to sell Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Crystal Palace\u2019s \u00a380m valuation of Wilfried Zaha is putting off potential suitors \u2013 and Cavani could provide quality competition for Tammy Abraham. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI played against him and I always loved his mentality. Obviously his goalscoring record speaks for itself. I\u2019m not absolutely aware of what the situation is, so we\u2019ll see. I think we are young and we know about the transitions. The idea of bringing in experience is something I\u2019m not absolutely looking away from. Sometimes the young players need a little bit of help.\u201d There would be a risk attached to signing Cavani, who has fallen down the pecking order at PSG since the arrival of Mauro Icardi from Internazionale. He is not the force of old, injuries lowering his explosiveness, and Chelsea have seen gambles on fading big-name forwards like Radamel Falcao, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn and Alexandre Pato backfire in the past. Yet while those three are cautionary tales, they will not enter Lampard\u2019s thinking when it comes to Cavani. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cEach case is different and whether it\u2019s worked or not in certain cases I wouldn\u2019t let that cloud my thinking. \u201cI would do it here in a moment if I felt there was experience needed and the player comes up and they\u2019re gettable, then I wouldn\u2019t say: \u2018Oh, that hasn\u2019t worked a few times with different players.\u2019 Everyone is different. If it felt right, then it\u2019s something we would look at doing.\u201d Inter, managed by Antonio Conte, are set to sign Victor Moses on loan with an option to make the deal permanent for \u20ac10m. Moses, who has spent the last 18 months on loan at Fenerbahce, impressed as a right wing-back when Chelsea won the title under Conte in 2017. Meanwhile Eddie Newton, a member of Lampard\u2019s backroom staff, is set to move to Turkey after holding positive talks with Trabzonspor about becoming their assistant manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
