Then, last out, wearing a jacket in 90F (32C) heat, wandered an overweight 52-year-old, Vicente del Bosque. Del Bosque smiled through his heroic moustache, but if what he thinks is going to happen does happen, he will have just overseen one of his last training sessions as Real Madrid's manager. Last Friday, when asked about the then theoretical signing of David Beckham, he was less than effervescent in his reply. \"I get the feeling I am not going to be here anyway,\" he said. It was, he stressed, just a feeling, but Real Madrid operates on such feelings. Since succeeding John Toshack as manager four seasons ago, Del Bosque has been in charge of a team who have won the European Cup twice and are on the verge of clinching a second Liga title. They have also lost two European Cup semi-finals, to Bayern Munich in 2000 and to Juventus this April. Del Bosque could hardly be considered a failure. Yet all along he has been seen as a symbolic figure rather than the hands-on decision-maker. This is perceived as criticism but plumping for amiability was a conscious move by Madrid after Toshack's comparative antagonism. Del Bosque handles the superstars by allowing latitude. \"Some managers say 'No one gives me orders',\" Del Bosque said recently when outlining his managerial style. \"Nonsense. This is a business, I am the coach, an employee. I do not dominate everything.\" In the dressing room it is Fernando Hierro and Raul, the capitanes , who run Madrid. In the boardroom it is the president Florentino Perez and the sporting director Jorge Valdano who count. This will be a new world to Beckham. At Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson dominates all. Nothing goes on at the club that he does not know about and the team is a mirror of his personality. Beckham, a char acter of comparable motivation, has benefited from this. But he has also felt the down side when Ferguson has felt his dedication was waning. He will have to acclimatise to a different environment in Madrid. Valdano has already placed great emphasis on learning the language but it is also about learning a new code of behaviour in which the players have considerably greater professional and personal freedom. However, Del Bosque may not be around to supervise Beckham's integration. Con tractual discussions about a new deal were postponed after Del Bosque, for the first time in his three decades-plus at the Bernabeu as player and coach, hired an agent. It is understood there is still no new offer and if Real were to finish the season trophyless then there almost certainly would not be one forthcoming. However, their 4-0 destruction of neighbours Atletico last Sunday night lifted Real above Real Sociedad into Liga leadership with only this Sunday's fixture, at home to Athletic Bilbao, remaining. Win it and it would look strange if the manager were then released. But there is that possibility. On Monday Real Madrid's board gathers and Valdano said Del Bosque's future would be revealed then. If that means the end of Del Bosque then there is debate about the nature of his successor. A man such as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger - believed to have turned the job down recently - would want the sort of control and authority that has been erased in Del Bosque's time. For three summers and more Del Bosque has wanted a new centre-half. Madrid have bought Zidane, Ronaldo and now Beckham. Wenger would not countenance that policy. Under Perez the manager has become an adjunct of the president's office and victory over Bilbao might mean the postponement of a hard choice for Perez. Del Bosque would ensure continuity for another season while the search for a new man continued. To an extent, a high-profile recruit would mean a change of culture from the current regime. When he talked about the culture of Real Madrid yesterday Valdano spoke of Beckham, not of Del Bosque, but the managerial succession is relevant. The media circus accom-panying Beckham would not be \"a source of contamination\" to the club. \"Proportion\" is the secret to handling so many big names, Valdano said. \"And the proportions here are not going to change. Beckham will take a squad number like everyone else, a salary like everyone else. It is about normality and it's not about imposing aggravating comparisons between the players. The superstars are always intelligent players.\" At Real Madrid normality is superstardom according to Valdano. Vicente del Bosque might not agree."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
