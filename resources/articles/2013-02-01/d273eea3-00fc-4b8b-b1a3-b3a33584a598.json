Alois Dvorzac was said to be \"extremely distressed\" before being rushed to hospital on 10 February. He died later that day in hospital after suffering a suspected heart attack. The United Kingdom Borders Agency refused to confirm or deny the death and would not say why Dvorzac was in detention. The Canadian high commission in London said they were aware of reports of a Canadian who was detained in London and had since died. A spokeswoman said the high commissioner in London was in contact with the local authorities. She added: \"Due to the Privacy Act, no additional information can be released at this time.\" It was a \"sad case\", she said. A spokesman for the Metropolitan police confirmed the death and said it was not being treated as suspicious. A postmortem took place on 13 February. Seven people have died at Harmondsworth since it reopened as the first purpose-built immigration detention centre in 2001. The centre is managed by the private company GEO on behalf of UKBA. It is the largest immigration detention centre in Europe. In all, 17 people have died in the UK detention estate. The Guardian has spoken to another detainee at Harmondsworth, who did not want to be named. He said Dvorzac was \"extremely distressed\" on the day in question and that he had complained of chest pains. \u2022 The Guardian would like to speak to anyone with more information on the life or death of Alois Dvorzac.
