The owners of Winterbourne View, near Bristol, where 13 members of staff have been suspended after an investigation by the BBC's Panorama, have \"voluntarily relinquished the hospital registration\". In a short statement, the County Durham-based firm Castlebeck said: \"The hospital will effectively close this Friday when the last patients are transferred to alternative services. \"Castlebeck has been working closely with families and carers, commissioners and other professionals from the NHS and social services to ensure patients are safely transferred with minimum disruption to their lives.\" Avon and Somerset police have arrested and bailed eight men and three women in connection with the case. Last month Panorama broadcast undercover footage of apparent misconduct at the hospital in Hambrook, South Gloucestershire, which appeared to show vulnerable residents being pinned down, slapped, doused in water and taunted. South Gloucestershire council has launched a serious case review into practices at Winterbourne View. The government has said a full independent inquiry into what happened at the hospital had not been ruled out. Jack Lopresti, the area's Conservative MP, told the BBC he had met Lee Reed, the chief executive of Castlebeck, over the scandal. \"Mr Reed gave me his assurances that the closure of the hospital will be conducted in as sensitive a way as possible,\" he said. \"I stand by my call for the hospital's closure and I am pleased that Castlebeck have come to the same conclusion. \"Given the horrific events which have taken place at Winterbourne View I believe its future running is untenable,\" said Lopresti, MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke. On its website Castlebeck describes Winterbourne View as \"a purpose designed acute service, offering assessment and intervention and support for people with learning disabilities, complex needs and challenging behaviour\". It has previously apologised for the abuse that appears to have taken place. \"We are deeply distressed by the completely unacceptable and appalling behaviour of a small number of our employees at one of our facilities,\" it said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
