The source of her ire was the latest trend piece comparing yet another part of the world \u2013 this time Los Angeles \u2013 to Brooklyn. Her complaint, like that of so many who call Brooklyn home, is more than fair: the world\u2019s idea of the entire borough of Brooklyn, which is bigger than most cities, is based on the neighborhood of Williamsburg. And the New York Times, with its ceaseless churn of \u201cnew Brooklyn\u201d stories, is more than partly to blame. (Well, the New York Times and Girls.) \u201c[L]ike the new black, the new-Brooklyn meme is curiously durable,\u201d WM Ferguson declared in a 2009 New York Times article. The paper\u2019s style section has been putting that claim to the test ever since, reliably producing a new article comparing Brooklyn to other cities \u2013 Beijing, Oakland, you name it \u2013 every few months. Its writers have been observing Brooklynites and their migration patterns, tracking hipsters as they flee to places like the Hudson Valley, or Philadelphia, or \u2013 what the hell \u2013 even and especially Berlin. The Times\u2019 new-Brooklyn mania has been catalogued by the Atlantic, which declared that \u201cit seems just about anywhere is a bit like New York\u2019s hippest borough\u201d. The latest offering from the anywhere-is-Brooklyn series is this week\u2019s story by Alex Williams, claiming that Los Angeles is \u201cthe grown-up version of Williamsburg\u201d. In search of sunshine and space, New Yorkers have apparently been making their way to the west coast and, especially, Los Angeles. Williams does manage to admit that \u201cthe census bureau does not specifically track the migration patterns of Bushwick neo-expressionists and digital brand strategists\u201d. That is only partly true, as the census does track people moving from one county to another. The data is dense, but a team at Trulia, a real estate marketplace, sifted through it last year when the latest data was released and found that yes, New Yorkers were moving to Los Angeles. From 2008 to 2012, they estimate about 8,467 people made the move. Turns out, though, that New Yorkers were also moving to Atlanta (7,278) and to Miami (5,564). Does that mean that Atlanta and Miami are the new Brooklyn too? The moves weren\u2019t all one-sided, either, with 5,451 Angelenos moving to New York. Those few thousand transplants are nothing compared to the number of people who are not moving anywhere at all. New York City \u2013 which consists of five boroughs/counties \u2013 has a population of 8.45 million. Brooklyn alone is home to about 2.5 million people. The city of Los Angeles has a population of 3.95 million. The county of Los Angeles has a population of 10.1 million. Having a handful of acquaintances who have made the switch between New York and LA, I figured I\u2019d just ask them about how the two areas compare. The problem is that \u2013 unlike the New York Times \u2013 my friends insisted they were not comfortable making any sweeping generalizations about either city, or its residents, and none would go on the record to express their opinion. That is, except for Larry. \u201cNot sure I\u2019m qualified to comment on this,\u201d Larry told me over Facebook messenger. Larry and I met in 2006 when we both worked at the same bar in Manhattan\u2019s East Village. From 2008 to 2009, Larry lived in Brooklyn, but has since moved to Los Angeles. So: is Los Angeles the new Brooklyn? \u201cStraight up \u2018no\u2019\u201d, Larry said, even if there are some similarities. \u201cGentrification is definitely a phenomenon that exists is both places,\u201d he told me. \u201cSimilar to Brooklyn, [Venice Beach and Santa Monica] were once very hospitable to artists/wayward souls/homeless folks looking to find the dream. And very much like Brooklyn, those sort of people are being priced out.\u201d To prove his point, Larry singled out Skid Row, a neighborhood in downtown Los Angeles where the homeless account for about 10% of the population. \u201cWhat used to be homeless areas are being plowed over, making way for displaced Brooklynites,\u201d Larry said, adding that, rent-wise, most of Los Angeles is cheaper than Brooklyn. Gentrification has affected areas like Skid Row in Los Angeles and Williamsburg in Brooklyn. However, the two cities have seen more of their neighborhoods plunge into poverty. The people in these neighborhoods can\u2019t just pick up and move; moving takes time and money, which are in short supply in such neighborhoods. Consider this: in 2010, an area in California consisting of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Santa Ana had a high poverty population of 309,683. That\u2019s up from 84,119 in 1970, according to City Observatory. During the intervening 40 years, in that exact area, the number of high poverty tracts \u2013 neighborhood zones of about 4,000 people as determined by the US census \u2013 went from 76 to 210. Same goes for New York. The high poverty population for New York, northern New Jersey and Long Island reached 632,754 in 2010, up from 404,587. The number of high poverty tracts went from 198 to 387. Instead of being gentrified by hipsters, many of the neighborhoods in the two metro areas are falling further into poverty. Trend pieces, though, prefer to look at the world simply. They prefer not to mention the poverty that has made places like New York and Los Angeles prime examples of inequality, where the rich live alongside the poor. The New York Times prefers to see its city as a hipster paradise: Bearded young New Yorkers can snap up brioche tarts at Proof Bakery in Atwater Village, visit gallery shows at Shepard Fairey\u2019s Subliminal Projects in Echo Park, or settle in over barrel-aged rye cocktails at Bar Stella in Silver Lake, and scarcely realize they are more than a stroll away from McCarren Park, except for the 70-degree sunshine tickling their cheeks in February. The \u201cpaper of record\u201d may have just discovered the hip neighborhoods of Los Angeles for itself, but those who are actually from there will be quick to tell you that\u2019s nothing new. \u201cThere\u2019s been hipsterville in Los Angeles before,\u201d a coworker said to me, glancing up from the article. \u201cBrooklyn doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on hipsters.\u201d An LA-to-New York transplant, she is not unfamiliar with the (also not-new) trend of people trading one city for another. A Brooklyn couple took over her apartment when she moved to New York, but that doesn\u2019t mean that Los Angeles is the new Brooklyn. At all. \u201cLos Angeles is its own thing,\u201d Larry told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not Brooklyn. It\u2019s a different animal. In some ways it\u2019s similar in spirit, yet entirely different in form and function. Structurally, it\u2019s too different to even take the mantle of \u2018ole Brooklyn\u2019. Nor would it want to.
