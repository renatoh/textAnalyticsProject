De Gea was United\u2019s hero, making 11 saves \u2013 the most he has made in a top-flight league game \u2013 with some of them taking the breath and the wind from Spurs\u2019 sails. Solskj\u00e6r has won all six of his matches since he stepped in for the sacked Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. It was an afternoon of misfortune for Mauricio Pochettino, the Spurs manager, who has been heavily linked with a move to United at the end of the season, when Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s short-term contract is due to expire. Harry Kane suffered a twisted ankle after a tackle from Phil Jones in what was the last action of the game while Moussa Sissoko had earlier left with a groin problem. The severity of Kane\u2019s injury is unclear at present but the timing is far from ideal, with Son Heung-min now departing for the Asia Cup. For United Paul Pogba continued his swashbuckling form \u2013 he set up the 44th-minute winner for Marcus Rashford with a beautifully weighted pass \u2013 and, although they came to rely on De Gea, there was further evidence of a return to their traditions of fast, attacking football, particularly in the first half. De Gea said: \u201cThe manager brought some happiness, the players are playing well and the team is very strong now. This is the real Manchester United. We won the game against a top team, we controlled the first half but in the second half they had chances. I don\u2019t even remember some of the saves so I can\u2019t pick a best.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r has described De Gea on more than one occasion as the best goalkeeper in the world and he added a twist to hyperbole here. \u201cThere have been some great keepers at this club and he is challenging Edwin [van der Sar] and Peter [Schmeichel] for the No 1 spot historically. There were one or two fantastic ones and the rest were just about concentration. The team spirit is fantastic and, secondly, we\u2019ve shown we can defend today.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r and Pochettino both stressed that the question of the permanent managerial position at Old Trafford was not something they wanted to discuss. Pochettino was disappointed that a driving performance had yielded nothing \u2013 he said the second 45 minutes was the finest football of his four-and-a-half-year tenure at the club \u2013 and he was concerned about Kane, who has a history of ankle problems. \u201cMy worry is that it was a bad tackle in the last moment,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the intention of the United player but it was a bad tackle and now he has bit of a swelling on his ankle and he was limping after the game. We are going to lose Son for the Asia Cup and, if Harry suffers an injury, it is going to be massive for us.\u201d Pogba, who had fallen out with Mourinho, has been revitalised under Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cI am enjoying my football now,\u201d Pogba said. \u201cI like to be more attacking. I had to defend too much before and that is not my best attribute. This is my position. The manager tells me to get into the box and score goals. The best example is Frank Lampard.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
