I\u2019ll go to bed early. It\u2019s 10pm and I have a mound of work to motor through the next day. If I grab half an hour in front of Netflix, I\u2019ll still manage to wake up in time to get a head start \u2013 right? Wrong. One sitcom episode becomes, er, four \u2013 and it\u2019s nearly 1am when I eventually stumble to bed. By the time I make it to my desk (which is in my bedroom) the next morning, it\u2019s past 10; I\u2019ll end up working late that evening to compensate. Clearly, I\u2019m doomed to be a slovenly night owl for evermore. However, the latest research suggests our body clocks may be more malleable than previously thought. A study by the universities of Birmingham and Surrey and Monash University in Australia found that people going to bed in the early hours could shift their schedule forward by up to three hours in under a month. It looked at 22 young adults who were turning in at around 3am and getting up at about 10.30am. They were charged with adopting a routine that involved them sleeping and rising two to three hours earlier \u2013 along with engaging in \u201csleep hygiene\u201d techniques, such as ditching caffeine and skipping weekend lie-ins. Not only did everyone taking part manage to stick to the regimen, they also found it beneficial: anxiety levels, stress and depression all dropped significantly. The prevailing thinking around whether we\u2019re larks or night owls insists genes have a large part to play. Indeed, I always assumed my groggy breakfast-time persona could be blamed on my father, who lounges in bed like a teenager on his days off. But the Birmingham study suggests it\u2019s not purely down to DNA. \u201cThere is a big genetic component, but there\u2019s also flexibility \u2013 the system can respond to training,\u201d says the study\u2019s co-author, Andrew Bagshaw, a scientist at the university\u2019s Centre for Human Brain Health. Neil Stanley, the author of How To Sleep Well, agrees. \u201cWe shift our timing when we go on holiday, so it\u2019s obviously within our capabilities.\u201d This is a soothing lullaby to my ears; I\u2019ve grown sick of my late schedule. It\u2019s meant I\u2019ve spent my whole life feeling like I\u2019m running behind. As a teenager, I struggled to get out of bed in time for the school bus. I regularly snoozed through 9am university lectures and I was frequently tardy for my former job at a culture magazine. (Which, mortifyingly, didn\u2019t start until 10am.) When I became a freelance journalist in January, I thought I\u2019d finally escaped the guilt-inducing shackles of the 9 to 5. Then I realised that unless I got up in time to pitch stories to editors before early-morning features meetings, I\u2019d be penniless. Over the years I\u2019ve tried, and failed, to change \u2013 but deep down I\u2019ve always assumed I\u2019m destined for a life of pub nights rather than power breakfasts. Yet Bagshaw says my ideal 11pm to 7am night is within my reach. First, I need to make a consistent effort to go to bed promptly. (No more hoping time will miraculously expand to accommodate my Netflix dependency.)Sticking to regular breakfast and lunch times and getting as much natural light as possible in the morning will also help, he says. Meanwhile, Stanley recommends making gradual changes. \u201cMove bedtime half an hour earlier for a week or two, and then add another half an hour, and so on.\u201d He also makes the crucial distinction between going to bed and going to sleep. \u201cIt\u2019s lights out time, not bedtime, that you\u2019re modifying.\u201d But, hang on. Are larks inherently healthier? Or is it merely that early risers have an easier ride because they naturally suit standard working times? Bagshaw admits it\u2019s probably the latter. \u201cIf you\u2019re a late person and you\u2019re trying to fit into the 9 to 5 you\u2019re going to feel tired and you\u2019re not going to get sleep at the time that\u2019s good for you, nor the duration you need.\u201d Comedian and writer Stevie Martin, who has written about being a night owl for the website Refinery29, says it\u2019s the vilification of waking up late that leads to negative emotions, rather than the hours you keep. \u201cI felt so much happier when I stopped setting goals like \u2018get up before 9am every work day\u2019 and allowed myself the freedom to start whenever my brain switched on.\u201d So should I be rallying for systemic change rather than trying to fit my square peg of a body clock into a 9-to-5 hole? A bit of both, says Stanley. \u201cYou can modify your behaviour, but you can also modify your lifestyle. If you\u2019re a night owl, don\u2019t get a job as a milkman.\u201d Additionally, advice for aspiring early risers applies only if you work conventional hours. Henna Sinha, a junior doctor at Homerton University Hospital in east London, says her shift rota, which includes regular nights, means she has scant control over her sleep pattern. \u201cI just have to go into work when I\u2019m asked. It\u2019s all very well saying go to bed earlier, but that doesn\u2019t really work if your bedtime is 7am.\u201d Nevertheless, Bagshaw says the study\u2019s techniques aid sleep, whatever the schedule. As flexible working becomes increasingly common, hopefully the narrative that lauds early risers for being healthy and productive, while dismissing nocturnal types as lazy creatives, will melt away. But until then, it\u2019s heartening to know I can adapt during periods when I need to rise early. I won\u2019t chastise myself if it\u2019s tricky, though. As Stanley says: \u201cYou can\u2019t remake yourself. You can cope with new routines \u2013 but it will never be what you truly are.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
