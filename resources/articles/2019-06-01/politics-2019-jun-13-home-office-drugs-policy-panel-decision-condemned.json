The ACMD acts as an independent advisory board to the Home Office, whose proper functioning relies on the participation of the UK\u2019s leading experts. The Home Office\u2019s decision to screen candidates based on \u201crelevant social media content\u201d (and beyond to unrelated content including Brexit and Windrush) is a worrying act of political interference in an impartial and apolitical body. The UK is experiencing levels of avoidable drug-related deaths not seen for decades, constituting a third of all drug-related deaths in Europe. That Eastwood simultaneously supported the ACMD\u2019s findings on the need to implement drug consumption rooms and criticised the Home Office\u2019s inaction on this issue does not constitute \u201clobbying\u201d, or compromise her ability to provide unbiased advice to the government. Eastwood is one of the UK\u2019s leading voices on evidence-based drug policies and harm reduction. The ACMD\u2019s ability to provide the best available advice to the government, and the government\u2019s ability to support its most vulnerable citizens, is made weaker by her absence. We strongly condemn this decision and invite the Home Office to reconsider.
