Over four albums, the Glaswegians have carved out a niche as our foremost chroniclers of bedsit whimsy. Where other acts might employ a screeching guitar solo for impact, this sensitive outfit is more likely to opt for the gentle twirl of a flute. Frontman Stuart Murdoch's tiny, fragile voice has become synonymous with heartfelt elegies to wounded innocence. In the process, however, the group have earned themselves a reputation in some quarters as ineffectual, twee and infantile. Yet tonight's show proves that Belle and Sebastian carry far more weight than received wisdom suggests. By sweeping the crowd along on a wave of delicate, lilting melodies, Murdoch and his bandmates make a far greater impact than the histrionic wailings of many of their peers. It is true that the band's notoriety for shambolic live performances was initially deserved. Their early gigs were characterised by hesitant, unfocused performances that betrayed an almost pathological lack of confidence. Happily, the past six years seem to have sharpened Belle and Sebastian's sound considerably. Despite the unwieldy set-up - as many as 13 musicians are onstage at once - the group never seem overwhelmed. Indeed, new depths are revealed in familiar songs such as Fox in the Snow and Dylan in the Movies thanks to the subtle innovation of the brass and string sections. It is this lightness of touch that makes Belle and Sebastian so effective. A song such as Slow Graffiti sees Murdoch's fragile voice emote pure melancholy. Yet the band's restrained, downbeat manner means they never risk sounding over the top or contrived. And it's to their credit that this seriousness never undermines their sense of humour. Guitarist Stevie Jackson offers a deadly accurate impression of Elvis Costello singing The Sun Has Got His Hat On; not many groups would so readily disregard any pretence of studied cool. And a steady stream of banter between band and crowd, much of it related to drummer Richard Colburn's local roots, suggests that these supposed art-school dreamers have got more of the common touch than their critics imagine. Belle and Sebastian could hardly measure up less to the classic rock yardstick of danger, debauchery and excess. On the strength of tonight's performance, it seems we may have to rethink those criteria altogether. \u0095 Belle and Sebastian play Music Hall, Aberdeen (01224 632080) on June 14, then tour."}, "isHosted": false}}}
