City, in Germany for Wednesday\u2019s Champions League last-16 first leg against Schalke, won the Premier League last season with a record 100 points and also claimed the Carabao Cup. This season they are still in contention for a quadruple and, though De Bruyne described this as \u201cnearly impossible\u201d, he is unfazed by City having to adjust their play to beat teams. Asked to compare last season\u2019s side with the current one, De Bruyne said: \u201cI think it\u2019s the same. In the league we lost a few more but we are still fighting on all fronts. I think other teams figure out what we do a bit better. They have better squads, we just added one player [Riyad Mahrez].\u201d In the league City have 65 points and lead Liverpool on goal difference, though the Merseyside club have played a match fewer. De Bruyne said: \u201cThe way we play is always going to be the same with Pep [Guardiola] \u2013 we\u2019re not going to change. We\u2019ve a lot of points and are still setting a high standard, maybe not the same as last year but maybe we\u2019ll win more titles. If we win three titles, we will have done better than last year. \u201cTitles are the most important thing. We also do different things. We have main guidelines for what we always do but we try to adapt. We also know if teams do other things we must try something else as openings come in a different way, we try to adapt and dominate games. Sometimes in games that are more difficult we try to win in another way.\u201d The midfielder added: \u201cI think the goal is not to win the four competitions. The goal is to win every game and the further you progress, you want to win the next game. You cannot say at the beginning we are going to win four.\u201d The next stage of this starts on Wednesday at Schalke. \u201cWe want to progress to the quarter-finals and be closer to winning it,\u201d said De Bruyne. \u201cBut to win all four and set that standard is nearly impossible.\u201d When City\u2019s run of only five wins in their last 11 matches in Europe was raised, De Bruyne said: \u201cFirst of all, the level of Champions League is still higher than in the Premier League, that\u2019s why only the best teams play. \u201cSecond it doesn\u2019t matter how many games you lose \u2013 you want to win as many as possible \u2013 but in the end it\u2019s about winning the trophy and trying to perform the best.\u201d John Stones and Gabriel Jesus were unable to travel because of injury and Guardiola said City\u2019s punishing schedule was the reason why. \u201cJohn has a groin problem and Gabriel finished the game in Newport with a hamstring problem. They are not big ones, the doctor told me, but enough of a problem not to be here. That\u2019s normal when you play every three days for three months. We played 25 games in three months.\u201d He then aimed a dig at the European and world governing bodies. \u201cWe are going to finish the season and we will give them three weeks [off]. Then we are going to China to play big clubs in Europe [pre-season] and push them [the players]. Maybe Fifa or Uefa are going to organise another competition for these three weeks we have off.\u201d De Bruyne\u2019s season has been blighted by two serious knee injuries, two months early on and then another six weeks in late autumn. While this means he is fresh, the Belgian believes constant football is of more benefit. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the flow you don\u2019t have to think, when you come back from injury you try to do the same but you are not quick enough, you have to think quicker,\u201d the 27-year-old said. \u201cIt comes natural [when playing regularly] because you are mentally conditioned to play.\u201d Although Schalke are 14th in the Bundesliga, Guardiola remains wary of them. \u201cIf you want to go through, you have to be yourself every minute and after we will see. I want us to be ourselves. It\u2019s a challenge and I\u2019m delighted to face it,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
