The Mandelson-Trimble discussions will fuel suspicions that the former Secretary of State is advising the former First Minister on how to exert pressure on Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Cabinet. Mandelson, who was forced from office over his role in the Hinduja passport affair, also maintains regular contact with Blair. His advice to Trimble at such a crucial stage in the troubled peace process will provide valuable insights into government thinking. Government sources confirmed last night that a timetable for IRA decommissioning was removed from the latest plan on implementing the Good Friday Agreement in order to placate republicans. The timetable had been a key element in the Government's package to salvage the Agreement while Mandelson was still Northern Ireland Secretary. But the decommissioning element drawn up at the beginning of the year was missing from this month's Irish and British government implementation plan - a sign, say critics, that Blair shifted policy to appease the IRA. Mandelson's successor John Reid suspended devolution for one day yesterday in order to buy six weeks breathing space for the Ulster parties to find a deal on decommissioning, police reform and devolution. The Assembly was restored at midnight last night. A senior source close to the negotiations said the Government's initial plan at the start of 2001 was to offer a series of 'inducements' to nationalists - including assurances that the RUC full-time reserve would be phased out and unionist flags and symbols would be removed from the new police service. In return, the Government was prepared to offer unionists a decommissioning timetable which the IRA would have to adhere to. However, the source pointed out that the 'timetable' has been excised from the latest government plans. 'In the absence of this element what is being offered in return to unionists? The original package was going to contain this additional element which has been withdrawn - unless the Government knows something we don't. Otherwise, the Government has shifted,' the source said. There will be further pain for unionists when the government publishes its plans to implement Chris Patten's report on policing reform. The plan includes a suggestion that Belfast be divided into four separate district policing boards. This means that Sinn Fein will dominate the local policing board in their West Belfast stronghold, fuelling unionist fears that republican designs to control the new force may be met. Such a move would be a major concession to Sinn Fein. It goes beyond the recommendations in the Patten Report and is the reason why the British Government is promising Sinn Fein fresh legislation on policing. A spokesman for the Police Federation in Northern Ireland said: 'We would be very concerned about the legitimisation of territories under paramilitary control in Belfast. The city should be one homogenous police unit otherwise there will be an increasing number of people under the control of paramilitary gangs. 'The Federation has written to the Secretary of State this weekend to express its unhappiness about the implementation document, especially given that the very people who are directly affected by it, police officers, were not consulted or shown the package.'
