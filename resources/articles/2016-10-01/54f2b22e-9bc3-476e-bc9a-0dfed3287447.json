The Charlie Hall Chase has also tended, in recent years, to favour youngsters and Cue Card (3.20) will be the oldest winner since 2004 if he comes home in front at Wetherby today. There is no question that the King George winner has the best form on offer and he has also tended to run well when fresh, as when landing this race last year. He has coped well with a sound surface. He is reported in excellent shape by his training team. His status as a 10-year-old is a nagging concern, not least because other ageing chasers have managed to show good things at home immediately before failing on the track. But Cue Card is one of the most durable talents that jump racing has ever produced and, even at odds-on, he appeals as a fair risk to make another successful reappearance. Blaklion can be expected to make him work for it. He probably won a moderate RSA Chase at the last Festival and was put in his place by Native River, a stablemate of Cue Card, at Aintree, but he has been prepared by Nigel Twiston-Davies, who is a master at getting his charges fit for this early stage of the season and has won four Charlie Halls with three different horses. 1.35 Wetherby Harry Whittington has done well with his chasers in the early stages of his career and his French recruit Fou Et Sage could prove well treated for this first run over English fences. His handful of rivals look a beatable bunch. 1.55 Ascot Much improved since joining Fergal O\u2019Brien, Master Dee still looks handicapped to win after a 6lb hike for his 10-length romp at Ludlow three weeks ago. The cheekpieces that went on for the first time that day should still make a difference here. 2.10 Wetherby Youth has been a valuable commodity in this mares\u2019 race, won by three four-year-olds and two five-year-olds in its nine runnings. Miss Crick happens to be the only runner today under the age of six and Alan King\u2019s filly appears on a strong upward curve, judging by her handicap success at Worcester last month. 2.25 Ascot The winner of a good prize at Cheltenham last winter, Pearls Legend copes better than most of these with top-of-the-ground conditions. He reappeared in this race last year and put up a fine effort to be second to a well-treated rival. It is hard to see any of his rivals this time doing something quite so impressive and on that basis he could be the best option. 2.45 Wetherby Much depends here on whether Native River can improve on his old hurdles form, now that he has shown much greater ability over fences. He looks a chaser to these eyes and it will be a surprise if he can turn over Ballyoptic, a Grade One winner at Aintree who managed to win a good handicap on his recent return to action, despite the distance of that race being all of a half-mile short of his optimum. He deserves to be a hot favourite. 3.00 Ascot The first half of the season might be the time to catch Modus, who won his first two outings last autumn before his form tailed off. His only two handicap outings have come in the toughest races and the least propitious circumstances, so he is worth another chance at 12-1 in a less challenging contest. He comes from a stable in red-hot form and would be a shorter price but for the presence in the field of a seemingly more fancied stablemate, Diego Du Charmil, who is up against it as the only four-year-old. 3.35 Ascot Saphir Du Rheu\u2019s handicap rating has tumbled but he is still an odd choice of favourite, given that he has yet to look really comfortable in a battle over fences. The six-year-old Voix D\u2019Eau appeals more, having improved enormously when sent over the larger obstacles last winter. He will be sharper for his reappearance third over too short a distance and is still handicapped to win, judging by his April victory at Cheltenham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
