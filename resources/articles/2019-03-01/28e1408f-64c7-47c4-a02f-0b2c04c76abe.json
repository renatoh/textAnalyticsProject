England play the Netherlands in the Nations League semi-final on 6 June in Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal, five days after the Champions League final in Madrid. Southgate is concerned that if any of his players are involved at the Wanda Metropolitano they may not be available to him. \u201cIt could be a mess,\u201d England\u2019s manager said. \u201cLet\u2019s say if two of our teams made it to the Champions League final then we wouldn\u2019t see them, at best, until the Monday before we play on the Thursday. \u201cAs an Aussie coach [Alastair Clarkson] I know says: \u2018Good luck with that, mate!\u2019 We\u2019ve been in [this] semi-final, qualified six months ago and [are thinking] what a great opportunity to win something, and then you don\u2019t actually get the team together. And with the emotion of that game [Champions League final], can those players even realistically play on the Thursday night for us? \u201cWe\u2019ll have to work out all of that as that goes on. But, fundamentally, our preparation will be here [in England], broken up with breaks at home to give them space that they would all need, bar the players that will play to the very end.\u201d The Premier League season finishes on 12 May, with the FA Cup final the following weekend and the Europa League final on 29 May. Southgate said: \u201cThey would all need a period where they would need to psychologically switch off, and we\u2019d have to look at Champions League final players when we get to it. It will be a little bit like the World Cup in that players will finish at different times.\u201d Southgate named Declan Rice in his squad for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic on Friday week at Wembley and in Montenegro the following Monday. He defended Rice\u2019s decision to choose England after playing for the Republic of Ireland in three friendlies. The 20-year-old West Ham midfielder has been criticised by former Ireland internationals including Kevin Kilbane and Gary Breen and by the former England captain Alan Shearer. Southgate said: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be vocal when you haven\u2019t walked in those shoes. I think he [Rice] spoke really eloquently about being somebody of dual heritage and what that means. \u201cFor me it was easy: I could only play for England so there was no question in my mind, and for lots of people that commented that was the same. There were others who have commented despite the fact that they didn\u2019t play for the country of their birth, so they\u2019ve benefited from some of the rules that are there.\u201d That may have been a reference to Kilbane and Breen, who were born in England. Southgate said: \u201cFundamentally, in this actual instance, he\u2019s a boy that was born in London and educated at an English academy. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too much that he needs to defend. But I understand the fact that there was a senior cap with Ireland, so that was always going to make it more complicated. \u201cBut I think we\u2019ve got to look at his age and normally a player of that age making this decision would be able to do it in a much lower-profile case, as was Michael Keane [Republic of Ireland to England], as was Matt Targett, who came from Scotland, as was the case with David Brooks, who went across to Wales.\u201d Southgate stated he would talk to Jordan Pickford privately after the Everton goalkeeper exchanged words with Newcastle United fans following Saturday\u2019s 3-2 defeat. \u201cI think those sorts of coaching conversations are right for myself and Martyn Margetson [England goalkeeping coach] to have with Jordan individually. It is fairly clear when you see pictures of what\u2019s going on, but I think the detail of how we would want to work and address that, it is important that we are speaking to him and having those coaching conversations in the right environment really,\u201d he said. Southgate said he expected to return to club management at some point, having been promoted from a playing role to take charge of Middlesbrough from June 2006 to October 2009, when he was sacked. He was appointed as head coach of England Under-21s in 2013 and took over the senior side in 2016. \u201cFirst and foremost, I love the job I\u2019m in,\u201d the 48-year-old said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be England manager. We\u2019ve got a second semi-final coming this summer and a Euros at home \u2013 the group stage is at home. So there is no way I\u2019d be walking away from this. \u201cAfter, people might want me or might not want me, here or somewhere else. You can\u2019t look too far ahead in football. You\u2019re quite right, I\u2019m contracted to 2022 or whenever that World Cup will finish. \u201cI\u2019m sure at some point in my life I\u2019ll want to go back to club football because people will say: \u2018Oh well, he did OK as an international manager but he didn\u2019t work as a club manager.\u2019 How could you when you step out the dressing room? What do you know, really, two years into your coaching career?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
