In a letter to the Guardian, the doctors say government policies are \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d, and call on politicians and the media to face the facts of the unfolding ecological emergency and take action. \u201cAs caring professionals we cannot countenance current policies which push the world\u2019s most vulnerable towards progressive environmental catastrophe,\u201d they write. \u201cWe are particularly alarmed by the effects of rising temperatures on health and heed predictions of societal collapse and consequent mass migration. Such collapse risks damage to physical and mental health on an unprecedented scale.\u201d The doctors back the school strike movement, which was started by the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg and is calling for a general climate strike in the autumn. They also back the Extinction Rebellion protests during which thousands of people blocked key sites in London for 10 days in April. \u201cGovernments abrogate their responsibility when pursuing grossly inadequate policies that risk environmental collapse. Nonviolent direct action then becomes the reasonable choice for responsible individuals.\u201d The letter was organised by Bing Jones, a retired associate specialist haematologist from Sheffield, who said it had tapped into a growing concern in the medical profession about the climate crisis. \u201cI am no expert in circulating or organising this sort of thing but within a few weeks we had over 1,000 doctors signed up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have already lost most of our Arctic ice, most of our wild animals, and much of our productive land. Our trajectory is towards a catastrophic 3C of warming or more. To limit the inevitable damage, we must act now.\u201d Several doctors who signed the letter compared the environmental crisis a sick patient. Aarti Bansal, a GP from Sheffield, said: \u201cThe planet has a fever and not unlike us, its systems are breaking down. We have a decade to prevent this fever from getting out of control and we owe it to our children and all life to act like we do in any emergency.\u201d Jones said the issue was like someone seeing blood when they go to the toilet but refusing to accept the doctor\u2019s diagnosis or proposed treatment. \u201cThe warning signs of this emergency are clear and inescapable and we have been told what the treatment is \u2026 now, in a medical situation a patient would not ignore that and neither can we ignore the environmental emergency and its dire consequences for human life,\u201d he said. Another of the signatories, Dr David Pencheon, from the University of Exeter, agreed the \u201cscientific and empirical evidence of climate breakdown\u201d was undeniable. \u201cAll that makes life worth living is at severe risk. This is happening on our watch and will be our legacy. Historians will look back on the first three decades of the 21st century and comment, \u2018They knew so much, yet they nearly did so little,\u2019\u201d said Pencheon, who was director of the sustainable development unit for NHS England and Public Health England. The doctors are backing three demands similar to those outlined by Extinction Rebellion: that governments tell the truth about the scale of the crisis; that there must be \u201ccarbon neutrality within the IPCC timeframe\u201d; and that governments \u201cestablish and are led by citizens\u2019 assemblies to enable climate and ecological justice\u201d. The letter, which is signed mainly by doctors in the UK, follows a separate letter from the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change, which represents all major health bodies and 650,000 healthcare professionals in the UK. Sent earlier this month, the alliance\u2019s letter called on the government to adopt a zero emissions target by 2050. In the US, 70 leading public health groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have issued a statement in which they say the climate crisis is also a health emergency and call on government and businesses to take urgent action. Jones said doctors and medical professionals around the world were waking up to the climate crisis and could become a powerful voice in demanding urgent change. \u201cThere is a growing awareness that this environmental crisis is also a health crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cDoctors are scientifically literate so they understand the facts of this emergency and because they are looking after people every day they are inherently caring so they really get the likely impact. \u201cPoliteness no longer makes sense and inaction is now negligent. Children are rising up to protect their future. We must now take direct action with them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
