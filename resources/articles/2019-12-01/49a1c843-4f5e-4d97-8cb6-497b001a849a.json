The European champions face Flamengo of Brazil in Saturday\u2019s final having overcome the Concacaf champions, Monterrey, in a hard-fought semi-final. Roberto Firmino\u2019s stoppage-time winner was the sixth goal Liverpool have scored in the 90th minute or later this season and, according to Lallana, testament to the attitude and resourcefulness of the unbeaten Premier League leaders. \u201cWe had Hendo [Jordan Henderson] at centre-half and I thought he was magnificent,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cThat is all part of the character and the mentality and why we keep churning out late winners. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d Liverpool to all intents sacrificed their chances of winning the Carabao Cup to bring their strongest available squad to Qatar, with a youth team losing 5-0 at Aston Villa in the quarter-finals less than 24 hours before Wednesday\u2019s win over Monterrey. However, Lallana insisted the opportunity to add the Club World Cup to the Champions League and Uefa Super Cup more than compensates for the domestic difficulties it has created. \u201cIt\u2019s massive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are European champions and to be world club champions as well \u2013 there\u2019s not many people who can say that. We are going to give it our all. It\u2019s like an addiction: you win one medal and you want to win another. You want to win more.\u201d Liverpool lost to a Flamengo team featuring Zico and J\u00fanior in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup \u2013 the first of three final defeats in the tournament for the club \u2013 and Lallana expects another testing occasion against a side who have had several uninterrupted weeks to prepare for the tournament. \u201cIt will be a very tough game,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Bobby [Firmino] and Alisson will give us some inside info into them. We watched them the other day. They were very dynamic, very aggressive, physical, and we will have to recover quickly. Another trophy is up for grabs so bring it on. It\u2019s all about recovery now. It\u2019s a good job it didn\u2019t go to extra time. We will get in the ice baths, get the massages and all guns blazing for Saturday.\u201d Despite the luxury of bringing Firmino, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Trent Alexander-Arnold off the bench to decide the semi-final, Klopp\u2019s options in defence were severely limited with Virgil van Dijk missing through illness. The influential centre-half did some fitness work on Thursday but not a proper training session and is being monitored. Henderson, who stepped into the void in the absence of Dejan Lovren, Jo\u00ebl Matip and Fabinho, said he would happily play there for only the second time if it helps Liverpool claim their third trophy of the year. \u201cThat was different,\u201d the Liverpool captain joked of his central defensive performance against Monterrey. \u201cI had fantastic players around me and they helped me out. It was different to anything that I have been used to. I\u2019ve played at full-back but I\u2019ve never played there before. I just tried to do my best for the team and thankfully we got the win. I don\u2019t know what will happen with Virgil on Saturday. Fingers crossed he will be OK. Of course, if the manager needed me to go there again, I would do it. It is anything to help the team. \u201cWe wanted to get to the final and we want to win. We have done the first bit by getting to the final and now we want to win it. That\u2019s the mentality of this team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
