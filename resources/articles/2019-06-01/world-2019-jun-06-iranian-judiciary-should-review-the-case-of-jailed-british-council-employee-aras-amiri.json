As artists, arts organisation leaders and academics across the UK and internationally who know Aras through her studies and curatorial work, we are dismayed by this statement and its accompanying 10-year prison sentence. We recognise that this is a time of intense international pressure on Iran which must be resolved peacefully. However, we reject the claims of this verdict cast upon a generous, caring person who has only worked to enable a better, positive understanding of Iranian literary and artistic heritage. In her role with the British Council, Aras Amiri facilitated Iranian arts exhibitions, theatre performances, music concerts, film seasons and literary publications which respectfully and sensitively made accessible to UK audiences the extraordinary history and achievements of Iranian arts and culture within an international perspective. We request that the Iranian judiciary revises its decision. We ask that a more reasoned assessment of these charges and whatever is motivating them is dealt with through formal diplomatic channels without targeting Iranian citizens dedicated to the art of their country.
