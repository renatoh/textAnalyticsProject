The Argentina striker believes the Old Trafford fans will give him a warm reception, meaning a favourable one. Sir Alex Ferguson agrees the reception might be warm, though is not sure how favourable. Mark Hughes thinks Tevez left Manchester United on much friendlier terms than Adebayor left Arsenal and feels there is still mutual affection between the player and his old club. Tevez is struggling to overcome a knee injury sustained on international duty, though if there is any chance of him playing, or being fit enough to sit on the bench, Hughes intends to use him. \"He's very keen to play and we'd like to use him,\" Hughes said. \"It is purely a medical matter. If he is fit he'll play. If he is not ready to come back, then we won't be stupid enough to rush him.\" Direct transfers between the Manchester rivals are rare and will become rarer still should City achieve their aim of becoming one of United's top-four rivals. Throw in the \u00a325m transfer fee that now seems to have almost doubled due to hidden costs, and the fact that City's use of Tevez's image on a provocative poster campaign prompted Ferguson to accuse them of \"arrogance\" again yesterday, and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that, far from shying away from signing their rivals' players, the Eastlands hierarchy is seeking head-on confrontation. \"It just tells you how much money they have to spend,\" Ferguson said, regarding City's apparent determination to have Tevez whatever the cost. Hughes vehemently denies the suggestion that City paid over the odds just to spite United. \"We didn't sign Carlos just to make a statement. We went for him because he is a world-class striker and he was available,\" he said. \"We are convinced we have made a fantastic signing. We didn't do it just because we could.\" The deal shows nevertheless that City are immune from the financial constraints affecting most clubs \u2013 even United. \"Tevez was a good player for us, he did his job here well and I've no complaints about that,\" Ferguson said. \"He felt he didn't play enough football in his last season and maybe he had a point. You can't keep all the players all the time. Cristiano Ronaldo proved that. We had six good seasons out of him then it was time to move on. \"You can't keep everyone happy, especially these days when some players appear to be dominated by their agents. Gabriel Heinze was only here a year and then he wanted away. That surprised me but the next day he picked up a cruciate injury, so he had to stay. Then as soon as he was fit again he wanted away again. I'm certainly not envious of City picking up Tevez, I've got my squad and I'm happy with it but, as I say, they are playing to different financial rules to everyone else. I could have bought a player for \u00a352m in summer had I wanted to [Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's Sergio Aguero has a buy-out clause for roughly that amount, though Ferguson could have been referring to Franck Rib\u00e9ry or even Karim Benzema] but I didn't think it was worth it. I didn't think the summer just past was a particularly good time to buy any players. Prices were too high all round.\" City think otherwise. Hughes's task, not helped by Adebayor's ban and injuries to Roque Santa Cruz and Tevez, is to show their money was well spent. \"Our first objective was to make a good start, and we've done that,\" Hughes said. \"Now we've got the huge challenge of matching Manchester United \u2013 not just over one or two games but over the course of a season. We've got to do what they did to Liverpool and knock them off their perch. I was a United player when Liverpool were at their peak and I know how hard that is going to be. They had a certain mind-set, a winning mentality. When you win things together it helps bond you as a group and we've got to try and start that process. It just happens that United are the benchmark at the moment and they are in the same city as us, but success often goes in cycles. That's what we've got to hope.\" Hughes must also hope Ferguson gets on his bike sooner rather than later, for as long as he remains in charge and in good health, City seem destined to be regarded as upstarts. \"They don't bother me,\" Ferguson said, protesting only a little too much. \"This game is no bigger than the ones we play against Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea every season. City are out to be a top-four team, fine. We're out to be the top team. The challenge at this club is always to be number one. That's my job.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
