Those seen as most at risk are being equipped with security alarms amid fears that a winter poll dominated by Brexit could turn violent. Many have also been advised not to campaign after dark or alone, and not to enter people\u2019s homes even if the weather is bad, as the country heads towards what is expected to be the most fiercely fought and unpredictable election in recent times. On Saturday the former Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach, a prominent Remainer who was stripped of the whip by Boris Johnson in September and last week defected to the Liberal Democrats, told the Observer she had been equipped by parliament with a security device that triggered an immediate armed police response in the event of an incident. Sandbach, who will contest the seat of Eddisbury in Cheshire, said: \u201cI am not going to be put off campaigning by threats and online trolls. But we do have to take measures to ensure our safety.\u201d She added that Cheshire Police had recently issued guidance to all MPs and candidates in the area about how to campaign safely, which included the need for them to be accompanied by at least one party worker at all times. Labour MP Luke Pollard, whose parliamentary office in central Plymouth has been attacked on two recent occasions by vandals, said that he and his staff would all be carrying personal attack alarms following advice from party bosses. \u201cI will be carrying it at all times. It has a button that you press that connects to a network where an operator will listen in immediately wherever I am,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cWhen you press it you\u2019re supposed to say things like: \u2018Put the knife down\u2019 or \u2018Please don\u2019t point that at me\u2019 or \u2018What are you doing in my house?\u2019 and the operator can coordinate the response.\u201d MPs last week voted to hold the first winter election since February 1974, less than a fortnight before Christmas, in order to break the parliamentary deadlock over Brexit. But many MPs and candidates are privately dreading knocking on doors in the dark, knowing they will be confronted by intense anger over Brexit. One Labour MP from a Leave seat in the Midlands said: \u201cIt will be awful, as it will be on almost every doorstep. People saying \u2018we voted for Brexit in 2016. Why have you not delivered?\u2019\u201d The latest Opinium poll for the Observer suggests Brexit will be uppermost in voters\u2019 minds. While many cite the NHS as a more important issue, 40% name Brexit as the main issue affecting their vote, against 18% for the NHS. The Labour MP for Batley and Spen, Tracy Brabin, said she and her team had discussed campaign safety measures in a meeting with councillors on Friday, including her campaign co-ordinator who was a close friend of Jo Cox, the Labour MP murdered by a rightwing extremist days before the 2016 Brexit referendum. A decision was taken to avoid campaigning on the streets of Brabin\u2019s constituency, in west Yorkshire, from 5pm onwards. \u201cNobody\u2019s campaigning at night,\u201d Brabin said. \u201cIn the evenings we\u2019ll probably be doing a lot of phone banking; we\u2019re just going to have to be a lot more cautious because people are cross.\u201d Paula Ferguson, the Liberal Democrat candidate in Winchester, Hants, said her party was reinforcing the advice that MPs should not campaign alone, particularly in the dark. Although she did not feel in danger she said that she would be wary of entering people\u2019s homes. \u201cI do not feel like I am in danger \u2013 but we did not think Jo Cox was in danger,\u201d Ferguson said. Boris Johnson was widely criticised in September for appearing to dismiss as \u201chumbug\u201d MPs\u2019 concerns over their safety. Last week the culture secretary Nicky Morgan and the former home secretary Amber Rudd joined a growing number of Conservative moderates who have announced they will not stand for election. Morgan, who was a strong Remainer but joined Johnson\u2019s cabinet because of her belief that delivering Brexit with a deal was the only way forward, said \u201cthe clear impact on my family and the other sacrifices involved in, and the abuse for, doing the job of a modern MP\u201d was part of the reason for her decision. Brabin added: \u201cMy problem is that I love chattering. Sometimes I get left behind (on doorsteps). I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m nervous of the electorate. What I\u2019m saying is that I don\u2019t want my volunteers to be put into positions where they feel uncomfortable.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
