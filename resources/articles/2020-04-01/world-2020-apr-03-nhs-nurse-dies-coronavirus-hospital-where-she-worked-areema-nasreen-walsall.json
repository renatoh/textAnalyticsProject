Areema Nasreen died shortly after midnight on Friday in intensive care at Walsall Manor hospital in the West Midlands, where she had worked for 16 years. Nasreen, who has three children, and was from Walsall, developed symptoms of coronavirus on 13 March, including aches, a high temperature and then a cough. She tested positive for the virus last Friday. In a tribute posted on Facebook, her friend Rubi Aktar said: \u201cShe was the most loveliest, genuine person you could ever meet, she went above and beyond for everyone she met. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful that I had the honour to call her my best friend, she saw me at my best and my worst and accepted my every flaw. I am so broken that words can\u2019t explain.\u201d A relative told Birmingham Live: \u201cThe immediate family are devastated. Everyone is in shock this morning. She was always so full of life. She was devoted to her job as a nurse, she absolutely loved it. \u201cShe passed away doing what she loved. I\u2019m really sad for the rest of the family, she was a fantastic person.\u201d The mother of three qualified as a staff nurse in January last year and worked at the hospital\u2019s acute medical unit. She worked at Walsall Manor hospital from 2003, in housekeeping and as a healthcare assistant before studying to become a nurse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
