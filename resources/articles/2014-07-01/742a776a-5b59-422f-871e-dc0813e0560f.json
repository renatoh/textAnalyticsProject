Unveiling the corporation's annual report, the director general, Tony Hall, reveals that the corporation spent \u00a3194m on presenters and other on-air talent in the year to the end of March, down from \u00a3200m the previous year. Hall is expected to claim that after a difficult period, including the Jimmy Savile scandal and widespread criticism of excessive executive payoffs and a failed IT project that cost licence-fee payers nearly \u00a3100m, the BBC is back on a more even keel. He will also seek to raise morale among staff battered by years of cost-cutting \u2013 another 415 job losses were announced in BBC News last week \u2013 by revealing that some of the money freed up by the efficiency drive will be reinvested in a 4% boost to the content budget over the next three years. This is likely to equate to an extra \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m, with one of the priorities for extra investment expected to be drama. The BBC's TV, radio and online services are facing a 26% real-terms cut in funding as the corporation seeks to save \u00a3800m a year by 2017, to meet targets imposed after the flat 2010 licence-fee deal and free up money to invest in new initiatives. The latest round of cost-cutting includes a proposal to make the youth-oriented TV channel BBC3 online only. \"Our finances may have been diminished but our ambition to deliver the best-quality output for licence payers remains,\" a senior BBC source said. \"Clearly we have not got everything right in the past but we are now on the right track. We are delivering content audiences love and there's more to come in the next few years.\" As part of the general pressure to cut costs, the BBC has been paying particular attention to bearing down on the salaries paid to top talent, after big-money deals with the likes of Jonathan Ross attracted critical headlines. Hall will announce that the BBC has cut its talent bill by 15% since 2009, when criticism of its payments to top stars was at its height, by driving down salaries as deals are renegotiated and the departure of some of the most highly paid presenters, including Ross, who left in 2010. The latest annual report is expected to detail a further reduction in the number of on-screen stars falling into the top pay category, earning between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a35m a year, which is understood to include the likes of Graham Norton and Jeremy Clarkson. Reid, the BBC Breakfast presenter, was the most high-profile departure during the last financial year, quitting the corporation in March to join the rival ITV early-morning show Good Morning Britain. Reid is reportedly on about \u00a3400,000 a year at ITV, so would not have fallen into the BBC's top talent pay category. It is understood that Jeremy Paxman did, and the veteran presenter's departure from Newsnight in June is likely to help the BBC reduce its talent bill further in the current financial year. Other high-profile departures as the BBC seeks to drive down talent costs further include the Panorama reporter John Sweeney and Radio 5 Live's presenters Richard Bacon, Victoria Derbyshire and Shelagh Fogarty. Derbyshire, though, is joining the BBC News channel to present a daily news and current affairs programme. Hall has indicated in several speeches since last autumn that he regards drama as a key programming genre that should be at the heart of the BBC's public service offering and he has also been told by the BBC Trust to improve BBC1's peak-time drama output. With a 4% boost in content spending planned over the next three years, drama seems certain to receive significant extra investment. Sherlock and Doctor Who are international hits and BBC1 has enjoyed recent success with the likes of Call the Midwife, Last Tango in Halifax and Happy Valley, but critics argue that there is not enough high-quality drama on the channel. Other areas Hall has highlighted as central to the BBC's public service remit include news and current affairs, music and arts. Hall will also announce that the BBC has continued to reduce the number of senior managers \u2013 by 8% in the last financial year. The number of executives paid more than \u00a3100,000 a year has also been cut again, from 245 to 232."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
