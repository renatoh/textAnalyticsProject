The two groups are already cooperating on various projects around Sakhalin Island in Russia but well-placed sources said a \"stream of dialogue\" was taking place about other opportunities. Offshore exploration projects in the east of Russia are among the joint ventures being discussed as BP chief executive Lord Browne took what his company described as \"a good strategic and commercial investment\" in Rosneft. Shares in Rosneft started full trading for the first time yesterday and ended the day a shade below their launch price of $7.55. The float began following a dramatic - but unsuccessful - attempt to halt the process by rival Russian firm Yukos. The company, founded by now-jailed oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, claimed in the high court that Rosneft had unlawfully obtained the bulk of its assets from Yukos in a sham auction run by the state. Mr Justice Charles expressed surprise at the way a small company had been able to buy the Yukanskneftegaz business and sell it on to Rosneft but he turned down the Yukos claim on a point of law. A Yukos spokeswoman said an appeal would be lodged within seven days but Rosneft sources said they were confident it would be defeated, pointing out that a range of other challenges by Yukos had been unsuccessful. Rosneft raised $10.4bn in the float - the world's sixth biggest - which valued the Russian oil business at $80bn. The Russian state remains by far the biggest investor but British institutions took a quarter of the shares. BP has been hit by further problems in the US where it recently brought in a new boss, Robert Malone, to clean up its image. Twelve producing wells at its Prudhoe Bay and North Star operations in Alaska have been closed down following a whistleblowing operation by BP staff. The 12 are the last of 57 wells that were still operating and have been leaking oil. A BP spokesman said it was being \"extra cautious\" by closing down the wells, which were a fraction of the 2,200 it operated there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
