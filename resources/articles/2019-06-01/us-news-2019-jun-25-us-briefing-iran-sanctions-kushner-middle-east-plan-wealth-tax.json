Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Tehran says \u2018idiotic\u2019 sanctions have cut off path to diplomacy Iran says the Trump administration\u2019s \u201coutrageous and idiotic\u201d decision to impose new sanctions on its supreme leader and eight senior military chiefs has permanently closed the door to diplomacy between Tehran and Washington. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, said on Tuesday that the White House was \u201cafflicted by mental retardation\u201d. The US is also planning sanctions against Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal that Donald Trump has torn up. \u2018Strong and proportionate.\u2019 As he signed the executive order on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said the \u201chard-hitting\u201d sanctions were \u201ca strong and proportionate response to Iran\u2019s increasingly provocative actions\u201d. Kushner to launch \u2018fantasy\u2019 economic plan for Palestinians Jared Kushner is expected to unveil his economic blueprint for peace in the Middle East at a conference in Bahrain on Tuesday, despite the fact that neither Israeli nor Palestinian officials will be present. Kushner\u2019s so-called \u201cpeace to prosperity\u201d plan calls for $50bn to be invested in the occupied territories and neighbouring countries, which Kushner claims would create a million jobs and double the size of the Palestinian economy. Vanity project. Without a workable political solution to the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the plan is seen as little more than a vanity project for the president\u2019s son-in-law. Absent enemies. The Palestinians boycotted the Bahrain conference over the Trump administration\u2019s unequivocal support for Israel, and a late decision was taken not to invite Israeli officials. Trump says sexual assault accuser E Jean Carroll \u2018not my type\u2019 Trump has said the New York advice columnist who accused him of sexually assaulting her in a department store dressing room two decades ago is \u201cnot my type\u201d, as he denied the latest such allegations against him in an interview with the Hill. E Jean Carroll claimed the future president forced himself on her during their encounter at Manhattan\u2019s Bergdorf Goodman store in 1995 or 1996, in an extract from her forthcoming book about the \u201chideous men\u201d she has encountered in her life. Police complaint. Carroll has said she would consider working with police on a criminal investigation into the alleged attack, though the statute of limitations on such a complaint has already passed. Disney, Soros and other billionaires call for tax on wealth George Soros, Abigail Disney, the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and more than a dozen other billionaires have called on the US government to tax extreme wealth in order to address inequality and provide funding for climate crisis initiatives and public health projects. In a letter addressed to all 2020 presidential candidates, the 19 signatories said: \u201cAmerica has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more.\u201d Warren proposal. Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed a \u201cwealth tax\u201d of 2% on fortunes of $50m or more, and a further 1% on assets over $1bn, which she estimates would affect 75,000 families and raise $2.75tn over 10 years. Sanders\u2019 plan. Bernie Sanders has unveiled his plan to wipe out $1.6tn in student loan debt owed by 45 million Americans \u2013 and to pay for it through a tax on Wall Street. Crib sheet A UN human rights expert has warned that the world is sliding towards \u201cclimate apartheid\u201d, whereby the rich pay to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis, while others suffer extreme poverty, hunger and the decline of democracy. The US government has removed all but 30 of more than 300 migrant children from a border patrol facility in Texas, after reports that the young detainees were being held in \u201cinhumane conditions\u201d without adequate water, food or sanitation. A former Brazilian ambassador to the US has told the Guardian he is \u201cdisgusted\u201d by his country\u2019s foreign policy under its far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, whose diplomatic chiefs represent a \u201clunatic fringe\u201d. The British actor Dame Judi Dench has defended the work of her disgraced friends Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, despite condemning their alleged personal misconduct. \u201cYou cannot deny somebody a talent,\u201d she told the Radio Times magazine. Must-reads Stonewall at 50: why the gay bar remains as vital as ever Fifty years after New York\u2019s Stonewall Inn became a symbol for LGBTQ activism, gay bars are declining in numbers across the US. Yet in some areas, particularly in less progressive states and communities, they remain a rallying point at times of both trial and celebration, as Dominic Rushe reports. Toxic America: the risk chemicals pose to children Today in our Toxic America series, we focus on the effects on children of the chemicals in our everyday life. Lauren Zanolli explains how to mitigate the risks to infants, while Emily Holden reports on concerns over chemicals in playgrounds, and Leonardo Trasande argues banning dangerous chemicals could save the US billions. How leftwing economists are transforming capitalism Since the 1970s, the left has changed how many people think about prejudice, personal identity and freedom, while surrendering economics to the right. But now, writes Andy Beckett, a transatlantic movement of leftwing economists is building a practical alternative to neoliberalism. The police endorsing violence and racism on Facebook The Plain View project has collated a database of more than 5,000 hateful, racist and Islamophobic messages posted by officers in eight US police departments \u2013 many of whom have been removed from active duty as a result. Adam Gabbatt speaks to the lawyer who launched the project. Opinion The Democratic presidential field will engage in four hours of televised debates this week. How much of that time will be devoted to questions on the climate emergency? Not nearly enough, says Kate Aronoff. When candidate Jay Inslee inquired about doing a special climate-themed debate, the DNC threatened to bar him and any other candidate who participated from the official primary debates. Why not dare them to try? Sport The US will face their toughest Women\u2019s World Cup test so far when they play France in the quarter-finals, after overcoming Spain 2-1 thanks to a pair of penalties. Also on Monday, Canada were knocked out by Sweden, while Fifa launched an investigation into Cameroon\u2019s behaviour in their loss to England. Rafael Ben\u00edtez is bowing out at Newcastle United after the club and its coach failed to reach an agreement on a new contract. Though held in great affection by fans, Ben\u00edtez\u2019s dealings with the club\u2019s owner, Mike Ashley, had long been dysfunctional, as Louise Taylor reports.
