But the All Blacks were simply sensational in the second half. Ben Smith and Nehe Milner-Skudder were the stand-out players, but Sam Cane also played very well at flanker. New Zealand can now put their feet up and watch France v Ireland on Sunday \u2013 they will face the loser of that contest in the quarter-final. Now confirmed as the runner-up in Pool C, Argentina will face the winner of that clash. Tonga are out, but that is more down to their crucial defeat to Georgia a few weeks ago than their performance here tonight, which fluctuated from the sublime to the frazzled. They finish in fourth behind the Georgians, who automatically qualify for the 2019 World Cup. Nonu got his try, and organised the All Blacks midfield defence stoutly. He certainly had a night to remember and was carried off the field at St James Park on the shoulders on his team-mates: a nice touch, that. Tonga\u2019s players give their supporters a cheer on a lap of honour around the pitch. Tonight at least, they\u2019ve got a lot to be proud of. That\u2019s all from me, thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets. See you next time. Bye! Tonga are out of the World Cup. New Zealand top Pool C. 80 min: Tonga have the ball as they push for that all-elusive try. It\u2019s not happening. 79 min: Milner-Skudder gets the man-of-the-match award \u2013 he\u2019s been excellent especially in this second half, but it could just have easily gone to Ben Smith, who has been at the heart of everything for the All Blacks. He\u2019s got his try! A loose Tongan kick again isn\u2019t chased up and New Zealand have acres of space to counter attack once they move it left. Milner-Skudder has the freedom of St James\u2019 Park but draws Fosita nicely and released Nonu on the wing, who canters into the corner for his landmark score. Carter is the first to congratulate his old mucker, everyone is obviously delighted for the dreadlocked centre. Carter misses the conversion, his first mistake of the night with the boot. 76 min: STREAKER ON THE PITCH! It is Friday night in Newcastle, after all. 74 min: Tonga aren\u2019t done yet. They win a penalty and go for the corner. But they can\u2019t secure the ball, and New Zealand clear. Nonu showed all his experience, rush defence there. Not the most memorable match for Nonu on his 100th cap, but he\u2019s gone about his business efficiently. Ah, that\u2019s why Hansen didn\u2019t bring Carter off. The No10 knocks it over 10 metres from the touchline. Predictably, New Zealand make Tonga pay. It\u2019s a simple set-piece but Latu can no nothing to stop Cane from five yards out. 70 min: This could get messy for Tonga now that they\u2019re down to 14. 69 min: Tonga\u2019s frustration finally shows: Taumalolo, the replacement hooker, dump tackles Carter to the turf, leaving him in a heap. That is a horribly dangerous tackle, he completely upended the All Black No10, who has taken a battering all night. Yellow card for Taumalolo, fully deserved. When will Steve Hansen hook Carter? Give the guy a break! 67 min: More substitutions for the All Blacks: Liam Messam and Keven Mealamu on for Sam Whitelock and Dane Coles. Aaron Smith shows his class, looking left and passing right as Sonny Bill Williams walks through a Pacific-sized gap to score under the posts with his first touch. Carter does his thing. Suddenly this score looks respectable from the All Blacks point of view. They are smiling now! Something I don\u2019t think I saw in the first half. 63 min: All Blacks are into Tongan territory again, it\u2019s now a case of whether Tonga can hang on. Captain Latu looks like the only one that\u2019s interested \u2013 he takes Carter to task after the fly-half makes a break. 61 min: Couple of substitutions to update you on for the All Blacks: Sonny Bill Williams on for Conrad Smith, Ben Franks on for Owen Franks. Carter remains 100% for the evening. He\u2019s scored again! I said he might not be the quickest wing New Zealand have ever had, but he sure showed some wheels there, latching onto a clever grubber kick from Beauden Barrett. The sub showed outstanding vision there, saw the space behind. The All Blacks have finally hit their stride. 57 min: Straight from the kick-off, Ben Smith retrieves the ball. New Zealand are on the offensive again. Tonga are looking a little ragged. 55 min: Milner-Skudder isn\u2019t the biggest, the quickest, the most dynamic wing New Zealand have ever had but he\u2019s got a frightening step and his footballing skills are up there with the best \u2013 he has also caught the high ball well and is always looking for the off-load. This is only his fifth All Black cap, but it\u2019s also his fifth try. From the line-out, New Zealand go back to basics. Keeping the ball in the forwards, they brutally march through the Tongan 22. There are maybe 15-16 phases as the Tongans never get anywhere near a turnover, such is the ferocity of Cane\u2019s clearouts. Aaron Smith eventually spins it right to Milner-Skudder who dodges Naholo and gets over for the try. Carter converts for a 15-point lead. 50 min: Tonga are penalised for taking the man without the ball, and New Zealand kick for the corner. They don\u2019t need the bonus point of course, but that\u2019s what they\u2019re gunning for. Nothing less than they deserve. Read is back on after his yellow card. 47 min: This is hugely impressive stuff! Tonga\u2019s offloads are sensational, they are teaching the All Blacks a thing or two at the moment! Tonga are just 10 metres out, and spin it wide, but ahhhh, it\u2019s lost forward. But the referee was playing advantage, Tonga will have a kick at goal for their sterling efforts. 46 min: Again, Tonga look most dangerous around the fringes, picking and going with ball in hand. Vainikolo, who recently left Exeter for Oyonnax, then Latu, then Tonga\u2019uiha all make ground. They\u2019re into the New Zealand 22 again! 44 min: The referee calls time off after Taione takes a blow to the head. But the hooker is back on his feet, he\u2019ll be OK to continue. 43 min: Just to remind you, Read has about two more minutes in the sin bin until he is allowed to come on again. Try-scorer Tony Woodcock has picked up a knock, he will be substituted for Wyatt Crockett. That will worry Steve Hansen, the last thing he needs is unnecessary injuries. 42 min: Ben Smith has probably been the pick of the All Black players and he makes another darting run through the heart of the Tongan defence after a cute pass from Aaron Smith. Lilo eventually brings him down and Tonga scramble a defence, eventually Ben Smith is penalised for not releasing. Peeep! We\u2019re off again. Nonu is wearing some specially designed boots to commemorate his 100th cap, by the way. Tasteful. Half-time, in-flight entertainment Nice video, but can anyone guess what is a bit wrong with this? (Israel Dagg was dropped from New Zealand\u2019s final World Cup squad...) New Zealand lead, but it\u2019s been a poor half by their extremely high standards. Handling errors going forward, and they\u2019ve been battered around the fringes in defence. Tonga should hold their heads high. 40 min+2 min: Eventually Tonga get it out and they pile it all their bodies with the ball just inches from the line. New Zealand are defending desperately as one Tongan body \u2013 is that Latu? \u2013 dives over. Did he get it down? It\u2019s impossible to tell and the TMO is none the wiser when he is asked for a decision. No try, and the referee calls for half-time. Boos rain down from the stands, the Tongans deserved something there. 40 min+1: We\u2019re into extra time at the end of the first half. New Zealand concede two further penalties from the subsequent scrums. Why hasn\u2019t a penalty try been awarded? They are killing the scrum. 39 min: Tonga scrum down! Can they get a score before the break. \u201cLet\u2019s go Blacks, come on brothers\u201d scream Aaron Smith as he encourages his underperforming forwards into action. 37 min: The penalty is probably within range of the posts, but Tonga kick for the corner! Great ambition from the islanders. They win their line-out and embark on an almightly driving maul, which the All Blacks have no answers for. New Zealand are driven all the way back to their own try line! Kieran Read collapses the maul, and promptly receives a yellow card. Deserved, that was cynical, off to the sin bin he goes. Penalty for Tonga under the posts. 35 min: Oh that\u2019s a shame! Tonga spin it wide but just as the ball reaches Veainu, who is one on one with Ben Smith, the ball is passed forward. The whistle goes, and Smith upends the Tongan winger anyway. It looks like the referee is going to penalise Smith for a dangerous tackle! Penalty to Tonga. From maybe five yards right of the posts, Carter adds the extras. Tonga simply can\u2019t live with New Zealand when the Kiwis step it up a gear or two. Again, it\u2019s not a complicated score: Naholo comes off his wing to break a couple of tackles, Cane and Kaino clear out at the breakdown superbly and Aaron Smith uses the quick ball well, popping the ball right to Woodcock who crashes over from three yards out. There\u2019s no stopping him at that range. 29 min: Two expert offloads, first from Milner-Skudder and then from Carter, mean that the All Blacks again break into Tonga\u2019s 22. New Zealand spin it wide and Coles \u2013 that is NEW ZEALAND HOOKER DANE COLES \u2013 chips a kick out to Naholo. Tonga scramble their defence but they\u2019re living on the edge here. 28 min: Tonga fail to properly chased a high kick and Ben Smith counter-attacks. He is suddenly in the clear, and New Zealand have a four on two situation. They must surely score again \u2026 no! Naholo inexplicably drops the ball, under no pressure whatsoever! Head in hands stuff for the winger. That\u2019s their fourth handling error! With all the accuracy of a young Alan Shearer, Tonga\u2019s No10 slots it through the posts. 23 min: Tonga put their first real attack of note together, steadily making ground from the half-way line into the All Black 22. Sniping round the fringes and it\u2019s working! Tonga are through 15 phases and counting! Penalty! Woodcock is penalised for not moving away with Tonga just seven metres from New Zealand\u2019s line. 21 min: Woodcock is down and receives some treatment after he is driven back. All 19 stone of him. 19 min: In his first real contribution of the day, Nonu knocks the ball on, following an excellent tackle from Piutau. 16 min: Ooof! Ma\u2019afu puts in his second big hit of the night. Shuddering stuff. It will be interesting to see how long Tonga can keep this tempo up. This is the oldest ever line-up at a World Cup. Dan Carter adds two more to his considerable tally. Told you. There are three Smiths in this All Black side \u2013 Aaron, Conrad and Ben \u2013 and the latter two exchange brilliantly for this opening score. It\u2019s not the most enterprising try we will ever see New Zealand score, but Tonga just couldn\u2019t live with the fast hands out wide. Cane, Milner-Skudder and Conrad Smith popped the ball left and right out of the the despairing reach of Piutau and Fosita and Ben Smith can onto the ball at pace. St James Park erupts! 10 min: No score after 10 minutes, but fear not: points are surely not far away \u2026 8 min: The other All Black centurion? \u201cJustin Marshall? Seems he\u2019s the only other AB in the pro era with that level of longevity,\u201d suggests Risha Mohyeddin. Nope. Christopher Lane reckons Grant Fox. Nope. \u201cYay! I know this,\u201d emails kavanaghnz, \u201cthe quiet achiever Mils Muliaina...\u201d Ding ding ding! 6 min: Tonga will be happy with this start. New Zealand haven\u2019t shown a lot of fluency so far. Aaron Smith tries a box kick but it\u2019s successfully charged down by his opposite number Takulua. For a moment it looks like Vainikolo might latch onto it, but Read comes across and dives on top of the ball with his considerable frame. 4 min: New Zealand spread it wide, and they have a man over on the wing! But it\u2019s the hooker Dane Coles... he doesn\u2019t quite have the pace to burn Naholo on the outside. 2 min: Smith, Conrad that is, fails to catch a high ball and Vainikolo capitalises, sprinting up the middle, making a good 30 metres. Eventually he is halted, and Tonga give away a penalty. They have got to be disciplined tonight if they have any hope. 1 min: Fosita tries a grubber kick but Carter is alert it and dives on the ball. Before he is back on his feet, he is absolutely nailed by Ma\u2019afu. The first of many big hits tonight, no doubt. Peeep peeep! We\u2019re off! Tonga line up in two lines to perform their Sipi Tau, and not a second after they finish, the All Blacks respond with their haka, lead by Read in a Christmas tree/flying V formation. Tasty. The teams emerge from the tunnel, Tonga in their red shirts and white shorts, the All Blacks in \u2026 you know the rest. Nonu, not stand-in captain Kieran Read, leads New Zealand out. We\u2019ll have the anthems and then \u2026 the haka and Sipi Tau! The Tongans are up first. Four other centurions (Richie McCaw, Dan Carter, Tony Woodcock, Keven Mealaumu) are also in Newcastle tonight. Can you name the only other All Black to reach a century of caps? Answers to michael.butler@theguardian.com or @MichaelButler18, please. And do send your thoughts, predictions, etc to the same place. I\u2019d love to hear from ya. Some Tongans have braved the brisk Newcastle air \u2026 \u2026 but it\u2019s fair to say that most of Newcastle\u2019s finest have swapped the black and white stripes for all-black. Steve Hansen, meanwhile \u2026 The odds are certainly stacked against Tonga but the Pacific islanders are certainly capable of a shock. Remember 2011 anyone? In their last group game four years ago, Tonga beat France \u2013 which probably was the greatest ever World Cup upset \u2026 until Japan did their thing against South Africa last month. There is plenty to play for in Pool C. Despite winning all their matches so far, New Zealand are still not yet assured of top spot going into their final game tonight, although only a bonus-pointless defeat to Tonga and a bonus-point victory for Argentina over Namibia on Sunday would mean the Pumas pip the All Blacks. Which isn\u2019t really going to happen is it? Tonga\u2019s task is simple: beat the All Blacks to finish third (ahead of Georgia) in the pool and automatically qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Simple to understand, anyway. It may or may not surprise you that Tonga\u2019s biggest ever defeat came against the All Blacks, a 102-0 trouncing back in 2000. And so when the two nations met in the 2003 World Cup, somebody in the Tongan camp decided it would be a good idea to try and different tact. Something to disrupt New Zealand\u2019s rhythm. Something to throw them off. And so, on that day, Tonga interrupted the All Blacks\u2019 haka with their own Sipi Tau, resulting in an electrifying stand-off. The match finished 91-7 to New Zealand, which Tonga could count as an improvement. One of the nine try-scorers that day was 21-year-old Dan Carter, just was just four months into his All Black career, as was a certain Ma\u2019a Nonu. The centre, with his long locks and imposing frame, is the kind of player that seems like he has played for New Zealand for all-eternity \u2013 and how All Black fans wish that was the case \u2013 but tonight is his 100th cap. Bravo Ma\u2019a. For tonight\u2019s match, All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has made six changes, the biggest absence of course being Richie McCaw, who suffered a thigh injury against Georgia last week. He has trained this week and will be available for the knock-outs, but Steve Hansen has decided to rest his captain for this bone-crunching finale in Pool C. Probably for the best, that. Kieran Read skippers the side tonight. Meanwhile, Tonga coach Mana Otai has made one change to his team following their 45-16 defeat to Argentina with inside centre Latiume Fosita coming in for Sione Piukala. It\u2019s the All Blacks! We\u2019re going to see both the haka and the Sipi Tau, possibly at the same time (although Tonga will probably think twice about that). It\u2019s the freaking weekend baby, I\u2019m about to have me some fun. Kick off: 8pm BST, 8am in New Zealand and Tonga.
