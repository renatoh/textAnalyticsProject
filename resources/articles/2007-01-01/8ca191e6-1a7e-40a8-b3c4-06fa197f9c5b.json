Jackson-Stops &amp; Staff, 01823 325144. Because... It's most sane people's private winter fantasy. And you are closer to heaven in the most literal sense since the village is the highest on the southern slopes of the Quantocks, and this thatched glory occupies the loftiest perch. The best of Somerset lies spread below your casements - and from the terrace off one of the four living rooms, you can gaze over to Exmoor. You can crouch on slate floors before one of two wood-burning stoves. The five bedrooms are floored with oak, there's a 22ft utility room and the whole confection is trussed up with roses and clematis. Planners have agreed to a cottage on the site of the garage and there's the option to buy 27 acres of wood and pasture. It's a shame that... Much of the garden is challengingly sloped and there is no local shop. Wreck of the week Kirby Mills, Kirkbymoorside, North Yorkshire. \u00a3140,000. Illingworth-Wood, 01751 431107 . What? A tatty sliver of cottage. Condition Barely habitable. There's no kitchen to speak of, a sorry scrap of a bathroom and, with one bedroom and one reception room, it's minute. Anything over \u00a350,000 would assist its recovery. Why you should A vanished neighbour has left a handy plot of land alongside and the council has agreed outline planning permission for an extension to arise from the mud. For an extra \u00a316,000, you could acquire a double garage. Why you shouldn't The garage, if you buy it, is several doors down the terrace. Take three: mews homes 1 Coleherne Mews, SW10 What you get One reception room, four bedrooms, three bath/shower rooms. Pros It must be said that Victorian horses enjoyed a happy standard of living: wooden floors, ceiling spotlights and designer hygiene all in a dinky cobbled hideaway off the Old Brompton Road. Cons It only just manages those four bedrooms - one is 5ft 3in wide. Banquets must be mustered in a galley kitchen. There's no garden. Price \u00a31.1m, Aylesford International, 020-7351 2383. 2 Grenehurst Park, Capel, Surrey What you get One reception room, cloakroom, two bedrooms, two bath/shower rooms. Pros You may be squeezed into the servants' quarters, but you get to squire it in the estate grounds, communal pool, sauna, gym and tennis court. The living room overlooks your own chunk of garden. Cons Flights from nearby Gatwick disturb the time-warp. The A24 is between you and the village shops. Price \u00a3425,000, Patrick Gardner &amp; Co, 01306 877775. 3 Regency Mews, The Exchange, Tunbridge Wells What you get One reception room, kitchen/dining room, cloakroom, three bedrooms, two bath/shower rooms. Pros In a past life the site was a telephone exchange. But \"mews\" is a label that seduces developers, so let the fantasy live on. It's a brief walk to shopping mall and station. The interiors are chic. Cons It's still a building site. There's an uphill slog home from the train.
