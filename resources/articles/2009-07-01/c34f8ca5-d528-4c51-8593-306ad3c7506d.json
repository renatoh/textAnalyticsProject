By tea, we had hurtled back to the 1930s, when Australia posted apocalyptically big totals against England and Don Bradman was unassailable. Only three times have England conceded more runs to the old foe than the 674 for six declared they haemorrhaged over 12 hours and 24 minutes here in the heart of Wales. The Bradman generation struck 695 at The Oval in 1930, 701 at the same ground in 1934 and 729 for six declared at Lord's in 1930. In the most recent of those batterings, Bradman helped himself to 244 and Gubby Allen went for 170. Players love to pretend history is just a GCSE but the scale of Australia's assault with bat and then ball will haunt Andrew Strauss's men until summer's end. Nice venue, this, until it changed into a house of pain. Marcus North (who he, we all said?) and Brad Haddin, heir to the great Adam Gilchrist, became Australia's third and fourth centurions of the innings before Alastair Cook and Ravi Bopara were cut down short of tea to leave England 20 for two and in more muck than a Gloucestershire Old Spot. Until the pace and ferocity of Australia's surge picked up once the middle-order had taken the visitors past 600, this Test was floating by like a rowboat on the Taff. What a miserable deceit. Hollywood has made nautical disaster flicks from less than the tempest that suddenly enveloped England's laboured efforts to stay in the match. Except that water saved them, sort of. Rain, which was meant to come for lunch, turned up for tea instead. Ricky Ponting can even outsmart the met office. The longueurs of Wednesday to Friday seemed to be leading us to a gentler kind of inquest. Why was the Cardiff pitch so dead? How can there have been so few passages of real mano a mano spark? Were two evenly matched sides going to grapple artlessly like this all summer? But then the Australians made their move to remind us how violently one side can seize the initiative while the other gropes for its gumshield. The symbolic declaration of Australian superiority was Haddin's six off Graeme Swann over midwicket to bring up the 600. Craning his neck to watch it go was Stuart Broad, who has endured such a torrid time with the ball. You felt the air move, the mood change, as Australia's batting acquired a sadistic edge. It was bread of heaven for Haddin and North. They were free to load on the agony and play their shots. Each blow took Ponting's men closer to the run avalanches of the 1930s and increased the stress on England's batsmen, who knew they were going to have to go back to work chasing an Australian lead of 200-plus. It took three and a half days for England to become a cornered animal in this Test. Haddin smacked Monty Panesar straight down the ground for six. At 648 for five, as the wicketkeeper was about to become the fourth batter to post three figures (England, ominously, had none), an Anglo-Welsh crowd launched into God Save the Queen, or it might have been God Save our Team. Sheer anxiety seemed to open their vocal chords. Or maybe it was self-deprecation: the bird of doom that all struggling sides must dread. Haddin's celebration as he passed 100 was lusty. He was raising his bat almost as the ball pinged off it and he bounced off the wicket like a liberated prisoner. North wrapped him in a hug. Several of these Australians came to England doubted or even downright denigrated. All bar Mike Hussey, and arguably Phillip Hughes, has looked the part. This is another problem for England. If North is a middle-order centurion and Nathan Hauritz a wicket-taker, England's search for weak links to hack at is going to consume many late nights. For a moment it seemed Australia's record Test innings of 758 against West Indies in 1955 might be under threat, but Ponting summoned his men off with a lead of 239, and Strauss and Cook padded up with all the joie de vivre, one imagines, of two men being asked to paint the Severn Bridge with cotton buds. Cook managed 12 balls before falling lbw to Mitchell Johnson and Bopara was gone in three, playing across the line of a ball that would have cleared the bails. Rum luck, but the stroke invited the mishap, just as England's failure to steer a batsman past 69 (Kevin Pietersen) in their first innings opened the door for Ponting to deliver a seminar in first Test strategy. So let's count England's gains so far. Er, Paul Collingwood \u2013 a batsman who was their most efficient bowler \u2013 and Matt Prior's batting. Beyond that, England must survive three sessions with two wickets already down, and then work out why Andrew Flintoff's flourish with the ball was so brief, how Pietersen can be reprogrammed not to chuck his wicket away, why Strauss failed to apply consistent pressure with his bowling line-ups and field placings and whether Graham Onions and Steve Harmison should return at Lord's. If Harmison is the answer, you always worry about the question, but he would not be the first top cricketer to alternate between maestro and liability. Lord's, in 2005, is fingered like a charm. England lost there and came bounding back to win the series against a better Australian side than this one. But in those days they had Flintoff, Harmison, Matthew Hoggard and Simon Jones swinging like a jazz quartet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
