The decision follows a special general meeting of the local branch in Beaconsfield on Friday. The former attorney general lost a confidence vote by 182 votes to 131 in March. He remains an MP, but if his application for readoption is rejected he may face challenges from other candidates for the seat. In a statement posted on Twitter, the Beaconsfield constituency Conservative Association chairman, Jackson Ng, said: \u201cI understand that there are feelings of disappointment, anger and frustration from many of our membership. \u201cTherefore, following this evening\u2019s special general meeting and on behalf of our executive council, I have immediately written to our MP, Dominic Grieve QC, to formally request that he now submits a written application to us to seek his readoption as our parliamentary candidate for the next general election expected in 2022.\u201d Should Grieve apply, his case will be decided in a secret ballot of members of the local executive. One local party member, Dylan Kenny, said on Twitter: \u201cIt was heartening that everyone spoke respectfully and with dignity. Dominic made an impassioned and highly intelligent speech. I am glad there was no animosity and the association should be proud of the conduct of this evening\u2019s discourse.\u201d Grieve has long been the symbol of the internal battle within the Tory party over Brexit. He has previously called for a second referendum and has campaigned against leaving the EU without a deal. He was an outspoken critic of Theresa May\u2019s handling of the Brexit negotiations and told the party in March that he had never felt more ashamed to be a Conservative. After losing the local confidence vote in March, he said he was then subject of \u201can orchestrated and organised campaign\u201d by Brexiters to deselect him. The push for his deselection has been led by the former Ukip candidate Jon Conway, whom the Conservatives recruited after serving as a regional organiser for Vote Leave. The justice secretary, David Gauke, is also facing a no-confidence vote over his Brexit stance. A notice has been sent out saying a special general meeting of his South West Hertfordshire Conservative Association will take place on 28 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
