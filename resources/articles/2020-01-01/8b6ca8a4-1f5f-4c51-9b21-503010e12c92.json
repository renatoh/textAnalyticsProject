Lekoil had already revealed the $184m (\u00a3142m) loan agreement to its investors earlier this month, when representatives from the Qatari fund approached the oil minnow over the weekend to question \u201cthe validity\u201d of the deal. Shares in the Nigeria-based company were immediately pulled from the London\u2019s junior Aim market while lawyers from Lekoil sought to find the \u201cfull facts of this matter\u201d. Lekoil paid an initial arrangement fee of $600,000 to Seawave Invest, which is registered in the Bahamas, for introducing Lekoil\u2019s advisers to individuals \u201cpurporting to be from the QIA\u201d to discuss the loan. Lekoil said it \u201cwill be contacting the relevant authorities across a number of jurisdictions without delay\u201d to report \u201cwhat appears to be an attempt to defraud\u201d the company. A spokeswoman for Seawave did not respond to a request for comment. Lekoil will set up an investigation committee spearheaded by its new non-executive directors Mark Simmonds, a former minister in David Cameron\u2019s government, and Tony Hawkins, the chief executive of Columbus Energy Resources, who joined Lekoil\u2019s board just days after the loan was agreed. \u201cWhile Lekoil will take all reasonable actions to recover the fees paid to Seawave, there can be no guarantee that such attempts will be successful,\u201d the company added. The total loan fees, payable to Seawave and the QIA, were expected to reach almost $10m, leaving just over $173m within the loan facility to fund Lekoil\u2019s plans for an oil exploration campaign at the Oga field off the Nigerian coast, where it owns a 40% stake alongside Optimum Petroleum, a local Nigerian firm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
