In its new format, launched today, it will do even more. As the editor, Alan Rusbridger, says elsewhere in today's paper: \"Because we don't have a proprietor or shareholders our main relationship is with the readers.\" The Scott Trust, to whom I am answerable as readers' editor or independent ombudsman, is in fact the unconventional owner of both the Guardian and the Observer. It gives the papers a unique freedom. This special structure has enabled the Guardian to make the present radical changes in an astonishingly quick time. The editor reiterated in briefings last week that there will be no loss of editorial quality. The trust, since my appointment in 1997, has strongly supported the principle that underlies the role of readers' editor - that a newspaper such as the Guardian, which by definition calls on others to be accountable for what they do, should also be accountable for its own journalistic activities. More than 10,000 of you write to me in the course of a year, producing more than than 1,500 entries in the daily corrections and clarifications column. It is an effective form of self-regulation, reducing litigation and probably also complaints to the Press Complaints Commission. A great many readers have come to see it as a positive expression of their relationship with their paper. This interaction should be enhanced by various new features in the Berliner. Access to the digital edition, normally available only on subscription, is free for the next two weeks so that readers worldwide can see what the new design looks like, page by page. The Guardian's network of websites, Guardian Unlimited, attracts 600,000 unique users (separate individuals) every day. From tomorrow there will be a new Response column which will run from Tuesdays to Fridays on the letters page of the paper - in the spot occupied today and on Mondays in future, by my column. The Response column will provide, primarily for those who actually figure in the news, an opportunity to reply to a report or review at greater length (about 500 words) than the letters page would normally allow - a chance to speak from a more conspicuous place in the forum. A temporary innovation on the website will be an editors' blog, giving the editor, his section editors and others (including me) an opportunity to keep you in touch with the inner workings of the paper and the reasoning behind some of its decisions during the period of acclimatisation. With this step into the future the paper is not forgetting its past and the values of which it is the custodian and which have made the Guardian what it is. The advent of the Berliner coincides with an exhibition, Hidden History, in the Newsroom, the Guardian archive and visitor centre which faces the main newspaper building across Farringdon Road. The exhibition lays out a selection of the material relating to the histories of the Guardian, the Observer and Guardian Unlimited, gathered during the short time since the archive was opened in June 2002 (www.theguardian.com/newsroom gives a brief account). One of the items on view is a note from an assistant editor, Michael McNay, dated July 12 1987, to David Hillman, the designer responsible for the radical design introduced in 1988, which survived up to Saturday. The question was, should the paper retain its familiar masthead - the title across the top of the front page? The note from McNay to Hillman says: \"The editor [Peter Preston] tells me that if we are having a root-and-branch redesign, he's happy to see it go.\" Preston grasped the nettle then. Rusbridger has done so this time, bidding a final goodbye to Hillman's influential title combining Garamond italic and Helvetica. You could not not do that. Today's change is a wholehearted step into the future. To what extent it succeeds, you will judge. I shall be here in the middle. \u00b7 Ian Mayes is the president of the Organisation of News Ombudsmen. reader@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
