Members of parliament who wish to retain their seats \u2013 and the party leaders who compete with them for the title of Purest of Them All \u2013 have no choice but to kiss the lash. The mood of the country allows nothing else. It is the price that the honest and hard-working majority have to pay for the excesses of their colleagues who exploited the system in a way which was part scandal and part farce. But that does not require the pretence that all the new proposals are either right or reasonable. They are a response to the populist clamour that the exposure of previous excesses \u2013 right and necessary though it was \u2013 created. Some of Kelly's recommendations have intrinsic merit. It is clearly wrong for a member of parliament to acquire a second property with a mortgage subsidised by the taxpayer. The prohibition of that practice confirms the arbitrary nature of rules which govern Sir Thomas Legg's retrospective revision of what it was acceptable for MPs to charge in previous years. David Cameron received \u00a31,750 a month to defray the interest on the house he bought in his constituency \u2013 the bigger the house, the bigger the mortgage and the bigger the taxpayers' subsidy. Sir Thomas requires that only \u00a3237 in total be repaid. Who can object that, in future, Mr Cameron will have to make do with his own resources? However, some of Kelly's proposals are less easy to justify. During my 30 years in the Commons \u2013 when expenses increased from literally nothing to inadequate secretarial and constituency accommodation allowances \u2013 I never even considered employing a member of my family. Nor did any of my close friends. But to prohibit the practice is absurd. By all means introduce a system that requires MPs to prove that the employment is genuine and the employee properly qualified. But where is the possible justification \u2013 to take one from many possible examples \u2013 in prohibiting the formidable Lady Campbell from running Sir Ming's Edinburgh office? The answer, craven at best, is that the prohibition is a response to popular demand. That \u2013 not issues of personal hardship or legal obligation \u2013 is the overwhelming argument against the idea. MPs are entitled to resent the implication that they all subscribe to the standards exhibited by Derek Conway. Kelly's reputation for clear and objective thinking is not enhanced by recommendations based on the supposition that they do. The new scheme should be a rational system of moderate reimbursement, not an exercise in the appeasement of populist prejudice. There is no doubt that the body politic needed an emetic and that \u2013 the logic of its recommendations aside \u2013 the Kelly report, combined with the revelations which made it necessary, will provide one. But in the short term the result can only be an increase in the conviction that politicians cannot be trusted and that draconian regulation is the only way to keep them honest. That is a penalty with which the present generation of MPs must live in the hope that their successors will benefit from the belief that Kelly's purgative has lanced the political boil. In the meantime we have to consider the effect of the whole process on British democracy \u2013 a far more important consideration than the propriety of charging for gardening in a constituency home or even investing, at public expense, in a duck house. The reputation of parliament could not have been protected from the damage that the expenses scandal has caused. Attempts to hide the details would have been as futile as they would have been wrong. But it is important to understand that the revelations were not made \u2013 nor have they been repeated \u2013 for motives entirely devoted to achieving political purity. The notion that MPs are crooks sells newspapers. And if, for the first three days of the sorry story, the crooks are all Labour, the result is a clear balance of advantage to the Conservative party. Sir Christopher will recommend what he thinks right. But he needs to remember that the pressures upon him are not exclusively from the heirs to William Ewart Gladstone, who burn a postage stamp if, by mistake, they use an official envelope for private correspondence. No doubt Alan Duncan was right to say that reduced income and increased scrutiny will limit the flow of thrusting young candidates for parliament. In one way that is a pity. In another, it may well be the one good thing to come out of the whole ghastly saga. The crisis of confidence in politics and politicians is not the result of Douglas Hogg claiming parliamentary expenses for cleaning out his moat. It is the product of politicians failing to debate the merits of a society in which one family lives in a moated grange while another survives in a bed and breakfast hostel. If it becomes only possible to become an MP by making material sacrifices, there will be more conviction politicians. It is because the House of Commons has increasingly become a career, rather than a vocation, that a proportion (a small proportion) of members behave like bankers in search of a bonus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
