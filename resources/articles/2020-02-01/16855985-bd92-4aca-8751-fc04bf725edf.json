Eddie Jones lashed out after his side\u2019s scrappy 13-6 win, accusing Scotland supporters of lacking respect after England\u2019s head of performance, Neil Craig, was hit shortly after getting off the team bus at Murrayfield. Scotland supporters were also seen making obscene hand gestures at the England squad. Jones, who was also deeply unimpressed by the crowd\u2019s repeated booing of Owen Farrell as he kicked at goal, said: \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting beer bottles to be thrown. It\u2019s a pretty good achievement, throwing beer bottles, you\u2019ve got to be brave to throw a beer bottle.\u201d The Scottish Rugby Union said it had apologised to England\u2019s team manager, Richard Hill, and cast doubt on whether the bottle had been thrown. The SRU pointed to new footage that it believed suggested the bottle had been blown towards Craig rather than thrown. The Guardian understands that the Six Nations was in discussions on Sunday with both unions over the incident. England triumphed in a scrappy, weather-affected game thanks to Ellis Genge\u2019s second-half try. When it was put to Genge that a Scotland supporter had thrown the bottle which struck Craig, he said: \u201cHe\u2019s old, man. He\u2019s like 93. You can\u2019t throw a bottle at an old man. If someone did that to my grandad, I\u2019d lose my mind. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t see it. That\u2019s out of order. I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone. I\u2019m happy he\u2019s OK. Meanwhile the Rugby Football Union moved to deny reports in South Africa linking Rassie Erasmus with replacing Eddie Jones as England\u2019s head coach. Since the Springboks\u2019 World Cup triumph in Japan Erasmus has moved upstairs at the South African union, acting as director of rugby while Jacques Nienaber has taken over as head coach. Erasmus was at Murrayfield on Saturday but on Sunday the RFU\u2019s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, strongly denied the suggestion that Erasmus has been in discussions over replacing Jones, whose contract expires in 2021. The day after the World Cup final Sweeney said that it \u201cmade sense\u201d for Jones to extend his contract through to the 2023 tournament. Sweeney and Jones have since held talks over a contract extension but no deal has been agreed. Sweeney was adamant, however, that there has been no contact with Erasmus. \u201cThe reports are 100% inaccurate,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been no meeting. There have been no talks whatsoever about any position at the RFU.\u201d England\u2019s victory over Scotland kept alive their hopes of winning the Six Nations title with Ireland due at Twickenham on 23 February after the tournament\u2019s first fallow weekend. England flew home on Saturday night to avoid the full impact of Storm Ciara that caused severe travel disruption throughout the country. England Women\u2019s match against Scotland has been rescheduled for Monday afternoon and will now take place behind closed doors at Murrayfield. The match was initially scheduled for Sunday at Scotstoun Stadium in Glasgow but was postponed due to the extreme weather. The Six Nations said: \u201cWeather conditions in Edinburgh on Monday will not be as severe as Glasgow but still forecast as challenging, so the game will not be open to the public or have tickets on sale.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
