The president said he hoped prime minister Boris Johnson, a \u201cwonderful guy\u201d, and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage would come together on a united political platform. The president spoke to reporters at the White House after returning from a visit to New York to watch a UFC fight, an evening which produced both boos and cheers and stoked fierce debate on Sunday. Asked which British politician he would side with if he had to choose, Trump said: \u201cI like them both \u2026 So I think Boris will get it right. They\u2019re both friends of mine. What I\u2019d like to see is for Nigel and Boris to come together. I think that\u2019s a possibility.\u201d Farage said on Sunday he would not run for a seat in the general election. Johnson has already rejected the suggestion from both Trump and Farage that he should work with the Brexit party. Instead, Johnson has talked up the prospect of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US as one of the biggest prizes of leaving the European Union. Trump said: \u201cBoris is the right man for the time. He\u2019s really for the times. He\u2019s a great gentleman. He\u2019s a wonderful guy. He\u2019s tough, he\u2019s smart and I think he\u2019s going to do something.\u201d Speaking to Farage on the British politician\u2019s LBC radio show earlier this week, Trump said Johnson\u2019s proposed Brexit deal would prevent the UK and US from striking a trade deal of their own and described the situation as \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d. Downing Street rejected that claim. On Sunday, Trump indicated that if the UK made a clean break with Europe, as opposed to remaining in the customs union in any form, the US would be in a better position to strike a trade deal. \u201cWe\u2019re far and away the No1 economy in the world,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand, if you do it a certain way, we\u2019re prohibited from trading with the UK. That would be very bad for the UK because we can do much more business than the European Union.\u201d In his broadcast conversation with Farage on Thursday, Trump also disparaged the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. In response, Corbyn tweeted: \u201cDonald Trump is trying to interfere in Britain\u2019s election to get his friend Boris Johnson elected.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
