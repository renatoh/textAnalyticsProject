When I say it\u2019s their Gold Cup, it really is. They\u2019d rather have a Badger winner than a Gold Cup in some ways. Of Present Man, she said: \u201cHe\u2019s magnificent to sit on. He holds himself proud and his jumping is just phenomenal when he\u2019s out there. He\u2019s an exceptional athlete.\u201d Frost and Present Man were fancied to complete a hat-trick in last year\u2019s race but pulled up when out of contention with two fences to jump. He returned to winning on his first start since, however, landing a handicap at Chepstow by the narrowest of margins at the beginning of Octoberlast month. \u201cIt was an old warriors\u2019 battle down the straight at Chepstow and luckily he\u2019s got an extra-long neck with a few whiskers on the end of his nose to get me a picture taken. That was a brilliant way to start and it\u2019s great to have his confidence high. He\u2019s got a lot of weight but the best horse carries the most weight and he\u2019s a very big, impressive horse.\u201d In the three years since Present Man\u2019s first win at Wincanton, Frost has ridden out her claim, landed the conditional jockeys\u2019 championship in 2018-19 and taken two Grade One chases, including a memorable win on Frodon in the Ryanair Chase at the Cheltenham Festival last year. The same horse supplied her latest big-race win, under top weight in a valuable handicap chase at Cheltenham two weekends ago, a performance that could earn him a place in the field for the Gold Cup in March. \u201cThe Gold Cup is furious with its speed, it\u2019s constant from flagfall to post,\u201d Frost said, \u201cbut he lives for his jumping and makes time in the air without any effort, and his fluency and accuracy is one of his keys. He loves to attack his fences and there\u2019s always a fence he\u2019ll take half a stride out and catch you out, and you land smiling. \u201cHe\u2019s a horse that makes you really enjoy life and forget about anything that\u2019s happening off that track. You feel very lucky to be out there with him.\u201d GW Friday\u2019s best bets The ex-Irish conditional Kevin Brogan had a low strike-rate in his native land but has caught fire here in the past week, riding four winners from nine rides, albeit two short-priced chances for Gordon Elliott at Sedgefield yesterday did not work out well. Two of his winners were for Jonjo O\u2019Neill and he gets the legup today on the trainer\u2019s Write It Down (2.45), a young chaser with more to offer at Warwick. This one won here last autumn when young Jonjo was still able to claim. Soft ground has been a problem for him on a couple of occasions since then and Huntingdon didn\u2019t work out last time, when he was ridden to get the three miles and never got into the argument. This step back in trip must be good news and he is fairly priced at 7-2. The market has had a good slurp at Sorbet (1.35), down to 11-4 favourite for her handicap hurdle. She bumped into one when second here last month and the third has won since. The Dan Skelton yard is whizzing along, having been slower than I expected to get going in the early autumn. A few of his horses may be able to improve on their reappearance efforts, including Accordingtogino (2.10), who undermined his chance on Lingfield soft by racing too keenly. He appears to be attracting support at 11-2. Anthony Honeyball could have a double at Fontwell to follow up his Ascot treble from the weekend. He runs Windance (12.50) and Gustavian (3.10). Windance is available at 7-1 but I\u2019m not sure anything from that yard is a 7-1 shot just now, including this son of Shirocco making his hurdles debut. Finally, look out for Tom \u201cFrankel\u201d Queally making his chasing debut on one of Gary Moore\u2019s in the 2.35pm race. I\u2019d bet against him but let\u2019s hope he, and everyone else, comes back in one piece. CC"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
