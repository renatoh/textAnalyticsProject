Admittedly, there are only three runners in today\u2019s Classic from stables other than his own but they are trained by titans of the Irish turf, Dermot Weld, Jim Bolger and Kevin Prendergast, all of whom were doing the job by the time young Aidan was seven years old. Between them, those grandees have accumulated 146 years with a licence, during which time they have surely learned all there is to know about preparing a talented young racehorse for the big occasion. We must hope they haven\u2019t forgotten much of it, because the participation of their horses is the only thing stopping this Derby from esembling an exercise gallop at Ballydoyle. Prendergast, a week shy of his 87th birthday, has the most obvious chance of foiling O\u2019Brien. Four weeks ago at Epsom, his Madhmoon defied doubts about his stamina to be a close second in the Derby and now he is just a 5-2 shot to give Prendergast a first success in a race his father, Paddy, won four times. \u201cIt would be the crowning glory on all the races I\u2019ve won, over the years,\u201d Prendergast reflected on Friday at his Friarstown Stables, about two miles from The Curragh racecourse. It is 42 years since he successfully raided Newmarket, sending over the 20-1 shot Nebbiolo to shock the locals in the 2,000 Guineas. Only a fool could have underestimated him since that day and Madhmoon\u2019s career suggests his powers have not waned one bit. To win today, his colt must turn around the form with O\u2019Brien\u2019s Anthony Van Dyck, who may have been on a faster strip of ground at Epsom after switching to the far rail in the closing stages. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a hard horse to beat again,\u201d muses Prendergast, who is not inclined to complain about the way the Derby panned out. \u201cIt\u2019s only half a length. If my horse improves a length, he wins the race! That\u2019s if he races the same as he did at Epsom, and we\u2019re hopeful that he will. \u201cIt was a tactical sort of race but I don\u2019t think there were too many hard luck stories. It was pretty clean. Look, whichever one has the best luck this time will probably win.\u201d At least there have been no bumps in the road in the intervening month. Indeed, Chris Hayes, Madhmoon\u2019s jockey, is evidently bubbling over with hope, telling a reporter on Friday: \u201cAs crazy as it sounds, I think he\u2019s improved.\u201d The more phlegmatic Prendergast will not go quite that far. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t be better. He\u2019s only done bits of pace work and a couple of swingers. He\u2019s very fit and in good shape. I hope we get the nod this time.\u201d Weld\u2019s Rakan has rather more to prove, though the two horses he beat last time both ran well at Royal Ascot recently. \u201cI expect him to run a good race,\u201d Weld said of the 20-1 shot. Bolger could be accused of an excess of optimism in running Guaranteed, if there was anyone brave enough to say such a thing anywhere near him. Available at 66-1, the horse scrambled home in a much lower grade last time but he is improving and his trainer has evidently held him in high esteem for some time. \u201cWe\u2019re just hoping the step up to a mile and a half will bring out a bit more in him,\u201d said Kevin Manning, rider of Guaranteed and son in law to Bolger. Tellingly, he added: \u201cI loved the way Kevin\u2019s horse went to the line at Epsom and I think whatever beats him will win.\u201d O\u2019Brien fields five runners but there is no doubt his preferred outcome is for Anthony Van Dyck to become a dual Derby winner and popular stallion prospect. At least this time the master trainer doesn\u2019t have to worry about his son, Joseph, whose Latrobe won last year\u2019s Irish Derby. O\u2019Brien Jr lacks a runner this time but he still has much to celebrate, having saddled Iridessa to win Friday night\u2019s Group One, the Pretty Polly. O\u2019Brien Sr had to make do with the placed horses, Magic Wand and the one-paced Pink Dogwood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
