So earnestly is the 13-time champion preparing that we eschewed a conventional seated interview in favour of a brisk walk up an down the oche \u2014 defeat for 'The Power' this year would mean three years without a world title, the longest barren spell since he won his first back in 1990. But neither will Taylor be thwarted by a lack of confidence. \"I'm ready for the world championships, I'm up for it. I've got plenty of time now to finally tweak things up a little bit so I shouldn't really lose it this year, to be honest, I should be in with a shout,\" he says, launching three more darts. Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! So, does Taylor really believe the title is his to lose and not someone else's to win? \"It could be this year. I shouldn't really be losing it, I'm playing probably at the best I've played for a long, long time. So I shouldn't be losing. I've done well this year, I've won almost everything, apart from Bolton I've won every tournament so I should be okay.\" Thirteen titles in 17 years affords Taylor a level of confidence that for others would be deemed arrogant, but elimination at the quarter-final stage at the hands of Wayne Mardle last year has had an effect, and his desire to toss the tungsten rather than sit for a 10-minute interview betrays his bravado. \"I know I can win it, I've done it before. It's just a matter now of getting everything out of the way, do all your jobs you've got to deal with and just get stuck in now.\" Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! Last year the PDC world championships were held in Alexandra Palace for the first time Did the move away from Taylor's veritable fortress, the Circus Tavern, effect his performance? \"Ally Pally? Yeah, it's different. It's big and the stage was massive last year, that was a big difference for us, but it's not going to bother us this year,\" he said. \"It was weird last year, but I don't think it's going to bother anybody this year because we've played at so many big venues this last year, so it won't bother us at all now.\" Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! Debutant Steve Grubb has drawn Taylor in the first round; what does The Power know of him? \"I haven't played him myself,\" says Taylor. \" Obviously he's a good player because he's qualified. There's no idiots in the world championships.\" Thunk, thunk, thunk. \"Steve's going to try his best and that means two things; he's either going to play out of his skin, which people normally do against me, or he's going to play rubbish. I think he's going to play out of his skin, so I'm going to be ready for him.\" Who does Phil fancy to win, should he lose? \"I think Barney [Raymond Barneveld] is always in for a shout, I think young James [Wade] could do quite well. As an outsider I'd say Andy Hamilton will probably do well this year. But other than that I can't see anyone else winning it.\" One last throw for emphasis. Phil certainly has the power of positive thinking. And thunking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
