They are not allowed to tell you. That's the point of Bilderberg. It's behind closed doors and out of bounds to everyone but other power brokers. A rave for masters of the universe. Lord Mandelson was there, Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, Ying Fu, China's vice-minister of foreign affairs, Thomas Enders, the CEO of Airbus. Also in attendance was the chancellor, George Osborne, who got to swan around in a big black limo, pressing flesh and broking power. And though we cannot know what he said, or what was said to him, we know that his flight alone to Switzerland cost us \u00a3414, because he has just made a quarterly disclosure via the Treasury. Next year, easyJet. With Pepsi and nibbles, \u00a3150. \u2022 The New Year looms and still no deal between the government and public-sector unions. Hardly surprising. It must be difficult for Francis Maude to think about the pension he is offering them and his own without a little sniggering. And he has more than the promise of numerous \"gold-plated\" pensions. For our supersleuth David Hencke finds that Maude also has rental properties, the occupants of which tend to be ambitious young Tories. The Maude madrasa, we learn, usually consists of activists, special advisers and wannabe MPs. Outsiders might dilute the mix and, without them, those of like mind can swap secrets and deface pictures of Labour Ed without fear of dissent or betrayal. Maude's the go-to guy for the PM, hero to Tory types who need somewhere to kip. \u2022 One of those who spent time in the Maude madrasa, we see, was the Australian strategist James McGrath, whose years since have been punctuated by difficulty. He it was who advised black Londoners perturbed at the ascendency of Boris Johnson that they should leave the country if they didn't like it. And who hit trouble in Australia the other day, when officials were caught compiling a \"dirt file\", including the sexual peccadilloes of political opponents? Yes, 'twas he. \u2022 But, then, conservative types get everywhere and they do seem to be in the ascendency. Even sports coverage seems to have been infected by illiberalism. You turn on TalkSport, hoping to hear what the rugby players have been up to, or if Man Utd might catch City, and what do you hear instead? Richard Keys, Andy Gray and Alan Brazil discussing the particular delights of Norway. \"They've got it right,\" says Brazil. \"They don't let the foreigners in. That is why they have got it right. Top place.\" Yes, they \"keep themselves to themselves\", observes Gray. \"Yes, what's wrong with that?\" Brazil asks. \"Norway for the Norwegians.\" Up next? The premiership with Nick Griffin. \u2022 Europe's getting a bad press at the moment. But, regardless, our people are in Brussels, working hard for you. Such as Sir Graham Watson, MEP for the south-west of England, who was this week forced to challenge the idiocy of the European Food Safety Authority. After some deliberation, it has dismissed the laxative effect of prunes. \"That can't be right,\" Watson told the hearing. \"Scientifically, it just can't be. But most of our constituents do not require a scientific test, so I am asking you, Mr vice-president, if you would on our behalf challenge commissioner Dalli to a prune-eating contest so that he can see for himself?\" Alas, the vice-president ducked out. \"I don't think we need to go into competition over this,\" he said, moving quickly along. \"Thank you.\" \u2022 Finally, things have changed at the BBC and not for the better. The cuts, the political attacks, none of it good for morale? Yesterday we revealed how staff at Newsnight, where life was always lived to the full and on the edge, were offered 200 free \"ethical condoms\", sourced in the Amazon by the reporter and \"Ethical Man\", Justin Rowlatt. And yet, we learn that only two or three colleagues have had the time or the inclination to take advantage. Work, sleep, work, sleep, fret, stress. Nothing is as it used to be. I blame Lord Hutton. A sorry state of affairs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
