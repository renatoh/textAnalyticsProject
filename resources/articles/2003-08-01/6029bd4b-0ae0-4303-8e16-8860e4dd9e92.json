And yesterday the 27-year-old, who paid \u00a350 for his coiffure in Leighton Buzzard, stung like a bee to take the Nordic Open title from under Colin Montgomerie's nose. Montgomerie, after following a 65 with a Saturday 64, looked odds-on to secure his first European Tour title for nine months and his 28th in total. But it was Poulter, after the fifth victory of his four-year Tour career, who last night flew out to the US PGA Championship at Oakhill, New York, wearing the bigger smile. He shot 66 for a 22-under- par 266 to edge out the 40-year-old Scot by a single stroke after the seven-times European No1 had to settle for a par five at the last and a 68. Victory, worth \u00a3187,000, lifted the player from Milton Keynes into fifth place in the European money list with more than \u00a3715,000. A crowd of more than 15,000 turned up in the hope of cheering their local favourite Soren Hansen to victory in this first Tour event on Danish soil but he ended in a tie for third on 268 after a 69 alongside Scotland's Stephen Gallacher, who had two eagles in a homeward 30 for a 63, and the Frenchman Gregory Havret, who finished with a 68. The woman who approached Poulter in an Italian restaurant on Saturday night to tell him she had 1,000 kroner - about \u00a3100 - on him to win at odds of 22-1 must have been chewing her fingernails during a cliff-hanging finish. Montgomerie chipped to five feet for a birdie four at the 17th and needed another at the last to force the eighth play-off of his career, seven of which, incidentally, he has lost, the other being declared a tie with Bernhard Langer in last year's Volvo Masters. He watched Poulter open the door by fluffing a chance of a birdie at the 18th but then pushed his second high into the crowd and failed from 15 feet for his four. Poulter, who followed victory in the Celtic Manor Wales Open in June with second place a week later in the British Masters, caught Montgomerie with an outward 32 and added three birdies coming home, downing a 20-footer at the 15th. It was another triumph for European golf's new breed, and Poulter's brash approach to the royal and ancient game is refreshing. Last year he sported a red and white hairdo in support of Arsenal and he says: \"I just think there are too many golfers who look the same week in, week out. It's nice to do something drastic to throw a bit of colour into the game and give everyone a laugh but I was pleased to let my golf speak for me here.\" He heads off to the United States in confident mood: \"Over the next few years I'll have many opportunities over there. My target is to get into the top 50 in the world rankings by the end of the year [he was 76th a week ago]. \"That would probably give me seven or eight tournaments around the majors. The ranking points each week and the money is bigger over there. \"It was frustrating yesterday not to birdie the last two holes, then to do it again today, but I'm going to America with massive self-belief. The rough will be thicker and the fairways tighter but, if I keep hitting them and holing some putts I can do very well.\" Montgomerie, back after three weeks out of action because of the wrist injury that forced his retirement from the Open after seven holes, was not too despondent. \"I predicted 22 under par would be the winning score and I needed two birdies in the last three holes,\" he said. \"I made one but shooting 65, 64 and 68 in the last three rounds gives me a lot of confidence to take into the next two weeks.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
