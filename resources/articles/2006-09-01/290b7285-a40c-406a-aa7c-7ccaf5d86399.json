It had been set alight and the decomposing remains were badly charred, but around her neck there remained a tightly looped ligature, made from a pair of tights, still deeply embedded in her flesh. Over the days that followed, further details emerged of the circumstances surrounding her death. The remains had been stored in an empty flat for 11 days before being moved to a box in a storage facility on the A270 near Brighton. Video evidence showed that her killer, Graham Coutts, visited the corpse nine times in the next three weeks. When police raided the facility they found Ms Longhurst's mobile phone, a pair of her knickers and a condom bearing traces of both his DNA and hers. Coutts, it transpired, was the partner of a woman whom Ms Longhurst considered a friend; the dead woman had recently got back in touch with the couple to congratulate them, having learned they were expecting twins through IVF. These are details of such grotesque and appalling horror that one wonders how those who loved Jane Longhurst have ever been able, having heard them, to carry on with their lives. Yet this week her family are celebrating, in a way, though they have had to mine assiduously to find their trace of comfort. Coutts was found guilty in February 2004 of murdering Ms Longhurst after the court heard he had long harboured a fascination for websites depicting scenes of extreme sexual violence, including asphyxiation, rape and murder. In July, the law lords referred the conviction back to the court of appeal after ruling that the jury should have been offered the option of convicting him of manslaughter (he claimed she died accidentally during consensual sex). But while Coutts remains in custody facing a likely retrial, Jane's mother, Liz Longhurst, and sister, Sue Barnett, have continued to campaign against such violent sites, collecting tens of thousands of signatures and lobbying ministers. This week, the Home Office announced plans to make it an offence meriting three years in prison to download violent internet pornography - in response to Longhurst's initiative. It's the culmination of more than two years' intense work for the family. \"It's a great help,\" says Mrs Longhurst, \"because it's all part of the therapy. And I feel that if the law does get passed, it's a wonderful legacy for Jane.\" Liz Longhurst still lives in the neat Reading red-brick house which she and her husband, Bill, bought in 1961, the year after they married. Over a period of 45 years, one senses, the crowded family home has witnessed its share of small domestic joys but also, perhaps, more sorrows than many. Jane's father died in 2000 after a long period of dementia. \"I lost Bill long before that,\" says Mrs Longhurst. \"They kept giving him treatments to keep him alive, but I really felt it was kinder, in the end, just to let him go.\" It may be the deep reserves of the long-term carer, perhaps the stoicism of someone who has for many years lived alongside sadness, but she is able to display a striking grace and equanimity when talking of her lot. \"Of course, it's very sad. But that's the way life is, I'm afraid. Anybody who says, as they sometimes do, 'Oh, life's not fair,' I say to them, 'Well, who says life should be fair?' It's isn't! It isn't fair! You just have to make the best of what you've got, haven't you? Don't you think?\" It must be very difficult for someone who has lived through what she has to take such a position, I suggest. \"I think if I bear resentment, bear grudges, he's won. I'm not having him winning. Remember that.\" Liz was 40 and her husband 58 when Jane was born, eight years after her sister. Her mother calls her a \"late blessing\", and it is clear she absolutely doted on her younger daughter. She recalls with fondness and in great detail the school exams Jane took as a teenager, the piano scales she refused to practise, the marks she attained in flute and violin and piano recitals. She walks me around the house, pointing out family snapshots in clipframes of two young sisters looking strikingly different. Jane looks up with big eyes from beneath a pudding-bowl haircut, often serious, seeming younger than her years. Her mother is aware of the way that time sanctifies those who lose their lives tragically, and yet, since Jane died, Liz says, those marginal figures who have re-emerged from Jane's childhood suggest that she was indeed a little bit special. Her infant-school teacher was one of the first to lay flowers in the drive of the family home when the identity of the body was confirmed; the man who made her beloved viola travelled halfway across Britain to attend her memorial service at Liverpool university; a longtime male friend, a devout Catholic, prays for Jane's soul every day. \"Well as far as I'm concerned, he can do no wrong! I think that's wonderful.\" Mrs Longhurst herself has always had a strong faith, she says, and the killing has affected it not a bit. \"People say to me, 'Hasn't this made a difference to what you believe?' And I've said, 'No, not in the slightest.' Why should it? And if you take the long view, which I do, think about how we're damned lucky to be living here at all. Think about all those terrible massacres in Rwanda. All those terrible things that go on. OK, it's been horrid; it's been horrible. But I've been very blessed with loving family and loving friends.\" Her own childhood, curiously melancholy, although she says her parents were loving, may have made her this way, she thinks. \"In a way, I almost think that before all this happened, I had cried myself out, really.\" She first knew for sure that the broken body was Jane's when she was listening through headphones to a late-night radio broadcast; the police would not formally confirm the identity until the following day. She really doesn't mind having found out that way, she says, having known in her heart that Jane was already dead. The inane chatter of the early-morning DJs was actually a comfort as she lay awake. The following morning, Easter Sunday, she got up and went to church as usual. The establishment of a ban on violent porn is by no means assured as yet. First, it must be passed by parliament, where, as Mrs Longhurst notes, \"the libertarian lobby is very, very strong.\" She accepts that the websites Coutts viewed - more than 800 pornographic images were found on his computer, the large majority of them violent - did not create his predilection or directly cause her daughter to be killed, but she argues that what \"the internet gives is some kind of legitimacy\" to those who find sexual gratification in such images. The fact that the Jane Longhurst campaign attracted 50,000 signatures of support made her feel, she says, \"like a million dollars\". \"I imagine there will be a law passed but it's not going to be as easy as passing a law on child pornography, because you can always say the children couldn't give their agreement,\" she says. \"Well, my feeling is that a lot of the women who are used in these horrible videos, maybe some of them have agreed to do it, but there are going to be others, the trafficked women, who have not agreed to it. \"It's very horrible. I won't look at the stuff, because I think it could be seriously corrupting. But if you want to look at them now, you're not breaking any law whatsoever.\" I ask how she has managed to persevere with a mundane, suburban, non-despairing life, knowing the details as she does of what the trial judge called \"the unbelievable degradation\" of her daughter's body. \"Well, I have always felt this, and I still feel it now, that once ... once she was dead, she was dead. And so whatever he did to her body, he couldn't touch her beautiful soul. Put that in your pipe and smoke it! As they say.\" She gives a short, sad giggle. \"Really, it's the only way.\" She tells of a friend who called one day, in great distress about Jane, \"and I thought, 'Well, I just can't take this really.' I remember I said to her, and I still say this now if people get upset: '[With] Jane, unfortunately, that's that. But I think of her like a beautiful enclosed crystal, a beautiful person. It's just that she can't develop any more.' \"I said to her, 'You ought to think along those lines. Think about that'.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
