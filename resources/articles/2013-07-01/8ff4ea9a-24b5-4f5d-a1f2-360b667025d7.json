Its vibe is intimate conversation with an unlikely man, Alec Baldwin. Unlike his TV persona as Jack Donaghy on 30 Rock, the self-described dilettante is an intelligent interviewer with a voice that mesmerises. He creates an environment for his guests \u2013 musicians, authors, politicians, executives, actors and others \u2013 that allows them to make confessions, such as Billy Joel forgetting how to read music. He ignited Debbie Reynolds' ball-of-fire personality, and created a stage for Martin Horn, the former New York City commissioner of correction and probation, to shed a different light on the prison industry. \u2022 Tune in at wnyc.org/shows/heresthething Good Job, Brain! Hosted by Karen, Colin, Dana and Chris. The great thing about being truck drivers is the trivia we pick up in our travels; which makes this the perfect show for a road warrior. The hour begins with random questions from Trivial Pursuit. It's amazing what I can absorb in a 10-hour driving shift, and the show that included castoreum (Google it!) still has me reeling. It has a weekly theme and seems to have a thing for mnemonics. For example, if you need to remember the countries of Central America, try this: Baby Godzilla Eats Hotdogs, Not Cocoa Puffs (Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama). \u2022 Tune in at goodjobbrain.com America's Test Kitchen I've learned more about food from this podcast than what three generations of family cooking experience have handed down to me. When I first saw host Christopher Kimball on public television, I didn't think he looked like a guy who'd know anything about food. I was wrong. And now, that bow-tied, bespectacled guy is the person who causes me to leave myself voice memos while driving, to follow up on later. Product testing, recipes, wine experts, interviews and phone-in questions answered by Kimball and Bridget Lancaster fill the hour. \u2022 Tune in at americastestkitchen.com/radio Real Time with Bill Maher, HBO Bill Maher is smart, funny, opinionated, and fully utilises his right to free speech. He's the antidote to scripted network news. As the host of a show that's predominantly political, he serves up the latest happenings in his uncensored style. I'm entertained by interviews with authors, film-makers, journalists, executives, activists and more. There's always a one-on-one with a special guest, a panel discussion, and Maher's \"New Rules\" segment. Conversations are laced with information and humour, and, oddly, not as much in-fighting as you'd expect. Or, as I'd like. \u2022 Tune in at hbo.com/real-time-with-bill-maher The Splendid Table, American Public Media The tagline is \"the radio show for people who love to eat\". Endless information about food, culture and people who live happily with culinary obsession. I'm one of those people. I learned how to preserve lemons Moroccan style, and listened as the author of Extra Virginity, Tom Mueller, opened my eyes to the scandalous world of olive oil. Roadfood's Jane and Michael Stern do all the legwork on the best places in the country to eat, and in October 2012 I even called in with my own question about Muscadine grapes I found on my travels. I needed help, and the host, Lynne Rossetto Kasper, knew exactly what to do. \u2022 Tune in at splendidtable.org A Way With Words I pick up something new with every episode, and am still trying to figure out how to work \"happy as if someone were throwing pork at you\" into conversation. A \"lively public radio show about words, language, and how we use them\" is how this show is described, and its hosts \u2013 Martha Barnette, an author, and Grant Barrett, a lexicographer \u2013 brilliantly cover everything to do with language: slang, colloquialisms, grammar, word debates, style and usage, dialects and even archaisms. \u2022 Tune in at waywordradio.org The Accidental Creative Today's world has an insatiable appetite for new stuff. For people whose work hinges on regularly being creative, coming up with new ideas to pump out fresh material can be daunting. We need ways to stimulate our brains to help us maximise our effectiveness in all areas of our lives. The Accidental Creative is like a 30-minute brainstorming session with the best of the best. One of my favourite podcasts was a recent one, where author Josh Kaufman explained how to quasi-master a new skill in just 20 hours. I'm on it! \u2022 Tune in at accidentalcreative.com Car Talk I couldn't fix a car if my life depended on it, but this show's presenters Tom and Ray Magliozzi make me think it's possible. Usually, when an mechanic speaks, you have tears in your eyes thinking of repair costs; these guys are the funniest mechanics on the planet and the only tears I shed come from laughing hard. Not many mechanics are Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) educated, as these brothers brothers Tom and Ray Magliozzi are, and they use their brilliance, humour and classic Italian sibling ribbing to keep you entertained for an hour. It's unlike any show I've heard, and I'm completely hooked. \u2022 Tune in at cartalk.com Book Review, The New York Times Each week this podcast brings me the scoop on the literary world. Interviews with authors and editors, critics' opinions of new books, Times' staffers sharing their favourite reads, and news about bestsellers. I love the podcast because it's like a friend telling me about the latest and greatest happenings. Listening to an author talk about the story behind their book gives that story added depth. It introduces me to books I'm not aware of, or subjects I may not have considered reading about. \u2022 Tune in at itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/book-review ItalianPod101.com I'm sure people think I'm crazy when they see me talking to myself as I drive. Imagine what they'd think if they knew I was doing it in Italian? Listen to native speakers conducting conversations, and imagine yourself sipping un doppio cappuccino at a cafe in Piazza Navona. After you've ordered in Italian, of course! Go at your own pace, pick subjects or phrases you need to know for an upcoming trip or for a conversation with a friend, and repeat lessons as often as necessary. \u2022 Tune in at italianpod101.com Salena Lettera is the author of the Daily Rant at salenalettera.com \u2022 For more information on holidays in the USA, visit DiscoverAmerica.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
