A demographically representative sample of the population will then be selected from those who respond, with 110 people taking part in the Climate Assembly UK over four weekends in Birmingham next year. Participants will be asked to discuss how the UK should respond to the climate emergency and what policies they would like to see implemented to meet the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, now enshrined in law. We want to hear from people who have received an invitation to take part about their views on participating. Share your experiences We are interested in hearing from people who have received an invitation to take part in Climate Assembly UK. Are you pleased?
