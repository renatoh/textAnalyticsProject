I knew in the pit of my stomach I wanted to come here,\" said Rafael Ben\u00edtez's \u00a317m capture from Portsmouth. However, there was also a common enemy who united the England defender and the Liverpool manager: Jose Mourinho. It is no surprise Johnson and Ben\u00edtez struck an immediate rapport given the grievances they both hold against the former Chelsea and now Internazionale manager. It is a surprise they found time to discuss anything else. But while Mourinho is gone and professionally forgotten as far as the Spaniard is concerned, his influence lingers and arguably still haunts the 24-year-old. Johnson faced the media for the first time as a Liverpool player yesterday, and a barrage of questions about having a second chance to prove himself among \"the big boys\". According to the full-back, however, the first chance never materialised. \"It was working out for me at Chelsea until Mourinho turned up,\" argued Johnson, the first signing of the Roman Abramovich era when he moved for \u00a36m from West Ham United in 2003. \"Mourinho had his own plans and wanted to bring in his own players and that's when it started to go downhill for me. I just needed to play but I wasn't given that chance and I didn't really get an explanation from Mourinho either. If you play one game in every four or five then it is impossible to get any form or anything running so I said I wanted to leave.\" Ben\u00edtez's decision to invest \u00a317m in the right-back, when the budget is limited at Liverpool, confirms he shares that opinion. If Gareth Barry is the main aggravation in Benitez's summer so far, although there was no \"if\" about it when the Liverpool manager accused the Manchester City signing of avarice yesterday, then Johnson is his antidote. An established England international who opted for Anfield, despite interest from City and the offer of a better salary to return to Stamford Bridge, meets Ben\u00edtez's requirements for \"fine-tuning\" this summer. The fact Johnson never sat on the sidelines counting his money at Chelsea or allowed Mourinho's opinion to send his career off course also appealed to the Liverpool manager. \"We knew we had to pay good money because he had good offers,\" admitted Ben\u00edtez. \"But his desire to be successful here was very important. We don't normally spend big money on defenders but he is a really important player, an offensive defender and an England player. We needed quality, someone with something more to stop the draws we had last season, another player to go forward and be a threat from the back. That was important.\" The arrival of Johnson, who becomes the most expensive defender in Liverpool's history, complements Ben\u00edtez's success in keeping his existing squad together. Dirk Kuyt, Fernando Torres, Daniel Agger and Yossi Benayoun had already signed new deals this summer and yesterday Steven Gerrard joined them, signing up for the next four years. \"It's really good to keep Kuyt, Torres, Agger, Benayoun and Steven. They are the here and now of the club and for the future it is really good,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"We have a lot of good players who want to stay, to win and compete. The message has to be the same again this year \u2013 to be there, to be contenders and to fight. If we can win trophies it would be fantastic.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
