It went unnoticed at the time. But for Mr Livingstone's opponents, fuming still at the international \"oil for brooms\" deal he signed this week with Hugo Chavez, of Venezuela, and smarting over his claim that the mayoralty is as much about international diplomacy as municipal stewardship, it should now be taken as a sign that things are only going to get worse. The Guardian has learned that officials at City Hall, central London, have begun \"scoping\" work on the prospects for international cooperation between the capital and Brazil. Mr Livingstone's team are concentrating in the short term on relations with China, India and Russia as well as on the nuts and bolts of the deal with Venezuela. But Brazil has also been identified as another rising force with which London must make common cause. \"Lula thinks London is a very important place and we are looking closely at the situation there,\" a source said. \"It may be four or five years down the road but Brazil has many things going for it. It is a major manufacturer of cars and steel. It is also the biggest producer of ethanol, which will be a key commodity in the fight against climate change.\" London considers itself well placed to provide municipal consultancy. \"If you went to one of the big consultancy firms and said 'let's rebuild a city' the cost would be colossal. We have over 100 years experience of running a successful city,\" the source said. Unveiling his Venezuela deal this week, the mayor trumpeted the benefits for 250,000 poor Londoners, who will get half-priced bus and tram travel using the \u00a316m saving via the receipt of cheap oil from Hugo Chavez. But Mr Livingstone also said the deal was part of a strategy and wider philosophy. \"We will work with cities right the way across the world. People see themselves as partners on one planet and we either save the world together or die together.\" He said the notion particularly applied to the response to climate change. Mr Livingstone believes that for a city like London international diplomacy by the mayor is a matter of necessity. Next week, he plays host to the mayors of Paris, Moscow, Berlin and Beijing. The leaders of other devolved administrations also venture further afield. Last year Rhodri Morgan, the Welsh first minister, went to China, Dubai, Brittany, Brussels and Latvia. Jack McConnell, Scotland's first minister, took six foreign trips between April 2005 and 2006, including Canada, Australia, Malawi, China and Belgium. London's mayor has been abroad 20 times since 2004, on visits including tips to Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, Singapore, and Moscow. Last year he famously tried to visit President Chavez in Caracas but returned home because the Venezuelan leader could not see him. London has \"embassies\" in Brussels, Beijing and Shanghai with offices in Mumbai and New Delhi due to open in November, all of which the mayor claims are cost effective. \"We don't have a foreign policy,\" a source said. \"We have a domestic policy that requires us to have these international links.\" But Mr Livingstone's macro approach to the job of municipal leadership is controversial and the Venezuela deal has particularly infuriated his critics. Hours after the accord was signed, the London Assembly announced an investigation. Members have also been forcing his administration to justify the travel bill. The policy also carries the risk of guilt by association, particularly for a mayor who so guards his political reputation. The mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, is a political ally but the mayor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, who signed a partnership agreement with Mr Livingstone, is seen by some as a rightwing nationalist. President Chavez is also both loved and loathed. Referring to his relations with Venezuela's media, this week's Economist magazine accused the president of \"silencing dissenting views little by little\". Angie Bray, Tory leader at City Hall, said the international links required scrutiny. \"I can see the logic of deals with major cities but what has happened with Venezuela is basically the politics of the pirate. What next? Cheap rice from Cambodia? Cheap cigars from Havana? In any event, I am not sure people in London would think the mayor and his team run our services so efficiently that they have time to run them anywhere else.\" She added: \"He wasn't elected to have a foreign policy. He has very specific areas of responsibility.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
