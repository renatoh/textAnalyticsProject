That is why nearly two-thirds of Americans think the war was not worth fighting. Similarly, the costs of remaining in Iraq indefinitely and in large numbers also outweighs the potential benefits. Therefore, the US should begin a phased and responsible strategic redeployment of its forces and undertake a diplomatic surge immediately. The 150,000 US troops and all essential, sensitive and costly equipment can be withdrawn safely over a 10 to 12 month period. During this period, the military should not replace outgoing troops as they finish their tours and draw down force and equipment levels at a pace similar to that of the spring of 2004 when nearly 235,000 soldiers and their equipment were rotated safely in and out of Iraq in a matter of months. But the US should not leave the region entirely. To protect its interests it should leave one brigade in the Kurdish region and another brigade and a tactical air wing in Kuwait. This force should be backed up by a carrier battle group and a Marine expeditionary force in the Persian Gulf. After the US makes it clear that it is leaving, it should initiate a regional security and diplomatic effort to contain Iraq's multiple conflicts. Countries in the region should be receptive because none of them, including Iran, wants to see Iraq become a failed state. If nothing else, a failed state in Iraq would create millions of more Iraqi refugees flooding into their countries. Nor would any of them, especially Iran - a Persian, Shia nation - want Iraq to become a launching pad for al-Qaida - a Sunni Arab group. In fact, this is why the Iranians cooperated with the US in its war to remove al-Qaida from Afghanistan in 2001.
