With three days to go until their opening match against Cameroon, an exhausted and demoralised squad could not have wished for a more debilitating climax to the saga of their exiled captain. Yesterday was marked by further confusion, recrimination and fevered, if unfounded rumours of a last-minute apology from Keane to appease the manager Mick McCarthy and bring the finest Irish footballer of his generation back to the fold. Having first released a statement that publicly backed McCarthy's decision to send Keane home, the 22 remaining players then performed a remarkable about-turn last night and insisted they wanted the captain to return. But McCarthy, under pressure from his squad and the Football Association of Ireland and growing hostility from the Irish public, decided Keane's show of emotion during a television interview on Monday night did not constitute the public apology he had demanded after the outburst at a players' meeting on Thursday that led to Keane flying home. Having repeatedly threatened to quit if he felt the FAI was challenging his authority, McCarthy was angry that, against his wishes, his employer had been negotiating with Keane's advisers. It also emerged that the striker Niall Quinn, backed by his team-mates and without his manager's knowledge, had instigated talks about Keane rejoining the squad. McCarthy was clearly unhappy at a heated press conference yesterday which was curtailed by the FAI's general secretary Brendan Menton after the manager fired a few more verbal shots at Keane, claiming the 30-year-old had a history of \"picking and choosing [international] games\" and \"missing friendlies\". McCarthy was also unimpressed that, in the early hours here this morning, discussions were continuing between FAI officials, Keane and his solicitor Michael Kennedy. \"Should these negotiations really be going on? If I wanted to apologise to someone I would pick up the phone and do it. No consultations would be needed. That hasn't been the case here, and I'm disappointed by that,\" he said. \"There was a lot of talk an apology was going to be made in this television interview but when I saw the full transcript there was no apology in there.\" McCarthy called a team meeting at 10.30am yesterday in which he told the players he would not accept Keane back as matters stood. Believing he would quit if they did not support him, they released a statement that \"regrettably, the manner of Roy's behaviour prior to his departure in Saipan and the comments attributed to him since have left the staff and players in no doubt the interests of the squad are better served without his presence\". Yet Quinn later said everyone in the squad had agreed they wanted Keane reinstated. \"We're all shattered he's not here,\" he said. \"We issued that statement with heavy hearts.\" The Sunderland player revealed that on Sunday morning he had phoned Kennedy, the London-based solicitor who also represents Quinn. Sir Alex Ferguson has also played a behind-the-scenes role. \"Michael Kennedy is probably the best negotiator I have ever come across,\" said Quinn. \"I rang him because I wanted to find a way of getting Roy back out here. \"I also went to Mick because I felt there was an opportunity Roy might be asked back. I have been pestering Mick behind the scenes but, away from that, he didn't know I was working to get Roy back. \"Mick was annoyed with me. But I make no apologies. I brought up the people back in Ireland, but I also said I had done it for him, that I was trying to protect him and I didn't want him to lose out.\" No matter how the FAI has tried to shelter the players from the public reaction at home, the sympathy heaped on Keane since Monday's television interview, in which he revealed he wanted to rejoin the squad, is filtering through. More than 2,000 people signed an internet petition yesterday to have him re- instated, and 93% of respondents to a television poll took his side. \"Sort it out, you morons,\" said a banner outside the FAI's offices in Dublin's Merrion Square. Only three days before the biggest game of his six years as Ireland's manager, McCarthy is now being widely depicted as the villain. His status was described in one newspaper as \"lower than a snake's belly\", though perhaps the fact that last night's final act in the drama was instigated by Keane will result in a degree of exoneration. The timing of the affair could hardly be more excruciating. \"This thing has got long fingers - it's touched everyone back home. It's touched me, my family, and it's certainly not made our World Cup any easier,\" McCarthy said last night. \"The players can't take any more,\" added Quinn. \"We have to get back to thinking about football, but it's not easy. I'm just glad we're not playing Cameroon tomorrow.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
