The team\u2019s failure led to the immediate and \u201cirrevocable\u201d resignations of both the manager and the president of the Italian federation, Giancarlo Abete. Prandelli said: \u201cWhen a professional project fails, it is right to take the responsibility.\u201d Neither offer has so far been taken up. He said he and the FIGC\u2019s chief had for four years \u201ccamouflaged well the problems of Italian football\u201d and he complained about allegations of financial impropriety that had been levelled at them. But Prandelli added: \u201cIf I make a professional mistake, that is a different matter and I assume all responsibility.\u201d Corriere dello Sport reminded readers that it was the first time in 48 years that Italy had failed in successive World Cups to get beyond the initial round. Within minutes of the final whistle, Prandelli told a TV interviewer: \u201cThe sending off of Marchisio left a mark on the game and our World Cup. It is absurd to be left with 10 players in a match like this. There weren\u2019t such bad fouls \u2013 you can\u2019t condition a game as important as this in that way.\u201d But when asked about a possible resignation, he replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll see now.\u201d Reactions on social media ranged from the furious to the witty by way of the fatalistically cynical. \u201cUnbelievable! Ball boy turns referee [and] expels Italy from World Cup\u201d raged @FrankMo_. For @BeppeBergonzi, tweeting in English, \u201cThe \u2018Biter\u2019 team won\u201d. Earlier when the Mexican referee, Marco Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Moreno, showed Marchisio a red card, @nicoperdire had posted a tweet that said: \u201cReferee\u2019s wife confirms: he\u2019s a cuckold.\u201d Italian fans had feared the worst when they learned of the official\u2019s surname. Another Moreno \u2013 Byron Moreno \u2013 was bitterly accused of tipping the scales against Italy in the national side\u2019s encounter with South Korea during the 2002 World Cup. Nor did it inspire confidence that the Mexican who oversaw night\u2019s decider had the nickname in his own country of \u201clittle Dracula\u201d \u2013 an allusion to his resemblance to a character in a popular TV show. To top it all when not handing out red cards to Italians he is a Protestant pastor. But if @gennaromontana was angry it was at the performance of a lacklustre Italian side. \u201cWhat a disgrace,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThere are no excuses. Full stop.\u201d @Sweetkisskaty thought \u201cWe only played with spirit at the end.\u201d Others were inclined to be more charitable. @maurizioft asked: \u201cIf Costa Rica and Uruguay get through and Italy and England go home, there has to be a reason. No?\u201d By way of explanation he attached a hashtag that referred to the Brazilian climate. Such considerations cut little ice with professional reporters, however. Maurizio Crosetti writing for the website of the Italian daily, La Repubblica, said: \u201cThe sending off of Marchisio after an hour was excessive. That foul was worth at most a warning. But before and after (and in the \u2018before\u2019 let\u2019s include the game against Costa Rica) Prandelli\u2019s side didn\u2019t put together a thing.\u201d Il Giornale, the family newspaper of Silvio Berlusconi, Italy\u2019s former prime minister and the owner of Milan, struck a similar note. \u201cThere were a few mistakes on the part of the referee \u2013 the excessively severe removal of Marchisio and [his failure to send off] Su\u00e1rez. But the Azzurri did almost nothing. And they have reaped what they sowed,\u201d wrote Piero Minotti."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
