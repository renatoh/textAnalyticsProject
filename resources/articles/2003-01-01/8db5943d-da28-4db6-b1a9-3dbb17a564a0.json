You can reclaim VAT of 14% at the airport on purchases that are exported from the country. You should obtain a leaflet at the airport or from a tourist shop when arriving, which states exactly what must be on each invoice (you need to adhere to this). On departure, show the VAT officials all the items that you have purchased along with the invoices.
