And it\u2019s the first time a Guardian writer has got a mention in an acceptance speech. Thank you for following along \u2013 here are your Brits winners for 2019. British male: George Ezra British female: Jorja Smith British single: Calvin Harris &amp; Dua Lipa \u2013 One Kiss British breakthrough: Tom Walker British group: The 1975 British video: Little Mix \u2013 Woman Like Me (feat Nicki Minaj) International group: The Carters International male: Drake International female: Ariana Grande British album: The 1975 \u2013 A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships British producer: Calvin Harris Critics\u2019 choice: Sam Fender Global success award: Ed Sheeran Outstanding contribution to music: Pink She may be heading towards her Radio 2 years, but Pink\u2019s image \u2013 bourbon-slurping tattoo artist ready to give Karen at the other end of the bar a piece of her mind \u2013 still makes her stand out in the pop landscape. In fact, she\u2019s an object lesson in how to be a major label, Brits-friendly artist: doggedly weather the early days, when the label has no idea how to package you up, shrug off the inevitable flop records, keep singing songs that empower people out of the sweatpants phase of a breakup, and never forget the importance of Germany as a secondary market. Starting in her dressing gown in her dressing room \u2013 very much part of her #relatable image \u2013 she kicks off with Walk Me Home and is swiftly hoisted into a costume that looks like Big Bird in the climactic scene of Carrie. Up she goes into the heavens, with the flamethrowers from Kanye\u2019s 2015 performance earning back some of their value for Just Like Fire \u2013 a highlight of late-period Pink, thanks to its vocal leaps as vertiginous as her drop to the arena floor. Then it\u2019s into Just Give Me Reason, in some ways her most melodically satisfying song; Nate Ruess\u2019s part is done (very capably) by Dan from Bastille in the most quintessentially Brit awards moment of this year\u2019s Brit awards. The medley klaxon has been well and truly sounded. Another recent Brits cliche \u2013 projection mapping \u2013 is deployed for an upbeat take on Try before a change into a newsprint-covered mac for What About Us. It remains an utterly shameless ripoff of Coldplay\u2019s Sky Full of Stars, but remains just as cheesily satisfying. She and her dancers finish by holding lights in a gesture of solidarity for \u2026 what? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter. Sometimes pop just needs to be uplifting. The Bros brothers were among the best-received presenters from the crowd at the Brit awards. And it\u2019s no surprise: their documentary for the BBC, After the Screaming Stops, was a huge Christmas hit. Matt Goss told me: \u201cThe fact it went viral is extraordinary. I think we broke a lot of the BBC records as well. The overwhelming response is that it\u2019s being emotive and connective experience. People have been coming up to me in the street talking about their family, their work, and their loss. The documentary transcended music.\u201d When asked what it was like to be thrown back into the spotlight, Goss said it was a misconception that he was ever really out of it. \u201cFame doesn\u2019t suddenly go away. In the last five days, I did two shows \u2026\u201d When I was faced between the choice of getting a more professional photo for the liveblog or a selfie, I obviously went for the selfie. Pink\u2019s nomination (announced before the awards) felt a bit, \u201cHuh, okay\u201d \u2013 but her legacy, while quiet, is more considerable than you\u2019d think. When she arrived in 2000, she pulled the curtain back on pop\u2019s machinations (\u201cLA told me you\u2019ll be a pop star / All you have to change is everything you are\u201d), brought grit to a squeaky-clean scene by confronting serious issues through her music and setting out a template of partying on her own terms that would influence much of mid-00s pop. Her Janis Joplin-worthy rasp and tornado-strong vocal power added gravitas to her towering hits, and her own identity as a straight-talking, zero-BS woman learning to deal with life as it comes has never wavered. I\u2019d put money on Pink being the reason that a lot of the young women in this room wanted to be pop stars in the first place. (Adele has said as much in the past.) \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to her music my whole life,\u201d Dua Lipa told Jack Whitehall earlier. It\u2019s 16 years since she was last here, she says. \u201cI bet it\u2019s hard for some of you to believe as well, but to be considered in the same category as David Bowie and the Beatles and Sir Elton and Sir Paul and Eurythmics and Fleetwood Mac \u2013 it\u2019s beyond anything my brain can comprehend \u2026 It\u2019s been an awesome journey from busking on the street to playing Dingwalls, to playing Wembley this summer \u2026 It\u2019s been an awesome 20 years. Here\u2019s to 20 more!\u201d The 1975 now, fronted by Matty Healy, a pigeon-toed manifestation of the anxieties facing rock stars today. There\u2019s the existential stuff we\u2019re all going through \u2013 twisted politics, the death of the planet \u2013 plus some rather more particular anxieties, like how it\u2019s simultaneously quite problematic and quite exciting to have women throw themselves into your DMs. And there\u2019s some old chestnuts too, like how nice heroin is. Performing Sincerity is Scary dressed in a woolly hat and headphones over his tuxedo in front of some huge New York brownstones, a la the video, the band smoothly play out the laidback, Chance the Rapper-indebted track. I was kind of hoping for a ferocious state-of-the-nation performance of Love It If We Made It, but I can\u2019t be mad at someone who shouts out our brilliant deputy music editor Laura in an acceptance speech \u2013 and with a statement of real political importance. Khalid was two years old when Pink released her debut album. Another shocker for George Ezra, who \u2013 by his colossal commercial success, at least \u2013 looked set to sweep the night. But the right act won: there\u2019s probably more ambition and diversity in the 1975\u2019s third album than there is across the rest of the night\u2019s nominees combined. Heroin love songs! Weird Siri lullabies! A trop-house banger that somehow managed to revive pop\u2019s most tired micro-genre and make it irresistible again. Obviously I am biased now but give them all the prizes. This time around Matty Healy thanks their manager, his girlfriend (\u201cThank you for letting me write all that stuff down\u201d) and the Arctic Monkeys \u201cfor still being such an inspiring and relevant band in 2019 \u2013 I know how hard that is\u201d. Err didn\u2019t anyone tell Jared that the Greatest Showman bit was at the start of the show? Indeed \u2013 an admirable lack of mid-Atlantic blurring of his Dumfries tones. And while we\u2019re here for reaction gifs we can get behind: Or at least Jack Whitehall\u2019s best attempt at starting some. He plonks himself in the middle of Little Mix\u2019s table to try and get them talking about Piers Morgan, who \u2013 precious snowflake \u2013 managed to agitate himself into a great frothing frenzy over nothing a couple of months back. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like that picture where you stripped off naked \u2026 voluptuous chest and four chins, it must have been like looking in the mirror for him.\u201d Little Mix aren\u2019t ready to go there publicly. \u201cJACK!\u201d Jesy yells. \u201cJesy, what would you say to that dutty wasteman?\u201d Nothing on live TV, it turns out. Another worthy winner! Brits, are you sure you\u2019re feeling okay? One Kiss is *chef\u2019s kiss*, switching snappily between Dua\u2019s inviting, warm-shore verses and the hall-of-mirrors heatwave vibe of the chorus. It is, however, wild that this is Calvin Harris\u2019s first ever win for British single when he\u2019s helmed so many smashes over the past decade. Justice for Feels, his Katy Perry/Pharrell duet. I might defer to actual woman Laura Snapes to ascertain how far this performance has pushed global feminism forward, but I would hazard not very much. In a Dove campaign come to life, Jess Glynne, US R&amp;B star HER and 70 women (including Jess\u2019s mum) all take their makeup off as she performs her song Thursday. According to Jess in a press release we got beforehand, this is \u201ca gesture to remind ourselves and everyone else that it\u2019s okay and we are enough as we are. I hope this moment can help enforce that no woman is alone\u201d. It is enormously well-meaning, and gestures of sisterhood like this \u2013 on a very public stage \u2013 are laudable, even culture-jamming. It certainly beats the staging for your average piano ballad; Jess is in perfect voice, and HER adds a gorgeously improvisatory take on verse two. But just as Dove\u2019s campaigns, beyond their championing of diverse body types, still quietly trade off female insecurity and a valorisation of beauty above all else, this act ends up feeling trite when set amid a night that announces beauty actually IS about glamour and makeup. Point is, if this makes you feel better about yourself as a woman, you\u2019re sitting on a bar that society loves to keep really, really low. ARE THEY RE-ENACTING YOKO ONO\u2019S CUT PIECE? No? Oh. It\u2019s a performance of Glynne\u2019s single Thursday, ie: \u201cI won\u2019t wear makeup on Thursdays.\u201d Babe, it\u2019s Wednesday. I give it two minutes before I get a press release from the microfibre makeup removing cloth they\u2019re all using. (Tbf I have one and it\u2019s very good and environmentally friendly!) So #touching. Calvin Harris recently had his 26th Top 10 single, which puts him joint 11th in singles chart history \u2013 an accolade he shares with Rod Stewart. That is quite a lot of whopping hits, which begs the question of why it\u2019s taken so long for the Brits to actually give him any awards. Let\u2019s get the conspiracy theories going: he once looked at Brits boss Geoff Ellis for too long at the urinals? He is viscerally anti-Britannia and can\u2019t bear the thought of touching the statue? The voting body think he\u2019s cheating because his Scottish heritage is largely overshadowed on his songs by the presence of gigantic US stars? Taylor Swift has orchestrated some sort of elaborate blackmail? Whatever dark forces were at work here have abated, and Harris has his first Brit. And here he is: \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here for a few years and I\u2019ve never got the opportunity to say anything on this stage before\u2026\u201d thank you etc. No woman has ever won this award, and only two have ever been nominated for it \u2013 Kate Bush and Goldfrapp \u2013 which makes for an interesting contrast with Annie Mac\u2019s preamble about how nice it is \u201cto be at a Brits where as many females are nominated as males\u201d. A better shot of that Meghan portrait. Is that some Queen Victoria styling? What does it mean, aside from the fact that she is a queen? How will the Daily Mail report this? How many Guardian commenters will lose it over us mentioning Beyonc\u00e9 again? Questions\u2026 THE OBVIOUS AND WORTHY WINNERS! There\u2019s proper girl-band-ery afoot in this superbly weird video \u2013 dancing atop buses, acting fecklessly in a quasi-academic environment, writhing around on chairs \u2013 and I am here for it. I still have questions about Jesy\u2019s lip liner though. Like, why is there so much of it? A lot of enjoyable high-pitched wailing in their acceptance speech, delivered by Jade Thirlwell: \u201cWe never win this! Oh my god, thank you so much! We have had absolutely no shame in asking people every day to vote for this.\u201d Medley! The Brits were born for medleys. We kick off with Giant, which to be honest is one of Calvin\u2019s weaker moments: Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone saying \u201cI am\u201d over and over again like a malfunctioning mindfulness app does not a chorus make, and the brass is like an abortive Rudimental studio session heard through a partition wall. But this is a pretty robust rendition, with Harris twisting knobs amid banks of (presumably redunant) analogue synths and generic electronic gear. It segues into Promises, with Sam Smith dressed like a mirrorball being sent through a black hole. Whoever keeps breaking up with him and sending him into boozy nights out full of self-loathing and loneliness, please keep doing it \u2013 it\u2019s resulting in some great pop songs (see also Dancing With a Stranger). But it doesn\u2019t seem to faze him: singing ever so slightly flat, he\u2019s joined by Winnie Harlow for some Saturday Night Fever-style dance moves and generally fabulous sashaying. Finally Dua Lipa, ever a fan of a high short, stalks her way around some shrubberies as if lost in the Ibizan hillsides for her performance of One Kiss: the soundtrack to flirty eye contact over a 5pm mojito in Alicante. Altogether it\u2019s a very strong showcase for the Scottish producer\u2019s pop touch. Can we take a minute to hail him? Slide, Blame, We Found Love, Ready For the Weekend, his Spectrum remix, This Is What We Came For and potential Brits winner One Kiss are all in the absolute top tier of pop this country has ever produced. And, Shawn Mendes aside, his underwear advertising remains #goals. If anyone is particularly enjoying the work of breakdancer Jai Hickling, you can see him performing again at Nuneaton\u2019s first ever breakdancing festival, at the Griff and Coton Sports club on 9 March. And gives the most boilerplate, phoned-in acceptance speech of all time. \u201cMeans a lot \u2026 can\u2019t be there \u2026\u201d Snooze. None of them have shown up, but they have sent actual thank-you messages! That\u2019s unexpected. From Ariana Grande (international female) and Drake (international male) but not least from Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, winners of best international group as the Carters, who thank the UK for always being supportive. \u201cEverything is love, thank you,\u201d says Beyonc\u00e9, standing next to Jay-Z in front of a portrait of Meghan Markle \u2013 in what one could interpret as a show of support for the duchess, who has been the subject of vitriolic treatment at the hands of the tabloids. Jorja Smith goes from backing up Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man at last year\u2019s awards to getting a slot of her own, and you could make a reasonable case for the Brits helping to nurture her path towards the big time. But then they would, wouldn\u2019t they, given she is distributed by The Orchard, who are owned by Sony, who have been managing the last three years of the Brits. But because of her commanding choruses and charisma, she deserves the industry whirring away beneath her \u2013 even if her taste for vocal fry is on a par with a particularly disgruntled Los Angeleno tween. Don\u2019t Watch Me Cry is the Britsiest choice she could have made for the Brits: piano breakup ballads have of course, per Adele, made for some of the most memorable moments in recent Brits history. Aside from a rogue whoop, the audience is pin-drop quiet for Smith\u2019s commanding performance, though truth be told, she is better at lower-key, bruised performing than this classic vocal showboating \u2013 it would be so much radical to get her to do something like Blue Lights, a claustrophobic crime story, on stage here. But as a bit of palate-cleansing after the bombast of the first few performances, it works perfectly. Little Mix\u2019s electrifying performance has Emma Bunton, and many others, up on their feet and applauding. Respect from girlband to girlband. Little Mix, whose spat with Piers Morgan has clearly sent them into weaponised frenzy of sass, sit like a coven around a table before discarding their pink PVC coats for a marauding take on Woman Like Me. They\u2019re joined by Ms Banks \u2013 who we championed back at the start of 2018 and is standing in for Nicki Minaj; the US rapper co-signed Banks\u2019 magnificent guest verse on Stylo G\u2019s Yu Zimme, in which she announces her intention to absolutely rinse the assets of her boyfriend, ie a very Little Mix kind of energy. Banks crushes her self-penned verse, bragging of her \u201chips from my mama and attitude from my daddy\u201d, and Little Mix also deliver: all throaty hollers, saucy gyrations and tongue flicks, plus a bombastic martial energy in a glitching, exploding arrangement. Their knackered cardio breathing is audible at the end of the mic: they gave everything, and are rightfully Britain\u2019s best girl band in a generation. Shame they didn\u2019t win best group in a way \u2013 but judging by the fan energy on socials, the public-voted video award will be theirs. A confession: I knew absolutely nothing about Tom Walker until this week my job dictated that I had to know something about Tom Walker. Here\u2019s what I guessed in advance: bad hat. Outsized beard. Big voice. Tender-hearted yet beefy ballads, maybe tarted up with a little au courant synth work. A bit Jack Garratt. A bit Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man, a bit Lloyds TSB advert soundtrack, a bit \u201curban\u201d. Secular bombast, that kind of froggy voice you get when you haven\u2019t quite swallowed your tea properly. READERS, GUESS WHAT. Sadly this is less testament to my brilliant telepathy than it is the utterly predictable shape of Britain\u2019s male pop stars. Anyway, here he is (\u201cYes gran, here we are!\u201d). Obviously this is a much worse acceptance speech than the last one because it doesn\u2019t mention me. In case you missed that, the piece that Matty Healy is referring to, by our very own Laura Snapes, is this brilliantly angry yet clear-headed piece of campaigning journalism. Read it in the next ad break. The nominations for this category are often a bit suspect \u2013 pop groups versus Real Manly Bands. But in the 1975, you have a group that straddles the best of pop and rock \u2013 and ambient, trop house, jazz, We Didn\u2019t Start the Fire reduxes and all the rest of it, just going by their most recent record. To sound incredibly like a person who just turned 30, I love that the 1975 feel like an old-fashioned band \u2013 the kind where fans want to read everything they recommend, get tattoos of their lyrics and logos, and create community around. They\u2019re strong advocates for women, and when Matty Healy made questionable comments recently about the state of misogyny in hip-hop, he didn\u2019t double down, but apologised, properly, and promised to educate himself. Not to award medals for basic decency, but his response to the fans who held him to account feels like a positive model for the fan-artist relationship that so many acts take advantage of. Anyway, here they are, looking nicely cleaned up (no more of Matty\u2019s dodgy mohawk) and all having a lovely smooch with their girlfriends. And then \u2026 Oh my god. Matty Healy: \u201cI just want you to listen to me for one sec, just a couple of sentences that a friend of ours, Laura Snapes, said this, and I thought we should all really really think about it. She said that in music, \u2018male misogynist acts are examined for nuance and examined as traits of difficult artists while women and those who call them out are treated as hysterics who don\u2019t understand art.\u2019\u201d I had no idea that was going to happen. Matty is quoting from the comment piece I wrote about the allegations made against Ryan Adams last week. Exuding ruddy-cheeked asexual vigour like a Richard Curtis hero, or one of those butcher\u2019s mannequins come to cheerful life, it feels like George Ezra is the only thing holding Brexit-era Britain together by sheer force of his wholesomeness. If the pop thing goes south, you can imagine he\u2019d shrug gamely and go off to become a PE teacher and have four kids. He performs Shotgun, up for British single later on this evening, backed by lustrous vistas of Monument Valley. Some extremely supple bass guitar and robust brass back his summer road-trip anthem; if Hugh Jackman\u2019s tactic was, like the Aesop fable, to blow your coat off your back, then Ezra warms up the room to the point where everyone\u2019s ready to not just take off their coats, but skinny dip in the pool. Shotgun is a blast of pure positive energy that only the churlish, the contrarian and the people who you absolutely never want to be stuck in the kitchen at a house party hate. Jack Whitehall: \u201cWestlife announced that they were back in the studio. Suddenly a hard border with Ireland doesn\u2019t sound so bad.\u201d One swig, and a joyful one. Whitehall is really taking names, and I welcome it. I\u2019m quite surprised this didn\u2019t go to Jess Glynne, whose last album was the most successful new British album of last year after George Ezra\u2019s Staying at Tamara\u2019s, but I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t, because \u2026 well, she\u2019s terrible. Florence and Lily getting it somehow never seemed likely as the Brits push towards recognising a newer generation of artists. Anne-Marie is a compelling person but lacks the artistry to make her into a proper pop star, simply representing the most evolved point of the \u201cformer guest vocalist turned pop star\u201d nexus. And so Jorja Smith feels like a good choice: her debut Lost &amp; Found subverted her neo-soul template with its prickly atmosphere and jaded, post-Winehouse relationship lamentations remade for millennials. \u201cThis is for all the little girls and women who are being themselves and loving everything they\u2019re doing,\u201d Smith says, sweetly. HER: \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard, Nile, the future is female.\u201d Humour me for one second and imagine that Aphex Twin had won this. Imagine the malevolent avatar he would have sent to collect the award in his place while he spends the evening at home in Cornwall ignoring the whole thing. The appalled looks on the faces of major label executives as the squirming synths of T69 Collapse writhed around the O2. No? Obviously, rather than reward Richard D James \u2013 prone to impishness, fibs, and full-on disturbing vocals \u2013 the Brits have chosen his polar opposite in George Ezra: rosy of cheek, sweet of nature and deep of voice. His cheery guitar pop (which even I, black of soul, cannot find it within me to hate) dwells firmly in a genre that I like to call Massive In Cornwall, something I\u2019d like to be able to say about local man Aphex Twin, though sadly my petitions for Windowlicker to be adopted as the county\u2019s national anthem have fallen on deaf ears. Anyway, \u201cthe man we all love to love\u2026\u201d seems genuinely bowled over (\u201cOh my!\u201d) to win his first Brit award \u2013 potentially his first of three tonight. Hugh Jackman opens the show, ahead of a UK tour that starts in May in which he will perform songs from The Greatest Showman, Les Mis\u00e9rables and hopefully a musical theatre version of Hungry Like the Wolf dressed as Wolverine. Cynics will say that this is a shameless ploy to flog tickets to casual ITV viewers, and they would be absolutely right, but The Greatest Showman was the biggest selling album in the UK in 2018, and so it is absolutely right and proper he is here. He appears atop a pyramid of dinner-jacketed dancers, performing The Greatest Show, whose \u201cwhoa-oh-ohs\u201d are actually exactly the kind of thing you\u2019d hear in the chorus of a Brit awards-anointed, major label pop prospect. But turned up to an absurd fever pitch: every dial has been twisted to 11 for the Brits 2019 opening. You can do a fairly quick psychological assessment of our culture off the back of it: we all just want to have maximalist musical entertainment, of the likes of Bohemian Rhapsody, Mamma Mia! and A Star is Born, to deafen the awfulness of everything else in the world. \u201cAustralia\u2019s answer to Bradley Walsh\u201d, as Jack Whitehall bills him, proves the perfectly deafening tonic. \u201cIf you like your coffee decaf and your Nando\u2019s lemon and herb, strap in for the Prius of pop\u2026\u201d Jack Whitehall on George Ezra! Who \u2013 in classic nicest-guy-in-rock style \u2013 seems to have taken it well. Ben and I remain blissfully ignorant of what actually happens in The Greatest Showman. My guess: Huge Jackman is the ringmaster of a circus. He is a reserved man, uninterested in human contact, but the animals trust him. He falls in love with a human lady, who is mute, having been raised by wolves. She can only sing, and he only sings to her. A jealous gorilla (Bob) steals her away. Huge and Bob have to fight for her affections. They both die. It turns out that the lady can speak, and that this was all a ruse to let her enact her plan to return the animals to freedom. As she raises the gates on the lions\u2019 cage, she roars: \u201cThis is the greatest show, man!\u201d Fin. Ben\u2019s guess: From snatched snippets in online advertising and children singing in supermarkets, I can surmise that The Greatest Showman features Hugh Jackman playing a man possessed by the ghost of Gene Kelly, forced to hunt down a bearded woman to retrieve his true form, in the Moulin Rouge. Zac Efron co-stars. An incredibly baller move to open your awards ceremony with a spoof of the biggest cultural disaster in recent memory, but kudos Brits! Swimming pigs and blowjob jokes! Amazing. Christine and the Queens, nominated for international female, said she\u2019s encouraged by the gender and racial diversity of the nominees this year. She told me: \u201cIt feels amazing. It feels like women rule this year and the spectrum is really broad. I\u2019m nominated with Cardi B and Ariana Grande and we are all really different women in this industry, but we are trying to be fierce.\u201d She added that the industry was only scraping the surface when it came to women\u2019s equality. \u201cWe are only just starting to understand the struggle. From sound engineers to the artists, positions should be occupied by women. There are still lots of things to do.\u201d And with the arrival of Poppy Jamie \u2013 an \u201centrepreneur focused on creating tools to help people feel happier\u201d \u2013 that marks Shot No 1 (for me, at least) in the drinking game, under \u201cvisual presence of influencer who you couldn\u2019t identify in a life-or-death situation\u201d. Vick Hope, the Capital FM DJ who is the official host for the Brits on YouTube, said she\u2019s relieved to see Ella Mai nominated for breakthrough artist. \u201cShe deserves that and if she wasn\u2019t in that category, I\u2019d be quite upset. She has made one of the most important R&amp;B songs of the last few years. It took her a journey to get that recognition because she\u2019s been doing this, she\u2019s been around, but she\u2019s had to go to America to make that impact. And I don\u2019t want that to be the case, because she\u2019s a brilliant British artist. I want her to have her name here so we can show that she\u2019s flying our flag. I\u2019m so glad she\u2019s being recognised for that.\u201d Hope said she\u2019s thrilled to be covering the Brits. \u201cWhen I was younger, Brits night was a big night and I cared deeply who was going to win the awards, who was going to perform. I used to listen on the radio and used to have all the nominations written down in my look book and write who won each one. I really, really cared. Music for me was a release, an escapism and it was really exciting. I\u2019ve felt very proud of British artists from a young age. It\u2019s a no real brainer to want to be involved in it.\u201d Fresh off the back of winning two Grammys, American R&amp;B singer HER said she was excited to be at her very first Brit awards, where she\u2019ll be duetting with Jess Glynne later on. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to seeing the 1975,\u201d she told me. When asked if the nominations this year were diverse enough, she said yes, but added that she didn\u2019t know all the nominations. \u201cThis is my first time at the Brits. But I am excited to see all the women!\u201d At a nearby table, Giggs was notably absent. When asked where he was, the person sitting beside him shrugged and offered up his main course. Well, rude not to\u2026 Transport for London are up to their usual viral-chasing meme-lordery. Whoever works at North Greenwich underground station surely gets very little work done. Sir David Adjaye\u2019s statue sits at the latter end of the bottle opener to sex toy scale, with a distinctly 50 Shades vibe to its shadowy grey glass. A heavily pregnant Abbey Clancy showing the Meghan Markle-obsessed tabloids what \u201cflaunting\u201d your baby \u201cbump\u201d truly looks like, with admirable commitment. Chicken is on the menu at the Brits tonight, but the caterers seem somewhat stressed that none of the guests are that interested in sitting down and actually eating. Guests have an hour to get through three courses. But as for this Guardian reporter, I\u2019m not saying no to free food... More Bros, auditioning for a paint chart somewhere between \u201cTerracotta Sunrise\u201d and \u201cArizona Mustang\u201d. This might turn into a Bros appreciation liveblog for a while. More arrivals, beginning with Olly Alexander: Cruella de no chill. Lily Allen, presumably paying off her album advance with a witchcraft store on Etsy. Well done to Jorja Smith, for channelling vorticist painting and flapper dresses into what is presumably a comment on the overreaching industry economy of the 1920s. Bros appear to have announced a follow-up to their instant cult-hit documentary, What Happens When the Screaming Stops, which will focus on the making of their new album. Seems like a bit of a Faustian pact but when did this country ever learn to let a good joke lie, eh? I\u2019ve just met Emma Bunton, who said she\u2019s happy and relieved to be a bystander at this year\u2019s Brits awards. When asked whether it was weird to be watching the Brits after the Spice Girls\u2019 iconic 1997 performance \u2013 remember the Union Jack dress? \u2013 she laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s really lovely, and no there\u2019s no pressure. I love it. I get to have a glass of champagne and get to relax.\u201d She said she\u2019s really looking forward to the show\u2019s opening, which will be performed by Hugh Jackman, and excited to see Little Mix and Pink. Oh and her post-Brits tip? \u201cAlways get a McDonald\u2019s on the way home\u201d. Filth. Some more red carpet arrivals, beginning with designer Daniel Lismore, for who lis is most definitely not more. Rules of the game are: if you get the ball in his mouth, it\u2019s 50 points, the inner ring is 20, and the outer is just five. 50p please. At the other end of the spectrum, Hugh Jackman, who didn\u2019t get the memo that this is the Brits where you can dress like a Fifth Element extra and no one bats an eyelid. He\u2019ll be opening the ceremony, presumably with a whole bunch of Greatest Showman pizzazz. The brilliant Brockhampton, a nightmare for the paps trying to fit them all in one frame. They\u2019re who we want to win international group, but the likelihood is sadly low. Lots going on here, it\u2019s a bit like a hipster Where\u2019s Wally. And Florence Welch, who, as ever, looks like Miss Havisham moping about a Peckham co-working space. Aamna Modhin here, the Guardian\u2019s emissary at the event itself, where women are taking the lead in Brit nominations this year: for the second time in the awards\u2019 history, more women than men are up for the night\u2019s biggest prize \u2013 album of the year. Lilah Parsons, television and radio presenter on Heart FM, told me: \u201cIt\u2019s so exciting that women are dominating the shortlist this year. I\u2019m huge fan of Anne-Marie, and she\u2019s got four nominations, and of course Dua Lipa who has had the most incredible ride. I still remember playing her on the radio when she was super new. She\u2019s brilliant and a fantastic performer.\u201d Parsons said she\u2019s particularly excited to see what Jess Glynne manages to pull off this year. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop listening to her album. I think she writes great music with really impressive lyrics. I feel she\u2019s very honest and vulnerable and talks about things you can relate to, but she does it in a way that makes you feel strong. She talks about her insecurities and anxieties, which a lot of us do go through. But I find by listening to her, the way she sings about it, it\u2019s not in a kind of woe is me way, it gives you strength. I do think her music is empowering.\u201d Celebs have been arriving on the red carpet, ahead of the show which starts at 8pm on ITV1. Dua Lipa: when you\u2019ve got a fetish party at 3 but a leaver\u2019s ball at 6. Rudimental, looking like they\u2019re one blood-ink manifesto away from announcing their sex cult. Maya Jama: for all your shower foam needs. Shawn Mendes, who is the kind of handsome that makes mums start saying weird inappropriate things and then trying to brush them off like they\u2019re normal. Paloma Faith looks a bit like one of those cakes where there\u2019s a Barbie doll in the middle and the cake is baked around them, you know the ones? Or perhaps a 70s loo roll holder. Either way. If you have any ideas for drinking game rules, I\u2019m all ears. Last year was potentially so eventful that establishing a game felt like a risk. This year feels a bit more like we\u2019ll need to drink to get through it. Some rules to get us going: \u2022 Calvin Harris wins his first Brit \u2013 one swig (is all it takes) \u2022 Full house for any multiple-nominated artist \u2013 that\u2019s Dua Lipa, Anne-Marie, Jess Glynne, George Ezra, Jorja Smith, the 1975, Calvin Harris, Clean Bandit, Dan Caplen (I\u2019m sorry, who?), Demi Lovato, Florence + the Machine, Little Mix, Macklemore, Rita Ora, Rudimental and Tom Walker = as many shots as they win awards \u2022 Visual presence of influencer who you couldn\u2019t identify in a life or death situation \u2013 one shot (ideally of Flat Tummy Tea paired with mixer of choice) \u2022 Any moment more mortifying than Cheryl and Liam Payne\u2019s table interview last year (\u201cDo you have a safe word?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t stop\u201d) \u2013 three shots (or as many as needed to black out) \u2022 Weak statement about feminist empowerment \u2013 strong slug of ros\u00e9/prosecco/gin out of quirkily branded vessel \u2022 Jack Whitehall enjoying flirtatious banter with Love Island contestant \u2013 slurp of sun-warmed unbranded beer \u2022 Bros performatively fighting when they present an award \u2013 one shot \u2022 Bros\u2019s Matt Goss unleashing torturous metaphor when they present an award \u2013 the letters S.H.O.T.S are so important because they personify the word shots \u2022 One shot for every winner who fails to turn up to collect an international prize \u2022 Any member of the 1975 doing \u201cantics\u201d or going a bit off-piste \u2013 half a bottle, swigged as recklessly fast as possible \u2022 Idles either looking deathly bored or being goaded into naughtiness \u2013 one flaming sambuca A very warm welcome to our 2019 Brits liveblog. It\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s going to happen this year, isn\u2019t it? In 2018 we had all the Time\u2019s Up white rose pins and the prospect of artists making vaguely political and/or feminist statements at the podium. Ellie Goulding did one, but later admitted she was told to do (who by, we don\u2019t know), which sort of puts the whole empowering women/continuing to tell women what to do thing in perspective. There have been no massive issues going into the Brits this year \u2013 no #BritsSoWhite, no outcry over diversity. The male/female nominations are split precisely 50-50, though BAME artists received only 19 nominations compared with 42 by white acts. Perhaps there\u2019s not been much fuss because \u2026 the Brits commands ever decreasing levels of cultural relevance? Or \u2013 per Drake\u2019s declaration at the recent Grammy awards \u2013 today\u2019s pop acts care less and less about the validation of such industry bodies?
