Out of all the 28 players under par on the leaderboard, only Roberto Castro (-4), Jonas Blixt (-3) and Scott Jamieson of Scotland (-1) are still out on the course, and they've all got about two-and-a-half holes left between them to play. So I think it's good time to be wrapping this up, as none of them will be bothering the top-line story tonight, or the very top of the leaderboard. Which, after a double record-breaking day, looks like this: -9: Dufner -7: Scott, Kuchar, Furyk -6: Rose, Stenson -5: Garrigus, Stricker We're all set for a magical weekend of major championship golf. As if the first two days haven't been wonderful enough! Please join me for those. And hats off to The Somnambulist for his stunning 63! He'll sleep well tonight. Furyk perambulates up 18 without too much fuss. The overnight co-leader, who shot a stunning 65 yesterday, never quite got going in the same manner, but he was steadiness personified, and signs for a 68 which only had one blemish on it. He's only had two bogeys this week so far. Kucharesque, who in turn is Faldoffian. Last year's runner-up David Lynn couldn't quite keep his run going - he bogeyed 7 - but after finishing with a couple of pars, he signs for a 69 and another fine PGA weekend stretches out in front of him. Jonas Blixt is stumbling a wee bit on the way in, with bogeys at 15 and now 17, but he's still -3 overall. And Roberto Castro's having a fine day: out in 35, but birdies at 10 and 13 have taken him up to -4 with a couple of holes to play. Bradley sends his second shot from the bunker into lush rubbish at the front of 18, then fails to get up and down. A double to end with, and he signs for a 72, dropping back to +1 alongside Tiger. The pair trudge off to contemplate existential issues. Speaking of which, here's Ian Copestake again: \"My beautiful Norwegian stream has forsaken me. I will miss the Stenson bias and mildy xenophobic humour at the expense of golfing unknowns doing surprisingly well for once. I could describe the view out of my window but they gave me a room in the basement.\" Hold on, you're not chained to a radiator, are you? Should I call someone? Tiger's third into 18, a wedge. It's really poor, the act of a man who has given up. Except he never gives up, so ... eh ... huh? It's a lame lift to the front of the green, leaving only half a chance of saving par. He rattles his long par attempt up the green - and it's one dimple away from dropping, this round's final insult. He signs for a 70, remaining at +1, but that's not really how Tiger rolls. It's looking like a fifth year in a row without a major. Who thought we'd ever see the day, or before the 2020s at any rate? Furyk blasts out of the greenside rough at 17, but he can't get any spin on the ball and it races off past the hole by a good 20 feet. He can't knock in the par saver, and drops back to -7. Up on 18, Tiger needs all his superhuman strength to blast out from the deep verdant nightmare he was in. Annoying, but not as embarrassing as the fate that befalls his playing partner Keegan Bradley, who's in a bunker down the right, and blooters his second straight into the face of the trap! That's amateur nonsense. He'll not be escaping this hole with par, I can tell you that for free. Tiger's pocket of happiness had large holes in it. He's just ballooned a laughable drive into deep stuff miles to the right of 18. He has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed on the tee, and a bit fed up to boot. On 9, Marcus Fraser misses a par tiddler to end a very decent round in miserable fashion. He signs for a 69, -4 overall. But a better finish for Stenson, who uses his two putts for par on 18 and scribbles his signature at the bottom of a 66. He's -6 for the tournament at the halfway stage, tied at present for fifth. Furyk sends his approach at 17 into thick nonsense at the back of 17. He'll not enjoy the chip down the slope. Meanwhile on 16, KJ Choi nearly drains a 40-footer across the green for birdie. He taps in for par, remaining at level par for the tournament. It's worthy of note, though, because that would have put him in a position to tie Dufner's 63 with two pars! As things stand, he can still technically beat it, and break the major championship record! Given the sheer difficulty of the two closing par-fours, that's extremely unlikely, but what's the point of sport if we don't dream a few dreamy dreams? Tiger makes his birdie at 17! But only just, the ball threatening to lip out. He mock-collapses in irony - more shades of Faldo - his knees buckling, before acknowledging the roar of the crowd and letting a brief smile play across his face. He's back to level par. Up on 18, Stenson clanks a very average iron to the back-left corner of the green. Not much of a birdie chance, though that is Sergio Country. Tiger may have been all over the shop, both around the course and mentally, but the cream always rises, and from the first cut of rough to the left of 17, he guides a luscious long iron into the heart of the green, bumping the ball up to eight feet. Not a gimme birdie by any stretch, especially the way he's been putting today, but stunning nonetheless. Furyk strokes his second at 16 to four feet below the hole, and rolls in the birdie putt. He's now got the sole ownership of second spot at -8. I've just realised Matt Kuchar's bogey at 18 today - from short range, and all - was his first of the entire tournament! That is astonishingly Faldoesque behaviour! \"This course suits me well,\" he tells the man on the Sky telecast. It's about time this dude won a major, and this could easily be his week. Tiger misses the one coming back up 16, his second three putt in three holes. He's now back to +1, and driving the funk mothership into the heart of the sun. He's simply not been on it all day. \"Hey, Norwegian mini-bar bottles are huge (or seem so by now),\" writes Copestake, \"so expect updates until I work out how to get bongo back on the tv.\" The Somnambulist has just been interviewed about his round. He's a bit sad he didn't commit to his putt for 62, but is happy enough to share the major-championship record with some great names in history. And he's hoping for a bit of \"redemption\" by winning this after coming so close. You'd have a heart of stone not to wish him the best. -9: Dufner (F) -7: Scott (F), Kuchar (F), Furyk (15) -6: Rose (F), Stenson (17) -5: Garrigus (F), Stricker (F), Fraser (16*) David Lynn likes this tournament all right. He was the surprise runner-up at Kiawah last year, and now he's storming up the leaderboard, with a view to enjoying his weekend. After bogeys at 11 and 13, he's birdied 14, 18, 4 and now 5, and is -3 for the championship! Meanwhile on 16, Tiger races a dismal birdie effort six feet past the hole. He wanders after it with murderous intent. He's been a soul in torment today. Sergio rakes in a 30-footer for birdie on 18! He ends the day at -3 for the tournament! That's a very decent 68, and he's not quite out of this championship yet. I know, I know, but technically he's not, is he. \"Mr Copestake is so European that I picture him sitting in some Mitteleuropa bunker (like David Bowie in The Man Who Fell To Earth) with TV screens showing sport in 25 different languages, all of which he understands,\" writes Gary Naylor. \"I, on the other hand, am on holiday in Scandinavia, and haven't touched a drop all day. But I wish I had.\" Guardian live blogs: tediously cliquey? Naw naw naw naw naw! You can't say that! Dufner is pictured checking his card for that record-breaking 63. He looks slightly less interested than a man scrawling \"Toilet roll, kitchen roll, milk, teabags, 20 Bensons, eggs\" onto the back of an envelope. Maybe he'll be cheered by events on 18, where Kuchar prods a nervy par putt past the hole, dropping a shot. He settles for a 66 today, and a share of second in the clubhouse with Adam Scott at -7. \"I could swear Tiger muttered the words 'I'd rather be David James right now' as he went off 14,\" says Ian Copestake, now looking through the bottom of the bottles from the minibar. \"Such self-hate is sad to see.\" Tiger birdies 15, by the way. But while there's a sense of After The Lord Mayor's Show now, looking across this barren post-Somnambulist landscape, there's still some hot action going on out there. Kuchar managed to save his par on 17, and he looks like scrambling brilliantly on 18. Forced to lay up from a bunker, it looks as though his third, a wedge, is going to fly though the green, but it bites inches before landing in the thick stuff and spins back to five feet. He'll have a wonderful chance to stay at -8, a shot behind our leader Jason Dufner. That's unforgivable, really. Dufner allows himself a small sigh, but nothing more. He taps in for his par - rather nervously, it has to be said - and signs for a 63! He might not have broken new ground in major championships, but he's broken new ground here. Webb Simpson equalled the course record 64 of Ben Hogan and Curtis Strange a few hours ago, but he's already been wiped from the record books. Dufner is Oak Hill's new daddy. See what a nice lie-in can do? He ambles off for a snooze. ... he leaves it short. Ach. There goes history, then. He left it short. Tiger has smacked his tee shot at 15 to four feet, then stomped off down the hole in high dudgeon. I'm not sure he cares about birdie here, or even knows where he is. He's funkadelic. But never mind that, because up on 18, Dufner stands over his ball, draws his putter head back and ... To matters of greater import, and up on 18, Jason 'The Somnambulist' Dufner arrows an iron straight at the flag from the centre of the fairway. What a stunner under pressure! He'll be left with an uphill putt from 15 feet for a 62! A 62!! And a place in history!!! Just don't leave it short, Jason. Just don't leave it short and die wondering. Sandbags around Wales! Sandbags around Wales! He's three putted! He's three putted! Tiger races his eagle putt five feet past the hole, then sends the return lipping out on the left. He's a-bubblin'! He wanders off the green, a bain marie of belligerence. Storm's a-comin'! New York state in serious danger of being steam-blasted across the briny! Dufner splits the fairway at 18. These are astonishing scenes, and we're not even at the business end of the hole yet. Can he make history? We'll find out, soon enough. Meanwhile, in the name of tension release, let's hear from Ian Copestake who, I assume, on holiday somewhere in Scandinavia, loading up on very expensive Golf Enhancers from the minibar. \"Lovely to hear the Norwegian commentary chap say 'Stenson, Stenson, Stenson' as his putt trickled to the hole,\" he reports, \"before unleashing the word 'Iceman!' when the ball finally drops.\" Right on cue, he's just mishit a birdie putt up the 15th green, leaving himself a tricky four footer to save par and remain at -6. Oh Iceman! Dufner's birdie effort up 17 slides to the left of the cup by half an inch. He's got to settle for par, and momentarily thinks about showing some emotion, before thinking, nah, balls to it, that'd involve raising a wry eyebrow and I only winch those up in exceptional circumstances. A par down the last and he's got the Oak Hill (East) course record. A bogey and he shares it with Webb Simpson, Curtis Strange, and Ben Hogan. But a birdie, and he'll be signing for a 62. A 62! Which would be the lowest round in the history of all the major championships. He's been inches away from birdies at 15 and 17, too. Just imagine what we'd be thinking right now if those had dropped. Sheer brilliance from Tiger on 14, as he becomes the first player today to drive the green! He welts the thing down the right, and flies the ball over the bunkers guarding the putting surface at the front. That's outstanding. If he three putts from there, expect the steam from his lugs to aquaplane the state of New York across the Atlantic and halfway up a mountain in Wales. Kuchar drives into filth down the left of 17. On 16, McDowell - at -1 for the championship - rattles a putt into the cup for birdie, but the ball after dipping decides to spin up and back out. He walks off looking confused. He's missed about six or seven putts by an inch or two today. By God the margins are fine in professional golf. From the fringe at the back of 14, Stenson bumps a birdie putt up to the hole. It nearly stops on the lip for the second hole in a row, but this time the luck's with him, and it drops into the cup. He's -6. \"If David James had been American he would have faced failure by high-fiving the nearest defenders and repeating his non-failure mantra that he, Jamesie, is the best,\" suggests Ian Copestake. \"While mentally blocking out the word Calamity.\" I'll remind him of it, syllable by syllable, if I ever see him. Though I'll probably have to join a long queue snaking down the street. Mixed news of Sergio - isn't it always - as he drops a shot at 15, but then manufactures a clever Scottish bump-and-run from under hanging trees down the right of 16 to scramble par. And nearly drained a long birdie putt, too. He's -2. Meanwhile up on 16, Kuchar birdies to snatch second place all to himself; he's -8 now. And on 17, Dufner continues to move serenely to his 63. He creams a hybrid into the heart of the green, and he'll have yet another birdie chance. The lowest score in any major, incidentally, is 63. It's been achieved 25 times, the last time by Steve Stricker at Atlanta Athletic Club in the 2001 PGA. He couldn't, could he? Garrigus chips brilliantly from the thick stuff at the back to 18 to four feet, then gives up on his short par putt mid-stroke. That's the worst putt of the week by some distance, a terrible wooden clack. He's had putting troubles for years - remember the toy putter he carried around at the 2011 US Open? - and that's not going to help his mental state. He ends the day with a 68, bogeys at the last two holes. He's -5. Back on 12, Furyk gets up and down from a greenside bunker to save his par and stay at -7. Stenson can't believe his luck on 13. He's hitting a long birdie putt down the green. It's a treacherous putt, but he claps it along a perfect line - and yet somehow manages to underhit it by a couple of millimetres! That's a strange par. How that never dropped, the ball seemingly applying brakes, I'll never know. Back on 4, Fraser birdies, following up another at 2, to move to -5. And up on 16, Dufner dribbles his birdie putt, left to right, into the cup for yet another birdie! He's -7 for the day, -9 for the tournament, and two pars from breaking the course record! Garrigus has blootered his second shot into 18 straight through the green. He'll have a hell of a job getting up and down for par from there, and his round is coming apart at the death. But Kuchar is pootling along very nicely indeed. Out in 33, he's birdied 12 and 14, and now makes a decent par saver on 15 to remain at -7. This is a very interesting leaderboard: -8: Dufner (15) -7: Scott (F), Kuchar (15), Furyk (11) -6: Rose (F), Garrigus (17) -5: Stricker (15), Stenson (12), Blixt (10) Henrik Stenson isn't the only Swede bothering the top of the leaderboard. Jonas Blixt shot 68 yesterday, and he's birdied 5, 9 and now 10 to move to -5 for the tournament. Tiger walks off 12 with the heat on, having misdirected a wedge into the green, 40 feet from the flag. He takes his two putts for par, but there's no happiness to be found. The same can't be said for the Sunny Somnambulist, who once more claps an approach to birdie-making distance, this time on 16. Another chance to make a 63 a very real possibility. Birdie for Sergio at 14! He's -3 overall. This is most unSergioesque behaviour, he's just plodding around in a quiet, professional manner. No huge meltdowns yet, and no birdie blitzes either. I'm really not sure what to make of this. Meanwhile on 17, Garrigus splashes from the bunker into the heart of the green, then nearly drains the par putt. He's the thickness of the paint of the logo on his ball away, but that's enough for a shot to be shed. He's back to -6. Dufner hits his birdie putt dead on line - but doesn't give it enough juice! What an opportunity to move to -7 for his round, within touching distance of the course record! For once, he looks a little bit disappointed, perhaps fully aware that history could be his if he keeps things going. Garrigus gets a swing at the ball down 17, but he can only belt the thing up the left and into the bunker at the front of the green. Now Dufner sends his tee shot at 15 right over the top of the flag, the ball rolling back to 12 feet. He'll have that for birdie and a two-shot lead. Up on 17, Garrigus wangs his drive into trees down the left. He won't be able to reach the green from there, and he might not even have a swing. Of course, all of that conveniently forgets the efforts of Dufner, who is -6 for his round, and - having just got in for par at 14 - only needs four more of them to equal the course record himself. Jim Furyk birdies 10 to move to -7. This is a marvellously solid performance from the 2003 US Open winner. Not so solid from Tiger, though, who does well to chip out to 12 feet, but can't save his par from there, and drops back to +1. Hideki Matsuyama isn't far from registering his fifth birdie of the day at 14, but the ball slips just past the hole. He'll make his par, staying at -2 for the tournament. He went out in 31 strokes, incidentally. Meanwhile, there's more potential course-record-bothering shenanigans afoot: Peter Hanson, playing the back nine first, went \"out\" in 30 strokes, with birdies at 12, 15, 16, 17 and 18. That's preposterous scoring, given the nature of those closing holes! Anyway, he's bogeyed 1, but is still -4 for the day, like Matsuyama. A couple more birdies for these lads, and they'll be joining Simpson, Hogan and Strange on the Oak Hill roll of honour! Dufner's busy making a meal of 14. He didn't try to drive the green, and has left his chip short, the ball only finding the middle of the putting surface and spinning a long way back. He'll have a tough two putt up the hill to remain sole leader. Back on 11, Bradley (-2) makes the front of the green with his tee shot, while Tiger buries his in the thick stuff, underclubbing, and will do well to get up and down from that. Well here's a test to Casey's temperament: he clanks an awful tee shot at the par-three 15th into the water to the right of the green. That's abysmal; the flag's on the other side of the green! He stomps about for a bit, walking away from the scene of his crime in disgust. Meantime Tiger sails an approach over the flag at 10 to ten feet, but his birdie putt back down the green slides by on the left. He remains at level par for the tournament. It's just not happening for Casey with his putter. He drives into the bunker at 14, splashes out to 12 feet, but leaves the birdie effort out on the high side. No goofy grin this time, but fair's fair: at least he's not letting these lost opportunities get him down. Like Stenson, he's not let his shoulders drop, and he hasn't allowed himself to get a cob on. If he can hang on in there, it's an attitude which may do him some good over the weekend. Sergio totally misreads a putt on 12 from six feet. That was nearly a foot to the left of the hole! Naw naw naw, that's no good. Up on 15, Garrigus gives himself a 12-footer for birdie, and a share of the Somnambulist's lead, but he doesn't hit the putt and remains at -7. Our sleepwalking friend strokes a wedge at 13 to eight feet. He then clips the downhill right-to-left putt into the middle of the cup for birdie. Jason Dufner is now the sole leader of the PGA. Stenson is oh-so-close to draining a long birdie putt up 10. He grabs his head with both hands and acts out mock shock to the gallery. He's enjoying his round today. \"Of course, there's a happy medium between the wide-grinning ironic idiocy of Casey and the endless sulk of Tiger at the majors when it comes to appropriate reactions,\" opines Alistair Mackay. \"I think our sleepwalking friend in a share of the lead might be able to teach them both a thing or two. For a moment on the replay of his eagle shot earlier it looked like he was staring at his divot before noticing that the ball had rolled into the hole. What a delightful fellow.\" The 9th hole caused Tiger all sorts of pain yesterday, as he double bogeyed it. Today he's not much happier walking off the green, though for significantly different reasons. His second shot was a huge cut round an overhanging tree to find the heart of the green. He then hit a fine putt which stopped one turn short of the hole. It had looked like birdie all the way. Funk on. But at least it didn't get any worse - and it nearly did, as he angrily stabbed at his ball to tap in his par - and nearly whiffed it, Hale Irwin style! Par. Funk still on. Garrigus wasn't far away from recording a Mickelsonian birdie at 14 - driving into a tree, then chipping to ten feet - but he couldn't slip the putt away. He stays at -7. Just behind now at -6 is Matt Kuchar, who slides a right-to-left-to-right birdie effort in from 15 feet. That's his third birdie of the day, on a card as yet without blemish. Stenson isn't too far away from curling in a left-to-right 25-footer on 9 for birdie, but he's still out in 32 strokes, and pleasantly placed. I've just seen a re-run of the Casey missed putt on 13, and it's a shocker, a real tiddler, but what's worse is his newly found habit of responding to mistakes by plastering a big ironic grin across his puss. Nope! No! Stop it! David James used to do that all the time when keeping goal for Liverpool, and look what happened there. It can't be good subconsciously. -7: Scott (F), Garragus (13), Dufner (12) -6: Rose (F), Furyk (7) -5: Hoffman (14), Kuchar (11), Stenson (9) Paul Casey's round went the shape of a comice after those three birdies on the spin between 4 and 6, with bogeys at 7, 9 and 11. But he's still -3 for the tournament, and has just stroked a gorgeous approach at the long par-five 13th to six feet. That should see him up to -4. Ah but it doesn't. Confidence shaken, he can't make it. Such a shame. Up on 11, Sergio isn't far off draining an uphill 30-footer for birdie, but remains at -2. And on 14, Hoffman drives into the bunker at the front of the green, splashes out to three feet, and knocks in the birdie putt to move to -5. The projected cut is +3. Should it stay at that point, we'll definitely be saying TTFN to Nicolas Colsaerts, Bubba Watson, Martin Laird, Luke Donald and the last PGA winner here, Shaun Micheel. And if they don't get a wriggle on this afternoon, we'll also be bundling chaps like Ernie Els, Charl Schwartzel, Stewart Cink, YE Yang and Paul Lawrie onto the nearest bus. Tiger clacks his iron into 8 pin high, but it's a good 30 feet left of the pin, and he throws his club down on top of his bag in disgust. He knows he needs a little more, without getting too desperate too early. Back on 7, Furyk - who has been steady all the way round so far - races a birdie putt miles past the hole. Suddenly a bogey is staring him in the face. But he rolls the saver into the heart of the cup and moves on, still at -6. Up on 12, the co-leader Dufner sends an iron sailing over the flag and dropping softly 15 feet from the cup. The Somnambulist is joint leader of the 95th PGA! He tickles in his uphill birdie putt at 11, a gentle left-to-right slider which was always rolling into the cup. He's -7, alongside Scott and Garrigus, though the latter's got a 15-footer on 13 after clattering his approach pin high. Scrub that, he doesn't hit it. Par. Meanwhile Stenson makes his birdie at 8. But back on 11, Stricker inexplicably three-putts from the front of the green - he'd lagged up his first to a couple of feet - and drops back to -4. Stenson could have let the shoulders slump and the wheels clank off after that early short missed birdie putt. But he's kept going, and after birdies at 4 and 5, he's placed an approach into 8 to six feet, and will be putting to move to -5. Meanwhile Charley Hoffman is on a bit of a charge: birdies at 10 and now 13, and he's -3 for the day and -4 for the tournament. Tiger's turned his round, eh, around with those back-to-back birdies. But he's failed to reach 7 in regulation, and he's in thick rough and snookered behind a bunker. Shortsided, too. No matter! He whips up a gorgeous lob, dropping his ball on the very front edge of the green and letting it roll to five feet. Doesn't sound like much, but to get so close from where he was seemed almost impossible. That'll surely be a spectacular par - and momentum - save. Steve Stricker's a fully-paid-up member of that - let's face it - not so exclusive club of Best Players Never To Win A Major. This couldn't be, could it? The relentless putting machine has just rolled one in at 10 for birdie, his third of a very steady day. He's -5, and has just found the front of 11 with his tee shot. That's nowt compared to his playing partner The Somnambulist, though: Dufner's clattered his iron to six feet. He'll have an extremely makeable putt for birdie, and a share of that lead with Scott and Garrigus! Scott's back, you'll all be pleased to learn. Scott and Garrigus have a share of the lead on -7, but the way the American is looking I'll be bound he won't have that share by the end of the day. With that, here's Scott Murray. Garrigus is not really reading these greens. He sends his ball well out to the left of the cup on 12, a pretty poor putt all things considered. He looks nervous and a little out of his depth, perhaps a touch of vertigo as he looks down from on top of the leaderboard. He drops the par putt in though. Garrigus tees off on the par 4 12th with caution, aiming an iron into the middle of the fairway. His approach into the green is reasonable but has left him a long old putt. On six, Bradley rolls his birdie putt just past the pin. Woods, though, makes no mistake at all. He goes to evens with a very solid putt, though that scowl is still firmly on his coupon. Here comes Sergio! From the front of the green at nine, he wafts a majestic chip to within a hair of the hole. The big tease is on! Get your juices flowing, get your anticipation high, the Sunday meltdown is nigh. Woods at the par three six clips an extremely neat iron pin high and to within five feet for an excellent birdie chance. The scowl is beginning to slide from his face. Only beginning, mind. Bradley plonks his tee shot safely, though unambitiously into the middle of the green. Davis Love III puts his onto the green too, though he's in a different post code than the cup. Casey on the tenth lines up his birdie putt to go to -5. Then slides it past the hole. He gives the crowd a big grin, despite seeing the ball roll by. Nice to see. Elsewhere Tiger birdies five to go to +1 and put a little distance between himself and the likely-looking cut at +3. While Garrigus rattles in a hearty birdie two at 11 to go back to -7 and a share of the lead. \"GO SERGIO!! It's written! He's going to win! Major champion! Destiny!\" hollers Simon McMahon. \"Sorry, got a bit carried away there, thought I'd sneak that in while Scott's out.\" He'll be choking on his Hamburger Helper. Kuchar, who has played very tidily so far today pars 8 having picked up shots at 1 and 6. He's -2 for the round and -5 for the tournament and looking solid enough. Garcia on 8 ... the ball is rolling, rolling ... rolling ... rolling. It stops on the edge of the cup \u2026 then drops! He goes to -2. Garrigus takes the dodgem car approach on the green at 10. His birdie puttl weaves this way, then that way, off the fringe then back out into the green. Suddenly he looks wobbly, having dropped a shot at nine. With his cap peak pulled low, he misses his par putt and drops to -6 to give Scott the sole lead. Woods doesn't hit his putt on four so pars to remain at +2. Stenson, on the other hand, birdies and foes to -3. On 10, Garrigus hits a lovely tee shot but then takes out most of the fairway as he plays his way towards the green, a large chunk of turf flying into the air as he gets a little fat on his iron approach. Woods resists the urge to run the ball right up to the pin from the bunker on the par 5 fourth, afraid of overhitting and seeing his ball run off the back. He's in the middle of the green and will be going well to get down in one putt. No such worries for Bradley, who is in that back fringe Tiger was avoiding, and misses chipping in by an inch. Garrigus, on 9, pitches to within five feet then has a little uphiller for par. There's a big 'OOOOHHHH' as it lips out though, so he drops down to -7 and Scott once again has a share of the lead. Woods on 4 swishes a few practice strokes from the rough having just avoided some really unpleasant filth. He hoicks a five wood, having set the controls to full steam ahead, but it splashes into the greenside bunker. Could have been worse, but he's irked that it didn't kick on another couple of feet onto green. Evening everyone. Here's the leaderboard as things stand. -8: Garrigus (8) -7: Scott (F) -6: Rose (F), Dufner (6), Furyk (2) -5: Casey (7), Kuchar (6) Robert Garrigus strokes in a 20-footer on 8, to grab the sole lead! He's missed six of the last seven cuts, by all accounts. That won't be happening today, unless he's taken over by the soul of Maurice Flitcroft. Meanwhile Tiger is a dimple away from draining his birdie chance on 3, but will need to settle for par. So unlucky. Meanwhile Furyk isn't far away from a second bird on the bounce at 2, but remains at -6. Anyway, with that, I'm slipping off for a bite of the most jingle-tastic food to be ever marketed by a golf glove. Tom Bryant will be your guide for the next string of minutes. See you soon. Casey had started brilliantly, but he looks like dropping one on 7. Sending his approach wide left of the green, he duffs his chip, only finding the fringe. He'll be faced with a long test if he wants to save his par. Meanwhile David Hearn's carded back-to-back bogeys at 14 and 15, dropping back to -2 overall. Still only one par for the Canadian today. It's not quite happening for Tiger yet. He sends his tee shot at 3 into the heart of the green, leaving himself a 20-footer up the hill for birdie, but his mood doesn't change much, his playing partner Keegan Bradley having clattered his tee shot to a couple of feet. Up on 6, Dufner maintains his momentum by getting up and down from a tight lie, shortsided to the right of the green. Steve Stricker looks on song today. He's birdied 4, and like Garrigus before him, clips a brilliant iron to a couple of feet at 6. He'll make birdie, unless his basic motor skills desert him, and move to -4. This could be a low-scoring afternoon. Which brings me to Sergio, who has birdied 4 to move back to -1. A trademark blitz, like the old days? Only if he starts smiling again. Aphibarnrat pulls his second into 16, but from deep rough to the left of the green, slams a one-bounce high lob into the cup! He's -3. Marcus Fraser drains a 20-footer on 12 to move to -4. Casey makes it three birdies in a row at the par-three 6th. Garrigus engineers a slippery escape from 7 with par, after chipping crisply to four feet from trouble among the trees! Tiger can't save his par on 2, though, splashing to eight feet from the sand but letting his saver slide away to the right of the hole. Tiger scrambled well at the opening hole, but he'll need to do the same thing again down 2, sending his second shot whistling into a bunker to the left of the green. Meanwhile back on 1, Furyk, one of the two overnight leaders, rakes in a 40-foot right-to-left breaker! Probably just as well the hole got in the way, because that downhill effort was travelling, but that was magnificent nevertheless. He's -6! As is The Somnambulist! Dufner must think he's still dreaming - and perhaps still is, because let's not rule out sleepwalking - after rattling in another birdie putt, this time on 5! Garrigus responds to taking a share of the lead by hooking an appalling iron into deep trouble down the left of 7. Tiger finds the rough again from the tee, down the right at 2. And Stenson misses his short putt at 2, which is not so superlative. Here's the latest leader board, which may see a fair bit more action this afternoon: -7: Scott (F), Garrigus (6) -6: Rose (F) -5: Casey (5), Dufner (4), Furyk -4: Simpson (F), Kaymer (F), Hearn (4*), Kuchar (4) Tiger escapes from the opening hole with par, knocking in his very missable saver! He still doesn't look particularly content, but that's a fine up and down from the other side of the creek on the fairway. Henrik Stenson lands his approach to 2 in the centre of the green, then spins his ball back to four feet. That's more superlative major-championship golf from the Open runner up, who posted 68 yesterday. Garrigus makes his birdie at 6 to move to -7, while Casey puts his way on 5 to move to -5. Casey looks in carefree mood today. At 5, he clacks one of the shots of the day to five feet. Then on the tee at 6, Garrigus - who has just birdied 5 to move to -6 - plonks a wonder iron to three feet and will surely grab himself a share of the lead. Tiger, meanwhile, knocks his third at 1 to 12 feet, giving himself chance of saving par. Tiger already has the face on. He's like thunder. After such a careless tee shot, he stomps up to his ball, snatches a wedge from the hand of his caddy, and hacks back out onto the fairway. He just stepped into that shot, without breaking stride, and without taking any practice swing. Not happy. At the other end of the scale is The Somnambulist. Another Jimenezesque golfing hero, he's swanning around like a bloke off to the shops to buy a pint of milk, full fat because it tastes better, and the paper, though if the shop's sold out of milk and papers, or if the shop's shut, then so be it. He rakes in a long birdie effort across 4 to move to -5. He's two off the lead! I should probably mention what happened to Miguel Angel Jimenez, shouldn't I, seeing if there's any golfer in the world we'd all wish to be, he'd be it. He clanked about the back nine, his opening stretch of holes today, in 38 shots, a run which included three birdies, two bogeys, and two double bogeys. Then he carded eight straight pars, before finishing off at 9 with a birdie! What a player. What a man. That's a two-over 72 and he's level par overall; some would drown their sorrows at being unlikely to win the tournament in red wine. He'll celebrate life with the stuff instead. Tiger's out and about, too. And whether he traverses the course with a face on may be dependent on how quick a start he gets. He needs to launch a charge after the way yesterday's round petered out. He takes 3-wood off the tee at 1 for accuracy, and plonks it into the thick, wet stuff down the right. Temper's a-tickin'. But all situations are recoverable, pretty much, and the Canadian David Hearn, who doubled 11, has bounced back with birdies at 12 and 13, and returns to the mark of -4 at which he started proceedings today. Sergio's out and about. I'm not sure if this qualifies as news, but people put up any old thing on the internet: he's bogeyed the opening hole. He's back to level par for the tournament, and should look to Justin Rose's terrible start to his 66 for succour, but probably won't. Up on the par-five 4th, Paul Casey has a 12-footer for eagle, but doesn't hit his putt. That's a gift horse packed off to the dentist, really, but still a birdie; he's -4. Casey's playing partner Hunter Mahan birdies the hole too, his second on the bounce, and moves to -2. Scott will probably be a tad disappointed with that round of 68. He missed three short putts over the closing stretch, each one a pretty dismal business, tell the truth. He could so easily have been scribbling his name at the bottom of a second 65 on the bounce, which would be some effort. He won't be too downhearted, of course, but his travails with the putter will give the rest of the field a chance to overhaul him. If he could keep it going all the time, he'd be by some distance the best player in the world right now, no argument. But he can't, and he isn't, and such is golf. Scott clips a tasty approach to 9 to 12 feet, but again his putter lets him down. He walks off shaking his head, as miserable as you like. He's the current leader at -7, but only a shot ahead of Rose now, who hit his second to four feet, rattled in the putt, and signs for a majestic 66, some score considering he bogeyed his first two holes. He only took 29 strokes on the front (and his back) nine. He's -6 for the tournament. Truly magnificent stuff, from the only major champion to ever purchase a doner kebab from Chick-Mex in Basingstoke. The 2010 champion Martin Kaymer signed for a blemish-free 68. That's his second 68 of the week, and places him at a very useful -4. Also making early positive moves in their rounds: Matt Kuchar (a birdie at 1 to move to -4), Kiradech Aphibarnrat (bogey at 11 followed by birdies at 12 and 13 to rise to -3) and Jason 'The Somnambulist' Dufner, who has eagled out at 2 to climb to -4, and will have had a nice long lie-in to boot. As for the defending champion Rory McIlroy, well, what a strange round he ended up carding. A one-over 71, but that doesn't tell half the story: he was out in 39 strokes, four over par, and bogeyed 1 too, but then birdied 3, 4, 7 and 8 to get in at level par for the tournament. He'll not be winning this week - his game simply isn't in good enough nick - but he says he'll be taking positives from his round today. Which, given where he started the week, and how he left his last major at this stage, is an understandable viewpoint to take. While Simpson and Rose have been wreaking havoc, I've forgotten to tell you what Lee Westwood was getting up to at the end of his round. Which was just as well, really. He fell to bits today, really: after early birdies at 12 and 14, it was all downhill. Bogeys at 17 and 2 we know about; a double bogey at 8 followed by a closing bogey at 9 we didn't. He signs for a three-over 73, which looks pretty grim after yesterday's 66. He's still at -1 for the tournament, and far from out of it, but the denouement of that round looks pretty damn costly. Chances are, it's yet another blank year in the majors for - hey, it's beginning to look desperate - the New Monty. Rose made the centre of the 8th green in much less fussy style than Scott, and rolls a birdie putt into the centre of the cup from 15 feet. He's -5 for the tournament, and -5 along this front nine! Scott, meanwhile, sends yet another putt sliding off to the left. He's not keeping the toe of his putter under control at all, the thing lifting off the ground on impact and costing him shot after shot. He remains at -7, but with Rose, Garrigus and Simpson moving closer, he could be forgiven for feeling a little shakier than he probably should with a two-stroke lead. Garrigus has just followed up his opening-hole birdie with another at 2, and is -5 for the tournament. Simpson has proved there are scores out here today, and with conditions expected to improve on the soggy morning, quite a few players will be eyeing up a charge. On the back of that awful short par miss, Scott sends his drive down 8 whistling into nonsense along the right. But he's awarded a huge stroke of luck. His ball in tight bother, it's picked up by a young spectator, and so he's gifted a free drop. The improved lie allows him to bump a low-running ball of not inconsiderable genius under a hanging branch and up into the green, to eight feet. That's such a clever shot, in the Scottish style. He keeps coming close at the Open for a reason, you know. WEBB SIMPSON TIES THE COURSE RECORD WITH A 64!!! He makes it home, six under for the day, after parring the 9th in spectacular fashion, getting up and down from a tricky greenside bunker! He's the third player to shoot 64 in competitive golf at Oak Hill (East), after Ben Hogan (1942 Times-Union Open) and Curtis Strange (1989 US Open). He's also right in the mix for this tournament, having jumped 71 places as things stand: he's tied in third place at -4, three off Adam Scott's lead! -7: Scott (16*) -5: Furyk -4: Simpson (F), Kaymer (17*), Rose (16*), Garrigus (1) Scott chops out to five feet; he'll have a decent chance to save his par. Rose elegantly flips from the sand to two feet; he should save his par, too. Mickelson is faced with a 20-footer to save his, but can't make it. He's +2. Scott, the toe of his putter sticking miles in the air on contact, sends his par putt left of the hole; he drops a shot too. He's -7. And finally Rose puts his par putt away, and suddenly looks in a very healthy position at -4. Lefty, perhaps desirous of not becoming a YouTube sensation, decides to take his medicine and prod his ball back out onto the fairway, rather than risk falling back into the blue vagueness. His playing partners are in a small spot of bother, too: Rose dumps his approach into the bunker at the front of the green, while Scott plonks his into thick rough to the left of the green. Meanwhile Jason Day and Scott Piercy have both signed for 71s, both adding to opening-round 67s which means they end the day at -2 for the tournament. Mickelson has just hoicked his tee shot at 7 into the drink down the right. Ah, hold on, no, his ball is teetering on the edge of the bank. It's dry, but the problem is, he'll be standing on a pile of unsteady rocks to make his swing. If he gives that ball a clatter, and the rocks shift, he could be toppling back into the briny. Meanwhile there's a good start to the round for the handily placed Robert Garrigus, who birdies the opening hole to move to -4 for the championship. Simpson is this far away from stroking in a 15-foot birdie effort on 8. Had that gone in - and it was a dimple from dropping - he'd have been a par away from the course record. As it is, he's a par away from a share of it. Which is still not the worst position to be in. Back on 6, Rose Mickelsons a high flop, dropping a high ball on the apron and letting it release towards the hole. It's a brilliantly engineered shot, and should save his par. Which it does. Scott meanwhile rattles in his birdie putt, and rises back to -8. He lets very little faze him, a magnificent player. Rose has been on one hell of a charge, but he's in danger of losing momentum here, plonking an iron at the par-three 6th into the deep stuff on the knoll to the right of the green. The pin's on that side, so he's not much room to work with. The aggravated look on his coupon suggests he doesn't fancy it much. Scott, who hasn't been quite the force of the first hour and a bit, looks to regain some momentum of his own, hitting his tee shot pin high to eight feet. Marvellous chance to re-establish a three-shot lead over Furyk, who isn't out for over an hour yet. Mickelson, flirting this time with ridiculousness rather than trees, finds the centre of the green from deep in bother, then nearly drains the birdie putt. He's still +1. Rose continues his birdie blitz, though: after pausing awhile with par at 4, he's stroked in a 15-footer here on 5 to move to within three of the lead at -4. Scott remains at -7 with a steady par. Simpson had actually got himself into bother down 7 with his second shot, an awful iron hoicked over a tree down the right from the fairway. He had a route into the green, but from deep rough couldn't get up and down. So he's back to -4 for the tournament, but we're interested in the course record. Two more pars, and he's signing for a six-under 64, which is something only Ben Hogan and Curtis Strange have managed here in tournament golf. Mickelson has wanged another tee shot into trouble, this time miles to the left of 5. You wouldn't have him any other way, now. Elsewhere, Boo Weekley, of 2008 Ryder Cup fame, is making a bit of a charge up the leaderboard, birdies at 10, 11 and 14 bringing him up to level par for the championship. Pars for the major winners down the par-five 4th. Scott's putter has gone cold. I suppose the warmth generated by his hands takes a lot longer to travel down his lengthy shaft. He watches in horror as his short birdie putt breaks hard right at the death, having splashed well out of sand. Rose misses a makeable birdie putt, too. Mickelson, who had been flirting with trees back up the hole, seems the happiest with his par. But never mind all that, what about this course-record attempt of Simpson's? Well, he's driven into trouble down 7, so chances are his blemish-free card will soon have a mark on it - and Hogan and Strange will at the very least still have a share of the record. Simpson just cannot be stopped. He drained a 35-footer on 5 for his sixth birdie of the day, and has just made yet another at 6. He's -5 for the tournament, but more relevantly is now on for a course-record 63 if he pars the last three holes of his round. This is astonishing. Rose, high on life and golf, blooters his tee shot into rough down the right of 4. It's not OB, but neither is it any good. Mickelson and Scott both find the fairway which, saturated with rain, offers little in the way of release. Manassero, who had been going so well, has just doubled 16 to drop back to level par. And the current clubhouse leader, for what that's worth at this very early stage of proceedings, is Ryo Iskikawa, who has signed for a 71 to go along with yesterday's 69, and is level par for the tournament at the halfway mark. Webb Simpson is on target to equal the course record! He's birdied 5, his sixth of the day; four pars will see him sign for a 64, like Hogan and Strange before him. Another birdie, and we're publishing a new record book, as opposed to rewriting the old one, which seems a bit previous to me, seeing someone else authored it. Anycase, he's now -4 for the tournament, in a tie for third place. And he's only three off the lead, because Scott couldn't make his long par saver on 3 and drops back to -7. Rose, meanwhile, drained his birdie chance to make it up to -3, while, yes, Mickelson made his par. How. The. Hell. -7: Scott (12*) -5: Furyk -4: Westwood (15*), Simpson (14*), Kaymer (13*), Hearn -3: Rose (12*), Garrigus, Casey, Kuchar, Fraser Mickelson's tee shot was so awful that his view to the green was obscured by the grandstand. It's a fortunate break, which means he gets to pluck his ball out of thick nonsense, and drop it in an area which has been trampled down by paying punters. Lucky Lefty! And what do you know, he nearly bumps the chip up the green and into the hole. That would have been one of the most preposterous birdies of all time. He'll still have a bit of work to do to save his par, as the ball's rolled a few feet past the hole, but even so. Meanwhile Scott's chip isn't half as good; he practically chunks it, leaving a long putt for par. Rose clatters an iron to the back of the par-three 3rd. The ball bites and zips back a good 20 feet. He'll have a decent chance from 15 feet for a third birdie in a row. The leader Scott, however, pushes his tee shot into thick hell atop a bank to the right of the green. And anything Scott can do, Mickelson can do even better. He pulls his tee shot in the same direction, then drops his club as he considers holding his head in his hands, before cupping his mitts around his mouth to holler FORE RIGHT! That ball's gone miles to the right of the green, over the galleries, and halfway to Vermont. What a putt by Adam Scott! He's just raked in a monster 35-foot left-to-right slider on 2 to move back up to -8 and re-establish a three-shot lead! That's a stunning response to Rose's magnificent approach. Betraying no nerves, he calmly raises his right hand in the air and points a finger to the skies more in gentle satisfaction than any sort of excitable celebration. Mickelson plods off the green having only made a workaday par. Another birdie for Manassero, this time at 15. He's -4 for the day and -2 for the tournament. But disaster for Jason Day, who has double-bogeyed 4, dropping all the way down the leaderboard to -2. It's been a fairly miserable morning for the young Aussie after a stunning birdie-birdie start. By contrast, Rose started with a pair of bogeys, but he's on the upward march now, sending his approach at 2 right over the flag, the ball gripping and spinning back to a couple of inches. He'll tap that in for back-to-back birdies, and suddenly he'll be -2 for this tournament. He was all over the shop early on in his round, but there's a true spring in his step now. Simpson keeps on keepin' on. He's birdied 3 now, rising to -3 on the leaderboard. More intriguingly, at -5 for his round, he only needs one more birdie and he'll be on track to tie the competitive course record at Oak Hill East, held jointly by Ben Hogan (1942 Times-Union Open) and Curtis Strange (1989 US Open). The play's been hellishly slow, which is what's been allowing me to fanny about finding booze ads from the dark ages, as opposed to doing my job properly. It's not helping that the weather is bloody awful - the forecasters are chancers and charlatans, not much better than common footpads or highway robbers - and puddles are forming on tee boxes and the like. Anyway, after a long wait, Scott ambles up the 1st hole looking very pleased with himself, and no wonder. He's just ordered a Pabst Blue Ribbon found the centre of the green in regulation, then so nearly drained a Pabst Blue Ribbon birdie effort from 25 feet. He'll settle for par and remains at -7, two clear of Jim Furyk, who is yet to hit a ball in anger today. Mickelson three putts for bogey to drop back to +1, but better news for Rose, who rolls in a 20-footer for birdie to move back to -1. Matteo Manassero, after two early birdies, dropped a stroke at 7, but he's just snaffled another couple of shots at 11 and 13, and is -3 for the day, -1 for the tournament. Tim Clark has slipped backwards, though, with bogey at 3; he's level for the day and -1 alongside Manassero on the leaderboard. \"Well, here I am, trying to wean myself off the booze, bit of major tournament golf to help ease the pain,\" moans Simon McMahon. \"So I tune in to the HBH and what do I find? That's right, beer commercials. Now I'm on my third can.\" I wouldn't worry too much, I'm doing you a favour. According to the 1950s, the stuff makes you much more attractive to prospective sexual partners. This one, for example, argues that women will consider themselves \"romanced\" if you tersely order them to get you a tinnie. Oh darling, I love it when you drink your booze! Webb Simpson is unquestionably the man of the day so far. His relentless march up the leaderboard continues with birdie at 2, his fourth of the day in a round so far without blemish. He's -4 for the day and -2 for the tournament. Scott Piercy's round, by contrast, continues to unravel; he's dropped another shot at 13, and is now +1 for the day, -2 for the tournament. It was only a couple of hours ago when he had a share of the lead. Now he's five off the pace, Scott having just sashayed up 18 with no fuss whatsoever for par to remain at -7. Another bogey for Lee Westwood. He's dropped a shot at 2 now, and is back at -4. On whichever American network I'm currently suffering, putting guru and 1991 Open champ Ian Baker-Finch is explaining how he's trying to convince Westwood to keep his head still and stop looking anxiously after his short putts. A coin behind the ball in practice drills, which he keeps his eyes clapped onto after making the stroke. It's kind of working, I guess, but maybe they should progress to dollar bills or diamonds. Meanwhile Zach Johnson, after a series of pars, registers his first birdie of the day at 16. -7: Scott (8*) -5: Furyk -4: Day (12*), Westwood (11*), Kaymer (9*), Hearn Putting from distance, just off the front of the green, Scott lags up to five feet. That's a pretty good effort from there. But if there's one chink in his armour, it's that preposterous putter, and he pulls his short par putt left of the hole. That's not very good at all, yet another three putt, albeit one that technically won't go down as one seeing he was a couple of rolls off the green to start with. He'd done the hard work, too. He's back to -7. Rose, by contrast, gets up and down majestically from thick rough to the front-left of the green. Par, a score Mickelson manages to match from Scott Country - Scott Land? - at the front of the green. Scott wanders off with a grim look on his mug. Scott's up against it coming down 17, though, without doing too much wrong. It's playing 510 yards today - this is a par-four, remember - and despite finding the fairway with a restrained tee shot, accuracy having been at a premium, he can't quite reach the green in two. Mickelson and Rose are also both unable to make it all the way up. Scott and Lefty are, however, just off the front. The rain, incidentally, is coming down in sheets, though the report - and this one's worth listening to, so we're led to believe - suggests that within the hour the rain will pass for good, and there are no risks of electrical storms, so no delays today. We'll see, we'll see. Yep, in it goes. Scott now leads Westwood by three strokes. He's been the best and most consistent player in the world over the past 12 months, hasn't he, and I think that probably includes Tiger, for all the world number one's antics on the regular tour. His mental strength to bounce back from Lytham has been out of this world. Anyway, we're not even at the halfway stage, so he's got plenty of time to lose his mojo, but at the moment he's sauntering serenely around this track for a second day in a row. Golf isn't a game of perfect, as some publishing genius once said, but he's mighty close in this particular moment. Miguel Angel Jimenez is nothing if not entertaining. Yesterday's round saw him card five birdies in a row and two double bogeys. He's already birdied three holes today - and now he's just carded his second double of his second round. That's come at 17. He's two over today, and level par for the tournament. Meanwhile there's been a little bit of retrospective scoreboard jiggery pokery: turns out Kaymer had birdied 15 too. If that's the case, he's -4 for the tournament and only three off Scott's lead. Though for how long remains to be seen; Scott has just clattered his approach at 16 over the flag and biting to five feet. He's got an easy birdie putt for a three-stroke lead! News of former champions. Martin Kaymer didn't manage to pick up any shots on the relatively easy stretch between 10 and 15, but on the first of the difficult three closing par fours, he's made birdie. He's -3 for the tournament. Meanwhile Rory McIlroy - technically reigning rather than former, but we may as well get a jump on - has double bogeyed 15, fannying around in a bunker and three putting. He's +1 for the tournament now, a sickener seeing he'd just birdied 14. Mickelson's downhill birdie tickler slides by on the left, and he stays at level par for the tournament. He's still a long way behind his playing partner Scott, so he'll be happy to see the leader prod in a highly uncertain fashion at his short birdie effort and miss it on the low side. Here's the very top of the leaderboard, which still features Jason Day, but only just, the Aussie having shed a shot at 18: -7: Scott (6*) -5: Westwood (8*), Furyk -4: Day (9*), Hearn Scott guides a delicate 7-iron into 15, the ball bouncing off the downslope behind a bunker at the front and rolling to six feet. Mickelson matches the leader for artistry, though opting to use the bank to the left of the green, the slope gathering his ball round to ten feet. Rose wasn't far off a similar result either, but his ball decided to snag in the rough just by the green instead. Unlucky. That putt could give Scott quite the healthy lead at the top of the leaderboard, because Westwood has just dropped a shot at the long par-four 17th - the hardest hole on the course so far this week - to slip back to -5. The biggest mover today has been Webb Simpson, who has currently shot 52 places up the leaderboard to -1. He's the only player out there at -3 for his round today, with birdies at 10, 11 and 14, and is -1 for the tournament. Meanwhile our major champs are making, if not a meal, then at least a tasting menu of 14. With the rain tipping down again - so much for the prediction of no more rain - Scott fizzes his second straight through the green then races his birdie putt from the apron six feet past the hole. Par. Mickelson makes the edge of the green with his second, then skelps his long birdie effort eight feet past. He knocks in his par too. Rose meanwhile hits an extremely average chip onto the green, 15 feet from the hole - then strokes in the birdie effort! He's back to -1. That all appeared a lot tougher than it really needed to be. Scott drives into verdant nonsense in front of 14. Mickelson pushes an iron into thicker rubbish to the right. Rose nearly reaches the green, but his ball rolls off to the left into the rough. But if you don't somehow guide a drive onto the putting surface, that's the place they all want to be. Scott Piercy, meanwhile, had a share of the lead after three birdies on the bounce this morning, but he's just dropped his third shot of the day at 9. It means he's reached the turn in 35 strokes, level for the day, and -3 again for the tournament. Meanwhile Miguel Angel Jimenez has recovered very well indeed after his awful start, with birdies at 14 and 15 which bring him back to level par for the day and -2 overall. Anyway, Scott's got the sole lead again; he's at -7. Meanwhile Mickelson makes his birdie and he's back to level par. Rose, well, nothing's happening for him. He remains at level par too, after a fairly dismal run at the hole for his birdie effort stopped well short. The three major champs trudge up to the 14th tee box, where they wait for the group ahead to finish off, the green at the par-four reachable to those giving the ball a sturdy clack. Mickelson asks Scott if he can have the honour, despite it belonging to the Australian, as unlike the young whippersnapper he's not going to be reaching the green. No driver in his bag, for a start. But Scott talks him out of it, suggesting that the players up on the green may be unnerved if they hear one of Lefty's balls slapping down on the lush fairway turf behind them. We wait. Scott dribbles in the most ridiculous downhill birdie putt on 13! He tinkles it out to the right, the ball drifts at glacial pace across the line to the left, and just as it looks like missing on that side, kinks back in to the right and drops into the hole using up the ball's last micro-joule of energy. That was strangely exciting, given the pace of the action was not dissimilar to this particular Constanzian farce: The rain seems to have eased off. The umbrellas are down. The suggestion is that there will be no more of the stuff today. Mickelson, Scott and Rose all lay up at 13, as we knew they would; it's a bit of a non-event, this par five, with all players carefully nudging their way down it in regulation. Mickelson does his best to raise the pulse by knocking his wedge to three feet. He should make birdie to move back to level par. Rose and Scott both have makeable birdie chances from 15 feet. Mickelson showcases environmentally sound credentials on the 13th by picking up a broken tee from the turf and re-using it, rather than pulling out a fresh one. He's rewarded for his green ethics when his shot splits the fairway. Scott and Rose also clip their tee shots down the track. Westwood's rise to the top of the leaderboard apart, it's been a fairly slow morning so far. Plenty of time left yet. Mickelson's not far from raking in a 35-foot birdie effort, but nothing's quite catching fire for Lefty this week. Par. Rose goes close from 15 feet, but the US Open champ isn't quite on his game yet today. Par. And it's three pars for the group, Scott unable to make his birdie effort, which was something of a shame seeing he'd done marvellously well to get his ball so close having found rough down the right of the hole with an errant tee shot. Our major-winning trio don't exactly pepper the pin with their approaches to the short par-four 12th, but all three give themselves half a chance of birdie. Scott will need to knock in his 12-footer if he wants to retain the sole lead, because Lee Westwood has just made birdie at the equally short par-four 14th, his second of the day and one which moves him to -6 alongside the Masters champion. A birdie for Tim Clark at 13, the South African moving to -2 alongside Martin Kaymer, who has started out with three steady pars. Darren Clarke dropped the shot he picked up on 13 at the very next hole. He's level par today and -1 for the tournament. And it's been a strong start from the young Italian prospect Matteo Manassero, who birdied 4 and has now picked up another at 6, moving up to level par for the tournament. The marquee group is up and running again. Mickelson finds himself scrambling once more, this time from a bunker at the par-three 11th, but he can't splash out close. No matter, he crisply holes the ten-footer to remain at +1, a second successful up-and-down already today. Scott nearly drains a birdie putt from 35 feet. Par. And Rose attempts to turns the tide by rattling in a birdie effort from 20 feet, but the ball sails six feet past. His return putt lips out, and the three-putt means he's made back-to-back bogeys. He's level par all of a sudden. The play is pretty slow along the back nine at the moment. An awful lot of hanging around going on, and not much else. May as well get the on-the-hour leaderboard thing going on ... -6: Scott (1*) -5: Day (4*), Westwood (4*), Furyk -4: Piercy (7), Hearn -3: Garrigus, Casey, Kuchar, Fraser ... and take the opportunity afforded by the pause in play to point out, in the interests of balance, that other hop-based beverages are available, and not just the ones brewed on the banks of the Genesee. For example, here's one produced by Bob Hope Industries: Another dropped shot for Jimenez, and the wheels are really clunking off the Mechanic's bandwagon. Bogey at 12 brings him back to level par. Last year's US Open champion Webb Simpson is moving the other way; he's up to level par after birdies at 10 and 11. And a second bogey of the day for erstwhile co-leader Scott Piercy, who drops a shot at 7 to move back to -4. He's only parred two holes so far today. The scoring at this championship has been - if you'll excuse the nod to the current weather - rather fluid so far. The weather's pretty damn dismal at Oak Hill. It shouldn't cause the players too many problems - it's wet, rather than particularly windy, which will at least tame the course a bit - but the players going out in the afternoon are expected to have the better of the conditions as the sun eventually peeks out from behind the clouds. Whether the greens hold up as the day goes on is another issue altogether; they became pretty bumpy and tatty during the latter stages of the first round. Rose can't make his par putt, racing it a good five feet past the hole. He knocks in the return, but that's a miserable start. He was always playing catch-up after whistling his tee shot into a bunker. The defending champ Rory McIlroy has already bogeyed this hole, incidentally, and has dropped back to level par for the championship. The major-winning marquee group is out. They're going down 10, and nobody's reached the green in regulation, Scott, Rose and Mickelson all finding trouble from the tee down the left. Rose gives himself half a chance of saving his par with a decent wedge into the green after laying up out of a bunker. Mickelson should certainly save his par after sending a bump and run to 18 inches. But Scott, from the rough at the front of the green, fancies a birdie. The flag's removed, and he rolls a delicious chip right into the centre of the cup! That was in all the way, from the second it left the face of his wedge! He's now the sole leader at -6! Piercy's clearly in the mood today. He dropped a shot at 1, but has just made three birdies in a row, 4 through 6, to join the leaders at -5. Also moving in an agreeable direction is Lee Westwood, who catches up with Piercy et al after a birdie at 12. Jimenez, however, has just doubled 11 to drop back to -1. All of a sudden, the top of the leaderboard has this FLAVOR: -5: Piercy (6), Day (3*), Westwood (3*), Scott, Furyk -4: Hearn -3: Garrigus, Casey, Kuchar, Fraser Anyway, an early-morning manoeuvre so predictable you could have set your watch by it: Jason Day has flown out of the traps like a greyhound equipped with a fully functioning set of wings. He's birdied 10 and 12, and is now the joint leader of the tournament alongside Adam Scott, who will be out in a minute, and Jim Furyk, who is presumably still in bed dreaming of octopi. There are other signs that Oak Hill will serve up a low score if someone wants it, not least because it's tipping down and the course will be friendly and soft: Scott Piercy is -1 for the day through five holes and a shot behind at -4, while superannuated Europeans Miguel Angel Jimenez and Darren Clarke have both picked up early shots, and stand at -3 and -2 respectively. Ahead of today's action, let's add a little local flavour - or flavor - with this nod to a tasty product familiar to those born on the banks of the nearby Genessee river. It's so sad to see Captain Birdseye like this, isn't it. But this is what happens if you move Stateside and, inevitably, get hooked on booze and the demon chowder. The gums inflame, the pulse races, and it becomes almost impossible to talk and serve soup at the same time. There were scores out there at Oak Hill yesterday, for those who could avoid the penal rough. And lo, 35 of the 156-strong field shot rounds under par: -5: Furyk, Scott -4: Hearn, Westwood -3: Garrigus, Casey, Kuchar, Fraser, Piercy, Day -2: Aphibarnrat, Stricker, Dufner, Haas, Stenson, Cabrera-Bello, Blixt, Castro, Jimenez, Kaymer, Rose -1: Hoffman, Horschel, Gainey, Garcia, Bradley, Lynn, Jamieson, Ishikawa, Clarke, Clark, Moore, McIlroy, Austin, Z Johnson The big two of Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson couldn't manage one, though. They both probably should have: Tiger's putter turned on him during the latter part of his round, his mood and patience going south as a result, while Lefty conducted a questionable physics experiment going up the last, seeing whether he could pass his solid ball through a very solid tree. Nevertheless, at +1, neither are jiggered yet. Jim Furyk and Adam Scott posted the rounds of the day, a pair of 65s, while David Hearn and Lee Westwood tucked in behind them with very solid 66s. The course is still soft enough to offer up some more low scores; if any of the leading pack can post a second sub-70 round, they'll be in a strong position for the weekend, when Oak Hill is expected to toughen up a wee bit as the weather gets drier.
