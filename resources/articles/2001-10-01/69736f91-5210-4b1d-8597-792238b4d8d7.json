With the increasing prospect of almost as many years in retirement as we've spent at work, our priority becomes the need to ensure that we'll have enough money to enable us to enjoy those years in relative comfort. Increasingly retirees want to pursue an active life - and that costs money. And for the soon-to-be-retired baby boomer generation, with their higher lifestyle aspirations, that trend is likely to escalate as they will need far more money when they stop work than previous generations. Achieving that needs careful financial planning to build and protect capital, which can then be turned to income to finance our retirement years. That applies more than ever in the current economic environment, with falling returns on traditional investments. And it doesn't end there - we all need to constantly review our financial affairs as we grow older. But, while money will be the first priority, we'll also need to focus on the changes in lifestyle which our departure from the workplace will trigger. When hard at work the prospect of all that free time on our hands may indeed be very appealing. But for many the novelty soon wears off, with some unable to cope with the sudden change. Some will want to keep working and may well have to - to boost their income - while others may want to set up their own business. That can't happen overnight; you need to pursue the openings available ahead of retirement to achieve a smooth transition if you're to capitalise on your new-found freedom. As the aim of this new column is to focus on the wide range of topics affecting the over 50s, I would welcome hearing from readers in this age group about the issues which concern them. I'm also interested in hearing from those who feel that their experiences may inspire others to make the most of their retirement. \u0095 You can get in touch by writing to me at the Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER or by emailing me at margaret.hughes@theguardian.com, Please send copies of any relevant documents and include a daytime phone number."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
