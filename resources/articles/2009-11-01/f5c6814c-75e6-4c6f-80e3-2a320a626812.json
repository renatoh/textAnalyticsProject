He was convicted in 2002 of involvement in the killing of four Israelis and a Greek Orthodox monk, but is seen as a potential leader by many Palestinians. Barghouti is a fluent Hebrew-speaker who has supported peace talks with Israel but was also a prominent figure early in the second intifada, the Palestinian uprising that began in late 2000. There are other senior figures in Fatah who might want to run, such as Mohammad Dahlan, but they do not have the same popular following. Likewise Salam Fayyad, the prime minister who is not a Fatah member, might want to run but he too does not have a widespread public following. If Hamas, the Islamist movement, agrees with Fatah to reconcile and to hold elections it too might put up a presidential candidate, probably Ismail Haniyeh, the deposed prime minister. He would probably not poll enough votes to win, but Hamas might see Haniyeh's candidacy as one way of trying to generate international legitimacy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
