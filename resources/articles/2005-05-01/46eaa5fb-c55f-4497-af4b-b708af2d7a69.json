United confirmed they had signed the 18-year-old from the Norwegian club Lyn Oslo almost three weeks ago, since when Mikel has been taken to London by his agent John Shittu and appeared on television to claim he did not want to go to Old Trafford but was placed under intolerable pressure by United officials. Mikel has said he wants to join Chelsea. The claim has been denied by United, with their assistant manager Carlos Queiroz hinting that Mikel's mind had been changed for him. Shittu denies any wrong-doing and claims the equivalent of \u00a34,600 handed on to the player's father was to sort out a \"family emergency\" rather than to persuade the player to sign a management contract with him, as has been alleged in some quarters. The Nigerian Football Association chairman Ibrahim Galadima said: \"I am very concerned about the controversy surrounding this young player.\" - PA \u00b7 Graham Poll will referee tomorrow's Uefa Cup final between Sporting Lisbon and CSKA Moscow.
