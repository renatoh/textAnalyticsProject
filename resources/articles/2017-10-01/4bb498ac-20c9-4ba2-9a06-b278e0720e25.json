Available at 12-1 on Friday, Withhold showed enough quality for a race like this with a couple of wins at the end of last year and his prep run last month was most encouraging. Sold off by Khalid Abdullah last October, Withhold was knocked down to Tony Bloom, professional gambler and the Brighton and Hove Albion chairman, and it seems likely that this race has been the target from that moment. On his previous start before that sale he beat the useful London Prize and now meets that rival on 8lb better terms. The cheekpieces he wore that day for the first time are now back on, having been left off when he was third over too short a distance last month. He is not well drawn but is partnered by Silvestre de Sousa, who has twice won this race from difficult berths. Snow Falcon looks a danger while Star Rider might be the each-way value at 66-1 or so. 1.50 Newmarket Cheekpieces also seem to have helped Westerland and John Gosden\u2019s charge is a lively outsider in this Listed contest. 2.05 York A staying-on fourth in the Cambridgeshire, Chelsea Lad has a big chance in this longer race. 2.25 Newmarket Gosden and Frankie Dettori could follow up with Purser, who met trouble in Sandown\u2019s Solario, his only defeat so far. 2.40 York The heavy favourite, Shabaaby, has the standout form and promises to be better yet. 3.00 Newmarket Expert Eye looked all class at Goodwood and that form has worked out but it is two months since he has been seen and his stable is no longer in such dominant form. The dour but progressive US Navy Flag should relish this belated step up in distance and, as a prominent racer, might be able to bag the favoured stands rail by halfway. His three stablemates from Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s yard will be among the obstacles Expert Eye must overcome. 3.15 York This looks easier than most of the tasks Raucous, available at 18-1, has faced this year.
