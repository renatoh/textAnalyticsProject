He\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d purred the West Ham United manager after his captain\u2019s emphatic volley 11 minutes from time sealed a professional victory over West Bromwich Albion. \u201cI was an international coach for six years and the national team is not about the 23 best players in one country. It\u2019s also a team, especially in the big tournaments where they are together for six weeks. It needs atmosphere and everything \u2013 stars and lesser stars and all that. Is he a top-quality player? Of course. Not only today because he scored a couple of goals. It\u2019s every day, every game, every training session. He is top class. Mark is a great person also. He\u2019s playing great. He could help England.\u201d Bilic could have a point. Roy Hodgson\u2019s reluctance to pick a midfielder who has now scored four goals in his last two games as West Ham have revived their push for a place in Europe next season is probably more down to loyalty to others than anything else. Yet as his club ensured they remain in touch with both Manchester clubs after a clinical away victory sparked by Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9\u2019s header, Noble showed signs he could make the transition with ease. \u201cI\u2019m just enjoying my football,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cIt\u2019s really gone well this season and I am playing a bit further forward. We\u2019ve got some really big clubs around challenging for the same thing so we\u2019ve got to keep winning games. We have Swansea at home and then United which is going to be an emotional occasion, followed by Stoke away to end it.\u201d Noble added: \u201cWe are setting standards every day and working hard for each other. We have a good bunch of players and good staff who keep us all on our toes. That\u2019s what you need.\u201d Bilic, who could be seen blowing Noble a kiss from the dugout after his second goal from Andy Carroll\u2019s cross, admitted he is delighted West Ham have now achieved their best Premier League points\u2019 total \u2013 wherever they end up finishing. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie and say it doesn\u2019t mean anything \u2013 of course it does. It\u2019s proof that the boys are doing a good job and long may it continue.\u201d Following West Brom\u2019s heroics against Tottenham last week their supporters were left frustrated as the home side failed to take their chances in the first half and were made to pay. The teenage forward Jonathan Leko was at the heart of their best moments on his full debut and he said Tony Pulls had chosen an unlikely place to inform him that he was in the team. \u201cI was in the toilet and the gaffer called me out and said: \u2018You\u2019re starting,\u2019 and I was like: \u2018What?\u2019\u201d the 17-year-old said. \u201cI was ready to go and was ready to start. I didn\u2019t like to think about pressure, I was concentrating on the game and ready to go. I liked it, . It was a bit of a surprise.\u201d Leko is the first player born in 1999 to play in the Premier League and he said he was grateful for the chance to set that particular record. \u201cIt\u2019s a good stat, hopefully I can kick on. It was a good experience for me.\u201d An underwhelming season at The Hawthorns has prompted the West Brom chairman, Jeremy Peace, to appoint Nicky Hammond as the club\u2019s new technical director. Given his previous reluctance to share his managerial duties Pulis may have considered this is as a slight, but he insisted that he has no qualms resuming a similar relationship to that he once shared with John Rudge. \u201cI worked with a technical director or director of football at Stoke for 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cNicky is a lot younger than Rudgy and I am hoping he will be a lot more free with his money so he can buy me a drink now and then, unlike what Rudgy did.\u201d Man of the match Mark Noble (West Ham)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
