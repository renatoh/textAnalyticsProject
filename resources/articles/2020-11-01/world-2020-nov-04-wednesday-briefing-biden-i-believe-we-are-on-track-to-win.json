Enhance your calm and let\u2019s take this one thing at a time. With polls closed and counting under way in the US presidential election, Joe Biden spoke in Delaware a short time ago and declared: \u201cWe feel good about where we are \u2026 we believe we are on track to win this election.\u201d While Biden took the stage before supporters, Donald Trump was fuming on Twitter that \u201cWe are up BIG but they are trying to STEAL the Election\u201d, adding somewhat bewilderingly that votes cannot be cast after \u201cpoles\u201d (sic) have closed. Twitter promptly masked the tweet with a warning that it may be misleading about the election. Here is a round-up of the big developments and you can see at our live results page where things are at right now in the race for the states and their electoral college votes. Different news outlets \u201ccall\u201d the state results in different ways, at different times \u2013 we go with the Associated Press assessment. Stick around the Guardian today because our live blog and smorgasbord of other reporting on the US election will continue to provide compelling reading. With voting done and dusted \u2013 but those votes still being counted, which is entirely normal and legal \u2013 the US may be facing a drawn-out fight for the White House. Democratic hopes of a landslide for Joe Biden over Donald Trump were tempered with the president winning Florida \u2013 a state he needs to stay in office. The \u201crust belt\u201d states, just at this point, look pivotal to Biden\u2019s chances. Biden said in Wilmington: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to be patient until the hard work of tallying votes is finished.\u201d He was \u201cconfident\u201d about winning Arizona, which went Republican last time, and \u201cstill in the game in Georgia \u2026 we\u2019re feeling real good about Wisconsin and Michigan. And by the way it\u2019s going to take time to count the votes, but we\u2019re going to win Pennsylvania.\u201d Biden said a result may come as early as Wednesday morning US time \u201cor it could take longer\u201d. It was \u201cnot my place or Donald Trump\u2019s place\u201d to call the final result. He finished with a rallying cry: \u201cKeep the faith guys, we\u2019re gonna win this.\u201d Voting day itself appeared to pass off smoothly, though fears of subsequent unrest prompted boarding up of shops in places like Washington, New York and Raleigh, North Carolina. As Julian Borger writes, \u201cdowntown Washington on election day had the feel of a city digging in for a siege. The White House and the Treasury were surrounded by a high steel fence and in the surrounding blocks, businesses and apartment buildings had covered every square foot of exposed glass with plywood\u201d. Democrats have held on to the House of Representatives and all eyes are on whether they can win control of the Senate \u2013 crucial to either allowing a Biden presidency to prosecute its agenda, or keeping a second Trump administration in check. In a worrying sign of the times, a supporter of the bizarre, utterly false QAnon online conspiracy theory, has won a seat in the House for the Republicans. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, two members of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d of Democratic congresswomen of colour, led the way in securing re-election to the US House on Tuesday. * * * Pints but no protests \u2013 Pubs in England will be able to serve takeaway beer as long as it\u2019s pre-ordered by phone or online. The rules for England\u2019s lockdown beginning tomorrow also state which stores can remain open \u2013 apart from essential outlets like food shops and pharmacies, they include the likes of garden centres, outdoor food stalls, pet shops, hardware and bicycle stores. An exemption allowing protests to take place is expected to be removed from the rules, which has angered human rights and other campaign groups. We unpack the rules and their quirks here. Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, has condemned the dubious \u201cGreat Barrington declaration\u201d that calls for Covid to be let run wild in the young and healthy to bring about so-called \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Penny Mordaunt, a senior Tory minister, has told parliament the UK should be braced for at least a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic and further lockdowns. Ministers expect a moderate number of Conservative MPs to rebel but Labour support means the measures are guaranteed to be voted into force today.

Police have said there was only one gunman in Vienna: the man they killed, Kujtim Fejzulai, 20, a jihadist who had pretended to be deradicalised after his arrest and jailing for trying to join Isis in Syria. Four people were killed in the Vienna attack, 22 others were injured including three critically, and police said they detained 14 people for questioning. * * * \u2018Spy cops\u2019 judge\u2019s demand \u2013 The head of the newly opened inquiry into undercover policing has insisted that in the course of the proceedings Scotland Yard must reveal whether it currently has spies in political groups. In an opening statement the Met\u2019s barrister, Peter Skelton accepted undercover officers had caused \u201cimmense hurt\u201d to women deceived into relationships and distress to families whose dead relatives\u2019 identities were used. Oliver Sanders, barrister for 113 undercover officers, sought to play down the significance of the relationships his clients formed and said using the identities of dead children was \u201cnecessary tradecraft\u201d in the security, intelligence and law enforcement community. \u201c[The officers] proceeded on the basis that there was no alternative and the families of the deceased children in question would never know.\u201d Today in Focus podcast \u2026 in the circumstances will be coming to you a bit later this morning, to fit in as much of the latest election info as possible.
