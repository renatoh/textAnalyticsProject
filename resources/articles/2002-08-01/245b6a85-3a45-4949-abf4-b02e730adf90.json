The world record holder for the 100 metres claimed yesterday that a row with his long-time shoe sponsors Nike, combined with the death of two close family members, contributed to him losing motivation during the winter and not resuming full training until February after several months away from the track. \"I had a couple of deaths in the family - my grandmother and uncle, who I was very close to, passed away - and I was also having problems with my shoe company and my mind just wasn't in the right order,\" said Greene, who competes in the British grand prix at Crystal Palace on Friday. \"There was a point when I thought 'what am I doing this for?'\" As the world and Olympic champion, Greene said he expected to be treated with more respect by Nike when his contract came up for renewal in December. The company, whose swoosh logo is among the most recognisable on the planet, offered him less than half of the $1m (\u00a3650,000) he asked for and also refused to name a line of shoes in his honour. But what made it particularly upsetting for Greene, his agent Emmanuel Hudson claimed, was that Nike had agreed to name a shoe after Bob Kennedy, the world's 41st-ranked 5,000m runner in 2001. His main claim to fame is that he was the first white man to break 13 minutes for 5,000m. Greene signed with Nike's main rivals Adidas in May and they plan to launch soon a \"Mo Greene\" line of signature clothing and footwear. \"I felt deeply hurt and let down by Nike, who I had been with since 1994,\" said Greene. \"I thought 'what's the point?' It was very painful. I thought we were closer than that. I didn't see it coming.\" Nike responded in regretful tones. \"To suggest Nike did not treat him in the proper manner is categorically incorrect,\" said Beth Hedge, a company spokeswoman. \"It's unfortunate Maurice feels this way about Nike but we continue to wish him well.\" Nike sponsor some of the world's leading sportsmen and women, including Tiger Woods, Lance Armstrong, Marion Jones and Paula Radcliffe, but this is not the first occasion they have been accused of treating the world's fastest man poorly. Carl Lewis left the company after his four gold medals at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 because he said he was not receiving the respect he believed he deserved. He later rejoined Nike and still acts as a spokesman for them. Britain's Kelly Holmes also left Nike after they made what she claimed was \"a derisory offer\" following her bronze medal in the 800m at the 2000 Olympics. Several industry analysts are not convinced, however, that backing such big names translates into long-term sales or boosted stock prices. They believe Nike's new product lines themselves, not famous athletes' exploits, attract more consumers. Greene has suffered his worst season since establishing himself as the world No1 in 1997 and has been beaten in his past three races by Britain's Dwain Chambers, including in Zurich last Friday when he finished only fifth. Ironically, one of the reasons he gave for his poor performance was that his new Adidas spikes fell apart during the race. \"This year has been very trying for me,\" said Greene. \"I have gone through a lot. That's why my season has been so up and down. Now I want to keep running fast and, if I can stay healthy, that's the most important thing. Then I can start gearing up for next year and the world championships. \"I still feel I have a 9.8 in me before the season ends. If I was running 9.85 and losing then I would have a problem. But I'm not. I'm running 10.00 and losing. Judge a person on how they come back: just watch me.\" Famous footwear Air Jordan Michael Jordan - US basketball player Agassi Tennis collection Andre Agassi - US tennis player Tiger Golf Collection Tiger Woods - US golfer Air Pippen Scottie Pippen - US basketball player Air Payton IV Gary Payton - US basketball player Nike Shox VC Vince Carter - US basketball player Zoom Kennedy spikes Bob Kennedy - US distance runner Zoom JSC spikes Michael Johnson - US track athlete Air Griffey Max Ken Griffey Jr - US baseball player Shox Marshall Faulk XT Marshall Faulk - American football player"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
