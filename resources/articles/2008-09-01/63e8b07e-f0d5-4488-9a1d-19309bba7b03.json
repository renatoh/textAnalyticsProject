There is no mention of the Guggenheim Bilbao or Ibiza rave culture: for this is the Spain of Gypsies, bullfights, orange groves and castanets. It is a place where young women look demure in frilly tops and men strut in bolero jackets, a place where the industrial revolution never happened, where Franco is still all-powerful. If its function as a frozen historical snapshot is one reason why Spain is interesting, another is its role as poetic historical guidebook. Condensing a remarkable range of history into its 155 pages, including descriptions of monarch Joan the Mad, Moorish occupations and giddy imperial ransacking, Spain is written in non-linear fashion, with every chapter starting from a different part of the country and exploring the genealogy of particular features (such as religion or water). A good read for the curious holidaymaker or for anyone susceptible to \"the contagion of Spain\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
