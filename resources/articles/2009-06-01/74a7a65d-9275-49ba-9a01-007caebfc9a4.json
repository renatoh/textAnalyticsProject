Yesterday Jimmy Fortune replaced Jamie Spencer on Delegator in the St James's Palace Stakes, following the news that the apprentice Ahmed Ajtebi will ride Gladiatorus, favourite for the Queen Anne Stakes, and not Frankie Dettori, for Godolphin. \"We just fancied a change and that's all it is,\" said Poilin Good, the owner of Delegator, yesterday. Spencer finished second on the Brian Meehan-trained colt in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, but trailed in second-last on Delegator in the Irish equivalent, run on testing ground. \"The horse worked very well this morning and it is now up to Brian whether he runs next week,\" said Good. \"Obviously the conditions were atrocious when he ran in Ireland.\" Simon Crisford, the racing manager to Godolphin, said yesterday it was \"no reflection\" on the former champion jockey that Ajtebi would ride Gladiatorus, favourite for the big race on Tuesday, with Dettori on the stable companion Alexandros, a general 10-1 shot. Sheikh Mohammed is clearly keen to encourage Ajtebi, a fellow Dubaian, who rode Gladiatorus to victory in the Dubai Duty Free at Nad Al Sheba in March. \"I said back in May that it was likely Ahmed would get the ride over here,\" added Crisford. \"Frankie is stable jockey. This only came about because he [Ajtebi] got on so well with Gladiatorus.\" Ajtebi said: \"When you get chances like this as a jockey, it makes you very happy. He is dropping in trip from the Duty Free but he broke the track record over a mile and has the speed for Group One level.\" The bookmakers are not expecting Dettori to have a vintage meeting and William Hill, who have opened betting on the top jockey at Royal Ascot, rate him a 14-1 chance with Ryan Moore their 5-4 favourite. They also bet: 3-1 Johnny Murtagh, 11-2 Richard Hughes and 16-1 Richard Hills and Jimmy Fortune. Matt Gingell, the former trainer who was found guilty of a doping offence involving sodium bicarbonate, known as \"milkshaking\", was yesterday disqualified for two years at a British Horseracing Authority inquiry and ordered to pay \u00a32,500 towards costs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
