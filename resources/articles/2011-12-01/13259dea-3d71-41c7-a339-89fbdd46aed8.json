The church, the most influential within Scotland, has added its weight to a growing backlash against same-sex marriage by religious groups. It claimed that allowing gay marriages contradicted the fundamental and historical basis of the institution. Its intervention is a further blow to Alex Salmond's government, and follows the launch on Wednesday outside the Scottish parliament of a new multi-faith campaign against the reform called Scotland for Marriage led by Scotland's most senior Catholic, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, and a senior Church of Scotland figure, Ann Allen. The Catholic church, many senior Muslim figures and evangelical churches have now formally opposed the proposal, while a grouping of smaller churches, including liberal Jewish groups, Quakers, the Scottish Pagan Federation and Unitarians, have supported the measure. Nicola Sturgeon, the deputy first minister and Scottish health secretary, said, however, that her government was likely to press on with the reforms. She said ministers still \"tended towards their initial view\" that the changes were needed. The Scottish National party attempted to placate its critics by again insisting that no church or minister would be forced by law to conduct a gay marriage against their will or conscience. It said no final decision had been made, but added there was \"support for same-sex marriage across the political parties, and a range of views within parties. The Scottish government is clear that, whatever the way forward, faith groups and their celebrants should not be obliged to solemnise same sex marriages.\" The latest Scottish social attitudes survey found that 60% of Scots agreed with gay men and lesbians have equal marriage rights, against 19% who opposed it. Sturgeon was backed by Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader. \"I find it difficult to fathom why the Church of Scotland seeks to impose its view on the whole of society when we do not seek to impose our views on it,\" he said. The Church of Scotland hinted strongly it could find room to compromise, carefully stating that its opposition was based on the issue \"as matters currently stand\". It implied that it could shift its stance if far more detailed research was taken on redefining marriage. \"The church believes that much more measured consideration is required before the understanding of marriage, which is entrenched and valued within the culture of Scotland, both secular and religious, is surrendered to accommodate this wish,\" it said. The Church of Scotland's rejection comes against the background of a deep internal rift over its moves to allow the full ordination of gay ministers. The church is expected to fully endorse gay clergy in 2013, but is trying to head off a major revolt that could see up to 150 ministers leaving the church in protest. In its response to the gay marriage consultation, the church insisted it rejected homophobia in all its forms, but senior church sources say they believe the Scottish government had seriously mishandled the issue. It had failed to consult with religious groups before publishing its proposals. That made it far harder to resist opponents of same-sex marriage and had undermined efforts by liberals in the church to find a compromise, perhaps by allowing individual ministers to choose to conduct same-sex marriages. In its statement, the Church of Scotland said: \"In common with the historic position of the Christian Church, the Church of Scotland has always viewed marriage as being between one man and one woman. \"Scriptural references to marriage, whether literal or metaphorical, all operate under this understanding. To redefine marriage to include same-sex marriage may have significant and, as yet, inadequately considered repercussions for our country, for the well-being of families, communities and individuals.\" Reverend Scott Rennie, the gay minister at Aberdeen's Queen's Cross Church, whose ordination sparked off the church's rift over gay ordination, said he was disappointed. \"While the Kirk may not yet be in a position to celebrate equal marriage itself, it is disappointing that it has used its voice to deny the possibility to any other religious community,\" he said. \"It seems there is still a long way to go before gay people, and their loving relationships, are valued by the Church of Scotland.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 6 December 2011.
