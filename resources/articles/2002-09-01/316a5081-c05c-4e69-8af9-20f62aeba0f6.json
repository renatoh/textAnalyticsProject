Not for the first time on Saturday they must have been feeling mighty glad he found his way. Sonko, for all that he seems to run in slow motion, still got to the ball ahead of Dean Crowe and Steve Howard on almost every occasion. Now he has an offer on the table from Brentford and his agent has taken calls from Millwall and Reading. Is Brentford's Wally Downes still hoping to keep him? \"Yes,\" said Downes but shook his head. \"I've stopped worrying about that now. Every day he comes in and plays for us is a bonus.\" Sonko's team-mates beckoned frantically for the centre-back to run up for set pieces (they had 10 corners in the first 35 minutes) but Brentford's closest chances fell to Eddie Hutchinson and Mark McCammon - the last of which ended fittingly with him on his bottom and the ball sailing over to the sound of the final whistle. That sight marked Luton's third game without defeat after a poor opening run that had seen them \"missing them for fun one end and giving them away the other\", according to Joe Kinnear. Saturday saw no such excesses in either direction. Howard came closer than any one when a header sprung out from the underside of the bar before half-time. But for the most part Luton got only the wrong kinds of touches, the ball pinging off knees, backs and behinds before finding its way up into the air again. Luton showed more pace in the second half but not to greater purpose. Paul Hughes twice broke away half the length of the field late on but his runs resulted in nothing more penetrating than the Benny Hill theme tune. The greatest flamboyance was displayed by Downes when the Nationwide manager of the month entered the press conference in double-breasted pinstripes and suede shoes. \"Another point gained,\" he smiled, smoothing his tie and tapping his toes. Man of the match: Ibrahami Sonko (Brentford)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
