You should know that the April scroll is being edited, by me, and that the book will include a critical introduction correcting the regrettably widely held idea that the novel was written in a three-week \"Benzedrine-fuelled frenzy\". Kerouac had been planning and making notes towards the novel for at least three years prior to April 1951, and while he certainly used Benzedrine at times to sustain him during the long writing stints he favoured after the creative breakthrough he experienced in 1951, he did not use it to write the scroll manuscript of On the Road. \"I wrote that book on COFFEE,\" he told Neal Cassady, \"remember said rule. Benny, tea, anything I KNOW none as good as coffee for real mental power kicks.\" The myth that the book was simply an unmediated confession channelled by Kerouac in a drug \"frenzy\" is one that inflates a legend while neglecting a writer whose work, as Ann Douglas has written, \"represents the most extensive experiment in language and literary form undertaken by an American writer of his generation\". Howard Cunnell London Royal blush Billy Bragg's review (\"After Elizabeth\", October 14) was almost as disappointing as \"professional rottweiler\" Jeremy Paxman's nervousness in the presence of Elizabeth Windsor. He kept to much of the same territory outlined in Paxman's book and in the film The Queen where Her Maj has been reinvented as a supreme moral arbiter between her own Ruritanian household, the Government and Highgrove House. Only at the end does Bragg mention the constitutional anomaly that the revolution of 1688 failed to resolve - the residual political power of the monarchy. However, he conspicuously failed to explore one of the main objections to the monarchy - that of hereditary succession, as Tom Paine wrote \"as absurd as an hereditary mathematician, or an hereditary wise man\". Have years of rural isolation blunted Billy's radical edge? Richard Knights Liverpool Sleuthing out the prize Your review of Benjamin Black's (aka John Banville's) Christine Falls (\"Dark deeds in Dublin\", October 7) suggests that it is good enough to win the Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger. However excellent the book, it cannot win something that no longer exists - but it could be a contender for the Duncan Lawrie Dagger, which is what the award is now called. Should it win, Mr Black (or Mr Banville) would receive a cheque for \u00a320,000, the biggest prize in the world for crime fiction. Robert Richardson Chair, Crime Writers' Association A larger canvas To suggest that C\u00e9zanne was unknown to the art world before English writers spread the news is a curiously Anglocentric view (James Wood, \"A fresh view\", September 30). C\u00e9zanne was always an artist's artist. He exhibited at the first and third Salons des Refus\u00e9s of 1874 and 1877, and worked with Renoir at L'Estaque during the 1880s. In 1883 Gauguin bought one of his works from Tanguy, which he later refused to sell in spite of his financial problems; C\u00e9zanne had become a source of inspiration. French dealers were buying C\u00e9zanne's work during the last three decades of the 19th century, and by 1895 he was beginning to be recognised internationally. I was fortunate to have seen the Folkwang Museum's superb exhibition in Essen in 2004-05 entitled C\u00e9zanne and the Dawn of Modern Art, which brought together more than 100 works from galleries across the globe, and showed his influence on nine recognised modern painters by juxtaposing their works with his. On the evidence of this exhibition, which included works by him from the Hermitage and Pushkin museums as well as several US collections, it is clear that from 1905 C\u00e9zanne was widely recognised throughout the art world - with the typical exception of Britain. CB Taylor Macclesfield A paean to Ian I first learned, to my surprise, that there were no natural rhymes for \"orange\" when I was nine (Letters, October 14). On the very day our teacher, Mr Griffin, told us this in our English class, I had written the following poem about my ginger friend in the maths class. I share my desk with Ian Gorringe. His face is pale and his hair is orange. Earl O'Keeffe Liverpool \u00b7 Send letters to Review, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. review@theguardian.com.
