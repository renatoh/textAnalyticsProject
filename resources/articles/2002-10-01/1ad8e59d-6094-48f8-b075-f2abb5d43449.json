If he wants to fill his players with hope he might tell them of his memorable experience as a ball boy in Skopje 32 years ago when the English came to town. Ilievski was a teenager in 1970 when Wolves visited what is now Macedonia's capital but was then part of Yugoslavia. Wolves, such a resonant name in Europe and with Derek Dougan in their squad, were beaten 5-2 by one of the local clubs, Vardar. Ilievski was more than happy yesterday to recall the triumph. \"I was 15 years old and I was collecting balls behind the goals but I remember that very well,\" he said with a rare smile. \"That is the proof that Macedonia as a country has a lot of football talent.\" The fact that Ilievski could accurately recall the year and scoreline showed the impact it had on him, though even ardent Wolves fans have probably long since forgotten the match. It was, after all, a post-season friendly and Wolves' squad was so stretched that the coach Sammy Chung played as a substitute. All of which perhaps shows how lacking Macedonia has been in great football moments. When Ilievski was asked to name the national team's most notable result since independence 11 years ago he plumped for a 1-1 draw with Denmark. What that says about his country's view of the Republic of Ireland is best kept from Mick McCarthy. Macedonia beat the Republic 3-2 in Skopje in 1997 and equalised 10 seconds from time against them two years later to force McCarthy's side into a play-off for Euro 2000 which they lost to Turkey. A T-shirt proclaiming \"I've had a Macedonia\" is still handed to Ireland's worst trainer at every session. It seems inconceivable that England will suffer similar embarrassment. Even Macedonia expect to be beaten, though they were boosted yesterday by the unexpected arrival in Southampton of their key man Georgi Hristov, the former Barnsley striker. Hristov had been expected to stay away because of a knee injury but received permission to travel from his Dutch club NEC Nijmegen. Having bemoaned Hristov's absence from his young team, Ilievski received a mobile phone message from him during his press conference. \"Hristov has just arrived in England,\" Ilievski announced. The striker, best known for unflattering remarks he is supposed to have made about Barnsley's women, will play only 45 minutes because of the state of his knee. Ilievski was soon comparing him with David Beckham, Ronaldo and Bobby Charlton, and few Barnsley fans would do that. \"Hristov is the leader of our team, like Beckham is for England or Ronaldo for Brazil,\" Ilievski said. \"It is a pity that he is not physically prepared but he is the leader. These leaders have to be born; you cannot make them. Bobby Charlton was not made by anyone; he was born a leader.\" Hristov will probably start up front in a 4-1-4-1 formation designed to contain and counter-attack. Sven-Goran Eriksson has described Macedonia as physically strong and identified Artim Sakiri, the left-sided midfielder, as particularly dangerous, including from set- pieces. Ilievski should know plenty about England, having gone to Japan to see their World Cup matches live. At the weekend his team pushed Turkey close before losing 2-1 in Skopje but he knows this will be tougher. \"Maybe at this moment to beat a team like England is impossible,\" he said. \"Macedonia has good players but you will see that they don't have much experience of matches like this one. \"If we keep developing this project for making a new young generation in our national team I will not be surprised if in the next qualification for the European Championship we reach the finals.\" Fourteen of Macedonia's squad are 24 or under and Hristov's second-half replacement is expected to be Goran Pandev, a 19-year-old signed by Internazionale but on loan to Spezia in Italy. Ilievski hopes more of his players will join top foreign clubs. \"If we want them to play well for the national team they have to go abroad to play in some of the biggest leagues because our first division is not on that level,\" he said. \"Of course matches like this always bring the chance for players to join some of the famous clubs.\" Ilievski has withdrawn his threat to resign after the match over a dispute with his federation and hopes his keeper Petar Milosevski is available after a head injury. The coach is without his right-back Igor Mitreski and might just cast his mind back to 1970 before kick-off, hoping for an even more unlikely Macedonian success story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
