But if you really are striving for the overpreened, overstroked, foie-gras-chowing lapdog look, it certainly helps to ram home the message. Kelly Osbourne has achieved the style immaculately. Her locks hang heavy and lumpen around her face like a pair of over-hairsprayed poochy ears. Not that dogs use hairspray. At least, not very often. Tori Spelling was once the queen of the lapdog look - her entirely immobile hair coupled ever-so-winningly with those puppy dawg eyes and a willing-to-please expression that stopped just short of a drool. Of course, the ultimate incarnation of this style remains the wet-nosed, daft-faced vogue struck by Barbara Cartland's many well-perfumed lapdogs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
