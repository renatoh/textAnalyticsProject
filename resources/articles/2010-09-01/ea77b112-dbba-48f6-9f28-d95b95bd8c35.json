Selby went out 3-2 on the final pink to Barry Hawkins, ranked 21, while Murphy was eliminated 3-0 by Dave Harold, ranked 31. Neil Robertson repeated his world final defeat of Graeme Dott, winning 3-1, after Dott had remarkably won the third frame after needing three snookers. Allister Carter, winner of the Shanghai Masters this month, won the fourth frame on the black to secure a 3-1 win over Thepchaiya Un-Nooh, the world amateur champion two years ago and the first player of world\u2011class potential to emerge from Thailand since James Wattana. Stephen Maguire prevailed 3-2 on the final black over Stuart Pettman after the world No35 had squandered two gilt-edged chances to clinch the decider."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
