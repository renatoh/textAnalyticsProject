The club\u2019s new manager had set Willian a return date of last Friday, after the winger\u2019s involvement at the World Cup with Brazil \u2013 they lost in the quarter-finals to Belgium on 6 July \u2013 but he did not show up. Willian\u2019s tardiness has been blamed on passport issues and it is understood he did report to Cobham for training on Wednesday. Yet Sarri made it perfectly clear that he was unimpressed at the situation. The winger is a transfer target for Real Madrid, with Manchester United also interested. Barcelona had previously tried to sign him before they moved for another Brazilian forward, Malcom. Willian, who will not feature in Sunday\u2019s Community Shield against Manchester City, has said he is happy at Chelsea and is not agitating for a transfer. \u201cI want to speak to Willian before I answer these questions,\u201d Sarri said. \u201cI am not happy about this situation but, before I answer, I would like to speak to him. Is it a strange situation? I think so.\u201d It was an eventful night in Dublin with the Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey feeling discomfort in his calf during the warm-up and being withdrawn from the starting line-up. Given his injury history, it is always a worry when he has a problem but Unai Emery, the Arsenal manager, said it was not serious. Sead Kolasinac, the left-back, was forced off in the second half with a twisted knee and he will be assessed on Thursday. Emery suggested that his injury could be an issue. Sarri substituted all 11 starters and his team lost their way and the lead in the closing stages with the Arsenal replacement Alexandre Lacazette scoring a stoppage-time equaliser to set up the shootout. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who had returned one week early from his post-World Cup break, missed the decisive kick in the first round of sudden death \u2013 Cech diving the right way to save \u2013 and that allowed Alex Iwobi to win it for Arsenal. The take-away from the game from a Chelsea point of view was an electric performance from the 17-year-old winger, Callum Hudson-Odoi, and an evening to forget for the striker, \u00c1lvaro Morata. Morata saw Petr Cech keep out his weak penalty in the 15th minute but, for him, it was merely the start of the nightmare. The manner in which his confidence evaporated was shocking and, although the usual pre-season caveats will be bandied about, his performance carried worrying echoes of some of those he put in over the second-half of last season. There was plenty of endeavour from Morata and he worked his way into dangerous positions but he could not finish. Three times after the penalty miss in the first-half he was teed up by Hudson-Odoi and three times, he fluffed his lines. Morata became a father to twin boys on Sunday and Sarri suggested that he might have been tired. \u201cI am not worried about Morata,\u201d he added. Hudson-Odoi could not finish when one-on-one with Cech at the end of the first-half but he consistently panicked H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn with his pace and directness. He won the penalty after he drew Bellerin into a rash tackle. \u201cHe will stay with us [in the first-team squad] for all the season,\u201d Sarri said. \u201cIn the future, he will be a very, very strong player.\u201d Antonio R\u00fcdiger headed Chelsea into a fifth-minute lead after an Arsenal breakdown on a corner and he ought to have scored again following a similar move in the second half. For Arsenal, the 18-year-old attacking midfielder, Emile Smith Rowe, impressed but it was Lacazette who made the biggest impact. He had gone close on two occasions and Iwobi once before he turned home from the substitute Reiss Nelson\u2019s cross."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
