Professor Sir Liam Donaldson, CMO for England, told the health select committee that ministers' decision to ignore his advice to impose a total ban on smoking in public places had put Britain \"amongst the laggards of public health policy making internationally instead of the world leaders\". His comments came as it emerged than 90% of respondents to a government consultation on the partial smoking ban opposed any exemptions for private members clubs and pubs that do not serve food, and wanted a blanket ban imposed. Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) said the consultation, carried out prior to the government announcing plans for a partial ban, should put pressure on ministers to move towards a comprehensive ban. \"We see it as clear evidence that the great majority of people are in favour of a total ban,\" he said. Professor Alex Markham, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: \"This document confirms that support for comprehensive smoke-free legislation was overwhelming. \"The government asked people for their views on an issue affecting their health, and then ignored their response. This is undemocratic and unacceptable. Sir Liam told MPs that ministers' backing for a partial ban had put him in a \"very difficult position\". But he decided to stay in his post in order to press the case for a complete ban. The CMO added that a partial ban was \"unworkable\" and \"in some respects\" would be worse than no ban at all, because it would increase health inequalities. Pubs in disadvantaged areas and the north of England, whose populations suffer the worst health in the country, were least likely to serve food and therefore most likely to allow customers to continue smoking, he said. The CMO added there was even greater need for a total smoking ban with the advent of extended opening hours for pubs and clubs, which would expose bar workers to other peoples' smoke for even longer periods. He said: \"I think the present proposal, which is a partial ban, is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. \"It leaves those most exposed to second-hand smoke unprotected. It loses out on the opportunity to reduce the prevalence of smoking and ill-health from second-hand smoke as a consequence. It actively, in my view, will increase health inequalities.\" MPs heard this was the first time in his seven years as CMO that ministers had gone against Sir Liam's advice. He said: \"It is rare for the government to ignore the advice of its chief medical officer or fail to act on it. In the seven years I have been in post, this is the first situation I have encountered in which it has happened.\" \"It put me in a difficult position and I have had to think hard about what I want to do about that position. There are some areas where if your advice is ignored and it damages the public health you would have to consider resignation. \"I thought very, very carefully about that and my feeling is I have championed this so far ... I have spoken publicly on my opposition to government policy on this one area.\" But Sir Liam said he believed that a blanket ban on smoking in all public places would eventually be imposed in England, and he wanted to play a part in bringing that change about. He said: \"My feeling is that this will eventually come and it is more likely to come if I stay in my post and continue to champion it.\" The partial smoking ban, under which private members clubs and non-food pubs are exempt, comes into force from summer 2007. It has been heavily criticised by healthcare professionals who warn that it will increase health inequalities as most pubs that do not serve food are in deprived areas. Some major hospitality and leisure companies also warn that premises in less affluent areas will chose to no longer serve food in order to retain their smoking customers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
