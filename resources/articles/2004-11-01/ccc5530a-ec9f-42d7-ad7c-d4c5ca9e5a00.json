Seeing as the US is allowed to pick its president from people who have no prior experience in national government, that should not be an issue. The fact is, the country mostly runs itself.\" The gambling bill How will recent events affect my vote? Sending British soldiers to be killed in Iraq is not going to make me vote Labour; introducing a new gambling law that will increase the number of problem gamblers in this country is not going to make me vote Labour. I really didn't know there was a shortage of casinos in this country until now, so a big thanks to New Labour for inviting in those helpful US corporations to plug the gap. The EU constitution Mr Blair has also signed the EU constitution. I have to be honest: I don't know what the EU constitution says or how it will affect UK sovereignty. I was going to research this and form a view but actually my not knowing is interesting in itself. I asked a few friends if they knew, and they didn't. There is an apparent divide between our politicians and the rest of us on Europe. By \"us\", I don't mean the organised antis but the non-antis (there aren't many pros around). While so many people are opinionated about the UK's relationship with the US, there is a bewildered or resigned neutrality over Europe. I guess this is a reflection of the fact that our politicians sell us our dealings with Europe in terms of the restraints they have managed to place on what they claims are the almost ungovernable desires of our partners in the EU - desires they tell us in the same breath are necessary evils we must entertain. It is difficult to see how the divisive and damaged Tony Blair can lead a sceptical and ill-informed country to a yes vote in a referendum on the constitution, whatever it contains. However, it might be entertaining to watch him try, especially as Peter Mandelson is chief cheerleader. Are these really the men to tell us what is best for the country? The Liberal Democrats The Lib Dems have no doubts about Europe. It's an interesting question as to whether they are ready to govern or not, and probably right to say that they could not do a worse job than Blair. I remain concerned, however, about throwing in my lot with a party that, while it has an attractive set of policies, doesn't have an ideological hook to hang them on. This is not just a problem with the Lib Dems: all three main parties' ambitions are merely managerial - tinkering at the edges while the multinationals rule the world. I'm not sure I am ready to embrace a politics that presents itself merely as a solution to a select shopping list of problems rather than an attempt to begin some process of change, with the restoration and then sustainable use of the environment as its guiding principle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
