Lynch moved to America last summer and has won nearly $2.5m (\u00a31.5m) this year. His ban currently applies only to Philadelphia Park, but a similar suspension may be invoked by other tracks. 'He has been ejected by Philadelphia Park for one year,' Justin Fleming, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Racing Commission, said. 'He is still licensed to ride in Pennsylvania as of now, and also in other jurisdictions. However, those tracks do reserve the right to not allow him to race.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
