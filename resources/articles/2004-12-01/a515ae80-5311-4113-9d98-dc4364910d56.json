The Grammy awards are notoriously padded out with who-cares gongs for best album notes and best surround-sound album, but all 10 of the 26-year-old rapper/producer's nominations are in major categories. He is up for best new artist; best rap album, for his 2.5m-selling solo debut The College Dropout; song of the year and best rap song for Jesus Walks; best rap solo performance for Through the Wire; best rap/sung collaboration for Slow Jamz; and best R&amp;B song for his contributions to Alicia Keys' single You Don't Know My Name. In addition, he is in competition with himself for the album of the year award: The College Dropout faces competition from The Diary of Alicia Keys, which West co-produced. The tally presumably comes as some consolation to West after last month's American Music awards, which he threatened to boycott in future after leaving empty-handed. \"I feel I was definitely robbed, I was the best new artist this year - I don't know if I'll be back at this award show next year,\" he complained on the night, displaying the superhuman reserves of good grace and humility traditionally associated with hip-hop artists. But an overheated ego is one of the few things West has in common with the rest of the rap fraternity. Despite the platinum album, the string of hit singles and now the Grammy nominations, West is hardly a famous face. His relative anonymity may have something to do with the image on the cover of The College Dropout. It is noticeably devoid of either diamond-dripping bling or the sort of outlandish couture of OutKast. Instead, it features West in a sports jacket and jeans, his face covered, for reasons best known to himself, by a fluffy bear's head. His album notes aren't characterised by standard-issue braggadocio about his achievements, but concentrates on West's failures at school. The songs follow suit, touching on such unlikely topics as the vulnerability of a recuperating invalid (Through the Wire), and a critique of rap materialism that is witty enough to avoid sounding like a lecture (All Falls Down). Dwelling on your academic shortcomings is hardly a regular theme in hip-hop, but then West's life story does not offer the standard ghetto rags-to-riches tale. His absent father was a Black Panther, but otherwise his upbringing in Chicago wasmiddle class. His mother was the head of English at Chicago State University, which may explain West's obsession with his failure to finish college. He first emerged in the late-1990s as a producer and protege of Damon Dash, the hip-hop entrepreneur best known in Britain for his stewardship of Jay-Z's career and his abortive attempt to turn Victoria Beckham into an R&amp;B star. His breakthrough came on Jay-Z's 2001 album The Blueprint: the tracks Takeover and Izzo (HOVA) introduced West's production style to a mainstream audience. His sound offers neither the ground-breaking futurism of Timbaland nor the overt commercialism of the Murder Inc or Bad Boy stables, but something between the two. He acknowledges that he stole his early trademark \"chipmunk soul\" trick of speeding up old samples to helium-pitch from the Wu Tang Clan's RZA, but his productions eschew the RZA's lo-fi grime in favour of recognisable samples: Takeover was based around the Doors' Five to One, Izzo (HOVA) around the Jackson Five's I Want You Back. West's career wasn't without its problems, however. He wanted to be a rapper, and claims that, despite his success as a producer, the music industry was uninterested. When he finally did start work on his debut album, it was interrupted by a near-fatal car crash in 2002, which left his mouth broken in three places. One of the Grammy-nominated tracks, Through the Wire, features West rapping with his jaw still wired up. Those early detractors may have had a point: West is a clever, original and funny lyricist, but he is not a fantastic rapper. What he has is an innate ability to blur the boundaries of hip-hop. The College Dropout exists somewhere between socially minded underground rap and chart-chasing commercialism, between envelope-pushing experimentation and pop hooks. West noted earlier this year that he makes records for \"regular people\". In rock music, that sort of statement is usually made by artists trying to justify the most bland music imaginable: it's the kind of thing Travis used to say, or Keane. But no one could call an album as vibrant as The College Dropout bland: in the polarised world of hip-hop, making records for regular people is something of an innovation, and one that pays dividends."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
