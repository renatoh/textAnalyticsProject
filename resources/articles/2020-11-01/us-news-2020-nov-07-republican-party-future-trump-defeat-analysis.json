They protected him from impeachment, tacitly approved as children at the border were prised from their parents and placed in cages, and looked the other way as peacefully protesting Americans were gassed for a photo opportunity. Now, in the death throes of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, as the president refuses to concede the election to Joe Biden, Republicans who once stood shoulder to shoulder with the man who reshaped their political party to his will are scrambling to distance themselves from his unfounded claims that the election is being stolen from him. \u201cOutrageous, uncalled for and a terrible mistake,\u201d the Maryland governor, Larry Hogan, said of Trump\u2019s erratic pursuit of his false allegations; \u201cvery disturbing,\u201d according to the Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey; and \u201creckless\u201d in the words of the former presidential candidate Mitt Romney. This breaking of ranks by growing numbers of senators, congressmen, governors and other elected officials \u2013 coming only after Trump\u2019s cause appeared lost \u2013 heralds a looming battle for the future direction of the Republican party with its figurehead gone from the stage. Those now openly critical after years of silence must weigh up the consequences of speaking out while there remain loyalists inside the party determined to carry the banner of Trumpism into the 2024 election and beyond. That faction includes Republican senators such as Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, a staunch Trump ally who has urged the president to \u201cfight on, exhaust all options\u201d in his futile effort to prove widespread election fraud. \u201cTrumpism will remain because he is such a wildly popular figure among their base. But, you know, it\u2019s always been pragmatic for many Republicans,\u201d said Jason Stanley, professor of philosophy at Yale University and author of the bestseller How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them. \u201cThere\u2019s some portion of the Republican party supporting him mainly because he\u2019s Trump, and he\u2019s owning the libs and saying racist things. And then another group is supporting him because he\u2019s pushing through the hardest-right policies. \u201cI expect the Republican party will prioritise whatever mechanism they need to dominate the courts, to keep suppressing the vote, to make sure that they can, as a minority party, remain in control of the levers of government.\u201d Stanley questioned the timing of those who appear to be breaking free from Trump by speaking out now. \u201cThe Republican party has been doing this anti-democratic thing since well before Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been acting like the Democrats are not legitimate, and they have no responsibility to co-govern with the Democrats and their sole purpose is to get the Democrats out and rule as a minority party. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve had four years of this. When people do what is minimally expected that doesn\u2019t mean you should be filled with praise for them \u2026 Norms have been so broken that we\u2019re asking whether we should praise people when the president is obviously trying to rig and steal the election.\u201d It remains to be seen if more moderate senior Republicans who have been critical of Trump, such as Mitt Romney, senator for Utah, will hold sway when the party plots its course for the Biden presidency. Romney released a sternly worded statement on Friday that said Trump\u2019s assertions the election was rigged, corrupt and stolen were wrong. \u201c[It] damages the cause of freedom here and around the world, weakens the institutions that lie at the foundation of the Republic, and recklessly inflames destructive and dangerous passions,\u201d he wrote. Other Republican figures are still on board the Trump train, even as it jumps the rails, including the fiercely loyal DeSantis, Cruz, Cotton, the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham and apologists such as Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, and Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer widely ridiculed for his appearance in the recent Borat movie. All have backed the president\u2019s false claims of malfeasance publicly, overlooking the fact they were made without evidence. \u201cThose are the most dangerous politicians we have. They have placed zero value on democracy,\u201d Stanley, the Yale professor, said. \u201cSome of them, like Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz, you know, might be more dangerous in various respects than Trump.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
