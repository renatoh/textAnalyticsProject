The Uzbek businessman has spent \u00a32.15m on Arsenal shares over the past week, taking his stake in the club to 27.37%. However, with the American's control of almost 64% of the shares confirmed last week, Usmanov's actions have been little more than a token gesture that cannot alter the ownership of the club. Usmanov will nonetheless hope that Kroenke will not be able to increase his stake beyond its current level. The Russian's purchase offer is also a message to the 8.66% of independent shareholders who remain that he would like them either to retain their interest or to sell to his Red &amp; White investment vehicle. Last month Usmanov said: \"I'm not going to sell. Arsenal can't do without me.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
