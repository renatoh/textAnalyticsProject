Sandro joined in a deal that could end up costing Rangers \u00a310m having seen his opportunities limited at White Hart Lane. Harry Redknapp had secured the midfielder for Spurs from Internacional four years ago and he had gone on to start 60 Premier League games for the north London club, though he has not featured since Mauricio Pochettino took up the reins at Tottenham earlier this summer. \u201cSandro\u2019s a proper footballer and a top-class professional, he\u2019s an absolutely fantastic signing for us,\u201d said Redknapp. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more pleased. He\u2019s been a massive target of mine all summer and I honestly didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to pull it off. It\u2019s a real statement from the club, from the owners, to bring in a player of his undoubted ability. He brings energy, aggression, power and quality. They call him the Beast. He\u2019s not only a top-quality footballer, but a fantastic boy as well. He\u2019ll lead by example for us. Tottenham fans loved him and I\u2019m sure the QPR fans will too.\u201d Kranjcar, who spent last season on loan at Loftus Road, has joined on another year\u2019s loan from Dynamo Kiev having taken a wage cut of 66%, according to Redknapp, to return to English football, where he has previously featured for Spurs and Portsmouth. Yet there was frustration for Rangers to endure on other mooted deals. An attempt to secure the former Arsenal, Chelsea and Portsmouth midfielder Lassana Diarra from Lokomotiv Moscow fell through due to a dispute between the 29-year-old and the Russian club. An attempt to get Arsenal\u2019s Francis Coquelin on a season-long loan also failed, while a potential \u00a310m move for Liverpool\u2019s Fabio Borini was scuppered by the Italian\u2019s personal terms despite lengthy talks with the player\u2019s representatives. It is understood the forward was seeking in the region of \u00a390,000 a week to move to London, an amount which was considered prohibitive at Loftus Road. Redknapp had explored the possibility of securing Norwich City\u2019s Gary Hooper, who was priced out of a move back to the Premier League, after Toronto resisted attempts to lure Jermain Defoe back to England from Major League Soccer. The Canadian club made it clear the striker would not be available until January at the earliest. \u201cWe did try for him and we came close,\u201d said the QPR owner, Tony Fernandes. \u201cWe agreed terms with the player, but his club in MLS didn\u2019t want to let him go. We\u2019ll probably come back to that in January because Jermain is happy to come here. But, for now, Harry is confident we have enough up front.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
