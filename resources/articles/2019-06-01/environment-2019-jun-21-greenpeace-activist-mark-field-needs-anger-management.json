However, she has no plans to press criminal charges over the physical assault. \u201cI think it is something best dealt with in the court of opinion,\u201d she said, while welcoming his suspension as a minister. Barker said she had been trying to deliver leaflets to guests on Thursday evening when she was grabbed by the neck and arm and forcibly ejected by Field, despite her pleas for him to release his grip and allow her to walk from the dining hall. \u201cI remember a chair being pushed out. Then being shoved. I was saying, over and over: \u2018This is a peaceful protest, a peaceful protest.\u2019 I was saying it quite audibly, certainly loud enough.\u201d She could not see the man\u2019s face, and had no idea who he was: \u201cI just knew it was a guy. And that he was very, very angry. You could hear that in the tone of his voice. \u201cI knew he wanted me out,\u201d said Barker, 40, who was carrying a phone and a small handbag. \u201c I thought if I just keep saying \u2018peaceful protest, peaceful protest\u2019 you hope to defuse the situation. But there was no defusing in his anger. \u201cHe continued to grip me by the neck and the arm all the way to the door of the building. Then, when we got to the door, he shoved me outside on to the street, and said: \u2018This is what happens when people like you disturb our dinner.\u2019\u201d Barker, from Builth Wells, Powys, has been a Greenpeace volunteer for many years and had entered the dinner with 20-30 activists who were hoping to deliver a speech about the climate crisis. Predominantly women, they wore red dresses with sashes stating: \u201cClimate emergency\u201d. \u201cWe wanted to enter in a very dignified way,\u201d Barker said. \u201cWe were respectful. We even ensured that our dresses were the correct length, because women who attend the Mansion House have to have a specific length.\u201d They entered as \u201ca block of red\u201d, said Barker, who works in environmental education and homelessness prevention, and runs a small holding and ethical angora business. \u201cThe doors were open as we were going in, and when security staff clocked what was happening they did start to close the doors.\u201d Each had their roles, and hers was to deliver copies of the climate emergency speech to guests in the form of sealed letters. Barker, whose Greenpeace activism has included joining a protest against dams on the Tapaj\u00f3s River in the Brazilian Amazon in support of the Munduruku people, said she believed she was one of the last to get in. She was to walk to the right of the room with several others, but they had been locked out. Other protesters, walking to the left of the room, were being detained by security staff, so she found herself alone. She thought if she walked around the back of the diners, she could hand a copy of the speech to Philip Hammond. \u201cNobody bothered me. It was fine.\u201d She estimates she was about 10 metres from Hammond, just approaching the right-hand corner of the top table. \u201cThen a gentleman in front pushed his seat out and just grabbed me.\u201d Asked if she was carrying or doing anything that could possibly have indicated she might be armed and threatening, she said: \u201cI had a phone, and a tiny handbag, which was open and full of leaflets. The only thing I was armed with was peer-reviewed science.\u201d She made no sudden movements, she said. \u201cI was walking past him just like a waitress or waiter would.\u201d Field refused to relinquish his grip, she said. \u201cI kept saying: \u201cLook, just let go. I will walk on my own. I am not about to start a wrestling match with you. I will walk.\u2019 He said: \u2018I\u2019m not letting go until you are out of this building.\u2019\u201d She said no one came to her defence. \u201cI think people were taken aback, like \u2018What?\u2019\u201d She said Field\u2019s anger shocked her; it was palpable in his voice and grip. \u201cThe pressure on my neck never eased all the way down the stairs and until we were outside.\u201d The inside of the top of her right arm was still red on Friday morning. Once at the door, he shoved her with such force, she said, she struggled not to fall over. A woman, also at the door, told her: \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome here.\u201d Once outside, Barker realised she was trembling. \u201cI think he needs to seriously look at why he reacted like that, why his anger went from 0-60 in 0.2 seconds. He needs anger management. Because I worry maybe he\u2019s on a bit of a simmer all the time, that just one or two things might tip him over, especially for him to be like that towards a woman. It makes me wonder what else might trigger him off, and who else might be at the receiving end,\u201d she said. \u201cI want him to think about what he did, and why he did it. And address his behaviour.\u201d Barker said she had anticipated verbal resistance. \u201cWe thought we might be ushered out, politely.\u201d Looking back on the incident, she said it was the authoritarianism that angered her. \u201cThat\u2019s what I felt. He was very domineering. He seemed to think he was in the right. \u201cThose in power are very privileged. They are very disconnected with the everyday struggles of everybody else. And I really felt that was apparent in his behaviour. They are in power. They believe they are right, and I was a silly little girl. \u201cI still find is unbelievable. We are in a climate emergency. Fossil fuels, the Greenland ice sheet is melting, the Himalayan ice caps are melting, there\u2019s going to be massive water shortages in the future and they are worried about their dinner being disturbed. \u201cI think we should remember that protest is a legitimate part of our democracy. It helps us evolve. Good things come from it. Look at the suffragettes, India democracy and Gandhi, the Black Power movement. \u201cAnd behaviour like this is trying to crush it, and we will keep rising up, because we have got to.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
