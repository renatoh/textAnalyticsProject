Houllier has privately resigned himself to the fact that his six-year stay on Merseyside is to end over the next few days, the decision to part company having been taken somewhat reluctantly by the chairman David Moores and his chief executive Rick Parry despite the potential salvaging of Champions League football for next season. Two of England's most highly regarded young managers, Alan Curbishley of Charlton Athletic and Middlesbrough's Steve McClaren, are believed to feature strongly on the board's shortlist. Yet, with the club maintaining their silence yesterday, Liverpool have left themselves in an uneasy state of limbo having failed even to deliver confirmation to Houllier that he is to leave. The Frenchman was at Melwood yesterday, attempting to make it appear like business as usual alongside his assistant Phil Thompson and the rest of his coaching staff as he busied himself with plans for a pre-season in which he will not be involved. Moores has since departed on a family holiday to Scotland, though Parry may be moved to meet Houllier and make an announcement before leaving on a holiday of his own next week. In the meantime transfer negotiations, aside from the completed \u00a314.1m signing of Djibril Ciss\u00e9 from Auxerre which will go through on July 1, have been temporarily suspended. Yet the board's recent deliberation over resolving Houllier's future has effectively priced them out of any realistic chance of luring their first choice, Jose Mourinho, to Anfield. Sources close to the Porto manager confirmed last night that he will be named as the successor to Claudio Ranieri at Chelsea next month after the Champions League final against Monaco. Mourinho had previously suggested that, if given the choice, he might prefer Anfield over Stamford Bridge and a tentative inquiry from Liverpool as to his availability is believed to have taken place. However, the ambitious Portuguese has since been enticed to Stamford Bridge by Roman Abramovich's generous contract offer - he is likely to earn around \u00a33.5m a year in west London - and intends to bring several members of his backroom staff with him on signing a four-year contract. Instead, and with the Valencia coach Rafael Ben\u00edtez having stated his desire to remain at the Mestalla - \"I fully intend to be here next season,\" he said, albeit in the glorious aftermath of Wednesday's Uefa Cup victory over Marseille - Liverpool are likely to look closer to home for a successor. There is support for Curbishley, not least among the playing staff, with the club's directors impressed by his achievements at The Valley and with the style in which his team have played since establishing themselves in the Premiership four years ago. The only reservations surround his limited experience in European competition, with Liverpool facing a qualifier to reach the Champions League group stages in August. Those same doubts would surface over an approach for McClaren, though the club's England contingent would welcome his arrival having been coached by him at international level. Furthermore it is thought neither McClaren not Curbishley would object to working with Kenny Dalglish in his anticipated new role as technical director at Anfield. Any formal approach to another manager will have to wait until Houllier has left the club. The Frenchman may have privately accepted the inevitable but will not resign and risk forfeiting a financial settlement that could amount to as much as \u00a31.5m to cover the final year of his contract."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
