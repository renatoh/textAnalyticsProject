In the eastern state of Thuringia, where the CDU was beaten into third place by the openly xenophobic Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) at state elections last month, 17 politicians from the party have written a letter calling for lifting the cordon sanitaire around the far-right outfit. The letter, which does not mention the AfD by name, demands a readiness for coalition talks with \u201call democratically elected parties\u201d \u2013 a breach of the CDU\u2019s official party line. The proposal has been met with vocal condemnation within the CDU\u2019s national leadership. In an op-ed for Der Spiegel published on Wednesday morning, party secretary Paul Ziemiak called the Thuringian leader of the AfD, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, \u201ca Nazi\u201d, arguing that a governing alliance would amount to \u201ca betrayal of our Christian Democratic values\u201d. If the CDU\u2019s Thuringian branch were to cooperate with the AfD, regional politician Werner Henning told Die Welt, it would \u201ctear apart\u201c the party. Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said the letter-writers would \u201chelp to make the AfD more socially acceptable.\u201d Already once in German history, Schuster warned, civil politicians had acted as \u201cstirrup holders\u201d for a party run by the far-right. The wrangle over principles and power in the eastern state is part of a wider free-for-all in the party that has governed Germany for 17 out of 24 postwar terms, facilitated by Merkel\u2019s relative absence from the hubbub of domestic politics and her designated successor\u2019s struggle to build a profile. CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer was once seen as Merkel\u2019s successor-in-waiting but has struggled to make her mark, even after taking over the defence ministry in July, not least because her mentor\u2019s support for her policy initiatives has remained lukewarm at best. Friedrich Merz, a conservative of the old guard and darling of the all-powerful Springer media empire, used the poor election results to launch an open attack on Merkel, saying the result was a \u201cvote of mistrust\u201d in her coalition government with the centre left. \u201cWe are in a really difficult situation\u201d, said Merz, who came second in the race for the party chair last December. \u201cIn my view that has mainly got to do with the chancellor\u2019s inaction and lack of leadership, which has descended on this country like a veil of fog.\u201d The row has seen some of the chancellor\u2019s old allies reach to stab her in the back, while some of her fiercest critics have changed tack to fall in line with her centrist interpretation of the CDU\u2019s role. Health minister Jens Spahn used to be a vocal opponent of Merkel\u2019s stance during the refugee crisis, describing her migration policies as recently as last autumn as \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d that was putting off formerly loyal voters. In an article for the Guardian, however, the openly gay politician appears to pitch his tent closer to Merkel\u2019s camp rather than that of her detractors. While continuing the warn of the dangers of \u201cuncontrolled immigration\u201d, the former hardliner now strains for a positive message. \u201cGermany is ageing rapidly,\u201d Spahn writes. \u201cOur message to the people of Mexico, the Philippines and all other nations is: if you share our values and want to work with us, please feel cordially invited!\u201d By contrast, some Merkel loyalists have broken out in open protest against a perceived leadership vacuum at the top. Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the chairman of the German Parliament\u2019s foreign relations committee and once seen as one of her allies, told the New York Times: \u201cGermany is now a complete void in everything. I can\u2019t see a European policy, the foreign minister is a void, the chancellor knows everything but does nothing.\u201d At the CDU\u2019s party conference in Leipzig on 22 November, the row threatens to escalate further, with no ceasefire in sight. \u201cThe possibility cannot be excluded\u201d, wrote S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, \u201cthat Merkel\u2019s parting from power could also result in the CDU\u2019s parting from the chancellory\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
