Take the Turkish rap epic Susamam, which translates as I Can\u2019t Stay Silent: a 14-verse manifesto for a generation fed up with complicity, and the largest collaboration in the history of Turkish rap. For a quarter of an hour, 19 artists challenge a litany of social issues, ranging from domestic violence to animal rights and police brutality. It got 20m hits on YouTube in the first week alone. What makes the track even more impressive is the climate in which it was born: Turkey\u2019s record on freedom of expression has taken an abysmal turn in recent years. Turkey is now the top jailer of journalists worldwide, and tens of thousands have been imprisoned in political witch-hunts that followed a failed military coup in 2016. With the nation now in active conflict in neighbouring Syria, it is common to see daily news reports of people jailed for something as simple as social media posts \u2013 even posting messages opposing war is considered support for terrorism. In such a stifled climate, Susamam prompted widespread acclaim and condemnation. Turkey is no less polarised than Brexit Britain or Trump\u2019s America; Susaman has been lauded as a protest anthem by some, and labelled a \u201cterrorist co-production\u201d by one pro-government tabloid. And its creative mastermind doesn\u2019t even have a record deal. Rapper \u015eani\u015fer, who spearheaded the collaboration, says: \u201cMy first reaction was genuine sadness, for the state of my country, of the world. I did this project to unite people, because these are everybody\u2019s problems. They\u2019re global issues we all face every day.\u201d The video begins with two relatively innocuous verses about human arrogance when it comes to destroying the environment, before going straight for the jugular. Set behind prison bars, \u015eani\u015fer fires back at a cellmate shocked at how citizens watch their every step, fearing the police: \u201cInnocent men rotting in jail without knowing why? It\u2019s all your fault! / This horrifying picture is your creation / Corrupt MPs, getting rich leeching on the backs of the poor / You sat by and called killers \u2018justified\u2019 because they are cops / You didn\u2019t say a word, which means you\u2019re guilty / Now the \u2018justice\u2019 you thought would protect you will come knocking at your door / When they falsely arrest you one night / No journalist will report it \u2013 they\u2019re all imprisoned.\u201d With cultural influencers under heightened scrutiny in the authoritarian \u201cnew Turkey\u201d, Susamam\u2019s artists had to choose their words wisely. Rappers have been jailed for lyrics that \u201cpromote criminality\u201d, so to dodge censors, the MCs shirk partisan politics and instead, like \u015eani\u015fer does, invite the listener to reflect inward: for each time you avoid eye contact with the homeless or, if you\u2019re a man, fail to question if your status at the top of the pyramid is a privilege you really want to have. \u201cIn that jail scene, I\u2019m criticising myself,\u201d \u015eani\u015fer says. \u201cI\u2019m a \u2018white Turk\u2019, we\u2019re the people who had the chance to think and act, and we didn\u2019t. That\u2019s Susamam\u2019s message.\u201d Its message is subversively crafted to transcend Turkey\u2019s political battlegrounds. \u201cIf someone who doesn\u2019t have the same political views as me listens to one part about the traffic problems, or animal rights, and agrees with it, he\u2019s also listening to something he wouldn\u2019t normally hear,\u201d \u015eani\u015fer says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the first way to change people, by making them listen to another person\u2019s side of the story.\u201d In a divisive time, perhaps it\u2019s the approach that\u2019s needed. As a major pop culture and commercial force, rap is relatively young in Turkey, and it is still music many parents would forbid their children to listen to. Grounded more in the tradition of spoken word and poetry of the Middle East and Asia than western hip-hop culture, Turkish rap has its own rhythmic grammar. The language\u2019s jumbling syllables demand a lyricist chop bars more like a syncopating freestyler, than depend on the beat to carry their verse. With few paths for artists to sign big-break record deals, the genre remains underground, making rap shows one of the few remaining free outlets of Turkish political consciousness. The typical attendees are young men coming after long work shifts, unable to understand the English lyrics of western rap, or relate to the high-flying materialist culture it comes from. Civil war, pogroms and jingoism are all in the Middle East\u2019s recent past \u2013 so empty materialism doesn\u2019t impress crowds. \u201cMusic is an art, but anything that makes money gets corrupted,\u201d \u015eani\u015fer says. \u201cI used to think that rappers were all against the system, against the inequality it creates, but I realised that many of them were just poor.\u201d Turkey has always struggled to have a single identity, despite nationalist politicians pushing the idea. A new generation, fed up with the patrimonial past, want to create something homegrown they can be proud of, and finding it in lyrics such as: \u201cHate is your weapon \u2026 Our weapon is our words!\u201d Full of juxtapositions and familiar references, Susamam goes on (and on), at times veering to the saccharine tone of a We Are the World reboot. One section reflects on traffic accidents, which kill 10,000 people in Turkey every year; a section on suicide pulls at heartstrings, while another on education sets alight the lie of meritocracy (the chief of Turkey\u2019s Central Bank was condemned for plagiarising his masters dissertation, but is still in office). Susamam, whose film has the option of English subtitles, also takes aim at issues that are as global as they are specific to Turkey. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our conscience as a species \u2013 we\u2019ve become programmed, obsessed with chasing growth and profit,\u201d \u015eani\u015fer says. \u201cThe root cause of these problems is wild capitalism, and this is a problem not just affecting Turkey.\u201d The chapter on women\u2019s rights stands out for its raw gravity. Taking a break from rap, it features the only female vocalist, Deniz Tekin (although Turkey does have female MCs) singing a sardonic ballad, pretending to be oblivious to the daily curse of being a woman in a violently patriarchal world, cut with real video and audio clips of violence against women. \u201cThis is a huge problem in Turkish culture,\u201d explains Fuat Ergin, the first artist on Susamam, and one of the originators of the Turkish rap scene back in the 80s. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a guy who can\u2019t deal with a divorce, so he kills his wife \u2013 they get a \u2018discount\u2019 on the prison sentence, and these guys get huge respect inside the jail, because he did something to redeem his honour. This is how people see things here.\u201d There\u2019s a Turkish idiom that goes: \u201cYou\u2019re a male, but not a man.\u201d The section\u2019s lyrics challenge that machismo mentality by flipping it to:\u201cYou\u2019re a man but not a human.\u201d Fuat says: \u201cThis is an arrow that we\u2019re shooting through the heart of their honour culture.\u201d The track continues: \u201cWhy are the males at the top of the pyramid, in the nation, at home, or in the metro?\u201d \u2013 a reference to Istanbul\u2019s Metrobus system, notoriously avoided by women for its unchecked sexual harassment. Susamam takes its most abstract philosophical turns just when it comes to the most controversial items on the political agenda. Rapper Ozbi, the only Kurdish artist in the project, ruminates on his existence; in a country where Wikipedia has been banned for years, he asks: \u201cIs understanding banned, too?\u201d Speaking Kurdish was banned for decades, and though Kurds have gained significant cultural rights, they still face discrimination as second-class citizens. Ozbi\u2019s questioning is necessary for political action, and though the video was produced before Donald Trump pulled the US out of the region, reigniting fighting between Turks and Kurds, its message is relevant as ever. Susamam traces a path forward that, disastrously, is not being offered by Turkey\u2019s political climate. \u201cThe point of this song is that it\u2019s possible to live together in peace and walk this way without killing each other, without the vendettas. It\u2019s possible,\u201d Fuat says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very painful process to forget all the blood. Many families lost their sons and daughters, on both sides. This is taking Turkey down, but we have to get over it. We don\u2019t want this war any more. This has to stop.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
