Two wasted shooting opportunities by Jack plus a strike that rattled the crossbar will add an edge to his already physical, short-fuse and marauding presence in the heart of the Hibs midfield. And a missed penalty in the 90th minute by Paatelainen, which would have added nicely to his hat-trick when these sides last met at Easter Road, will prove its own incentive. Yesterday, the pride and passion that suited Jack's temperament and Paatelainen's bustling play ended with an injury-time red-card for Thomas Flogel but a point for Hearts that maintains their hope of leapfrogging Kilmarnock next week for the final Uefa Cup spot. Normally, it is Russell Latapy who takes Hibs penalties, but he was notable by his absence after going awol from Friday's training and then - in the company of his Trinidad and Tobago compatriot, Manchester United's Dwight Yorke - allegedly going on a spree that ended with drink-driving charge. He will not play for Hibs again. Latapy apart, Hibs were unchanged from the side that lost 5-2 to Celtic last week. Bizarrely, Paatelainen, perhaps thinking of Hibs' 6-2 beating of Hearts in October, tried to chip the penalty that was awarded after Grant Murray appeared to bring David Zitelli down. Gary Wales smacked a shot that caught Nick Colgan cold but the ninth-minute effort stuck the post. In the space of a minute, Hibs were twice further tormented. Two defenders misjudged a Robbie Neilson long throw, requiring a desperate saving tackle by Gary Smith to deny St\u00e9phane Adam. Then Colgan saved point-blank to deny Wales as Hibs' rearguard was again sliced open. \u0095 On the day that their manager Martin O'Neill was named the Tennent's manager of the year, Celtic suffered a surprise 2-0 defeat at the hands of Dundee, Fabian Caballero scoring both goals. Dundee's other Argentine striker, Claudio Caniggia, is close to confirming his move to Rangers. But Celtic's main rivals will be losing the services of Lorenzo Amoruso, who will leave the club at the end of the season. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
