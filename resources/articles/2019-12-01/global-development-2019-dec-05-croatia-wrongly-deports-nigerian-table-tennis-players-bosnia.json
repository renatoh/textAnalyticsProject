Abia Uchenna Alexandro and Eboh Kenneth Chinedu, students at the Federal University of Technology Owerri in Nigeria, arrived in Zagreb on 12 November, on their way to participate in the fifth World InterUniversities Championships, held this year in Pula, Croatia. The 18-year-old table tennis players left Pula for Zagreb after the tournament, and were supposed to fly back to Lagos on 18 November. However, the night before their departure, while taking a walk in the Croatian capital they were stopped by two police officers who asked them for identification documents. \u201cWe tried to explain who we were and that our documents were in the hostel, but they took us to a police station,\u201d Chinedu told the Bosnian website \u017durnal. \u201cThey paid no attention to what we were saying.\u201d The officers mistook them for undocumented immigrants, put them in a van and transferred them to the border with Bosnia-Herzegovina where, that day, Croatian authorities had gathered together a group of migrants intercepted as they were attempting to cross the country. Police ordered the group to move through the woods and into Bosnia-Herzegovina. \u201cI refused to go into the woods,\u201d said Chinedu. \u201cThe officer told me he would shoot me if I didn\u2019t move.\u201d Uchenna and Chinedu were eventually deported to Bosnia-Herzegovina and ended up in a camp in Velika Kladu\u0161a, where thousands of migrants are stuck in tents without water or heating with temperatures as low as -2C. The two Nigerian students could not make themselves understood and it took until the end of November before volunteers at the camp contacted representatives of the table-tennis competition to tell them Uchenna and Chinedu were trapped there. \u201cThey told me two students from Nigeria were taken to Bosnia by Croatian police,\u201d the organiser Alberto Tanghetti told the Guardian. \u201cI asked them to send me photos and their names. After careful verification, we confirmed that those boys had participated in the tournament and had regular visas, issued by the Croatian authorities. I really don\u2019t understand what happened, because even the police in Pula were notified that they were here.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is even more absurd that no one believed the boys when they tried to explain to the police officers that they had regular visas. It would have sufficed to accompany them to the hostel to verify that they had entered Croatia legally.\u201d A spokesperson for the Croatian interior ministry said that the police had investigated the Nigerians\u2019 claims \u201cPolice officers have already witnessed cases of individuals who make an attempt to or even abuse their participation in sports competitions in Croatia to remain in the country,\u201d the spokesperson said. The ministry of the interior has confirmed that the Nigerians had regular visas and entered Croatia legally, but suggested that the students were making an attempt to remain and that the pair had checked out from the hostel before being stopped by the police. But the police\u2019s version of the facts does not explain why the officers deported the Nigerians to Bosnia, knowing that the students had entered the country with a flight to Zagreb and not from Bosnia. \u201cThose people are victims of illegal acts of the Croatian side,\u201d Dragan Mekti\u0107, Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s minister of security, told Al Jazeera. \u201cRespecting legal procedures, we now have to take them back to Croatia \u2026 It is obvious that they have Croatian visas, that they are in Bosnia and Herzegovina illegally. From their statements, it is obvious that Croatian police forcibly displaced them and we have to bring them back there.\u201d For years, aid workers and agencies have accused the Croatian authorities of illegally sending migrants trying to cross the border back to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Migrants are systematically beaten by Croatian police, who strip asylum seekers of their personal items and destroy their mobile phones to avoid being filmed. Last year, the Guardian documented compelling evidence of the physical abuse perpetrated by Croatian police, of which migrants in the Bosnian cities of Biha\u0107 and Velika Kladu\u0161a have been complaining. Croatia has denied any wrongdoing in that case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
