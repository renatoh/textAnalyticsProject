With Emmanuel Adebayor not allowed to play due to the terms of his loan deal from City, Defoe will step in to partner Rafael van der Vaart at the Etihad Stadium. The 29-year-old last started a league game on 3 January as his opportunities have been limited due to Redknapp's preference for Adebayor. City lead Spurs by five points and, asked if this was Defoe's big chance, Redknapp said: \"Its another chance for him \u2013 he's got nothing to prove to me, really. He's played for me wherever I've been [also at West Ham United and Portsmouth], so I've got great faith in him and I know what he can do so I'm sure he can do the job for us.\" Redknapp is confident that Defoe and Van der Vaart can link well despite the team lacking Adebayor's height on Sunday. \"I went to Aston Villa last season and played Defoe and Rafa together when we won 2-1, although Defoe got sent off. I quite fancy Defoe's movement with Rafa. We have to play football, we've got little ones \u2013 that is a key area, we have a small team. We look a small team and don't have a lot of size. We have to play and can't be hitting long balls up to Defoe and expect him to challenge their central defenders. We have to pass. \"Jermain has been bursting for a chance to get back in and play so he has got the opportunity to play.\" Redknapp has no problem with Adebayor being unavailable. He said: \"I think it is fair. You loan them out but it is difficult to play against your own club.\" Redknapp said he admires Roberto Mancini, the City manager, but does not like how the Italian has twice waved an imaginary red card on the touchline to try and influence referees. \"I don't think there is any need for it. He has done a great job there and when I have met him I have found him a really good guy. We all do things we shouldn't do at different times, make mistakes, we shout and scream. We get caught up in the game but it's not something I like to see.\" The Tottenham manager then joked that he would get his assistant, Joe Jordan, to have a word if Mancini does it again on Sunday: \"I will set Joe on him \u2013 Joe speaks Italian. He can talk to him. I don't like it, no. I wouldn't do it. I don't like to see it.\" While Redknapp said there was \"no chance\" of Niko Kranjcar being sold in the current transfer window he said of his interest in Blackburn Rovers' Chris Samba: \"I wouldn't want to sit here and say it's impossible and then we sign him. I'd look a fool in front of all you lads but at the moment it's not a possibility. I do like him. I wouldn't say I wouldn't have him. I like Samba. He is a real centre-half but not at the moment.\" Redknapp added he was content with the depth of his current squad and Spurs are yet to make an official bid for any player this month. \"I have one or two players out on loan I could bring back to strengthen the squad if I needed to. The boy [Steve] Caulker has done well at Swansea and [Kyle] Naughton at Norwich,\" he said. \"But to bring them back, they are better off playing football at the moment in the Premier League than not playing here or sitting around. I'm happy with the squad. If we bring in one player in the window [then fine], but at the moment we are not even close to bringing one in or have we made an offer for anybody. I haven't even got anybody in mind.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
