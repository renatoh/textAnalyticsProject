Having co-created Umbrella for Rihanna and Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It) for Beyonc\u00e9, Nash need never work again. But Love King is his third solo album, a collection of mid-paced songs that take the icky sex ballad template perfected by R Kelly and wraps it in sparse, forward-thinking productions. Nash's skill is keeping things minimal; most of the songs here ride crisp, finger-snapping beats augmented by huge synth rushes, while moments of experimentation flutter around the periphery. Its centrepiece is the fantastic Yamaha, a kind of modern day reimagining of Prince's Let's Go Crazy, complete with a central drum pattern that bounces around the song like a ping-pong ball. Boastful, ridiculously egocentric and often lyrically hilarious \u2013 \"My love gets it popping like the Taliban\" boasts Sex Intelligent \u2013 Love King doesn't win points for subtlety but, as an example of a producer at the top of his game, it's second to none."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
