Even though the parents of the young woman depicted in the painting, Rachel Whitear, who died in May 2000 apparently from a drugs overdose, appealed to the gallery to withdraw the image, saying that it was \"distasteful and completely inappropriate\", and that they felt \"churned up and devastated\", there was never any possibility that the painting would be taken down. Stella Vine justified the painting of Rachel Whitear in the usual terms. \"I will paint her,\" she said in an interview last week, emphasising that she is still making sketches of the dead woman, \"because it is important to me and I feel valid in what I am doing.\" This is what art is in our culture - something that feels valid to the artist. And when that is also validated externally, as Vine's work is, by attention and money, then there is no question but that it has become successful art. Rachel Whitear herself, of course, cannot validate Stella Vine's enterprise. Even before Vine came on to the scene, Whitear's picture had been employed in a way that she could never have foreseen. When her parents decided to use images of her life and death - including a photograph of her corpse still clutching a syringe - as part of a campaign against the evils of drugs, many people felt uneasy. Even though her parents had invited us to intrude into their grief, that didn't stop the campaign from looking almost voyeuristic. That use of her image as a campaigning symbol has come to look even less straightforward since it was revealed that the cause of Whitear's death had never, in fact, been established. Her body was exhumed yesterday in order to try to pin down whether one of the most famous drug casualties in our culture had even been killed by drugs. Rachel Whitear couldn't consent to her parents' use of her image, and she can't consent to Stella Vine's use of it. Vine's work depicts her in a naive, sploshily immediate style, scarlet dripping from her smiling mouth as if she were a vampire who had just feasted. Vine has said that she used Whitear's image because she connected to the pain of Whitear's story. She seems to see her as an icon of feminine misery - rather like Princess Diana, whose image is used by Vine in another attention-grabbing work. Who knows what Rachel Whitear herself, who was trying to rebuild her life and said she was giving up heroin shortly before she died, would have made of being seen as nothing but a victim? Playing with the images of public figures, with or without their consent, has a long pedigree in art. From Warhol on, when artists have reworked the images of celebrities it has usually looked like a useful comment on the way that our culture is so in thrall to those images. And while celebrities - even dead celebrities, especially in the United States, where a right of publicity can be held by the estates of deceased stars - often battle against artists for control of their images, the public tends, rightly, to side with the artist rather than the famous face. But that all feels very different when the face is one of a dead girl who never chose to be a public figure. Rather like the portrait of Myra Hindley executed by Marcus Harvey and made with children's handprints, also exhibited by Charles Saatchi, this work reveals itself as less than the original controversy suggests. It is not just the childish style of Vine's work that is limited. Perhaps we want art to do more than be sensationalist and perhaps we want artists to do more than seek their own validation. I don't mean to suggest that all art should be a community project, but the figurative art that seems most vivid now is often the art that suggests a real connection between the artist and the subject. Marc Quinn's sculpture of the pregnant Alison Lapper, which is to occupy the empty plinth in Trafalgar Square, has come in for criticism for being blandly politically correct. But for many viewers, myself included, there is something deeply intriguing about its quiet humanity, which is only increased by the obvious pride that Lapper herself takes in this celebration of her body and the fact that she is as articulate as Quinn in her defence of the statue. The connections between an artist and a subject can inform a work in mysterious ways. When Antony Gormley went to Gateshead to make his group of stylised statues, Domain Field, there was a real excitement among the people who turned up to be cast in the group, a sense of togetherness and participation in the artist's work. And that excitement somehow drove through the work to make part of its undeniable effect, an effect of energy suggested both by the spiky execution and by the physical relationships of the subjects to one another. Could it be that the art that resonates most right now is the art that trades on its humanity rather than its mere sensationalism? n.walter@btinternet.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
