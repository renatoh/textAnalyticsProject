The Texan finished fourth in yesterday's stage of the Dauphine Libere on the Giant of Provence but is now in second place overall, 21 seconds behind his compatriot Levi Leipheimer going into this weekend's mountain stages. Yesterday's climb to the rocky, windswept finish near the memorial to Simpson, coupled with his third place in Wednesday's long time trial stage, indicates that Armstrong is not far from the form which has taken him to six consecutive Tour wins, even if yesterday he was not satisfied. \"I would not say it was great, I would not even say it was good. I suffered a lot and I'm a little bit disappointed. Maybe I was still a little bit heavy for a climb like that by a few pounds,\" he said. Armstrong is well aware that it is hard to hit peak form in the Dauphine and maintain it through the Tour. Last year's winner, Iban Mayo, looked unstoppable in June but flopped in July. \"You often see riders do well in the Dauphin\u00e9 and a month later they are not so strong. I have learned not to be impatient. I'm trying to gain some condition here, some race rhythm and to focus on the big objective.\" Since July 2000 Armstrong has regretted his decision to gift a Tour de France stage victory on the Ventoux to the Italian Marco Pantani. In 2002 he was unable to catch the Frenchman Richard Virenque on the way to the summit. \"I think I missed my chance [when Virenque won] and [the mountain] never forgave me. It held a grudge,\" Armstrong said. Asked if he would return to the climb after his career is over, he replied: \"Yeah, to drink wine and eat tapenade.\" In the immediate future he has to contend with tomorrow's mountain stage, with four passes of between 3,500 and 5,000ft above sea level."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
