Samir Bhamra, who runs a dance group in Leicester, said the young people were taking part in a TV show called Superchef Junior when attackers struck the shopping centre. An aunt remained in hospital in a critical condition, he added. Writing on Twitter, Bhamra, who was born in Nairobi, added: \"May those who fall into shadow rest in peace and those responsible burn in hell.\" Further details have emerged of victims caught up in the attack which has left at least 62 dead and more than 170 injured. Among the six British victims was an eight-year old girl, Jennah Bawa, her mother Zahira, and award-winning architect Ross Langdon, who had dual British and Australian citizenship. Also among the victims was Moon Hee Kang, a 38-year-old South Korean Cambridge graduate who died from gunshot and grenade shrapnel wounds on Sunday. Her husband, a British citizen, had surgery for a gunshot wound and is in a stable condition, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. Friends paid tribute to Hee Kang, who had recently moved to Nairobi and worked for Samsung. On her Facebook page friend Fotis Vergis wrote: \"She was excited to be able to settle down, after moving around these past years, built a home and put her good heart and herself to good use to help and raise others to the light.\" Another friend Susan Anderson said Moon had loved gadgets and technology. \"She was very bright and enjoyed her work, she could have gone anywhere but she decided to go to Africa partly because she wanted to contribute to the economy there.\" Writing on Moon's Facebook page, friend Mandkhai Lkhagvasuren wrote: \"You embraced those who are around you with open heart and open arms and I am so lucky to have been one of many to be close to your beautiful smile and kindness.\" The mother of Ravi Ramrattan, an economist who studied at Cambridge, Oxford and the London School of Economics before moving to Kenya, said her son was \"friendly and humble\" and liked by everyone. \"Ravi left me too early. He should not have died now because he had so much to live for. He was an innocent victim in that situation,\" Parbatie Ramrattan told the Trinidad and Tobago Guardian . His friend Josh Weinstein, paid tribute to a man he called \"exceptionally smart\". He wrote: \"[H]is life was cut short by evil men [...] they took from the world a great person who wanted to make the world a better, more inclusive and equitable place for the most downtrodden and hard-on-their-luck people. He could have done anything, but he chose this life.\" Former US president Bill Clinton paid tribute to malaria expert Elif Yavuz, who was a fortnight from giving birth when she was killed alongside her husband Tasmanian-born Ross Langdon. \"Elif was brilliant, dedicated, and deeply admired by her colleagues, who will miss her terribly,\" he said in a statement. \"Elif devoted her life to helping others, particularly people in developing countries suffering from malaria and HIV/AIDS. On behalf of the entire Clinton Foundation, we send our heartfelt condolences and prayers to Elif's family and her many friends throughout the world.\" A French mother and daughter were among the first victims of the attack after being shot in the car park as the assault began. Corinne Dechauffour, 54, and her daughter Anne Dechauffour, 27, were originally from Nice on the C\u00f4te d'Azur. Corinne Dechauffour, lived most of the year in Kenya where her husband ran a hotel complex on a wild-life reserve, while her daughter had signed a modelling contract in London. Among the 10 victims of Indian origin identified were Paramshu Jain, the eight-year-old son of a bank manager, and Sridhar Natarajan, a 40-year-old from Tamil Nadu who was working for a pharmaceutical firm. Bangalore resident Sudarshan B Nagaraj, who had only arrived in Nairobi the day before the attack, was also killed. Kenyan victims included 24-year-old food entrepreneur Rajan Solanki, lawyer and aviation expert Peter Simani, and sales and marketing director Mitul Shah, who friend Half Jadhe Half Kyuk said died \"trying to save stranded children\" according to a message on KenyaList.com. Neha Mashru, a student at the private Oshawal Academy near Westgate shopping centre, was a \"head girl, dancer, awesome friend,\" said a Facebook page set up in her memory. Sisters-in-law Joyti Kharmes Vaya, a 37-year-old mother of three, and Maltiben Ramesh Vaya, a 41-year-old mother of two, were killed, as were Anuj Shah, who ran the Sona Shoppe photography studio, and Nehal Vekaria, a 16-year-old student."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
