Though it may have the same clean lines it had when you first bought it - barring a scratch or two - and continue to give you unstinting service, it may not be the vehicle you thought it was. It could be a double. Just imagine the indignity of getting a parking ticket from Burnley when you live in a village on the south coast and have never ventured further north than Guildford. Or of being woken one morning by two policemen who tell you your car is being taken away for forensic tests. It could happen at a home near you. It could even happen to you. It's due to a shady practice known as car-ringing or cloning. Of the third of a million cars stolen each year in the UK, 120,000 are never recovered - and many of these are ringers. Forget those gripping stories of cars being loaded on to trailers at dead of night. Car-ringing is something altogether more sinister. For after a batch of stolen vehicles has been snatched up and taken away, organised gangs of ringers swap their identities. The purpose? To avoid detection. Until recently, most ringers were doubled with scrapped or abandoned vehicles. Canny gangs noted down the chassis and registration plate numbers and switched them on to stolen cars. But new laws are about to close this loophole. This month all repaired or scrapped vehicles will now be vetted at the DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency) test centres and so prevent just any old vehicle being used to shroud a car's identity. The DVLA has introduced new rules which mean that anyone who needs a tax disc must produce their V5 registration form, or log book, with their documents at the local post office. If they don't have one, their car will not be licensed. 'This is good news,' says Detective Chief Inspector Dave Ryan, head of the Metropolitan Police anti-ringer unit. 'Using scrapped or discarded vehicles has been too easy for the ringers.' However the gangs are turning to more sophisticated methods to switch cars - namely the internet. After spotting a car on an overseas showroom's website, ringers get hold of its details from the site manager and use them to apply for documents on a similar car in the UK. This means that Aston Martin DB7 you have been so proudly driving for the past two years may be another DB7 altogether. Even if you buy a ringer in good faith, rigorously checking its documents and features, you may not spot the tell-tale signs. By law, the police can take it away and return it to its original owner or insurer. And you have no comeback. Even suing the dealer can be tricky. For now, it will take time for the new laws to really bite - as the London congestion charge has shown. For since it was introduced, police forces, local councils and motoring organisations have been deluged with calls from angry drivers who have received fines for illegally parking in London. The trouble is, most of them have not been anywhere near the capital for months. Almost all the tickets were for ringers, not for drivers changing their number-plates in a desperate effort to beat the \u00a35 fee. Being the canny thieves that they are, ringers like to get value for money. So they mostly target upmarket vehicles such as later BMWs, Mercedes, Audi TTs, Volkswagen Golfs, Mitsubishi Shoguns and Toyota Land Cruisers, though the AA recently came across a four-door Vauxhall Astra that had been 'cut and shut' (the front and back of two different cars welded together) into a five-door hatchback with false number plates. Ryan says most ringing happens in the relatively wealthy area of the Home Counties, with many local DVLA offices handling 3,000 clones a month. Police are also trying to track down a gang that exported \u00a31.5m worth of switched cars from the UK to the Far East. The answer, says Ryan, is for all European countries to have the same registration system. So next time you see a smart-looking limo on a garage forecourt, make sure its chassis number tallies with its V5. It may save you far more than an \u00a380 parking fine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
