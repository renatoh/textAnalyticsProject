Cameroon's 3-0 semi-final stroll against the previously impressive hosts Mali marks them down as favourites to retain a trophy they won for the third time on penalties two years ago. And Patrick Mboma, who missed the semi with a foot injury, is confident of being fit. \"I will be OK for the match, it's just not a serious injury,\" said the Parma striker who has scored three goals in his four games here. However the coach Winfried Schafer will wait until the last minute before naming his team as Pius Ndiefi played well against Mali. \"It's a great situation to be in,\" said the German, who also has Real Mallorca's striker Samuel Eto'o to call upon. \"Although it will be difficult to leave one of them out, it is a delight for me to be able to make that kind of choice.\" Cameroon are physical and tactically astute, and their 3-5-2 should ensure a fascinating contrast of styles with Senegal's classic 4-4-2. \"I respect the Cameroonians, sure, but I don't fear them,\" said the Senegal striker El Hadj Diouf.\"We have a great team, but above all we are so close we are like a band of brothers.\" Morale is high for Cameroon, too, despite their goalkeeping coach Thomas Nkono reportedly receiving a one-year touchline ban for his incursion on the pitch prior to Mali's semi-final, which saw him bundled away in handcuffs after being accused of dropping \"magic\" on to the pitch. That said, Mali's president Alpha Oumar Konare went to the changing room after the match to apologise. \"It was a gesture that we really appreciated. Mali owed us an apology and we received it from their leading citizen,\" Schafer added. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
