Cole was discussing personal terms with Chelsea after West Ham agreed to sell the 21-year-old England midfielder for \u00a36.6million. And while Manchester United refused to comment, it is believed Veron will follow him into Stamford Bridge as Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri takes his spending under new club owner Roman Abramovich to an astonishing \u00a358.6million. Veron, who is expected to move for \u00a315million despite costing United \u00a328.1million in the summer of 2001, was the subject of intense speculation linking him with a move to Chelsea throughout United's American tour. Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson initially insisted Veron was staying at Old Trafford, but towards the end of the tour he admitted the Argentinian's future was unclear and said today: \"We should know the real story soon.\" After arriving in Portugal ahead of tomorrow night's friendly against Sporting Lisbon, Ferguson said: \"So many things have happened while we've been away on tour, and things have been quite muddied.\" Veron and Cole will join fellow newcomers Glen Johnson, Wayne Bridge, Geremi and Damien Duff at Stamford Bridge. West Ham conceded that the sale of Cole was needed to secure their own financial future following relegation, and they will now attempt to hold onto Jermain Defoe, Michael Carrick and David James. A Chelsea statement confirmed: \"The club have agreed a fee of \u00a36.6million with West Ham United for England midfielder Joe Cole. \"The two parties are currently in talks. He has yet to agree personal terms and pass a medical.\" The player's agent David Geiss told BBC Radio 5 Live the deal should be tied up tomorrow in order to meet the deadline for Cole to play in Chelsea's Champions League qualifier against Slovakia's Zilina or Israeli outfit Maccabi Tel Aviv. \"The situation at the moment is that West Ham have accepted a bid from Chelsea and we are in talks with them. \"Joe will have a medical and we will finalise his personal terms. We have spoken to Chelsea, we are in discussion now. We are look possibly to have this thing wrapped up tomorrow so he would be eligible to play in the Champions League qualifying games.\" Abramovich's arrival in the Barclaycard Premiership has signalled the most amazing spending spree ever witnessed in British football. But the Russian oil magnate has still warned fans not to expect any instant success. \"There are plans for more players but I cannot comment on which. We will manage to sign lots of players. Seven will be good.\" Former defender Paul Elliott welcomed Cole's potential arrival, although he is unsure exactly where the midfielder might fit into Ranieri's plans. \"He's a young man, wonderfully gifted technically and it would be interesting to see how he would tactically fit into Chelsea's pattern of play,\" he told Chelsea TV. Such is Abramovich's spending power and ambitions, he even admitted his interest in signing David Beckham \"if he considers the possibility of going back to England and doesn't make it in Spain as I like him as a player\". Then again, he still struck a note of realism as he reportedly confirmed Ranieri would be in charge for at least the whole of this season. Speaking in his home province of Chukotka, he told the Evening Standard: \"Even the best players don't immediately make a team. Time is needed to make a team, then you hope for a result.\" Abramovich, who plans to organise friendlies between Chelsea and Russian teams, also revealed the way in which he had resolved to buy the Stamford Bridge club. \"I looked through 10 football teams in England,\" he said. \"Realistically, four were available to buy. If we compare the quality and the position, Chelsea was the best option.\" Asked about his long-term commitment, he added: \"It's very difficult to speak about the period of 10 years. Maybe 25 years, maybe 50 years. It could be 25 or 50.\" A statement from West Ham confirmed they had agreed a fee with Chelsea after Cole made it clear he was unlikely to extend his contract at Upton Park when it expires at the end of next season. The statement read: \"Following 18 months of very amicable discussions between Joe, the club, his father and his agents, it was made clear that Joe would not consider extending his contract past its expiry at the end of the coming season, believing that his international career would be enhanced by regular European club competition experience. \"Had Joe left the club at the end of the season, West Ham United would have been entitled to compensation because he was still under 23. \"However this figure would have been below \u00a3500,000 had he gone to a foreign club, possibly higher to an English club but, with no guarantee of the figure which might be obtained, the board felt that the decision to accept a significant offer now was the correct one. \"This transfer now ensures that no further sales will be necessary following the financial implications of relegation and that all future offers will be decided by the manager on a team selection basis rather than by the board on a financial one. \"The priority now will be bringing players in to strengthen the squad ahead of the forthcoming season.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
