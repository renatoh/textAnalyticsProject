Bacardi is planning to use people's pets as mobile advertising hoardings following the success of its \"Tomcat\" TV ad for Bacardi Breezer. The drinks company has produced 1,000 branded collars identical to those worn by 'Tom', the cat in the commercial who is seen sneaking away from its owner to go nightclubbing. Bacardi plans to distribute the collars, featuring its distinctive 'bat wing' logo, through vet's surgeries and reader offers in pet magazines. \"It's a way of extending the ad and the Bacardi brand into people's homes,\" said a spokeswoman. The campaign is the latest in a trend of PR stunts linked to advertising icons. Last month Reebok produced 2,500 miniature 'beer belly' toys to exploit the popularity of its recent running shoes TV commercial. The spokeswoman said the company recognised the opportunity after receiving more than 300 calls from excited TV viewers requesting the collars for their own cats. The TV ad for the pre-mixed alcholic drinks was produced by McCann Erickson earlier this year. The agency used four silver tabbies who also starred in the Hollywood film Stuart Little. The cats were flown over from Los Angeles and given their own hotel room, according to the spokeswoman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
