Evaristo won in October for her polyphonic novel Girl, Woman, Other, which is told mostly from the perspectives of 12 black women. The honour was shared with Atwood, who won for The Testaments, in a controversial decision that some said diminished Evaristo\u2019s achievement in being the first black woman to take the award. Speaking on the BBC News Channel on Tuesday night, in a segment about the Turner prize nominees\u2019 decision to share that award, presenter Shaun Ley compared the Turner news to the Booker judges\u2019 split decision. \u201cNow, this is a bit different from the Booker prize earlier in the year where the judges couldn\u2019t make up their minds, so they gave it to Margaret Atwood and another author, who shared the prize between them,\u201d he said. In response, Evaristo wrote on Twitter: \u201cHow quickly &amp; casually they have removed my name from history \u2013 the first black woman to win it. This is what we\u2019ve always been up against, folks.\u201d The clip had been shared by the Twitter account for the multicultural travelling book carnival, Book Love. Evaristo\u2019s comment quickly went viral, with her fellow authors offering their support. \u201cThat\u2019s appalling, Bernardine. In all the countries I\u2019ve visited recently (France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium) everyone is talking about your book,\u201d said novelist Jonathan Coe. Novelist Linda Grant tweeted: \u201cI thought dividing the Booker prize this year was a serious mistake. The BBC naming the winner as Margaret Atwood and \u2018another author\u2019 is testament to how damaging it has been. All power to Bernadine Evaristo who should have won outright.\u201d Author Winnie M Li, winner of the Guardian\u2019s Not the Booker prize, said she was fuming and called for an apology for a writer \u201cwho has been a champion for \u2018Othered\u2019 writers for decades &amp; a serious acknowledgment of how much this mistake of yours says about media erasures &amp; public recognition\u201d. A spokesperson for BBC News said: \u201cOur presenter was speaking live when he made the comparison between the Turner and Booker prize results \u2013 this part of the item was unscripted and he didn\u2019t say Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s name at the time. We apologise to her for the offence caused.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
