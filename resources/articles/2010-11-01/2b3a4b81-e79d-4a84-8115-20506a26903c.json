If so, the hopeful message of southern fallibility did not reach the farthest outpost up here. The south were in a different class and merciless. Seven tries to none was the final tally. And the night took a yet more sickening turn for the Scots when Max Evans, whose brother Thom confirmed his retirement from rugby last week after his neck injury in the Six Nations, suffered a serious-looking injury. The game was ended just over a minute early so that he could be properly tended to. Mercifully, he was walking around in the changing room afterwards, his injury no more than a stinger. So, a record defeat, and the All Blacks did not even need the full 80 to do it. Worse still, it never really looked as if they were even trying. And, my, did Scotland look as if they were. The disparity in effort was as heartbreaking as the disparity in effectiveness was devastating. But it gets worse again. Scotland came into this one with the high hopes not only of their own but of their northern cousins, who found them quite a handful in the Six Nations earlier this year. There had been a confidence about them, born of a mini-run of three consecutive away victories \u2013 dare we say it, there were even whispers that an upset might be on the cards, especially if the weather could oblige. Then, 26 minutes in on a crystal clear evening, the score read 28-3 to the All Blacks. Whispers there were none. Instead, just a stony silence, the game over. New Zealand are not everybody's favourite team but that is basically because they beat everyone else so often and sometimes so mercilessly. No one, though, with even a passing affection for the game of rugby union could fail to love what the All Blacks do with the ball when in this kind of form. And, as if they were not good enough, they now appear beyond doubt to have assimilated the talents of Sonny Bill Williams into their ranks. The rugby league convert has been talked up as one of the game's great off-loaders, not without reason. Everyone knows what he is going to do, but try wrestling that 6ft 3in, 17st frame to the floor, still less getting the ball off him. The stuff that happened round Williams represented the story of the game \u2013 a big guy in black holding the ball just out of reach of a swarm of guys in white, then flicking it to one of his mates, usually for a try. So, about those tries. Every one of them was a thing of beauty, every one of them made to look simple by the tirelessness and imagination of the runners on and off the ball. In the first half-hour, the All Blacks scored pretty much every time they got the ball. Scotland worked through plenty of phases, and Mike Blair was moving the ball away from the tackle with commendable speed and efficiency, but the weight of those tackles soon took its toll. The physicality quotient was painfully lopsided in the visitors' favour. Still, let it be said that Scotland took the lead with a Dan Parks penalty in the fourth minute. They actually won another a few minutes later, but Parks missed touch when going for the corner, and so the rout began. A few seconds later, Williams's first off-load of the night had Hosea Gear racing to the line. Easy. Shall we describe all the tries? Each one does merit a description of its own, but, equally, they were all constructed along similar lines \u2013 All Blacks running away, usually from floundering Scots who had just lost the ball at a shuddering contact, then an off-load or two, all rounded off by a try-scorer cantering away. Dan Carter got one three minutes after Gear's first, Mils Muliaina had his first seven minutes after that, and Gear's second brought up that 28-3 scoreline in only the 27th minute. It was hideous for those recently positive Scots. Things got worse when their captain and best player, Blair, was escorted from the pitch looking punch-drunk. But why pick on him? Everyone in the stadium not of Kiwi persuasion was feeling the same way. Then Muliaina went over for his second soon after half-time \u2013 in another sport things would have been stopped even earlier than they were. Scotland did contain things marginally more successfully in the second half (they conceded only three tries in that period), and their set piece looked pretty good throughout (until Euan Murray went off, anyway). But New Zealand scored two more in the last quarter of an hour, both imperious, both too, too easy. So the game ended early, with Dave Pearson, the referee, deciding that the result was fairly safe and that the medics needed as much time as possible to tend to the stricken Evans. He was driven off on a cart a few minutes later, his eyes firmly shut and an oxygen mask pressed to his face. A black, black night in every sense."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
