That demure look was soon gone \u2013 swinging 60s Sindy wore high white platform boots and black and white block-patterned mini dresses. Now the British owner of the Sindy brand is preparing a major relaunch to celebrate her 50th birthday. Exeter-based Pedigree Toys, which launched Sindy as the \"girl next door\" in 1963, four years after the birth of her bigger-busted rival Barbie, wants to license or share equity in the brand to restore it to its former glory. Since the 2008 demise of Woolworths, which held the exclusive licence to sell the dolls, Sindy has not appeared as a mass-market brand on the high street and has faded into obscurity. Sales, which peaked at \u00a364m in 1995, have dwindled to just \u00a33m-\u00a34m a year. In her heyday, Sindy ruled supreme in the UK, European and Commonwealth markets, achieving a UK market share of more than 80% in the late 1970s and early 80s. In the 80s, She had puffballs and evening dresses created by the Emanuels, the husband and wife team who designed Princess Diana's wedding dress. More than 150m Sindy dolls have been sold during the brand's history, and she was repeatedly a bestselling toy, both in the UK and overseas. But in the mid-1980s her Hollywood rival, Barbie, who was the dominant force in North and South America but had twice failed to break into Britain, made her triumphant entry, aided by the shoulder-padded fashion of the popular US television shows Dallas and Dynasty, and relegated Sindy to second place. Pedigree, then the girls' toy division of Lines Brothers, made the first \"fashion dolls\", such as \"Miss Debutante\", long before Barbie (11.5in tall) and Sindy (a petite 10.75in). It turned down Mattel's offer to distribute Barbie in the UK and launched Sindy instead. In the 1970s, Pedigree's then owner, Dunbee Combex Marx, took Sindy to the US and achieved a market share of 10%, but when DCM went into receivership the US operation was shut. In 1986 Pedigree teamed up with Hasbro, which remodelled Sindy to look more like Barbie in an attempt to take on Mattel in the US and elsewhere. This backfired when Mattel sued Hasbro for \"passing off\". Eventually the case was settled. In the late 90s Pedigree recovered the brand from Hasbro and relaunched Sindy with UK company Vivid Imaginations, in an attempt to take on Bratz - with limited success. However, after Woolworths relaunched Sindy in 2006 the doll and mini car set became the seventh bestselling toy in Britain. Barbie sales in the UK are currently up 23% year on year, which Jerry Reynolds, Pedigree's chief executive, believes bodes well for Sindy's relaunch next year. Unlike Bratz \u2013 the \"attitudinal, in-your-face\" brand that was popular a few years ago \u2013 Barbie and Sindy have a broader appeal and, crucially, cater for different age groups. Sindy is mainly aimed at pre-school girls while Barbie tends to be popular with older girls. Pedigree, which has turned from a toymaker into a company that focuses on publishing and third-party licensing, is considering a conventional distribution deal as well as awarding a master licence. Reynolds said: \"Increasingly retailers, especially large international retailers, are looking to have their own exclusive licences. Woolworths led in that area.\" After its ill-fated foray into the American market in the 1980s, Sindy's focus will be the UK and Europe this time round. The original dolls have become collectors' items, with some selling for as much as \u00a31,500. The Sindy trademark is registered or protected in 56 countries. Even if it cannot attract a partner, Pedigree is determined to push ahead with the relaunch and has already designed the 50th anniversary range \u2013 with the same innocent-looking big blue eyes that Sindy has always been famous for. Priced at about \u00a315, Sindy will have eyelash extensions, purple hair and light-blue legwarmers. She will have plenty of female friends but no boyfriend. In 1966, at the height of Beatlemania, a male doll called Paul was launched but Reynolds explained that Paul is now \"resting between engagements\". Boy dolls always pose challenges because creating short hair convincingly is hard as it tends to spike up. \"So long as Sindy (and Barbie) seem relevant and keep up with changing tastes and fashions, there is no reason to assume she won't be around for another 50 years,\" Reynolds added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
