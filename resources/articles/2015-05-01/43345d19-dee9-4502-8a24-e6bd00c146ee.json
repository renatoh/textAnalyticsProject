On Thursday, US Soccer distanced itself from Sepp Blatter further when it confirmed it will not vote for him in Friday\u2019s Fifa presidential elections. \u201cUS Soccer will vote for Prince Ali bin Al Hussein for next president of Fifa,\u201d said US Soccer\u2019s president, Sunil Gulati. \u201cThis is a vote for good governance and promise for our game.\u201d The US lost out to Qatar for the right to host the 2022 World Cup, and has hopes of hosting the tournament in the future as it looks to continue the growth of football in America. While Gulati acknowledged a vote against Blatter could count against a future bid, with Blatter still retaining strong support among many of the Fifa\u2019s 209 voters, he said he was comfortable with his decision. \u201cWould I like to see the United States host a World Cup in the future?\u201d Gulati said in the New York Times. \u201cThe answer is, of course, yes. But for me, and for US soccer, better governance and more integrity at Concacaf and Fifa are far more important than hosting any international soccer tournament.\u201d The US will instead put its support behind Blatter\u2019s sole rival for the Fifa presidency, Jordan\u2019s Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein. Prince Ali claims he can rely on at least 60 votes outside the European nations, while the Uefa president, Michel Platini says he can deliver 45 from within Europe. Blatter would need a two-thirds majority in the first round of voting, or an overall majority in the following rounds. Blatter still has strong support in Africa and Asia, as well as allies in Russia and Spain. Blatter has rejected calls that he should resign over the corruption scandal. \u201cI know many people hold me ultimately responsible for the actions and reputations of the global football community, whether it\u2019s a decision for the hosting of a World Cup or a corruption scandal,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cI cannot monitor everyone all of the time. If people want to do wrong, they will try to hide it. But it must fall to me to be ultimately responsible for the wellbeing of our organisation and find a way forward to fix things.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
