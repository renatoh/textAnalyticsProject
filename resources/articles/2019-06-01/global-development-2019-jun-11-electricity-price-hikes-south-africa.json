Like most black South Africans who grew up during apartheid, she was raised with gas stoves, candles and paraffin heaters. Her family\u2019s shack was poorly lit and smelled of fumes. \u201cElectricity was only for whites,\u201d says Rasmeni, 37. This changed when the African National Congress took office in 1994 and began a sweeping programme of service delivery. Within a few years, Rasmeni\u2019s neighbourhood in Khayelitsha, an informal settlement on the outskirts of Cape Town, had been hooked to the grid. \u201cEverything,\u201d Rasmeni recalls, \u201cwas so bright.\u201d But now a series of price hikes by the national utility, plagued by corruption and mismanagement under the ANC, is making electricity unaffordable for many of South Africa\u2019s people, pushing millions back into energy poverty, undermining more than two decades of progress and posing a range of health and safety risks. \u201cWe\u2019re going backwards,\u201d Rasmeni says, sitting outside the small shack where she now lives with her three children. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re living in the past.\u201d Electricity prices in South Africa have roughly tripled in real terms over the past decade, says Dirk de Vos, an energy analyst. Tariffs recently approved by the government will see prices rise by a further 25% in the next three years. The national utility, Eskom, produces about 95% of South Africa\u2019s electricity. It is currently more than 420bn rand (\u00a322bn) in debt, equivalent to about 8% of South Africa\u2019s GDP. A parliamentary investigation has revealed how Eskom was targeted by unscrupulous officials under the administration of former president Jacob Zuma, costing the utility billions and driving an exodus of skilled staff. Eskom has also featured prominently in an ongoing inquiry of alleged corruption at the highest levels of government, known locally as \u201cstate capture\u201d. The price hikes are part of an urgent strategy to revive the utility but have placed a growing burden on consumers, particularly those who cannot afford to supplement with renewable energy. \u201cFailure at the macro level is deepening inequality,\u201d says Lauren Hermanus, the founder of an energy consultancy called Adapt. About half of South Africa\u2019s population lives below the poverty line, with unemployment nearing 28%. The nation\u2019s income inequality ranks among the highest on earth. \u201cA privileged minority will be able to take care of themselves,\u201d Hermanus adds. \u201cPeople who can\u2019t will be incapacitated.\u201d While more than 90% of households nationally have access to electricity \u2013 nearly three times as many as at the end of apartheid \u2013 most poorer households continue using fuels like gas and paraffin, a phenomenon known as \u201cenergy stacking\u201d. \u201cWe are worried as a community,\u201d says Thandiwe Nyaba, a single mother who works as an informal trader in Khayelitsha. \u201cIf this carries on we will use electricity for lights only.\u201d Five years ago, she says, she could buy a month\u2019s electricity for less than about \u00a38. The same amount now lasts less than two weeks. High-voltage power lines cut through the area of Khayelitsha where she and Rasmeni live, a crowded section of government houses and shanties backing onto a national highway. Thinner cables, many of them illegal connections by shack dwellers, spider between the homes. With winter approaching in the southern hemisphere, many residents have begun burning paraffin to keep warm. \u201cAs long as the electricity [price] is up, people are buying,\u201d says Mohamed Huur, at the convenience shop on Rasmeni\u2019s corner. Paraffin is one of the leading causes of poisoning among South African children and a severe fire hazard. Each year, thousands of people are left homeless by fires in informal settlements. A fire last December destroyed hundreds of houses just three kilometres from where Rasmeni lives. \u201cIf people are swapping to paraffin and open flames, inherently the risk will increase,\u201d says Dr Richard Walls, head of the Fire Engineering Research Unit at Stellenbosch University. Two years ago, Rasmeni began using the fuel as she was no longer able to afford electricity for heating. Her youngest son, aged three, suffers from asthma, wheezing painfully when fumes fill the room. \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s going to die,\u201d says Rasmeni, who often rushes him to the nearest clinic for treatment. On a recent night they caught a taxi there but were turned away \u2013 crippling power outages, another symptom of Eskom\u2019s malaise, had struck Khayelitsha. \u201cWe think of the electricity crisis purely as impacting business and the economy, but there are widespread impacts on people and their health,\u201d says Dr Atiya Mosam from Wits University School of Public Health. \u201cThere\u2019s two issues,\u201d Mosam explains. \u201cParaffin and other fuels are harmful to communities, while having no electricity has other negative health consequences.\u201d These ranged from power failures affecting patient care at hospitals to blackouts making neighbourhoods less safe at night, \u201cincreasing the burden of injury and violence\u201d, Mosam says. \u201cEnergy is supposed to support socioeconomic development \u2013 if it isn\u2019t, you have to reform the system,\u201d says Jesse Burton, an energy researcher at the University of Cape Town. In May, the ANC won national elections, although suffered its worst-ever showing at the polls. South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has pledged to root out corruption and revive state enterprises like Eskom, but faces fierce opposition from a rival faction within his party. Rasmeni still remembers the 1994 elections, when her parents rose before dawn to vote. \u201cThey were voting for change,\u201d she says, \u201cand when electricity came we saw the change.\u201d This year, for the first time, she chose not support the ANC. \u201cYou see how we\u2019re living,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy must I vote?\u201d In her kitchen is a large electric oven that she has not used in two years. A two-burner gas stove is balanced on top of it. \u201cI used to be able to bake or make roasts,\u201d Rasmeni says, her gaze falling on the appliances. \u201cIt feels like being robbed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
