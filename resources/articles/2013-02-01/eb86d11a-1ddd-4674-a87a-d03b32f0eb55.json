Products such as beef dripping, stock cubes, steak, stewing steak and ready meals which contain beef that is not minced will be included in the testing for horse DNA, which will begin next week. Mary Creagh, the shadow environment secretary, emphasised speed was now of the essence: \"Labour has been calling for the FSA to get faster results and test more products for weeks, so I welcome the FSA's announcement. \"With cubed steak, kebabs, stock cubes and gelatine among those new products to be tested, there are indications that the horsemeat scandal could go even wider than previously thought. These new tests need to be done quickly \u2013 people want answers now.\" Parliamentary authorities admitted that four beef products \u2013 steak and kidney pie, beef and onion pie, steak and kidney suet pudding and beef Italian meatballs \u2013 had been withdrawn from the heavily subsidised eateries used by MPs, peers and staff. A Commons spokesman said the move was precautionary after one supplier, Brakes, announced it was carrying out tests. \"As a precautionary measure, the House of Commons catering service has removed from its shelves four beef items supplied by Brakes. This relates to meat derivative products rather than to fresh meat provided at the House of Commons,\" the spokesman said Tests on two of the four items had so far concluded negative for equine DNA, he said. \"The House of Commons catering service has followed all FSA advice and taken all necessary precautions and identified all products that contain beef. We will continue to be vigilant and, in line with FSA guidance, should we not be absolutely satisfied with the guarantees offered by suppliers we will undertake the necessary investigations and tests to give our customers the level of assurance demanded.\" Earlier, Nestl\u00e9, which has withdrawn beef and pasta products in Italy, Spain and France because of traces of horsemeat, said tests on its nine processed beef products available in the UK had found no equine contamination. The results of Nestl\u00e9 UK's tests on seven Jenny Craig weight-loss diet products and two Gerber baby foods were released a day after its parent company, the world's biggest food manufacturer, became implicated in the pan-European scandal. to the homes of customers as part of a weight-loss programme costing nearly \u00a3250 a Among the seven Jenny Craig dishes that contain processed beef are lasagne, chilli con carne and bolognese. Jenny Craig said: \"We can confirm Nestl\u00e9 has tested samples of all of its processed beef products sold in the UK and Ireland, as prioritised by the FSA \u2026 Today we have received the results of our internal tests, which have confirmed no presence of horse DNA in any of these products.\" The company added: \"Nestl\u00e9 UK is part of the industry reporting process and these results will be submitted via the Food and Drink Federation, our industry body, to the FSA in this week's reporting cycle. We will continue to test our products in accordance with the FSA's priorities and the results will be reported to the FSA.\" The test results were not among the first batch submitted by retailers and manufacturers to the FSA last week. Nestl\u00e9 UK said no supplies from a subcontractor implicated in products withdrawn in mainland Europe were involved in UK products. On Monday, the company's head office in Switzerland said horsemeat levels found in two products sold in France and Spain were \"above the 1% threshold the UK's Food Standards Agency uses to indicate likely adulteration or gross negligence\". The Buitoni products affected were tested between 11 and 17 February. Nestl\u00e9 has suspended deliveries of all products using beef supplied by a German firm, HJ Schypke, a subcontractor of one of its suppliers, JBS Toledo, based in Belgium, which boasts of the traceability of its raw materials. Nestl\u00e9 said when reports emerged in the UK about the \"fraudulent mislabelling\" of beef, it enhanced testing of products and the raw materials used across Europe. \"Our tests have found traces of horse DNA in two products made from beef supplied by HJ Schypke \u2026 Therefore we are voluntarily removing two chilled pasta products, Buitoni beef ravioli and beef tortellini, from sale in Italy and Spain immediately, and we will replace them with product confirmed by DNA testing to be made from 100% beef. Lasagnes \u00e0 la bolognaise gourmandes, a frozen meat product for catering businesses by Nestl\u00e9 Professional produced in France, will also be withdrawn from sale and replaced with product made from 100% beef.\" The company would add new tests on beef for horse DNA prior to production in Europe. ADDJBS Toledo, in Ghent, is part of a large Brazilian multinational JBS, which said it too had suspended contracts with HJ Schykpeand would not cease marketing European meat until confidence was restored in the European beef supply chain. Jeremiah O'Callaghan, its investor relations director in S\u00e3o Paulo, said: \"In this specific case, from the outset of supply, all operational and logistical processes were carried out by the German supplier who delivered the product to the final client.\" JBS Toledo \"has suspended all its contracts with Schypke and will not market European meat until confidence is restored in the European beef supply chain\", he said. JBS would take \"all necessary legal measures\" to make sure that no losses were incurred as a consequence of this \"isolated occurence\". HJSchypke in Steinfeld-M\u00fchlen in Lower Saxony, Germany, denied having knowingly bought horse meat or slaughtered horses. The company said it was \"solely a processing production plant. Slaughtering and dismantling meat are not carried out here\". Schypke was working closely with the authorities in the hope of reaching a \"swift explanation\" to the scandal, adding that it would now carry out DNA tests on all meat products. The company said it bought its meat in an already butchered state, \"fresh or as deep-frozen uncooked fare from certified suppliers\". It sourced meat from Germany, Europe and south America. Its South American meat came from organic suppliers, the company added. Meanwhile, the head of frozen food chain Iceland, Malcolm Walker, has apologised to Irish authorities after responding when asked on the BBC's Panorama programme why his company's burgers passed British tests for horse DNA but failed Irish testing, Walker replied: \"Well, that's the Irish, isn't it?\" After Professor Alan Reilly, chief executive of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, said it was \"unprofessional that a vested interest would seek to undermine our position with misinformation and speculation\", Walker's company said he and Iceland \"were deeply sorry for any offence\".
