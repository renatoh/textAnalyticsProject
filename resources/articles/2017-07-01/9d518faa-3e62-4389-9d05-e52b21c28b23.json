Officials: no he didn't", "bodyText": "Elon Musk does not have government approval to build a Hyperloop tunnel from New York City to Washington DC. The Tesla executive took to Twitter this morning to tantalize his legion of fans and the tech press with the \u201cnews\u201d that he had \u201cjust received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins \u2026 City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city.\u201d Lest any billionaires need to brush up on civics 101: the US system of government does not operate on \u201cverbal government approvals\u201d. Musk walked back his claim about 90 minutes later, tweeting: \u201cStill a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly\u201d. A lot of work is needed to receive formal approval, indeed. Musk was received with typical credulity by the tech press, and considerable consternation by various government agencies. Several spokespeople who answered the phones at relevant city, state and federal government bodies laughed upon hearing of the claim that an interstate transit project with a significant street-level footprint in four of the east coast\u2019s largest cities could be approved verbally. \u201cWho gave him permission to do that?\u201d asked a spokesman with the Maryland department of transportation. \u201cElon Musk has had no contact with Philadelphia officials on this matter,\u201d said Mike Dunn, the city spokesman. \u201cWe do not know what he means when he says he received \u2018verbal government approval\u2019. There are numerous hurdles for this unproven \u2018hyperloop\u2019 technology before it can become reality.\u201d A spokesperson for the state of Pennsylvania confirmed that neither the governor nor the state\u2019s department of transportation had been contacted by Musk or his company. Ben Sarle, a spokesman for the New York City mayor\u2019s office, said in an email: \u201cNobody in City Hall, or any of our city agencies, has heard from Mr Musk or any representatives of his company.\u201d \u201cThe New York state department of transportation did not give verbal approval for a hyperloop,\u201d said spokeswoman Jennifer Post. Anthony McCarthy, the spokesman for the Baltimore mayor, Catherine Pugh, said: \u201cMr Musk\u2019s announcement on Twitter was the first that the city heard of the Hyperloop project. \u201d However, Pugh said in a statement that she was \u201cexcited\u201d to hear about the idea, which could \u201ccreate new opportunities for Baltimore and transform the way we link to neighboring cities\u201d \u2013 if it becomes a reality. Similarly, LaToya Foster, the spokeswoman for Washington DC mayor Muriel Bowser, said: \u201cThis is the first we heard of it . We can\u2019t wait to hear more.\u201d Spokespeople for other state and federal regulators said they were getting numerous calls about Musk\u2019s claims but did not yet have any information to share. \u201cI really have no idea,\u201d said Ben Fritsch, spokesman for Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents Washington DC and sits on the House transportation committee. What Musk does seem to have had are informal discussions with White House officials about his proposal for an east coast Hyperloop, a system of underground vacuum tubes through which trains or pods could be shot at high speeds. A White House spokesperson confirmed that officials had had \u201cpromising conversations\u201d with Musk and executives from the Boring Company, adding that the White House is \u201ccommitted to transformative infrastructure projects, and believe our greatest solutions have often come from the ingenuity and drive of the private sector\u201d. Which is great for everyone who dreams of futuristic transportation options along the eastern seaboard. But the difference between a billionaire businessman\u2019s \u201cpromising conversations\u201d with a country\u2019s executive branch and \u201cformal approval\u201d is the difference between an oligarchy and a representative democracy. Sam Teller, a spokesman for the Boring Company, said the company had had \u201ca number of promising conversations with local, state and federal government officials\u201d, though he declined to comment on which localities were included, so it is unclear whether any of them were even on the New York to DC route. Teller also said the company had \u201creceived verbal support from key government decision makers for tunneling plans\u201d and \u201cexpect to secure the formal approvals necessary to break ground later this year\u201d. Infrastructure projects in the US generally require approval by elected officials and regulatory bodies, significant planning and environmental review, and opportunities for public engagement and comment. Musk did not respond to questions about whether he planned to purchase the land on the route he\u2019s proposing or seek easements \u2013 another lengthy and bureaucratic process. \u201cThere is just a gigantic environment of people that this project would be required to work with,\u201d said Madeline Brozen, associate director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, noting that the Hyperloop would be considered a \u201cmega project\u201d that would require collaboration with cities, states, the federal government, railroad authorities and other agencies. \u201cThere is no such thing as a verbal environmental approval,\u201d she added. \u201cThe government really wants to be very careful about how they permit and allow projects, and a verbal agreement is not how that process works.\u201d It\u2019s also important to note that the concept of a Hyperloop remains largely theoretical. While two companies have worked on developing the technology, they have yet to release working models to the public. This is not the first time that Musk has made dubious claims about his ability to dig tunnels wherever he wants on Twitter. In January, he announced his intention to start digging a tunnel to ease traffic in Los Angeles within \u201ca month or so\u201d. In reality, he was planning to drill a tunnel near his SpaceX office in the city of Hawthorne, near the Los Angeles airport, and had not yet received any permits or approvals from city, county or state agencies. Musk did not respond to questions about the motivation behind his bombastic claims, but the tweets obviously succeeded in generating significant press coverage for him and his company. His initial statement about \u201cverbal govt approval\u201d has been retweeted more than 34,000 times. The follow-up tweet acknowledging a lack of \u201cformal approval\u201d has been retweeted less than 1,000 times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
