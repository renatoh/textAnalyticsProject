The consumer campaigning group says that more than 70 per cent of the policies it looked at were likely to give policyholders 80 per cent of the pension they would have received if they had stayed in the state scheme. The survey follows an article in Cash two weeks ago highlighting the problems of contracting out. Norwich Union and HSBC have moved their pension policyholders back into S2P in the past two years. Which? said that around 10 per cent of the \u00a335 billion paid to the pensions industry by the government to invest on behalf of those who opted out has gone into providers' and advisers' charges. It also concluded that people over 50 are the most likely to have lost out, as are those who contracted out after 1997, when National Insurance rebates became age-related.
