Republican Senate candidates swept the south, hastening the death of the region's Democratic tradition. Louisiana elected its first Republican senator since the late 19th century. Democrats also lost seats in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. To cap the Democrats' humiliation, their Senate leader, Tom Daschle, was ousted in South Dakota after serving four terms, despite spending $18m (\u00a39.7m) - a Senate record - to fend off his Republican challenger, John Thune. The Republican bloc in the Senate now numbers 55, while the Democrats have been reduced to 44 seats and one independent who usually votes with them. The Republican edge in the House of Representatives has also increased. Almost all the new Republican senators are cultural conservatives. Perhaps the most extreme example is Tom Coburn from Oklahoma, who called for the death penalty for anyone performing abortions and claimed to have heard that there was \"rampant lesbianism\" in the state's schools. He defeated his Democratic challenger despite calling state legislators \"crapheads\", and the revelation that, as a doctor in 1990, he failed to report an operation to sterilise a woman, who claimed she had not given her consent. The Republican tide was also exemplified by the re-election of Jim Bunning in Kentucky, whose behaviour became erratic on the campaign trail. He said his Democratic opponent resembled one of Saddam Hussein's sons, admitted he neither read nor watched the news, and tried to dodge a face-to-face debate. In Florida, the Republican Senate candidate, Mel Martinez, helped swing Hispanic voters behind the president by running as a social conservative with anti-abortion views. In South Carolina, Jim DeMint won the former Democratic seat by promising to abolish federal income tax and the internal revenue service. Even before this election, the House was conservative and Tuesday's vote deepened that trend. But the president's initiatives ran into trouble in the Senate in his first term, as moderate Republicans from the north-east made common cause with Democrats. One of those, Lincoln Chafee from Rhode Island, said he would not vote for the president and would consider defecting. His departure would reduce the Republican majority but it would also enhance the party's ideological cohesion. The Republican senators were elected on a platform of opposition to abortion and gay marriage, setting the stage for a fight over control of the supreme court, which will define federal law on both issues. With the retirement of the chief justice, William Rehnquist, imminent and the departure of two or three more judges likely in the next few years, Republican conservatives will see this term as an opportunity to shape the judiciary for decades to come. While the Democrats have been diminished they are still strong enough to block court nominees they do not like by mounting a filibuster, but the question is whether, after the election, the Democrats have the confidence to challenge the president's hegemony."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
