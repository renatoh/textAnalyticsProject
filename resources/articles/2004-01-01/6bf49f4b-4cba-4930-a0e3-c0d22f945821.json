Most parents ask permission, but by the time they do it's usually a fait accompli - they've already booked the tickets. If you say no, they'll just say, \"We are taking them anyway\". 'I'm not sure if a \u00a3100 fine will be much of a deterrent if you are saving \u00a31,000 on the cost of the holiday by travelling in term time. And who's going to enforce it? Teachers don't want to get involved in reporting people to the authorities.' Keith Urro, headteacher, Lew Trenchard Primary School, Okehampton, Devon 'I try to consider each case on its merits. I'm usually quite sympathetic because we work in an agricultural community where people don't go on holiday that often and earnings are not that great, so people often need to look for cheaper deals. I think up to two weeks [out of term time] in a year is acceptable and a holiday can broaden horizons. We always advise children to keep a diary of their holiday so there is an educational element. 'We have noticed an increase in the number of people taking their children away during term time, but it's not to an extent where it's disrupting classes and if you take a look at what travel firms charge during school holidays, it is very unfair.' Glenys Ingham, headteacher, Myatt Garden Primary School, Brockley, London 'Whoever dreamt up the idea of fining parents for taking children out of school must be living in make-believe land. What sort of relationship am I going to have with parents if I have to start wrangling with them over fines? 'Generally, I do think it's bad practice to take children out of school during term time but we live in a very multicultural area and a lot of our children have family in Africa and the West Indies, which are not places you can go for a long weekend. If a parent wants to take a child to attend a special family event and it's a one-off, we try to be accommodating. 'This year has been the worst I've ever known for children taking time off. Instead of asking schools to deal with it, the Government should be looking at the travel industry and asking why it's so much more expensive to travel during school holidays.' Parents Sarah de Souza, mother of four children aged 15, 10, six and four 'I don't think twice about taking my kids out of school if it is the end of a main term such as the last week before Christmas or the week before the summer holidays when they are all watching videos of Bugsy Malone and Spiderman at school. Sometimes going away a few days before the start of the school holidays makes a big difference in price. I have just been looking at booking a flight to Florida at Easter and if I book three days before the school holidays start, the price is \u00a3189 compared with \u00a3379 when school breaks up. 'I would think twice about taking my 15-year-old out of school because of her GCSEs. Sometimes in the past my husband has not been able to get time off in the school holidays. If you have a professional person in the family who sometimes does 80-hour weeks and they can't get time off in school holidays, you would never see them.' Emma Mahony, mother of three children aged five and two and author of Double Trouble: Twins and How To Survive Them 'I have no qualms about taking my five-year-old, Humphrey, out of school in term time. When he was at a state school there was a standard letter saying it was disapproved of, but the teachers said to do a travel diary so privately teachers had a different opinion to the standard line. 'I went to Morocco with my three kids and mother in late September. My mum paid for us to go on the trip. She could not have afforded to have taken us all if it was not in the middle of the term. Humphrey is now at a private school where the attitude to holidaying in term time is more relaxed. The teacher said it was fine. She was all for travel for kids of that age.' Shirley Gates, mother of two children aged eight and 10 and owner of a nursery school and after-school club 'Many schools seem to be quite flexible at the moment if you tell them you are going away. Originally you could take your kids out of school for two weeks, which benefited parents because many find holidays too expensive in peak times, so would not be able to go away at all. Parents need holidays and need to spend quality time with their children. Children gain so much from holidays, they experience a new country, are exposed to a different language and it can be as educational as school. If term time is the only chance they have to experience this, giving a fine is a bit unfair. 'Regarding the introduction of a new six-term year, our children's school sent a letter to all the parents asking if they would prefer that structure and most thought it was a good idea. It would give people more leeway, so I think it would be better. The six-week summer holi day is just too long, many parents can't afford to go away and it's very difficult to juggle child care. Many can't afford to pay for their kids to join schemes or after-school clubs for the whole period, so end up staying at home, and the children get bored. They also get very tired during the long term times. 'I read an article in Nursery World magazine which suggested children with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) could benefit from more frequent, shorter holidays, as one of the main triggers is too much pressure at school. It would be a better solution than medication.' Travel companies Martin Garland, of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, which represents 150 companies 'Tour operators' holiday charges are fair. They take into account the huge annual investment involved, producing and dispatching glossy brochures free to thousands of consumers; owning holiday accommodation for 52 weeks while letting it for, say, only 20; paying suppliers (accommodation owners, coach operators, airlines, hoteliers, etc) in advance for the entire season (April/ October) to ensure availabil ity during the peak weeks; training reservations staff; advertising. 'It's also about seasonality for each destination and the law of supply and demand. Mauritius is significantly cheaper in August (with great family offers) than other times of the year; the Caribbean is expensive throughout February - not just half-term. European destinations have a shorter season - August is when demand exists and when suppliers need to recoup their investment costs. 'Most pricing is driven by supplier contracts - there is absolutely no desire to exploit consumers, but there is a limited supply of the specialist type of product.' George Elles, of the Association of British Tour Operators to France and Canvas Holidays 'In the family holiday market people can only go away at certain times of the year. You have to target your prices to that time of year because the rest of the year you won't fill it with families. For example, at Canvas we have to look at other markets in continental Europe to fill our camp sites at other times. I don't think holidays are overpriced. We are seeing a reflection of tour operators trying to make a margin when they can. 'Parents will have a lot more choice of when to go away when the school year changes to a new format. Tour operators will have to change their price schedules. Having six terms means you will see a big spread of when you can go away. But it would be false to think people will drop their prices.' Chris Woodbridge-Cox, of Club Med 'In simple terms, it comes down to supply and demand. If you risk chartering an aircraft, you cannot just sell six weeks of the summer because you are buying a plane for 26 weeks. Theoretically you could have flat prices for six months, but that means you would sell July and August and never sell the rest of the season and we would all go out of business. 'The change in school terms will be interesting. Instead of six weeks of peak prices you will get more peaks with hopefully lower prices. Demand will be stretched out from early July to September, so theoretically you will be able to bring prices down.' Keith Betton, Association of British Travel Agents 'The justification is that there are only a certain amount of times and flights available in school holidays, and in a free market economy prices do go up.' Judith de Witt, of Rainbow Tours, which specialises in long-haul holidays to Africa 'It seems to me that some big tour operators use a lot of hotels throughout the year and then in a magic 10 weeks make a killing. They could adjust their prices across the year to make it a bit more fair. It is madness that the whole of Britain tries to get out by plane or car on the same Friday in July.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
