But my eye was taken by an iPad that sat on a counter at the entrance, with a typed little note: \u201cHere is a glimpse of what you\u2019re missing over at the main terminal right now.\u201d The screen linked to videos of travelers looking harassed and being swallowed into pushing, shoving paparazzi scrums \u2013 routine hazards for the 80 million people who pass through LAX each year. \u201cThere they process thousands of people at a time, they\u2019re barking. It\u2019s loud. Here it\u2019s very, very lovely,\u201d said Gavin de Becker, who runs the new terminal, called Private Suite. He wasn\u2019t wrong. The $22m facility, the first of its kind in the US, opens on Monday, giving the 1% a whole new way to separate themselves from everyone else\u2019s reality. The iPad was not a live feed to the main public terminal nor intended as a permanent feature. After publication, de Becker contacted the Guardian to clarify that the video was installed temporarily for the Guardian\u2019s visit and was not for public display. It showed a compilation of clips from LAX culled from YouTube. Luxury, de Becker said while giving the Guardian a tour, is secondary to convenience \u2013 to escaping the hassle of modern air travel. \u201cThe real purpose here is logistics.\u201d He reckons about a tenth of his clients will be celebrities who are fed up with the paparazzi staking out LAX. The rest will be corporate \u2013 CEOs and other members of capitalism\u2019s top brass. De Becker, who runs a security consulting firm, borrowed the concept from Heathrow\u2019s Windsor Suite, a marbled sanctuary for popes, presidents and other VIPs tucked in a corner of Terminal 5. Instead of battling the traffic jams that clog LAX you reach Private Suite via the Imperial Highway, leading to a discreet turn-off where an armed guard checks your identity and pushes a button. Tall grey gates open and you enter the haven. It is pricey. In addition to annual membership of $7,500, you pay $2,700 per domestic flight and $3,000 per international flight. The cost covers a group of up to four people. If you aren\u2019t a member, you pay $3,500 for a domestic flight and $4,000 for international flight for a group of up to three people. There are 13 suites, each with bathrooms, televisions, drinks, organic snacks, wifi, gadgets and views of planes trundling across runways. There are menus of toys for children and prayer mats for Muslims. If you spill some cabernet, no worries: pick up the phone and within minutes a man in a blazer will wheel in a cart with Calvin Klein socks, Banana Republic dress shirts, Anne Klein blouses and Steve Madden shoes. If the weather at your destination looks a bit damp help yourself to a water-resistant jacket. Another man in a blazer will check in your luggage and let you know when it is time to leave your suite and enter the \u201cgallery\u201d, a mini-terminal disguised as a hotel lounge. It is decorated with rotating art installations \u2013 currently it is a series of humming bird portraits by the photographer Gary Yost \u2013 which you can buy, with proceeds going to charity. When it is time to leave a TSA agent from the main terminal will pop over to screen you and any companions. A BMW will then whisk you to your plane. Arrivals receive the same treatment, with leather armchairs and platters of chocolates flanking the customs and immigration desk. De Becker rebuffed any suggestion that his terminal symbolised inequality. It cost taxpayers nothing and would generate $34m for LAX over the next nine years, he said. Plus it would make his clients likelier to use commercial flights rather than charter private jets. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the airport, about predictability. When you charter you can buy your way out of the line.\u201d So Private Suite was an egalitarian advance? De Becker nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a voluntary tax on the wealthy.\u201d America\u2019s most famous socialist, he suggested, would approve. \u201cI love Bernie Sanders.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 16 May 2017 to make clear that the iPad that was located on the counter at the entrance to the Private Suite was not a live feed and was a compilation of clips from LAX culled from YouTube. Those clips related to paparazzi scrums that had been experienced in the past at LAX. Subsequently, it has been clarified to us that the iPad is not a feature at the terminal and is not for public display, but rather was displayed only during the Guardian\u2019s visit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
