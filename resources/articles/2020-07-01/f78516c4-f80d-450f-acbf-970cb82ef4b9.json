Guardiola wants two weeks' training to prepare for Real Madrid", "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola has said he will make a few changes when Manchester City travel to Watford on Tuesday for their penultimate league game of the season. The City manager is already looking forward to the visit of Real Madrid in the Champions League once the domestic season is over, and while Zinedine Zidane has promised to give his players some time to rest in the meantime, Guardiola intends to spend a fortnight preparing for the game. City lead Spain\u2019s league champions 2-1 on aggregate going into the second leg of their last-16 tie, which they host, on 7 August. \u201cWe will carry on training when the league season finishes, we will be able to devote two weeks to working on a specific way to play Real Madrid,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cThey are now going to have to play without Sergio Ramos so we will have to try and work out the way they are going to play. We have to improve our own performance too. \u201cWe had enough chances to score against Arsenal at Wembley [in Saturday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final] but we didn\u2019t take them. I\u2019m sure we will be able to create chances against Real Madrid, but if we don\u2019t take them we\u2019ll be out. Generally though I feel positive. I\u2019m excited to be able to prepare for a game against Real Madrid, with the players we have I am optimistic about making it into the next round.\u201d Guardiola also admitted that a fifth season at Manchester City will be a challenge but anticipates bringing in some new players to help freshen the side. \u201cI have never been five years in one club as manager, but I know you face different challenges if you stay for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to try and make small changes, perhaps attack in different way, but it all depends on the players that we have next season. \u201cNew players who may join us will help with changing the freshness of the team. We are not going to bring in eight or nine players, that would be impossible. I would say around 85% of the team will stay the same but I am expecting to have some new faces around by next season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
