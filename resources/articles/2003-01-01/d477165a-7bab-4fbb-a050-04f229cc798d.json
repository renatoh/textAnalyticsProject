Part of the building in Hackney, east London, was already on fire at around 5pm today when police fired the CS rounds into an area away from the blaze where they believe 32-year-old gunman Eli Hall is hiding. Earlier today there was an exchange of fire between the gunman and armed officers. Mr Hall fired three shots at police from the second floor of the premises at about 9.15am and armed officers from the Metropolitan Police fired one shot in response. Police first noticed smoke coming from the second floor of the building soon after the shots were fired this morning. They then shot out the windows with baton rounds and used fire brigade hoses to bring the fire under control. But then police commander Bob Quick said this afternoon that the fire - previously brought under control by officers - had re-established itself. Mr Hall has been burning furniture to stay warm since police ordered that his gas, electricity and water be cut off nearly a week ago. The developments come on the 15th day of the siege, Britain's longest running standoff in recent years. Speaking at the scene earlier today, Mr Quick told reporters that officers initially put the blaze out at \"some personal risk\" using fire brigade equipment. He described half the flat as permeated by smoke. Mr Quick added that he now had concerns about the structural integrity of the building and that London fire brigade technicians were investigating. He said: \"We have not seen any signs of life from the suspect ... part of the building has been relatively unaffected by the fire and he could have sought refuge.\" The officer said the gunman was likely to have inhaled a \"considerable amount\" of smoke but that he could have survived the fire. The development comes as the siege enters its 15th day, making it one of the longest in recent memory. Mr Quick revealed yesterday that negotiations with the gunman had taken a step backwards and that the gunman had adopted a \"very entrenched\" position. Police said dialogue with the suspect had broken down last night, and nothing had been heard from him until he fired on an armed control point this morning. Officers had previously believed that negotiations were proving effective, raising hopes that the siege could be resolved peacefully. Police said they are now consolidating their position and reviewing the situation to help bring the siege to a peaceful end. \"We remain committed to ending this without injury to anyone, and we are reviewing a range of options to bring it to a safe conclusion. We continue to use a loud hailer to implore the man to leave the premises safely,\" they said in a statement. Mr Hall is believed to have two handguns and a cache of ammunition inside the flat. A hostage he had held for 11 days made a dramatic escape on Sunday afternoon. The man, who is in his late 20s, has been de-briefed by police. The siege has caused disruption in Hackney, with the closure of four streets and the deployment of specialist armed officers in a round-the-clock operation. About 43 people have been trapped inside their homes near the scene since the siege began."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
