Steve McClaren's side thereby avoid being paired with a side dropping out from the Champions League in the first round of the New Year knockout stage when they will, instead, face a third-placed Uefa group qualifier. Perhaps even more encouragingly, Boro undid a Partizan side who arrived aiming to ex tend a 25-game unbeaten run courtesy of goals from Szilard Nemeth, Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Job and James Morrison, three customary second-stringers. \"I left Mark Viduka and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink on the bench because I can't just keep playing the same XI,\" explained McClaren. \"My squad players have got very important roles to play here and I've got to give them chances.\" McClaren's faith in his understudies was swiftly vindicated when another helped create Nemeth's opener, Doriva's pass picking out Job before the Cameroon striker's through-ball was met by the Slovakian who had timed his run impeccably. Nevertheless, the failure of Ivica Kralj, Partizan's goalkeeper, to spread himself properly assisted the forward's somewhat tame shot. Having endured several more alarming moments Kralj was eventually replaced by Djorde Pantic after complaining of feeling unwell. At least Nemeth's opener should have eased the scorer's paranoia about his colleagues' perceived failure to give him the ball. Nemeth has used his personal website to protest that team-mates excluded him from passing triangles while McClaren's coaches were biased against him. Evidently not a man to harbour grudges, he displayed his gratitude by creating Boro's second goal for Job. It originated with Franck Queudrue overlapping from left-back and beating his man before cutting in and squaring to Nemeth whose ensuing pass cued Job up for a first-time shot beyond Kralj. If Boro were slightly lucky that Ray Parlour escaped with a booking for an apparent over the top tackle on Nemanja Rnic, so Pierre Boya seemed a little fortunate to see yellow rather than red after elbowing Colin Cooper in the face. Meanwhile Queudrue's hard but clean penalty-area tackle on Sasa Ilic almost certainly came between Partizan's captain and a goal. Such forays apart, Partizan - vanquishers of Newcastle in last year's Champions League qualifying round - often seemed undone by their excessively overlapping full-backs who left gaping spaces for Parlour and Stewart Downing to exploit. Yet although Nemeth spurned a potential hat-trick by missing two sitters, the Serbians' fluid system, at times left McClaren's players looking unsure as to who exactly they should be minding. Indeed with substitute Simon Vukcevic threatening on the right and Ilic flashing a half-volley wide, Boro sporadically wobbled. Enter Morrison. Emphasising that McClaren's second-stringers cannot be ignored the substitute registered a late third courtesy of an exhilarating run and angled left-foot shot into the bottom corner. \"A job well done,\" enthused McClaren."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
