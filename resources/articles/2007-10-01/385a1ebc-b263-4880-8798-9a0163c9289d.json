The Commons European scrutiny committee said the new legal draft suggested the UK could only remain outside the jurisdiction of the European court of justice for five years on justice and home affairs issues, and after that might face serious consequences if it decided not to accept ECJ jurisdiction. In a letter to the foreign secretary, David Miliband, the committee warned that if the UK did not accept the jurisdiction, all EU measures adopted so far would cease to apply, and Britain would risk incurring \"a potentially unlimited financial responsibility\". At present Britain can choose to opt in to justice and home affairs issues, such as the European arrest warrant, but is not required to accept ECJ jurisdiction. The Foreign Office rejected the analysis from what it privately regards as a Eurosceptic select committee. The intervention came as Gordon Brown met the European commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, in Downing Street, with the two men exuding confidence that the British red lines would be preserved. Mr Barroso said: \"I have every reason to believe that the opt-outs that were so hard fought for by Britain are going to be kept in the text. Now we need to have this matter settled and move forward.\" He said he fully respected the British opt-outs, and insisted, as a former constitutional lawyer, that the new treaty was not a reworking of the former constitution, as the Conservatives insist. Mr Brown said: \"I believe we have succeeded in our negotiating objectives. If we were not to achieve our red lines, we could not accept the amending treaty.\" But he added: \"I'm a cautious man and I will wait until we see the discussion which takes place in the council next week before I make a final judgment on this.\" It also became clear yesterday that the prime minister will veto the draft treaty if he is unhappy with it. He said that without the opt-outs, Britain \"could not accept\" the treaty. The tenor of yesterday's meeting between Mr Brown and Mr Barroso suggested neither man expects a row at the summit focusing on Britain. They would prefer the summit to focus on climate change, terrorism and restarting trade talks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
