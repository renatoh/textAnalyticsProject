His memoirs are gossipy, entertaining and not likely to be enjoyed much by those he served at the time. The prime minister is accused of shallowness and a failure to use his leverage with the Americans; Jack Straw is depicted as weak and ineffectual. It must indeed have been hugely entertaining to listen to John Prescott arguing with Dick Cheney about Balkan complexities. John Major fares a bit, though not much, better. Ironically, when Tony Blair had to find a new ambassador in Washington, Sir Christopher was ruled out by the Foreign Office as he had just been posted to Bonn. It was the prime minister who insisted that Meyer was the best man for the job. He served with distinction in Washington. Towards the end of the Clinton years, he kept in touch with key Republicans including the governor of Texas, George Bush. He served as a very useful bridge when Bush emerged as the victor in the presidential election. Tony Blair, even then, was widely respected in America - not least for pushing a reluctant Clinton administration to take the steps needed to put an end to Serb aggression in Kosovo. Amid the heat and fury about Iraq, it tends to be forgotten that Blair's first military commitment alongside George Bush was to help rid Afghanistan of the Taliban. Sir Christopher is more admiring of the Bushes than the Blairs. The two principal architects of avoidable disaster in Iraq, Messrs Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, emerge unscathed from this account. Meyer supported the war. Blair pushed the Americans to take the UN route over Iraq until, thanks to France, it ran into a dead end. A huge effort was invested in persuading the president to back negotiations, or at least disengagement, between Israel and Palestine. On the caricature of the prime minister as a \"poodle\", Meyer acknowledges that he acted out of conviction that the authority of the UN was being fatally undermined - as indeed it was, not least through the corruption of the so-called oil for food programme. The difficulty with a memoir of this kind is the question it raises about the supposedly confidential nature of the relationship between ministers and the diplomatic service. Ambassadors are not powerless. Convinced that our policy in Bosnia was doomed to failure, I did my best to get it changed. Nor was it ever resented to argue quite fiercely at times with Margaret Thatcher because she knew that, unlike some of her colleagues, I would not be talking to the press. Sir Christopher has published the book we all would have loved to write about bumbling ministers, feckless royals and mistakes which, in retrospect, clearly should have been avoided. The difficulty in actually doing so is that it is liable to worsen the tendency he deplores of prime minister's relying increasingly on their personal staffs and political appointees, rather than on the mandarins who are supposed to advise them behind closed doors. \"Put not your trust in princes,\" says Meyer. You had better not put them in ambassadors either, will be the response of many politicians. \u00b7 Lord Renwick served as ambassador to Washington from 1991-1995 \u00b7 If you wish to respond, at greater length than in a letter, to an article in which you have featured either directly or indirectly, email response@theguardian.com or write to Response, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.
