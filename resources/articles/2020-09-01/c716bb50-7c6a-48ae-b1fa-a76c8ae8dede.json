The attempts by Dr Paul Alexander \u2013 who serves as a senior adviser to Michael Caputo, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) assistant public affairs secretary \u2013 were described in emails obtained by Politico. Alexander reportedly told media liaisons at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) about what Fauci should discuss during interviews. Alexander opined on Fauci\u2019s possible responses to inquiries from publications such as Bloomberg News, HuffPost and BuzzFeed. \u201cI continue to have an issue with kids getting tested and repeatedly and even university students in a widespread manner \u2026 and I disagree with Dr Fauci on this. Vehemently,\u201d Alexander wrote in a 27 August email, in response to a press office rundown of Fauci\u2019s planned remarks to Bloomberg. In an email Tuesday, Alexander also told Fauci\u2019s spokesperson that he should not advocate mask-wearing by children in a planned MSNBC sit-down. \u201cCan you ensure Dr Fauci indicates masks are for the teachers in schools. Not for children,\u201d Alexander reportedly said in this email. \u201cThere is no data, none, zero, across the entire world, that shows children, especially young children, spread this virus to other children, or to adults or to their teachers. None. And if it did occur, the risk is essentially zero.\u201d While Alexander\u2019s long missives were framed as scientific concerns, they routinely contrasted with mainstream science. The messages also boosted Trump\u2019s opinions on controversial topics involving coronavirus, such as school reopenings and using convalescent plasma, Politico noted. The cache of emails provide more evidence that Trump and his HHS appointees are telling health officials to push political messaging over scientific information. Caputo reportedly said in a statement that Fauci is a key voice amid the public health crisis, claiming Alexander\u2019s focus is assessing other scientists\u2019 work. Caputo appointed Alexander, a part-time professor of health research methods, in March. \u201cDr Alexander advises me on pandemic policy and he has been encouraged to share his opinions with other scientists,\u201d Caputo\u2019s statement said. \u201cLike all scientists, his advice is heard and taken or rejected by his peers. I hired Dr Alexander for his expertise and not to simply resonate others\u2019 opinions.\u201d Fauci, who has helmed NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for almost 40 years, said that he hadn\u2019t seen Alexander\u2019s emails. Fauci also said that his staff did not tell him to downplay Covid-19\u2019s risks to children. \u201cNo one tells me what I can say and cannot say,\u201d Fauci reportedly commented. \u201cI speak on scientific evidence.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
