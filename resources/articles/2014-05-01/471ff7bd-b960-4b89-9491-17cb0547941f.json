It was 1972 and that evening was the last time she saw her mother alive. After campaigning tenaciously for 20 years to bring Jean McConville's killers to justice, McKendry \u2013 now 57 \u2013 believes it is time to cooperate with the police regardless of any potential retribution. Her defiance comes in contrast to her brother, Michael, who expressed fears that he and other members of his immediate family could be killed if they name names. Struggling to be heard over two of her grandchildren playing raucously at her home in the County Down countryside, McKendry said she knew the identities of the people who dragged her mother away. \"If full cooperation into the murder of my mother includes naming those who burst into our flat, who dragged my mother away from us at gunpoint and who were directly involved in her disappearance and murder, then yes, I would be prepared to name names. To me, that is not informing, but doing my duty to my mother,\" she said. \"And, if anything happens to me, I have five children who will carry on campaigning for the truth.\" Asked if she was worried about possible retaliation if she named those involved, she replied: \"Are they going to come and shoot me like they did with my mother all those years ago? I don't think so, not any more. As I said before, I spent the first half of my life in terror of those people, but now that fear is gone. It is they who are afraid these days, of the truth and of justice catching up on them.\" She went further on Newsnight on Thursday evening, saying: \"What are they going to do to me? They've done so much to me already in the past 42 years, will they come and put a bullet in my head? Well, they know where I live.\" McKendry agreed that the Belfast Project-Boston College taped archives of ex-IRA and loyalist paramilitaries had played a key role in prompting the Police Service of Northern Ireland to arrest Adams, the Sinn F\u00e9in president and former West Belfast MP. Alongside her husband, Seamus, McKendry has long insisted that one-time Belfast IRA commander Brendan Hughes was telling the truth when he alleged in a taped archive that Adams gave the order for her mother to be killed and buried secretly to avoid any potential political embarrassment for the republican movement. She said: \"I have always believed Gerry Adams was involved in the murder of my mother and, until the day I die, I will believe that. There's a saying here: 'the dogs in the street know it'.\" Adams has consistently denied his former friend's allegations of involvement in the murder and has also rejected claims that he was ever in the IRA. The Sinn F\u00e9in president, who is the member of parliament for Co Louth in the Irish Republic, has said that Hughes's allegations stemmed from his opposition to the party's peace strategy. Last month, when another of Gerry Adams' estranged former comrades, the IRA negotiator Ivor Bell, was charged with aiding and abetting her mother's murder, McKendry predicted outside Belfast's Laganside courthouse that the Sinn F\u00e9in president would be the next person arrested. Bell, a veteran republican who held secret talks with British ministers and senior civil servants earlier in 1972, denies all the charges against him. But McKendry insists that she is ready to take on Adams. \"I have waited a long time for [Adams] to be questioned by the police about my mother's murder. Seamus and I fought a long, often very lonely campaign to bring my mother's story back into public view \u2026 and to hopefully one day get justice,\" she said. Adams' arrest brings to seven the number of people questioned so far over what happened to Jean McConville in 1972 \u2013 the bloodiest year of the Northern Irish Troubles. But if the Boston College archive and the testimonies do not stand up in court as evidence, and if police do not prosecute Adams, McKendry said she would be prepared to take civil legal action. Citing the precedent of the Omagh bomb families who took a similar path against the Real IRA, she said she regarded what happened as a heinous act. \"From the start I have been serious about taking a civil legal action against Gerry Adams if there is no criminal prosecution. The Omagh bomb families took one against the Real IRA over what happened to their loved ones \u2013 they led the way. If we have to go down that route, we will be seeking support to bring a civil action against him.\" \"If Gerry Adams, Sinn F\u00e9in and the IRA say it was war, then disappearing a civilian \u2026 shooting them is a was a war crime,\" she said. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 May 2014. An earlier version said Helen McKendry had seen her mother being dragged away by the IRA. Although her brothers and sisters were present, she was not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
