On the losing side with Aston Villa in the League Cup against Manchester United in 2010, Milner sat out City's FA Cup win against Stoke the following season, then got on to the pitch for the last half-hour against Wigan last year, only to find himself on the wrong end of one of the great Wembley upsets. Sunday brings Sunderland and, on paper at least, a chance to bulk up the medal collection, though after the Wigan experience Milner has every reason to be wary of the underdog, especially as City were beaten 1-0 on Wearside not just this season but in each of their last four visits. \"I don't really believe in bogey teams. The results might just be a coincidence but we need to make sure the same thing doesn't happen at Wembley,\" he says. \"We are disappointed with our record against them but there is no better place to put things right.\" What still irks Milner about last year's FA Cup final is that City themselves were a let-down, disappointing some 60,000 supporters who made the trip. \"We didn't play anywhere near the level that we had set for ourselves but you cannot take anything away from Wigan,\" he says. \"They played very well and we got it wrong tactically. We didn't perform. \"You have to hold up your hands and say Wigan deserved it but it still hurts because chances of winning a medal don't come around too often. That's why it is silly to think of the League Cup as a lesser competition. You are in a Wembley final, you are desperate to win. Anyone would love to have the medal and a major trophy on their CV. When you reach Wembley you think of the amount of hours you have put in training throughout your life, all the games you have played up to that point and, if you win a trophy, it is there forever as a reward. \"Losing a cup final is massively disappointing but you can accept it if you play to your potential. I still ask myself how we managed to lose at Aston Villa in the league this year, we dominated the game and ended up being beaten 3-2, but sometimes you can play well and the result doesn't go for you. The FA Cup final was different. We just didn't turn up.\" It is widely imagined that uncertainty over Roberto Mancini's immediate future had something to do with that, though Milner is not the type to seek excuses. \"At a club like City there are things in the papers and talk all the time,\" he says. \"Ever since I've been a footballer I have coped with that. Think of the things that used to go on at Leeds, for instance. You get used to things being said in the press, stories coming out, reports that are untrue, that's football. We are professional players and we don't let talk affect our preparations. It is a sign of a strong dressing room that you stay focused on events on the field. You can't really control what happens off it.\" Though still only 28 Milner seems to have been around for ages, due to breaking into the Leeds team at the same time as his contemporary Wayne Rooney was emerging at Everton. City is his fourth Premier League club, after spells at Newcastle and Villa, and while he plays often enough to remain in Roy Hodgson's World Cup plans the wealth of talent at Manuel Pellegrini's disposal means he cannot consider himself a regular. Few actually can at the Etihad, apart from the captain, the goalkeeper and Sergio Ag\u00fcero. \"I want to play every game but I know that is not possible at City,\" he says. \"The big question you have to answer for yourself is whether you are better playing every week at a lesser club or not playing quite as many games as you would like at City but contesting four trophies, taking part in Champions League nights and challenging for the title every year. \"I honestly don't know what the right answer is but I feel valued at City and I love being at the club and working with the players we have. Every day is a learning process, the list of big names in the squad is endless and it is great to be around them.\" Nothing if not dedicated, Milner has even taken lessons in Spanish in order to improve his communication with team-mates. \"I'm getting there,\" he explains. \"Zaba [Pablo Zabaleta] and David [Silva] actually speak very good English now but some of the newer Spanish players know they can come to me because I speak a bit of the language and it helps. It is not always easy for foreign players to adapt, the Premier League is very different from any other league in the world. There might be days in training when it's cold and windy but they see us running around and getting stuck in and, though they may be tired, it lifts them. \"That's why, although the impact of the foreign players at the club has been outstanding, you need a nucleus of players who know the Premier League, people who know what to expect when it is snowing or when you are away at Hull City in January. The league is a 38-game slog and you need the likes of Joleon Lescott and Micah Richards who are massive influences in the dressing room. \"Games at Wembley are an added bonus. One of my greatest memories is the day we beat United in the FA Cup semi at Wembley with half the ground doing the Poznan. The whole stadium was shaking, the memory will stick with me forever, and hopefully it was the same for the fans too. We know it is not cheap to attend these games, so giving the fans a good day out is definitely at the forefront of our minds.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
