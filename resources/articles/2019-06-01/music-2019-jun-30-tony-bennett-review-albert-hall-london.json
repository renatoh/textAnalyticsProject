He surely doesn\u2019t do it for the money \u2013 the New York native won back the fortune he squandered in the 70s via a career renaissance that began almost 30 years ago, and never really abated. He remains a busy recording artist, following 2014\u2019s Lady Gaga collaboration Cheek to Cheek and high-profile duets with Norah Jones, Aretha and Amy Winehouse with last year\u2019s chart-topping revisit of the Great American Songbook in the company of contemporary jazz star Diana Krall, Love Is Here to Stay. Tonight, his Tony Bennett Quartet keep things spry, their swing never less than mellifluous, but with a restless bustle and combustive solos that prevent the hall ever feeling like the world\u2019s roomiest elevator. They also back the opening singer, Donna Byrne, who\u2019s at best a cruise-ship crooner, her voice a maudlin blancmange, wobbling in all the right places but never making the songs hers. By contrast, Bennett\u2019s voice, once so smooth, has weathered over recent years, growing raspy, yellowing like old newspaper, and not always able to hit every note of his melodies. But while this mars a sprightly I\u2019ve Got Rhythm, this aged quality, this vulnerability \u2013 Bennett\u2019s very 92-ness \u2013 lend new poignancy to these songs. The setlist seems hand-picked for wry references to age \u2013 Bennett laughs gently after singing \u201cAs I approach the prime of my life,\u201d in This Is All I Ask, and requesting: \u201cBeautiful girls, walk a little slower when you walk by me.\u201d But he\u2019s not only poking fun at his advanced years; there\u2019s a sadness, too, the weight of the years passing, so his voice breaks as he sings \u201cI will stay younger than spring\u201d, with a yearning for this to be true. Weaved among his more upbeat standards, these darker, more impassioned moments are perhaps unexpectedly resonant; Duke Ellington\u2019s (In My) Solitude is brittle and moving, Bennett taunted \u201cby memories that never die\u201d, while James Ingram\u2019s How Do You Keep the Music Playing? takes on a new meaning as he sings \u201cHow do you keep the song from fading?\u201d, clearly reluctant to relinquish the stage that he loves. Deftly escorted there by his quartet, he reaches closing crescendos of torch song emotion that are almost operatic, and anything but easy listening. He closes with Fly Me to the Moon, and if the subtlety of his voice is gone, the power remains. And while pretenders-to-the-throne like Bubl\u00e9 might deliver such songs with a polish now beyond Bennett\u2019s reach, they can\u2019t sing them as if they\u2019ve lived every word of them, every last disappointment and fleeting spark of love, the way Tony does tonight. That he can do it at all, at his age, is remarkable enough; that his cheating of the final curtain is so moving and ultimately joyous tonight makes Bennett treasurable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
