Only when cheating is classified as criminal fraud \u2013 obtaining money by deception, which it surely is \u2013 will sport stem the modern tide of swindling. This may yet be the fate of the Renault conspirators, whose stunt in the Singapore Grand Prix determined not only the outcome of that pantomime but arguably the 2008 drivers' championship as well. Taken to its extreme, my solution would lead to bobbies running on the pitch to arrest members of the Tom Daley school of Premier League diving. Simulation wins games and makes money. But you don't need a barrister's wig to see that pre-planned roguery away from the field of play belongs in a separate category to spontaneous chiselling that falls under the jurisdiction of the referee. Ben Johnson's steroid abuse was planned. Nelson Piquet Jr's lunatic crash was planned. Systematic doping in the Tour de France was planned (which is why French police got their handcuffs out). The Harlequins fake blood farrago was planned. State\u2011sponsored doping programmes in East Germany and beyond were planned. Their goal was international prestige, and they ruined and even ended lives, which is why the Piquet prang falls short of the \"worst act of cheating in the history of sport\". What a good title, though. How it cries out to be bestowed. A life in sport is a journey away from innocence. It kills the youthful assumption that games are a refuge from injustice. However craven the world, the rule of law would prevail. Fairness, so elusive in society, was the real prize in the great triviality. It was not just British Corinthianism that propagated this myth. Americans are still hooked on an ideal of purity. The most infamous act of cheating in the whole American canon \u2013 the throwing of the 1919 World Series by the Chicago White Sox, as part of a betting scam \u2013 was reframed as a redemptive tale. \"Say it ain't so, Joe,\" is the eternal reassertion of virtue over venality. Skulduggery is not distinguishable from sport. It is built into the organism, and always was, from the first Olympiads, when cheating was an art form. When Renault's Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds convened to fix the Singapore race via a crash which gave them control of the pit-stop strategies of an entire F1 field, we saw men playing anti-gods, choreographers of gain, in the style of Hansie Cronje. But here's a question: how many modern sports have expired because spectators stomped away out of sheer moral disgust? Answer: none. Every road cycling fan I have ever spoken to compartmentalises that which appals him when a drugs bust takes place away from the spectacle that lights up summer evenings when the Tour de France is whizzing across our screens. Chemical assaults on the body in track and field and cycling are more dangerous to more people than Piquet's smash. They build self-harm into the system; they render top-level success impossible without massive pharmaceutical risk. Here, too, we see a kind of parallel engagement in the audience. People say they are \"not surprised\" by this or that scandal. Matt Le Tissier confesses, in his autobiography, to trying to land a spread betting coup by kicking the ball out early in a game, and football's masses smile and say: \"Bet that happens all the time.\" My theory is that the modern disengagement from remote, superstar athletes makes us not care about them, as humans, and often not trust them, either. They are \"entertainers\" on an ever-rolling screen of digestible \"moments\". Deep down there is still a craving for sport to be character-revealing, life-enhancing, noble. Somehow, a faithless crowd are able to keep pushing through the turnstiles even when they discover that the race they enjoyed from Singapore was just a filthy lie. As if to prove F1's immunity to shame, to self-reflection, a press release dropped the day after Briatore's resignation announcing a new partnership between Brawn GP and Canon for round 14 of this year's championship in, you guessed it, Singapore. Every day is a rewrite, every violation of the so-called spirit of sport a jumping-off point for someone to say it's \"time to move on\" and \"draw a line\", thus exploiting the boredom factor of a super-fast news agenda. It is frightening, really. But then, if people will surrender to public service cuts that stem from a culture of bailing out banks \u2013 and allowing big bonuses to creep back up \u2013 they are hardly likely to take to the streets in protest at the protagonists nicking a living from sport. The race-fixer's best friend is our acquiescence. Ashes glory still shines in the darkness Six-nil will probably end up as seven today when England try to avoid becoming completely banjoed in the one-day series. Andrew Strauss looks mortified, his team are imploding and Australia claim to have reconquered the psychological ground they lost in the Ashes. But have they? It's universally popular to say England have tossed away their Ashes victory by capitulating in the 50-over game. And it does make you question the value of sobriety. This time England eschewed the all-night bender in favour of modesty and self-denial. A fat lot of good it did them. Even without the hangover, Strauss's men walked to the slaughter. Then again, to deposit summer's memory on a dump and submit to Australia's need to feel they are back on top is needlessly self-lacerating. The Ashes triumph still exists. So does the recollection of Strauss's brilliant leadership at The Oval. England have been lousy at 50-over cricket for as long as anyone can remember. They appear incapable of taking it seriously. The format may disappear before they have a chance to master it. Ridicule is appropriate, given their lamentable displays in this NatWest pain marathon, but the greater glory of a second Ashes win in three series still stands. The Test team lost 5-0 in Australia the time before last, so a zero is no automatic ticket to oblivion. Five reasons to savour today's Manchester derby 1 We all know history dawned with the invention of the Premier League, but back in the 1980s, post-industrial Manchester was searching for a future. Milan may be the global HQ for the club game \u2013 with AC and Inter still imperious \u2013 but United's record of 11 Premier League titles and City's \u00a3200m splurge on players could yet knock Italy's fashionistas off their plinth. 2 Creativity. Both sides attack and entertain. Neither club is remotely arriviste. Each has a strong spiritual identity and believes in cultivating youth. 3 City's management core is ex-United. Mark Hughes, the manager, and Brian Kidd, the new head of technical development, were mainstays of Sir Alex Ferguson's first trophy-winning phase. Throw in Carlos Tevez and you have a proper talent raid, proper edge. 4 Ferguson loves a demon. First it was Liverpool, then Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, then Roman Abramovich's Chelsea. Now he turns his fire on \"a small club with a small mentality\" who are \"cocky\" and have had a \"softish start\". This new incitement could delay retirement for a few more years. 5 Emmanuel Adebayor has been the axis of City's forward play. Today we learn whether they can prosper without him. Cause of the week Sir Bobby Robson's memorial service at Durham Cathedral tomorrow will bring the greats together to say goodbye not just to a great football man but an age in the English game. A melodramatic temptation is to say that the values he embodied have been under attack for so long that his passing marks the death of something deeper. But Robson would have scoffed at that. For him football was inviolable. It could not be hijacked by mercenary players or hooligan chairmen. His love for the game survived many attacks and setbacks. Never let go: that was his cause."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
