Jeremy Corbyn has told his fractious shadow cabinet \u201cthe debate is over\u201d on Brexit, as he seeks to stamp his authority on the general election campaign and shift the focus to social justice and the climate emergency. He told the Guardian he has told his frontbenchers to fall into line after divisions over Brexit sparked a furious row over an election. \u201cI just said, \u2018look, this debate is now over. We\u2019ve done it, the party has now made its decision, and that\u2019s it; and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to campaign on\u2019,\u201d he said. Corbyn said he had made a unilateral decision to back Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for the 12 December vote, despite the vocal objections of several colleagues, including Labour\u2019s chief whip, Nick Brown. \u201cI put it to them quite clearly: I said, our objections are now gone. We are now supporting a general election \u2013 and everybody gulped. I didn\u2019t alert anybody in advance \u2013 it was my decision. On my own. I made that decision. And they gulped, and said \u2018Yes Jeremy\u2019.\u201d If elected, Labour plans to negotiate a new deal with Brussels \u2013 including a closer trading relationship \u2013 within three months, and put it to the public in a referendum within six. Meanwhile the People\u2019s Vote campaign will unleash its \u00a31m election war chest this week despite a continuing internal feud, in part about whether it should back more Labour candidates. Despite half of its staff still being on strike, the campaign says it has received \u00a3200,000 in donations in the past two days. Overnight, President Trump waded in to British politics, saying he hoped Boris Johnson and Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, would come together on a united political platform. But Farage said on Sunday he would not run for a seat in the general election and the PM has rejected the suggestion from both that he should work with the Brexit party. * * * Grace Millane \u2013 The man accused of killing the British backpacker in New Zealand nearly a year ago has re-entered his not-guilty plea at the start of his trial. The name of the 27-year-old New Zealand man has been suppressed by the court. The judge said members of the 12-person jury had a duty to \u201cput feelings of sympathy and prejudice to one side and approach their task coolly and dispassionately\u201d. Millane, 21, disappeared from central Auckland on 1 December and her body was found in bushland in west Auckland a week later. The death shocked New Zealand and prompted an outpouring of public grief. * * * \u2018Time to move on\u2019 \u2013 The British-born CEO of McDonald\u2019s, Steve Easterbrook, has left the company after violating company policy by engaging in a consensual relationship with an employee. The company said he had demonstrated poor judgement as managers are forbidden from having romantic relationships with direct or indirect employees. In an email to staff, Easterbrook acknowledged the relationship and said it was a mistake: \u201cGiven the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on.\u201d * * * Bowel cancer \u2013 The presence of certain bacteria may increase risk of the disease, a new study has suggested. The research looked at the genetic and gut microbiome data of about 4,000 people and whether there were genetic variants linked to the presence of certain types of bacteria. The results showed those whose genes increased the likelihood of having a type of Bacteroidales bacteria had a 2-15% increased risk of the disease. The team said the findings backed up previous research suggesting bacteria are more common in those with bowel cancer. * * * \u2018Begging fines\u2019 \u2013 A landmark high court case will consider whether fines for begging, loitering and leaving bedding in doorways unfairly targets homeless people, after the fundraising campaign for legal costs reached its target. Lawyers for Sarah Ward, who lives in Poole, will challenge a public space protection order in the town centre which prohibits obstructing doorways, sitting with a receptacle \u201cfor the purpose of begging\u201d and other behaviour associated with homelessness. People found to have violated the order are liable to a \u00a3100 spot fine, which can rise to \u00a31,000 if left unpaid, and receive a summary conviction. The case, to be heard in 2020, could have implications for a rising number of councils that have obtained the power to issue fines in England and Wales. * * * Better latte than never \u2013 The first compostable one-cup coffee pods from a major manufacturer will go on sale this week in a battle to stop the 20bn pods used every year around the world from ending up in landfill. The Italian espresso giant Lavazza is aiming to replace its entire range of home use capsules with new eco-friendly ones \u2013 at the same retail price \u2013 by the end of the year. It\u2019s thought that 95m cups of coffee are drunk in the UK every day, but the single-serve pods typically end up in landfill where they can take take up to 500 years to break down.

Lunchtime read \u2013 Drugs, violence, rebellion: Flea\u2019s troubled life before the Chili Peppers At 13, the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist had a terrifying experience at Halloween. News spread across his neighbourhood that there was a mad gunman on the loose. The children scattered to find safety but when Flea, real name Michael Peter Balzary, returned home, he realised the gunman was his stepfather. \u201cHe was the lunatic they were all talking about,\u201d Flea recalled. \u201cIt was terrifying and shameful.\u201d But it reflected a violent and sometimes terrifying childhood of drugs and petty crime, triggered in some part by the separation of his parents and his musician stepfather\u2019s dangerous lifestyle. In Flea\u2019s memoir, Acid for the Children, he tells of smoking joints at 12, roaming the streets with no one watching; feeling abandoned by his father. Flea writes that he had \u201can undying sense that something was wrong with me, that everyone else is clued into a group consciousness from which I am excluded\u201d. However dysfunctional his stepfather\u2019s life, it exposed him to music: \u201cWhen I saw him and his musician buddies set up in the living room to play bebop with such emotion and physicality, it changed my life forever,\u201d he said. Ultimately, Flea said, he found everything about writing the book hard. \u201cI went through so much to get it to be honest about what shaped me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is about: a yearning to know who I am.\u201d Sport Lewis Hamilton said 2019 has been his best and toughest season after he secured his sixth world title on Sunday with a second-place finish in the United States Grand Prix.

Business Government spending is on course to return to levels last seen in the 1970s, according to a report that found both Tory and Labour plans will significantly increase the share of GDP taken up by the state over the next parliament. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said spending sprees aimed at ending austerity and increasing public investment were central to the plans of both major parties and would drive spending above the average for the 20 years up to the 2008 financial crash of 37.4% of GDP.
