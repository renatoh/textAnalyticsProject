The Labour leader will say that official NHS statistics prove that the Tories' reorganisation of the health service is directly damaging frontline patient care. At the same time, Labour will argue that the funds set aside to pay for the costs of the health bill's reorganisation would protect all 6,000 nursing jobs if parliament chose in the coming weeks to abandon the reorganisation. The claims could prove to be damaging to the government, under attack from the health profession for its proposed reforms. They come in a difficult week for the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, during which the bill will return to the Lords, where it can expect to come under attack by peers of all political persuasions. Labour is keen to maintain pressure on the Tories after an improved performance by Miliband in which he was widely praised for his attacks on David Cameron over City bonuses. The number of full-time qualified nurses fell from 281,431 in May 2010 to 277,915 in October 2011, a fall of 3,516, according to data from the NHS Information Centre which have been released by Labour. The figure refers to the change in \"qualified nursing, midwifery and health visiting staff\". The Royal College of Nursing has identified 5,000 nursing posts at risk, comprising both qualified nurses and healthcare assistants; Labour believes half these posts are qualified nurses. Miliband will visit staff and patients at the Princess Royal university hospital in Kent on Monday, and is expected to say: \"In tough times and with little money around, the very first priority should be to protect the frontline NHS. \"Instead, we have a government blowing a vast amount of money on a damaging back-office reorganisation at the same time as it is cutting thousands of nurses, with more than 3,000 already gone. Labour's priority is protecting the frontline, not a pointless and damaging reorganisation of the NHS. \"We're calling for the bill to be scrapped, and for some of the money set aside to fund this reorganisation to instead be made available to the NHS to protect the thousands of nursing posts either already cut or set to be cut in the coming years. \"It is a clear and simple choice for the government: by stopping this damaging reorganisation we can fund 6,000 nurses.\" The attack by Miliband comes as Labour launches the next stage of its campaign against the government's health bill. Labour, Liberal Democrat and cross-bench peers are discussing joint strategies to torpedo further elements of the bill when it begins its report stage in the Lords on Wednesday. They are training their sights on the parts of the bill that would open the NHS to a greater role for the private sector. Writing in the Observer, Miliband said: \"It is not too late to stop this bill. \"We have three months to prevent great harm being done to the NHS. Now is the time for people of all parties and of none, the professions, the patients and now peers in the House of Lords to work together to try to stop this bill.\" The worst option, he added, would be for the government to press ahead with the reforms merely to save face. The latest action to amend the bill \u2013 which would devolve commissioning to GPs and open up service to more competition \u2013 comes despite the government offering a string of concessions when it put down 136 amendments. Last year, the government set aside nearly \u00a31.8bn to pay for the costs of the health bill reorganisation that could only be used once it is enacted. Labour is calling for \u00a3750m of the money set aside for the reorganisation to be used instead to fund 6,000 nursing posts over the spending review period, replacing the 3,500 nurses that have already been lost and protecting a further 2,500 posts that research suggests will be lost in the coming years. The list of professional bodies which have come out in opposition to the bill include the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of Midwives, the British Medical Association, the Royal College of GPs, the Royal College of Radiologists, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Health minister Anne Milton said that Labour's accusations were wrong. \"Since the election we've cut admin staff by 15,000 and the total number of clinical staff has remained the same. \"If we were not proceeding with modernisation in NHS by the end of this parliament there would be \u00a31.5bn not available to support services and front line staff.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
