They\u2019re knackered. They worked just as hard as the other side, but they lost. There\u2019s no adrenaline rush to sustain them \u2013 think of the losing side in a tight footy final. And they know that no-one is listening to them. Why not just take a break for a while? After all, nothing will have changed when they come back to work. However, the bitter truth is that just when spirits and energies are at their lowest is the time to think strategically. Here are five things all losing parties should undertake. 1. Work out why you lost On election night there were two main theories. Labor politicians talked elliptically about \"disunity\" \u2013 the fact that Kevin Rudd tore down Julia Gillard and the ALP brand. Coalition supporters used Abbott\u2019s talking points \u2013 trust, competence and the carbon tax. Neither of these is a full answer. But they are a sign of what is to come. Individuals will choose the explanation for defeat that most suits them and stick to it consistently, no matter what the evidence. Oh, and no-one will bother to gather evidence. The biggest favour anyone can do for the ALP is to conduct a proper post-mortem \u2013 by which I do not mean the formal party process. What is needed is the kind of polling that Lord Ashcroft did for the British Conservatives, which identified the policies and aspects of the brand that were toxic. An immense amount was spent on polling during this failed election campaign; now is the time to send a fraction of that on finding out in granular detail what went wrong. 2. When you are on the right side of history, stay there After the 1996 Howard victory, Labor spent years running away from the Hawke/Keating record only to discover that if you abandon a Labor government holus-bolus then you lose the good with the bad. Thus Howard claimed the economic well-being that was the consequence of hard won Labour reforms. Leadership contenders Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten have both made it clear that the ALP will not shy from action to tackle climate change \u2013 and nor should it. When you are on the right side of history, you should stick there. But as important as what you defend is what you discard. Is there a better economic rule than return to surplus? Is a consensual approach to health reform wrong? What, in the end, are the policies or positions which are abandoned and symbolise the fact that Labor \"gets it\"? 3. Unity must be earned, not imposed The big question is what Labor stands for in the future. To answer that requires a vigorous contest of ideas. And the best way to ensure that is a full-blown leadership contest that runs long enough for the whole of the movement \u2013 political and industrial, members and supporters, federal and state parliamentarians \u2013 to have their say. The worst thing possible now would be a coronation. Australia needs to understand the values of Labor\u2019s next leader. What drives them? What will they do? Will they understand voters' concerns? Unity must be earned not imposed, otherwise it is the unity of the graveyard. So, a proper 15 round heavyweight bout is what Labor needs \u2013 with manifestos, headland speeches, town-hall meetings, street-corner meetings and debates. Let all the possible leaders lug it out. Labor is blessed with a number of potential contenders \u2013 show them off. 4. Frame it right As Tony Blair used to say, when you are in government you get up and the most important question of the day is what are you going to do; when you are in opposition the most important question is what you are going to say. And, in the early days, the fundamental challenge is to get the framing of the government right. The right critique will inform the arc of your narrative from now until the next election. Is it going to be \"broken promises\", \"just not up to it\" or \"wrong priorities\"? The right frame will be grounded in a sober analysis of the defeat, and the values and purpose articulated by the successful leadership candidate. A good speech now, setting out how the opposition will hold the government to account, will pay off in a year\u2019s time \u2013 if it is right. 5. If no-one is listening to you, now is the time to listen to them The leader and the shadow cabinet should embark on a \"Big Conversation\" with Australia. Think-tanks, peak bodies, NGOs, academics \u2013 they all have ideas, big and small, mad and bad, insightful and inspirational. Go and talk to them, but remember that conversation is not just waiting for your turn to speak. We say that naughty children need a good talking to. Well, Labor needs to understand that Australia needs a good \"listening to\". Opposition isn\u2019t easy or comfortable. Nor should it be. The aim is to spend as little time there as possible. There may well be another election within 18 months if Abbott is stymied in the Senate and calls a double dissolution. Every minute of every day needs to be used productively. My five point plan sets out the first steps in a journey of a thousand miles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
