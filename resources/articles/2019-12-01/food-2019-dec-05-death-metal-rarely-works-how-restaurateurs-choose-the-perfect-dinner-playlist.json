Probably not.\u201d As a former A&amp;R man for EMI (he signed Coldplay \u2013 \u201cThey were a different band then,\u201d he says apologetically), Keeling can\u2019t help but notice what is playing on the stereo when he is eating out \u2013 especially when it\u2019s wrong. He can immediately recall examples at both ends of the fine dining spectrum: the Eat Tokyo chain plays \u201cthe most melancholic, weird, ceremonial synthesiser music \u2013 I often go in for a quick bit of lunch and come out feeling quite depressed.\u201d Meanwhile, diners at Asador Etxebarri in the Basque country \u2013 voted the third-best restaurant in the world earlier this year \u2013 may enjoy \u201ca version of the British national anthem that sounded like it was played by a kid on the recorder,\u201d says Keeling incredulously. \u201cIt was on a loop as well.\u201d At a time when streaming services suggest playlists by setting and mood, and music supervisors for film and TV are looked to for indications of the next big hit, there has never been greater awareness of the power of music to enhance a scene. Yet it is equally as capable of detracting from one \u2013 and this is often most evident when dining out. Keeling\u2019s cautionary tales speak volumes about the perils of playing DJ to a varied, indifferent audience principally concerned with their other senses. Accordingly, in Noble Rot, no music plays at all (although there is a turntable for vinyl in the wine bar). \u201cWhen I listen to music, I try to pay attention to it,\u201d says Keeling. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with food and wine \u2013 it\u2019s about giving everything its due space and respect.\u201d But not playing music also gets around the crucial question of what to play. Keeling notes that diners at Noble Rot, a 55-cover restaurant, are diverse, ranging in age from their early 20s to 80-plus. \u201cWhat are we going to play that everybody will feel enhances their experience? Music is as strong a flavour as food \u2013 it\u2019s just another thing to get wrong.\u201d Over the past 15 years or so, an entire industry has emerged to help companies reflect \u2013 or even construct \u2013 their brand identity. \u201cThe earlier we get in there, the better,\u201d says Mikey Vettraino of MAV Music Supervision. Vettraino founded the music consultancy in 2004 after overseeing the introduction of music to the members\u2019 club Soho House, where he was then operations manager. Since then, the company has assembled a global portfolio of more than 500 clients, including Wagamama, the O2 Arena and Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Lucky Cat in Mayfair. Vettraino says the music consultant serves as \u201cblind DJ\u201d: \u201cYou\u2019re playlisting a song that\u2019s going to come on, and you don\u2019t know what the atmosphere is.\u201d The company\u2019s approach is to come up with a few playlists to suit different times of the day, each sonically cohesive enough to be put on shuffle (and about four or five times the length that it will play for, to avoid too much repetition \u2013 for the staff\u2019s sake). Song choice is informed by a back-and-forth with the client of representative songs, soundtrack snippets and moodboards. (Genres are considered to be essentially meaningless.) For example, Wagamama\u2019s brief was to appeal to a twentysomething, urban woman, interpreted by MAV\u2019s head of music and operations Alex Hill as Annie Mac-esque \u2013 \u201cthe very accessible side of alternative pop\u201d. Hill says there are some artists \u2013 such as Khruangbin, Nightmares on Wax and Bonobo \u2013 that suit most settings: (and has made such a playlist of them for the Guardian here). \u201cDeath metal, or minimal techno, isn\u2019t going to work 99 times out of 100.\u201d There are also technical considerations, such as whether a song has been overplayed or whether an explicit song has a clean version, as well as disruptive outros and intros, guitar solos and spoken-word breaks to navigate. Most crucial for the service industries are the peaks and troughs throughout the day, week or seasons (MAV typically updates clients\u2019 playlists quarterly). After the lunch rush at Wagamama, for example, the soundtrack becomes softer and more atmospheric to take the edge off the experience of dining in a fairly empty restaurant. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your banging-est playlist on when the restaurant\u2019s empty and there\u2019s one guy sat there,\u201d says Hill. Conversely, Wagamama\u2019s new \u201cgrab and go\u201d lunch spot Mamago requested high-energy, fast-paced music to encourage turnover. (Hotels are known to do the same to encourage guests not to linger at the buffet.) Music\u2019s influence on staff productivity and customer spend was established by research dating back to the early 80s. When the soundtrack and dining experience are in harmony, it can become a key part of an establishment\u2019s reputation. Vettraino says that MAV\u2019s playlists have cropped up in several restaurant reviews. Diners\u2019 requests to know the name of the song playing can suggest a burgeoning credibility with music lovers. Part of the appeal of Shoreditch street food market Dinerama (where MAV playlists have replaced live DJs) is the chance of hearing an obscure song or remix you like enough to look up on Shazam, says Hill. That may be best left to the experts. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Spotify playlists called, like, \u2018Your Morning Cafe\u2019, and they do a job \u2013 but they\u2019re not tailored.\u201d The desire to appeal to all tastes has led to some genres, artists and even songs emerging as staples for hospitality playlists \u2013 Radio 1 Live Lounge-style acoustic covers of Top 40 pop being one example. Earlier this year, Hillary Dixler Canavan, the restaurant editor for the US website Eater, shared her take on \u201cevery generically cool restaurant\u2019s playlist\u201d with a Spotify playlist, featuring LCD Soundsystem, Phoenix, TV on the Radio, M83, Vampire Weekend and classic hip-hop such as Talib Kweli and Notorious BIG. But in later unpicking why these songs seemed ubiquitous in the kind of establishments that served natural wine and cauliflower steak, Canavan noted that a defined audience was being targeted: millennial and Gen X diners in urban centres, with disposable income and skewing white. \u201cThat the musical taste of this cohort has become at all universalised is telling \u2013 and, sadly, not that surprising,\u201d she concluded. That said: \u201cYour parents would probably find it a bit too loud.\u201d It is a reminder that one way that music can influence people in a space is by shutting some out of it. For many dining establishments, the street cred to be gained from a distinctive playlist isn\u2019t worth the risk of putting off some customers. For others, that is the goal. Black Axe Mangal in north London is as often referenced for its blaring soundtrack of metal and grunge \u2013 Metallica, Queens of the Stone Age, Black Sabbath, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce \u2013 as it is for its kebabs. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in making it innocuous? You may as well not play it,\u201d says its founder, Lee Tiernan, bluntly. The thinking behind the polarising playlist is the same as the genitalia graffitied on the floor, he says \u2013 \u201cI just know the people I want to attract. I think Jay Rayner said it best in that it\u2019s not for everyone, but if you\u2019re into it, you\u2019re really into it.\u201d In that sense, the music at Black Axe Mangal is as much a part of it as the food, says Tiernan \u2013 although, these days, hard rock has given way to more UK grime and US rappers such as Action Bronson, Tyler, the Creator and Frank Ocean. \u201cYou can almost guarantee it\u2019s going to be loud.\u201d This article was amended on 6 December 2019.
