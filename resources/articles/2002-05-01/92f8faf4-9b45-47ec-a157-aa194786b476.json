But if you really want to get away from the Brit hordes then head for the bottom of the Mani peninsula on the mainland and the village of Gerolimenas. We went there last year with Filoxenia, a Greek specialist holiday company, and it was great - a tiny, friendly, pebble-beach village. They send only a handful of people each year. Lesley Carter Alix Sharkey went to Malaysia and fulfilled all the criteria that define their perfect (ie gullible) tourist: didn't stay too long, spent his time in \"luxury\" hotels, looked only at what was pointed out to him and believed all the propaganda. How else could he have concluded that Malaysia is \"as PC as it gets\"? Jill M Matthew Sorry to be a party pooper, but, I'd like to take issue with David Munk's article on the Maldives (April 20). If you and your food are going to be jetted in from thousands of miles away to let you have a jolly nice little holiday in the middle of nowhere, then no amount of solar panels and recycling of batteries will compensate for your negative environmental impact, in particular on CO2 emissions. Greenwash gets the world nowhere. Take a look at the section titled \"Flying off to a warmer climate\" on chooseclimate.org to see what the CO2 impact of your flight will be. Rebecca Lawson The Get your kit out column last week featured an expensive, heavy neck pillow which is meant to help you get to sleep on planes by stopping your head lolling to one side. I find that the cheap blow-up ones you buy at airports do the trick and take no room. Andy Fountain A lot of the holidays you feature are just too expensive. Last week, for instance, in your Best offers column, there was a \u00a36,499 weekend to watch the Monaco Grand Prix. Come off it.
