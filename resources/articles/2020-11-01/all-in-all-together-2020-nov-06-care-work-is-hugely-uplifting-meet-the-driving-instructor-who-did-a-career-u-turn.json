But in the weeks leading up to the lockdown announcement, she had noticed a steady surge in cancellations. \u201cQuite a few people weren\u2019t comfortable having lessons because they were worried about the virus and because everyone\u2019s financial priorities had shifted,\u201d she says. \u201cThen the 2-metre distancing rule was implemented and I knew that wasn\u2019t possible in a car. It wasn\u2019t essential work, either.\u201d Realising her income had shrunk to virtually nothing overnight, Camilla took action and began searching for other opportunities. \u201cInitially I looked into supermarket work and delivery driver jobs, but then I realised that I\u2019d always wanted to provide home care for people. It\u2019s really important as it enables people to live in their own homes independently.\u201d One company Camilla came across in Worcester stuck out \u2013 a family-run organisation providing home care to the elderly and vulnerable. \u201cTheir website explained they offered extensive training and support, so I filled in an application.\u201d The next day, Camilla was contacted by the team and before long she\u2019d landed a care-assistant role, working full-time. Covering towns across Worcestershire, Camilla\u2019s job involves visiting elderly people to help with various tasks \u2013 anything from food shopping to cooking, cleaning and personal care. \u201cSome need help with medication, others with things like opening the curtains, making beds or washing up,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have an app where we put all our notes, so before each shift I\u2019ll read up to ensure we give the right level of care. It\u2019s important that the people we support are able to keep their independence and we don\u2019t take over. We know what each person is capable of doing and wants (or doesn\u2019t want) to do.\u201d Despite her training and time spent shadowing colleagues, the role proved challenging initially. \u201cI\u2019d never done anything like it, so I didn\u2019t know whether I\u2019d be able to. I get quite anxious with new things and was trying to calm myself down, saying: \u2018You can do this!\u2019 \u201cIt was hard for the people we support as well because the care workers wear masks and most of us have brown hair, which makes it hard for them to work out who we are. But after a couple of weeks, they recognise us, and you soon get the hang of things.\u201d Camilla was pleased to discover that many of her existing skills were transferable. \u201cBeing a driving instructor means you meet new people all the time and you\u2019re making conversation, making sure they feel comfortable, happy and confident, which is exactly what we do in this role, too.\u201d The opportunity was a lifeline, she says. \u201cThe care work saved me financially over lockdown.\u201d It has also proved rewarding. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely uplifting because the people we support are so happy they can stay in their home environments and get that extra help. It\u2019s uplifting for their families, too, because they\u2019d been trying to do it all themselves. \u201cIf I\u2019m on the evening shift, making sure people are comfortable and getting ready for sleep, I think: \u2018I\u2019ve helped them achieve that.\u2019 Together, we\u2019ve reached their goal of going to bed, safe in their own homes.\u201d Having now resumed giving driving lessons, Camilla works part-time in each role \u2013 a combination she enjoys. \u201cAfter being in the car for a couple of hours, you get a bit like: \u2018Get me out of here!\u2019 It\u2019s good to have a change. \u201cDriving can get lonely, so it\u2019s been particularly nice being able to build relationships with those I support and with other care workers \u2013 everybody is lovely. I\u2019m grateful to have had the chance to try something new.\u201d What would she say to anyone considering taking a similar leap? \u201cIf it\u2019s something you\u2019re passionate about, try it and see \u2013 just give yourself that chance.\u201d This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.
