Fifa said that because it was conducting its own inquiry into the claims there was no need for Blatter, who next week hopes to be re-elected as president for another four-year term, to take up the invitation to appear before the committee. Several committee members have been forthright about the need for fundamental reform in the wake of allegations made before it by Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, that four members of the Fifa executive committee asked for bribes or inducements during the 2018 World Cup bidding campaign. In evidence from a Sunday Times whistleblower submitted under parliamentary privilege, the committee also heard that two executive committee members had been accused of taking a bribe of $1.5m (\u00a3926,000) from the Qatari bid for the 2022 World Cup. The Qatar FA and the four executive committee members have strongly denied the claims. \"Fifa has immediately asked both the Football Association and the Sunday Times for a report on this matter,\" said a spokesman. \"With this in mind, Fifa has informed the culture, media and sport committee that it is focusing on its own investigation and that there is therefore no need for the Fifa president to attend the committee.\" The FA has promised that its own inquiry into the allegations, conducted by James Dingemans QC, will be delivered by Friday ahead of the Fifa Congress and presidential vote next week. The Sunday Times has said it will arrange for its whistleblower to provide evidence to Fifa, but they are likely to do so via signed affadavit rather than in person. Mohamed Bin Hammam, the head of the Asian Football Confederation who is challenging Blatter for the presidency but looks increasingly likely to fail, has accused the FA of forfeiting its right to effect change and urged it to reconsider its decision to abstain. Bin Hammam said: \"It is always disappointing when someone opts not to engage with the rest, when one of our national associations takes the decision not to try to affect change from the inside.\" \"It was with some surprise that I learned that the Football Association has taken the decision not to back either candidate in the upcoming election. Of course, that is the FA's prerogative and it is a position I respect, even if I don't agree with it. \"The FA, with its status as the oldest association in the world and England's position as the birthplace of the modern game, is one of the most important institutions in world football. As a result, they should be working with Fifa and the rest of the global game to improve and enhance football. By choosing to abstain, the FA is, sadly, forfeiting that right.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
