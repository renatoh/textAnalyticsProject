A visit might help", "bodyText": "\u2022 Despite the change of government, we are still being tough on crime and the causes of crime. But we haven't got the cash we once had. We've got to count the pennies. Last week Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, announced plans to transform youth custody with the aim of getting \"value for the taxpayer\", reducing offending and setting young offenders on the road to a better life. He seemed particularly irked by secure children's homes \u2013 local authority-run centres with the emphasis on education and therapy. \"Some youth custodial places cost \u00a3200,000 \u2013 five times the cost of sending a child to a top public school,\" he said, leaving officials to finger secure children's homes as the culprits. So what does he know of secure children's homes? Not as much as he might. For, according to a departmental reply to Labour's Rob Flello, Grayling has yet to visit one. Indeed, there appear to have been just two ministerial visits to secure children's homes since the current government came to office. Coalition types have seemed keener on popping down to the Medway Secure Training Centre, which has a harsher regime. It has had four visits and won a contract extension for private manager G4S. And ministers have been even happier whizzing in and out of the young offenders' institutes, which are harsher still. Secure children's homes may be pricey, but they do appear to provide the rehabilitative education the government says it is looking for. The justice secretary might go to see one before deciding he can get the same thing on the cheap. \u2022 But then the whole thing seems shambolic. Asked to name which parts of the \"secure youth estate\" have been visited, ministers cite Portland, which hasn't been part of it since 1989. And Lancaster, which probably means Lancaster Farms. It hasn't since 2009. These days bungler Gove sets the tone. \u2022 The gay marriage furore, meanwhile, continues to provoke uncomfortable debate within the church, some of it unbecoming. Alan Wilson, the bishop of Buckingham, who supported the measure, finds the wounds haven't even begun to heal. \"A slightly stormy night,\" writes the bish. \"Someone sends me a lot of extremely tendentious opinion about gay marriage, including that there is a gay conspiracy to sodomise our sons, a gay juggernaut that will destroy the world. A leading member of Anglican Mainstream hits the 'reply all' button and tells the sender: 'This is pearls before swine. Alan Wilson is beyond reach. Give him up to Satan for sifting'.\" Satan takes referrals now? Who knew? \u2022 With each passing day in the Eastleigh byelection campaign, the satirist John O'Farrell learns a bit more about why it is safer to be a footsoldier \u2013 as in his memoir Things Can Only Get Better \u2013 than the frontman Labour candidate. But he's in it for the long haul, and he's thinking about his priorities. Out campaigning with Labour MP Alan Whitehead last week, he was accosted by a potential constituent. \"Love your books, hate your policies,\" commented the voter. \"If they'd said 'I love your policies but hate your books,' I'd have been very hurt,\" admitted O'Farrell afterwards. He'd adapt at Westminster, but for now he is what he is. \u2022 Finally, if we learn one thing from The Audience, the play featuring Helen Mirren as the Queen, it is that Mrs Windsor is a woman of strong opinions. The play depicts her meetings with prime ministers: Thatcher, Major and Churchill. Behind closed doors she speaks her mind. But she's less inclined to do so in public, and so we reach the end of a lengthy process which began when she was asked for her thoughts about the apparent security failures that allowed a convicted serial sex offender to join her on her barge on the Thames during the jubilee celebrations. How could this happen, ma'am, asked former Met detective Gurpal Virdi. He wrote last June and heard nothing. Then, a week ago, a reply. \"While careful note has been taken of your comments, I must tell you that this is not a matter on which Her Majesty would comment,\" it said. Polite, and not a total brush-off. Written in November, but apparently not posted until three months later. Was she mulling it over? Was she secretly mad as hell? Wish she'd tweet.
