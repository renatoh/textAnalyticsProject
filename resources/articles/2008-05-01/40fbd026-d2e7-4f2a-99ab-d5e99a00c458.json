PC Mick Regan, a marathon runner with 23 years' service, said he wanted to buy a row of beers for an army medic who helped him escape as he struggled, bleeding, to his feet. Regan described the assault, after an outdoor screening of the Uefa cup final broke down, as \"unbelievable\" and on a different scale from anything he had ever encountered. The father-of-two, who had just gone back on shift after a family holiday in the US, said: \"I was very frightened indeed. I thought I was going to be really seriously injured.\" The attack on Regan, 47, from Stockport, was filmed in detail by CCTV and police cameras. Twenty-two Rangers supporters have been charged in connection with the wider violence that engulfed the Piccadilly area of Manchester, 11 have been bailed and 12 released with cautions. A further seven, including a fan of the match winners Zenit St Petersburg, were arrested but released without charge. Regan said there was a hardcore minority of troublemakers - but a \"big minority\", numbering several thousand. He described how he went to help another officer, as a group of police retreated down a side street, but was tripped and fell. \"A lad threw a bottle at me from short range and hit my left elbow and the next thing I knew I had been tripped up and was on the floor,\" he said. \"There was a huge crowd of people around giving me a good kicking. They were shouting all sorts of abuse and I knew I was in real trouble. \"I had no baton and no way to defend myself but they were raining blows on my body. Thankfully my armour was protecting me but I was very frightened indeed and while I didn't think it was curtains I did think I was going to be really seriously injured. \"The fact is I am a fit guy and I have run marathons, but I found it difficult to get up because I had been winded with all the blows that had been landed on me. \"I wanted to curl up but I remember saying to myself, 'I have got to get up'. \"Then I saw two lads coming from my right and I thought they were going to cut me off and I'd be in trouble again. But one of them shouted at me: 'I'm British army, I'm a medic,' and he grabbed me by the collar and pulled me up the street.\" The man slipped away after the incident and has not yet been identified. He was English and is thought to be a fan who had come into town to watch the match. Regan, a former territorial army corporal, suffered a puncture wound to the elbow and bruising to his body and arms. Manchester city council is to hold an inquiry into its handling of the day, which saw the local street drinking ban relaxed to avoid what its Labour leader, Sir Richard Leese, called \"a public order problem\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
