A seven-page document arrived at the Dublin offices of solicitors representing Magnier and McManus yesterday and the Irish billionaires were last night considering its contents in their winter retreat in Barbados. United's directors are hoping it will satisfactorily answer the majority of the 99 questions posed by Magnier and McManus through their company Cubic Expression, which owns 25.49% of the club. If the club's response does not satisfy them, the Irishmen will pursue one of three options: calling for an emergency general meeting, demanding a seat on the United board or reporting their concerns to the Financial Services Authority. The central component of Magnier's and McManus's original letter was to highlight areas, such as transfer dealings and corporate governance, where they felt United's conduct fell \"short of best practice\". Yesterday United's chief executive David Gill was appalled to learn that Cubic's lawyers had requested a transcript of Sir Alex Ferguson's press conference last Friday, at which he spoke of his son Jason having his dustbins searched and having brought in the police. Cubic have investigated the possiblilty that some of Ferguson's comments were defamatory. The club are consulting their lawyers before deciding whether to hand over the transcripts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
