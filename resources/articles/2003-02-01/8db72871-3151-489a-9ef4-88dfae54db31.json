The death of Nick Duncombe, the young scrum-half of Harlequins and England, put such chattering into perspective. Duncombe was on a training week in Lanzarote with a Harlequins team-mate when he was taken ill. He died in hospital on Friday afternoon. The latest in a line of talent from RGS High Wycombe, he made his England debut a year ago, when he came on at half-time in England's opening Six Nations match at Murrayfield - a convincing win in which he looked most at home. At the age of 20, having played only one first-class match for Harlequins, he formed the youngest half-back partnership in international history with the 22-year-old Jonny Wilkinson. Making it on to the pitch at all was an achievement, having broken his neck playing for England under-18 21 months earlier - an injury that put him out of the game for a year. Last summer he represented England at sevens in the Commonwealth Games. His death has stunned the sport. A numbed Mark Evans, the director of rugby at Harlequins, said: 'He was simply the best scrum-half of his generation. We are going to miss him terribly.' The tributes were quick to come in from around the English game. 'All of our thoughts are with Nick's family, friends and team-mates,' said Joe Lydon, the coach of the England sevens team. 'He was an outstanding player and one of the most talented and charismatic scrum-halfs I have ever seen or worked with.' Clive Woodward also paid tribute on behalf of the England squad. 'The two caps he gained last year, would have been, I believe, the beginning of a long international career,' said Woodward. 'He was hugely popular with the squad and at Harlequins, and his attitude was outstanding. I'm sure that all supporters and players will share the loss of one of rugby's brightest stars.'
