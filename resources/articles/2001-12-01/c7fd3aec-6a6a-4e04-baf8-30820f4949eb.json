First there's the obligatory hard childhood, with a schizophrenic mother and fried rats for dinner, and then the escape to New York, meeting Charlie Parker and getting fleeced for money to feed the saxist's \"vonce\" habit, then playing with Bird, Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis, arranging for Count Basie and Frank Sinatra, and scoring films. The legendary Nadia Boulanger is quoted as saying that her two most influential pupils were Igor Stravinsky and Quincy Jones. Not much room for gossip at the expense of other musicians: they're all Quincy's best friends. Mind you, even the nice man of music can't help thinking Jacko a little strange. One day it was discovered that Jackson's pet boa constrictor, Muscles, had got into the parrot's cage and swallowed the bird whole. Now the snake couldn't get out again because it had a big bird-shaped lump in it. \"In a way,\" Quincy notes, \"that's a metaphor for Michael's life after Thriller, because at a certain point, he couldn't get back out of the cage.\" Mathematical Mountaintops John L Casti (Oxford, \u00a319.95) Sick of the daily grind? Feel that a life of moneyed luxury is no more than you deserve? All you need is a pencil and paper: just work out the answer to a famous mathematical problem and a million dollars can be yours. Simple. Casti's excellent book organises itself around \"the five most famous problems of all time\". There is Hilbert's Tenth Problem (too algebraic to go into here, sadly), the Four-Colour Problem (are four colours always enough to shade a map so that no two adjoining territories are the same colour?), the Continuum Hypothesis (head-bending stuff about orders of infinity), the Kepler Conjecture (stacking oranges - no, really), and, inevitably, Fermat's Last Theorem (spiced up with current demands for a more general answer). Each section first states the problem with brutal clarity, and then relates how people have got it spectacularly wrong over the years, which is quite reassuring. Reading the Vampire Slayer ed Roz Kaveney (Tauris Parke, \u00a312.99) This \"Unofficial Critical Companion to Buffy and Angel\" sees a variety of contributors gleefully dissecting away by the blue glow of a television and stacks of videocassettes. Buffy and its sister series do a lot of reflexive analysis in the dialogue, and they are so complex and clever as to accommodate easily the inventive readings on display here. One essay cunningly situates the southern Californian locale in a rich nihilist-noir tradition; other contributors spin webs of \"vampire dialectics\", give an eye-opening account of \"slash\" fiction (Buffy stories written by fans), and even offer a scholarly account of Buffy's martial-arts lineage. For late converters, there's also a very handy synopsis of every episode to date. Does what any successful such volume ought to do: makes you want to go and watch Buffy. A lot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
