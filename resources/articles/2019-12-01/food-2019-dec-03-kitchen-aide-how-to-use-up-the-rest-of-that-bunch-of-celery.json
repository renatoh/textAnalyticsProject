But what am I meant to do with the rest of the bunch? Max, Bicester, Oxon Feast\u2019s own Little Miss Perfect, Felicity Cloake, isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call a celery enthusiast. \u201cIt\u2019s vile raw,\u201d she spits. \u201cStringy, and as bitter and minerally as a dishwasher tablet. Ugh!\u201d Cooked, she can live with the stuff, she admits, \u201cbut the only way I\u2019d countenance raw celery is as my mum used to serve it, with a ribbon of Primula down the centre\u201d. But Max asks a sensible question \u2013 what do you do with the rest of the head once you\u2019ve used up a stick or two in a soffritto, stew or cream cheese-smeared treat? \u2013 so we\u2019ll give refuseniks a wide berth from hereon in. Chef Anna Tobias, by contrast, is a celery cheerleader. \u201cIt\u2019s so aromatic,\u201d she swoons, \u201cwith delicate, earthy notes similar to parsley, only more subtle. It\u2019s in the foundations of so many dishes that, if it wasn\u2019t there, you\u2019d miss it.\u201d But, she adds, there\u2019s a big difference between those pale, thin-stalked, plastic-wrapped supermarket bundles and the butch, green behemoths with a forest of leaves that you get at decent markets. The obvious solution to Max\u2019s issue, especially in winter, is soup, says Tobias, who cut her teeth at Blueprint Cafe in its 2000s heyday, before moving on first to the River Cafe and then the head chef gig at Rochelle Canteen; she\u2019s currently looking to open her own place in London next year. \u201cIt\u2019s a cinch, and has very few ingredients. Saute chopped celery and onion in butter, add a bit of cream, blitz, season and it\u2019s job done.\u201d You could also turn your excess into an equally warming braise or gratin, but Tobias turns up the celery gauge even higher and uses it as the main ingredient in a rather out-there stuffing, an idea nicked off her mum, a fellow fan girl: \u201cSweat lots of chopped celery with a couple of onions in a fair bit of butter, then add loads of lemon zest and some juice, and stir in the chopped celery leaves and just enough breadcrumbs to hold everything together.\u201d It goes remarkably well with chicken and turkey, she says, so that\u2019s maybe one to bookmark for the Christmas bird. \u201cThe Chinese use celery a lot, too,\u201d says Tobias, now warming to her task, \u201cespecially in stir-fries, it can really take a sharp, high heat. Try it with lamb and lots of ginger \u2013 that\u2019s yummy. Or go Italian, and fry it in oil with chopped garlic and chilli, then stir in some cooked pulses \u2013 a tin of chickpeas is great with that.\u201d Tobias is in good company with her celery crush. Joyce Molyneux, in her The Carved Angel Cookery Book, swears by roasting it with pheasant and port, saying this \u201ctime-honoured combination outlives the fleeting fashions of the food world\u201d, a sentiment from the 90s we could all do with getting behind now. And Jane Grigson, in her iconic Vegetable Book, goes so far as to give it shared top billing with aubergine in southern Italy\u2019s favourite melanzane antipasto, caponata, and who are we to argue with the the likes of her? That said, Grigson\u2019s celery sauce to go with boiled turkey in English Food is maybe pushing it a bit far, seeing as that features an entire head, chopped, boiled for 20 minutes, then drained, sauteed in butter and mixed with 500ml bechamel before being pureed. As for Dorothy Hartley\u2019s jugged celery in her 1954 book Food In England \u2013 in which the stalks are stuffed in a jar of apple puree with bacon \u2013 something tells me that\u2019s probably even more of an acquired taste. *waves at Felicity* \u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma?
