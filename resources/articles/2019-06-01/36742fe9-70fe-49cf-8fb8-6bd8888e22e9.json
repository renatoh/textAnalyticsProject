Amy Jones did the double, taking player of the match and series awards after she top-scored with 80, while Heather Knight hammered an unbeaten 19-ball 40 as they made 258 for four. \u201cWe\u2019re really pleased to have won 3-0 and to have been ruthless throughout the series,\u201d Knight said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we set our own standards and maintain them regardless of who we\u2019re playing. We\u2019ve done a lot of things very well across these games. It\u2019s 13 wins in a row now, which is great. We just want everyone to keep working hard and to keep pushing to get better every game.\u201d West Indies could muster only 131 in reply, losing nine wickets and among them a first international dismissal by the ODI debutant Bryony Smith. It means that the visitors \u2013 who sit seventh in the ICC Women\u2019s Championship table, with only Australia and India to face \u2013 have not only lost every match of this series, but probably also lost the chance to qualify automatically for the 2021 World Cup. It was a largely disappointing end to what has been a dismal series for them. With rain falling even at the toss, Stafanie Taylor had initially put England in to bat in the hope that her side could take advantage of the difficult batting conditions. Instead the ball \u2013 and, slowly, the match \u2013 slipped through their fingers, Hayley Matthews fumbling a catch at gully that would have seen off Tammy Beaumont while still in single figures. The opener eventually reached 46 before being adjudged leg-before to Afy Fletcher. In the interim the rain had caused a two-and-a-half-hour delay to proceedings, along with a reduction in overs: England responded with a barrage of boundaries. Beaumont\u2019s departure merely handed added impetus to Jones, who celebrated her 26th birthday by bringing up her fifth half-century in her last six ODI innings. Only a diving catch from Britney Cooper at deep midwicket was enough to see her off. \u201cI\u2019ve done some good work with the batting coach Ali Maiden and I feel in good form,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI love opening the batting and feel comfortable there. I\u2019ve been pretty good against spin, we\u2019ve worked on footwork and getting right to the ball, and I\u2019m happy it\u2019s paid off.\u201d Sarah Taylor hung around long enough to grind out 70 runs \u2013 her highest international score in 12 months \u2013 as she at last found some form before the women\u2019s Ashes. But it was Knight\u2019s big-hitting cameo in the closing overs which lifted England\u2019s total firmly into unassailable territory, the highlight a huge six over deep midwicket which almost sailed out of the ground. In response, Matthews had looked in ominous form, walloping Kate Cross down the ground for a huge maximum of her own. She was stopped in her tracks the very next ball though, by a breathtaking full-stretch diving catch from Fran Wilson at cover and which should be shown on repeat to anyone who ever professes scepticism about the women\u2019s game. From there, West Indies folded into themselves once again, not helped by the fact that Taylor was absent from proceedings, undergoing an X-ray on her right hand she injured in the field. West Indies will be praying she recovers in time for the T20 series which starts on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
