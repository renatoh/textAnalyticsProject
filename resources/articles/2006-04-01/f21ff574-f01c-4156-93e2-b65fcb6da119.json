No, not in that way, though there is a crackling sexual chemistry between Billie Piper and David Tennant. The Tardis drops them on New Earth in the galaxy M87 in the year 5,000,000,023. New Earth looks just like Dubai, though instead of immigrant workers the hospital is staffed by cats. Lady Cassandra is there (voiced by Zo\u00eb Wanamaker) stretched out on to a piece of skin like a human trampoline, until she takes over Rose's body. And the Face of Boe, a huge pickled head in a jar, like something in the Darwin Centre at the Natural History Museum. There are zombies by the thousand, horrible human lab rats, infected with every disease in the history of diseases. It's scary sci-fi, camp humour and warm family viewing all in one - Star Trek, Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead and Carry On. And it's wonderful. Tennant turns out to be a splendid Doctor - likable, funny and sexy. Piper continues to be brilliant and gorgeous. And Russell T Davies' script has given Doctor Who a whole new injection of life. At last there's something to watch on a Saturday evening - apart from CSI and Match of the Day, obviously. The second part of The Queen At 80 (BBC1, Sunday) looked into our head of state's role in the modern world, so I was expecting just a blank screen - but somehow they managed to fill an hour. I thought she seemed quite nice in this one. But where do the royal family get those voices? No one else in the world speaks like that. Don't they sometimes, when they're watching the telly, wonder why they speak a different language from the rest of the country? We get to see her meeting the prime minister for one of their chats. There's no crackling sexual chemistry here (eurgh, horrid thought, sorry). \"The Prime Minister, Your Majesty,\" says a footman, and in walks Tony Blair, fixed grin (dead genuine), arms hanging awkwardly. It's all quite awkward in fact: Tony tugs his ear, Elizabeth scratches an imaginary itch on her leg, both of them look as if they're loathing the whole experience and can't wait for it all to be over. Later we learn that ginger cake is the Duke of Edinburgh's favourite dish. I wonder if Harry's his favourite grandchild. We get to see a home movie of a young Elizabeth playing with her first child, holding a toy out for him, then moving it away as he tries to grab it. No wonder Charles now thinks the whole world is against him. The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant (ITV1, Sunday) is a story based on real events, we're told. With quite a lot of someone's fantasies thrown in, it would appear. Pretty Mary is caught stealing a bonnet, for which the punishment is to go to Australia. Not on Qantas though, but by prison ship, because this is 1786. The voyage is basically a soft porn movie. There's a lot of chest-heaving among the women prisoners, who have comedy West Country accents and keep falling out of their rags. They shower on deck, while lusty men in red uniforms stand by, muskets at the ready. Sex-starved male prisoners look on, their tongues hanging out. There's some cage action; sometimes there's a flogging to liven things up a bit. Or a storm to make it all wetter. This is more than just crackling sexual chemistry, it's more like playing with matches in the sexual fireworks factory. It all goes off. Mary goes with one of the uniformed dudes - Jack Davenport from This Life - because his prospects look promising and he's got a nice cabin. But then she also likes a bit of rough, so she snogs a con. Then, once they reach Botany Bay, it's back with Jack because she's hungry and she also needs to nick his keys so they can steal supplies when they make a dash for it in the governor's cutter. Yep, it looks like there's going to be another boat ride in part two tonight - two more hours of heaving lustiness, jealousy and cocked muskets. Blimey, I'm not sure I can take it. 12 Books That Changed the World (ITV1, Sunday) was a fascinating programme that Melvyn Bragg put on the telly by mistake, instead of on the radio where it belonged."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
