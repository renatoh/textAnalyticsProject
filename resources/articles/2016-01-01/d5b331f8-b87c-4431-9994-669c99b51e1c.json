First a federal government minister resigned over inappropriate behaviour towards a female public servant while out drinking in Hong Kong. Then that same minister, Jamie Briggs, sent out photos of the woman in question to his mates. Then those mates leaked the photo to the media. Then another federal minister, Peter Dutton, called a respected political journalist a \u201cmad fucking witch\u201d for having the temerity to publish an opinion on the matter. Then cricket star Chris Gayle told a female journalist she had beautiful eyes, asked her out and told her not to blush, baby. The men in the commentary box snickered, calling the cricketer \u201camorous\u201d and describing the journalist as scurrying off \u201cwith bright red cheeks\u201d. In such cases men often like to claim they didn\u2019t mean to offend the victim or that no harm was intended. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything meant to be disrespectful or offensive to Mel,\u201d said Chris Gayle. \u201cAt no point was it my intention to act inappropriately,\u201d said Jamie Briggs. But there is no grey area. It makes no difference whether women involved accepted an apology, whether it was a \u201cjoke\u201d, whether there was no harm intended, whether some people need to lighten up, whether the world has become a politically correct nightmare, whether it was just a bit of fun, whether it was supposed to be a compliment, whether it was not that bad \u2013 each act was blatantly and indisputably sexist. These platitudes are cold comfort to victims, yet they are the standard response to accusations of sexism. I\u2019m in a helpful mood, so I\u2019ll make this simple by putting in list form what, exactly, about the above events is sexist. It\u2019s for all the men who don\u2019t know which of their kind and magnanimous actions could be interpreted as sexist, creepy or inappropriate: Telling a junior female staff member that she has \u201cpiercing eyes\u201d is a sexist act. If you want to compliment a colleague, by all means tell her what great work she has been doing. Any comment on her looks is sexist. Charlotte Proudman has done a great job of explaining why women should not \u201cpassively accept being objectified\u201d in the workplace. Kissing a female staff member on her cheek or her neck is a sexist act. If you feel like touching a female staff member in any way, don\u2019t. Trying to excuse your behaviour because the woman involved smiled on the evening in question is a sexist act. This is called victim blaming. Just because you are having fun with a woman and she is laughing at your jokes does not mean she wants to go home with you, wants you to kiss her, touch her, give her a compliment or ask her out. If you are accused of acting inappropriately towards a woman and you subsequently send a photo of her to your mates, it is not respecting her privacy, it is insinuating she was asking for it. She wasn\u2019t. Calling a woman a \u201cmad fucking witch\u201d is a sexist act. This should need no explanation given Australia\u2019s recent history of calling female prime ministers \u201cwitches\u201d. Equally, the long history of labelling women who don\u2019t please men as \u201cmad\u201d or \u201ccrazy\u201d should preclude this from even being a topic of conversation. But if you really don\u2019t understand, Harris O\u2019Malley wrote a helpful blog on the Washington Post dissecting what it means when men call women \u201ccrazy\u201d. Asking a journalist out during an interview is a sexist act. It\u2019s an interview, not a nightclub, as Cricket Australia boss James Sutherland pointed out. A woman working in her professional capacity deserves to have her questions answered in a professional manner. Calling a woman \u201cbaby\u201d in a professional setting is a sexist act. Unless you are in a relationship with a woman, it\u2019s probably a good idea to avoid calling her \u201cbaby\u201d, \u201cbabes\u201d, \u201cdarling\u201d, \u201csweetheart\u201d, \u201cpetal\u201d, \u201cfloss\u201d or \u201clove\u201d. Making light of \u2013 or dismissing \u2013 sexist acts is a sexist act. Here\u2019s a tip: if you witness a colleague being humiliated in public, don\u2019t tell her to walk away, laugh it off or make a joke out of it. Call out the sexism, don\u2019t comment on her \u201cbright red cheeks\u201d or tell her to stand next to you instead. Don\u2019t ever ask a woman to adjust her behaviour to avoid sexist acts. Step in to stop the sexist act. If you\u2019re still having trouble figuring out what\u2019s sexist or inappropriate behaviour, there\u2019s a pretty simple test available to all and it takes a mere second. It goes like this: would you do/say this to a male colleague? If the answer is no, then what you\u2019re about to do is probably sexist. It is obscene that in 2016 I feel it necessary to write this list. But the excuses, the apologies, the deleted tweets and the vitriol prove that it is. Perhaps I am so worked up because on Sunday night a stranger in a restaurant leaned over from the table next to me and felt my breast. This was shortly after he had thrown money at me, then put it behind my back where he conveniently had to touch my backside in order to retrieve it. When I told the man he had no right to touch me, he stuck his middle finger in my face so aggressively he had to be restrained by another man. When I told his elderly companion what he\u2019d done, he looked away, as though I was making him uncomfortable. When the man and his companions were escorted out of the restaurant after I complained, he had to be restrained by two other men. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d he yelled as he lurched towards me. He was so angry I complained, he felt I needed to be punished further, apparently, and more violently this time. His companions eventually apologised to me, but only after apologising to my boyfriend, and only after being kicked out by restaurant staff who reinforced that the behaviour was unacceptable. I don\u2019t think the sexist behaviour displayed by politicians and sports stars is unrelated to the sexist behaviour displayed by middle-aged men in well-to-do Sydney restaurants. If we accept degrading treatment of women in politics, in sport or in public life, then we support it in private life, too. We send a message: this is OK, boys; the girls are there for your pleasure. We now know by heart the words used by David Morrison when he was trying to bring about a change in attitude towards women in the Australian army. \u201cThe standard you walk past is the standard you accept,\u201d he said. This past week, many Australians have made it clear they\u2019re not willing to walk past these sexist acts. We\u2019re saying: All the MPs who have defended Jamie Briggs\u2019s behaviour or bemoaned his resignation are walking past and accepting the sexist treatment of women. All the people who have excused Peter Dutton\u2019s text message to Samantha Maiden are walking past and accepting sexist behaviour and attitudes to women. All the people calling the reaction to Chris Gayle\u2019s comments a beat-up or an overreaction, are accepting that women deserve to be treated as objects of sexual gratification for men. We\u2019ve now been four months without a sex discrimination commissioner. Never has it been so clear how much we need one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
