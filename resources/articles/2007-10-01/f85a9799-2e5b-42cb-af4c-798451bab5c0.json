'It was a great relief, and crossing the line first was pretty special.' She started at 17, rowing first for a club in Cornwall, then for Cambridge University. 'I've climbed my way up the rankings and came second in the British trials last winter.' Training is tough. 'I train three times a day and occasionally get Sunday off. It's an all-day, all-night job. I think you've got to have a burning desire to do it - sometimes I love it and sometimes I hate it.' She hasn't had any injuries so far. 'I come from good farming stock, so I'm strong. I eat as many Cornish pasties as I can. It's about timing meals rather than what you eat.' Now she's focusing on the Olympics, 'although I try not to aim everything at one goal. A medal is just a medal; it's about how you feel while you're doing it that counts.' She has rowed in double and single boats before. 'A crew boat can be quite intense so it's about the mix of personalities. A good boat with good people - that's what's important.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
