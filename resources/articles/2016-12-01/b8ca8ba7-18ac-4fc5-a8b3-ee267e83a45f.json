A phone call can mean a lot", "bodyText": "Some of us enjoy solitude. But when you have no choice, and are stuck with too much of it, it can easily turn into loneliness, which is no pleasure at all. There are more than a million older people in England whose lives are blighted by loneliness \u2013 and now we have Christmas rubbing it in, as usual. There is nothing more miserable than sleeping, waking, eating and doing more or less everything alone \u2013 especially for anyone single, separated or widowed, and in poor health \u2013 while the rest of the country seems to be playing happy families, or at least trying to. And most of us are much too busy to help some old person whose existence we\u2019re not even aware of. Age UK has launched a befriending service in which older people are matched with volunteers to receive a 20\u201330 minute phone call each week. It doesn\u2019t sound much, one call a week, but when your weeks stretch endlessly ahead, punctuated by nothing except perhaps the odd lightning visit from a carer who has barely a moment to speak, then a friendly weekly phone call and chat can mean a lot. Last week I sat in one morning with the charity, and heard Nicky chatting to Mavis. They sounded like old friends, talking of families, Christmas plans, the cats\u2019 behaviour, and laughing. Mavis said she was having a busy time. She\u2019d made eight Christmas cakes, was about to go out, and had two church events. But Nicky promised to call her on Christmas Day. \u201cWill you really?\u201d asked Mavis. \u201cThank you, sweetheart. I do love you.\u201d The calls may sound lightweight, but the cheery small talk can often conceal a heartbreaking situation. Stephanie calls Eva, who has a Christmas lunch the next day, \u201cthen nothing till after New Year. I\u2019ll just watch TV, see if any visitors call. Last year I sat here with a box of chocolates. Did a jigsaw. Enjoyed it. A bit of me time. I get loads of that anyway. I always was a Christmas person, but now the children are gone. You can still put up a little tree, can\u2019t you, bit of glitter? We can\u2019t come back. It\u2019s not a dress rehearsal. You have to do the best you can.\u201d And then Eva explains why the past two years have been particularly difficult. \u201cMy husband decided to retire overseas, took me with him, then left me. Mind over matter. Sitting down with the box of tissues achieves nothing.\u201d It must be very hard to have thoughts of such an event swirling round your head. But talking to someone sympathetic, even a relative stranger such as Stephanie, who is happy to listen, seems to help. The sadness in Eva\u2019s voice is deeply affecting, although she is trying to disguise it and, like many lonely older people, she is putting on a brave face. Bette Davis was right when she said: \u201cOld age is not for sissies.\u201d In later life, after a break-up or death of a partner, you can\u2019t go off to work, or anywhere much, to distract yourself from thoughts of what you have lost and miss. Almost more than anything else, you may need someone to talk to. Three years ago Sally Lubamov, 86, was asked by the Today programme what she most wanted from her home carers. She replied, \u201cFor them to have enough time for a chat and a sit-down and a hot meal with me.\u201d It\u2019s not much to ask. Last week Today visited her again. She had been very ill, but was thrilled to have at last had that hot meal, three weeks ago. \u201cFirst time for a year!\u201d The telephone relationships work both ways. Dean, a 24-year-old Tottenham supporter, chats to Joe, an 80-year-old Birmingham City fan, every week for half an hour. They talk football, and \u201call the things Joe has been through, the hurricanes in Jamaica, how the winds made the fruit crash from the trees,\u201d says Dean. \u201cWe come from very different worlds, and our friendship has really changed me. He has a contagious spirit and he\u2019s given me the confidence to speak to people I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d consider him a friend \u2026 [It\u2019s] not just something I do because I volunteered.\u201d Joe\u2019s wife died in 1991, and he now has very limited mobility, but talking to Dean also cheers him up: \u201cHe\u2019s like another grandson to me \u2013 very pleasant to talk to.\u201d Older people are also very pleasant to talk to, and interesting and amusing. They have a lifetime of experience to talk about, given half a chance. But they need to talk all year round, not just at Christmas.
