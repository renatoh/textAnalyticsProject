I play piano to a very high standard, but when I left university I didn't want to play full-time, so I got into arts management and was tour manager for the London Festival Orchestra. When an orchestra goes on tour, there can be from 20 to 120 people involved. You need to contact all the promoters in each city you want to visit and sort out payment. It's so expensive to tour. There's an old saying that it's cheaper to fly an orchestra home between gigs than have too many off days while on tour. There's hotel costs and the per diems, it adds up to a fortune. When you're touring all over the world it's better to be paid in cash rather than a cheque issued by a bank you've never heard of. So at the interval I'd be counting the money. It's not a question of distrust, it just makes good business sense to check you've been paid. There was a gig in Germany, somewhere near Mannheim, and we were flying out of Frankfurt. I had a bag with 5,000 deutschmarks in. I went to the airport early in the morning, so I was tired. I made a mistake and checked in the bag full of cash. I asked the check-in person if they could stop the belt; they said it would cost DM300 but I could retrieve the bag at the gate and it wouldn't cost anything. At the gate I got the bag, opened it and found that the money had gone, except for a few odd notes. This was in 1991, and at the time it was a lot of money. Today I could absorb, say, \u20ac5,000 if I really had to; but DM5,000 was a sum so large it might as well have been \u00a350,000. Back in London I had to phone people and tell them the money had gone. I got my girlfriend, who had been with me at the time, to write a letter to my boss explaining exactly what happened and that I had made a mistake. But the awful suspicion was there that I had stolen the money myself. It was a costly mistake. I agreed a plan to repay over a year, and by the time a year had passed I had finally made the jump into comedy full-time. I see tour managers now and sometimes book my own tours, so I know what they are going through. My main advice is to be very careful at airports and never check in anything valuable. Years later I went to a concert in South Africa and overheard a guy telling a story about a wallet that went missing between the check-in and the gate. Where did it happen? Frankfurt airport!
