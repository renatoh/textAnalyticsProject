The 48-year-old was unveiled at a packed Anfield press conference on Friday where he described himself as the Normal One, vowed to bring \u201cemotional football\u201d to Liverpool and embraced the club\u2019s often criticised transfer committee system. He also targeted a trophy within four years or his next job, he suggested, would be in Switzerland. Later, away from the television cameras, he signalled an immediate departure from the Brendan Rodgers era by declaring it was premature to discuss football philosophies or possession tactics. Rodgers did precisely that at his unveiling as Liverpool manager. Klopp claimed Liverpool\u2019s intense approach to football, as a city and a club, had persuaded him to abandon a sabbatical after four months and sign a three-year contract with \u201cthe cool guys\u201d of Fenway Sports Group. Seemingly surprised at his status as one of the biggest draws in the Premier League, he also appealed for privacy having been photographed at his hotel window in the city on Thursday. \u201cI am not the guy who is going to go out and shout: \u2018We are going to conquer the world!\u2019 or something like this. But we will conquer the ball, each fucking time. We will chase the ball. We will run more, fight more,\u201d said the former Borussia Dortmund coach, who will earn up to \u00a37m a year at Anfield. He added: \u201cThe only thing I need is players that want to help the team. They have to listen to what I say. \u201cThat is very important because I believe it is better to have 11 players do the same thing wrong than everybody doing what they want. We have to do it one way and that is my way. Now we cannot talk about football philosophy and ball possession, playing like Barcelona, playing like whoever. No, this team needs to create their own style. \u201cIf you have the ball you have to be creative but you have to be prepared that if you lose the ball the counter-pressing is very important. \u201cIt is very important in football. It is not a proposal, it is law. \u201cYou have to do it and you will. That is what we all have to learn, maybe. I\u2019m only interested in 100% of each player. Now we have to work on that.\u201d Klopp revealed he spent his four months out of the game with family, playing tennis and watching football around the world. But, having joined Liverpool despite being linked with title-challenging teams guaranteeing Champions League football, such as Bayern Munich, he denied relishing an underdog status. \u201cI enjoy being an underdog? No,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cFor managers it is very important that you can influence the things on the pitch, that you can change the things in a better direction, of course. I\u2019ve never seen or been talking to these other clubs. I don\u2019t think about things like this. I\u2019ve never had a plan for my career. I react on what happens and I hear what I feel inside. For me, it fits perfect.\u201d The Stuttgart-born coach made frequent references to the Premier League\u2019s obsession with money and, in another departure from several previous Liverpool managers, insisted it would not define his ability to construct a successful team. Asked whether Liverpool could attract a player of the calibre of Marco Reus without Champions League football, having failed to entice several targets during Rodgers\u2019 reign, Klopp replied: \u201cI absolutely don\u2019t care about this. \u201cIf we cannot sign a player like him then we are not interested in him. We will have to take other players. The whole world plays football, there are players everywhere. \u201cIt is only here that money is such a big thing. It is money, money, money. OK, there is much money. You don\u2019t have to spend all the money. You can hold it and make something else. Of course, not having Champions League football is a problem, it is a negative. Of course, it should be a target for all ambitious teams to play in the Champions League, for sure. But only four go in. You have to fight for it, not just talk about it. You don\u2019t have to speak always. \u201cYou have to look at which players are reachable and not dream of this player or that player and then say: \u2018But they don\u2019t want to come to Liverpool.\u2019 If a player doesn\u2019t want to come to Liverpool then stay away. Really. If you think about the weather, stay away. If you think about other things, stay away. If you want to come here, you are welcome. That is the first and most important issue.\u201d Klopp admitted he had watched Liverpool\u2019s last three games before his appointment \u2013 Everton, FC Sion in the Europa League and the 3-2 win over Aston Villa eight days before Rodgers\u2019 departure. \u201cThree until now and ask me on Sunday and I will have seen 20,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
