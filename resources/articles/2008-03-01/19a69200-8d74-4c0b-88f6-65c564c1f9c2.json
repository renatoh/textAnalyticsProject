The 10-day literary carnival, sponsored by the Guardian, will celebrate its 21st anniversary in the Welsh border town - home to 39 bookshops - from May 22. The Right Reverend Gene Robinson, the only openly gay Anglican bishop, will be talking about his book In the Eye of the Storm. The economist Joseph Stiglitz will discuss the calculations that led to his latest work, The $3 Trillion War: The True Cost of War in Iraq. Brad Bird, Oscar winner and director of the animated films The Incredibles and Rataouille, the writer Alan Bennett, and the veteran Russian chess player Boris Spassky will also be making their debuts at Hay. Carter will be talking about the Middle East, the midwest, and international intervention. Booth, activist lawyer and wife of former prime minister Tony Blair, will be addressing women's equality under the title of Making Your Way In A Man's World, and Clarkson will veer into the subject of Cars and Comedy. Other guests will include Naomi Klein, John Irving, Gore Vidal and Ian McEwan. Hanif Kureishi will speak about his latest novel, Something To Tell You, and Karen Armstrong - author of The Bible: A Biography - will explore one of the most influential texts of all time. Music will be provided by Jools Holland, the Malian band Tinariwen and Son de la Frontera. \u00b7 The box office will open in mid-April.
