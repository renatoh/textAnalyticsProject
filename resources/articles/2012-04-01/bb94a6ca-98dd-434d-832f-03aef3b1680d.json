Now seeking funds for its campaigns in Afghanistan, Iraq, DR Congo and Uganda, War Child has recruited prog techno pioneers Leftfield to curate its latest event. Leftfield's rare live outings are generally stern but impressive aurally and visually, with remaining original member Neil Barnes accompanied by a crack live band and a procession of guest vocalists (including Tessa Jowell's daughter Jess Mills). Support comes from German minimal techno duo Booka Shade, and their Get Physical labelmates MANDY are on hand to play records between the bands, alongside tech-assisted deck virtuosos James Zabiela and Laurent Garnier. O2 Academy Brixton, SW9, Sat Sam Richards Ghosts Of Garage, Manchester Although its name suggests some kind of retrospective, it's not strictly revivalism that's drawn over 600 people to each of this night's previous instalments. Garage is an integral part of a current multi-genre soundtrack that's just as British as its immediate precursor. Making his first Manchester guest appearance in over a decade is Noodles, who has headed evergreen production outfit Groove Chronicles since the mid-90s, supported by Chimpo and Chunky. Moho Live, Tib Street, Fri Marc Rowlands Deviation V Hyperdub, London Founded in 2004 by heavyweight dub theorist Steve Goodman AKA Kode9 (pictured), Hyperdub quickly established itself as one of the UK's foremost electronic music labels with the release of the first two Burial albums. Foraging far beyond dubstep's pastures, Hyperdub has since focused primarily on UK producers making strange and exciting noises. Most of them are due to make an appearance at this hook-up with Benji B's Deviation, so if you've never heard Cooly G, Ikonika, DVA, Ossie or Ill Blu, it's time to go and get your brain rewired. There are stellar guests, too: Dutch maestro Martyn, Detroit techno provocateur Omar-S and 4 Hero's Dego. Secret location, Fri SR Asylum Sessions, Dublin Dapper chap and international club promoter Robert Baker has just added Dublin to the list of host cities for his globetrotting indie club night, Asylum Sessions. Joining Vienna, Paris, New York and, er, Swindon as past, present and future locations for his peripatetic project, Dublin's Grand Social prepares for its first bi-monthly session, combining performances by local live acts, plus deckside stints by big-name guests. Tonight's launch sees Babyshambles sticksman, Roses Kings Castles singer and in-demand festival mixer Adam Ficek spinning one of his usual dynamic DJ sets containing classic indie, rock, and up-to-the-minute dancefloor electro, interspersed with his trademark \"Ficekedits\" and \"Electrindie\" mash-ups. The night kicks off with a few tunes from Baker himself, while Dublin bands Gavin James &amp; The Problematic, Orphan Code, and the Heritage Centre play live sets and compete for the chance to play at one of Asylum Sessions' gigs outside Ireland. Grand Social, Lower Liffey Street, Sat Patric Baird Teachings In Dub, Bristol TiD is a collaboration between DJ Stryda (AKA Sam Howard) and Digistep (Ben Glass) who have both worked tirelessly in recent years promoting the city's dub scene under their Dubkasm moniker. Friday's session is an eagerly awaited soundsystem clash between London-based Jah Tubbys and Bristol's own Jah Lokko. Originally hailing from east London, Jah Tubbys has been delivering serious basslines for over 40 years while Jah Lokko's recently revamped system should ensure that hometown pride remains intact.
