Edinburgh-based Moishe's Bagel may lack exotic signifiers (from a UK perspective), but the \"world\" category suits them better than \"roots\" or \"folk\". What you get from this accomplished, entertaining quintet is a mostly original repertoire (largely written by talented pianist Phil Alexander) that makes reference to Argentinian, Balkan and Brazilian dance musics, Latin and folk. In their hands, such distinctive rhythmic forms sound surprisingly compatible: Give Me a Lift to Tsafat/Odessa Bulgar swirls away like Scots klezmer with tablas; El Coche Amarillo is an asymmetrical bolero; Tantz Glassidic is a clever Philip Glass spoof/homage. The album may lack the recording and production sophistication of better funded acts, but their performance qualities are loud and clear. This hard-working, entertaining band will tour the UK for most of April: well worth catching."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
