But this is not the only issue of concern. Parliament is being rushed into a profound change that threatens the very idea of public universities, publicly funded. The 50-year expansion of English higher education has been driven by sustained public investment coupled with high levels of autonomy for institutions. The excellence of top research universities is matched by the richness and diversity of provision across higher education. Successive governments' willingness to trust the leadership of universities has produced impressive results. It should not be lightly set aside. Under the coalition, direct public funding of most undergraduate teaching is to end, with the teaching grant cut by 80%. Many universities will lose up to 90% of their public funding. In future, most students will carry the whole cost of their degrees, paying back for up to 30 years. The near trebling of the fee cap to \u00a39,000 a year, with maintenance loans on top, is intended to create a market in which student choice shapes the size of universities and courses on offer. This is no rerun of Labour's introduction of fees. These gave universities extra income beyond the feasible limits of public investment. We backed Lord Dearing's principle that graduates should top-up public funding as they gained personally from higher education. The coalition breaks this principle; its plans are not financial but ideological. Fees of \u00a37,000-\u00a38,000 a year are needed simply to replace lost income. They will contribute little to deficit reduction. The plans are an ideological gamble \u2013 withdrawing public money from universities and pushing through a perceived market \u2013 with little fiscal benefit in the short term, turmoil for universities, and mountains of debt for students. A balanced approach to deficit reduction is needed, securing growth while bringing borrowing down. It does not mean cutting the teaching grant by 80%. And there is no need to bet the whole house on a new higher education market. Of course, the current system is far from perfect. We cannot brush aside concerns about quality or graduate employability. We need more opportunities to progress from vocational qualifications into relevant degrees. A fairer deal for part-time students is welcome. Student choice is one, but only one, of the mechanisms we should use to drive change. The coalition's full-blooded market approach is founded on shaky ground. Students won't all make their choices equipped with the same knowledge, aspiration and confidence. Family and educational advantage and perceived university reputations will be the strongest drivers of demand. Fees of \u00a39,000 could divert some students to the cheapest course, not the best. The coalition implicitly admits market failure by continuing to fund science and engineering teaching. It knows neither students nor society value these skills highly enough. But are the arts, humanities, or degrees that support design, entrepreneurship and the creative economy so unimportant we don't care what choices are made? Labour will defend the principle of public education. We will oppose the fee increase, and the railroading of parliament into an early decision. Universities minister David Willetts wants a vote on fees now, but will only publish a white paper in March. Lib Dem MPs are being asked to break election promises before they can answer simple questions: how will student numbers be controlled? Will \"fair repayment\" be put into law? How will plans to improve access be given teeth? Will new organisations be allowed to offer degrees, on what terms? The stakes are too high for such profound change in higher education to pass without challenge and proper scrutiny."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
