Try reading it while replacing \"the RAF\" with \"children's services\" and you'll see what I mean. The notion of the RAF \"not wanting to scale back and lose its global reach\" is equally worrying \u2013 public services, of which the RAF is one, all have to follow the dictates of parliament. I look forward to you interviewing Matt Dunkley, president of the Association of Directors of Children's Services, and not relegating it to page 5 of Society Guardian but splashing it on page 1 of the main paper. John Freeman Joint president of ADCS 2007-08 \u2022\u2008We fail to understand what Kenneth Branagh has done to earn such undiluted bile (The star who forgot how to shine, Film &amp; Music, 1 April). Perhaps Branagh is happy to be known as an excellent actor, a good director, and an unassuming champion of the arts. I don't remember him ever saying he was the new Olivier. Nicola and Bob Grove London \u2022\u2008AC Grayling asks how someone can be a militant atheist (G2, 4 April). It is quite simple. If atheism is promoted in a militant manner, using, for example, the power of the state to harass, arrest or even kill those who disagree, then over 20% of the world's population during the last century could have been said to live under the rule of militant atheism. Dr Andrew Pinsent Harris Manchester College, Oxford \u2022 So the idea that each sheep might have a unique distinctive personality is quite modern, academically speaking (Improbable research, Education Guardian, 5 April). Just shows these clever university people never talked to a shepherd.
