Twist: Donald Trump retweeted an unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz. Latest: Ted Cruz took vigorous exception. Trump photo compares wife with Cruz\u2019s Cruz called Trump a \u201csniveling coward\u201d and \u201ca small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women\u201d. \u201cLeave Heidi the hell alone,\u201d Cruz said at a campaign stop in Wisconsin. Trump response TBD. Ex-candidate Ben Carson found himself on The View, where co-host Whoopi Goldberg asked why he backed Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a racist, and he\u2019s not good for the country,\u201d Goldberg said.

Sanders also snagged a superdelegate, who pledged his support on the strength of Sanders\u2019 78% Idaho win. Clinton is beating Sanders: blame the people Cruz popped up in Wisconsin, which will award 42 GOP delegates on 5 April and stands as a crucial test of Cruz\u2019s challenge to Trump. \u201cThe entire country is looking to Wisconsin,\u201d Cruz tweeted. Three polls out late Wednesday had Trump as the top pick of Republican voters by an average of eight points. Models disagree, however, on whether he can collect a majority of delegates at stake. But even if Trump falls short of the magic delegates number, 63% of respondents in a Bloomberg poll thought he should be the nominee, as long as he remains in the lead. Joe Biden said an old speech he gave arguing against nominating supreme court justices in election years has been misinterpreted. \u201cThere is no \u2018Biden rule\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false}}}
