Golf is officially back at the Olympics; the opening round of the men\u2019s competition passing off in a strolling haze of putts and chips and team-branded nylon slacks on a breezy, intoxicating day on Rio\u2019s suburban coastline. Nobody at Rio 2016 really knew what to expect from this. Like a star fleet cruiser shaking and shuddering as it barrels its way through a passing asteroid belt, these Olympic Games have so far just about held together through a bumpy, often thrilling opening week. Golf, though, was something else. The good walk spoiled has been a relentlessly divisive addition ever since the set-list for Rio 2016 was announced seven years ago. Some have objected on ideological grounds to the intrusion of a voraciously elitist sport into Pierre de Coubertin\u2019s sickly vision of a Corinthian games for all. Others point to the obvious inequities of conjuring from nowhere, a stunningly manicured Olympic golf course in the green fringes of a city currently running on empty. Recently there have been pull-outs and no-shows, evidence of a lack of enthusiasm for the project among the mercenary princelings of the elite circuit. At the end of which, it was almost a little jarring to find nothing more complex on the opening morning than a group of flamboyantly sweatered men pinging balls around with surgical severity on a beautifully carved stretch of green on the coastal plateau of Barra da Tijuca. In a moment of touching home Games propaganda, the first tee shot was hit by Adilson da Silva. Da Silva is Brazil\u2019s only entrant, and a circuit veteran who, so the story goes, learnt to play as a boy with sticks whittled down into the shape of clubs. After which golf\u2019s grand return was gripping enough. The Australian Marcus Fraser finished top of the board on eight under par. Britain\u2019s Justin Rose produced a first ever Olympic hole in one, some very handy catnip to the highlights reel and rolling news package. There was time to dwell on the absentees too. Women\u2019s golf, which follows the men\u2019s, has embraced the chance for a little exposure here, with all the top players present, including 19-year-old World No 1 Lydia Ko. But the top four men were all absent at tee time, each citing fear of the Zika virus, as was the reigning Olympic champ George Lyon of Canada, who has a better excuse having died in 1939, 34 years after the last golf Games in Saint Louis. Beyond this the most striking feature of golf at Rio 2016 was the jaw-dropping beauty of the course. Designed by the American architect Gil Hanse, it is a lovely desert Telletubbyland of swooping green swells, long grass scrub and sandy no-man\u2019s land, the kind of course that might have popped up had Sergio Leone ever extended his spaghetti Western franchise into a golf-based movie. Here surface held up well, with no evidence of the brittleness many had feared from a brand new course. The owls, monkeys, mini-crocodiles and venomous snakes said to roam its links stayed away. Best of all was the outline of Rio de Janeiro itself, the shadow of the local hills and the distant Corcovado mountains, with the distinctive fug of mist that bubbles up and burns away creating an odd wintry haze. It seems safe to say Golf at Rio 2016 will work. The competition is robust enough. The course is lovely. The only real question left is the big one: what exactly is it doing here in the first place? The last person of any note to seriously insist this was a good idea was Adolf Hitler, who held his own mini-Olympic golf tournament in Berlin, commemorated by The Hitler Trophy, currently in the possession of a golf club in Southport. It isn\u2019t hard to see why golf should want in. For all the money sluicing through the top end, these are still troubled times. Golf\u2019s scope is shrinking back. Nike and Adidas have announced in recent months a withdrawal from making equipment. The Olympics is another revenue-generator, another teat to be suckled for a sport entirely contorted by the lure of Big Sponsorship. Quite why the Olympics should want golf is another question, given the sport satisfies none of the usual criteria: this is not, in any sense a \u201cpinnacle\u201d event for golf; neither is golf a universal or even particularly widespread activity. It is, though, a rich one. And from this perspective it isn\u2019t hard to see why the two might get on. Golf has long been a blandly corporate, hysterically sponsor-driven money-raking machine. Whereas the Olympics remain a hysterically corporate, blandly sponsor-driven machine for making money. Rich people are here. There are bucks to be made. Come on in. The corporate schmoozifying at these Rio Games is, as ever, breathtakingly bold and blinged up. The watchmaker Omega has set up a VIP cocktail lounge in a beach-front building thronged with diverse A-list guests (Wednesday night was drinks with Buzz Aldrin). Elsewhere business-pitching stands have mushroomed up in the corporate-ambassadorial nexus of places such as USA House and Club France. Nissan launched a new car here the other day, projecting its shiny face across the facade of a seafront hotel. Citius, altius, bigger business is the new modern Olympic creed. Golf, which looked lovely here, which will always produce outstanding moments, but which in truth offers little in the way of homey old Olympic cheer, will for now be a welcome guest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
