In a letter sent to the UN security council, the New York-based group accused Sudan of breaking a promise to allow troops into Darfur after a partial peace deal in May. Instead a weak African Union peacekeeping mission was left to carry on. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, said last month that a UN force should be deployed. It would relieve the African Union mission, which has little more than observer status."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
