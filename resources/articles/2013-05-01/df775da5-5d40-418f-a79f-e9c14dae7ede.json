Inhabited by thwarted goldrush castoffs \u2013 crazed land-dwelling pirates \u2013 and a still sizable Native American population. The Oregon Trail, a perilous hike across thousands of miles \u2013 and two icy mountain ranges \u2013 was often a one-way proposition, and appealed mainly to the desperate and the crazy. For a long time, the Pacific Northwest (NW to residents) was even wilder than most of the wild west. Now, we're very civilised. The culture has an almost Scandinavian bearing. Our politics are liberal and we are bookish, very polite. As a home to Microsoft, Amazon, Starbucks, Boeing, Nike and much of Intel, millionaires abound, but even our rich people are demure. I once saw a mink coat here with the fur on the inside \u2013 from the outside it looked like an army-green raincoat. If you're planning to visit, don't rent a monstrous SUV or a canary-yellow Mustang. In the summer months, hire a convertible, because you're about to experience the best weather of your life. The other nine months of the year, bring waterproof boots, and skip the convertible. We're stuck indoors much of the year watching the drizzle, but people here don't own umbrellas: using an umbrella is admitting defeat. But we don't mind if you use one. There's even a trendy umbrella store downtown called Bella Umbrellas. The store is in Pike Place Market , which is a mandatory stop for visitors. Ostensibly a farmer's market, Pike Place is best known for its theatrical flair: fishmongers toss a giant salmon like a hot potato (grim aside: the fish in question is quickly rendered inedible by all the abuse, and gets discarded at the end of the day). The original Starbucks is there, too, among the 200 small businesses that inhabit the underground warrens and brick streets (bricks that were ships' ballasts in the 19th century). Slip down Post Alley and find The Pink Door, a hidden Italian joint where burlesque trapeze artists swing overhead while you eat. After dinner, ask a local for a recommendation for morning coffee. In the NW, we're truly obsessed with coffee. It's a cliche, yes, and it's true. Ever felt the urge to visit a drive-through coffee stall operated by young women in bikinis? Good news \u2013 there are several chains, but of questionable quality. There are also hundreds of beloved cafes (where the baristas wear clothes), with many roasting their own beans, including Portland's Stumptown Coffee Roasters and Seattle's Caffe Ladro. For a more blue-collar Seattle experience, drive north, weaving around sailboat-dotted Lake Union, and make your way to the Ballard neighbourhood. This independent fishing town was annexed by Seattle in 1907 (it's still a sore subject: you'll see \"Free Ballard\" bumper stickers everywhere). Ballard's farmer's market is a quintessential Northwest culinary experience you'll find curly green fiddleheads (the delicious young fronds of a local fern) and live geoduck clams at the fishmongers. If you don't feel like preparing your own geoduck, you're only a couple blocks from The Walrus and The Carpenter, a stylish new oyster bar serving an array of molluscs and sea creatures, including geoducks. Ballard is the NW in miniature. Bearded hipsters converge for pricey cocktails at Sexton, the cheekily named bistro in the spot that was once supposedly home to a brothel. A couple of blocks away, you can unwind at a working-class greasy spoon-style diner Hattie's Hat, which opened in 1904, and still reeks from a century of burning tobacco and spilled whisky. When Hattie's Hat first opened, the Northwest was a hotbed for crimping, or Shanghaiing, the practise of coercing or kidnapping able-bodied men \u2013 often temporarily incapacitated by strong drink \u2013 to work aboard merchant ships. You'd be innocently guzzling a pint of your favourite grain alcohol at Hattie's Hat one minute, and the next, you'd wake up with a bad headache on a schooner bound for Indochina. Another route out of Seattle involves driving on to the ferry to Bainbridge Island, which nuzzles the Olympic peninsula on the opposite side of the Puget Sound. You can play spot the mountain during the ride: it's a great place to see Rainier, the Olympics and the distant Cascades ranges. It's a 30-minute trip, so even if you are hungover, you'll survive. Bainbridge is a fine place for lunch, probably at Harbour Public House, which was built by a pious veteran of the civil war in the 1880s, but today offers views of the boats bobbing in Eagle Harbor. After lunch, carry on to Port Townsend at the peninsula's northeastern rim. Walk or ski on the peninsula's soaring Olympic mountain range, weather permitting. If weather doesn't permit, entertain yourself in the city itself. Port Townsend was supposed to be the big city \u2013 back then it was speculated that it would be the largest harbour on the whole US west coast \u2013 but being surrounded by water on three sides, it wasn't exactly on the way to anywhere else. During the economic collapse of 1890s, the railway robbed the city of its dream, and focused on another port across the sound, Seattle. Move south along Route 101 and arrive in Astoria, just across the border in Oregon. Grand Victorian houses \u2013 many of them long vacant \u2013 fill Astoria, along with cafes, eerie antique shops, moustachioed bail bondsmen and hipsters. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark's western expedition, spent the miserable, rain-filled winter of 1805-06 in a cabin here. They hoped someone would send a ship to fetch them. That didn't happen, so they turned around and hiked home. Continuing down the coast, ignore the cheesy casinos, and head for the blustery fishing town of Newport, Oregon. If you have kids in tow, there's a charming but slightly underwhelming aquarium that features an underwater Plexiglas tunnel. Stay at the quaint Sylvia Beach Hotel, perched atop a cliff by the beach. Each of the rooms is named and decorated in honour of an author. My wife and I stayed in the Robert Louis Stevenson, which is the cheapest, but if you prefer to travel like Poirot, go for the Agatha Christie. Finally, ascend through the twisting mountain roads to Portland, a few hours inland. Timber is still a big industry in the NW, and majestic evergreens are especially notable on this stretch. Stately Douglas firs and burly cedars are \"really something\", as Agent Dale Cooper memorably said on David Lynch's suitably weird Twin Peaks. If you can, spring for the elegant Heathman Hotel in Portland. The hotel's cosy library is home to signed copies from the hundreds of authors who have stayed there, including yours truly. Portland is a bit smaller and weirder than Seattle, and has a vigorous food-van economy. There are car parks all over town filled with vans offering every kind of food imaginable, including Korean tacos. There are also dozens of exceptional breakfast joints, but you would be remiss if you didn't make room for Tasty N Sons, and the best breakfast I've ever had: Moroccan chicken hash. Yes, it sounds bizarre, but this is Portland, where bizarre goes to retire. If you're disappointed, send me your receipt and I will mail you a photo of my disbelieving face. Portland is flat, with well-signed bike paths, so ditch your car while in town and rent a city bike or a surrey with the fringe on top (horse carriage) \u2013 if you fancy having a sing! As with many Northwest cities, Portland has a fantastic arboretum, the Hoyt Arboretum. And downtown, there's a small, but surprisingly effective amphitheatre in Pioneer Square, where, if you stand in the right spot, and speak in a normal voice, your words will echo back loudly \u2013 the perfect place for an impromptu political invective. But most importantly, you have to go to the downtown branch of Powell's City of Books, which claims to be the largest independent bookstore in the world, and merits an afternoon's perusal. The NW is book crazy \u2013 perhaps due to all that rain \u2013 and even small towns have superb independent bookstores. (Seattle's 11-storey, glass-faced Central Library, designed by Rem Koolhaas, is one arresting testament to the region's bibliophile soul.) Finally, no trip to the Pacific Northwest would be complete without time spent in a McMenamins establishment. McMenamins owns hotels and restaurants throughout the region, all decorated with a unique and whimsical style that's pure NW: equal parts hippy paint-job and oddball yard-sale flotsam. The Edgefield Hotel (doubles from $70), once a dilapidated old farm in quiet countryside by the Columbia river gorge east of Portland, is a great spot for a relaxing weekend. For a more rambunctious experience, try the Kennedy School, a former primary school in Portland, now home to a hotel, movie-theatre, soaking pool, restaurant, and five \u2013 yes, five \u2013 bars including The Detention Bar. All McMenamins pubs and hotels serve beer brewed on the premises; the chain also makes its own liquors and wine from Oregon's superb grapes. And yes, they roast their own coffee. As with everything here, there's a casualness that hints at the region's rustic roots \u2013 formal dress is almost unheard of in the NW \u2013 but the exacting standards also bespeak the quiet intensity that has distinguished the area for generations. If you've got time, head south toward California. But keep the top down on your convertible until you make it to the border, so no one thinks you're showing off. Peter Mountford lives in Seattle.
