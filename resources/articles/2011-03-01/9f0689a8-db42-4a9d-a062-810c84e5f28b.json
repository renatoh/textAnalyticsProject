The horse's owner, the Greek shipping heiress Maria Niarchos, could barely disguise her joy. Sporting green shamrock glasses to celebrate St Patrick's Day, she said: 'That was excellent. I've never thought of having a winner at Cheltenham, but I'd follow Henry anywhere.' The winner was expertly partnered by freelance broadcaster Lorna Fowler, but eyebrows were raised by the whip action of another of the riders who appeared to strike their horse at least 10 times in the last furlong and a half. Flat spot Jockey Phillip Makin was one of a number of Flat jockeys to attend the Festival, but he perhaps went to greater lengths than most. Makin, the stable jockey to Kevin Ryan, attended Cheltenham on Wednesday afternoon but managed to make it across country to Kempton to ride a winner in the final race at 8.50. He was back in Gloucestershire on Thursday for the rest of the week though, while among his colleagues seen enjoying the action were Tom Queally, Ryan Moore, Paul Hanagan and Hayley Turner. Get Me Out Of Here Irish raiders bagged an unprecedented 13 successes at the Festival but the country's best-known owner was a conspicuous absentee from the scoreboard. JP McManus, whose name is synonymous with success at jumping's biggest meeting, had a blank Festival for the first year since 1993. McManus has had nearly 300 different horses running for him this season and was dealt a blow when the Champion Hurdle favourite Binocular had to be withdrawn from the race last weekend. McManus was at least knocking on the door through the week, notably when his handicap hurdler Get Me Out Here, who had a special preparation for the Festival, figured in a tense photo-finish after being the subject of a monster gamble in Friday's County Handicap Hurdle. The horse, ridden by Tony McCoy, looked certain to win until caught in the final stride and lost out by a nose, More memories for Lester Lester Piggott was another legendary Flat racing figure spotted at Cheltenham. Piggott was among the entourage in the winner's enclosure following the County Handicap Hurdle run in memory of the trainer he was most famously associated with, Vincent O'Brien. Lily of the Valley Singer-turned shopkeeper Lily Allen has been seduced by the charms of Fulham FC and the England cricket team already, but perhaps it will now be racing's turn after she spent Friday at Cheltenham. PR man Johnno Spence, Allen's host for the afternoon, tweeted: 'Had a great day's racing with Lily Allen and her fiance, Sam \u2013 she backed 4 winners and really enjoyed her day, what an awesome 4 days.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
