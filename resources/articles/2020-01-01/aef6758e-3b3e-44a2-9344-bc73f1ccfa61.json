Arsenal\u2019s improvement during Arteta\u2019s short time in charge is inescapable but, with the Champions League places still nine points away and the Europa League holding numerous potential banana skins, the competition may present their best chance of having something to show for their season. Their campaign begins at home to Leeds on Monday night and Arteta sees parallels with his time as a player at the Emirates, during which he captained Arsenal to a cup final win against Hull City in 2014 that laid to rest a nine-year trophy drought. \u201cWhen I arrived here, obviously we were trying to fight for the Premier League but we did not really have the level of compete and sustain it every year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the cups become very important and obviously this club has a massive history. But we\u2019d had [nine] years without winning absolutely anything. \u201cFor us, to lift that first FA Cup for this football club was like a massive relief that they tried to get this club again fighting to win some trophies and be there for everybody to see. It generated a really good belief and unity around our team and that helped that group of players to achieve what they achieved later when they won other cups.\u201d While that victory in 2014 did not quite open the floodgates it did, as Arteta referenced, pave the way for future successes in 2015 and 2017. Arsenal\u2019s long-term ambitions under their new head coach are loftier but he thinks the buzz of winning a major trophy would have lasting effects for his players\u2019 morale. \u201cI think winning brings togetherness and, when you have beautiful experiences together and you win trophies, then those experiences stay within that group,\u201d he said. \u201cYou like more the people that you work with, you believe more in them, you share some fantastic moments and that habit of winning, winning, winning \u2026 after you win, you don\u2019t want to stop winning. You become addicts to that and that\u2019s what we have to try to implement at this football club.\u201d Arteta said the very fact of a journey to Wembley alongside thousands of supporters \u201cgenerates something special\u201d and emphasised the need to create a connection between the team and a fanbase that has, in recent years, been lost. He suggested his goals for the club cannot be reached without that bond. \u201cNo, it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cImpossible. It\u2019s too powerful. With the fanbase we have, with our history and how much these people have been with this football and the great players they\u2019ve seen, the great teams they\u2019ve seen. If we get that connected, it\u2019s powerful. Without that, I think it\u2019s impossible.\u201d The atmosphere inside the Emirates had, in the games prior to Arteta\u2019s appointment in December, veered between toxicity and apathy. Upon his arrival he admitted it had taken him aback; the mood was far cheerier during the New Year\u2019s Day win over Manchester United, though, and he stressed that footballers \u2013 Arsenal\u2019s or their opponents\u2019 \u2013 will inevitably be affected by the mood in the stands. \u201cOf course it affects the players,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you prepare [for] a game against Arsenal, you know what the situation is of the opponent, then you have to play with those moments and use them in your favour. \u201cBut now when we know we have the fans behind us, we have to pinch our players to react them and make sure we get the fans behind us and use them to have a better performance and create more fear, as well, in the opponent.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
