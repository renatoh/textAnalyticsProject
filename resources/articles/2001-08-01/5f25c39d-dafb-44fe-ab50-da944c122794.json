I arrived in London on Tuesday - we always arrive the day before international games - and the other officials and I stayed in a fantastic place, Hampden Hall, where the England national team stayed in 1966. Our hosts, FA representatives who we know really well, took us to see Chicago, which was excellent. Then we dined at an Italian restaurant before getting a good night's sleep. We were up at 8am for breakfast in the garden and arrived at White Hart Lane for the security meeting at 9.30am. I inspected the pitch. As it was a premiership club, I expected it to be in good shape and sure enough everything was fine. At the security meeting, attended by the refs, FA representatives, England and Dutch team officials and the police, we discussed what colours the teams would wear, the warm-up, substitutions and general security issues. We then went on a sightseeing bus around London followed by a river cruise, and after more Italian food, we went back to Hampden Hall for a nap. We were at the stadium for 6.30pm. Kick off wasn't until 8pm but I had to make another pitch inspection while the fourth official checked the equipment in the dressing-room. Then I went out to warm up. Because the public was slow getting into the stadium, I was asked to kick-off 15 minutes late to avoid security problems. The atmosphere during the match was lovely. I've been in Britain many times and this was my third UK international friendly. I've been refereeing since 1978 (for Fifa since 1991) and the biggest game I've refereed was the Euro 2000 final. I don't like to compare different nationalities - to me all players are good and, if they don't have problems with me, I don't with them. At half time I gave my assistants a pep talk, encouraging them to keep up the concentration. After the game I took a shower in the ref's dressing room before having a beer in the executive box. Then it was off to a restaurant in Chinatown. We didn't get home until 2am, by which time we were rather tired. I was back home on Thursday, in plenty of time to make the referee fitness test at 6.30pm, together with my ref friends in the Gothenberg area. It involves a 12-minute run on the track, for a distance of at least 2,800m, then two 50m runs in under 7.5 seconds each and two 200m runs in under 32 seconds each."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
