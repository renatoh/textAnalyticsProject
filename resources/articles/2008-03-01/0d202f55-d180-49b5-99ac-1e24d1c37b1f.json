The pre-season odds on that sentence being written in the middle of March would have been dizzying, but it has been that kind of a spell for the striker. The headline statistic, of course, does not tell the full story. Drogba underwent surgery to a troublesome knee on December 8 and when he returned to action in January, after a substitute appearance in the FA Cup against QPR, it was time to lead Ivory Coast at the African Cup of Nations. It has been six weeks, though, since his return from Ghana and together with a handful of other African players, among them his Stamford Bridge team-mate Michael Essien, the hangover can be said to be clearing slowly. Drogba has looked a shadow of the player who terrorised defences last season with a tally of 33 goals in all competitions and as Avram Grant, the Chelsea manager, prepares for the Premier League run-in and the final stages of the Champions League, he is keen for the striker to begin firing again. The worry is that Drogba's mind is elsewhere. His loyalty to Jose Mourinho, Grant's predecessor and the manager who paid \u00a324m to Marseille for him in the summer of 2004, is well-documented. After the Portuguese's departure in September, Drogba said that something was \"broken with Chelsea\" and he vowed to leave. \"My decision is taken,\" he said. \"Nothing could keep me here now. I won't go back on this decision.\" Drogba has adopted a pragmatic attitude under Grant. The Israeli is in charge, he has the support of Roman Abramovich, the owner, and Grant is the man for whom he must play. Although he was foolishly sent off in his first match under Grant - the 0-0 Premier League draw with Fulham on September 29 - the 30-year-old has given his all and he remains determined to win the Champions League, the one gap on his CV at Chelsea. His professional pride burns fiercely. Yet the summer is sure to bring fresh conjecture about Drogba's future. He is eager to experience another football culture, in Spain or Italy, and he would welcome the prospect of linking up again with Mourinho, wherever he resurfaces. Drogba has resolved to keep his head down and work, but it remains to be seen whether he can raise himself to the very limits of his ability over the final nine weeks of the season. When Chelsea signed Nicolas Anelka from Bolton in January, for \u00a315m, there was excitement about what the France striker could do in tandem with Drogba. Anelka, a veteran of the ill-advised transfer, said that he would urge Drogba to stay but there has been little to discourage the sceptical view that Anelka has been bought to replace him, rather than partner him. Grant has still to play Anelka and Drogba together as a pair; indeed, they have only shared the field for one full match, the disastrous Carling Cup final defeat against Tottenham, when Anelka was shunted to the left in a 4-3-3, the formation to which Grant appears wedded. The Frenchman was unable to make any impression and has only scored two goals for the club so far, although Grant is unconcerned about the drought among his strikers. \"I'm not worried as long as the team are scoring goals,\" he said. \"It's a team that works. Anelka, when he played against West Ham and Derby, was like a team player and we won because of him. If he plays well and the team scores four or six goals, it's still good even if you do judge strikers by goals. \"I'm sure he and Didier will score goals. I wouldn't be happy if they played well but we lost 1-0. Our game is that we play with three forwards and the players behind come forward and provide goals. The team scores, not one player.\" Drogba, who had nine Chelsea goals for the season before his knee operation, scored his 10th against Tottenham at Wembley, a free-kick curled beyond the poorly positioned Paul Robinson. It is significant, though, that Grant must still field questions about Drogba's knee. The Ivorian damaged it on the eve of the Community Shield, once again at Aston Villa in early September and even after surgery, the club attributed his absence from the FA Cup defeat at Barnsley the weekend before last to knee trouble. \"In Africa, it was not easy,\" said Grant. \"I think all the players, except Salomon Kalou, from all the clubs, didn't come back the same because they played in 40-degree heat, a lot of humidity; they didn't train and the pitches weren't so good. But all of them are now better, including Didier.\" Drogba, however, has more to prove than most."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
