The Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs, Defra, has extended surveillance for the bluetongue virus to animals across the Midlands, from Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire to Bedfordshire as a second cow tested positive for the disease at the farm where the first UK case was confirmed in Suffolk on Saturday. The cow, at the Baylham House Rare Breeds Farm, near Ipswich, was slaughtered yesterday afternoon after the discovery by vets. Defra also said there was a continuing risk of foot and mouth in southern counties, from Essex and Kent across to Oxfordshire, as a seventh premises tested positive for the disease. In a statement last night, Defra said: \"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has now been confirmed at the site where it was decided that cattle should be slaughtered on suspicion earlier today. The site is within the existing Egham protection zone in Surrey and this becomes the seventh infected premises since August 3 this year.\" A temporary control zone was established around a possible new case in Hampshire yesterday, although officials said a separate suspected case on the Hampshire-West Sussex border was a false alarm. A report on the latest cases of foot and mouth said the animals were infected at the same time as the first outbreak. Debby Reynolds, the chief vet, said the cattle on the fifth infected premises, near Egham had foot and mouth lesions which were up to four weeks old and which had not been reported by the owner. The report said the animals were probably infected by \"mechanical transmission\" from the laboratory at Pirbright, or the first two infected farms. Meanwhile experts said it could take days or weeks before a bluetongue outbreak was confirmed or ruled out. Any further positive tests from animals in Suffolk need to be combined with weather data to determine whether they were bitten by a native midge or an insect from the continent. The latter would not not count as an outbreak. Vaccination remains the only proven way to protect animals, but a suitable vaccine has not yet been developed for the Suffolk strain. \"The one action that seems to work is bringing animals in at night, because the midges don't seem to like going into stables and sheds,\" said Matthew Baylis, an expert in bluetongue at Liverpool University."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
