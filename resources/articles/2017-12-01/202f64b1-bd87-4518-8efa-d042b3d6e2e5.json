By all accounts, the state has risen to the occasion. Black and white visitors who were given advance previews of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson, including many who were involved in the civil rights movement in the state, uniformly praised its candor and fairness. Then Donald Trump announced he would attend the grand opening on Saturday, which threw everything into a spin. Protests, boycotts and counter-events flourished. Many cited the president\u2019s comment in August that there were many \u201cfine people\u201d among white supremacists and neo-Nazis at a protest in Charlottesville, Virginia that left one counter-protester dead. Trump still came to Mississippi, although in the event he did not appear in public. In unusually cold weather, Jim Hood, Mississippi\u2019s Democratic attorney general, stood outside the museum. He said he had chosen not to accompany Trump\u2019s private tour, which was scheduled to last about 15 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s an untimely visit by the president,\u201d Hood said, adding that he wished the state\u2019s Republican governor, Phil Bryant, who invited Trump without informing anyone affiliated with the museum, \u201chad thought about the feelings of others\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is about,\u201d Hood said, \u201cunderstanding the feelings of others. As it is it\u2019s a subdued environment and a lot of people are not here.\u201d Hood said he chose not to accompany Trump because he did not \u201cthink he has much perspective on civil rights\u201d. He added: \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s not speaking. I\u2019m here to hear about civil rights history and his coming did throw cold water in the face of the people who fought those battles.\u201d Among those who boycotted the event, all of whom said they supported the museum but disapproved of Trump\u2019s presence, were US representative Bennie Thompson, Jackson mayor Chokwe Lumumba, former secretary of the navy and governor Ray Mabus, and US representative John Lewis. Another former governor, Haley Barbour, attributed his no-show to snow. A crowd of about 2,000 braved the chill. The temperature hovered around freezing, with a rare snowfall still on the ground. The crowd included a large contingent of security, media, volunteers, officials and state employees. There were many empty seats. There were speeches by state officials and there was also Myrlie Evers-Williams, whose husband Medgar Evers was assassinated in Jackson in 1963 and is the subject of an exhibition in the museum. Evers-Williams, who did accompany the Trump tour, described \u201cmy period of hatred of my native state\u201d and said she was initially dubious about the state\u2019s ability to truthfully chronicle its history. After touring the museum, she said: \u201cI believe in the state of my birth, and that is something I never thought I\u2019d say.\u201d She added: \u201cI wept.\u201d Evers-Williams did not mention Trump, though she noted: \u201cToday we are being challenged almost as much as when Medgar was alive. If Mississippi can rise to the occasion, then the rest of the country should be able to do the same.\u201d Former governor William Winter, who was instrumental in getting the museum and its sister Museum of Mississippi History built, also did not mention Trump. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through some very dark times but today I must tell you, I\u2019ve never been prouder to be a Mississippian.\u201d Bryant likewise praised the museums, and said he appreciated Trump\u2019s visit. \u2018Any other president than one supported by the KKK\u2019 The president spoke briefly inside the museum. In the crowd outside, some saw Trump\u2019s uncharacteristic decision not to speak publicly as telling. Stuart Rockoff, executive director of the Mississippi Humanities Council, said he suspected the decision had something to do with \u201cthat sign at the front that says the seats are reserved for civil rights veterans\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why he didn\u2019t speak \u2013 because the crowd would not have given him an enthusiastic reaction.\u201d That sentiment was echoed by Dita Aphrodite Kavyas, a civil rights attorney on the Mississippi Gulf coast and one of about 150 protesters who lined a nearby street. \u201cHe won\u2019t face a hostile crowd,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s afraid to stand in front of people who aren\u2019t yelling in support. But now he can put in a press release that he came.\u201d Talamieka Brice, who had organized protesters through her Pant Suit Nation Facebook page, said it was unfortunate Trump had become the focus of the event, which was planned to bring people together. \u201cIf it was any other president than one who is supported by the KKK, I\u2019d be fine with it,\u201d she said. As Brice spoke, a garbage truck passed. The driver honked and waved in apparent solidarity. Fears that violent protests would erupt proved unfounded. There was a lone pro-Trump protester, Shelby Reynor, who held a poster depicting the state flag, which bears the Confederate flag in its canton corner. \u201cI knew there would be anti-Trump people and I wanted to stand up,\u201d he said. There were no state flags flying around the museum site. Obvious Trump supporters were few among the mixed-race crowd. One man who declined to give his name noted that Trump had brought the housing and urban development secretary, who is African American. He said with a laugh: \u201cIf you\u2019re Donald Trump, what do you wear to a civil rights museum opening? Ben Carson!\u201d After the unseen president flew back to Florida, the predominately white crowd that accompanied the private tour emerged from the museum building. It included the official Miss Mississippi, a perfectly coiffed woman wearing a glittering tiara. Several people who were present for the Trump tour reported that he had said, in prepared remarks: \u201cMississippi is a state I love, where I\u2019ve had great success.\u201d Many who chose to forego the museum opening attended a separate event at the Smith Robertson Museum, which focuses on African American history in Jackson. Hood lamented their absence but said he had heard talk of holding another opening ceremony, without Trump \u201cand with all the civil rights people\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
