Bedding plants are generally selected for producing lots of flowers in a short period, and as such they are nearly all sun-lovers. Planted in the almost complete shade of my front garden, where their flower-producing powers are seriously diminished, they look pitiful. But most foliage houseplants (with the exception of cacti and succulents) originate from shaded rainforest floors, so as long as it is warm enough and there's no chance of a late frost, they should thrive in the fresh air, rainfall and shade of a north-facing spot outdoors. Ferns are the main contenders: choose between fishtail, button, hart's-tongue, Boston, rabbit's foot and Japanese painted. The leaves of fittonias, coleus, caladium, iresine and foliage begonias can provide colour. Combine with trailing plants such as ivies, creeping fig, tradescantia, creeping Jennie and Swedish ivy. The flowering plants that can cope with shade - namely busy lizzies and begonias - seem a different plant next to such leafy companions, certainly looking better than the usual eye-watering blocks of colour. The ferns in particular will have to be kept moist, but this is one of the hidden advantages of container gardening in the shade: your basket will take twice as long to dry out as those that hang in full sun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
