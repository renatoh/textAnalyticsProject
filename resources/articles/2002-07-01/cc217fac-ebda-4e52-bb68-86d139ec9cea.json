The education secretary made the comment at a conference for local education authority co-ordinators of the national literacy strategy. She said boys were still \"under-achieving massively\" in writing by the time they leave primary school. \"The biggest challenge is to continue to believe we can reach the kids we've not yet reached. We have to lead that because there will be people out in the nation, and teachers in some schools, that will give up on those children,\" she said. Last month, Ms Morris provoked anger from unions when she said there were some secondary schools that, as a teacher, she \"would not touch with a bargepole\". Today she suggested \"trying something different\" to help children lagging behind, particularly boys and ethnic minority pupils, especially those from Pakistani and Bangladeshi families. However, a spokeswoman for the National Union of Teachers said, although its members agreed there was a problem that needed to be dealt with, the government's strategy of setting targets to improve boys' reading did not help. \"Setting targets doesn't achieve anything,\" she said. We need a proper examination of what's going wrong.\" The spokeswoman explained that Ms Morris' claim that teachers were \"giving up\" on some pupils had been said before, but added: \"It would be helpful if she substantiated this claim instead of simply casting criticism. From inspection reports it's quite clear that teachers are working very hard to help kids from these particular backgrounds.\" To improve literacy across the board, the government introduced the national literacy strategy in 1998, and its numeracy counterpart, in 1999. In the three years since the first group of pupils to experience the literacy drive took national tests, the proportion of boys reaching the required standard in writing has increased from 47% to 50%. However, the proportion of girls hitting the mark has increased from 62% to 65%, meaning the gap between the sexes has remained the same."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
