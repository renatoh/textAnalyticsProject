The 22-year-old midfielder impressed during a two-month spell at Molineux in the season but the former Arsenal trainee returned to White Hart Lane at the end of the campaign. The Spurs coach Martin Jol chose not to offer the former England Under-20 player a new deal, however, and Glenn Hoddle, who handed Ricketts his debut at Spurs, will now open talks with him about a move to the Black Country. Brighton have been given the go-ahead to install 2,000 more seats at the Withdean Stadium. With their planned move to a new ground in the Falmer area ongoing, Albion are keen to increase capacity and the plan has been approved by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council. Stoke have confirmed that the loan players Michael Ricketts and Chris Clarke will not be returning to the club but are keen to tie up a deal with Southampton to sign Kenwyne Jones on a permanent basis. Hull, newly promoted to the Championship, have completed the signing of Stephen McPhee from the Portuguese side Beira Mar, splashing out \u00a3220,000 on the 23-year-old former Port Vale striker. McPhee, who was on the verge of a move to Leeds before opting to go abroad last season, has agreed a two-year deal at the KC Stadium. Bristol City's striker Lee Miller is the subject of a tug-of-war between Hearts and Aberdeen. Hearts have confirmed they have now had a \u00a3225,000 bid accepted but City have revealed that the Dons have also submitted an acceptable offer. Port Vale have been forced to wait at least seven days for the investment decision which could transform the club's future. The Vale chairman Bill Bratt has been speaking to a potential North American investor who is mulling over a decision to plough money into the club. Bratt intends to stand down from his unpaid post this summer after two years in the job. Swindon's manager Andy King is hoping to sign the Manchester United reserve full-back Paul Tierney on loan next season and has offered trials also to the former Bolton players Ricky Shakes and Charlie Comyn-Platt. Relegated Wrexham have agreed a two-year deal with the Sunderland goalkeeper Michael Ingham. The Northern Irishman had a loan spell at the Racecourse in the 2003-04 season but has played only twice for Sunderland's first team this past season. The Wycombe pair Mike Williamson and Matt Bloomfield have signed two-year contracts and the Forest Green striker Charlie Griffin has also agreed a move to the Causeway Stadium."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
