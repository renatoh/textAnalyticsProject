There are neither Christmas decorations in the bedrooms nor a Christmas tree inside the hotel. The suite has a kitchenette, so guests can be completely private and bring in treats to suit their tastebuds. The hotel, next to Knightsbridge's Beauchamp Place, is a luxurious home from home, providing comfort and tranquillity in a location that is just moments away from the hurly burly of the West End and only metres from Harvey Nicks and Harrod's food halls. With an exceptional staff-to-bedrooms ratio of 1:1, the hotel ensures a first-class service. Julia Spence"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
