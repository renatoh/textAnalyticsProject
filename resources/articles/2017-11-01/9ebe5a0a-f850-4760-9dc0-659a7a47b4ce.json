Recent polling suggests it will make a big impact in this month\u2019s Queensland state election. Seven polls since May 2017 have shown One Nation\u2019s vote between 15% and 18%, and last week\u2019s Galaxy poll put the party on 18%. Two polls at the beginning of this year predicted a vote of more than 20%. A vote of 18% would be quite high for a minor party, but our electoral system does not neatly translate votes into seats. There are a lot of factors that will influence how many seats One Nation could win if its vote is as high as polls suggest. One Nation\u2019s first electoral test came in the 1998 Queensland election, as a prelude to the federal election that year. The party polled 22.7% of the vote, overtaking the separate Liberal and National parties to come second. The two Coalition parties collectively polled 31%, while Labor managed almost 39%. With this vote, One Nation came in the top two in 33 out of 89 state electorates, but managed to win only in 11. It tended to do well in regional areas, but not so well in Brisbane. Its strongest areas encompassed all the seats in the Ipswich area, as well as large rural electorates up the coast and further inland. It also did quite well in smaller coastal towns, but not in Cairns and Townsville. It won seats off Labor and the Nationals. The party\u2019s candidates defeated six MPs of Labor and five from the National party. Of the 33 seats where it came in the top two, 20 of those contests were against Labor. This showed Labor had polled much higher than the conservative parties. A lot has changed since 1998. The former Coalition parties have merged, the voting system has changed, and One Nation, which was dormant for more than a decade, is a lot more active now. We can\u2019t use recent state election results to judge where One Nation might perform best \u2013 the party ran only 11 candidates at the last state election, and polled less than 1% of the vote. But it did manage more than 9% of the statewide vote in the Senate at last year\u2019s federal election. This data has been broken down at the state electoral level by Alex Jago, and gives us a sense of the places where One Nation would be expected to do best. The pattern is similar to what we saw in 1998: urban fringe, small regional towns and large rural electorates, on the coast and inland. The party\u2019s vote was highest in the Ipswich fringe seat of Lockyer, where Hanson came close to victory at the 2015 state election. One Nation does slightly better in Liberal National party seats, but is still a threat in several Labor seats in places such as Townsville and Ipswich. If One Nation polls as high as 18%, it will come in the top two, on primary votes, in many seats \u2013 but that won\u2019t be enough to win seats. In most places, the party will not be in a position to win on primary votes, and will require preferences from other candidates. The preference system has changed since the last election \u2013 voters will now be required to number every box. This means more preferences will play a role in deciding the result. It will also make it easier for a candidate in second place to catch up on a rival. Labor and the Greens have declared they will not give preferences to One Nation. The LNP plans to give preferences to One Nation over Labor in at least 50 seats (out of the 61 seats where One Nation is standing). Katter\u2019s Australian party may poll a substantial number of votes in some north Queensland seats, and those may be crucial in a seat\u2019s result. While parties recommend preferences, their voters are free to reject that recommendation \u2013 many Labor voters chose to preference One Nation in 2016, despite Labor\u2019s preference recommendation suggesting otherwise. One Nation will struggle to secure seats off the LNP without Labor and Greens preferences \u2013 so it would probably need a primary vote lead to win such a contest. Where the party is competing with Labor, LNP preferences will play a big role in deciding the result \u2013 and One Nation\u2019s prospects have been improved by Friday\u2019s announcement that the LNP will give them preferences in most of their contests. The rise of One Nation will generally increase the complexity and unpredictability in this election. A more fragmented political system will result in candidates being elected with fewer primary votes, relying more on preferences. If One Nation can win a handful of seats, it will also increase the chance of a hung parliament. It is possible One Nation will not be able to keep up its current levels of polling. The party suffered under the pressure of an election campaign in Western Australia this year, and ended up polling about 8% in the upper house, comparedwith well over 10% earlier in the campaign. A drop of even a few percentage points would make it much harder for it to win seats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
