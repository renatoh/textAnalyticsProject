No 10 announced it would fulfil two key campaign aims of the late former Labour cabinet minister, including a national rollout of a brain cancer diagnosis test, gold standard dye, used to identify tumours. The method is only used in half of brain cancer centres in England. \u201cIt must be extended to all of them,\u201d Jowell said in her final speech in the House of Lords. Theresa May and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, also announced an annual Tessa Jowell global symposium, which will host the best clinical, scientific and academic minds on brain cancer to to identify gaps, best practice and research priorities. Downing Street said it hoped the first symposium would take place by the end of the year. The work to fulfil the commitments will be led by health minister Lord O\u2019Shaughnessy. \u201cMy aim is to boost research into treatments \u2013 even cures \u2013 for brain cancer and transform care for patients in the way that Tessa called for,\u201d he said. Jowell met May and Hunt in Downing Street in February where they unveiled a new \u00a345m brain cancer research fund, with new government funding of \u00a320m over five years. That has now been doubled with more new money to \u00a340m, which will bring the total research fund to \u00a365m, including \u00a325m from Cancer Research UK and \u00a313m of regular funding. The government also said it would commit to accelerate the use of adaptive trials \u2013 another key ask by Jowell during her House of Lords speech. \u201cNew adaptive trials can test many treatments at the same time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey speed up the process and save a lot of money.\u201d Traditional clinical trials test only one drug or treatment at a time and can take several years to produce results, whereas adaptive trials allow researchers to test new drugs or combinations of therapies in response to a patient\u2019s condition. May said she had been privileged to host Jowell at Downing Street to speak about her illness. \u201cI hope that the actions we are taking now and in the future to improve care and research for those confronting a terrible disease will form part of the lasting legacy of an inspirational woman,\u201d she said. Hunt said he had been \u201cmoved by her bravery and selfless campaigning in her final months, and determined to honour her life and memory with the action on brain cancer that she fought so hard for\u201d. About 11,400 people are diagnosed with a brain tumour every year in the UK, with survival rates of just 14% for 10 years or more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
