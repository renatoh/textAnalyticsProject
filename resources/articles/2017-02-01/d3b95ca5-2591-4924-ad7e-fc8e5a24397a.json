The controversy has provoked a strong range of opinions on social media. At one end of the spectrum, there were those who thought Bouzanis\u2019 alleged comment was of no consequence, while at the other end, many expressed the view that Football Federation Australia should throw the book at Bouzanis. Whether we like to admit it or not, discrimination is a fact of life in all spheres of life. This incident is a reflection of society in general. The bigger picture is that some good can come out of this sorry situation, if FFA and Melbourne City show the maturity, courage and authenticity that was missing, for example, in the inadequate manner the AFL handled allegations of racism directed at the Indigenous Australian rules football champion, Adam Goodes. Whenever an incident of this nature occurs, the default reflex of the accused player\u2019s football club and supporters, is to circle the wagons around the accused, especially if it is a star player. The club and some supporters will seek to deny or minimise allegations of discrimination. Some even revert to attacking the alleged victim. Luis Su\u00e1rez and John Terry are cases in point in the world of football. FFA has a process for dealing with allegations of racial, ethnic, religious or sex discrimination, with the weekend matter likely to be referred for mediation under FFA\u2019s discrimination policy. After the mediation process is concluded under the policy, Bouzanis may be charged under Clause 9 of FFA\u2019s disciplinary regulations. Bouzanis is possibly facing a minimum five-match sanction, if the match review panel finds Bouzanis has a case to answer, and the disciplinary committee finds the relevant offence(s) have been committed. Melbourne City deserve praise for the swift and principled manner the club has dealt with the issue so far, with a statement expressing genuine regret about the incident. Bouzanis in the club statement admitted making the discriminatory remarks out of ignorance, however, City stated that Bouzanis \u201chas since understood the seriousness of his comments\u201d. This isn\u2019t about Dean Bouzanis per se. The level of ignorance, gauging from the reaction to this incident, and from past incidents in football and other sports involving racism or any form of discrimination, extends way beyond one goalkeeper or player. If Bouzanis is found guilty, the sanction should be strong and proportionate. This is an area where clubs and sports governing bodies often failed to live up to their rhetoric of zero tolerance for discrimination in sport. It took AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan almost a year to admit racial taunts aimed at Adam Goodes at stadiums around the country had racial overtones. We also witnessed Liverpool\u2019s farcical T-shirt defence of Su\u00e1rez who was accused of racially vilifying Patrice Evra. To add insult to injury, both Evra and Su\u00e1rez suffered vicious personal attacks from fans. In rugby union, England Prop Joe Marler was found guilty of misconduct, fined \u00a320,000 and banned for two matches after he called an opponent \u201cgypsy boy\u201d during a Six Nations match at Twickenham in 2016. Marler had initially not been cited by the Six Nations who said Marler had apologised and that the words were said \u201cin heat of the moment\u201d. But for the intervention of World Rugby, who brought brought a misconduct charge after investigating the incident, Marler would have escaped sanction. At the same time, this is a big opportunity to harness the power of sport to promote non-discrimination, diversity and the principle of inclusivity. This was the opportunity that was missed with the Marler and Su\u00e1rez cases. It is an opportunity to educate the ignorant \u2013 many of whom think Bouzanis\u2019 alleged racial slur was of no consequence \u2013 in addition to sending a strong message that discrimination, not only in sport, but in society in general is unacceptable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
