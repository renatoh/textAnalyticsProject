The rest of February consists of a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Blackpool or Norwich, the resumption of their Champions League campaign at Porto, and the Carling Cup final with Arsenal. By the time the champions resume their quest to win a hat-trick of titles at Portsmouth on 3 March, they could well be 12 points behind Manchester United. Middlesbrough were the only club to have beaten Chelsea twice in the Premiership since Jose Mourinho's arrival in the summer of 2004. Both those results came at the Riverside - including a 2-1 win on the second day of this season. While Chelsea will hope a new fragility peaked during January, Gareth Southgate's rookie season has gradually become more impressive. His team arrived in west London undefeated in 2007, having collected 11 from the 15 available points and scoring 12 times. But Southgate's prospects of becoming the first manager to win in the Premiership here since Arsene Wenger on 21 February 2004 were weakened by the absence of Jonathan Woodgate, who watched from the bench. Mourinho, of course, is suffering the worst injury spate of his term. To notable absentees Joe Cole and Ashley Cole Michael Ballack was added, injured for Germany in midweek. And the Portuguese coach was also forced to select Paulo Ferreira - hardly his favourite defender - in place of Ricardo Carvalho, who did not make the 16. At least John Terry was back for a first start since the 1-0 win at Newcastle on 13 December. And the skipper would have been pleased with a beginning from his team that was dangerous, yet frustrating. Three times during the opening 10 minutes, Chelsea should have scored. Two of those chances fell to Drogba. And if he had converted the first from the edge of the area on five minutes, it would have been a stunning end to a slick move that involved Frank Lampard's neat in and out with Lassana Diarra, before the England international found Drogba with a delicious pass with the outer edge of his right boot. A major talking point came 11 minutes from the break. Southgate rose to complain about a decision Chris Foy had not given. Over came Mourinho to place an arm on the manager and tell him to sit down. Southgate's umbrage at vintage Mourinho behaviour was returned with requisite interest and the former England defender reached for the industrial language. That eventually calmed down. But Middlesbrough then finished the half poorly. Following a prolonged delay, Drogba's low free-kick from 20 yards out beat Mark Schwarzer. It was a deserved lead, but it should have been greater for the hosts. Within three minutes of the restart, it nearly was. Andriy Shevchenko - pivotal to all intrigue at the Bridge this season - produced a glancing header from a corner that was cleared on the line by Julio Arca. The Ukrainian's afternoon, though, was that one moment of promise hampered by a tentativeness that has become the 30-year-old's leitmotif. As the hour mark approached, the game had become all Chelsea. Yakubu Ayegbeni's skill took out Ferreira and Claude Makelele easily, but his skied effort from the area's angle left him furious and was the visitor's last true attack. Abel Xavier was a touch more unhappy five minutes later, though. Arjen Robben, with his first action since replacing Diarra, cut in from the right. Possession was returned by Salomon Kalou to the Dutchman. His cross - as against Wigan last month when Chris Kirkland was the unfortunate player - was turned in by an opponent, leaving culprit Xavier to begin his curses. Drogba made it 17 in the Premiership this campaign with a second accurate free-kick in the 83rd-minute. From a diagonal angle on the left, the striker's effort deflected beyond Schwarzer off Andrew Davies. Man of the match: Didier Drogba Frank Lampard was supremely effective. But the Ivory Coast striker now has 25 goals in all competitions and might just have edged ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo as this season's supreme player. Now scores far more than he misses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
