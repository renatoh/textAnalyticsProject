It is likely to be worth about \u00a32,500 a year. The scheme draws on the lessons of the pupil premium for children on free schools meals in schools, and is designed to give children from poor families a guarantee that if they make it to university they will be financially supported by the state. Ministers insist this is not a simple rebranding of existing help, and the guarantee to poor students represents a re-engineering of the currently haphazard system that will boost aspiration. The idea is part of a new social mobility review due to be published on Tuesday which is billed as central to Clegg's political thinking. Clegg's decision to sanction the trebling of student fees led to a major backbench revolt and has soured his relationship with large parts of the electorate. In the midst of the furore , which was in breach of a manifesto promise, Clegg made passing reference to a student premium, but it was thought the idea was a panic-stricken response to the political crisis, and was not subsequently developed. Liberal Democrat thinking is that children even at primary school age are thinking about their future education, and by providing an earlier guarantee of funding, the aspiration of poorer students will be boosted. A lack of aspiration is seen as one of the biggest barriers to poor children going on to higher education. The aim will be to guarantee the student premium to any secondary school child on free school meals who passes the English baccalaureate and secures an offer of a place at university. Students would know at least two years before applying to university that money would be available to help them so long as they attain certain grades and the money could come in the form of a fee waiver or a bursary. The baccalaureate is given to pupils who have secured a C grade or better across a core of academic subjects \u2013 English, mathematics, history or geography, the sciences and a language. The social mobility paper will for the first time publish figures showing the disparity in performance between state and independent children at A-level. Across the 2010-11 year group, 7% of state school students achieved two As and a B, compared to 23.1% among their counterparts in the independent sector. Two years before, the gap was even wider with only 5.8% of state school pupils getting AAB compared to 22.3% at independent schools. Clegg will outline efforts to narrow that gap. \"Education is critical to our hopes of a fairer society. Right now there is a great rift in our education system between our best schools, most of which are private, and the schools ordinary families rely on. That is corrosive for our society and damaging to our economy, \" he intends to say. \"I don't for a moment denigrate the decision of any parent to do their best for their child, and to choose the best school for them. Indeed, that aspiration on behalf of children is one of the most precious ingredients of parenthood. \"But we do need to ensure that our school system as a whole promotes fairness and mobility, that heals the rift in opportunities.\" As part of the trebling of the cap on university fees to \u00a39,000, ministers reinforced a range of measures to reduce the cost of going to university for poor students such as reducing or minimising the cost of loan repayment. The national scholarship programme worth \u00a3100m this year is due to rise to \u00a3150m by 2014-15, with matched funding pound for pound from universities aimed at helping mainly new students . This cash is available to students whose parents' income is below \u00a325,000 and assuming matched funding can be worth up to \u00a36,000. Separately the higher funding education council for England provides up to \u00a3150m to help disadvantaged children, but often students do not know the size of the grant they will receive until they arrive at university. A government source said; \"There is quite a lot of funding available in the system, but it is not available until very late on so we want children and families to get earlier line of sight of what is on offer and to guarantee it\". The social mobility white paper \u2013 a review of progress on a similar paper a year ago \u2013 may also push the boundaries of the thorny debate on the extent to which universities can take account of background in deciding on allocation of places. The issue led to an attempt by Conservatives to block the appointment of Les Ebdon to be director of the Office for Fair Access. The higher education minister David Willetts has stressed universities must be autonomous bodies even though their ability to charge higher fees is subject to an agreement to provide fair access arrangements for poorer students. Willetts has also said grades need not be the only indicator, suggesting admission \"can be based on more than just A-level results, by looking at all the information that indicates the potential of an individual to succeed.\" That can include their relative performance at school. A survey by SPA (the supporting professionalism in admissions programme) last year showed that almost a quarter of universities were planning to offer lower grades to 2012 applicants from poor schools or deprived backgrounds. The social mobility paper will have to face the challenge that the government will not meet the child poverty target, a target of relative inequality by the proposed deadline of 2020. Ministers are looking at a range of additional life chance targets, such as birth weight and parenting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
