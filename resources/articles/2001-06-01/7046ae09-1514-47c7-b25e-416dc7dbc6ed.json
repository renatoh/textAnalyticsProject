The Lions rediscovered their winning ways with a 41-24 victory over the New South Wales Waratahs, but the game will be remembered for reasons other than the quality, or otherwise, of the rugby. And the verbal belligerence that has characterised the Australian approach to the tour has now been adopted by the tourists themselves. Lions coach Graham Henry was seething with fury after the match, describing it as a 'black day' for the sport, and tour manager Donal Lenihan labelled the extraordinary barrage of punches that New South Wales full-back Duncan launched on prostrate Lions fly-half Ronan O'Gara 'a disgrace'. O'Gara, on as a replacement for Will Greenwood, required eight stitches to a wound beneath his eye and McRae received a red card with which few could quibble. New South Wales coach Bob Dwyer, encouragingly, did not condone McRae's actions, but, when advised of Henry's anger at the Waratah's approach to the game, he pointed out that, as a New Zealander, Henry would always look to blame the opposition when things went wrong. In addition to the sending off, four players, two from each side, were subsequently sin-binned after a brawl to reduce the number of players on the field to 25. 'If the Lions hadn't had the discipline,' said Henry afterwards, 'it could have got very, very serious. It was a black day for the game of rugby down here. I think there has been an agenda by the Australian media to create some impression about the Lions.' Lenihan also picked up on the treatment that his players had been receiving on and off the field in Australia. 'If one of our players did that,' he said of the McRae's flurry of punches, 'then we would soon see what the headlines would be in Australia. If the shoe was on the other foot, then we would be reading about it for the next 12 years.' And Austin Healey has also hit out in his column for The Observer today. 'That game was sick. And what McRae did was plain cowardly.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
