The Arsenal manager had already said he was \"more likely\" to strengthen his squad when the mid-season transfer window opened, after Cesc F\u00e1bregas's knee injury which will sideline the central midfielder for four months, but he has addressed the subject of the Zenit St Petersburg playmaker for the first time. \"I don't need to announce a name,\" Wenger said with a smile when asked by the French television channel Canal Plus about Arshavin, \"because when you do that there is 50% less chance of making the signing. But I need a creative midfielder and eventually another midfielder, because we are short.\" Wenger has seen a clutch of midfielders depart the club in the past 12 months \u2014 Lassana Diarra left for Portsmouth last January before moving on to Real Madrid, and Mathieu Flamini, Alex Hleb and Gilberto Silva went in the summer \u2014 and although he signed Samir Nasri and Aaron Ramsey his ambitions have been undermined by the injuries to F\u00e1bregas, Theo Walcott and Tomas Rosicky. Walcott is out until the middle of February after shoulder surgery and there are fears that Rosicky will not play again this season because of his long-standing hamstring tendon problem. \"The transfer window opens [on Thursday] and, although we are not close to signing anyone at the moment, if we do buy I think what we need is maybe someone with a bit of experience,\" Wenger wrote in his programme notes for the visit of Portsmouth. \"We already have many young players so, if we buy, it will be somebody who is ready to play straight away. A loan deal could also be a possibility. \"Cesc is a long way from playing again, so are Tomas Rosicky and Theo Walcott, and these are three creative players that we count on at the start of the season. So what we might need is someone who can create a little spark.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
