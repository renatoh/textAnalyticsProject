The huge spike in Afghans crossing the porous border from Iran, in one of the biggest cross-border movements of the pandemic, has led to mounting fears in the humanitarian community over the potential impact of new infections carried from Iran, one of the countries worst affected by the virus. With the Afghan ministry of health warning that some 16 million people could become infected and tens of thousands could die, experts say the wave of returning labourers and refugees, who are then dispersing throughout the country, is threatening an already complex health and security situation. According to a joint situation report from the World Health Organization and the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs at the weekend, while only 174 Afghans are confirmed to have the virus, the real number may be much higher because of limited ability to test and trace contacts. For its part, the Norwegian Refugee Council warned at the end of March that \u201cgiven the prevalence of Covid-19 in Iran, [the] humanitarian community\u2019s main focus now is on provinces and districts that are considered to be at highest risk due to the volume of cross-border movement. \u201cThis includes 25 districts that are the primary destinations for returnees from Iran, with Herat, Nimroz, Kabul, Balkh, Faryab being at the highest risk due to their greater connectivity to outbreak provinces in Iran.\u201d Underlining the concerns is the fact that the majority of confirmed cases are located in the western Herat province bordering Iran, a transit point for many of those crossing. At a camp on the outskirts of Herat, the Guardian met recent returnees from Iran who explained that they had fled Iran both because of fear of the virus and because the lockdown there had put them out of work. Among them was Mirwais, 18, from Baghlan province, who had been working as a labourer for two years. \u201cThe situation was getting worse everyday. Because of the quarantine I couldn\u2019t work any more. Secondly, I was afraid of coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe border was so busy. Everyone was scared of the virus. I put up with so many humiliations in Iran to send money home. But I couldn\u2019t resist coronavirus because I\u2019m the only one who works in my family and if I die, they would die too, of hunger. \u201cNow I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know whether to go home penniless or stay here. I had just enough money to get to the border.\u201d Zainullah, 24, from Ghazni province, who had been employed in a workshop making chairs, told a similar story. \u201cMost of my relatives left Iran due to coronavirus in last month. My parents insisted I come back. I did not want to return. I need 400,000 Afghanis (\u00a34,213) to get married. I paid half of them to my fiance\u2019s father and now he wants another half. \u201cCoronavirus has destroyed my life. I have no idea what to do next.\u201d Gul Ahmad, 43, said another factor was the lack of healthcare for Afghan workers as Iranian doctors were preoccupied with caring for Iranians. \u201cWe could not go to doctors for a very simple reason. Iranians were busy with treating their own people, they won\u2019t give a damn for a sick Afghan.\u201d Eynoddin Aslami, head of the camp, said record numbers of Afghans had been arriving. \u201cFor a month there were more than 13,000 people crossing the border every day although that has decreased to around 3,000 a day. \u201cWe are all concerned here. We are so worried about the current situation. We encounter hundreds of new arrivals every day. \u201cWe try our best to stay away from them, but it is impossible. And some may be infected.\u201d Dan Tyler of the Norwegian Refugee Council echoed the concerns of many, saying: \u201cThere has been a massive spike in the number of spontaneous returns. There\u2019s already a lockdown in Herat and around Kabul and Kandahar, and we\u2019re really concerned about the humanitarian impact. It\u2019s already challenging. The border on the Pakistan side is closed and we are expecting more measures. \u201cSupply lines are chocking up which is a real concern in a country on the brink of famine. On top of that there is the issue of the Taliban and other armed groups allowing access in areas that are not accessible, which underlines the talk there has been around a [global] corona ceasefire.\u201d Earlier this month Joel Millman, of the International Organization for Migration, which has been tracking the returns from Iran, warned of the danger of widespread transiting via unofficial border crossings. \u201cThis is particularly dangerous in a public health emergency, because \u2026 no one is able to check your health conditions or your documents, or know where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
