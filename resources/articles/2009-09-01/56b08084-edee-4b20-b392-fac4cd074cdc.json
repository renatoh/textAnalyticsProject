It is also likely that few victims pause to wonder where these kids came from. Romanian journalist Liviu Tipurita is extremely interested, however, and the result is an absorbing and depressing journey among Europe's untouchables. Shooting Stars 10pm, BBC2 What the returning Shooting Stars lacks in novelty, it makes up for in undiminished surrealism. Tonight's guests include Ricky Wilson from the Kaiser Chiefs and Jack Dee (\"Your face is like an abandoned walnut. Like a doomed horse\"), but it's the enduring madness of the hosts that entertains. Within mere moments, Vic has arrested a jazz pancake and shot it with a clarinet. Even regulars Ulrika Jonsson and drumming baby George Dawes (Matt Lucas) look surprised. The Office: An American Workplace 10pm, Comedy Central Another quiet Wednesday on the non-terrestrial channels is saved by NBC's reliably funny US version of The Office. If you had your interest piqued by the UK Office marathon on BBC2 on Sunday, then you'll find plenty to love here. This week, after a flasher exposes himself to Meredith, Michael takes the office's womenfolk to the mall as part of a \"women's appreciation\" day. He ends up opening his heart about his relationship with Jan, before treating them all to one item each from Victoria's Secret. And, with the women gone, the men use the opportunity to discover the hidden mysteries of the ladies' loos. The Muslim Tommies 11.25pm, BBC1 In July 2006, Lance Corporal Jabron Hashmi of the Royal Signals Regiment was killed by a Taliban rocket attack in Helmand province. The Peshawar-born 24-year-old was the first Muslim to die in British uniform in the present war in Afghanistan, and was eulogised as if he were a novelty. As this film reminds us, however, Muslims have been fighting for Britain for centuries. Mishal Husain narrates a too-often ignored history of servicemen who have rejected the idea that observance of their faith and service to their country are necessarily irreconcilable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
