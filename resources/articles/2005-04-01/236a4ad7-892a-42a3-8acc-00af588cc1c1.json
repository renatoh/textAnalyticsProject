Here are five ways of releasing your inner designer on a sensible budget: 1 Think Scandinavia Make like Danish lighting designer Poul Henningsen (celebrated for his classic PH Lamps, just so you know) with a Knappa pendant lamp from Ikea. Henningsen's artichoke light will set you back upwards of \u00a33,500 from trendy London store Skandium. With Knappa, you'll hardly notice the difference and it's only \u00a312.50 from Ikea. 2 Think fashion One of the biggest trends has been fashion designers entering homeware: Zandra Rhodes crockery; Vera Wang tableware from John Lewis; decorative glasses from Kenzo. But for the very best, try anything by Italian fashion house Missoni. A Jennifer tableware dinner plate will set you back \u00a314.50. You're getting a designer name at a distinctly undesigner price. 3 Chandeliers Their popularity is undimmed among the design elite, but they're now available from every retailer worth its salt. Matalan's Regency chandelier, \u00a320, is particularly gorgeous and is flying off the shelves. 4 Statement wallpaper See chandeliers, above. The likes of Cole and Son or Brunschwig &amp; Fils may be selling elegant, flocked wallpaper to the monied shoppers of Knightsbridge, but you can get fabulous lookalike patterns easily. Try John Lewis or Farrow &amp; Ball. Or go mad in Cole and Son and paper the downstairs loo. 5 Salvage Reclamation yards are currently the last word in designer cool. But vintage furniture doesn't come cheap. So try reupholstering your tatty pieces in smart designer fabric. If it's good enough for Paul Smith, it's good enough for you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
