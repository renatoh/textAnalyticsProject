According to a survey of under-10s released today, \"money and getting rich\" is the top priority for the nation's children. However, parents will be reassured that young people are unlikely to fritter away their cash. When asked what they thought were the worst things in the world, children voted drunk people and smoking top. Other forms of anti-social behaviour - litter and graffiti - were voted third and fourth respectively, with shopping voted the eighth worst thing in the world. Other top priorities for children include football, pop music and animals, all of which made the top five in the poll of \"best things in the world\". Ranked second was being famous, last year's winner. But when asked who the world's most famous people actually were, children came up with an unlikely mix. God came first in the fame list, gaining just enough votes to beat Wayne Rooney, Jesus and David Beckham. The Queen was voted fifth most famous in the world, followed by Harry Potter, Beyonce, Father Christmas, Robbie Williams and Simon Cowell. The survey also found that 72% thought they would marry when they grow up, although almost a quarter answered with a definite no. Asked what they would ban if they had unrivalled power, children voted \"telling lies\" number one, followed closely by getting drunk, fighting and drugs. The online questionnaire, organised by sponsors of National Kids Day, Luton First, was carried out with schools' cooperation. Make me rich and famous...
