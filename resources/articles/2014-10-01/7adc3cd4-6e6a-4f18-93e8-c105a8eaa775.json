Even for Shepparton, a tiny town 180km north of Melbourne, this was unusual. Briggs didn\u2019t know then that the guy was on drugs, but it was a 40 degree day and the man was lying in the blazing sun. \u201cAh man, look at that dude,\u201d said Briggs from the passenger seat. \u201cYup,\u201d said his friend. They kept driving. Briggs kept looking back. \u201cYou gotta turn around,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cTurn around. If somebody drove past me, man, I\u2019d be upset.\u201d His friend shrugged and did a U-turn. They pulled to a stop at the kerb, and Briggs hopped out of the car. \u201cYou all right?\u201d he said to the man, who did nothing but groan in response and begin seizing. Briggs pulled out his phone. \u201cWhen the paramedics arrived,\u201d he says, \u201cit turns out they knew him on a first-name basis. \u2018You again! You\u2019ve had too much heroin! You need to get off that stuff\u2019.\u201d Briggs laughs as he recalls the incident, which took place last year. He\u2019s a rapper, gifted at telling stories, and this is no exception. \u201cThat\u2019s Shepparton,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like that friend you have, and you don\u2019t really know why you\u2019re friends with him, but you are. You\u2019ve grown up together. If this friend comes around and asks to borrow your stereo, you probably know it\u2019ll be broken when it comes back.\u201d Most Australian rappers don\u2019t come from small towns. They come from Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth. And no matter which way you look at it, Aussie rap is dominated by white males. But Briggs bucks that trend. Shepparton is tiny, with a population of just over 60,000. Among its main employers is the SPC Ardmona canning factory. The town also has a large population of Indigenous Australians and Briggs is one of them, with his tribe Yorta Yorta tattooed on his arm. His new album, Sheplife, busts open the myths of small-town Australia, to show that spots like Shepparton have good sides and bad; they can hold drug addicts and people prepared to help them (even if they\u2019ve done it a dozen times before). The fact that the album is so good musically doesn\u2019t hurt either, with its heavy beats and uncompromising verses. Briggs is now showcasing it on a national tour and it\u2019s no surprise that he\u2019s looking forward to performing in his hometown, even less that he\u2019s more than familiar with the venue, \u201can alternative little hole in the ground\u201d called the Yahoo bar. \u201cI\u2019ve been banned from there, been kicked out for being too young,\u201d Briggs says. \u201cI used to work there as a security guard. I think at one stage me and my mates were all banned, which was good, because it\u2019s better to be banned in a group.\u201d Briggs has toured internationally with his label mates the Hilltop Hoods and collaborated with artists ranging from the local megastar Gurrumul to the hardcore New York rapper Ill Bill. He\u2019s one of only a few Indigenous hip-hop artists, alongside Jimblah, t4he Last Kinection and Philly, who have seen any real success. When asked why, Briggs chooses his words with care. \u201cA lot of guys can\u2019t get their stuff together, because it\u2019s a lot of work to put in to become an artist,\u201d he says. \u201cI know a lot of Indigenous rappers, but Australian hip-hop isn\u2019t something a lot of them want to enter, because it\u2019s perceived as white, and they don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a place for their voice.\u201d Another perspective comes from Toby Finlayson, director of the charitable organisation Desert Pea Media. For the past few years the company has been travelling to remote Indigenous communities, using hip-hop as a tool for them to tell their stories. Desert Pea put out a compilation of songs from these excursions, entitled Song Nation Vol 1, in July. \u201cIt\u2019s only 200 years ago that our government tried to wipe Aboriginal people off the face of the country,\u201d says Finlayson. \u201cWe tried to eliminate their culture and language. That\u2019s got repercussions \u2013 you have people growing up without a sense of traditional culture, and therefore identity. \u201cIn places like the US, you\u2019ve got quite a big African American population, whereas here, only 3% of the population are Aboriginal. [But] there are some really amazing Indigenous artists coming out now. People are ready for hip-hop with a voice that isn\u2019t middle-class, white Australian.\u201d While Sheplife might be about his hometown, there\u2019s a deeper purpose to Briggs\u2019 music. \u201cI\u2019m trying to champion the fact that [Aboriginal] voices are relevant everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to drive home. It\u2019s not about white rappers or Aboriginal rappers. It\u2019s about good and bad rappers.\u201d \u2022 Briggs is at Mojo\u2019s Fremantle on 10 October, touring nationwide until 3 November This article was corrected on Tuesday 14 October. Briggs\u2019 tribe was wrongly cited. The artist Koolism was also wrongly listed as an Indigenous artist."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
