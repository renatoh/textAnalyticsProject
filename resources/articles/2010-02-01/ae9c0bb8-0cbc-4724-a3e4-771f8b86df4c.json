My new boyfriend has an awful lot of money for someone who just works in the off licence up the road. Which is lovely, because he takes me out for very expensive meals and on lovely skiing holidays, buys \u00a3300 bottles of champagne. But still, I'd like to know where it comes from. He's an MI5 agent, he tells me, but I should keep it to myself. After that he takes me to work with him, we drive around Oxford at night, doing undercover surveillance. It turns out, as it happens, that the jewellers shop where I work has been targeted by a gang of dangerous international criminals, but he's on to them. Then, suddenly I'm the target, the baddies want to kidnap me, lock me in a cellar: I'm in a lot of danger. He has to open all my post for me, in case it's full of anthrax ... Yeah, I probably would have fallen for it, to be honest. Mainly because I would have wanted to believe it. Who wouldn't want to suddenly be in Spooks, but for real? This is what happened to Leanne McCarthy. But she wasn't in Spooks, she was in Would I Lie to You? And Leanne's boyfriend would, big time. Not only did Wayne Gouveia tell her a pack of lies about who he was, he also stole \u00a314,000 from her. That's why he wouldn't let her open her mail \u2013 nothing to do with anthrax, everything to do with the fact that it was all final demands for the repayment of loans he'd taken out in her name. To be fair to Wayne, he did spend pretty much all the money on her and her family, says he did it to show how much he loved her. Does that make it any better? I think so, but the judge didn't agree, and sent him down. He's out soon, though. So if the guy at Oddbins comes over all Jack Bauer on you be careful, it may be Wayne. He's done it before, too; he told another of his victims he was a Formula One racing driver. You'd think she might have Googled him, just to check. Extraordinary, all of it, and fascinating."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
