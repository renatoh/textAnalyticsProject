This result, against a Liverpool team stumbling towards fluency, in which Steven Gerrard was ordinary and which had won two of its previous eight Premiership games, left Newcastle in 13th place with 21 points from 18 matches. The recent record under Graeme Souness reads one win in eight league games and that victory was against Crystal Palace a month ago. Injury, illness and some bad luck continue to scupper ambitions of progress, but most of all it is rank bad defending and a fundamental failing in the decision-making at the top. Souness took a long time to emerge from the away dressing room after this and when he did it was to say: \"Now we find ourselves in a difficult situation. \"We have to stand up and be counted and see what we're all made of in the coming weeks. We are under no illusions as to what is expected of us at Newcastle.\" Souness said there had been a long inquisition in the dressing room, though \"not a screaming match. It was quite civilised, maybe too civilised for my liking\". Too civilised is not an accusation Newcastle's players have had to fend off in recent seasons. Lee Bowyer's red card did not prompt thoughts of civility and yesterday morning Souness woke up to another headline about Newcastle players' behaviour on a day off in London. Naturally the players stayed at the Ritz hotel, the management of which felt compelled to send Souness a letter of complaint about as yet unspecified goings-on. Souness confirmed that he had received the letter but he dismissed claims of \"over-boisterousness\". In fact Souness's initial reaction to that charge was \"good\". Then he added: \"They're boys - it was their day off.\" That's all right then. Souness probably did not want to dwell on that issue because he has enough to concern him. Newcastle are sliding and despite all the noises emanating from within St James' Park that external influences are at play, neither fans nor journalists kick the ball on a weekend. Souness has identified again-unspecified \"mischief makers\" around the club and likened it to running a \"Latin\" country. Yet even in the banana republic of Newcastle United the people speak their minds. What they see is not convincing them that Newcastle are close to discovering a true sense of purpose or direction. Things, moreover, may get worse before they get better. Next Sunday Newcastle are on the road again. They travel to Blackburn Rovers, whose players are not likely to be demotivated by having their former manager on the Newcastle bench. Mark Hughes will note that only West Bromwich Albion have conceded more than Newcastle away from home. Bryan Robson has been in charge at the Hawthorns around half the time of Souness at St James' and on Saturday received abuse from West Brom fans. Newcastle's travelling fans have yet to voice similar criticism about Souness. They will withhold judgment until after the transfer window has closed. Souness was in France on Friday night watching Marseille's centre-half Abdoulaye Meite and nothing Titus Bramble did yesterday makes that an illegitimate expense. Yet the memory of Alain Goma or Marcelino hardly douses doubts about Newcastle and foreign centre-halves. This, of course, should have been addressed years ago. Souness has inherited the problem from Sir Bobby Robson, who bought Bramble. Had Souness, or any manager, arrived in the summer it would have made solution-finding easier. But 2004 has not been good to Newcastle. Failure to re-qualify for the Champions League eventually led to Robson's departure and over the course of the year in 37 league games Newcastle have won only 12. They have taken only two points from the last 12 and if, after Boxing Day at Blackburn, it is two from 15, the discontent will spread. And three days after that it is Arsenal. St James' is preparing for winter's chill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
