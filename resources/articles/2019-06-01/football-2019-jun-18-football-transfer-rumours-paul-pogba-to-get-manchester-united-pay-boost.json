United might turn their attention to a cheaper option in the shape of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Thomas Meunier, available for a mere \u00a325m, but missing out on Wan-Bissaka would, according to the Mirror, \u201cdeal a huge blow to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s transfer plans\u201d. In further defensive reinforcement news, United hope that Leicester will be more inclined to sell them Harry Maguire if they are given Andreas Pereira, once a target for Brendan Rodgers at Celtic, on loan in return. And in further Leicester defensive news, the Foxes are ready to pay \u00a312m for the Luton full-back James Justin, for whom Aston Villa have already had a \u00a37.5m bid rejected, even though he is only expected to be a back-up for their first-choice right-back, Ricardo Pereira (that\u2019s right, Leicester could have a pair o\u2019 Pereiras next season). Now, back to Manchester United \u2013 a phrase Paul Pogba very much hopes he won\u2019t be saying when pre-season training gets under way in a couple of weeks. The wantaway Frenchman continues to hope that Real Madrid will make a decent bid \u2013 several papers report that they have offered \u00a390m, which is barely enough to buy you a Wan-Bissaka these days \u2013 but in the meantime the Spaniards keep spending: with \u00a3275m already lavished on players including Eden Hazard, Luka Jovic and Ferland Mendy, Tuesday\u2019s A Bola says they are in the process of wrapping up a \u20ac20m deal to sell Ra\u00fal de Tom\u00e1s to Benfica. Besides, according to the Mail, United have resolved to retain Pogba and will sanction a bumper pay rise from his current meagre \u00a3290,000 a week to a more generous \u00a3500,000, matching the amount being pocketed by Alexis S\u00e1nchez. \u201cUnited chief Ed Woodward is adamant a player who is as central to the club\u2019s commercial interests as he is on the pitch will not be sold,\u201d it writes. Arsenal want a new defender, and are deciding between RB Leipzig\u2019s Dayot Upamecano and Saint-\u00c9tienne\u2019s William Saliba. The latter is their first choice, but the 18-year-old\u2019s club are demanding both a \u00a326.7m fee and a one-year loan-back arrangement, neither of which are filling the Gunners with glee. Unai Emery has a transfer budget of only \u00a345m, and such a move would leave him without much left to spend, but on the other hand there is talk of interest from Manchester City, and seeing him elsewhere in the Premier League would be galling. City, meanwhile, are in pursuit of greater depth at left-back and might end up re-buying Angelino from PSV Eindhoven, says the Sun. A buy-back clause was inserted into the deal that took him to Holland for \u00a35m last summer, and with the player now rated at \u00a323m and attracting interest from PSG and Arsenal they could bring him back for less than half his market value. The Mirror predicts that Frank Lampard\u2019s No 1 top priority at Chelsea if and when he gets the job will be to persuade Willian to snub a potential move to Barcelona and instead commit himself to a new two-year deal at Stamford Bridge, which would tie him to the club until he is 33. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid have also been interested, but Chelsea have turned down offers of \u00a335m and with Atl\u00e9ti in the process of completing a massive \u20ac120m deal for Jo\u00e3o Felix their wallet may now be empty (though Benfica released a curious statement yesterday insisting \u201cit is false that any negotiation process is currently under way\u201d). Sheffield United have a \u00a320m transfer budget and Chris Wilder\u2019s toppermost priority is the Brentford striker Neal Maupay. The only problem with that is that the Bees value him at \u00a320m, and the Blades don\u2019t want to blow all their spending money at once. Thus Maupay might be sold to Sevilla instead while West Brom\u2019s Jay Rodriguez and Swansea\u2019s Oli McBurnie end up at Bramall Lane. Meanwhile Stoke are finalising deals for Wigan\u2019s Nick Powell and Millwall\u2019s Lee Gregory, and have identified Barnsley\u2019s Adam Davies as the perfect replacement for Jack Butland should anyone prise the England stopper from their grasp."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
