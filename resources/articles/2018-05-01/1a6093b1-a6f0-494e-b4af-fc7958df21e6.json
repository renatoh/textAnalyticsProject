The brow bone underneath is shaved to a gentler curve and her chin chiselled likewise. The face is put back on. Has it made her more of a woman? An extraordinarily complex question for extraordinarily complex times. The nurse is at the 2pass clinic in Belgium, the patient is Munroe Bergdorf, the maker of this documentary, and her face is, for her, too much of a reminder of the sex she was assigned at birth \u2013 male \u2013 in a life in which she now identifies as female after six years of treatment. Now, even before the facial surgery, she \u2013 as the clinic might put it \u2013 \u201cpasses\u201d and has become one of the highest-profile (if you\u2019ll pardon the pun, and there\u2019s no reason you should) activists for trans rights. But is she a woman? Pauline, a member of a focus group convened for the purpose of Bergdorf\u2019s film, What Makes a Woman? (Channel 4), and maybe a generation and a half older than her, isn\u2019t sure. \u201cYou don\u2019t look mannish at all \u2026 When I\u2019m talking to you, I think you\u2019re a woman. But when I know how you started out, part of me thinks you\u2019re a man.\u201d Others are surer. Bergdorf sits in the audience at a meeting of radical feminists who think that \u201cmen performing men\u2019s idea of what it is to be a woman\u201d does not make a woman, and that \u201cself-identity [professing yourself to be female despite your male biological birth sex and especially before any kind of transition treatment and/or gender reassignment surgery] reduces what it is to be a woman to a feeling in a man\u2019s head\u201d. Parsing the differences between these three stances \u2013 Bergdorf\u2019s, Pauline\u2019s and the feminists\u2019 \u2013 and asking how we approach an increase in understanding between them all could have helpfully taken up more of the film. The political and philosophical questions raised by the idea of feeling like a man or woman trapped in a wrongly sexed body are quite possibly infinite. But the few posed overtly here \u2013 primarily by Venice Allan (known as Dr Radfem on her YouTube channel and recently suspended from the Labour party for beliefs it deemed transphobic) \u2013 were not properly engaged with. What was most striking about the conversation between her and Bergdorf, in which Allan outlined her objections to proposed changes to legislation that would allow any cis man (that is, man born male and identifying as such) into any female space (toilets, changing rooms etc) simply by claiming that he identifies as a woman. This, she says, is the beginning of the erasure of hard-won rights and protections for women. Bergdorf argues that trans women experience much violence (from cis men, it is implied) and are not violent towards women. But this is, surely, not the fear? The fear is that it is precisely not trans women who will cause trouble, but the cis men bent on intimidating women who will use the new law as another way to do so. But instead of interrogating this \u2013 and possibly going into a wider examination of the apparent unwillingness to look beyond women (cis or trans) as the source of the problem \u2013 we moved instead to Bergdorf talking about how she was raped as she began transitioning. A terrible story, but unconsciously used here in place of a rigorous response. Another huge area for debate in the area of trans rights and politics, and more pertinent to the subject of what makes a woman, was touched on only lightly, at the beginning and end of the film, without any development in between. At a genderqueer fashion show, Bergdorf meets a model who says it\u2019s \u201cfine to be a tomgirl\u201d even if you identify as female. You don\u2019t have to perform, in other words, at the extreme end of femininity to be a woman. Bergdorf tells her it took her much longer to get there. In the closing minutes of the programme, Bergdorf remarks that: \u201cI\u2019ve never said that I\u2019m a cisgender woman \u2026 I identify more with the female side in a world that gives me two options.\u201d So, does society force you into being a woman if you don\u2019t identify as masculine? We surely need, then, a sequel: what makes a man?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
