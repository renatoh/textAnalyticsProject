They live on shit and they are uninvited.\" Give this man a series! \u00b7 Which hot-shot TV producer has had a hushed-up punch-up with his big-name star? They say: \"We look forward to working together on TV projects in the future.\" Monkey says: \"Don't hold your breath.\" If only they hadn't axed Celebrity Boxing. \u00b7 Funniest TV moment of last week was on Johnny Vaughan's ground-breaking BBC3 chatshow, and we never thought we'd say that. Top of the bill were new BBC3 signings Adam and Joe, who were wheeled on to review some of the weirdest and wackiest shows on digital TV. Introducing the item, Adam (or was it Joe?) told Vaughan, \"Digital TV, eh? We're going to end up there even faster than you, Johnny.\" The smile on Vaughan's face was more fixed than the Warren Report. \u00b7 Monkey can't wait for the newspaper industry's annual summer beano, the British Press Awards. To whet our appetite even further, the organisers took out a full-page ad in the current Press Gazette entitled the \"legends of journalism\" which lists the previous winners of the awards in tribute to their peerless journalistic prowess. Except there haven't really been enough winners yet to fill a whole page, so many of the names are repeated over and over - and over - again. Oh look, there's Allison Pearson. Oh, and there's Allison Pearson again. And, yes, Allison Pearson. In fact, the occasional Late Reviewer scores a total of 17 mentions. Seventeen? Next time fellas, why not save our time and your money and stick an ad in the classified section instead? \u00b7 Ten out of 10 to ITN for recycling. No, not their news stories, silly, but the set of their old ITN News Channel (what do you mean you've never heard of it?). Monkey missed its rather snazzy, minimalist set, which was given the heave-ho when the channel was rebranded the ITV News Channel (still not heard of it?). So imagine our delight when it unexpectedly turned up again as the backdrop of Five News's \"Meet the Press\" slot. Good to see the cost-conscious commercial news operation is adhering to the principle of waste not, want not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
