With Martin Johnson due to name his party of 44 for a summer tour of Australia and New Zealand tomorrow and Cipriani certain to remain in the international wilderness, the Barbarians match would have given the fly-half a last chance to embarrass the England team manager and his selectors before setting off for Melbourne, two seasons in the Super 15 and Test exile. That intriguing prospect flew out of the window after 23 minutes at Kingston Park on Saturday, when Cipriani went off after a heavy tackle followed by a hasty touch down in his own in-goal area to end a Newcastle attack. He was in so much discomfort that he had to be given a whiff of oxygen. The early diagnosis was that the thumb was bust. \"Dan was in a considerable amount of pain,\" said the Wasps director of rugby Tony Hanks. \"He made a tackle just as they made a break just before he forced it down. He is pretty sore.\" At the very least it was an unsatisfactory way for Cipriani to end seven years with Wasps, even if he is thinking of breaking his time at Melbourne with a spell at High Wycombe next season. It means Johnson can forget that mischievous Barbarians selection, even if Wasps pose him other problems. Hanks confirmed on Saturday that talks with England about whether Phil Vickery and Tom Rees, both recently returned from long-term injury, should tour were ongoing, although he and his head coach, Shaun Edwards, did recommend that Dan Ward-Smith, who has moved from back row to lock, had done more than enough to warrant a place on the plane. After Ward-Smith had put Wasps into a lead they never surrendered, Edwards described the former Bristol player as a prototype lock of the future, giving more than a hint that with George Skivington going to Leicester this summer, that is where Ward-Smith will be playing for much of next season. That would leave Wasps to concentrate their resources on replacing Paul Sackey, another try scorer on Saturday. The wing's 60-yard sprint down the right, after a blind-side break by the scrum-half Joe Simpson, was the highlight of a game which saw Wasps cement fifth place in the Guinness Premiership, making Heineken Cup rugby a certainty next season. They were unable, however, to shift Bath from the final play-off place, so for the second season running \u2013 and after six seasons of championships and Heineken Cups \u2013 Wasps have finished without any silverware.
