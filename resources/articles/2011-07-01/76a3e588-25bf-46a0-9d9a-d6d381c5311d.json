Prosecutors are attempting to gather evidence to stand up allegations that Ecclestone paid a $50m (\u00a331m) bribe to Gerhard Gribkowsky, a former chief risk manager of the state-owned BayernLB bank, during the sale of a stake in the sport to the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners in 2006. Prosecutors allege that Gribkowsky persuaded the bank to sell its stake \"without evaluation of its current value\" and that \"two consultancy contracts totalling $50m\" were paid to an Austrian company registered in his name. Gribkowsky, who has been held in a Munich prison since January, claims that he received this money from Ecclestone. A nominal deadline for prosecutors to file charges against Ecclestone and Gribkowsky passed on Tuesday. Ecclestone, 80, who travelled to Germany in April to speak with the prosecutors, said he has no case to answer. \"I have done nothing so I have no idea what charges they could bring,\" he told the Times. \"I have done what I had to do at all times during this investigation and I have co-operated fully with the people in Germany. As far as I am concerned there are no problems.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
