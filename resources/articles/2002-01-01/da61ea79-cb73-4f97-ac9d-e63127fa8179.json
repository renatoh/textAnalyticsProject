But as Nasser Hussain returned last night, for the first time as an England cricketer, to Madras, the city of his birth, he took another opportunity to restate his personal truth: that he feels entirely English. Hussain's frustration has occasionally been apparent - no more so than during last summer's Test series against Pakistan - about second- and third-generation Anglo-Asians whose loyalties remain with Pakistan or India rather than the country of their birth. His words, unfortunately and at times cynically, have been hijacked by those seeking to make political capital out of a contentious issue. Some applaud him for assimilating so easily, and hold him up as an example to follow; others depict his straightforward faith in his Englishness as naive, even disloyal. Both are imposing their own agenda; all that he is doing is telling it as it is. Hussain's return to Madras, for the first time since a pre-university exploration of his roots 15 years ago, demanded that he underlined that he has never felt any divided loyalties because of his Indian birthplace and English upbringing. He felt that way before the start of the Test series in November, and nothing has changed his mind. \"It's an easy position for me,\" he said. \"I feel for some people who don't find it such an easy position. I've always been English; I am proud of my roots, proud of my English side, proud of being England captain. \"Everything I know, all my schoolboy heroes both football and cricket, have been English so there's no sort of worries there.\" There will be one long celebration for the Hussain family in Madras over the next couple of days. Madras cricket club, where Hussain first picked up a bat and watched his family play, will mark the occasion tomorrow, on the eve of the third one-day international, and the Hussain family is organising a celebration dinner. But in truth it will be not so much for Nasser as for his father Joe. \"What I do have is a close alliance with my dad, and I'm proud of what he has done for me, and as his roots come from Madras I'm proud to go back there,\" Hussain said. \"I have emotional ties to my dad and for him it will be a very special moment. \"A lot of who I am, as a man and a cricketer, is down to my old man, so in that way it's a huge game for me because it's such a big game for him.\" For all Hussain's sense of Englishness, he has been at ease in India in a manner given to few India captains. Hussain's England have avoided a siege mentality, even if security concerns, and a crowded itinerary, have left them largely confined to their hotel rooms. He has responded to all demands diplomatically and warmly, and has been repaid in kind - even to the point of being praised in the society pages as a sex symbol, which led one team-mate to remark that \"Vladimir Putin noses\" must be in vogue in India this year. \"I've enjoyed every moment of this winter because I've had no ill feeling at all. I don't think any of the team have, to be honest. Everywhere the team goes, people have been waving at us. There's been no booing. They clapped my fifties in the Test matches and today, coming off, they clapped me, and I enjoy playing out here. They appreciate good cricket out here. They're just mad about Tendulkar, that's all.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
