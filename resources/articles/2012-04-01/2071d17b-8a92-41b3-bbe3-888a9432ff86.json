The NHS Confederation said responsibility for child health would in future be divided up among four different organisations spread across a range of geographical tiers, leading to potential confusion about who is accountable for the care and safety of children with complex needs. It said the new system left children's health services potentially uncordinated and fragmented, and called on ministers to urgently clarify responsibilities. Confusion among different organisations about who was responsible for safeguarding vulnerable children had at the root of a number of child protection tragedies in recent years, said Jo Webber, deputy director of policy at the NHS Confederation. \"We know through painful experience that it is between the gaps in responsibilities that the most tragic and difficult cases fall. With nothing making these organisations work together in the way they should, we have to be honest that the risk of us failing is more likely. \"The time has come to be honest with government and together now resolve these issues before a policy problem becomes a tragic failure.\" There was \"deep unease\" that the reforms introduced by the NHS bill would disrupt improvements in safeguarding that she claimed the NHS had made in recent years and would see the health service \"resetting to a model that is potentially riskier and certainly more fragmented.\" She said this was an opportunity for the NHS to make sure it did not repeat the mistakes of the past. \"We need to get clarity. For people working in the system it is unsettling not knowing how things will work through.\" Responsibility for safeguarding children is currently shared between local authorities and primary care trusts (PCTs). When PCTs are abolished under the reforms in 2013, that duty will be shared among the NHS Commissioning Board, Public Health England, clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), and local councils. A spokesperson for the Royal College of Paediatrics (RCP) said: \"How safeguarding responsibilities will work in the new NHS is still unclear \u2013 we know statutory duties will transfer to the new organisations but it is how those duties will work in practice that is unclear \u2013 we need to know from government who will do what in the new system.\" The Department of Health said ensuring \"robust arrangements\" were in place on child health was a priority. It would be consulting soon on new statutory guidance on safeguarding children. Last month the RCP said in a report that its members feared that safeguarding was \"an afterthought\" in the NHS reforms. Some clinical commissioning groups were not making children - let alone child protection- a high priority and in some areas child health was not a priority at all. The RCP survey of senior child health doctors found that only 12% believed the reforms would improve safeguarding. It said \"lack of clarity about the nature and structure of the health reforms may allow vulnerable services and patients to slip through gaps\" and warned that there was \"a risk of misunderstandings, of 'eyes being taken off the ball'\" under the new arrangements."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
