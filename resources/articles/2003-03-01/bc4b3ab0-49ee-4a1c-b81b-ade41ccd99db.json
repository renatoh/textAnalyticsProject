The boycott of applications called by leading independent schools was \"misguided\", he said, and urged them to have a \"mature conversation\" with the university about their complaints. Mr Clarke, who this week publicly slapped down the higher education minister, Margaret Hodge, for proposing a target for the percentage of working class students, said universities should devise their own admissions policies. Yesterday the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and Girls' Schools' Association accused Bristol of discriminating against students from \"good schools\" in both the state and fee-paying sectors and declared they would not be encouraging their pupils to apply there \"for the time being\" as heads were becoming increasingly concerned that their students were losing out. Mr Clarke said the action was misguided and the brouhaha in the Daily Mail and other papers had been ill-informed. Most of the middle class did not send their children to fee-paying schools - 56% of adults were classified as white collar workers and 21% professionals and managers, yet only 7% of pupils were in private schools. \"Most of the middle classes don't send their children to private schools. What most of them want are well-maintained state schools.\" He quoted the headmaster of Millfield school, Peter Johnson, who said he did not believe it was his job to tell a pupil to apply to a university, and David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, who called the boycott \"gesture politics of the worst kind\". Mr Clarke commented: \"I haven't discussed it with Bristol and I don't intend to. It would be very dangerous if a secretary of state or a government was developing a national admissions policy for universities.\" He categorically denied he had a social engineering ambition to hit independent schools. \"The whole policy is focused on individuals who have merit and potential and are able to go to university. I don't think the answer is 'a' or 'b' - it's a range of different measures,\" he said. The access regulator, to be established by the government to ensure universities were widening access, would have the power to prevent top-up fees being charged. \"But hopefully it won't have to be used.\" Universities accepted the principle of widening access and wanted to work with the government, he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
