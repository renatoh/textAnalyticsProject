Men need no magic to do harm. If they did, there would be a good deal less suffering in the world.\u201d It was a line that kept coming back to me as presenter and producer Ramita Navai\u2019s documentary The UN Sex Abuse Scandal unfolded. Her film set out the scale and dimensions of \u2013 well, I was going to say the predatory behaviour of some uniformed members and civilians undertaking UN peacekeeping missions. But as we saw recently when objections were raised to a Guardian headline on migrant children \u201cselling sex\u201d to pay for passage from Italy to France, on the grounds that it could more accurately be rendered \u201cchildren being raped by adults\u201d (it was amended to \u201csexually exploited\u201d), there are many ways to put these things. By the end of the gruelling hour it was clear that another description, at least as accurate, might be that it was the bleakest reading yet taken of men\u2019s capacity for sexual violence. Navai\u2019s film involved careful, dignified interviews with survivors of rape and abuse at the hands of those whom they had looked for protection. It calmly laid out the parlous state of the system for reporting and prosecuting the crimes and supporting their victims, and the historical and continuing impunity with which the perpetrators operate as the UN talks fine talk about zero tolerance, but when it comes to walking the walk prefers to slump into the nearest armchair with a shrug and, perhaps, a hopeless shake of the head at the intractability of the problem. \u201cSo many men to control,\u201d seemed to be the attitude \u2013 \u201cwhat can you do?\u201d. In the past 15 years, 1,700 allegations of UN sexual violence have been made, from Bosnia to Cambodia, Congo to Haiti. These are only the ones reported and recorded. We can infer that, as with statistics on just about every form of sexual violence, they represent the merest tip of the iceberg. A total of 53 uniformed peacekeepers and one civilian have been jailed as a result. We heard testimony from two children who fell victim to French troops \u2013 there to protect them from warring militia in Congo and the Central African Republic \u2013 five years ago. Alexis, then 15, described children giving peacekeepers oral sex in return for soldiers\u2019 rations. \u201cThey weren\u2019t even good rations,\u201d she noted. \u201cThey were just their leftovers.\u201d Daniella was 10 when a group of peacekeepers offered her water, then grabbed her, took her into a house, \u201ctook off my clothes, threw me down and had sex with me, then told me to go\u201d. Word reached a UN human rights worker, who compiled a report full of what Paula Donovan, a campaigner against UN sexual abuse, described as \u201cstunning revelations \u2026 that [the UN] treated as just another report from the field.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until the report was leaked to the media that an independent inquiry was commissioned, which uncovered a tale of complacency and buck-passing that amounted to gross institutional failure and an abuse of authority. In the three years since, it seems that little has changed. Thirty-two new allegations of exploitation and abuse have been lodged with the UN so far this year. A dropbox nailed to an office in the middle of nowhere and not labelled in the local language was where violated women were supposed to leave their complaints. Promises of victim support have, at least as far as Navai\u2019s numerous interviewees\u2019 experience went, gone unfulfilled. A single day\u2019s inquiry by the documentary team\u2019s local producer found several young women whom the UN said it could not find. It seems these things are not difficult if you have the will. The team also passed on their discovery of a hitherto unknown victim of former UN peacekeeper Didier Bourguet, convicted in 2008 of two of the 20 rapes of children with which he was charged, including a 12-year-old girl. Navai also interviewed Bourguet, who is now out of prison. He assured her it had been easy to find children. \u201cIf you have money. Of course, they were starving. That\u2019s why.\u201d If only there were some diabolical external force to blame. But here we are, in a world in which peacekeepers can be predators, care systems effectively funnel girls to grooming gangs, and call logs and police reports from immigrant child shelters in the US show men already moving in on the newest-minted mass of vulnerable children \u2013 and needing no magic to do harm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
