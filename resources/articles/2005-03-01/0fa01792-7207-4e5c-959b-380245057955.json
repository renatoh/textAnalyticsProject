The son of Sadler's Wells finished fourth in the French Derby following that Listed race success at York but came back the worse for wear from his foray abroad and yesterday's victory was a relief for trainer John Gosden. Day Flight had to be asked a question or two before getting the better of main market rival Blythe Knight and as Richard Hughes returned aboard the winner, Gosden suggested to the jockey that Day Flight had used \"all the tricks\" in the home straight. Gosden said: \"He got jarred up in the French Derby. The ground was quick, the grass was short and they did two minutes 25, which is a remarkable time considering the uphill finish there. Then we tried to bring him back in the autumn, which didn't work out, but he has done that fine. As long as it is good, good to soft, we'll be okay. \"He might turn out to be an out-and-out mile-and-a-half horse, but sticking to 10 furlongs for the time being gives us more options to play with.\" Yesterday's ground was a shade quicker than would have been ideal, but Gosden seemed satisfied with the end result and will now run Day Flight in the Betfred Gordon Richards Stakes at Sandown on April 23. Connections of Blythe Knight were satisfied with his three-length defeat and indicated that he could take his chance in Saturday's Stanleybet Lincoln at Doncaster. Totesport left his price unchanged at 16-1. Iffraaj, another \"talking horse\", also came good in the JSC PR Straight From Horse's Mouth Handicap under Philip Robinson. Well backed in the betting offices in the morning, the lightly raced four-year-old has had his problems with injury and had been restricted to just three outings before yesterday's success. But despite allowing the talented High Reach to get first run at the furlong pole, Robinson refused to panic aboard the 3-1 winner, who led 75 yards from the finish to score by a length. \"Sheikh Ahmed doesn't have many four-year-olds, but this was a nice horse who never had a chance to fulfil his potential once he picked up a leg problem early last season,\" said trainer Michael Jarvis. \"We will take the handicap route with him and hopefully pick up a nice one before his mark gets too high.\" Obe Gold turned in a fine weight-carrying effort to take the JSC Sports Media Relations And Sponsorship Conditions Stakes under Sam Hitchcott. \"He did have a lot on at the weights, being a three-year-old only receiving a couple of pounds from his older rivals,\" said winning trainer Mick Channon, \"but I thought it was worth giving it a try as it would give us an idea where we are. \"He's in the Free Handicap and I think he will stay seven furlongs without much trouble. The other race I have had in mind for him for a long time is the Field Marshal Stakes at Haydock [back over five furlongs].\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
