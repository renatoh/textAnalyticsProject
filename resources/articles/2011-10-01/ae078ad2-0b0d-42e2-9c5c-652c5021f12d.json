The former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive joined CAA a little under two years ago to head up its international sports division. Although not thought to be linked, his departure comes less than a fortnight after an unconfirmed report that Fifa is investigating the activities of Quality Football Ireland, one of a number of companies that CAA incorporated to take up third-party-ownership stakes in players. As detailed by the Guardian in August, this venture raised eyebrows in Spain after QFI's investment in the goalkeeper Roberto Jim\u00e9nez's registration rights permitted Real Zaragoza to purchase him. The concerns centred on the fact that at the time the club was under the courts' bankruptcy protection for near-\u00a3100m debts. Though the deal did not break Spanish football regulations, since \u2013 in contrast to the English leagues \u2013 third-party ownership is permitted there, the matter may have caused embarrassment at CAA's head office. Its general counsel, Michael Rubel, was named as the principal director of Quality Football Ireland, a company incorporated six months after Kenyon joined CAA. The agency owned 70% of the start-up's shares, the other 30% being split equally between the co-head of CAA's sports unit, Michael Levine, and its managing partner, David O'Connor. Kenyon departs at the same time as Philippe Le Floc'h, the former head of marketing at Uefa. Neither responded to the Guardian's messages on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
