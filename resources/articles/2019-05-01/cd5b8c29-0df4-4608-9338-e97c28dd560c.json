It might not have matched Liverpool v Barcelona, or Ajax v Spurs but it wasn\u2019t a million miles away. You have to feel for Frankfurt \u2013 the underdogs were probably the better side at Stamford Bridge and a European final would have capped a magnificent season for the German side. With their star player Jovic almost certain to leave in the summer, it could be a long time before we see them in the last four of a European competition again. Fair play to Chelsea, they just about held their nerve with a little help from a couple of goal-line clearances. They will face Arsenal in another all-English final. Thanks for joining me, and for your emails and tweets. Until next time! Cool. The matchwinner, Eden Hazard, is next to speak: In the first half we were the better side. Always after five minutes in the second half, we concede a goal. At the end with penalties, it was 50-50. You never know. I always take my responsibility. I scored, we won. We have to play Arsenal. Against them, we struggle against them in the last two or three years. I don\u2019t think [about my future]. In my mind I don\u2019t know yet. If it is my last game, I will try to do everything to win a trophy. In my mind I don\u2019t know yet [if it will be his last game].\u201d This is a good stat. If Chelsea win, it will be Sarri\u2019s first trophy as a manager. The closest he has come to silverware before this season was the 2013-14 Serie B title, where he finished runner up in charge of Empoli. Chelsea have now played more than 60 matches this season, which is more than any other side in Europe\u2019s top-five leagues. I wonder how fresh the legs will be compared to Arsenal come Baku. It hasn\u2019t been a straightforward season for Sarri, but a third-place finish and two cup finals ain\u2019t bad. All that, with off-field issues like a transfer embargo and the uncertainty around Hazard\u2019s future. Time to put some more respect on Sarri\u2019s name. Here he is. I think we played a very good first half. But then we went in trouble, so we conceded a goal, 10 minutes of panic. Better in the last part of the match. I think we were really tired. We lost Christensen, we lost Loftus. It\u2019s not easy, but we play the final. Loftus is not a serious problem, but he had the normal cramp after 75 minutes. There is no preparation for penalties. You can kick the ball well in the training ground, but you need a great character. You cannot practice for penalties, it\u2019s useless. I didn\u2019t watch the final two penalties so I didn\u2019t see Kepa\u2019s saves. We have to rest. Unfortunately we have to go to the United States. But we have to recover energy. Ciao. Sarri is making reference to Chelsea\u2019s charity match in the US just three days after the final game of season, two weeks before the Europa League final. They will play New England Revolution in Massachusetts on 15 May with proceeds from the friendly to be dedicated to initiatives to combat antisemitism and all hate crimes. I hope Glenn Hoddle\u2019s heart is OK. He\u2019s been through the wringer these last couple of nights. If this isn\u2019t enough to finally convince the Premier League to introduce a winter break, I don\u2019t know what will. Dominic Fifield\u2019s match report from Stamford Bridge will follow shortly. Kepa speaks! \u201cThe atmosphere was really good. We played against a very strong team. Always we prepare for the Frankfurt takers in the penalties. Wembley I learned [from}. I said sorry. Today was another game. We are very happy.\u201d He\u2019s referring of course to the Carabao Cup final, in which he played a starring role for the wrong reasons. Some Frankfurt fans are in tears. They were probably the better side here tonight, and were also ahead in the penalty shootout, but blew it. They\u2019ve had a magnificent season, but you suspect their best players (Jovic, Rebic, Da Costa) might be poached in the summer. They are currently in the Champions League places on goal difference, with two games to play. I hope they complete the job. What a script! On what will probably be his final appearance for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Hazard was ice cool. It was a risk leaving their best penalty taker last, but it paid off! Fair play to Kepa, he was brilliant there. Hazard sends Trapp the wrong way. Stamford Bridge erupts! The sub sees his shot saved by Kepa! Chelsea have a shot to win the semi-final! Chelsea are back level! Hinteregger goes straight down the middle, Kepa stays still, and the ball wedges between Kepa\u2019s legs. Saved! After a funny little hop in his run-up, Jorginho sends Trapp the wrong way to keep the pressure on the German side. The Dutchman sends Kepa the wrong way, Frankfurt keep their 100% record. Trapp dives to his left, and tips it wide. Jovic just about squeezes it in, inches past Kepa\u2019s glove Trapp guesses right but Barkley finds the side netting! The Frenchman calmly rolls it to Kepa right. Eintracht Frankfurt will go first. The shootout will be at the Shed End, where the Frankfurt fans are stationed. Chelsea have only won one penalty shootout in Uefa competition history, but that was in the 2012 Champions League final. Interesting to see who will be Chelsea\u2019s five penalty takers. I\u2019d have: Hazard, Higuain, David Luiz, Barkley \u2026 er I\u2019m running out of options now \u2026 Azpilicueta? Pedro? To penalties we go! 120+1 min: David Luiz does really well to beat Haller in the air. David Luiz had a bit of a nightmare for the Frankfurt goal, but since then, he\u2019s been magnificent. 120 min: Free-kick to Frankfurt, deep in Chelsea\u2019s half. Here come the German cavalry from the back. Two minutes added on for injury time. Stamford Bridge holds its breath. 118 min: Frankfurt make their extra-time substitution, Paciencia coming on for Gacinovic. That\u2019s been a long-time coming. Gacinovic has been out on his feet for ages. 116 min: As the cross comes in, Trapp catches the ball, before Azpilicueta bundles into the keeper, with the ball dropping the ball into the net. Initially the referee appears to give the goal, but changes his mind and whistles for a free-kick on the goal-line! There\u2019s no VAR here (although there will be in the final in Baku) but replays show a very marginal call. Trapp didn\u2019t have complete control of the ball, but Azpilicueta did take the man first, before he shouldered the ball into the net. Would have been very interesting if VAR was used here. 114 min: End to end stuff now! Hazard carries the ball forward, but looks absolutely knackered. Zappacosta supports the Belgian, and the ball eventually finds its way to the full-back, who brings a brilliant save out of Trapp with a powerful shot! Corner to Chelsea. 112 min: Chelsea are next to counter-attack, Pedro seems to be the busiest of Chelsea\u2019s players and the Spaniard slips Emerson in down the left wing. Emerson drives into the box and shoots from an acute angle, Trapp parries and Emerson is there for the rebound \u2026 but an outstanding slide tackle from Hinteregger stops the Italian from tapping the ball home. What. A. Tackle. Both players go down in a heap, it was a heavy, but fair challenge. 110 min: Truthfully, the match has lost its way in terms of quality. At this point, it\u2019s as much a case of stamina than anything else. Chelsea win a corner, but Barkley can\u2019t flick it home at the near post. 108 min: Higuain gives the ball away carelessly. He\u2019s had no impact since coming on. 107 min: Some Frankfurt fans can\u2019t look. One has his head buried in a hat. Frankfurt are kicking towards their away fans now. Peeeeeep! We\u2019re underway again. The final push before potential penalties. Say that three times fast. \u201cHiguain does look like the depressed wine enthusiast from Sideways,\u201d emails Ian Copesake. He does. Look. Fifteen minutes left. Frankfurt do have a corner to close out the half, and De Guzman\u2019s delivery is met cleanly by Haller, but Zappacosta retreats just in time to head the ball over. There\u2019s no time for Frankfurt to take another corner \u2026 105 min: Hazard is fouled by Da Costa, and Chelsea have a chance to launch it into Frankfurt\u2019s box. They do so, but Trapp comes out to punch well clear. Good goalkeeping. One more minute added on for injury time before the half-way stage in extra time. 103 min: \u201cSpackman was talking about himself maybe?\u201d offers Craig McEwan. 102 min: Barkley channels his inner Kompany, takes a touch before leathering it towards the top corner, but the ball slices away for a goal kick. 100 min: David Luiz clears off the line! Kostic sprints down the left wing for Frankfurt, squares to Haller who is all alone at the back post, six yards out \u2026 but David Luiz gets back to hook Haller\u2019s scuffed finish away. Haller really should have scored, but his effort was definitely heading inside the post before David Luiz\u2019s intervention. 98 min: Chelsea break, and stream forward in numbers, it\u2019s five on two! Hazard carries the ball, commits the defender before passing to Higuain, whose cross is blocked by the only defender, Falette. \u201cTired legs, tired minds,\u201d says the commentator Nigel Spackman of Higuain, who has been on the pitch all of two minutes. 96 min: Chelsea have made three subs, but both sides get an extra one in extra time, so Higuain comes on for Giroud. 95 min: Zappacosta wins a corner for Chelsea \u2013 he\u2019s been good since coming on to be fair \u2013 from which Azpilicueta volleys over, with the ball arriving at an awkward height. 94 min: Frankfurt look absolutely knackered, but I think think they carry more of a goal threat. My prediction is that if Chelsea can get to half-time in extra time without conceding, Chelsea will score in the second half of extra time. Defending from both sides is becoming increasingly desperate. 92 min: I would be very surprised if we end this extra time with 22 men still on the pitch. Azpilicueta is on his last chance, surely. Peeeeep! We\u2019re underway again at the Bridge. Thirty minutes of extra time to play, and then potentially penalties. \u201cGooner here,\u201d emails Ryan Barnes. \u201cWeird cheering for Chelsea but the final wouldn\u2019t be as fun with Frankfurt, although perhaps an easier opponent. Having said that, Chelsea already have their Champions League ticket. I\u2019m overthinking this; I\u2019m just going to tuck into a Nando\u2019s and call it a night.\u201d Pretty sure you\u2019re in the minority, Ryan. Imagine most Arsenal fans will be cheering Frankfurt on. Nothing comes of the corner. We\u2019re headed to extra time! 90+5 min: Azpilicueta handballs \u2013 that\u2019s three times he could have been showed a yellow card. A Frankfurt free kick is lumped forward, David Luiz heading behind for a corner. Sarri is going absolutely mental on the touchline, tapping his watch, apparently oblivious to the fact that it is a minimum of five minutes that should be played. 90+4 min: It\u2019s all over in Valencia. Whoever wins here, Arsenal will be the opponent in the Europa League final. 90+3 min: Corner for Chelsea, which is easily caught by Trapp under no pressure. Genuinely have no idea who is going to win this one. 90+2 min: Frankfurt make their next change: Rebic off for Haller, like for like swap up top. 90+1 min: Two more yellow cards for Frankfurt players, both for clumsy tackles on Hazard. Hinteregger and De Guzman are the ones in the book. 90 min: Both teams looks absolutely spent. Five minutes added on for injury time. If we don\u2019t have a goal, we\u2019re going to extra time. 88 min: Chelsea fans do find their voice again, roaring their team on. Kovacic carelessly loses the ball on the edge of Frankfurt\u2019s box and the German side counter at pace. The ball finds its way to Jovic in the box, but some excellent defending from Emerson sees off the danger. 86 min: Chelsea make their final change, Barkley on for Loftus-Cheek and the home fans let Sarri know exactly what they think about that. A chorus of boos sounds around the stadium, as Loftus-Cheek trudges off shaking his head. It\u2019s true he hasn\u2019t been at his best since half-time, but Kovacic hasn\u2019t exactly been tearing up trees. 84 min: Azpilicueta gets lucky again! This time, he\u2019s late on Rebic, another challenge that could have earned him a red card via a second yellow. It\u2019s in a dangerous position though, just on the edge of Chelsea\u2019s box. De Guzman is over it, shoots \u2026 but the wall does its job, jumping and David Luiz (I think) heads it away. 82 min: The game has really opened up, which suits Frankfurt you would think. They hit Chelsea on the bench, and for a moment the London side look awfully exposed before Azpilicueta goes flying into Gacinovic with an awful tackle, catching the Serbian with his studs just below the knee. It so easily could have been a red card, but the referee opts for yellow, much to the distain of the Frankfurt bench. They are also livid that the referee didn\u2019t play advantage, Chelsea were two on two at the back if play continued. 80 min: Whisper it, but David Luiz has suddenly started playing very well. Jorginho too. Chelsea looking much stronger in this last five minutes. 78 min: Zappacosta goes close! The sub tries his luck from 25 yards, his shot looks like an easy save for Trapp before a late wobble on the ball forces the Frankfurt keeper to palm it into a dangerous area \u2026 but no Chelsea player is there to mop up the loose ball. That was Chelsea\u2019s first shot on target in this second half. 77 min: Meanwhile, in Valencia, Arsenal are cruising towards victory. They are 3-2 up on the night, 6-3 up on aggregate. 75 min: \u201cSo Man City will win the league, Liverpool play Spurs for the Champions League, Chelsea play Arsenal for Europa, and Man United \u2026 have a wonderful new documentary to watch about the 1999 Season.\u201d 73 min: Christensen is the next man down, after another heavy fall. He\u2019s going to have to come off. The camera pans to Gary Cahill, who couldn\u2019t look less ready to come on if he was tucked up in bed with a hot chocolate. Instead Sarri elects Zappacosta to come on, with Azpilicueta moving to centre back and the Italian coming on at right back. What a par for Cahill. 72 min: David Luiz tries his luck from Essien-esque range. The ball flies harmlessly wide. He hit the bar in the first leg with a free-kick but I\u2019m struggling to remember the last time one of those went in for the defender. Frankfurt do indeed make a change: Rode off, former Swansea midfielder De Guzman on. 71 min: \u201cSarri changing his substitutions?\u201dasks Neal Butler. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2018avin a laff! Though, if we do go to extra time and it looks like we\u2019re going to penalties, I wonder will he try taking Kepa for Caballero...?\u201d 70 min: Rode goes down in a heap, clutching his knee. He\u2019s going to have to come off I think, which wouldn\u2019t be the worst idea for Frankfurt, with the German being on a yellow card. 68 min: Speaking of Hazard, he\u2019s been completely anonymous since half-time. Not the way he would want his final appearance at Stamford Bridge to pan out. 66 min: \u201cAnother season with David Luiz is a worse thought than one without Eden Hazard,\u201d writes Rob Coughlin. It\u2019s true that the Brazilian has had a poor second half thus far. Rebic is dropping deep and starting to orchestrate the play. He\u2019s bullying both David Luiz and Christensen. 64 min: Da Costa is the latest to break forward, down Chelsea\u2019s left flank to the byline, and a dangerous cutback is cleared by Azpilicueta. Frankfurt are streaming forward in real numbers. They look like the team more likely to score next. 63 min: Right on cue, Willian is hooked for Pedro. The Brazilian doesn\u2019t look too happy about it. 62 min: This is now a very open game. Azpilicueta whips a dangerous ball in between goalkeeper and defence, Trapp can only divert it into a crowd of bodies, and Hasebe hacks it clear. If that fell to a blue shirt, Chelsea would be back in front. 60 min: Gacinovic catches a sweet volley, and the ball travels at lightspeed towards goal. Unfortunately, it\u2019s straight at Kepa, who palms the ball clear. 58 min: Rode is a very lucky boy. He\u2019s already on a yellow card, remember, and careers into the back of Loftus-Cheek. Normally, that would be a caution all day long, but the referee leaves his cards in his pocket. Frankfurt should be down to 10, really. 57 min: Kovacic slightly overcooks a through ball to Hazard \u2026 ooof, if that was a little lighter, Hazard would have been clean throughon goal. I wonder if the fact that we\u2019re headed for extra time will affect Sarri\u2019s substitutions. Normally we\u2019d expect 63 mins: Barkley on for Kovacic, 70: Pedro for Willian, 82: Higuain for Giroud. 54 min: Frankfurt\u2019s tails are up, shooting towards their raucous away fans. Chelsea haven\u2019t settled at all in this second half. \u201cI hate being right all the time,\u201d Jeremy Solomon emails, in reference to his earlier correspondence in which he insisted one goal wouldn\u2019t be enough for Chelsea. 52 min: Kovacic is shown a yellow card for a challenge on Falette. He was only marginally late, but it was a deserved yellow. 50 min: As it stands then, we\u2019re headed to extra time! We\u2019re all square! A ruthless finish from Jovic, who made and finished the move with aplomb. David Luiz was again all at sea as Jovic chested the ball down to Gacinovic, received the return ball and calmly slotted past the outrushing Kepa. Outstanding No 9 play. 48 min: An absolute hospital pass from David Luiz lands Jorginho in all sorts of danger, but a slip from Jovic lets Chelsea off the hook. 47 min: \u201cThis English dominance of all things European (oh the irony) has spoiled it for me,\u201d emails Dr. Ian Copestake. \u201cMy team playing Spurs in Big Cup final has no romance whatsoever. Over familiarity breeds contempt.\u201d 46 min: Frankfurt look like a different team in these opening moments of the second half. Zipping the ball about very nicely. Azpilicueta does well to charge down a long-range Kostic shot. Peeeeeeeep! We\u2019re underway again at the Bridge. The players are back out. No changes from either side at the break. Half-time reading: much of this applies to the Europa League finalists, who would have similar problems in Baku to the ones facing Spurs and Liverpool fans in Madrid. \u201cThere have been way too many passing errors from Chelsea,\u201d emails Jeremy Solomon. \u201cI know Eintracht press high up the pitch, but a lot of errors have been unforced. There could still be a goal in this for Eintracht - I think Chelsea have to score again.\u201d Yep, Frankfurt haven\u2019t really threatened, but they\u2019ve scored in every Europa League game this season, and have options off the bench in the form of the prolific Sebastian Haller. They have beaten Inter, Shakhtar, Benfica, Lazio, Marseille this season, so don\u2019t count them out yet. 45 min: No added time here. Advantage Chelsea. 43 min: Frankfurt need to regroup at half-time. They are not out of this game by a long shot but will need a drastically better second half. 40 min: A brilliant move from Chelsea, let down at the last by a poor touch by Loftus-Cheek. Jorginho starts the move on the edge of his own box, pirouetting around Gacinovic with a beautiful Zidane turn \u2013 all aboard the showboat \u2013 before Loftus-Cheek finds Hazard on the left wing. The ball eventually finds its way to Emerson inside the Frankfurt box, the Italian squares a pass to Loftus-Cheek, but it\u2019s a poor first touch from the big man, and the ball squirms wide. 39 min: Two yellow cards handed out to Frankfurt in two minutes. Falette and Rode are both cautioned, Falette\u2019s in particular was nasty, raking his studs down the back of Willian\u2019s calf. 38 min: Frankfurt are growing into this game, and David Luiz makes a crucial tackle to stop Rebic inside the Chelsea box. Mis-time or miss that and that would have either been a penalty or a clear shot on goal. David Luiz just does enough and Loftus-Cheek is first to the loose ball. 36 min: Loftus-Cheek is having one of those games again. Every touch is silky smooth, and he is bulling Hasebe and Rode with his physicality. \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve seen RLC play, he looks like such a classy all around midfielder,\u201d emails Lee Madden. \u201cStrong in possession, can dribble or pick a pass and contributes both defensively and in goal scoring. All in all, he\u2019s got to be a key part of Sarri (or whoever\u2019s) plans next year an beyond. He\u2019s the closest player Chelsea have had to Michael Ballack or even Frank Lampard in years and Chelsea should give him every opportunity to excel as he really is the most \u2018complete\u2019 midfielder at the club....\u201d 34 min: To the Frankfurt fans\u2019 credit, they are still singing their heart out. They just need to the one away goal, remember, to tie this semi-final up. 32 min: Tussling with Hinteregger under a high ball, Giroud gets a knee to the head as he stoops. Ouch. Looks like he\u2019ll be OK to continue. 30 min: Frankfurt have a corner, take it short, and kick it all the way back to their goalkeeper. What a waste. That was coming. Loftus-Cheek breaks the offside trap in the inside left channel, not tracked by Rode, and the academy graduate has enough time to get his head up and roll a lovely finish across Trapp and just inside the far post. Sarri is a very happy man indeed, roaring his way down the touchline in celebration. 26 min: Frankfurt are really under the cosh here. They just can\u2019t get out. 24 min: Hasebe clears off the line for Frankfurt! David Luiz comes within a few inches of opening the scores, glancing his header towards the back post, but the Japanese midfielder was just able to hook it clear. 23 min: Good save from Trapp! Chelsea again break down the left wing after a lovely flick from Hazard, Emerson cuts the ball back to Giroud at the near post, who wonderfully deflects the cross at goal, but it hits Trapp square in the chest. Chelsea are getting closer. 22 min: David Luiz now finds himself on the left wing \u2013 course he does. 21 min: Lots of high pressing from Frankfurt. So far Chelsea have managed to escape it, with good play from David Luiz, Jorginho and Loftus-Cheek. One suspects they will be caught out at some point. 18 min: There have been two early goals at the Mestella, one each for Valencia and Arsenal, who retain a two-goal advantage on aggregate. Join Paul Doyle for more. 16 min: Corner to Chelsea, from which they fizz a low cross across the six-yard box. It hits Giroud\u2019s shins and the Frenchman tries to wrap his foot around it with his back to goal, but Frankfurt hack it clear. 14 min: Brilliant save from Kepa! A Frankfurt cross comes in from the left and Da Costa hits it flush on the volley first time, his shot swerving towards the top corner. Kepa throws up a hand and turns it over. Frankfurt looking strong here. 13 min: Dangerous free-kick for Frankfurt on the edge of Chelsea\u2019s box \u2026 Kostic drags his effort into the wall. 11 min: Penalty shout for Chelsea! Willian brilliantly skips away from Kostic on the right wing, drives to the byline and cuts the ball back. Giroud tries a backheel finish at the near post but doesn\u2019t connect and Costa bundles Loftus Cheek over at the far post. There was definitely contact, but it looked as though the ball had got away from the Englishman, who dragged his trailing leg against Da Costa to highlight the foul. Nothing given by our Romanian referee Ovidiu Alin Hategan. 9 min: The travelling Frankfurt fans are preposterously loud. Listening though the telly, it genuinely feels like an away game for Chelsea. 8 min: Loftus-Cheek drives forward with the ball, just as he did to great effect in the first leg, but a heavy touch allows Hinteregger to get a toe in and the move fizzles out. 6 min: Jovic is a handsome man, isn\u2019t he? Has a Bond villain air about him. 4 min: The corner is swung in, and Jovic climbs highest, nodding downwards straight at Kepa. Two yards either side of the keeper, and Frankfurt would be in front. 3 min: Christensen goes up for this first aerial dual with Rebic and comes off much worse, landing nastily. He stays on the deck as Frankfurt stream forward and win a corner. 2 min: Looks like Frankfurt have lined up with a back three, which means Da Costa and Kostic will offer plenty of attacking threat as the wing backs. 1 min: Sarri is already half-way through his first cig of the night. Looks a little nervous. Peeeeeeeep! And we\u2019re off. \u201cGary Cahill is on the bench tonight. Chelsea really are down to the bare bones.\u201d Nigel Spackman, stop it! The Europa League anthem is toilet, isn\u2019t it? Meanwhile, the camera pans to the Frankfurt fans, who are in excellent voice, all waving black and white flags. One or two flip the bird at the camera. Spicy. Anyway, five minutes until we reach kick off. The players are in the tunnel, Chelsea wearing all-blue, Eintracht in an all-white number. Send me your predictions, thoughts, hopes and dreams. michael.butler@theguardian.com or @michaelbutler18. I always had a theory that the reason Ballack wore No 13 was because it looked like a capital B, but I have no evidence to back this up. Oooooooof. This stinks of a 2-2 (Frankfurt win on away goals). Ruben Loftus-Cheek was man of the match in the first leg, and he starts again tonight. I didn\u2019t know this, but he\u2019s recently earned the nickname \u2018The Lewisham Ballack\u2019 and would you look at that, the actual Ballack is talking into a microphone, and the former Blue looks a little unsure when he is told about the nickname. Ruben is a very physical player. If he wants to make the step up, he has to show up in this sort of game. He\u2019s a good player. I expect a really open game. Chelsea still have world-class players in the team. The Frankfurt fans were absolutely bonkers in the first-leg last week, so loud that their stadium was physically shaking. This is their first European semi-final for 39 years, and the German boys are making themselves known in London. It\u2019s a very attacking line-up from Frankfurt, who also have Sebastian Haller on the bench. The French striker has scored an impressive 19 goals in all comps this season. Rafa Honigstein, formerly of this church and wearing a choice leather jacket on BT Sport, makes the point that Rebic\u2019s return is a huge plus for the Germans. He does the running for Jovic up top, and allows them to play a much more dynamic pressing game when they don\u2019t have the ball. Some breaking news from Germany: former Huddersfield Town manager David Wagner has been appointed as the new boss of Schalke \u2013 he played for them between 1995-97. From the bottom of the Premier League to one of the biggest clubs in the Bundesliga. Not bad. This season\u2019s Europa League final will be played in Baku, Azerbaijan, which will be problematic in terms of travel for all of the semi-finalists. Arsenal/Chelsea fans, if you don\u2019t fancy flying, you can always take the four-day train from London! Just for you, Joe, here is Colin Pates in all his splendour in 1983, fourth from the left on the back row. I\u2019m pleased to say that Pates is still in football, working as a coach at Whitgift School in south London, the same private school that Callum Hudson Odoi (and Victor Moses) attended. I\u2019m sure that he would have had a hand in their development. Ed Aarons did an excellent piece on Whitgift school earlier this season. Here you are. You can read more on Frankfurt\u2019s collapse at the weekend right here, courtesy of Andy Brassell. Will this be Eden Hazard\u2019s final appearance in a Chelsea shirt at Stamford Bridge? Probably. Even with a transfer ban, it\u2019s unlikely that the Blues will be able to retain their star man. What a thing is would be if he could guide them to a European trophy on his way out. Hazard lines up as part of a front three with Giroud and Willian, with Pedro relegated to the bench despite his fine goal last week. That does seem to me to be the strongest XI available, without the injured Antonio R\u00fcdiger and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. Chelsea fans, what do you make of Sarri\u2019s team? Resident Blue Tom Bryant, sat next to me at Guardian HQ, says \u201cChristensen feels like an accident waiting to happen.\u201d Answers on a postcard to michael.butler@theguardian.com or @michaelbutler18. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Luiz, Emerson, Loftus-Cheek, Jorginho, Kovacic, Willian, Giroud, Hazard. Subs: Caballero, Alonso, Barkley, Higuain, Pedro, Zappacosta, Cahill. Eintracht Frankfurt: Trapp, Da Costa, Abraham, Hinteregger, Falette, Hasebe, Rode, Rebic, Gacinovic, Kostic, Jovic. Subs: Ronnow, Ndicka, Fernandes, de Guzman, Haller, Chandler, Paciencia. Referee: Ovidiu Alin Hategan (Romania) For all my puffing up of Frankfurt, they did concede six goals in 36 first-half minutes at the weekend to Bayer Leverkusen. Some players had been rested, but still \u2026 eeeeesh. With Valencia facing an uphill task to beat Arsenal in tonight\u2019s other Europa League semi-final, the chances are that Eintracht Frankfurt are the only thing in the way of another all-English European final. With dreams dashed in both Barcelona and Amsterdam, it\u2019s likely the rest of the continent will be cheering on the German side tonight in a bid to avoid what nobody is calling the Yossi Benayoun Derby (with apologies to David Rocastle, George Graham and of course, Lassana Diarra). Chelsea were the dominant side in the first leg in Frankfurt, especially in the second half, but had to make do with a 1-1 draw, with Pedro\u2019s away goal making them favourites to progress tonight at Stamford Bridge. Eintracht did however have a chance to score a second late on, but their captain, David Abraham could only nod agonisingly over from six yards. Unmarked, it was a golden chance for the Argentinian and one his side could rue. The German\u2019s biggest threat comes in the form of Luka Jovic, the Serbian striker who scored the brilliant opener last week and who you\u2019ve no doubt spent the last week watching YouTube compilations of. He\u2019s quite good. He is by no means the only threat for Chelsea. Ante Rebic, who was so brilliant for Croatia at last summer\u2019s World Cup, will partner Jovic after returning from suspension. Chelsea will be missing N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, who is out with a hamstring injury and so will need another big performance from Jorginho and Ruben Loftus-Cheek in midfield. Both were magnificent in Frankfurt last week. Despite all that, Chelsea will be expected to win tonight. But Eintracht have been defying expectations all season long and in a week of European upsets, we could well see another one tonight at the Bridge.
