Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n was briefly held in the northern city of Culiac\u00e1n last month, but was freed after hundreds of gunmen launched a wave of attacks on security forces and blocked roads with burning vehicles. The show of strength shocked even the most hardened observers of organized crime in Mexico. Ismael Boj\u00f3rquez, editor of the investigative Sinaloa weekly R\u00edo Doce described the moment as a watershed. \u201cLife goes on, yes, but not in the same way,\u201d he wrote in an editorial. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if this will now be the reaction every time criminal groups feel threatened \u2013 and we know even less what the federal government intends to do about it.\u201d But the president insists that the incident marks a turning point away from the punitive policies of his two predecessors. \u201cThis is no longer a war. It is no longer about force, confrontation, annihilation, extermination, or killing in the heat of the moment,\u201d the president said in one of the four news conferences he dedicated to the events in Culiac\u00e1n last week alone. \u201cThis is about thinking how to save lives and achieve peace and tranquility in the country using other methods.\u201d By \u201cother methods,\u201d the president \u2013 who is often referred to as Amlo \u2013 means social programmes to alleviate extreme poverty, exhortations towards good behaviour, and the insistence that he has now banned corruption. He has pledged to offer \u201cabrazos no balazos\u201d \u2013 hugs not bullets. He has also created a new militarized national police force, though this had yet to take a significant role in operations against organized crime. The problem, security experts say, is that nothing in Amlo\u2019s strategy directly addresses the terrifying power of the country\u2019s criminal underworld \u2013 which was brazenly displayed in Culiac\u00e1n on 17 October. Even before troops detained Guzm\u00e1n, convoys of heavily armed cartel gunmen were speeding to strategic positions in and around the city. The effort to rescue Guzm\u00e1n held the city hostage, but also targeted the military\u2019s weakest points, such as the buildings where soldiers\u2019 families live. \u201cWhat we saw in Culiac\u00e1n was the parallel state showing itself,\u201d said Edgardo Buscaglia, an expert on organized crime at Columbia University. Buscaglia broadly agreed with L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s critique of his predecessors, but argued that fighting poverty can not alone end criminality: many countries far poorer than Mexico suffer far less from organized crime. Instead, the government must start with a concerted strategy to dismantle the entrenched political and business interests which protect \u2013 and profit from \u2013 organized crime, he said. \u201cWhat L\u00f3pez Obrador needs is not a security strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat he needs is an anti-mafia strategy.\u201d Other critics see the operational disaster in Culiac\u00e1n as a message to criminal groups that the government does not intend to contain them. Ra\u00fal Ben\u00edtez, a security expert from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, described a litany of failures including inadequate intelligence, a lack of protection for soldiers\u2019 families and the disastrous decision to launch the arrest attempt in the middle of the day. \u201cYou need a military strategy to contain these groups \u2013 and the president is moving further and further away from one,\u201d he says. \u201cThey hadn\u2019t protected the housing because they thought there was no war. The Sinaloa cartel showed them that there is.\u201d It also remains unclear why the government attempted to seize Guzm\u00e1n in the first place, given that Amlo has frequently argued that targeting cartel leaders is a self-defeating strategy that triggers bloody power struggles. Some speculate that the operation must have been triggered by pressure from Washington: the arrest warrant followed a US extradition request, and came weeks after a DEA delegation visited Sinaloa. And yet US agencies apparently played no on-the-ground role in the mission itself, unlike in the two arrests of El Chapo himself. \u201cWe do not receive orders from Washington\u201d Amlo snapped when the issue came up in one of last week\u2019s press conferences. His response prompted a heated exchange as reporters shouted questions while the president lectured them on journalistic responsibility. Since then the atmosphere in Amlo\u2019s daily news briefing has been calmer. But many of the big questions about the Culiac\u00e1n operation remain unanswered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
