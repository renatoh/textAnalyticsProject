The unofficial National Weed Day lit up Hippie Hill in Golden Gate Park with raucous and colorful pot-themed festivities on Wednesday in what is probably the final 4/20 event before recreational cannabis becomes a reality in California. The celebration, technically a mass violation of the law and a major headache for local law enforcement, comes on the heels of scientists in the UK, US, Europe and Australia calling for a global public health campaign for marijuana, citing the serious risks of frequent cannabis use. Although most people who smoke pot do not develop psychotic disorders, international drug experts have recently argued that there was enough evidence of potential harm that governments should issue clear warnings, which have generally been lacking since the drug remains outlawed in most countries. The call from experts came in advance of this week\u2019s United Nations special assembly on global drug policy, the first in 18 years. Many San Francisco pot smokers celebrating the 20 April holiday \u2013 named after the \u201c420\u201d code for cannabis, which reportedly originated with a group of northern California teens who would meet at 4.20pm \u2013 said they weren\u2019t concerned about the warnings and health risks and were eager to support full legalization in November. A ballot measure, backed by Silicon Valley billionaire Sean Parker and widely expected to pass, would allow for the retail sale of pot for adults and comes 20 years after California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana. \u201cI smoke weed every single day. It helps me be a better person,\u201d said Tonea Barton, 20, who wore a bright green hat decorated with marijuana leaves and travels every year from Sonoma County for San Francisco\u2019s 4/20 event. If there are long-term negative health effects, she said she believes it\u2019s due to chemicals in non-organic marijuana. \u201cI highly doubt that the natural green would be bad.\u201d Barton said marijuana has enhanced her health and wellbeing. \u201cIt improves my appetite. It makes me sleep well. It\u2019s definitely more positive than negative.\u201d Her friend Miriam Ortega, 20, added: \u201cIt\u2019s been known to help a lot of people in so many different ways \u2013 children suffering from epilepsy, people with anxiety and depression.\u201d Others camped in Golden Gate Park \u2013 where vendors sold deep-fried corndogs, oversized blunts, marijuana Rice Krispies, hash products, THC syrup, hemp backpacks and other creative cannabis products and mouth-watering munchies \u2013 said they supported legalization but hope pot does not become too accessible to young people. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should go into stores,\u201d said Nancy Crawford, a 59-year-old grandmother lounging in a picnic chair next to her grandkids and other relatives. \u201cPeople do overdo it sometimes. They shouldn\u2019t smoke so much that they\u2019re falling over and passing out.\u201d Yvonne Wright, 55, said the dangers of smoking too much weed pale in comparison to the risks of painkiller addictions. \u201cPeople are taking too much Percocet and codeine. That\u2019s what doctors are giving, and people are hooked.\u201d Wright, who wore her Bob Marley T-shirt for 4/20, added, \u201cI\u2019d rather see a person high on weed than drinking all day. With weed, all you do is relax and maybe wake up hungry.\u201d At exactly 4.20pm, stoners and pot enthusiasts who were crowded into the jam-packed park simultaneously lit joints, blunts and bowls \u2013 some shouting and waving them in the air \u2013 filling the park with a thick cloud of smoke and inescapable stench of weed that spread to the surrounding area. Some civil rights activists say that the benefits of ending prohibition far outweigh any potential public health drawbacks \u2013 arguing that California is long overdue to eliminate a war on drugs that has disproportionately affected communities of color. \u201cWe\u2019re advocating social justice,\u201d said Alice Huffman, president of the California NAACP, which is backing Parker\u2019s proposal. \u201cWe\u2019ve been victimized and we have to stand up now.\u201d Since California\u2019s previous legalization effort failed six years ago, Huffman said a lot of voters who were opposed or on the fence have become supporters \u2013 many motivated by their desire for criminal justice reform and the realization that legal weed is not dangerous and should be regulated in the same way as alcohol and cigarettes. \u201cIf you look at where it was in 2010 up until now, it\u2019s like a different world,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople feel more comfortable now talking about cannabis.\u201d Huffman said she is not concerned about reports on mental health concerns, noting that until marijuana is legalized, there will continue to be a lack of comprehensive studies on the drug. \u201cThere\u2019s not been enough research for any of us to know.\u201d Keith Humphreys, professor of psychiatry at Stanford and an expert in drug policy, said that as the underground marijuana economy transitions into a legal industry, it\u2019s inevitable that usage will rise. \u201cThe price will drop potentially dramatically, and as with all commodities, when prices drop, there\u2019s increased use.\u201d Some predict that weed could eventually outsell alcohol in California. Humphreys noted that research has shown that overall increases in use tend to stem from increases in heavy use by individuals. That means people who were previously using irregularly start smoking many times a week or on a daily basis, as opposed to a surge in the total number of people using. Establishing strict regulations before the retail industry booms is critical for public health and safety, said Michelle Mello, Stanford professor of law and of health research and policy, who has written about the dangers of legal edibles. \u201cThese issues have to be thought through before legalization comes online \u2026 when you still have a little bit of leverage as a regulator and are not going to be held hostage to a powerful lobby,\u201d she said. Ultimately, the long-term public health impacts of legalization in the US remain to be seen, Humphreys said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a rapidly maturing industry making a lot of money \u2026 We won\u2019t really know the full effect of it for a long time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
