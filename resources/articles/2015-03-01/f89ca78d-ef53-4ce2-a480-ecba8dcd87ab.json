In the opening night panel for Showtime\u2019s Homeland, showrunner Alex Gansa came up with the unofficial PaleyFest motto: \u201cEvery successful TV show is a fucking miracle\u201d. In a media landscape where there\u2019s almost too much great programming \u2013 we are drowning in television miracles right now \u2013 PaleyFest convinced some of the best to sit down and give audiences a look behind the scenes on the best show that we are currently scheduling our lives around. Homeland: \u2018You\u2019ve still got to hang with her\u2019 Homeland kicked PaleyFest off with Big Brother host Julie Chen moderating. Claire Danes, always delightful, talked about the complexities of playing the often-polarising Carrie Mathison, especially this season, in which she attempted to drown her child and engaged in a questionable sexual relationship with a 19-year-old. But Danes defended Carrie : \u201c[You\u2019ve] still got to hang with her.\u201d Danes also acknowledged that she prepares to get the \u201cshit kicked out of her\u201d every year by the writers \u2014 two of whom (Alex Cary and Chip Johannessen) won\u2019t be returning for season five. Gansa gave insight into the preparation for writing the season of Homeland, a show that at times operates ahead of the news cycle. They usually go to Washington DC pre-season and see what\u2019s been talked about in terms of international relations to help inform their plotlines. Romantic plotlines for Carrie, specifically her relationship with Quinn (Rupert Friend), seemed like a tense subject among the writers. When Chen asked for a show of hands of who supported a Carrie-Quinn relationship, only Meredith Stiehm was on board. While the male writers felt that a relationship between the two could have played out very \u201chigh school romance\u201d as Alex Cary noted. However, Steihm felt that their relationship made sense because the pair understood one another\u2019s extreme life situations. She always felt at some point they should come together, not that it would be a lasting romance, but for them to find some comfort in one another. Losing James Rebhorn \u2013 the actor died last March \u2013 was a blow for the Homeland team. They wanted to make sure they honoured Rebhorn properly and discussed how to play if the character was still alive but the actor was not. Stiehm felt that the season four finale really paid tribute to Rebhorn and his time on the show, as a character and as a person. Finally, Gansa gave a teaser for season five, which will premiere in late September, may be an entirely different Homeland than the audience are used to. There\u2019ll be a two-and-a-half year jump, it will be shot in Europe and Carrie will no longer be an intelligence agent. As for other employment options for Carrie, Danes hopes that she\u2019s brewing beer rather than visiting black sites. Comedy Central: \u2018We ended just hiring our best friends\u2019 Nick Kroll aptly summed up Saturday\u2019s packed Comedy Central panel: \u201cIt\u2019s a cool time to be at Comedy Central. There was a time that wasn\u2019t.\u201d Right now, despite the impending loss of Jon Stewart, the channel is booming with Kroll Show, Broad City, Key &amp; Peele, Review and Workaholics. Moderated by Grantland\u2019s Andy Greenwald, the Comedy Central panel was a manic ball of energy with favorites interacting and riffing off one another. Origin stories of developing their shows for Comedy Central came up \u2013 Key &amp; Peele\u2019s original name would have been Jordan &amp; Keegan, which Peele noted would be too much like Kenan &amp; Kel. The Workaholics guys originally shot their show in the home that Adam DeVine and Blake Anderson actually lived in. Daly, however, was thought of for Review, since it was an adaptation of an Australian show. Everyone agreed that working with Comedy Central has been a dream. However, Greenwald asked, if despite their mostly hands-off approach, if any of them ever received weird notes from the network. The answer was yes. Peele mentioned receiving a note on whether or not people care about Star Wars to which Anders Holm defended his anti-Star Wars stance. Both Kroll and the Workaholics guys got hard passes on certain plot points (Cake Train sketch and burning American flags). In a recent Broad City episode, Ilana jerks off a tree. Jacobson mentioned that the tree semen wasn\u2019t in the script \u2014 which they would have received a note about. Anderson\u2019s most egregious note was about a plot where they were trying to go to a Rihanna concert. \u201cWe got some weird notes at first \u2014 it seems kinda gay to go to a Rihanna concert.\u201d In response Anderson said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand the force that is Rihanna. She has some dope tracks\u201d. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Daly said that he\u2019s received notes about Review being too sad. Greenwald brought up the recent New Yorker profile of Key &amp; Peele written by Zadie Smith to talk about a larger question of the relationship between friendship and collaboration that is a huge element to all of these shows. For Key &amp; Peele, who mentioned driving around together and making up songs, their friendship and constant collaboration needs a time guy \u2014 someone who will keep them in line and on schedule in the writers\u2019 room. Later, when the duo discussed some of their favorite moments which resulted in a hilarious reenactment of their Burqa Catcalling sketch (including a passionate love scene), it made one desperate to see the improvisation that happens in that writers\u2019 room. For Jacobson, for being part of a show that is such a personal project, it\u2019s easier for her and Glazer to mine the people who they already know. They worked on the web series with friends and even after reading samples from writers for their move to Comedy Central, it was better for the show to work with people they already knew. \u201cWe ended just hiring our best friends. People who we think are fucking geniuses.\u201d The Good Wife: \u2018So often powerful women have some kind of handicap\u2019 The Good Wife is another show that benefits from close collaboration. Co-creators and executive producers Robert and Michelle King have been married for 28 years and have worked together on The Good Wife for six years. The show grew from Robert\u2019s sister starting her own law firm and news stories about wronged politicians\u2019 wives. Moderator James Corden, future host of The Late Late Show, immediately went in on the loss of Will Gardner. Josh Charles, who played Gardner, had always been on a year-to-year contract when he decided to not renew. Julianna Margulies used her time as Alicia Florrick well, and managed to negotiate with Charles to stay for 15 episodes so he could get a proper (and heartbreaking) send off. For Matt Czuchry and Christine Baranski, season five and the knowledge that Charles would be leaving brought a certain kind of energy from the kick-off. Czuchry was amazed news of Will\u2019s death didn\u2019t get out before they aired. Baranski knew telling the story of Will dying would have a huge impact on both the characters and the audience of the show. \u201cI think that it speaks to the strength of what we do over the course of 22 episodes, in five years. We\u2019ve shown subtle shifts and major shifts and the audience goes with us.\u201d Perhaps, no one character has changed in so many shifts as Florrick. From the beleaguered politician\u2019s wife to a potential politician in her own right, Alicia has changed personally, along with her marriage to husband Peter (played by Chris Noth). Margulies notes that she understands why Alicia has stayed with Peter because it\u2019s beneficial for both of their careers, but that eventually she would \u201clove to see her leave Peter. She deserves a chance at real love.\u201d Alicia\u2019s complex relationship with Peter and her own evolution is a testament to how well the women are written on The Good Wife. Baranski said about her character Diane Lockhart: \u201cI love that you see her strength without the bitchiness. You see a woman who has got power and a kind of integrity but isn\u2019t necessarily unhappy at home. So often powerful women who are portrayed as worldly have some kind of handicap. There\u2019s something there that holds them back. I don\u2019t think Diane is perfect by any means but I think Alicia and Diane are strong women who have not been stereotyped as victims. It\u2019s so refreshing.\u201d Another powerful woman will be leaving The Good Wife. Archie Panjabi who plays the formidable Kalinda Sharma, announced that this would be her last season. While the Kings kept quiet on what would happen to Kalinda (they are currently on episode 19 out of 20), Czuchry feels that there will be closure for Cary\u2019s relationship with Kalinda and the opportunity for new storylines to open up . Girls: \u2018Being complex and multifaceted is the right of women on TV\u2019 It was fitting to end the first weekend of PaleyFest and celebrate International Women\u2019s Day with the Girls panel. Moderated by executive producer Judd Apatow, the panel kicked off after showing Sunday\u2019s episode early for west coast viewers \u2014 one with an unexpected twist. The twist, which had been ad-libbed by Andrew Rannells in season one, kicked off a discussion on whether or not ad libs in the script change future storylines. The answer is: not often. Executive producer Ilene Andress noted the heavy detail in the Girls scripts is similar to that of her time at The Sopranos. While The Sopranos\u2019 details were heavily food-focused, the Girls script details range from outfit to Bushwick warehouse parties to sex positions. The sex scenes on Girls have often been criticized as being gratuitous but Dunham countered that they help move the characters forward. Allison Williams, who plays Marnie, says her sex scene with Desi shows the audience exactly where Marnie is currently at. Andrew Rannells who plays Elijah, said: \u201cWe\u2019re never asked to do things that aren\u2019t organic for our characters\u201d. The depiction of sex on the show goes hand-in-hand with its politics. Dunham says she recently read an interview with herself from around when Girls first began, where she said she wasn\u2019t a very political person. A stance that she now says, she cannot relate to at all. \u201cI do care deeply about politics. About things that are happening to women, to women of color, when it comes to reproductive rights. While we don\u2019t set out to be didactic or to turn our show into a Trojan horse, the natural truth of our politics comes through in what we\u2019re doing. We tell stories about the world we live in and about the world we want to live in.\u201d Williams says that the reaction to Girls is what makes it political, that people can have conversations about the issues on the show, and see the characters themselves wrestle with what\u2019s going on in their lives. An audience question asked how Girls strikes the balance between having women characters who can be annoying while still have a feminist viewpoint. \u201cBeing complex, annoying and multifaceted is the right of women on television,\u201d Dunham replied. Dunham said that a solid writing team was essential in bringing such women to life, naming executive producer Bruce Eric Kaplan, who wrote last season\u2019s Flo, when Hannah\u2019s grandmother is dying; and Hannah and Marnie\u2019s brutal \u201cyou\u2019re the wound\u201d fight from season one. How will Girls end? Apatow has a specific ideas that executive producer, Jenni Konner described as violent and similar to Breaking Bad. Allison Williams said that putting Marnie on any hallucinogen would singlehandedly end the show. But Dunham ultimately wants to leave the girls from Girls like a campsite \u2014 better than how they found them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
