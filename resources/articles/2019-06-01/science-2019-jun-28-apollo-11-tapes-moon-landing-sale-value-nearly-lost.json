Fortunately, he decided to hold on to the three tapes labelled \u201cApollo 11 EVA\u201d, which have since been identified as the only surviving original recording of the first moon landing, in 1969. Now the tapes \u2013 which include Neil Armstrong\u2019s famous words \u201cThat\u2019s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\u201d \u2013 are to go on sale in July at Sotheby\u2019s in New York, where they are expected to fetch as much as $2m. The collection also includes footage of Buzz Aldrin walking in minimal lunar gravity, planting the US flag on the moon, collecting samples. It also shows the crew\u2019s call with Richard Nixon. George, now 65, was astonished. \u201cI had no idea there was anything of value on them,\u201d the retired mechanical engineer from Las Vegas told Reuters. \u201cI was selling them to TV stations just to record over.\u201d George thinks he sold eight reels to television stations for $50 each. It was his father who spotted the three Nasa labelled reels. \u201cHe was really into the space program and he said, \u2018I think I\u2019d hang on to those. They might be valuable someday. So, for that very reason, I pulled them out and hauled them around the country for the next 43 years. That\u2019s how come they survived.\u201d In 2006, Nasa admitted that they could not find the original video recordings of the landing. It was not until two years later, when George was on holiday with a friend who worked at Nasa, that he found out they were looking for them. \u201cQuite frankly, I was sitting at the table drinking a beer and I said, \u2018Well, damn, I have those,\u2019\u201d said George. He did not have the equipment to watch the tapes, but after he started speaking to Nasa about handing them over he was able to see the footage for the first time in a special studio in California."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
