The goal that deservedly caused their latest setback and dented their hopes of breaking into the automatic promotion places came from a header by Billy Sharp \u2013 ironically, a player Forest tried to sign when Colin Calderwood was their manager. As if to emphasise Forest's troubles in recent weeks, their striker, Garath McCleary, was sent off for a foul on John Oster. The most eye-catching Championship performances were arguably those of Plymouth, in coming from behind to win 3-1 at Barnsley, and Leicester, who thrashed Scunthorpe 5-1 \u2013 the Foxes' biggest win since they beat Sunderland 5-2 at Filbert Street in March 2000. Scunthorpe do have one of the Championship's worst defensive records, but Leicester started the day as the lowest scorers and few of their fans will have forecast this goal spree as they were without their key striker, Matt Fryatt, who suffered a fractured jaw on Tuesday. The most surprising part of the hiding they handed out to Scunthorpe was that Paul Gallagher got a hat-trick \u2013 the first of his career and his first goals in 17 matches. Peterborough, like Scunthorpe another team with a poor goals-against record, went down 1-0 at Middlesbrough due to a Barry Robson goal \u2013 his first in English football following his move from Celtic. Peterborough came agonisingly close to a late equaliser, but Josh Simpson's shot was blocked on the line by Boro defender David Wheater. It was a similarly unhappy afternoon for QPR, who lost 1-0 at Coventry and have now suffered five successive defeats. The troubled West Londoners, who have won only one of their past 14 Championship matches, had plenty of the play, but lacked a cutting edge. Irish midfielder Gary Deegan won the match for Coventry when the ball bounced off the back of his team-mate Clinton Morrison and Deegan fired in from the edge of the area. Having clinched a place in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final at Leeds United's expense, Carlisle gave their self-esteem a further boost with a 5-0 win over MK Dons. Nobody caused more problems for the Dons than Carlisle's left-winger Matty Robson, who again showed how much he has benefitted from being told to express his attacking skills more since his transfer from Hartlepool last summer. Carlisle manager Greg Abbott said: 'At Hartlepool, he was told to help out the full-back and we have to get him out of his tendency to keep doing that here. I want him to get forward and attack, and if he drops back, he knows he will get a boot right up the backside.' Others who stood out yesterday included Stockport's Jabo Ibehre, whose two goals enabled his team to earn a surprise 2-2 draw against Colchester after being two goals down. Bury's run of six successive League Two wins was ended at Chesterfield, where they missed early chances and were then punished for it through a Scott Boden header."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
