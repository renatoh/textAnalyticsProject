Saturday night marked 2,012 hours to go. (Or 1,982 according to the back of my envelope). The starter's pistols have been primed, the surface-to-air missiles are coming to a rooftop near you, and now the main stadium was receiving paying customers for the first time. At an event that, like everything else associated with this Games, sold out before you could type in your mother's maiden name, 40,000 ticketholders came to catch the last hour and a half of the British universities' athletics championships, as well as a chaotic jeux sans fronti\u00e8res that took in the north London rapper Chipmunk, the Hairy Bikers, Sporty Spice \u2013 perhaps selected because she feels at home in a track suit \u2013 and the actor Hugh Bonneville. He had got the nod less for his paternal Downton Abbey role than his recent satirical turn in BBC2's Twenty Twelve, which dwells wickedly on the internal machinery of the great bureaucratic engine of Olympic delivery. That machinery was just cranking and creaking into gear for this latest and final major \"test event\", one that culminated in the official opening of the stadium by 10-year-old Niamh Clarke-Willis, who was picked randomly out of the crowd. The X Factor promise of the evening's festivities was a contrast with the more Corinthian spirit of most of the day in which student athletes christened the pristine track. As ever, the surface has been hailed as the \"quickest\" around. It did not necessarily look so on the last lap of the university women's steeplechase. I had arrived early, to get a first proper look at the Olympic site, which is all but complete. On a grey morning the army of official volunteer greeters in hot pink and fluorescent yellow tops were testing out their foam pointy fingers and trying proper Olympic smiles for size, in what was far from beach-volleyball weather. It would be fair to say that the approach to the venue from Stratford station and the new Westfield shopping centre and car park doesn't crackle with anticipation, at least not yet; even so, the first punters were dutifully adopting Usain Bolt's golden arrow pose in front of the wavy Aquatics Centre and the towering Orbit puzzle, and trying out their Visa-sponsored clackers (which threaten to be 2012's only moderately less annoying answer to the last football World Cup's vuvuzela). The site itself still feels less the advertised \"park\" than a moated city state of varyingly futuristic buildings \u2013 the highlight of which is the splendid velodrome \u2013 surrounded on all sides by cluttered vistas of London's brownfield hinterland. Police dinghies cruised the canals; the landscaping is still growing in. Olympic pasty stalls were opening for business in advance of the two-storey McDonald's which is still in the undercooked stage. The place still, not surprisingly, feels like it is waiting to spring to full animated life \u2013 or is perhaps offering a premonition of its \"legacy\" atmosphere. \"Will they have jugglers and people on stilts and stuff, do you think?\" the child in front of me was asking his mother. It's an idea. Given that there are former track stars at every level of the organisation behind these Games, from Lord Coe down, you imagine that they will be highly conscious of timing the adrenaline flow of the Olympic and Paralympic fortnights just right. Certainly, at this test event you had the sense that the Games' organisers are anxious not to peak too soon. Athletic endeavour and light entertainment is always a slightly uneasy mix \u2013 witness A Question of Sport \u2013 and this was not an evening to disprove that rule, though the first stirrings of a summer of red-white-and-blue sentiment were to be had in the Military Wives' rendition of the national anthem. As well as putting the venue through its paces, the events of this week \u2013 that also include hockey, water polo and wheelchair tennis \u2013 offer the first proper public glimpse of the concentric rings of security that will protect the Games from terrorist all-comers. Coe and his team have been anxious in recent days to play down suggestions that the rhetoric and detail of the security operation threatens to overwhelm the fabled Olympic spirit of welcome. Responding to pictures of military manoeuvres on Blackheath Common, Coe insisted that \"we are inviting people to come to London to celebrate the greatest sporting event this country has ever seen. We are not inviting people to a siege city.\" My first Olympic experience was clearly not representative of that spirited pledge. I queued for accreditation in a long line of hired muscle in black suits bussed in from far and wide, sharp-elbowed security from Group 4 and other agencies waiting to be badged up. Those visitors who have negotiated Damian Green's Heathrow border controls may well have the opportunity to repeat the experience to gain entry to the park itself. Bag searches and belt removal and pat-downs will be mandatory; liquids and gels outlawed. Visitors are encouraged to bring their own empty water bottles which can then be filled inside the park. Once on the Olympic island, some of these anxieties about security will no doubt quickly vanish. The team of guides and stewards were warming up to give a proper British welcome to visitors \u2013 pitched somewhere likably between car park official and PTA. Though they outnumbered visitors by about three to one when I arrived, most were as happily uncertain of the stadium geography as I was. We were all finding our way, and the many conflicting directions to the media room at least offered the opportunity to lap the stadium itself a few times as the university athletes were going through their heats. It's a rather functional, understated bowl of a place, black and white ranks of seating waiting to be coloured in and brought to life by Mexican waves and tens of thousands of flash cameras. Watching the athletics itself, it was hard not to be moved by expectations of the heroic efforts the arena will inevitably witness, at least for a fortnight. Seb Coe's old purple Loughborough vest was to the fore in most of the student events, bringing to mind those heady days when the Olympian in chief glided effortlessly around the top bend to threaten national records while still an undergraduate. For the past year or two, Coe's economics degree has probably been the most useful experience of his college days, but his ability to time a finish just right should not be underestimated. Athletes have a mantra: \"Practise as if you are the worst, perform as if you are the best.\" The practice could have been worse, the main event is getting closer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
