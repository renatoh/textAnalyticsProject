After a landslide electoral victory in October, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was left scrambling to meet a campaign pledge to resettle 25,000 refugees by 31 December. McCallum conceded that only 10,000 refugees will arrive by that date, but said a further 15,000 will reach the country by the end of February, adding that the government was taking the extra time to \u201cdo it right\u201d. \u201cA smile alone is not sufficient. We want them to have a roof over their head. We want them to have support,\u201d he said. Canada\u2019s announcement stands in contrast to the alarming political rhetoric from politicians in the US, where at least 30 state governors have said they will refuse to accept Syrian refugees, and Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has described those fleeing civil war violence as a potential \u201cTrojan horse\u201d for Islamist militants. But the Liberal plan has also drawn some criticism after it emerged that single men will \u2013 at least initially \u2013 only be accepted if they were traveling with their family or could prove that they had been targeted due to their sexual orientation. The executive director of the Canadian Council of Refugees, Janet Dench, said Tuesday\u2019s announcement was \u201clong overdue\u201d. But she said she had misgivings about the exclusion of unaccompanied men, which she suggested reinforced stereotypes about Syrian men as \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d. Refugees will be vetted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and by a handful of Canadian agencies \u2013 a process the federal public safety minister, Ralph Goodale, called a \u201crobust, multi-layered\u201d verification. The refugees will be identified and processed overseas by the UNHCR and Canadian officials in Jordan and Lebanon. Those two countries will also assist in the resettlement, including by securing exit visas. Privately chartered planes \u2013 with military transport assisting if necessary \u2013 will bring them to Canada. On arrival, they will be resettled in communities across the country. Temporary housing on military bases is available for short-term housing if needed. It is estimated the plan will cost C$678m over six years. Despite initial misgivings about the fast-tracked intake from politicians in Saskatchewan and Quebec, provincial premiers have supported the government plan. \u201cThis is not a federal project, this is not even a government project, it\u2019s a national project for all Canadians,\u201d said McCallum. Trudeau\u2019s predecessor Stephen Harper had refused to accept more Syrian refugees, even after the issue became a key electoral issue when it emerged that Alan Kurdi \u2013 the Syrian boy whose body washed ashore in Turkey attracted worldwide attention \u2013 had family in Canada. During the campaign Harper\u2019s Conservative party was accused of attempting to use Muslim immigration as a wedge issue, but opinion polls have shown that Canadian attitudes towards refugees are still somewhat more welcoming than those in the US and UK. James Hollifield, an expert on refugees and immigration with the Washington-based Wilson Center, said that Canada tends to be a \u201cbig outlier\u201d compared with other western nations in its openness to accepting immigrants and refugees. Hollifield said that contrast was due to a broadly successful immigration policy, a clear demand for immigrants in the workforce, and a geography that buffers it from the effects of illegal immigration. But he warned that adding national security concerns to the ramped-up rhetoric of a US presidential election cycle had created a \u201cperfect storm\u201d to politicize the refugee debate. \u201cAnything that brings chaos, uncertainty, division in the west and pits a large Muslim community against western societies in which they have settled, that\u2019s exactly what [Islamists] want,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of politicians have taken the bait hook, line and sinker.\u201d Trudeau has called on Canadians to reject racism, but the country has seen a spike in anti-Muslim hate incidents in recent weeks. An Ontario mosque was firebombed. A Muslim woman in Toronto was attacked, punched in the stomach and verbally assaulted by two men. An Ottawa woman received a note in her mailbox with the message: \u201cCanada is no place for immigrants and terrorists. Go back home.\u201d Amira Elghawaby, with the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said that Canada has an \u201cundercurrent\u201d of Islamophobia which surfaces in the wake of events like those in Paris. \u201cA small minority of people will act on their ignorance,\u201d she said. But she said that many Canadians are ready to open their arms to the waves of refugees about to start arriving in the country next week. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing right now across Canada is an incredible groundswell of love and compassion and support for the refugees,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite incredible.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
