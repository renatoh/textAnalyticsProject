I don't want to turn it into some mystical experience or anything,\" he says, sounding a little sheepish, \"but that was the point where I thought, 'I don't want to ignore this any longer.'\" \"This\" was Macefield's idea to track down the man he calls \"the JD Salinger of rock\", La's singer-songwriter Lee Mavers, and write a book about his experiences. It was to take up the next four and a half years of Macefield's life. But, in one way, his obsession is understandable. In recent decades, rock music has been short on reclusive, \"lost\" figures. Mavers fits the bill perfectly: acclaimed as a musical genius, he has not released a record in over a decade. Depending on what stories you believe, in that time he may or may not have entered a monastery, become a heroin addict or secretly written Paul Weller's comeback hit Changing Man. In one sense, Mavers's legend rests on one song: the omnipresent 1990 hit There She Goes, later covered by US band Sixpence None the Richer and by Robbie Williams. However, the La's influence stretches far beyond their three minutes of fame. Although they formed in Liverpool in the mid-1980s, they released only one eponymous album in 1991. Endlessly re-recorded with a variety of producers at Mavers's nit-picking behest, the album allegedly cost \u00a31m to make. It was disowned by the band on release. \"We hate the album,\" Mavers told Smash Hits. \"It never captured anything that we were about.\" He claimed that the entire album would be re-recorded and released again. Instead, the La's vanished, save for a handful of sporadic and puzzling appearances during the 1990s. While La's guitarist John Power went on to fame with Britpop band Cast, his former bandmate gave a handful of chaotic live performances, including one supporting Paul Weller that ended with the plugs being pulled. There were a couple of equally peculiar interviews in the music press, during which Mavers talked in an impenetrable Scouse psychobabble. In 1995, he informed the NME that his songs \"sounded like a Nazi tank in Egypt\" and announced \"the pool is where we have to be. The Liver-pool. The Mississippi. The Mersey-sippi.\" Understandably, there were rumours of drug problems. However, there were also rumours of vast quantities of new songs, every bit the equal of There She Goes. In the eight years since that NME piece, a variety of journalists have attempted to track Mavers down, but with little success. In their leader's absence, their legend grew. The La's featured in the sort of apocryphal tales that spring up around a band who have gone into hiding. Mavers used to carry around a pouch of dust he had collected from vintage 1960s amplifiers, which he would sprinkle on instruments during recording sessions, in order to create the right \"vibe\". He had been so incensed by his record company's behaviour during a 1991 American tour that he had refused to wash or change his clothes for its duration. He had attempted to entice Pete Townshend into producing him by knocking on the Who guitarist's door and uttering the words: \"Is Pete coming out to play?\" Macefield admits from the outset that he is no journalist, and occasionally In Search of the La's resembles the sort of book that Rob Gordon, hero of Nick Hornby's High Fidelity, would write. When he finally gets to meet Mavers, Macefield's puppyish enthusiasm manages to unnerve even the La's leader, who interrupts one particularly gushing monologue with a sharp \"I'm just a man, la, just a person.\" But it's hard not to be impressed by Macefield's dedication. The La's line-up had changed so many times over the years that unearthing every ex-member proved a spectacularly onerous task. When he finally tracked them down, Macefield's interviewees were keen to debunk the myths around the band - tragically, the stuff about the pouch of 1960s dust is \"total bollocks\". Some, however, had equally peculiar tales to tell. The co-manager of the Liverpool venue The Picket claimed that the last time the La's performed there, in 1991, Mavers turned up with \"sort of 1940s radio-announcer type microphones\" and told everyone he was going to sing through them. A former guitarist, John Byrne, said that tales of Mavers's eccentric behaviour during recording sessions were not exaggerated: \"He'd have the engineers set the recording gear up in trees.\" Another former guitarist remembered that the band employed a local criminal as a roadie, who immediately proved his prowess by attempting to steal \u00a350,000 from a Scottish hotel the band were staying in. Others who had joined in the band's twilight years offered darker stories of fistfights, heroin addiction and Mavers's gradual withdrawal from the music scene, still doggedly insisting that he would re-record the band's debut album. Former bass player James Joyce remembers record company executives coming up to Liverpool in an attempt to shake Mavers out of his torpor, \"but it was obvious that these suit guys were really shocked and were going to run back to London telling tales of God knows what. And it probably wouldn't be as bad as the actual truth.\" The one thing Macefield's contacts all agree on is that the songs Mavers has written in the decade since The La's album are unbelievable. However, the only concrete evidence anyone could provide was a rehearsal tape recorded in 1998, so lo-fi that Macefield claims he could not work out where one song ended and the next began. Finally, Macefield was granted an audience with the man himself, in a nondescript semi in the Liverpool suburbs. Mavers did not much resemble the drugged-out idiot savant of popular myth. He answered the door with a baby under his arm. When he played Macefield some old La's demos, his eldest son jumped onto a windowsill and began singing along. Mavers insisted he calm down, then began chasing the boy around the sofa - hardly the behaviour of a mysterious and enigmatic figure. In fact, Macefield claims he found Mavers to be \"a warm, sensitive man, who simply wants to follow his muse without compromise\". The singer also seems charmingly aware of his own mythology, insisting that There She Goes is \"the only record in the last 10 years\" and that he will \"never do anything again\" unless a tuning problem with a favourite guitar can be fixed. He still talks about re-recording the \"shit\" La's album, but also says he might release new songs on the internet, as a means of bypassing the music industry altogether. Finally, Mavers played Macefield one of those new songs that everyone says are so wonderful. Either they are telling the truth or Macefield has been suckered into the myth of the La's himself. He claims the song, Raindance, was \"one of the best I have ever heard. Do I think the aura around him coloured my judgement? Yeah, it might have a bit. But I got that down-in-the-gut response to it. It was a great song.\" Whether anybody else will hear it, however, is open to question. Macefield's meetings with Mavers ended as abruptly as they began, with a brief telephone call, in which the singer suddenly announced that he \"didn't even want to see a book on the La's, let alone read one\". Macefield has not heard from him since, but then neither has anyone else. There have been no new songs, no gigs, no internet releases. With the devotion of a true fan, Macefield still believes that Mavers will put out another record, \"but I couldn't give you a timeframe; it could be five or 10 years.\" For the time being at least, the JD Salinger of rock appears to have vanished up the Mersey-sippi again, his mystery more or less intact. \u00b7 In Search of the La's is published on Monday by Helter Skelter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
