Dancing in the street Residents on a street in Cheshire are doing something a little bit different for their daily exercise in lockdown \u2013 a socially distanced communal dance session. Fitness instructor Janet Woodcock, 54, came up with the idea after one of her neighbours said she was missing her exercise class. For eight days now the residents of Springbourne in Frodsham have stepped out of their front doors at 11am, keeping a safe distance from one another, to do 10 minutes of exercise led by Woodcock. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple stuff, but it\u2019s about people moving, seeing one another and just having fun really,\u201d she said. \u201cOne woman told me it\u2019s the highlight of her day. Some people are working from home, but a lot of retired people just tend to be reading and watching the news all day, and it can get really depressing. So it\u2019s just nice to get people out in the fresh air.\u201d Each session starts with the Neighbours theme tune, followed by other specially chosen songs like Dancing in the Street, Our House by Madness and Tom Jones\u2019s It\u2019s Not Unusual \u2013 a street favourite. \u201cThe way it\u2019s brought us all together is just fabulous,\u201d said Woodcock. \u201cIt feels really heartwarming to see how it\u2019s helped people now, but hopefully we won\u2019t forget this. \u201cWe\u2019ve all promised a big street party when it\u2019s over and I think everybody will feel like they know each other a bit better.\u201d Singing at six Hundreds of people across the country have joined a singing movement set up by an NHS intensive care nurse to boost morale. Roxie Jackson set up Sing at Six last week to encourage her neighbours to sing some uplifting tunes after the 5pm news. \u201cEverybody sits down at five to watch that update, and the mood gets a little bit upset and people get stressed out, and I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t want to send the kids to bed in that kind of atmosphere, I want to do something happy.\u2019\u201d In just a few days the Facebook group has skyrocketed to nearly 10,000 members, with people joining in by singing together in their gardens, by video call, or posting videos, with some even dressing up. Each day Jackson sets a theme and allows group members to vote for their favourite tune. Man! I Feel Like a Woman was chosen for the 90s night and Let it Go for the Disney theme. Somewhere Over the Rainbow was the choice for a night dedicated to the elderly, with a local care home posting a video of its residents joining in. Jackson said she had been overwhelmed by the numbers of people getting involved, particularly her mum, who dons elaborate fancy dress and likes to watch the videos during her breaks at work. \u201cThe mood in the hospital has been horrible for weeks on end and now it is scary, so when you come home, you need something nice to look forward to,\u201d she said. \u201cI think music is a big thing and it\u2019s one of those things that people remember. If the kids can remember anything from this time, let\u2019s try and make it something happy.\u201d Meanwhile, a video of an elderly couple singing from their sofa during lockdown has gone viral on Facebook. Rex Taylor, 86, posted the video of him singing the wartime song We\u2019ll Meet Again with his wife Selina, 83, who has Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cWhen we are on lockdown, there is only one thing to do,\u201d said Rex, who has become the sole carer for his wife while they are isolating. Rolling with Rick Rick Astley has announced that he will be playing a free concert for NHS and emergency workers at Manchester Arena in October. The singer, whose song Never Gonna Give You Up was a worldwide number one hit in 1987, revealed the plan on social media. In a video message he said: \u201cIt\u2019s free to you guys because I just want to say a massive thank you and I don\u2019t know how else to do it. You\u2019re doing an amazing job, the whole country thanks you. \u201cI\u2019m going to work my butt off to give you a great night.\u201d Frontline NHS staff, primary care workers, paramedics, firefighters and police are all eligible to apply for free tickets, which are available from 7pm on 2 April. Attendees must present a valid ID on the night. Meals on wheels A private bus company in Blackpool has transformed an idle school bus into a pop-up shop for NHS workers. Archway Travel has created the Heroes Hamper to sell essential food supplies outside Blackpool Victoria Hospital, where the staff face long queues and empty shelves when trying to buy food outside work. The shop has been going for nearly a week and sells hampers stocked with essentials including locally sourced fresh fruit and veg, fresh bread, milk and eggs, and toilet roll. \u201cIt is a bit demoralising that we need to do this when there are so many supermarkets out there,\u201d said Sam Archer, who helps run the family business. \u201cWhen [NHS staff] have been going, there\u2019s nothing left, and they just want basic stuff.\u201d Another company that has transformed itself to benefit NHS workers is the five-star Mayfair hotel Claridge\u2019s, which has opened its doors to the dozens of medical staff unable to live at home during the coronavirus crisis. Up to 40 doctors, nurses and other key staff will move into the luxury hotel from Friday, staying in rooms that typically start at \u00a3650 a night. Paddy McKillen, co-owner of the Maybourne Group, which runs the 208-year-old hotel, said: \u201cJust as it has in the past world wars, Claridge\u2019s has a duty to step up and support the people of London. Teams from all our hotels have volunteered to help and support the dedicated NHS workers at this critical time. We are for ever in their debt.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
