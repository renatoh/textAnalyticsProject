Billed as \"a geography of sound in two acts\", his Mirror Man production is half rock and half theatre, although mercifully has more in common with David Lynch and William Burroughs than prog-era Genesis. An impressive stage set includes everything from enormous, surreal notices (\"Eat oranges and live\") to a washing machine suspended 25ft above the stage. You feel like you're in a peculiar road movie, with various characters stepping up to narrate odd tales of lonely hotels, suicides, wide open roads and the sharp end of the American dream. If it is sometimes hard to tell the characters from the musicians (brass, guitars, percussion), that's because their roles overlap. A woman serving coffee onstage for much of the first act suddenly turns out to be Linda Thompson, who later takes a starring role. It's that kind of night. There are morals in the stories (how our dreams are small, but have an enormous hold over us; consumerism; the power of the media), but these are often buried amid particularly discordant Thomas music. The second act adheres to David Thomas and Two Pale Boys' excellent new album, Surf's Up, very loosely. Andy Diagram blows his trumpet like a person banishing a bad cold; the narrator with the old BBC microphone is almost inaudible. The most compelling spectacle is Thomas himself, who is increasingly resembling a surrealist painting of Oliver Hardy. Sadly, his glorious album interpretation of the Beach Boys' Surf's Up is left to Thompson and Jackie Leven, who are good, but not the same. Mirror Man is brave and highly creative, but at an endurance-testing two hours is too often bewildering. The defining moment arrives when Thomas walks onstage for the second act to find the house lights are still on. \"I hate seeing the audience,\" he moans. \"Sometimes you look so confused.\" At Salisbury Arts Centre (01722 3203333), tonight, then tours."}, "isHosted": false}}}
