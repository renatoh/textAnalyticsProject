In an interview with the Australian following the $300m underpayment of salaried staff at Woolworths, the attorney general and industrial relations minister said that \u201cfor a substantial section of corporate Australia, they just don\u2019t get it, and the message isn\u2019t getting through\u201d. Porter\u2019s comments foreshadow a tougher response to underpayments in a future industrial relations discussion paper, after earlier statements that criminal penalties will be confined to cases of serious, deliberate and systemic wage theft. The Australian Industry Group immediately poured cold water on the proposals, noting there were already \u201cvery heavy penalties\u201d for breaches of awards and arguing giving a tribunal the power to order backpay may breach the constitution. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has lobbied the government for criminal penalties and a small claims process for the Fair Work Commission to rectify underpayments without the need to go to court. Porter told the Australian the small claims process is \u201ca good idea\u201d that would address an apparent \u201cgap in the market\u201d and allow workers to have their concerns about underpayment dealt with quickly and efficiently. Porter said the law is not currently providing effective deterrence and that if corporate Australia had its \u201ceye on the ball\u201d the spate of recent underpayments \u201cwouldn\u2019t happen\u201d. However, he said it is \u201cmonstrously unlikely\u201d big companies are underpaying workers deliberately. \u201cI accept that some awards are complicated, particularly in the restaurant and retail environments, but these are unbelievably very sophisticated organisations \u2014 Bunnings, the ABC, Maurice Blackburn, Woolies \u2014 and they have huge HR departments. \u201cThese organisations have a massive amount of time, energy and resources devoted to ensuring they don\u2019t pay a cent more tax than they have to; they get involved in sporting teams and social issues. \u201cIf they put commensurate resources into making sure they got their payrolls working in accordance with [enterprise agreements], awards and the law, they wouldn\u2019t be having this problem.\u201d Porter proposed adding to the list of directors\u2019 duties in the Corporations Act to include the responsibility to ensure their companies pay staff correctly, allowing the Fair Work Ombudsman to pursue banning orders if they failed that duty. \u201cThis would provide the real potential that directors of companies that fail to pay their staff appropriately could lose their position and the ability to hold directorships in the future for a period of time,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cAny such changes would therefore apply to directors of Australia\u2019s largest companies.\u201d AiG chief executive Innes Willox called for \u201ccalm consideration\u201d of potential changes because \u201cthe vast majority of businesses do the right thing and if errors are discovered they quickly remedy them\u201d. \u201cThe ACTU\u2019s proposal to give the Fair Work Commission the power to deal with underpayments, breaches the separation of powers in the Australian constitution as determined in the high court\u2019s Boilermakers Case in 1956,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, the high court held that the predecessor tribunal to the Fair Work Commission could not exercise judicial powers because these powers can only be exercised by a relevant court. \u201cThe commission does not have the power to order employers to make back-payments and it cannot impose penalties.\u201d In the final sitting weeks of 2019 the Coalition is set to push through its bill to increase court powers to deregister unions or disqualify their officials. One of the key union counter-arguments against the proposal was that directors of companies responsible for underpayment, such as George Colombaris, are not currently subject to disqualification. Porter can guarantee passage of the bill by making amendments to accommodate Centre Alliance while counting on the vote of Jacqui Lambie, who will vote for it because controversial unionist John Setka has refused to resign, or seek to push it through with Lambie and One Nation\u2019s support. The proposal for director disqualifications is likely to be met with scepticism by Labor, which has accused the Coalition of failing to deliver on its commitment to create a director identification number to prevent phoenixing, a process whereby businesses go broke to avoid paying worker entitlements. Labor has circulated amendments which will force the government to vote on the director identification number in parliament, but the Morrison government has repeatedly pulled the combatting illegal phoenixing bill from being debated and voted on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
