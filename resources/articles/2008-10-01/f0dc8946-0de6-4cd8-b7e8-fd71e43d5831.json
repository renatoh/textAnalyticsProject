Gerald Frederick T\u00f6ben, 64, who was en route from the US to Dubai when he was seized, was sentenced to nine months in prison in 1999 by a German court under a law that prohibits \"defaming the dead\". He was held under a German arrest warrant, issued in 2004, which alleges that he had carried out \"worldwide internet publication\" of material that was antisemitic, and denied, approved or played down the mass murder of Jews perpetrated by the Nazis during the second world war. The warrant stated that he had committed the offences in \"Australia, Germany and other countries\". T\u00f6ben appeared before Westminster magistrates court, where prosecutor Tina Whybraw said that when police boarded the plane T\u00f6ben was seen to move seat to avoid detection and told officers that \"you can't arrest me on British soil\". The court failed to establish whether he had served the sentence in Germany or had absconded before he could be imprisoned. District judge Nicholas Evans remanded T\u00f6ben in custody until tomorrow, when he will appear again. Before he was taken out of court T\u00f6ben replied: \"It's a done deal between Britain and Germany. This is an insult. I'm a teacher.\" T\u00f6ben is already awaiting the outcome of a court case in southern Australia where his privately funded Adelaide Institute is accused of publishing antisemitic material and opposing the historical truth about the Holocaust. Last year, T\u00f6ben said he had been allowed to visit London to see his son. On another occasion he had been stopped in Helsinki but was permitted to travel on to Russia to attend a conference. He is alleged to have attended a recent international conference in Iran that questioned the historical accuracy of Nazi war crimes against Jews. In a 2005 interview with Iranian state television he said: \"The Holocaust equals a lie. Therefore Israel is built on a lie.\" Wearing a black suit and peering over reading glasses, T\u00f6ben addressed the court from behind a glass screen yesterday. He did not deny who he was. \"Dr T\u00f6ben has been caught in London,\" he said. He objected to the terms of the warrant, claimed that Britain should not be able to hand him over because it was not in the Schengen agreement and said he had been slandered for his views. He said he was on a research trip to South Africa, where he was hoping to interview a descendant of Napoleon about whom he was planning to write a book. \"Jewish groups in Australia,\" he said, were \"trying to close down the Adelaide Institute website.\" He said he had sought permission from the court in Australia before leaving the country. \"This is an abuse of process. This is a legal ambush. It's not British law where the individual still has freedoms,\" he told the court. \"It's a witch-trial mentality in Germany concerning this matter. I was under the impression that if I transited [the UK] I would be fine. There was no reason for me to suspect that anything should happen to me. \"The Schengen agreement protected me. Britain has not the Holocaust denier laws that Germany has so they are slipping [this offence] in as a race hatred and cybercrime.\" He pleaded with the district judge that he should be released and not sent on to Germany. \"I beg you to let me leave the country, to kick me out, I promise never to return.\" Objecting to bail, the prosecutor said that T\u00f6ben could face up to five years in prison for the offence and was likely to abscond if freed from the court. His passport had numerous foreign visas and travel stamps in it, from Zimbabwe, China, Iran, Germany and others, Whybraw said. Born in Germany in June 1944, T\u00f6ben is the author of eight books. After completing a PhD at the University of Stuttgart in 1977, he taught at secondary schools and colleges in New Zealand, Germany, Rhodesia and Nigeria."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
