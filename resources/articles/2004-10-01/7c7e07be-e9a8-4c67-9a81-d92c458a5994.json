The shares closed down 45p, a drop of nearly 20%, at 200p, wiping more than \u00a3100m off the value of the company. That included a \u00a339m decline in the personal fortune of the chain's founder and chairman, Dave Whelan. JJB, which on October 1 revealed it had received an approach, has consistently refused to identify the would-be bidder. Speculation focused on the private equity group Cinven. Yesterday the 438-store chain's chief executive, Tom Knight, said the approach never moved beyond an initial meeting and the suitor had not started due diligence work. \"They had one conversation early on and they then had some discussions with our advisers. The information we had from that was that they felt they couldn't make an offer at an appropriate price.\" JJB, he insisted, had not named a price: \"We didn't mention any figure at all ... That would indicate that we are putting the company up for sale and that is not the case.\" Analysts had expected a bid of about 260p, valuing the business at \u00a3600m, but some said they did not believe Mr Whelan would accept less than 280p. Mr Knight said the chairman, who tried to take the chain private last year with a 220p offer which was blocked by the non-executives, was not present at any takeover discussions. He added that Mr Whelan had not named a price he would accept for his own stake \"either formally or infor mally\", but conceded: \"The chairman would be the first one to say that everything has its price.\" He said press reports forced the company to issue a statement to the stock exchange confirming the takeover approach. There was \"constant paper talk\" about JJB. The chain has been struggling against increased competition, especially from Tesco, Asda and Argos, and in July was forced into a profit warning. JJB, which generates half of its sales from fashion, footwear and replica shirts, blamed bad weather. Yesterday's first-half results showed a 15% dip in sportswear sales which were not offset by increased replica kit sales. Profits were down to \u00a328m. JJB said the agony was not over. Like-for-like sales in the first 11 weeks of the second half were down 0.6% on last year and the group still has half of its excess summer stock to shift, which Mr Knight reckons will take another eight weeks. He remains upbeat, insisting his chairman is equally fired up about prospects for the company. \"Dave is as aggressive at 68 as he was at 48. He is still very, very keen to grow the business.\" Mr Knight pointed to the success of the group's new health clubs, with sports stores on mezzanine levels. It operates 18 and plans another 16 in the coming year. The clubs, in out-of-town retail parks, charge \u00a335 a month and include a gym, swimming pool, studios and bar. He confirmed that JJB has not ruled out another appeal against the Office of Fair Trading's finding that the retailer, along with others, was guilty of fixing the price of replica soccer kit. An appeal against the \u00a38.4m fine imposed is under way. \"We are just not guilty,\" Mr Knight said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
