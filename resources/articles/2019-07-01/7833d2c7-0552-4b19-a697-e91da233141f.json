What they got was a pop quiz: and an easy one at that. Despite slow patches in the second half, the reigning champions passed with flying colours, winning 74-25 in a lopsided contest. But they have an exam to sit on Thursday and coach Lisa Alexander would have undoubtedly preferred a sterner test from the world No 6. Earlier, Noeline Taurua\u2019s Silver Ferns crushed Northern Ireland 77-28, leaving the Kiwis, like the Australians, unbeaten in five matches in as many days. Neither side has a true measure of where they\u2019re at though, having recorded double-digit margins every game. The arch rivals \u2013 who have won or placed second at 11 of the 14 World Cups \u2013 now face-off in a mouth-watering battle on Thursday. While the trans-Tasman rivals are both likely to advance to the semis regardless of the result, it\u2019s a match fans have been waiting for since the Ferns\u2019 spectacular fall from grace at last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games, where they didn\u2019t medal for the first time. Winning may set up a run for the title or a loss could galvanise a team, as happened at the 2015 Cup in Sydney. Then, the Kiwis beat Australia early in the tournament in what has gone down as the \u201cpoking the bear\u201d match. That loss spurred the Diamonds all the way to the trophy. In Liverpool, the Malawi Queens were outrun and outclassed by a Diamonds outfit which had to generate its own momentum after quarter-time, when the game was all-but won with the scoreboard at 21-2. Australia\u2019s starting line was captain Caitlin Bassett at shooter, who came into the match with 92% accuracy and Gretel Tippett at goal attack. Paige Hadley started at wing attack and Liz Watson took centre. With April Brandley missing after injuring her ear during the Barbados match, Jo Weston started at goal defence, with Courtney Bruce at keeper and Jamie-Lee Price at wing defence. Keeping Malawi to a tournament-equal low of just two goals, Australia made a sharp start in the first, with Bassett scoring 14/14 and Tippett 7/7. Hadley looked keen to impress and had eight feeds. Under suffocating defensive pressure, the Queens managed just three in the second, while the Australian shooters and a rampaging Watson continued to dominate. The quarter ended 41-5, with the Diamonds having caused 24 turnovers. Alexander made a raft of changes at half-time, leaving just Bruce, Watson and Price from the starting seven and it took a while to settle. Meanwhile, Malawi put on nine goals, most care of new shooter Sindi Simtowe. After a slow start, Caitlin Thwaites and Steph Wood picked up where Bassett and Tippett left off, scoring 14/14 and 6/6 respectively, with good service from Kelsey Browne. It was 61-14 at the last break. In the last, the Diamonds scored just 13 as the Queens managed 11; something to work on. After the New Zealand game, Australia will face England or South Africa in a semi-final later in the week. It\u2019s game on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
