The establishment of an independent adjudicator to replace the archaic system of university \"visitors\" to hear appeals - they range from the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh to a number of bishops and Lady Mary Archer, wife of the disgraced Tory peer - is at last about to happen after years of criticism and debate. It is being warmly welcomed by students. At present a student at any of the old universities who is dissatisfied with a decision of the authorities can appeal only to the visitor and is denied recourse to the courts (unlike students in the new universities). The system had come under increasing criticism for being cumbersome and last week a case in the high court involving an Aston University student signalled that visitors might be on their way out as a result of the Human Rights Act. Ministers had become increasingly impatient at the apparent slow progress by universities on setting up an ombudsman, while vice-chancellors feared that a voluntary system without statutory backing would be undermined by students appealing to the courts. In the white paper on higher education, ministers promised to legislate for an independent adjudicator, but in the meantime the universities have agreed to set one up voluntarily. The great majority of both old and new universities and higher education colleges are understood to have signed up. Advertisements for an adjudicator and a deputy will soon be placed as the first step towards setting up an office in London with four case officers. A shadow board, chaired by Professor Norman Gowar and including representatives of vice-chancellors in England and Wales, college principals and the National Union of Students, is overseeing the project until a company is incorporated to run the adjudicator's office. The adjudicator's decisions will be recommendations and will not lessen the rights of students to go to court. \"But we hope that in the majority of cases both the institution and the individual will accept the decision,\" said David Anderson-Evans, policy adviser to Universities UK, which represents the vice-chancellors. Most cases will be dealt with on paper although the adjudicator will have the power to hold hearings. Academic judgments will not be a matter for the ombudsman, but he or she will deal with unfair marking and exam procedures or complaints of bias against a student. Accommodation and support services will also be covered. He guessed there would be about 300 cases a year, although it was possible that the introduction of a cheap and straighforward way of complaining might lead to a big increase. However, the publication of the adjudicator's reports might in time deter hopeless cases, he added. \"It is something we have been campaigning about for about 20 years,\" said NUS vice-president Chris Weavers. \"Doing casework on a daily basis we see all too clearly the inadequacy of the visitor system in terms of cost and speed and also whether they are perceived as independent from the institutions. The current system is unworkable.\" He added: \"I think there will be more complaints because it will be a more practical system to use but hopefully as institutional complaints procedures improve the numbers of appeals will drop.\" Rami Okasha, president of NUS Scotland, welcomed the promise of an ombudsman by Labour and Liberal Democrats in their agreement to form a new executive. \"To the many students who find that they have a genuine problem on their course which can't be solved internally, the ombudsman offers a glimmer of hope. Someone impartial will be able to investigate whether they are getting fair treatment - at the moment most students have nowhere to turn to.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
