There is one chap in his mid-70s who we see at events on a regular basis \u2013 and it\u2019s not Mick Jagger, who was spotted partying at south London spot Horse Meat Disco last month. We are not alone. A poll of 2,000 adults by the ticket platform Eventbrite found that 2.6 million Britons over the age of 45 go clubbing at least once a week and 40% say they have more stamina than ravers half their age. Part of it is that the clubbing population has aged and they are continuing to go to the events. I started raving in the late 80s, when you\u2019d turn up at a service station, follow the leader around the motorway and end up at an abandoned barn somewhere in the middle of nowhere. I stopped going in my late 40s, about the time I met Tonia and moved in with her and her four-year-old son. She was also caring for her father, so we didn\u2019t do a lot of the going out together that most couples do at the start of a relationship. One of the events I used to go to was the Gatecrasher night in Sheffield. In 2016, they had a 23rd anniversary event, and Tonia agreed to come. She had done a lot of clubbing, so she wasn\u2019t averse to the idea of going out dancing all night. For me, it was like coming home. It\u2019s a very welcoming, warm atmosphere and I didn\u2019t feel awkward being one of the oldest people there. People usually ask me how old I am, then tell me that I\u2019m inspirational and that they hope they\u2019re still enjoying partying when they\u2019re my age. It\u2019s lovely, but it can be a bit of a nuisance when what would be a three-minute walk between rooms takes 20 minutes because so many people want to talk to us. A night out is also exhausting. A typical event will last eight or nine hours. We pace ourselves and we\u2019ll dip in and out and drink plenty of water. But the music and atmosphere energises me. I couldn\u2019t run a mile, but this gives me loads of exercise. Since I\u2019ve been going, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s contributed to me losing more than five stone. I love the music \u2013 trance in particular tends to be quite melodic. There will be a point in the tune where it gets a little bit floaty, then it builds up and there\u2019s a great big wallop, and it\u2019s very hard for me to stand still for it. But mostly I love it because of the people \u2013 we\u2019ve made friends from all over the world through it. When we got married last year, we hosted a trance event in a local club. When I was younger, as long as the music was reasonably fast and I could jump up and down to it, I wasn\u2019t that picky. Nowadays, I tend to go more to the trance nights because I think a whole event of hardcore \u2013 which has a really fast tempo \u2013 would actually kill me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
