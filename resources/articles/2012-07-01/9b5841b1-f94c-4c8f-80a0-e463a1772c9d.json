The furlong, which is one-eighth of a mile, has been abandoned as the unit of race distance in Australia, the Far East and the rest of Europe, but remains in everyday use in the sport in Britain, Ireland, the United States and Canada. Wednesday's meeting at Sandown will see furlong-markers adorned with references to the number of metres to the finish, while the racecard will show jockeys' weights in kilogrammes, alongside the traditional stones and pounds. Racing For Change is promoting the trial as part of an initiative aimed at making the sport more accessible to younger audiences and to Olympics tourists, who might - it somewhat hopefully imagines - go racing at Sandown, Epsom or Kempton in the weeks ahead. An extension could theoretically be considered later this year despite the general antipathy offered by racecourse punters to a similar experiment with decimalised odds in 2010. However, RFC chief executive Rod Street stressed that the furlong would remain part of the racing landscape for the foreseeable future. \"On a personal level, I think the furlong is one of those things that makes racing special and unique, but at a time of the year when we do expect to see more families and some international visitors coming racing, we thought it a worthwhile experiment,\" he said. Frankie Dettori helpfully saw the benefits too, saying: \"This is a great idea when so many tourists will be visiting Britain for the Olympics. In Italy, I grew up with metrics so it's second nature to me, as well as to my kids, but I can understand why they're running them side-by-side since many racegoers are happier with Britain's Imperial measures.\" Last season's Champion Hurdle hero Rock On Ruby will have a new trainer but remain in the stable next season after 25-year-old Harry Fry, who supervised the satellite yard from where the horse was trained under the flag of Paul Nicholls last season, announced that he plans to take out a trainer's licence in October. Fry said: \"I hope to have about 20 in training next season, including Rock On Ruby, and can't wait to get started. Paul has been very supportive of my decision and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for all his help and advice over the years.\" Bookmakers, who eased Nicholls' price to retain his jump trainers' championship in light of the news, were also busy cutting the odds of Richard Hughes in the Flat jockeys' title race. Having been available at 4-1 at the start of last month, William Hill now make Hughes favourite ahead of long-standing market leader Ryan Moore at 10-11. Meanwhile, racing's battle to maintain its share of betting shop turnover was dealt a potential blow by a report from a parliamentary select committee encouraging the government to lift restrictions on the number of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) allowed in each betting shop where local authorities believed that the four-per-shop maximum was encouraging the proliferation of betting shops within small areas. FOBTs and their guaranteed win percentages have become an increasingly lucrative earner for high street bookmakers in recent years with the big names such as William Hill and Ladbrokes reporting that they account for nearly 50% of retail profits. Critics of the machines regard them as more dangerously addictive than traditional forms of betting-shop gambling. However, the British Horseracing Authority's desire to secure new Levy-replacing commercial relationships with bookmakers that would see part of their profits on racing guaranteed for the sport puts them in a slightly difficult position - keen to protect racing's market share, but reluctant to directly criticise future potential partners. Will Lambe, the BHA's head of external affairs, admitted that racing would \"have concerns\" over a possible increase to the four-per-shop maximum but stressed that the committee were offering nothing more than recommendations. \"Racing has long sought to move to a relationship with the betting industry that is mutually beneficial and sees our commercial interests aligned. It is natural that in such an environment we would want the British betting industry to thrive, but at this stage we do not see a justification for any increase in FOBT numbers,\" he said diplomatically. Lambe added that the benefits to the sport of forthcoming changes to legislation that will see offshore bookmakers regulated at the 'point of consumption' and taxed accordingly were of greater financial significance. \"Legislation on this matter cannot come soon enough for racing and for all concerned,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
