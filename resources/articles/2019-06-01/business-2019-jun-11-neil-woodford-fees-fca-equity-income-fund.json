Woodford, who last year paid himself and his business partner \u00a336.5m, said he would continue to collect the fees despite the intervention of Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and Nicky Morgan MP, the chair of the Treasury select committee. Bailey said Woodford, who was once the City\u2019s best-known stock-picker, \u201cshould should consider very seriously \u2026 his position\u201d. Morgan said: \u201cOthers have suspended taking fees and I think Woodford should too, for the sake that I think that it\u2019s something like \u00a3100,000 a day, potentially, in fees. \u201cI mean, that is a huge amount of money and, as I say, there are investors who have put often, sometimes, their life savings or certainly money needed for important investments [in the fund]. And they\u2019re watching that value drop.\u201d A spokesman for Woodford Investment Management, which once held more than \u00a310bn but is now worth less than \u00a34bn after large investment losses and outflows of cash, said: \u201cThe company will continue to charge the fee as the fund remains actively managed and we focus on repositioning the portfolio.\u201d James Anderson, the manager of Scottish Mortgage, a FTSE 100 investment trust, said it was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d that Woodford was not waiving fees while dealings were suspended. He said fees are \u201cone of the ethical issues that are under your control\u201d. Woodford apologised to investors for a second time on Tuesday, telling them in a letter sent via brokers, that he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the \u201canxiety that the suspension has caused you\u201d. \u201cI realise this will be concerning and frustrating to you and I am sorry for putting you in this situation,\u201d he added. But Woodford defended his investment strategy, and said: \u201cIn my view, every position within the portfolio will continue to be united by one thing: under-valuation. Every asset in the portfolio has a fundamental value that significantly exceeds its share price. In some cases, in my judgement, the gap between value and price is as wide as I have ever seen in more than 30 years of public equity market investing.\u201d The fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown, which sold and promoted Woodford products, has dropped its platform fees for clients affected by the suspension. Hargreaves said it was not fair to charge customers while they were barred from trading. Hargreaves is itself facing intense scrutiny from the FCA and MPs over its role in promoting Woodford\u2019s fund in its influential \u201cWealth 50\u201d ranking of favourite funds. Bailey said the FCA would \u201clook again\u201d at fund supermarkets including Hargreaves to ensure they were impartial. The FCA investigated best-buy lists in March but did not introduce new rules. Morgan has demanded that Bailey publish details of his contact with Woodford and that he confirm whether the City watchdog was planning a formal investigation into the events that led to the fund\u2019s suspension. She said the debacle raised concerns that the FCA may have been asleep at the wheel as the fund manager tumbled into crisis. Bailey will face Morgan\u2019s Treasury select committee for a public grilling on 25 June. Morgan demanded on Tuesday that Hargreaves explain its inclusion of Woodford\u2019s fund in its Wealth 50 list. Hargreaves only removed Woodford Equity Income from the influential list when it froze withdrawals last week. She also asked the Hargreaves boss, Chris Hill, how much money the firm had made in fees from customers who had invested in Woodford\u2019s fund. At the end of March, Hargreaves\u2019s customers accounted for about \u00a32bn of \u00a310.6bn under Woodford\u2019s management. Hill said: \u201cWe have received the letter of the chair of the Treasury select committee and will reply in due course.\u201d The FCA also hit out at Woodford\u2019s skirting City rules on holdings in privates companies by listing them on the Guernsey stock exchange. Doing this allowed him to stay with EU rules that limit the proportion of unlisted or illiquid investments to no more than 10% of assets. Bailey said that while the move was \u201callowable\u201d and \u201cwithin the rules\u201d he disapproved of Woodford\u2019s tactics. \u201cI\u2019ve said publicly I don\u2019t think it is right. I think investors should be able to determine where their assets are held,\u201d he said. But the Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent came to the defence of the FCA during a parliamentary hearing on Tuesday, saying regulators shouldn\u2019t be expected to safeguard investors to the point where they faced no risks. \u201cYou cannot have a system which collectively could reduce all risk to zero. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s desirable. There is risk in these funds, there is risk in risky assets.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
