All my gigs were cancelled, and so time takes on a different quality. There\u2019s something about all of this music I\u2019m listening to that speaks to us slowing down \u2013 that speaks to this vacuum of urgency. It\u2019s peaceful, serene, disembodied music to kind of get lost in. The Italian ambient composer Gigi Masin is music for any time. I love sweet music that isn\u2019t saccharine. Most music is just corny, and this edges towards that \u2013 there\u2019s this really amazing moment before something slips into being bad taste. It doesn\u2019t do full throttle with emotion and it\u2019s more powerful as a result. All the things that are left unsaid ... it has a wistful quality is really powerful. That\u2019s completely subjective, though, someone might listen to Masin and think it\u2019s corny as fuck. Playing Piano for Dad by H Hunt has this really beautiful cut-up feel, as if somebody was just sitting at the piano and trying to remember some jazz standards they learned as a teenager. They keep tripping, trying to figure it out over and over again. That process element is really nice \u2013 I love making recordings with audible damper pedal sounds, key sounds, the sounds of adjusting your chair. It\u2019s very tactile, sensual music. Morton Feldman\u2019s Triadic Memories, and Eliane Radigue\u2019s Trilogie de la Mort \u2013 they\u2019re so easy to fall into. It\u2019s deceptively charming music, even though it has a lot of dissonance. I love the empty spaces in Triadic Memories. There\u2019s something really powerful when the notes punctuate the space, and in how beautiful the decay of each of the notes can be. Trilogie de la Mort you can get lost in. It reminds me of David Lynch\u2019s obsession with electricity, it has that kind of spiritualised voltage feeling. I\u2019m also listening to Chee Shimizu and Charlie Bones\u2019s NTS radio shows. I love the communal aspect of Charlie\u2019s show, when people call in and have to sing the tune that they want to hear. I have my comfort albums, too: Newworldaquarium\u2019s The Dead Bears; Rhythm &amp; Sound\u2019s With the Artists. The through line with all this stuff is that it\u2019s intimate music; it\u2019s personal to me, or comforting. There\u2019s this element of human touch, or that feeling of getting lost in time, and that is all super relatable to the current moment. \u2022 Laurel Halo\u2019s score for the film Possessed is released 10 April on The Vinyl Factory"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
