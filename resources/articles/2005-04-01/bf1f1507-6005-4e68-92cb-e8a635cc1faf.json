Confusingly they are managing at this moment to stage an internal dispute in which each of the main protagonists is called Howard. And now it emerges that they no longer want broadcasters to call them Tories. Although it originally referred to Irish outlaws, this title has long been borne with equanimity and quite often claimed with pride, particularly on the now faded paternalist High Tory wing of the party. Now it seems they assume that the term is one of the reasons why people don't like them, though it has to be said that its association with troublesome Irishmen was probably known to less than 1% of electors before they began to bang on about it this week. Yet a party which makes a request of this kind ought to be very clear which alternative title it wishes to be adopted. Broadcasters might be able to manage with the full designation Conservatives, but that fails to fit the requirements of newspapers. Headlines demand something snappier. Take any one of the head lines in this week's papers which uses the words Tory or Tories and imagine the difficulties that it would cause if the word Conservative had to be squeezed into such limited space. It would reduce the print size, which they would have welcomed this week, but whatever broadcasters do, Tories in print media will stick. The party formed by the Liberals and most of the old SDP learned this lesson early on when they tried to call themselves the Social and Liberal Democrats and were cruelly abbreviated to Salads. Lib Dem has been a good enough headline term to save them from further embarrassment. Some supporters would like the Conservatives to call themselves The Democrats, which would shorten neatly to Dems, the Progressives (Progs) or Moderates (Mods). As it stands, though, majority party opinion wants to stick with the designation Conservative, so the only obvious alternative short form to calling them the Tories at present is to call them the Cons. Even Michael Howard and Howard Flight would surely unite against that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
