The story of the many Wellingtons is reduced to one, LN 514, built from scratch in under 24 hours as part of a filmed propaganda stunt. The surviving workers from the Vickers-Armstrongs factory in Broughton are reunited to watch the film and remember what they did, and the men who flew the Wellingtons recall the plane's astonishing durability. Valuable context is provided by Max Hastings, whose book on Bomber Command should be the next stop for the curious. The Young Ones 9pm, BBC1 Celebrity pensioners Derek Jameson, Dickie Bird, Sylvia Syms, Kenneth Kendall, Liz Smith and Lionel Blair move into a 1970s time capsule house to re-enact a scientific experiment. Can living in the past significantly improve their cognitive ability and physical health by tricking their brains into thinking they're 35 years younger? Sounds odd, but apparently it's worked before. It's difficult viewing though, as we watch once-sprightly stars struggling to climb stairs and negotiate life without the help they're used to. First Light 9pm, BBC2 Pilot Geoffrey Wellum was just 18 when he joined 92 Squadron in May 1940. In a few short months, he became a combat veteran as he flew mission after mission, pitting his Spitfire against the Luftwaffe. First into the air in the BBC's Battle Of Britain Season, First Light is a drama-documentary based on Wellum's memoirs. The airborne sequences are stunning, and give at least some insight into why Wellum, now 89 and still haunted by his memories, succumbed to combat fatigue. 1960 \u2013 Year Of The North 9pm, BBC4 After having the good grace to power industrial Britain, the 1960s provided northern Britain with a chance to speak in its own voice rather than the plummy vowels of the BBC. This Timeshift film ties together the birth of commercial TV at Sidney Bernstein's Granada, the books of Keith Waterhouse and Alan Sillitoe and the films of their work that made stars of Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. It's a fascinating look at a period that produced some of the great moments in modern British culture. Sons Of Anarchy 11.05pm, Five USA A double-length episode to tie up the first season and lay a few cliffhangers to make season two as unmissable. Clay and Tig's cover-up of Donna's death isn't standing up to close scrutiny. The already deeply disillusioned Jax seems perpetually on the verge of spilling the beans to his lifelong friend Opie, but this would mean the end of the Samcro biker gang. As usual, it's up to the women who support this boys' club, Gemma and Tara, to steer their men on the right course. An episode that fully delivers the payoff the show has been so expertly building towards. This Is England '86 10pm, Channel 4 Let's talk about sex, baby: the common denominator underpinning much of episode two. Bawdy sex, interrupted sex and, in Milky's case, dangerous sex. As Lol (Vicky McClure) deadpans, \"Maybe we should talk about our infidelity, for a bit of light relief.\" Poor Lol's got enough on her plate already, including the nightmare flat Woody's moved them into, and the return of her errant dad. Wonderful stuff, full of memorable lines like, \"When my Colin walked out on me last year, I practically lived on pig's trotters.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
