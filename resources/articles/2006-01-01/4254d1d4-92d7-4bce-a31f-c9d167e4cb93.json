The Football Association of Ireland's decision ends a three-month search after opting not to renew Brian Kerr's contract following his failure to guide Ireland to this summer's World Cup finals. A host of high-profile names had previously been linked with the vacancy, most notably Martin O'Neill, Sir Alex Ferguson and Terry Venables. But the FAI have instead opted for an unlikely double act in Staunton - Ireland's most-capped player with 102 appearances to his name - and Robson. \"I'm delighted and proud to be appointed Irish international team manager\", said Staunton. \"I know that the calibre of the team I have will bring a huge range of experience and talent to the challenges that lie ahead; I can't wait to get started\", he said. \"I hope that the drive, passion and commitment that we have can reflect the Irish fans' real love for the game and have an impact not just on the squad but on the nation\". Due to Staunton's lack of managerial experience, Robson will help provide a guiding hand to the 36-year-old Staunton, alongside new coach Kevin MacDonald, who retains his role as Aston Villa reserve-team manager, and former Republic No1 Alan Kelly, who assumes the role of goalkeeping coach. \"I am really looking forward to working with the new manager and his team,\" added Robson. \"Stephen's record and reputation speak for themselves and I am delighted to help and advise him in any way he sees fit. I am totally confident that Irish team has a really bright future.\" Commenting on the appointments, FAI chief executive John Delaney said: \"Stephen has impressed people for many years with his attitude, commitment, dedication and his unrivalled knowledge of the dressing room. He is highly respected, a natural motivator and I am confident he will make an excellent manager.\" Of Robson's role, he added: \"Bobby brings a magnificent wealth of experience in addition to his renowned passion and enthusiasm for the game. His knowledge, experience and advice will be a valuable asset to Stephen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
