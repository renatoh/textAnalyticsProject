How do you become one of them?", "bodyText": "A recent study by Queen Mary University of London referred to surveys that showed only 2% of actors make a living from the profession and that 90% are out of work at any one time would be sufficient to have most aspiring thespians reaching for the scotch, if only we could afford a drink in the first place. It has always been a notoriously tough old game, but with so many actors and so few jobs nowadays, it\u2019s harder than ever to get by. The old regional repertory theatre system that existed in my day has largely disappeared. Everything now is either loaded down with established stars to ensure ratings, or last-minute scraps: \u201cOne scene as a cop, filming on Friday, \u00a3500, no repeat fees.\u201d If there is any cold comfort in these findings, it\u2019s that the same 2% tend to work most of the time, and the remaining 98% hardly at all \u2013 so the trick is to make sure you\u2019re in the 2%, and if you\u2019re not, to get out before it\u2019s too late, and the profession eats up your best years. The defining difference between amateurs and those who choose to pursue it as a career isn\u2019t talent, but simply that professionals are prepared to endure the daily ritual of humiliation, rejection, financial anguish and grinding unemployment. You have to be tough. Getting into a good drama school is a great help \u2013 at least you have a chance of being noticed. But there are now hundreds of drama schools, and despite their sleek prospectuses, none but the top four or five will be of any use in furthering your chances. Nowadays many actors have a subsidiary profession they can fall back on \u2013 designing websites, working in bars, or even delivering sandwiches. But unless you\u2019re careful you can find your backup becomes your main occupation. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, and don\u2019t be late\u201d is still the best advice I\u2019ve been given. But if you really, really need a job, here\u2019s how to get one. Book a once-in-a-lifetime, non-refundable holiday. The phone will ring the moment you\u2019ve committed your funds, promise. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 June 2019. An earlier version was wrong to say that a recent study by Queen Mary University of London showed 2% of actors made a living from the profession, and that 90% were out of work at any one time. Those figures were referenced in the study, but were not from the study itself, which looked into predicting success in show business. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
