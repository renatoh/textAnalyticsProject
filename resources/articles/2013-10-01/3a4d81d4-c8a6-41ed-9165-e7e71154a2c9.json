Nine Tales of the Pendulum is full of testaments to Coady's broad world-music experience, and bop-sax empathy through his regular association with Peter King \u2013 in passages such as the two-sax theme statement of Autumn, the asymmetrical piano hook and stealthy sax theme of Naturally Liberating Molecules, or the contrapuntalism of Enemies of Order and unison chorus of Skimpy, in which Binney and Irish tenor saxist Michael Buckley border on a contemporary equivalent to the famously articulate pairing of Lee Konitz with Warne Marsh. But there are also slow-blossoming pieces like the lovely 64 Claudio Coello, and double-takers such as Abyss, which begins with a subtle Neame intro and a Stan Getzian smooch from Buckley, but turn eventually to something throbbing and almost sinister. The quality of the writing suggests the long wait for Coady's album debut has been time well spent, but with Binney, Buckley and Neame as the principal melody improvisers here, it's inevitably the playing that steals the show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
