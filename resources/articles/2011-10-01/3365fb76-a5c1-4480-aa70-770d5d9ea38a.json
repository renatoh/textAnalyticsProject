Do not read on if you haven't seen episode five \u2013 and if you have seen further in the series, please be aware that many UK viewers have not. Read Paul Owen's episode four blog Each series of Curb your Enthusiasm has a theme (Larry opens a restaurant, Larry stars in The Producers), and I had been looking forward to seeing what twist of fate would send Larry back to his hometown of New York for this one. But when Larry was finally uprooted this week, five episodes in, it was on the flimsiest of pretexts: avoiding helping a friend with a benefit for disabled kids. Crucially, it wasn't that funny either while the excuse Larry gave Tessler for leaving town \u2013 \"Jerry and I are working on a new show\" \u2013 gave a frustrating glimpse of a much more interesting plotline that might have been. On top of that, this episode did not seem to hang together very well. It didn't really make sense for the vet's wife to get so offended when Larry answered her question about \"jacking off\", and the whole \"vow of silence\" plotline seemed a bit forced. But mainly it just wasn't funny enough. I think I only laughed once, at Tessler's crass comment about working with special-needs children: \"You look at these kids, and you feel so complete \u2026 if only by comparison.\" Best line: I also liked Richard Lewis's response when Larry told him he was going to the vet to see Jeff's dog, Oscar. \"You should just let him take care of it. What are you, Dr Doolittle?\" Larry in the right: I supported Larry 100% over people parking outside the lines, and I liked his comment to a woman trying a \"chat and cut\" to get to the front of a queue: \"Ninety-nine times out of 100 that's gonna work. Unfortunately I happen to be on the line.\" And he was dead right that a plan is a plan and doesn't need a confirmatory phone call. Larry in the wrong: But then he ruined it all by chatting and cutting too, and failing to turn up to meet Lewis as planned. And as for eating a dying dog's frozen yoghurt \u2026 that was a new low."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
