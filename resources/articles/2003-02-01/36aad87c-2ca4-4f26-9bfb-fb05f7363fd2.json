Simone Martel, who organised the \u00a31.2m ceremony at the New York Plaza Hotel in November 2000, told Mr Justice Lindsay a complicated and expensive security operation was devised from day one to keep out uninvited guests. The operation involved three security companies and the New York police and fire departments. \"We worked on the basis that paranoia is the mother of survival and tried to plan for as many contingencies as possible,\" Ms Martel told the court via a video link from New York. Ms Martel, who described her job as \"event planner\", said the Hollywood couple had wanted their wedding to be \"personal, romantic, intimate and unforgettable\". Ms Zeta Jones, born in Swansea, wanted a Welsh male voice choir, which Ms Martel hired from Pennsylvania. Everyone involved with the wedding - including the staff, florists, caterers, choir and the 350 guests - were asked to sign a confidentiality agreement. The day before the wedding Ms Martel hand delivered entry cards to all the guests who were in New York, she told the court. Those not in the city had theirs delivered by Federal Express. \"We delivered the entry cards at the last moment in order to make it more difficult for the passes to be copied or duplicated,\" Ms Martel said. Every one of the cards had been hand marked by Ms Martel with an individual code identifying the guest and stamped with invisible ink, she added. Guests were also politely informed that no cameras were to be brought into the wedding. \"We compiled information on every person who was going to be involved in the provision of services or goods, including information on when they would be at the Plaza Hotel and where they would be. \"Full sweeps of the main reception room and other key rooms for any surreptitious sound and video equipment were carried out on a regular basis up to and including the final hour before the ceremony itself.\" Guests then had to present their entry cards at check points where they were scanned and, if correct, would be swapped for a gold wedding pin, hand-crafted according to a design commissioned by the bride and groom. If anyone was found with a camera during the event, it was to be taken away by security and the film developed. Any photographs of the wedding would be removed. Every member of the choir was frisked before entering the wedding and one was spotted with a camera. \"Despite the enormous level of security, and despite our very best efforts, we now know that our security arrangements were violated and that illicit photographs were taken during the wedding,\" Ms Martel said. Mr Douglas and Ms Zeta Jones struck a \u00a31m deal to supply OK! with wedding photographs carefully selected from a set taken by photographers of their choice. However, British paparazzo Rupert Thorpe, the son of former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe, allegedly gatecrashed the event and took unauthorised pictures that were published in Hello!, the court heard last week. The couple are seeking \u00a3500,000 in damages from Hello! over the snatched pictures in a joint action with OK!, which is pursuing its rival for \u00a31.75m in compensation. \"The purpose of the security arrangements (which were arranged by us, without the help of OK!) was to prevent access by the media so that we could fully enjoy our wedding day,\" Ms Zeta Jones said in her witness statement to the court. \"Our close friends and family know how paranoid we have been forced to become over the issue of intrusive and unwelcome photography in recent years,\" she added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
