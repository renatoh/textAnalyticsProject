Would I be better off purchasing a high-spec Intel-based Windows PC rather than an iMac, or can I be confident that I can run the Adobe Creative Suite 2 on the new iMac? Richard Minns Jack Schofield replies: This is not a good time to buy an Intel-based Mac specifically to run Adobe Creative Suite 2. This has not been converted to universal binary format for Intel-based Macs, and never will be. As a result, it has to run via the Rosetta translator, and the Windows version of ACS2 runs up to three times faster. Adobe is writing new versions of its programs and will launch Adobe Creative Suite 3 for Intel-based Macs, perhaps next year. In the meantime, Abode advises \"Mac-based customers looking for optimal performance\" to continue with their PowerPC-based Macs (http://tinyurl.com/r3ws8). As a Windows user, it would make more sense for you to run ACS2 on a PC - the programs have the same interfaces - until Adobe releases ACS3. Also, by that time, Apple will have released a new version of the Mac OS X operating system, plus Intel-based versions of its professional desktop PCs, perhaps using superior chips that Intel is releasing later this year. By waiting you will get a better computer, a better operating system and (probably) better applications, all of which should retain their usefulness - and value - longer. The next version of Mac OS X is expected to include Apple's Boot Camp software, which enables an Intel-based Mac to run Windows XP and applications at PC speeds. This could provide a staging strategy, where you run ACS2 under Windows while having a Mac for other purposes. However, Boot Camp is still an early beta and not recommended for serious use. Some users have found that after running XP, they were unable to reboot to Mac OS X. Finally, I recommend buying a top-end Mac for ACS, rather than an iMac. The tower systems are more expandable and flexible, and the iMac screen is not easily adjustable. For best performance, Adobe recommends using two hard drives, with ACS on a different drive from the operating system. I'd also recommend using two screens. ACS2 costs almost \u00a3800, and in a commercial setting, it is a false economy to run it on constrained hardware. Virus dailies I use Trend Micro anti-virus software, and receive automatic updates every day, often two or three times a day. Are their boffins really constantly outwitting the work of a relentless tide of crooks? Pete Allerhand JS: There are new viruses every day, and new variants of old viruses, so yes, there is a constant battle. But there are at least two significant problems. First, thanks to broadband connections and spam emailers, a worm or virus can reach more than 100m PCs in five or six hours, whereas it can take an anti-virus company eight hours to create and test a defence. By that time it may be too late, so it often makes sense to have more than one update per day. Second, in such a fast-paced market, every anti-virus company is at risk of missing a few threats, and even the best could miss half a dozen a month. It makes sense, I think, for anti-virus companies to work together on detecting and identifying malware, while competing in other areas. Ready for Defender I read good things about Microsoft Antispyware/Windows Defender, but it is still in beta. Should non-techies use it? Kathy Arnold JS: Microsoft obtained this program as a going concern by buying Giant Antispyware in December 2004, and it has been rewritten to form part of Windows Vista. Its main claim to fame is that it monitors parts of Windows for changes that could indicate the presence of spyware. However, it doesn't catch everything, so it is still worth running Spybot Search &amp; Destroy and/or Adaware from time to time. Warning: the beta Windows Defender has the option to automatically remove anything it doesn't like without asking for your consent. Ticking the box that says \"Apply actions on detected items during scanning\" is potentially dangerous. Backchat \u00b7 Last week I pointed out that Hotmail users risk having their mail deleted. Michael Juffs says: \"There is a free web-based email service that has no time limit for storing messages: the much overlooked Opera and its Operamail.\" The drawback is that it provides only 3MB of storage space, and the paid-for version only 25MB. \u00b7 Terry Vincent writes from France to say: \"After running CCleaner I found that all of the French in my documents was changed to English (US).\" This is something I can't account for, but is worth raising in the CCleaner help forum at http://forum.ccleaner.com. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
