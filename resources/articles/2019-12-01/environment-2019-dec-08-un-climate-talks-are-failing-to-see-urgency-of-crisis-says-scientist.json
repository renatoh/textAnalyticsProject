Talks are focusing on some of the rules for implementing the 2015 Paris agreement, but the overriding issue of how fast the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions has received little official attention. \u201cWe are at risk of getting so bogged down in incremental technicalities at these negotiations that we forget to see the forest for the trees,\u201d said Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, joint director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. \u201cThere is a risk of disappointment in the UN process because of the inability to recognise that there is an emergency.\u201d In the next few days, environment and finance ministers from more than 190 governments will begin the \u201chigh-level segment\u201d of the UN talks, which began on 2 December, and will finish on Friday. Over the weekend, negotiators produced the latest draft of a key text on carbon markets, which still does not have the consensus needed to pass. The stately pace of negotiations was in stark contrast with the scenes outside the conference in Madrid, where on Friday evening more than 500,000 people marched through the Spanish capital led by the Swedish school striker Greta Thunberg. Protests continued through the weekend, with Extinction Rebellion and groups from across the world. On Monday, Thunberg and other youth activists will hold meetings with officials inside the conference. Rockstr\u00f6m said the UN conference must grapple urgently with reversing emissions of greenhouse gases, which are still on the rise despite repeated scientific warnings over three decades and multiple resolutions by governments to tackle the problem. \u201cWe must bend the curve next year,\u201d he told the Guardian, citing stark warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \u201cNext year is the year of truth. The year when we must move decisively to an economy that really starts to reduce investments in fossil fuels.\u201d Even the coal-fired power plants currently planned or in construction are enough to produce double the amount of carbon that can safely be put in the atmosphere for the next century, Rockstr\u00f6m said. The situation was so dire that governments should be starting to consider geoengineering technology, he said. Such projects could use a combination of natural and artificial means, from seeding clouds to erecting reflectors in space. \u201cGeoengineering has to be assessed, maybe even piloted already in case we need to deploy it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me very nervous. That is really playing with biological processes that might kick back in very unexpected ways. But I don\u2019t think we should rule anything out \u2013 an emergency is an emergency.\u201d As the UN conference enters its final stages, the role of the UK is likely to come under much greater scrutiny. Britain will play host to next year\u2019s conference at which world leaders must pledge much greater cuts in emissions than have yet been made, if the 2015 Paris accord is to succeed. Claire O\u2019Neill, the former Tory climate minister designated to lead next year\u2019s conference, is in Madrid but cannot make official announcements because of the \u201cpurdah\u201d rules surrounding political announcements in the run-up to the general election. However, the UK\u2019s plans were rated as \u201cinsufficient\u201d in a key independent analysis called the Climate Action Tracker. Despite the government\u2019s eye-catching commitment last summer to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 \u2013 one of the first major economies to make such a pledge \u2013 few measures are in place to keep pace with the target. \u201cThere has been a dearth of new significant climate policies in recent years which, if left unaddressed, will leave the UK missing its medium and long-term targets,\u201d concluded the analysis of global emissions-cutting plans. That would damage the host nation\u2019s credibility at next year\u2019s crucial talks in Glasgow, campaigners said. Dr Bill Hare, a climate scientist and the chief executive of Climate Analytics, which carried out the study, said it was clear which of the two biggest parties had the better plans on the issue before this week\u2019s general election. \u201cWhile both major political parties have proposed further climate action, the Conservatives have not put sufficient proposals on the table to close this gap, whereas [our analysis shows] the Labour\u2019s \u00a3250bn could easily close that gap and push on towards a 1.5C pathway,\u201d Hare said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
