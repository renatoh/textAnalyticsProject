In last month's catch up, David Jackson had set off on a tour around Europe; Kate Jenner had started temping at an advertising agency; Jo Danvers was applying for jobs in TV and Nikhita Mahajan had signed up for a Spanish course. This month, one of our fantasy finalists has secured a permanent, graduate job and another discovers she's got the \"right trousers\". Kate Jenner She's done it! University of Nottingham hispanic studies graduate Kate Jenner has been offered - and accepted - a job as new business and PR assistant at advertising agency Abbott Mead Vickers (AMV). \"I took the job because, in my opinion AMV is the UK's top advertising agency,\" she says. \"The week I started, the BBDO network, of which AMV is a part, won an award for being the most creative network in the world. I feel it's a fantastic career opportunity, which I will really enjoy and which will really challenge me. Having started as a temp I'm already familiar with the environment and some of the people. \"My job involves fielding calls from journalists (both trade and national press), sending images for articles, collecting press cuttings, assisting the new business department in preparation of presentations, ensuring all agency promotional materials are kept up-to date, updating new business databases, co-ordinating all new business/PR mail outs and researching new business opportunities. It's very busy - everything has to be done yesterday!\" Kate won't reveal her precise starting salary but admits it's in the range of \u00a316,000-\u00a320,000. \"I feel happy because I have earned my job on my own merits,\" she says. Nikhita Mahajan Wannabe management consultant Nikhita has just had her first formal interview, at financial giant Bloomberg. It's an experience she'd prefer to forget. \"It was a complete nightmare,\" she admits. \"I had no idea what to expect and I acted like a complete idiot. Needless to say, I didn't get the job. I was annoyed with myself for getting so nervous and flustered and I was fazed by the fact that the people I was up against had more experience and better qualifications than me.\" Undeterred, she has continued to send out application forms and is still enjoying her temporary job in the marketing department at the University of London Careers Service. Although she's starting to plan a trip round the world, she's feeling a little dejected about her future career. \"I'm becoming less aggressive and less competitive, which I don't think is good if I want to get onto a graduate programme next year. But some of my friends are getting themselves sorted, which is great. I find that when my friends and people around me are doing well, it inspires and motivates me too.\" Jo Danvers Proving that determination and persistence can pay off, Jo has been offered a short, paid contract as a runner at Aardman Animation. \"I'll be working on an advertisement they're making,\" she says. \"I'm really pleased as I've been badgering them for months. Unfortunately, it's not permanent. \"I've also had an interview for a job as marketing assistant at Bristol Old Vic theatre, a job that I really want. It's perfect because it involves lots of on the job training. \"I was getting desperate so I've been applying for lots of varied jobs, from reception work, to editorial assistant, to adviser at an alternative health clinic. I've had quite a few rejections, even from the ones I thought I could do, which was quite disheartening. I've also applied for a couple of graduate recruitment schemes at publishing companies. But now that things are finally starting to happen on the job front I'm feeling much more positive.\" David Jackson David has returned from his trip around Europe. \"The highlight was visiting Lake Como in northern Italy,\" he recalls. \"I rented a bike and cycled about 15 km in beautiful weather, up hills. I ached for four days after. The whole point of the trip was to get away from things and to figure out what I want from life. To a certain extent I've done this, but above all I enjoyed the freedom of being able to do whatever and go wherever I pleased. \"I'd now love a job with international prospects. But I think I'll have to improve my language skills if I want to use them in business. Confused arguments with surly French train conductors have shown me that evening classes might be a good idea.\" On the applications front, David has had two rejection emails, one from Mars and the other form Vodafone. \"Although depression isn't setting in quite yet, I am worried about the other applications I've made. Both companies said my application didn't quite meet their criteria.\" Last month we asked you to email us if you could relate to the experiences of our Fantasy Finalists. Here are a few of your responses: \u00b7 Jo Fernihough has a degree in English literature and French from Edinburgh University and is currently working and studying in New York. She says: \"I want to get into marketing and have got relevant experience. Although I did not expect a job to be handed to me on exiting university, like the Fantasy Finalists I thought that if I had a decent degree, relevant work experience and international experience, finding a job would be a lot easier than it is proving to be.\" \u00b7 Andrew Walsh , who studied environmental health at Manchester Metropolitan University, says he actually feels a little jealous of our Fantasy Finalists. \"My graduation route and post university career are somewhat different. I didn't have to impress companies at graduate fairs, fill in application form after application form or attend three-day interview panels at posh hotels. \"Instead, I have settled, quickly, into the relative comforts of local government. My career route was decided as a teen and within six weeks of graduating I had a job as an environmental health practitioner, with a salary of \u00a322,000.\" \u00b7 Rachel Featherstone did a degree in business and tourism management at Oxford Brookes University. She says: \"I agree with absolutely everything the four fantasy finalists have said. I'm missing my freedom so much. \"I'm temping and have found it very hard adjusting to working eight hours every day, rather than going to seven hours of lectures a week. It's also hard to find time to update my CV and apply for jobs.\" \u00b7 \"Life after graduation was indeed a shock to the system,\" says Ann Coyne, who has a degree in theatre administration from QMUC, Edinburgh. \"The big question is: has all this debt, all this poverty stood me in better stead than all those who left school and, like Kate Jenner said, went straight to work? Only time will tell.\" Next month: We find out more about Kate Jenner's new job hilaryfreeman@blueyonder.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
