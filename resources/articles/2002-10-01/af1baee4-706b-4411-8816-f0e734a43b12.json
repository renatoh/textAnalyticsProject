But should that not be achieved, he made it clear that he will not resign. Vogts has been under pressure following his six matches in charge. In the only competitive game - against the Faroe Islands - they managed only a draw. The defeats have been in friendlies against France, Nigeria, South Korea, South Africa and Denmark. It is a record that has instigated calls for his removal, yet it became clear yesterday he has no intention of throwing in the towel. The German emerged from a training session at the Strathclyde Homes Stadium and said: \"I will still be in charge even if we lose on Saturday. We will go there looking for a win, although a draw would be enough. I will be seeing it through regardless. \"I understand the questions about my future; it is normal and criticism is part of the job. However, I have a lot to do. I have to build a new team because since France 98 the country has had four lost years. I have so much to do and not just with the national side but also with the under- 21's and youths.\" Whether the Scottish Football Associaition will see it that way is another matter. But having appointed Vogts on a salary of \u00a3350,000 for four years along with Rainer Bonhof as the under-21 manager, it would not be in the best financial position to dismiss him even if it wanted to. Vogts is convinced that he is the victim of a media campaign more than anything else. \"I was shocked by the newspaper reaction after the Faroes but not by the people in the street who have been very nice,\" he said. He has defended his corner and his thoughts are now on the forthcoming match. But he saw six players - Robbie Stockdale, Neil McCann, Steven Pressley, Barry Ferguson, Paul Lambert and Scott Severin - miss the opening training session for a variety of injury reasons, the Rangers captain Ferguson being the most serious. Iceland will be without their key defender Hermann Hreidarsson. The Ipswich player is suffering from a back injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
