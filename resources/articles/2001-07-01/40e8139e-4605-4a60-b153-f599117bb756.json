Standing at seven under, he leads by one stroke from Swede Pierre Fulke, who carded a faultless 67; four birdies, no bogies. \"I played OK,\" Montgomerie shrugged after his second trek round Lytham. But, in truth, the big Scot never got into his stride after a shaky start. Birdies at 11 and 13 - the first of which was particularly fortunate, a wayward second shot bouncing between, over and round a collection of bunkers to safety - looked to have put some slightly unwarranted daylight between himself and the rest of the pack. However, Lytham would not let him get away with this larceny; at the long par-4 15th, his drive took an unlucky kick and found a bunker. He could only splash out and, despite playing a superlative long iron into the heart of the green, could only two-putt for a bogey five. Monty and Fulke are pursued by a triumvirate at five under: Jasper Parnevik, Greg Owen and Joe Ogilvie. Parnevik and his attention seeking - sorry - attention-grabbing trousers were the first things to trouble the leader board this morning; the Swede and his fancy breeches shot a three-under par 68. He was later joined by Owen, a 29-year-old from Mansfield playing in only his third Open, and the even-less-experienced American Ogilvie, who is enjoying his first Open and only his second major. But all three will rue their performance over the tough closing holes. Only Owen came through the closing run of difficult par fours in net level par, yet he may feel the worst of the lot, missing a tiddler on the last green to drop back into the pack. For a while, it looked like Tiger Woods had snapped out of his reverie and would pose the major challenge to Monty's, erm, major challenge. Birdies at 6, 7 and 11 - the latter pocketed after getting up and down from a bunker - was augmented by yet another at 14. Suddenly, the defending champion had shot from level par to four under, and right back into contention. But a poor second shot at the 15th did for Tiger; he slipped back to three under and had to settle for a 68 to go with his opening day 71. Round of the day so far has been posted by Ireland's Des Smyth. He followed up his poor opening-round 74 by shooting six birdies and an eagle to match Colin Montgomerie's tournament best 65. Smyth is a well-positioned four off the lead at three under. Meanwhile, American Frank Linkliter has provided the day's best moment so far. He followed an abject double-bogey six on the 3rd with a not-much-better bogey on the 4th ... and a hole-in-one at the 5th. Linkliter, making his Open debut, sent an easy 6-iron into the heart of the green; it took a couple of high bounces, clattered into the pin and smacked into the cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
