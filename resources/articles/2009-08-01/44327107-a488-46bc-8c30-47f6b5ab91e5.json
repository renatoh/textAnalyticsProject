The NatWest fraud team phoned to ask if I had made the transactions. I said I had not and they cancelled my card. I received a new card but kept the pin. Ten days later I tried to transfer money at the branch and was informed the new card had been reported stolen and that the bank had ordered another one. The replacement card never arrived. Someone had intercepted it and transferred the majority of the money in my business account into my current account. From this account they placed a bet for \u00a36,000 and withdrew \u00a3250 cash using my card. I accept this person knew a large amount of personal information and must have had my pin, which was common to my telephone and online banking pin, which NatWest knew had been compromised. The fraudster changed my contact telephone number so, when the \u00a36,000 transaction was questioned, they could personally confirm it. NatWest says it can't find a point of compromise for my pin and that without this, I won't be refunded. I have never given my pin to anyone and am always vigilant online. I was about to go on a six-month working holiday to Australia but, without this money, it will be impossible. RG, Manchester Account takeover is the fastest-rising type of fraud. After more than trebling last year, it rose 75% in the first quarter of this year. Typically, fraudsters start with a few small purchases and, if successful, raid the rest of the account. So I am amazed NatWest did not see this coming, keep a special watch on your account and at least provide you with a new pin after your account had been targeted. It says it didn't because your pin had not been used for the mobile top-ups. But the bank didn't provide a new pin either when it sent out a second replacement card. NatWest should have been suspicious when this second card was reported lost so quickly and your telephone number changed. Indeed, alarm bells should have been clanging all around head office. The fraudster then became bolder. Customers whose bank cards have been compromised, and so cannot withdraw cash until the new one arrives, are allowed emergency cash after they answer some security questions. This enabled the person to take a further \u00a360 from your account, which the bank has already refunded. To top it all, on 11 June, the fraudster had the audacity to walk into a betting office in Manchester and place a \u00a36,000 bet, with your money, on a sporting event taking place on 15 June. You reported the fraud on 12 June but no one blocked the bet or stopped them picking up the \u00a39,000 winnings in cash. The Betfred betting shop involved said there was no CCTV footage. Perhaps the crook knew where the cameras pointed. NatWest was reluctant to return your money because it could not establish how your pin and personal details were compromised. Now it has capitulated and refunded you \u00a36,330. Before setting off for Australia you should open a new bank account with different security details. \u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU and include a telephone number.
