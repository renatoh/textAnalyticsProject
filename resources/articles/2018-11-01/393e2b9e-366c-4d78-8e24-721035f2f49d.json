This was not just a first win of the season; not when they had gone 205 days without scoring a home goal, a 659-minute barren streak that threatened to make them the wrong sort of history-makers. Instead that mantle settles on Fulham. As Huddersfield avoided the ignominy of joining the Mansfield team of 1971-72 as the only English sides to fail to score in the first six home games of a league season, Fulham equalled Southampton\u2019s divisional record by conceding 29 times in their first 11 games of a Premier League season. Yet while the statistical distinction is unwanted, Slavisa Jokanovic has more immediate concerns after Fulham\u2019s worst start to a top-flight season deteriorated further. A sequence of six straight defeats imperils his position. With a trip to Liverpool next he may approach the international break with some trepidation. \u201cI personally trust in myself,\u201d said Jokanovic. But he accepted his fate depends on those who let him down on Monday night. \u201cIt is outside of my control,\u201d added the Serb. \u201cIt is not only in my hands. Part of the job is in the hands of my players.\u201d They conducted a post-match inquest in the dressing room. \u201cMy players have some words after the game but it is a little bit late then.\u201d \u201cReally sorry everyone\u201d was the message on the club\u2019s Twitter feed at the end. Such apologies were probably not envisaged when Fulham spent \u00a3100m in the summer. This has the potential to be the most expensive relegation of them all and, given the resources, one of the more avoidable. Fulham have the talent but showed little of the character the victorious manager, David Wagner, identified in his Huddersfield side. \u201cThey seem to be a little bit scared,\u201d Jokanovic admitted. \u201cMaybe we didn\u2019t understand how important this game is. We were a little bit confused. We didn\u2019t play the first 45 minutes with enough intensity.\u201d Perhaps his most remarkable admission about a side with footballing principles was: \u201cWe started to kick the ball without any sense.\u201d Given Fulham\u2019s self-destructive tendencies it was sadly symbolic that they donated the only goal, Timothy Fosu-Mensah being debited with Huddersfield\u2019s winner. Thereafter it was indicative of their fortunes that Kevin McDonald, who came on in a half-time double switch, lasted only 20 minutes. Change is a constant. Jokanovic has named a different defence every game this season and is no nearer to finding a formula for clean sheets. Fosu-Mensah inadvertently applied the finishing touch when two Germans combined, Christopher Schindler meeting Chris L\u00f6we\u2019s cross, to make it a happy anniversary for a third. \u201cSometimes everything comes together,\u201d said Wagner, who was tasked with avoiding relegation to League One when appointed in November 2015. \u201cThree years I am here, this was my 50th win and for sure one of the most important because, after such a long period, you need this feeling.\u201d The sensation of scoring at home was novel enough. Philip Billing had struck the bar with a thunderbolt and Alex Pritchard drew a fine save from Sergio Rico to add to their litany of near-misses. \u201cIf you hit the bar and post as often as we have, you think: \u2018Come on, what is going on here?\u2019 Huddersfield\u2019s previous home goal came so long ago that the scorer, Thomas Ince, has since made 15 appearances for Stoke. While he has returned to the Championship Huddersfield approached their task in a manner to suggest they will not go down without a fight. \u201cIf you don\u2019t bring passion and aggression you have no chance,\u201d said Schindler. Huddersfield displayed both in considerable quantities. He, Billing and Aaron Mooy were outstanding. Their team mates were willing allies. \u201cThe guys delivered,\u201d said Wagner. \u201cWe showed spirit and fighting intensity and in the second half, we were able to bring the result over the line. We know it is possible to deliver in big-pressure games.\u201d Huddersfield have already won a relegation battle and limited Fulham to one shot on target. The beaten manager sought solace from the past after consulting last year\u2019s league table. \u201cAfter 11 games Crystal Palace had four points and didn\u2019t get relegated,\u201d Jokanovic observed. But, and while he did not mention it, only after changing their manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
