It has been particularly surprising to see the Munster boys miss a few. I have always fancied writing a whole book on one solitary vivid happening - one Olympic race, say, or a single one-off match - and now Munsterman and London journalist Alan English has done just that, 268 pages on ancient Limerick's most unforgettably florid 80 minutes ever: October 31 1978, Munster v New Zealand. Irresistible. In a way, as beginning, middle and end, the whole dramatic unity swirls around pages 182 to 186 - five pages on a single tackle, the clap of thunder which turned the day. On the one hand, cold-eyed strutting stranger in black, best wing in the world Stu Wilson; on the other, diminutive teacher and unlikely hometown sheriff, Seamus Dennison. I precis: Wilson: We pull one of our favourite moves, which involves me coming in from the wing. I could see everything unfolding. Perfect ... when this little fella absolutely blew me back. He just propelled straight into my ribcage. I was thinking, \"Why's he here? He shouldn't be here ...\" Dennison: If your timing's right, it doesn't matter how small you are. I poleaxed him. It was just dandy ... A right good thump. I buried him and that was it. Corris Thomas, referee: The most incredible tackle I saw in 17 years as a ref. Wilson at 100mph on a switch ball and it was literally as if he'd run into a brick wall and just slid down it. He collapsed in a heap. He didn't go backwards. He just crumpled ... and every Munster player had grown 12 inches. Munster 12 All Blacks 0. Immortality. Typhoon was not everyone's cup of tea Every week another clutch of birthdays reminds you of, well, mortality. Half a century ago a whole short-trousered generation was enthused at emulating a suddenly-blowing tearaway typhoon called Tyson. Frank was 75 this week. That's nothing: Tony Mottram was 85 - was there Mottramania at Wimbledon in 1948 when Tony (Buster's pere) made the Wimbledon quarters? Willie John McBride received his bus pass this week, can you credit it, and those two once so schoolboy-faced, decorously courtly maestros of summer and winter respectively, Derek Underwood and Pat Jennings, are celebrating their 60ths. But the Typhoon 75? Impossible. When Gloucestershire played Northants in 1954, Frank's dander up, we sent in as nightwatchman our own veteran fast bowler George Lambert, presuming the pace bowlers' union rules would end the scary stream of bouncers. They didn't. George somehow survived and returned, quivering, to be met at the wicket-gate by spinner Sam Cook with a pint and a double-whisky chaser: \"Get these down you, George - the young bugger'll be twice as quick in the morning!\" Turpin tincture leaves radio men choking Those with longer memories than a score of years compared Ricky Hatton's intrepidly unflinching championship donnybrook in Manchester on Sunday morning not so much with Barry McGuigan's heady defeat of Eusebio Pedroza 20 Junes ago, but with Randolph Turpin's fabled dismantling of Sugar Ray Robinson in the summer of 1951. Except that Turpin didn't win - or rather, not according to the two BBC radio men at the ringside that epic night at London's Earls Court arena. First broadcasting celebrity to charm my childhood was lovely, logorrhoeic Raymond Glendenning, portly, purply-voiced commentator with handlebar moustache. They once timed him at 176 words in 30 seconds. Unlike the Guardian's own garrulous radio ringside ace John Rawling on Sunday, Glendenning completely misread Turpin's imperishable 15-rounder 54 years ago. Presuming too much on Robinson's reputation, he insisted a coasting champ had matters entirely in hand, and his inter-round sidekick, a former referee and fruity patrician called (you have to believe it) W Barrington-Dalby, cosily concurred. Both had Sugar Ray a mile ahead at the start of the 15th, although Barrington-Dalby did offer: \"Only a whirlwind grandstand finish could possibly snatch it for Turpin.\" As it was, Turpin easily won the verdict, the referee giving only four rounds to a pallid, ambushed Robinson. When radio listeners read their newspapers next morning, shoals of complaints rained in on the BBC. Fleet Street derided the pair. Dalby stammered that in his defining sentence he had meant \"clinch\" not \"snatch\" but good ol' Raymond (for once) kept mum, not even bothering to deny Sunday People charges that his favoured inter-round tincture - \"for stamina and lubricating the throat muscles\" - was a mix in equal measure of \"honey, water and malt whisky\". Both were soon dropped from ringside duties and young Dublin broth Eamonn Andrews took over. Reuters turn out the lights on Fleet Street Era's end. More like end of The End. Now only DC Thomson, publisher of the Beano, remains a Fleet Street publisher. On Wednesday a service at St Bride's marks finis to Reuters' long reign in Fleet Street. Once they were kings. I went for two interviews there. My shorthand too dud. Reuters trained the Guardian's present tennis and rugby correspondents, as well as Matthew Engel, star former cricket corr. Spot-on accuracy was Reuters' bag. Though not on June 28 1914, as a London horseracing subeditor keenly awaited the result from France of that afternoon's Longchamp's Grand Prix de Paris. Over the wires finally winged the message - so he issued the race placings to all worldwide sources: \"1, Sarajevo; 2, Ferdinand; 3, Assassinated.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
