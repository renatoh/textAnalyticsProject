Italy has Eurochocolate in Perugia, while France has the Salon du Chocolat in Paris. Both are in October, but if you can't wait that long, the good news is that Switzerland's offering, the Geneva Chocolate festival, takes place this Saturday. At least 15 Swiss chocolate producers will be displaying their wares alongside a chocolate fountain and 'chococinema'. It takes place in the small town of Versoix, just outside Geneva, home to venerable chocolate maker Favarger, which will open its doors for Wonka-style factory tours on the day. But don't panic if you miss it - Belgium's Chocolate Festival kicks off in Bruges on 6 April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
