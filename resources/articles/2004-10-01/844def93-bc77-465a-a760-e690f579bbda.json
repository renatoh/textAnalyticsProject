The 50-page report by Jean-Christophe Rufin, a humanitarian aid specialist turned bestselling novelist, said \"a specific armoury\" was urgently needed to fight the growing risk of racist and anti-semitic sentiments giving birth to \"organised political forces\". The interior minister, Dominique de Villepin, said the police had recorded 123 racist attacks and 294 threats in France in the first nine months of 2004, as well as 166 anti-semitic attacks and 584 threats. The totals were higher than for the whole of last year and were \"utterly unacceptable in a country like ours\", he said. Mr Rufin, who based his conclusions on police data and a large number of interviews, said that contrary to popular belief the majority of anti-semitic acts in France were not carried out by supporters of the far right and disaffected youths of north African origin. \"Anti-semitic acts are the work of a far more diverse group of French people who use Jews as their scapegoats,\" said Mr Rufin, who is a former vice-president of M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res and Goncourt prize-winning novelist. \"Attacks and threats against French Jews are a social phenomenon at once new, evident and extremely preoccupying.\" France, which likes to portray itself as the cradle of human rights, is highly embarrassed by the recent sharp rise in anti-semitic and racist acts. Aside from regular instances of desecration of cemeteries and swastika graffiti on Jewish property, offences have in cluded firebombings of synagogues and verbal abuse in schools. The country is home to western Europe's biggest Jewish and Muslim communities - around 600,000 Jews, and an estimated 5 million Muslims. Last month President Jacques Chirac made a stirring national appeal for racial and religious tolerance as part of a campaign against attacks, which he said were \"spreading insidiously\". Mr de Villepin welcomed Mr Rufin's report, saying it was a \"personal but extremely useful contribution\" to a crucial debate, and that its conclusions \"deserve to be studied very carefully indeed\". Mr Rufin said the evidence showed that most people found guilty of anti-semitic acts in France shared common characteristics, such as a \"lack of bearings, a rootlessness, a loss of identity, a sense of social frustration and failure, a disintegrated family\". Pronounced anti-Zionism amounted to a form of anti-semitism and should be equally reprimanded, he said. \"Anti-Zionism legitimises the Palestinian armed struggle even when it targets innocent civilians,\" he said. \"Thus it could also legitimise violent acts committed in France. By the same token, accusations of racism, apartheid and nazism against Israel could by extension put France's own Jewish population in danger.\" Among possible ways forward, Mr Rufin urged legislation specifically targeting anti-semitic and racist acts. French law generally views racial motivation as an aggravating factor in an attack, not as an offence in itself. The public expression of anti-semitic or racist views or insults is covered only by the highly complex and unwieldy 1881 Press Act. \"This was an act designed to promote and defend the freedom of expression,\" Mr Rufin said. \"It is completely unsuited to the job it is now called on to do.\" He called for enforceable regulations to combat racism and anti-semitism in schools, including at primary level; \"clearer, more complete and more transparent figures\" to allow for international comparisons; and evidence of how many cases were successfully prosecuted. Mr Rufin also recommended the foundation of a National Observatory on Racism and Anti-Semitism, and said special vigilance was needed in media broadcasts. He said it was \"extremely difficult\" to be precise about racism - as distinct from anti-semitism - in France because of the \"wide variety of its forms of expression\" and the fact that \"the very foundations of the French republican model forbid citizens from being distinguished according to ethnic or religious criteria\". He added, however, that most racist violence, as opposed to discrimination, was the work of small minority groups acting in accordance with a warped ideology. On Corsica, which accounts for half of all racially-motivated violence in France, locals explain their treatment of north African immigrants as \"a fight against crime and drug trafficking\", Mr Rufin said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
