Yet once again the Royal's Nutcracker delivers its familiar package of old-fashioned pleasures, and once again it doesn't fail. Since this is live dance, with a magic that depends on sleight of hand, quick wits, and fast footwork, there is always the chance of error. The performance I saw snagged occasionally on ragged steps and a mistimed trick or two, while the sound of sticking stage machinery undercut a transformation scene. Yet Peter Wright's 25-year-old production exerts a near-infallible charm, simply because at the heart of its gorgeous confectionary of dance, music and design is a basic, but enduring, fantasy of Christmas miracles and young love. Crucial to the fantasy are the ballet's two central couples \u2013 Clara and her Nutcracker, and the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Prince. Dancing the former, with a classically English style, are Leanne Cope and Paul Kay, both deliciously earnest, hopeful and fun. The poetic logic of Wright's choreography depends on buoyant footwork and a curving, almost delirious freedom in the upper body, and Cope and Kay possess these qualities in spades. As the Sugar Plum couple, Sarah Lamb and Sergei Polunin look ravishing together, their bodies making an elegantly proportioned fit, their lifts and balances perfectly finessed. Lamb still lacks grandeur and delicacy at the extremes of her range, but Polunin, with his deep, plush plies and floating jump clinches the majesty of their double act. It's worth begging, buying or borrowing tickets now, since next year the Royal's Nutcracker is apparently taking a rest from the schedules. In rep until 1 January.
