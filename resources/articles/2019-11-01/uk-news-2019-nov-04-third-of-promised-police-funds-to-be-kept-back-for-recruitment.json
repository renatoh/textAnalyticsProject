The Home Office will retain some \u00a316.3m for \u201crecruitment programme costs\u201d, out of \u00a345m announced to fund the first 2,000 officers by April 2020. The decision was contained in official letters sent to forces last week, informing them how much money they would receive. The Home Office said the \u00a316.3m would be used for advertising and key investments to support the biggest police recruitment drive in decades. Some in policing believe the amount of money being kept back is very high. Labour accuses the Conservatives of diverting public money away from fighting crime to spend on advertising in order to promote their own policies. One of the letters seen by the Guardian says: \u201cAs you are aware, the chancellor recently announced a new funding pot of \u00a345.1m for 2019-20 to support the early recruitment of additional officers, with the ambition of delivering an additional 2,000 officers by March 2020.\u201d The letters say \u201c\u00a328.8m of this funding has been awarded for force level recruitment\u201d, and state the amount each force will get, and say \u201cthe remaining \u00a316.3m will contribute towards recruitment programme costs\u201d. The shadow policing minister, Louise Haigh, said: \u201cThe public will be surprised that cash promised for cops is being squirrelled away by ministers to spend on promoting the policy, rather than delivering actual officers. \u201cJust like every other promise the Tories have made on policing, this pledge has unravelled under the slightest scrutiny. After nine years of broken promises and brutal cuts, you simply cannot trust the Tories on law and order.\u201d The government has promised money to recruit 20,000 additional officers by 2023, with Boris Johnson pledging \u00a3750m for the first full year. The recruitment drive essentially replaces those police officers lost when the Conservatives cut the force from 2010 onwards. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe government has committed an immediate \u00a345m to kickstart the recruitment drive and all of this money will be used to support the police uplift programme. We are also investing \u00a3750m of new funding for 2020-21 to enable forces to meet their officer recruitment targets. \u201cThe majority of the \u00a345.1m committed for this year will go direct to police forces, with \u00a316.3m being used to improve training processes, raise awareness of policing vacancies across the country and develop elements of the IT infrastructure to support the uplift in officer numbers \u2013 all essential investments to deliver the uplift programme.\u201d The Home Office letter says the money each of the 43 police forces in England and Wales will receive can be used for them to take out advertising to attract candidates. David Jamieson, police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands and a Labour politician, said: \u201cThe huge slice taken out is just ridiculous, it is just an outrage. The advertising, we are doing that locally anyway.\u201d The Home Office added: \u201cWe are committed to recruiting 20,000 new police officers over the next three years \u2013 the biggest police recruitment drive in decades \u2013 and meeting the funding requirements for this. \u201cUp to 6,000 additional officers will be recruited by the end of 2020-21 and shared between the 43 police forces in England and Wales.\u201d After entering government in 2010 the Conservatives claimed they could cut the cost to the taxpayer of law enforcement while cutting crime. However, that policy has been reversed after a rise in violent crime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
