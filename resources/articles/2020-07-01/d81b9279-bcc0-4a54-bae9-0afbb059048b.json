US Open met PGA Tour in Ohio. A day otherwise notable for a 423-yard Bryson DeChambeau drive looked set to belong to Woods as he raced to two under par inside three holes. Given the 15-times major champion\u2019s lack of tournament play, a subsequent regression was not altogether surprising. \u201cTiger\u2019s just not sharp,\u201d observed the watching Jack Nicklaus. Still, Woods\u2019s one under par 71 was impressive given the context. A birdie at the 18th sent Woods to the scoring tent with a smile. \u201cI would like to have started with easier conditions,\u201d Woods admitted. \u201cWind pumping and swirling all over the place. It felt good. I was a little bit rusty, but felt like overall it was a good start. \u201cI was certainly feeling the edginess and nervousness and anxiousness of playing. Getting out there and feeling something I hadn\u2019t felt in a while, it felt good.\u201d Rory McIlroy, playing in the company of Woods, lies one stroke better off. The Northern Irishman gave a nod of approval towards Woods\u2019s \u201cgreat start.\u201d McIlroy added: \u201cHe was hitting it nicely. He sort of had most things under control today. I\u2019ve always liked playing with him because of that rhythm that he has.\u201d Lest it not be forgotten this was also a positive day for McIlroy. DeChambeau, who has turned heads since the PGA Tour\u2019s resumption due to demonstrations of extreme power, battered the drive in question down the 1st. It was wind assisted but still notable, including to those who believe modern equipment is distorting this sport. \u201cI sometimes can\u2019t believe it,\u201d said DeChambeau. \u201cThere were years where I hit five-iron into that hole and now I\u2019m hitting a 30-yard little shot. It\u2019s wild. I\u2019m just blessed that I\u2019ve been able to figure some stuff out with the driver.\u201d That DeChambeau signed for a 73 means \u2013 thankfully \u2013 golf isn\u2019t yet an exact science. Tony Finau\u2019s 66 means he claimed the lead at the end of day one. Dustin Johnson, the former world No 1, stumbled to an 80 as included four sixes. \u201cBeen there\u201d cried amateurs in unison."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
