Eden Hazard had been receiving treatment for that infamous hip injury on the day Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s second spell as Chelsea manager was curtailed back in December, the Belgian still absent a few days later as Stamford Bridge\u2019s collective grief gave way to fury aimed at an underachieving team and a board whose patience had snapped. The buzzwords in the stands were \u201csnake\u201d and \u201crat\u201d, echoed soundbites of the departed\u2019s heightened paranoia over the last months of his tenure. Hazard was neither of those. Nor was he entirely blameless. The word is not volunteered, but the suggestion is that text had Hazard admitting he felt ashamed of his own efforts. \u201cI sent him the message to say I was sorry he had gone and \u2026 well \u2026 just that I was sorry,\u201d says the Belgian. \u201cWe\u2019d enjoyed all that success together last season, but this time round we hadn\u2019t. I felt a little bit guilty because I\u2019d been player of the year. I\u2019d been one of the most decisive players, and this year I\u2019d performed less well. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been at the same level. So I sent that text to Jos\u00e9 and he came back to me, wishing me all the best for the future. For a team of champions to go through what we have this year even I can\u2019t explain. Things have been better recently, but we\u2019re still not winning games quite as we used to. No one can put his finger on what\u2019s happened at Chelsea.\u201d So much about the champions\u2019 title defence has been baffling. The team\u2019s form had flummoxed Mourinho as, too often, perennial winners were reduced to broken men. Hazard, refreshingly honest when he reflects on a campaign of anticlimax, came to personify their toils. The irrepressible force who had illuminated a title pursuit, breathing life into a flagging side as they staggered towards the finish line, has endured the first prolonged lull of a nine-year senior career. There have been niggling injuries and missed opportunities, fluffed penalties and shots cannoning back from the woodwork to leave even him smiling ruefully at just how brutally his luck had turned. His influence had diminished just as his team needed him most of all. For a player who prides himself on being a key part in a collective, his inability to live up to his billing has been a source of exasperation. Social media timelines were littered with memes reminding followers what life had been like back on 3 May 2015 \u201cwhen Hazard last scored for Chelsea\u201d. The numbers, once a rolling tally of assists, goals and trophies, had become rather more sinister: 30 fruitless games, 273 days and 2,357 minutes stuck on his Chelsea tally of 49. Then, last Sunday, Darren Potter clumsily sent the 25-year-old sprawling in the MK Dons\u2019 penalty area and Chelsea\u2019s No10 stroked in the resultant spot-kick. His previous goal had claimed his club the Premier League title and prompted an outpouring of joyous relief after a plod of a run-in. At Stadium MK, where FA Cup progress had already felt assured, the visitors\u2019 outfield players mobbed him in such a frenzy of delight that the celebrations told their own story. Hazard, his corner hopefully turned, can only offer theories as to why his form had stagnated at club level while he continued to thrive for Belgium. \u201cI\u2019d played some very good games, at Manchester United, at Tottenham Hotspur, but they\u2019d lacked a goal. There\u2019ve been times when I could have scored myself, but I\u2019ve played a pass to a team-mate instead. It never became an obsession for me to score at all costs. I\u2019ve always said that I\u2019m not a big scorer, I\u2019m a worker. But you can\u2019t escape you\u2019ve not scored and it\u2019s already January, so last Sunday was a bit of a relief. \u201cI don\u2019t think my morale was down, but it plays on your mind a bit. Everything went so well in the past. This year, not so much. But you have to tell yourself that football is like that. I\u2019ve had more ups than downs in my career. All you can do is keep working. You still have to take enjoyment out of what you\u2019re doing and things will turn, and my smile has always been there. In good moments and bad. I\u2019m somebody who can laugh even at myself. That happens now and again, when I\u2019ve made a mess of really simple things. I say to the other guys in the dressing-room: \u2018Bloody hell, did you see what I did then?\u2019\u201d Didier Drogba, who had become a mentor last season when the pair were club-mates, was readily available to offer advice and support from his new base in Montreal. \u201cHe\u2019s always backed me,\u201d says Hazard. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether he\u2019d ever experienced periods like that in his career, but I\u2019ve always considered him a bit like a big brother. He\u2019s there for me, whether it\u2019s a text message or a phone call, and he\u2019s helped raise my spirits. But I\u2019ve never doubted myself. \u201cThis is the first time this has happened to me, but it was always going to happen at some stage. You have to learn from it. I\u2019m a human being, not a machine. I\u2019ve been a professional since I was 16, so maybe that has had an influence too.\u201d By the time Hazard turned 25 last month he had already played 446 senior games for clubs and country. Lionel Messi had 431 to his name at that age, and Cristiano Ronaldo 407. When the Belgian limped off with a groin strain at Crystal Palace four days before his birthday, he had mustered 186 appearances in three years. His workload has been onerous. There is also the theory that the accolades thrust upon him for last year\u2019s blistering performances had weighed unexpectedly heavily and made him even more of a marked man, if that was possible for the Premier League\u2019s most fouled player of 2014\u201315. \u201cBut pressure has been there for five years because I\u2019m always the man people look at. Maybe this season a bit more than last year, given last season was exceptional. We knew Chelsea would be the team to beat this year. That made life harder, but it doesn\u2019t explain everything. Personally, it\u2019s nice to have a good season, but to follow it up again is even better still. \u201cThis is my fourth year in English football so, maybe, a spell like this was always on the cards. Maybe I should have seen it coming. It\u2019s been an accumulation of things: a bit of tiredness, a bit of this, a bit of that. I\u2019m not looking for excuses. And it\u2019s been an important period in my development. I\u2019ve learned from it. Like with the injuries. I\u2019ve been used to the kicks, they\u2019re normal. I know how to protect myself. I\u2019ve learned that over the years, but I\u2019d hardly experienced this number of little injuries before, and it\u2019s about learning if you are rushing back too early, or if you\u2019re properly fit and ready to come back.\u201d The first of those knocks, which saw him floored in stoppage time on the campaign\u2019s opening day against Swansea, is not up for discussion given the on-going legal proceedings around Dr Eva Carneiro and her obligation to enter the field of play to treat the stricken player. Yet the drip-feed of niggles since has clearly blunted Hazard\u2019s impact, with events at Leicester City in what proved to be Mourinho\u2019s last match in charge casting a shadow. It was Jamie Vardy who kicked the Chelsea player on his hip, the Belgian eventually retreating from the turf and down the tunnel for treatment while his manager, a man sensing mutiny all around by then, chuntered on the touchline. The Portuguese subsequently suggested the player \u201cmust have a serious injury\u201d which, in the context of all that \u201cpalpable discord\u201d at the time, was perceived as Mourinho casting doubt on commitment. Hazard is well aware of the theories, but treats them with the disdain they merit. \u201cThey were ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cActually, if you look at what happened it wasn\u2019t a particularly hefty kick, but my body was tired. In that situation it only takes a little kick to put you out, and it\u2019s not normal to take one on the hip. I tried to come back on to the pitch, but with my first sprint I knew I couldn\u2019t move properly. If I can\u2019t play at 100%, I give up my place to someone who can. The pain was there for a few days afterwards and I couldn\u2019t play.\u201d Did Mourinho doubt that? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. But you\u2019ll have to ask him.\u201d The impression is that Hazard retains a deep respect for the man who harnessed the work ethic in his game, and under whom he celebrated a second domestic championship to add to the Ligue 1 title claimed with Lille in 2011. The interim manager, Guus Hiddink, \u2013 \u201cHe has given us a bit more freedom and the confidence to raise our game\u201d \u2013 has been denied the Belgian\u2019s regular involvement as yet, but fitness and, judging by the 17-minute cameo at Watford in midweek, confidence have now been restored. Manchester United will be braced for an awkward afternoon in south-west London on Sunday even if Chelsea\u2019s hopes of finishing in the top four may already be dashed. The prospect of missing out on the Champions League next term would normally be abhorrent, particularly for a player whose decision to reject other suitors and move to Stamford Bridge four years ago was sealed when Roberto di Matteo\u2019s sixth-placed side claimed the trophy in Munich and guaranteed further involvement. But, when you languish 16 points off the top four with 14 games to play, reality kicks in. So could he cope with a season-long absence from the competition now? \u201cWhen you\u2019re used to playing every year in the Champions League, then yes. Even if missing out for a year, for for the club, would be difficult. Financially. \u201cPlaying in the Champions League was important to me. So, if Chelsea hadn\u2019t won it, I doubt I would have signed. But, this year, we\u2019ll be where we deserve to be. If we\u2019re not in the Champions League, we\u2019ll not have deserved to be in it. We\u2019ll not have done enough to make the top four. You can eat away at 10 or 11 points very quickly, but it\u2019s easier if you still have 30 matches to play. We only have 14 so I think the Premier League is finished. So we\u2019ll have to win [the European Cup] to qualify. Why not? Look at 2012. That\u2019s why I always say we have to target the Champions League.\u201d Paris Saint-Germain, for the third year in succession, await in the knockout phase a week on Tuesday. Laurent Blanc\u2019s side are 24 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and enjoying weekly domestic dominance that might normally dull their edge. \u201cBut, because they\u2019ve already nearly won the French title, their only remaining objective is the Champions League. They\u2019re one of the best teams in the world, though Chelsea are on a different level to some of the teams they play in France and our ambition remains to win the Champions League. It will be a tight tie, like it was the last two years.\u201d It is one Hazard intends to influence. A quiet, unassuming figure off the pitch \u2013 happiest spending time with his three boys at the family home in sleepy Cobham than seeking out the bright lights of London, watching his beloved New York Knicks from afar or playing the dice game Yahtzee with C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta on away trips \u2013 wants to remind the world that he can be an inspiration on it. \u201cI\u2019ve never been one to deliver speeches in the dressing room, like a John Terry, Frank Lampard or Drogba, but I\u2019ve always tried to lead in my own way on the field: demanding the ball, trying to make a difference. The day I\u2019m 100% again, I\u2019m convinced Chelsea will perform better too. It\u2019s up to me to raise my level again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
