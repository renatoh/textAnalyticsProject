On Monday, the grandson of one president and nephew of another announced his candidacy for a congressional seat in Texas. He joined one of the most crowded 2020 contests, the race to replace Pete Olson, a Republican retiring from Texas\u2019s 22nd district, a suburban seat Democrats nearly flipped in 2018 and are targeting aggressively again. Pierce Bush\u2019s announcement video, released on the deadline to get on the ballot, included an image of him speaking next to a picture of his late grandfather, the 41st president who died last year aged 94. \u201cWe face a very challenging time in our nation,\u201d the younger Bush said, claiming the US is \u201con the brink of losing a generation to an idea that socialism and free stuff are the answers to their future. But we all know that socialism has failed everywhere and everyone.\u201d His candidacy opens a new if for now minor front in a long and mostly losing battle with the Trump wing of the Republican party. In 2016, after a Republican presidential primary in which the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Pierce\u2019s uncle, was mercilessly mocked and politically eviscerated by the Trump machine, George HW Bush voted for Hillary Clinton while George W Bush didn\u2019t vote at all. The only Bush currently in public office is the Texas land commissioner George P Bush, son of Jeb. In 2016, he supported Trump. In Texas earlier this year, Trump introduced George P as \u201cthe only Bush that likes me\u201d. Pierce Bush\u2019s father is Neil Bush, George HW\u2019s fourth child who is now a businessman and investor. In the 2016 Republican primary, after his brother\u2019s fall, he supported the Texas senator Ted Cruz. Pierce Bush, who has spent the past three years as Texas chief executive of the national not-for-profit Big Brothers Big Sisters, made no mention of Trump in his announcement video and launched his campaign website with a short biography and no policy positions. Olson is one of six of House Republicans in Texas who will retire next year, among a raft of such departures as Trump remains unpopular nationally but very popular with the Republican base. Once a seat of GOP power, held by the former Republican House majority leader Tom DeLay, Texas\u2019s 22nd district is shifting amid demographic changes and Democrats peeling off suburban women voters. In 2018, Olson won by fewer than 5%. Other Republicans running for Olson\u2019s seat have expressed unwavering support for Trump."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
