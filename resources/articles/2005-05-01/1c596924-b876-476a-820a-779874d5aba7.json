Fifty years on, the film looks brash but also conservative and maladroit, conceived fundamentally from the parent's-eye view. Dean is Jim Stark, a troubled adolescent with an overbearing mom and a blustering, weak-minded dad (Jim Backus). Jim scuffles with the school tough guy and even falls for his best girl, the 16-year-old Natalie Wood. His only friend is someone even more mixed up than he is, the singularly nicknamed \"Plato\", played by Sal Mineo, a wealthy latchkey kid who has a monumental crush on Jim. Mineo winds up upstaging Dean in the final melodramatic confrontation with the police, and we are asked to believe that Dean and Wood find grown-up redemption in trying to behave like proper, and even faintly stuffy parents to him. The drama and hepcat dialogue feel clunky now, but the movie's plea for dads to talk to their children - what we now call emotional literacy - is valid enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
