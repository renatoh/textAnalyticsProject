Three hours before Sir Nicholas Stern published his timber-shivering report, the Times made its front page banner 'A flight to Europe for every reader'. And 18 hours after Stern, the BBC Today programme burst upon a chastened world courtesy of jumping and jetting Jim Naughtie in Arizona. Perhaps they could all start swapping carbon emission credits. Or perhaps media assumptions will have to change, too. Meanwhile, expect some fascinating shifts as the debate (not to mention the globe) heats up. There's little 'cheerful' here, said Bronwen Maddox in the Times. The relevant political tactics 'come down to frightening people, or shaming them, and urging (or forcing) them to change their behaviour'. To which may be added the relevant media tactics of denial, denunciation and bristling suspicion. Here's Melanie Phillips of the Mail crying 'Phooey!' to the 'grand panjandrums' of 'flaky' science, especially 'apocalyptic computer model forecasts of huge rises in temperature' which 'bear as much relation to reality as astrology'. Here's Polly Toynbee in the Guardian attacking our 'mad-dog, know-nothing press' in general, and Phillips (a former Guardian environment editor, as it happens) in particular. Shouting - trading insults rather than credits - won't save the planet, then. What about fright? Enter George Monbiot, in the Guardian again, stopping all road-building, freezing all airport expansion and closing all out-of-town superstores forthwith. (Stack up some 'pretty brutal emergency planning procedures' against 'mass death' - and choose). Enter Michael Tyce, from Waterstock, Oxon, one of the Telegraph's innumerable letter writers on the subject, declaring that, with the 'appointment of the High Prince of Doom, Al Gore, as government adviser, climate change has finally taken on the trappings of a religion'. So, who's a believer? The Guardian and Independent, obviously. The Mirror - 'Be green, not na\u00efve' - up to the point of not mentioning Stern on a front page crammed with Prince William's lost gun and Julie Goodyear's first moment of lesbian joy. The FT has no doubts left: 'Kyoto took five years to negotiate, but the world and its atmosphere cannot wait that long again.' The Times may be sonorous, but it's equally clear. 'Sensible decisions, not emotional responses, are required, and the planet deserves the benefit of the doubt.' Even the Sun, painting topless model Keeley green and giving her top tips to meet the crisis ('Chest is best' when it comes to home freezers) does its bit. The new softer, gentler, caring Bun heeds Stern's 'bleak warning'. Up to a point. But then grander canyons open. You can, like Phillips, be sceptical about the underlying science. You can, like the Bun, wonder 'why we should fork out 30 per cent more for a flight to Spain when chunks of the Amazon rainforest the size of Wales are cleared each year'. You can, like Michael Hanlon, the Mail's science editor, conclude that, in detail, a 'green supertax will hurt only the poor'. You can join the Telegraph in believing that 'governments can't save the planet'. (Give 'businesses, not bureaucrats, the lead role'.) None of this, on examination, is quite as 'mad-dog' as claimed: just various. Monbiot doesn't think Stern half alarming enough 'on the latest science'. More quiescent commentators put a calmer gloss on the facts and the remedies. A few dissident letter writers recall that the last time 'experts agreed about anything was on the existence of WMD in Iraq'. There is a debate and it is, by most recent standards on hot topics like immigration, relatively well informed. Frightening won't do the trick; nor, probably, will shaming. So we're back, on Maddox's prediction, to 'urging or forcing'. But can you do either when there's no consensus? It's a question for governments, to be sure: but one for the media, too. (The New York Times ran just 13 short paragraphs of Stern on the day.). This isn't about selling copies or topping the TV ratings; it's about saving a planet (or not) and spreading a word that resounds and moves minds. And, for once, readers and listeners need exceptional service - not service as usual."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
