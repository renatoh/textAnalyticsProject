If charged and found guilty, the pair could be banned from attending the final at Twickenham against Saracens next week. Cockerill and O'Connor were animated throughout the match, which Leicester won 11-3, and directed unflattering remarks about the match referee, Wayne Barnes, to his assessor, Brian Campsall, who was sitting well within earshot in the main stand. Campsall was so perturbed that he said he would raise the matter with the Rugby Football Union's head of elite referees, Ed Morrison. \"It is not right for referees or assessors to be put under that sort of pressure,\" he said. Cockerill said after the match that he should not have said what he did and that it should not happen again. The RFU's chief disciplinary officer, Jeff Blackett, was on Monday flying back from Auckland where he had been attending a pre-World Cup disciplinary meeting. He had read reports about Welford Road and ordered an inquiry to be held. He was due back in his office on Tuesday morning and aAny charges could be laid by as early as Tuesday evening. Blackett said he was not prepared to comment until the inquiry had been completed. With Leicester appearing in the play-off final at Twickenham against Saracens on Saturday week, any disciplinary hearing would be held sooner rather than later. A year ago the two sides met in the final and the then Saracens director of rugby, Brendan Venter, was banned from going to the ground, and its immediate vicinity, after being found guilty of using foul and abusive language during a match, ironically against Leicester at Welford Road. Cockerill was warned about his future conduct by the RFU, which had received complaints about his behaviour during the play-off semi-final against Bath at Welford Road last season, while O'Connor was investigated last October after a tirade he launched against the referee Romain Poite during the Premiership match at Saracens was clearly heard over the live commentary on Radio Leicester, which issued an apology to listeners. He was not charged. After Venter was banned last year, Blackett issued a warning to directors of rugby and head coaches about the need to keep their emotions, and language, in check. He was then concerned about where club management teams sat during matches and that subject is likely to form part of his inquiry. The RFU is due to confirmon Monday that Leicester's centre, Manu Tuilagi, will be cited for punching Chris Ashton 33 minutes into the match on Saturday. Both players were sent to the sin-bin but replays showed that Tuilagi was the aggressor and landed three punches. Ashton, meanwhile, has revealed he will have surgery to his left knee next week. \"I've got to have an operation on my knee next Wednesday,\" he told the Daily Mail. \"I think it's just a clean-up job. Hopefully there's not too much to it but I don't think they'll know exactly what's there until they go in.\" The Gloucester centre Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu may find himself answering a disciplinary charge after he posted unflattering remarks about the referee, Andrew Small, on Twitter following their play-off semi-final defeat by Saracens. \"I would say the referee was a joke but I would probably get fined for it so I won't,\" he wrote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
