Concerns have been raised over \u201cbuy to leave\u201d properties, which are often owned by overseas buyers who do not use them for much of the year. In May, the Guardian revealed that 184 of the 214 apartments in the luxury central London development the Tower did not have anyone registered to vote and that almost two-thirds of the properties were owned by overseas buyers. The new mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has spoken out about buyers who use homes in the capital as \u201cgold bricks for investment\u201d. The research, by the estate agency Cluttons and YouGov, focused on a small number of high net worth individuals from Gulf states who were interviewed about their property portfolios. Of the 127 people who responded, 55% owned a number of homes around the world, and more than one in 10 said London was their city of choice for investment. Investors spoke of London\u2019s infrastructure and connectivity via frequent, direct flights to their home countries, and the political, economic and physical security offered by the city. A quarter of those who said they planned to buy a property in London said they were targeting capital gains rather than looking for somewhere to live or let out, while 22% said they were planning to buy to let. The Middle East Private Capital report, which will be published this week, found almost two-thirds of investors planned to buy in their favoured city during 2016. Cluttons said property values in central London\u2019s most expensive neighbourhoods had increased by 4.6% year-on-year while rental yields \u2013 returns from rental income \u2013 had averaged 3.72%. The agency said investors had benefited from 70% growth over the past seven years, and it expected cumulative capital growth of 19.1% over the next five years. Faisal Durrani, head of research at Cluttons, said: \u201cOur research confirms the sentiments of many that London is perceived to be lined with gold bricks with the residential returns outperforming mediocre stock and bond markets in recent years. This lock-up and leave attitude has been a political hot topic and often cited as a main driver of rising values and diminishing affordable stock.\u201d Durrani said investors from the Middle East were \u201cless sensitive to the Brexit uncertainty\u201d than those from other parts of the world. \u201cAdditionally, a third of respondents from Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia felt their local economies were worsening or destabilising, which has fuelled a desire to look for investment opportunities abroad with 65% likely to seek assets outside their own state. London is perceived as a low investment risk and historically popular with a legacy of investment data to support.\u201d Durrani said that while 47% of those surveyed were motivated by capital gains and rental values, a quarter planned to use their acquisition as a second residence for themselves and their family. \u201cHowever, it is undetermined how often these second residences are frequented,\u201d he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
