The meeting has caused squeals of protest from the territory's chief minister, who declared it \"democratically obscene\" that the two countries were discussing the rock's future without their participation. The status of the rock, which was seized from Spain in 1704 as a strategic military post, has long been a source of Anglo-Spanish friction. The joint summit comes ahead of prepartory meetings in a fortnight's time in Barcelona to discuss Gibraltar's future. The bulk of the two men's discussions were taken up with EU issues, such as completion of the European single market during Spain's presidency in the first half of next year, and the war on terrorism will also have been discussed. Earlier today Peter Hain, the Europe minister, reassured Gibraltans they would have a vote on their future and said Britain had an obligation to resolve the dispute. Gibraltan chief minister Peter Caruana suspects Britain is trying to reach a resolution with the prime minister Aznar in order to put Anglo-Spanish relations back on a level footing. He said: \"Mr Hain expects the Gibraltar government to go along to talks on the basis that we will be consulted, but that he and Spain will be free to agree whatever they choose over our heads. \"And we are saying, 'Yes, we will go to talks, but agreements require the agreement of all of us, and not just the two of you'.\" Gibraltar is due to boycott the talks - despite an open invitation - as they would have no power of veto on the other two nations. Gibraltarians complain that they are discriminated against, with long delays to leave the island and strict airport restrictions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
