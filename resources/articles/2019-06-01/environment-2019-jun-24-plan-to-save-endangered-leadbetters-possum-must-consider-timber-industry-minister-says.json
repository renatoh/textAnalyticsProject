But Ley has been criticised for suggesting a long-delayed recovery plan for the possum should also consider the needs of the timber industry. The possum, which was believed extinct until 1961 and is endemic to the Victorian central highlands, was listed as critically endangered in 2015 when then environment minister Greg Hunt accepted the advice of an independent scientific advisory body. But the government is yet to release a formal recovery plan for the species and its conservation status has been subject to a review since 2017, when Barnaby Joyce led a call for a \u201cpeople before possums\u201d approach to prevent forestry job losses. Scientists estimate the number of Leadbeater\u2019s possums has declined more than 80% since the mid-1980s as its habitat, mostly old-growth mountain ash, has been devastated by a combination of fire and logging. Almost half of it was lost in the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires. Victoria\u2019s state-owned timber agency, VicForests, says it is managing protection of the possum appropriately and many new colonies of the animal have been found in recent years. Ley told the ABC on Monday that she was \u201cencouraged by the forestry\u2019s willingness to engage in the possum\u2019s survival\u201d. She said her decision would ensure the animal received the protection it needed, including a 200-metre barrier around known nesting trees. She said it was important to strike a balance between conservation and the timber industry. \u201cI look forward to a recovery plan that takes into account the needs of that timber industry,\u201d she said. The Australian Conservation Foundation nature campaigner Jess Abrahams welcomed the minister\u2019s decision, but said the recovery plan must prioritise the environment \u201cThe science is really clear. The species is on the brink of extinction. Her job is to protect threatened species, not to protect threatened industries,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the minister needs to make sure she\u2019s got her priorities right.\u201d Abrahams said the case highlighted the weakness of Australian environment law, which requires that endangered species habitat be identified, but not that it be protected. He contrasted this with the US, which requires that habitat critical for endangered species\u2019 survival be identified and maintained. VicForests corporate affairs general manager Alex Messina said the organisation believed the possum could be protected while addressing both industry and environmental needs. He said it had been at the forefront of Leadbeater\u2019s possum research, helping identify hundreds of new colonies and extending knowledge about the possum\u2019s habitat. \u201cWe support undertaking further research to gain a greater understanding of Leadbeater\u2019s Possum numbers and where they live,\u201d he said. Environment group the Friends of the Leadbeater\u2019s Possum has launched a federal court challenge to VicForests\u2019 plans to log 41 forest coupes said to be vital habitat for the possum and the vulnerable greater glider. Ley also listed five Queensland frog species \u2013 the elegant frog, rattling nursery frog, Mount Elliot nursery frog, mountain-top nursery frog and the Bellenden Ker nursery frog \u2013 as critically endangered and a sixth, the tapping nursing frog, as endangered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
