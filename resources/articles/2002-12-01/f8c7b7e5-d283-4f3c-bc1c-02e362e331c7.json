He delighted in sharing that glamorous world with younger colleagues by taking them along to West End first nights whenever he had a spare ticket. His stock of showbusiness anecdotes was, of course, bottomless. \"He interviewed many starlets, but he had a particular soft spot for Helena Bonham Carter, who he considered the most beautiful of all English women. Like all good PA reporters, he had a comprehensive contacts book, and he could always came up with the goods when it mattered. He inspired great fondness in every one of us who worked with him.\" Richard Wallace, The Daily Mirror \"Rob always treated the showbiz beat with exemplary cynicism. After one particularly tedious lecture from a PR flunkey on what her client - I think it was a Baywatch star - would or would not talk about when they eventually turned up for a press conference, Rob raised his hand, cleared his throat and said in his trademark world-weary fashion: \"Can I just say that nobody here gives a flying toss. Frankly, they could come in and moon us and it still won't make the papers.\" Nigel Pauley, Daily Star \"I remember covering the Edinburgh TV Festival and, having flown up early, I was enjoying a drink at the George Bar after the opening lecture. Suddenly a red-faced Rob rushed in. Unlike the pampered Fleet Street hacks who flew to Scotland, PA's tight-fisted bean counters insisted that he took the train. (actually it was more expensive but, hey, it was PA). It also took quite a few hours more than the 60 minute plane ride, hence the late arrival. Rob was even more flustered when he couldn't find his hotel ... perhaps because it was in Dundee. A daft travel assistant at PA had thought that was the cheapest and best deal - hardly surprising, as it was about 50 miles away. After much hassle, poor old Rob finally managed to get them to switch to a cheapie hotel near Edinburgh airport. \"I think he resorted to crashing on fellow journos floors. I remember Rob as a gentle soul who always helped us by letting us file before his PA copy dropped (it made us look better at the office). Another time in Edinburgh, after a few free drinks at a bash, Rob walked into the George and slipped on some steps and fell flat on his face. I picked him up and helped him into a cab, but the driver was reluctant to take someone in such a state. I gave the cabbie a fiver fare and ten pounds extra to take Rob as a passenger back to his hotel. \"An hour later, having got second wind, Rob returned bright as a button at the George and could remember nothing of his earlier adventure, or the money! \"A jolly soul, sadly much put on by his bosses and probably much underrated by them too. He will be much missed. They should be ashamed.\" Anybody who would like to pay tribute to Rob please send in your best anecdotes to editor@mediatheguardian.com and we will gladly publish them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
