The 19-year-old American saw his dream of matching Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals sink last night just 24 hours after his even more extravagant ambition of exceeding it had been thwarted, and after finishing in the wake of Thorpe and Pieter van den Hoogenband he conceded that he was feeling the strain. \"It's a lot tougher than the trials,\" he said with the sort of innocent under statement that only a teenager could manage on a night when a $1m bonus promised by his sponsor had also drifted to the bottom of the Athens pool. \"How can I be disappointed when I swam in a field with the two fastest 200 metre freestylers of all time and was right in there?\" he said. \"It's a lot more emotionally draining than anything I have done before and it takes a lot out of you race to race, particularly tonight. When those guys are going so fast it makes it real exciting, but it's tough.\" Just how tough was clear from the times of the medallists. Despite producing a personal best in the weakest of the individual events he will swim in Athens, the American had no answer to the superior speed and experience of Thorpe and Van den Hoogenband, who played out a private storyline that for once in this Phelps-fixated week did not have the Baltimore prodigy at its heart. Despite knowing that his hopes of gold were slim in such specialist company, Phelps decided to swim the 200m freestyle because he wanted to judge himself against Thorpe, and after the ripples had stilled on the race of the century he acknowledged the Australian's excellence. \"His [Thorpe's] freestyle stroke is in my view the perfect stroke. I swam alongside him on Sunday night for the first time and I said to my coach afterwards, 'Wow, he makes big waves'.\" As Phelps was talking, the Australian supporters who had cheered Thorpe home were indulging in their umpteenth chorus of Waltzing Matilda in the bars at the main Olympic complex. The evident joy generated by Thorpe among his compatriots is something the American clearly covets. \"He has such a bigger profile in Australia than we do in the US,\" he said. Domestic indifference was something Phelps's assault on the ultimate Olympic feat was supposed to change. Drugs scandals having ripped the heart out of the US athletics team, he was long ago identified by the US networks as the man to make America fall back in love with the Olympics. Asked whether eight golds was impossible, he said: \"I don't know. It's tough, I can tell you that.\" Just how tough is something Thorpe, who deliberately restricted himself to six gold medal shots in Athens, could have told Phelps four years ago. \"I had an opportunity and I tried to do something that he [Spitz] did, but I didn't,\" said Phelps. \"When I started to swim I never thought I would have an opportunity to go for seven.\" For Britain's Simon Burnett there was no disappointment, only pleasure in having played a part. The 21-year-old from Oxford had not expected to make the final and his seventh place was a rare example of British overachievement in the pool this week. \"It was only when the PA started announcing the names that it hit me that I was in an Olympic final,\" he said. \"I was just happy to get the experience.\" Unlike Phelps, the Briton will have the luxury of gaining some more without the world watching."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
