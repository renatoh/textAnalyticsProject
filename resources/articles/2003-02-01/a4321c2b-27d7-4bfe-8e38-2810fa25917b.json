He was up before the Jockey Club disciplinary committee on Thursday and fined \u00a36,000 after being found guilty of breaching the rules on running horses on their merits for the third time in six weeks. But yesterday, the Jackdaws Castle trainer was back on a high with the victories of Rhinestone Cowboy and Keen Leader in their pre-Cheltenham races. Keen Leader's 30-length win in the Amlin Reynoldstown Novices' Chase was rendered meaningless as a test when his principal rival in the three-mile test, Jair Du Cochet, unseated Jaques Ricou at the fourth from home just as the race was developing. Moments after Keen Leader had crossed the line, Rhinestone Cowboy made decent novice hurdler Thisthatandtother look ordinary in the Kingwell Hurdle at Wincanton. If this across-the-card action was difficult to follow for those of us at Ascot - ludicrously these two important races went off at 2.40 and 2.45 - for O'Neill it was impossible as he was besieged by the press in the winner's enclosure. O'Neill said of French raider Jair Du Cochet's departure: 'It was a pity because we didn't learn a lot. I was very pleased with the way Keen Leader operated today.' Keen Leader jumps his fences fast and low and fell on his only taste of the Cheltenham fences earlier this season but he is now the clear favourite for the Royal &amp; SunAlliance Chase at the Festival. He is also prominent in the Gold Cup market and O'Neill was not prepared to commit himself about his plans for the horse. The trainer seems to have accepted Thursday's punishment, quipping about his brush with the authorities: 'It is a good job these two won as it will help to pay the fine.' That presumably means that he will not now be appealing against the punishment. Rhinestone Cowboy's saunter was a trifle more meaningful as last year's champion hurdler, Hors La Loi III, was left trailing in third and the time was more than four seconds faster than the novices' hurdle on the same card. Norman Williamson, who has not yet asked Rhinestone Cowboy to exert himself in a hurdle race, said: 'It rode a good race and he did everything I asked of him. This fellow has speed late in a race.' It now seems certain that Rhinestone Cowboy, whose only mistake was when he was untidy at the second last, will line up in the Champion Hurdle rather than the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. The stable also has the front-running Intersky Falcon in the Champion but all the bookmakers were sufficiently impressed to make Rhinestone Cowboy the outright favourite. Hills and Ladbrokes, who briefly went 3-1, report that they were knocked over in the rush, and cut him to 5-2. Mrs John Magnier's seven-year-old is an exciting prospect but Cheltenham is a different course to Wincanton and that sort of price makes no appeal to me. Guillaume Macaire's other raider, Douze Douze, suffered a similar fate to Jair Du Cochet. This time it was Benoit Gicquel who was dumped on his backside at the fourth fence in the Ritz Club Ascot Chase but it must be doubtful whether Douze Douze would have been able to touch the winner Tiutchev, who beat Geos decisively. Martin Pipe, who was sent Tiutchev by the Liars Poker Partnership to prepare him for a crack at the Nakayama Grand Jump in Japan in April, may now prefer to go for the Queen Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham. Young Devereaux finally gave in to his fragile legs and had to pulled up lame but his trainer, Paul Nicholls, completed a double at Wincanton with Festival-bound See More Business and Azertyuiop. Most people are excited by Rhinestone Cowboy but another horse is top of my tree. Murphy's Cardinal, winner of the three-mile Ascot United FC Novices' Hurdle, who could go right to the top.
