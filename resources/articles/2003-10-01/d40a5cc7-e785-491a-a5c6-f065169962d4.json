Both government and UK Sport officials believe the current system is too bureaucratic and complicated, with sports having to go to a number of different organisations before they receive any cash. As a result Tessa Jowell, the secretary of state for culture, media and sports, told sports bodies this week that 10 specific sports have been identified to receive funding from a single organisation run by UK Sport. Concern is growing, however, that the new funding system could be a cunningly disguised plan to reduce or remove funding for activities outside the 10 listed. The sports singled out are athletics, swimming, sailing, cycling, judo, gymnastics,canoeing, equestrianism, rowing and triathlon - the Olympic events at which Britain has most success. It is well known that UK Sport has suffered financially from a fall in the sale of lottery tickets, and this has had a knock-on effect on sport's funding. Now the sports not on the list are to seek assurances from the government that their funding will not be affected. They will also ask for the list to be extended, so they too can apply using the streamlined method. A source said: \"There is widespread concern that if you are not in the 10 sports that have been identified, eventually you could have your funding scrapped. We need to have assurances that this will not happen, and will be asking the ministers to provide this.\" The fears of many sports not listed were hardly allayed when Jowell said, during her speech to announce the changes: \"We will not continue to fund a plethora of organisations simply because they have always existed. Because it's there may work for mountaineers, but it does not work for the Treasury.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
