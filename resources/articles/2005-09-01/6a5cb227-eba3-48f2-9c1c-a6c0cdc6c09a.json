Compass, the world's biggest catering firm (and, lest we forget, the company which fed Turkey Twizzlers to schoolchildren) told the City a year ago that it had hit a few isolated problems, but they were being sorted and would not recur. Six months later chief executive Mike Bailey repeated the exercise and admitted Compass was still not quite pointing in the right direction. Yesterday he 'fessed up to a load more problems. Chairman Sir Francis Mackay announced his departure after profit warning No2, and yesterday Mr Bailey said he would go too, in 2006, but only after revealing plans to dump the SSL road and railside catering business which has sales of nearly \u00a32bn a year. This is a major change in direction for a company which used to parrot a mantra about building economies of scale - the same strategy and talk that comes out of its main rival Sodexho of France. Compass also disclosed plans to wind down its military catering business in the Middle East, which it used to boast about because of its relatively high margins. Mr Bailey was putting a brave face on his departure, saying it was time to spend more time with his wife and children. (Let's just ignore the fact that both his two sons are now in their 20s and at university in the US.) There was no \"immediate\" pressure from shareholders, he insisted, but investors we spoke to begged to differ. They are extremely concerned about what has been going on at Compass, even questioning the veracity of the accounts. There is no question of wrongdoing but it is a safe bet we have not heard the last of Compass. At the very least expect a kitchen sink job of industrial catering proportions from whoever inherits Mr Bailey's mantle. Economics lesson News that Britain has slipped a couple of places to 13th in the global competitiveness rankings, compiled by the World Economic Forum in Geneva, was greeted with predictable hyperbole from shadow chancellor George Osborne. The UK, he wailed, had plummeted since the glory days of 1997 as a result of Gordon Brown's red tape, high taxes and excessive meddling. So who came top of this annual - if not wholly scientific - look at where it is best to do business? Low-tax South Korea? It came 17th. China, where labour rights are minimal? Sorry, a lowly 49th. The de-regulated nirvana that is the United States? Nope, runner-up again. Looking down on the rest, for the second year running, was Finland, with Sweden third, Denmark fourth and Iceland and Norway both in the top ten. Sure, the WEF said, some businesses in Scandinavia were bellyaching about taxes (much higher than they are here) but there was \"no evidence that these are adversely affecting the ability of these countries to compete in world markets, or to provide some of the highest standards of living in the world.\" All this will be grist to Gordon Brown's mill. He has been looking on with wry amusement as Osborne has tied himself in knots by dabbling with a flat tax. The WEF yesterday handed him a fresh piece of ammo with which to send his young shadow the way of his six predecessors. According to the WEF's chief economist, Augusto Lopez-Claros, paying high taxes has allowed the Nordics to deliver world-class schools and universities, an extensive safety net and a top-notch, highly motivated workforce. You get what you pay for, in other words. Plasterboard wars BPB, the British plasterboard group fighting a \u00a33.7bn hostile takeover by France's St Gobain, is planning to return even more cash to shareholders in its bid to stay independent than the \u00a3350m already promised, its chief executive indicated yesterday. Cheekily, Richard Cousins chose a BPB plant 20km from Paris, and not much further from St Gobain's HQ, to challenge the predator to come up with \"a bloody big number\" rather than the 720p on offer. BPB is investing more than \u20ac100m in the plant, which provides 30% of St Gobain's plasterboard needs - a \"jewel in the crown\" St Gobain desperately needs to bolster its own profits. BPB is cash-rich and, a week on Sunday, in its final (day 39) document, it will obviously offer more to its purring shareholders. Cousins has kept some of the biggest onside, even claiming support from some of the hedge funds. At this stage of a bidding war the funds might normally control 40% of the stock, but they have only 15% of BPB. Jean-Louis Beffa, St Gobain's chief, will have to raise his own offer substantially if he seriously wants to win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
