Since they met in Orlando in the 1994 World Cup, their games have been drenched in binational carnivals of beer and brotherly love which, one Dutch novelist wrote, have otherwise only occurred in human history when proceeded by war. Before the match, both sets of fans applauded each other, and when someone blew a horn during the Dutch anthem, the Irish crowd hushed him. On the big occasions, Holland have always beaten Ireland. On the other hand, Ireland have not lost a competitive match at home during Mick McCarthy's six years in charge. Yesterday a draw was enough virtually to guarantee Ireland a place in the play-offs. But of their first choice defenders, only Ian Harte was playing, and he was carrying an injury. Facing Patrick Kluivert and Ruud van Nistelrooy was the central defensive pairing of Steve Staunton (an Aston Villa reserve) and Richard Dunne (a Manchester City player who, despite being only 21, was by far the fastest man on the pitch). Holland were so much the better side in the first 20 minutes, and missed so many chances, that one felt they were doomed. The game could have gone so differently had Kluivert, after simply dispossessing Harte and strolling up to Shay Given in the second minute, not shot narrowly wide. It could also have gone differently had Roy Keane received a yellow, or indeed a red card, for a flying tackle from behind on Marc Overmars in the first minute. So tense and aggressive was the start that by the second minute, after a foul by Kluivert, there was a ml\u00e9e of angry players. At this early stage, Overmars was surging past Gary Kelly at will, but his crosses have never been a patch on his running. There was a cavalcade of Dutch chances, coming with an ease most evident on 17 minutes when Mark van Bommel was allowed to collect a kick from Given and run nearly 40 yards straight at the Ireland keeper, who saved his shot. But a long pause for a head injury to Arthur Numan, after which Holland played several minutes with 10 men, ruined their rhythm. After that, Ireland were excellent. Robbie Keane and Damien Duff darted into gaps and received excellent passes, particularly from Staunton. By the break, it was Holland who were hanging on. As the second half wore on it became obvious that Holland, semi-finalists at France 98, were seeing their hopes of going to this World Cup disappear rapidly. It is likely that they will not qualify - and they don't deserve to. Even when Gary Kelly was sent off in the 58th minute after he collected a second yellow card when he clattered into Overmars from behind, Holland looked the worse side. For Ireland, Givens, was magnificent, cool, impassable, not the same person who has blundered for Newcastle United this season. Roy Keane was voted Man of the Match, but Given deserved it. Staunton commanded the defence, never letting Dunne get into trouble. The Ireland team is young and quick and fits together. McCarthy has done a better job than Van Gaal. This glorious generation of Dutch players will now never go to a World Cup again: Phillip Cocu, the De Boer twins, Edgar Davis, Overmars. How could this have happened to a team with Kluivert and Van Nistelrooy as their strikeforce? Arrogance and Portugal got them into this mess. Yesterday nerves sealed it, the team that plays some of the most fluid football in the world taken to assuming that turning up was sufficient for victory. Portugal, their equally fluid cousins, knew better. And this Irish team has brains and skill as well as guts. Unbeaten in four games now against Portugal and Holland, the Irish deserved it all. Van Gaal blundered with his substitutions, replacing his wingers Boudewijn Zenden and Overmars with centre forwards. For the last half-hour, Holland played with four natural centre forwards, using the style that suits them least and Ireland best: hoisting long balls forward. It was almost as if they wanted to prove that Dutchmen can't head. The hapless Pierre van Hooijdonk barely managed to touch the ball, while Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink ended up trying to play in the outside right position. These tactics were particularly strange given that Ireland had only one full back left. One suspects that Davids and Frank De Boer, both so bizarrely ruled out by the minute quantity of nandrolone found in their blood during drug tests, would not have let this happen. Their young replacements, Van Bommel and Kevin Hofland, were bags of nerves and without Frank De Boer, there was no one who could pass from the back. Sir Alex Ferguson's dismissal of Jaap Stam to Lazio appeared sage. Stam looked as unimaginative on the pitch as he is off it. His one shot barely reached the Irish goalline. The last half-hour was played in Ireland's half, but not in their penalty area. The public address announcement: 'Stewards to end of match positions, please,' drew a wild cheer. At the final whistle, Lansdowne Road shook. Irish players waved their fists at the crowd and screamed. Robbie Keane threw his shirt to the fans - it was caught by a Dutchman. The Dutch loped off one by one, none of them consoling another, their body language telling the story. If Ireland make the World Cup they will be a joy. It's not just Roy Keane, his namesake Robbie and Damien Duff are delightful players, and the sight of the fans carousing in Tokyo or Seoul would be astounding. The Irish provided half of the highlights of the World Cups of 1990 and 1994, and should they run into England I know who I would back on their current form. As a longstanding fan of Holland I want to say: 'Good luck to Ireland.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
