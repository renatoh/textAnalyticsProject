Michel Gondry\u2019s spiky-sweet comedy drama centres on two such 14-year-old outsiders: scrawny, girlish-looking Daniel (Ange Dargent) and more confident but jagged Th\u00e9o (Th\u00e9ophile Baquet). A pair of geeks who don\u2019t really fit in with their own families, let alone the Versailles high school they attend, they decide to run away from home. Sure, they have adventures, but all that hiding from cops, nearly getting beaten up by American-football-playing pimps and stalking girls is less the point to this delightfully picaresque story than the boys\u2019 budding bromance. As you\u2019d expect from Gondry, the characters are lovers of lo-fi technology, romantic dreamers with bad haircuts, who, when told they\u2019ve grown tall, reply that, no, the world has shrunk. Somehow, precocious adolescent boys seem the perfect fit for the irrepressibly playful Gondry. Like The Diary of a Teenage Girl, the film has been awarded a 15 certificate in the UK. That means British viewers the same age as the protagonists will be spared from finding out that French kids masturbate, draw their own pornography and discuss with their siblings the sounds of their parents having sex. But the fact that this film will struggle to find an audience \u2013 not just because of its classification but also because it\u2019s weird and sad and refuses to deliver any sort of message for young people \u2013 makes it all the more lovable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
