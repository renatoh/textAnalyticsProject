The UN's resolution 16/12 (March 2011) attracted more co-sponsors than almost any other since the creation of the Human Rights Council in 2006. Yet there are entrenched misconceptions in the UK that this is only a developing-world issue. A poll commissioned by the Consortium for Street Children and Aviva found that only 13% of British people realise street children are prevalent in western Europe and over two-thirds are unaware that an estimated 100,000 young people run away in the UK every year. More than one in five would be suspicious of crime at the sight of young people sleeping rough. On the International Day for Street Children, 12 April, we need to challenge these misconceptions. Whether they are a runaway from Derby or a street child in Delhi, the factors that drive children to the streets are similar. Once on the streets these children adopt many tactics necessary to survive such as begging, loitering and rough sleeping. Sadly, in many countries heavy-handed treatment by the authorities \u2013 such as violence and roundups \u2013 is all too common. Being a street child is not a crime. Today we want people to stand up for the rights of street children all over the world, by signing a pledge at www.streetchildrenday.org/take-action. This will be taken to a meeting with the UN in June, to ensure that street children's rights are not ignored.
