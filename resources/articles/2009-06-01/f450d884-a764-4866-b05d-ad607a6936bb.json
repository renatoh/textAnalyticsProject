In its annual fund manager survey, which analyses the voting patterns of institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers from July 2007 to July 2008, the TUC finds that shareholders expressed little concern about remuneration reports at banks' annual general meetings, even when the credit crunch had struck. HSBC was the only bank to receive less than 60% backing for its remuneration report from the 20 institutional investors studied in the survey. Brendan Barber, the TUC's general secretary, said: \"The theory is that in modern capitalism company boards are accountable to their owners, the shareholders. But this is far from what actually happens. Instead share owners \u2013 mostly ordinary people saving through their pension funds \u2013 have no say.\" The TUC survey also showed only one investor \u2013 the Co-operative Insurance Society \u2013 opposed the acquisition of ABN Amro by RBS in 2007, now seen as one of the worst deals in UK corporate history. \"The tragedy is that this system has been tested, with the result being the near destruction of the global financial system,\" said Barber. Despite all that had happened, he said, the City seemed determined to go back to \"business as usual\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
