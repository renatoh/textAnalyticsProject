Obviously, I'm joking about the North of England \u2013 at least until the government's spending review kicks in \u2013 but BBC4 identified a definite North-South divide in sport, action being markedly feistier north of the Trent. Admittedly that was in 1960, when David Storey's This Sporting Life was published. The novel featured heavily in the BBC4 programme 1960 \u2013 Year of the North, which stressed Storey's \"impeccable northern pedigree\". The writer was born in Wakefield, the son of a miner, and played rugby league for Leeds. In an archive interview, he recalled how his epoch-making novel was born when a ball landed at his feet during a game at Leeds and he realised that if he picked it up he would get his teeth knocked in. Frankly you cannot get more impeccably northern than that. Even that, though, was not enough for northerners sporting chips on both shoulders in the traditional fashion. Storey gave an interview at the time in which he claimed to live in \"working-class Hampstead\", which had folk up here spluttering into their pints of mild and cocking quizzical snooks at their whippets, believing \"working-class Hampstead\" to be a myth, like Narnia or the Widnes stockbroker belt. All Storey meant, I suspect, was that he was more Gospel Oakish than up by the Heath. The programme reclaimed Storey for the North and illustrated the difference between the sporting North and South of 1960 with contemporary newsreels, showing hats at Royal Ascot followed by rugby league at Wigan. I have to confess to being a sucker for this kind of stuff, and when it is accompanied by a soundtrack featuring atmospheric pre-Beatles pop, including Billy Fury's Wondrous Place, a captive audience is assured round my gaff. A couple of telling scenes from the film of This Sporting Life, of which regular readers will know I am an admirer, were shown. Despite Richard Harris's accent, which settles uncomfortably somewhere between Caerphilly and Cleckheaton, the scene in which his character, Frank Machin, signs as a professional for \u00a31,000, a substantial sum at the time, is beautifully done and still relevant today. As Stuart Maconie, an expert witness on the show, sagely observed, Machin is a man in a donkey jacket surrounded by men in suits. \"This pre-dates today's footballers,\" said Maconie. \"Just like Machin, young people usually from humble origins suddenly have to deal with riches being heaped upon them.\" When Machin is shown blustering aggressively in an upmarket restaurant, bolstered by his new fortune, it is not a million miles away from the popular urban myth of the Premier League footballer \u2013 choose your name \u2013 setting fire to fifty-pound notes in a nightclub. Adrian Chiles, hosting Arsenal's Champions League match on ITV, pointed out that no London team has ever won Europe's top prize, whereas the names of Liverpool, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa and Celtic are on the trophy, some more than once. The pundit Andy Townsend reckoned that while Arsenal might play pretty football in the early stages, they never seem to have the grit and determination to go all the way. It is probably too simplistic to put it down to a lack of the right sort of pies. In some countries, mind you, merely competing in international competition shows you are made of the right stuff. Transworld Sport on Sky told the story of the 21-year-old Kosovan weightlifter Orges Tafilaj, who receives no funding, is his own coach and appears to train by running round and round a small garrett and looking for weightlifting tips on the internet. Now he is proud to be blazing a trail for the young country, taking part in a competition in Turkey that he has no chance of winning. I do love these features on Transworld Sport, underlining not just the redemptive power of sport but the fact that whatever problems we face in the UK they are, to quote Tom Courtenay as Billy Liar in Year of the North, neither mickling nor muckling. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 September 2010. The original said that Iraq played West Germany in football's 1974 World Cup. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
