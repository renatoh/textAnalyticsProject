There is bound to be plenty of noise around Williams and it might not be easy for her to stay focused on her game. However, she has reached two grand slam finals since returning from giving birth and the seven-times Australian Open champion will be raring to go after missing last year\u2019s tournament. Caroline Wozniacki \u2013 No 3 seed The Dane, who revealed she has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis three months ago, returns to the scene of her greatest triumph with the pressure off after silencing her critics in last year\u2019s final against Simona Halep. Showed wonderful courage to fight back against Halep \u2013 but can she defend her title? Her Melbourne record was patchy before last year. Simona Halep \u2013 No 1 seed The Romanian\u2019s consistency took her to the top of the rankings while Williams was away and she finally ended her wait for a first major when winning the French Open last year. What a story it would be if she adds to her Roland Garros triumph after that agonising defeat by Wozniacki. Naomi Osaka \u2013 No 4 seed The Japanese youngster showed fantastic composure to stay calm when everyone else was losing their cool during the US Open final. Instead the 21-year-old used her power game to claim a first major title. Having climbed to No 5 in the world, Osaka will have high hopes of continuing her rise. Angelique Kerber \u2013 No 2 seed After struggling in 2017 the German\u2019s powers have returned. Losing the No 1 ranking seemed to have a liberating effect and she produced an outstanding performance to upset Williams at Wimbledon for her third grand slam title. She earned her first in Melbourne three years ago and the left-hander\u2019s form in the Hopman Cup suggests she will be a big threat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
