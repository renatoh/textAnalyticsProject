The Premier League champions know it will take more than a victory against a fragile West Bromwich Albion side to determine whether this is the start of a full recovery. Four matches in 10 days, against Liverpool, Olympiakos, West Ham United and Manchester City, will provide a much better barometer of United's health. That make-or-break sequence starts with Liverpool's visit to Old Trafford on Sunday, when Luis Su\u00e1rez and Daniel Sturridge will pose United's new-look defence \u2013 this was the first time Jones and Chris Smalling have started a Premier League match at centre-back together \u2013 far more problems than a toothless West Brom attack. As for the extent to which United trouble Liverpool at the other end of the pitch, much could depend on Robin van Persie's state of mind and whether the man wearing the No20 shirt is the prolific striker who inspired them to the title last season or the pale imitation who was substituted here after becoming a danger to his own team. Already on a booking, Van Persie invited a second yellow card with a lunging challenge. Television replays showed the forward got a touch of the ball before colliding with Steven Reid but it was nigh on impossible to tell that was the case in real time. David Moyes thought it was a foul and so did Jonathan Moss, the referee. Once Moss decided against brandishing a red card, Moyes could not get Van Persie off the pitch quickly enough. The United manager said he had told Van Persie before the game that he would be substituting him because he had played 90 minutes for his country in midweek. But the Dutchman's reaction when his number was raised \u2013 he shook his head and embarked on a slow walk to the touchline, prompting Patrice Evra, the United captain, to come across and console him \u2013 suggested that he was deeply unimpressed. Van Persie, however, could have no complaints. As well as being a sending-off waiting to happen, he was contributing little with the ball. Van Persie looked a picture of frustration at times or, to borrow Ronald de Boer's recent description, like a man who is \"not enjoying the football Manchester United play\". Although it was Van Persie's free-kick that set up Jones's opening goal, he failed to register a shot on or off target, touched the ball only 25 times and, for the second match in succession, made only one pass to Wayne Rooney. When the two ran into each other in the second half it summed up what their partnership has become. It also cannot have escaped Moyes's attention that United played with more fluidity after Van Persie was withdrawn and replaced by Danny Welbeck. Rooney, nodding in Rafael da Silva's measured cross, quickly made it 2-0, before setting up Welbeck for a well-taken third goal, sealing a comfortable win that was desperately needed in the wake of their Champions League defeat in Athens a couple of weeks ago. \"It wasn't a good result [losing 2-0 to Olympiakos in the first leg] and then the roof sort of caved in almost,\" Michael Carrick said. \"Everyone came out of the woodwork and criticised us but that's something you have got to deal with. We had a long time to ponder it. Even though lads went off around the world on internationals, it still doesn't get out of your system. That's why it was important for us to put on a good show. There had to be a reaction.\" For Albion, this was another day to forget in a disastrous season. They have won only one of their last 19 matches and have been sleepwalking towards the Championship for months. In his post-match press conference Pepe Mel, Albion's head coach, looked like a man who was half-expecting Jeremy Peace, the club's owner, to tap him on the shoulder and tell him his time is up. That moment could still come prior to Saturday's game against Swansea \u2013 the first of four successive matches against bottom eight teams. Peace ultimately needs to decide whether he trusts Mel, who has yet to taste victory in seven matches, with the task of negotiating a critical run of games that promises to go a long way to deciding Albion's fate or, in what would be an admission that he made a mistake by appointing the Spaniard in the first place, hands the responsibility for the remainder of the season over to Keith Downing and Dean Kiely, who were placed in temporary charge when Steve Clarke was sacked. Ben Foster believes Albion have the right characters to survive. \"We haven't got any fancy Dans or individuals that don't play as a team and that's important when it gets to the nitty gritty like this,\" the Albion keeper said. \"When you go a goal down we don't see our players dropping their heads and saying: 'Sack it, I can't be bothered'. We haven't got any like that and that gives me the confidence that we will be alright.\" Man of the match Rafael (Manchester United)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
