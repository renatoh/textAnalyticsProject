The result offered Shelley Kerr\u2019s team a glimmer of hope on their World Cup debut amid the heat and humidity of the south of France, with Claire Emslie\u2019s late goal restoring an element of Scottish pride after Nikita Parris and Ellen White had put the Lionesses two goals ahead. \u201cIt was good to get that game out of the way,\u201d Neville said. \u201cIt was always going to be emotional and it was really hot. We played really well in the first half, we knew Scotland would sit back and try to contain us but we started off playing very adventurously. \u201cWhen our legs got heavy in the second half, though, we let fatigue get the better of us. We have to keep driving standards higher and being ruthless but I loved every minute of it. I\u2019m really proud.\u201d After missing out on three World Cups as an England player Neville was going to enjoy the moment and had no truck with suggestions the opening goal, a penalty converted by Parris after the VAR system led to the referee reviewing a handball, was harsh on Kerr\u2019s players. Indeed the new rules allow no scope for a referee\u2019s discretion even if the offence lacked intent. \u201cWe\u2019ve been given two talks by referees before coming here, who both said incidents like that would be penalties,\u201d Neville said. \u201cI actually thought one just afterwards was more blatant.\u201d Parris won the award for player of the match but her manager was not getting carried away. \u201cWe\u2019ve challenged every player to be the best in their position and I think Nikita is someone with another 10% still left in her.\u201d Ditto certain colleagues. \u201cFor 20 minutes of the second half we stopped moving, stopped wanting the ball,\u201d Neville said. \u201cBut it was a tough environment.\u201d Kerr was left with mixed emotions. \u201cIn the first half we were really disappointing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a lot of credit must go to England I thought they were really good, especially in midfield. In the second we were better organised and it was much closer, so there are lots of positives. The pressure was off us when we went 2-0 down.\u201d Scotland\u2019s coach agreed the rules made it a penalty but still did not like the decision. \u201cI thought it was harsh. If it had finished 1-0, I\u2019d feel a bit sore.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
