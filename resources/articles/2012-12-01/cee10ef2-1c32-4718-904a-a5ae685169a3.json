Alongside the unrestrained tongue-lashings and gleeful smut on offer \u2013 the brash, brassy Lick Me Dry is a particular highlight \u2013 her self-released fourth album also finds her expanding her repertoire. On Turn You Out, Khia shifts gender as easily as the beat shifts tempo (while sounding uncannily like Kelis); Fuck a Promo finds her deliver an anthem of the precariat (\"Me work for free? That's a no-no\") with snappish authority. Her excursions into R&amp;B pay the most dividends, though: centrepiece Dickmatize is a glorious, six-minute smooth jam, all booming drums and ludicrous filtered guitars, while Fall Back is \u2013 of all things \u2013 a wistful tale of love lost that, naturally, ends with a finger-wagging, no-nonsense monologue. Khia has expressed a desire for \"gays to get married to this album, walking down the aisle kissing to it\". It deserves nothing less."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
