Kenwright received formal confirmation of a financial package last night which will secure the club's immediate financial future. The money will be injected via a share issue, with evidence of the availability of funds and the viability of the proposal received by the club's banker, Barclays. The influx will alleviate the pressure on the Merseyside club, whose debt is approaching \u00a340m, and even allow the manager David Moyes to add players to his threadbare squad. There have been 17 departures from Goodison Park this summer, and nine from the first-team squad, with only a trio of arrivals. That would have swelled to four had Jurgen Colin, the PSV Eindhoven right-back, not seen a season's loan move to the club collapse yesterday. Should the formalities of the new investment be completed by the end of the week, as anticipated, then Moyes's interest in the West Ham midfielder Michael Carrick and Rangers' Craig Moore, among others, will be revived. Confirmation of the deal represents something of a coup for Kenwright. There had been calls for the former deputy chairman - who formed True Blue Holdings with Gregg in March 1999 to buy a 70% stake in the club - to resign, not least from Gregg. Kenwright's future as chairman has effectively been secured, though his backers cannot be revealed until due diligence, which will commence on Monday, is completed by the end of the week. \u00b7 Tottenham last night entered the chase for Southampton's James Beattie, with the offer of Dean Richards and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 as part of an \u00a38m package. Southampton have been inundated with inquiries for their England international striker since he handed in a transfer request on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
