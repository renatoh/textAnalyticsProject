But then he was not under pressure to spice up the life of Dr Johnson to justify a huge advance from publishers looking to recoup much of their outlay from serialisation in the popular prints, which can be the only rational explanation for Roy Keane's crude, obnoxious and, one trusts, actionable admission that he deliberately injured his fellow professional Alf-Inge Haaland. Penguin books is rumoured to have paid about \u00a31.4 m up front to Keane and his ghostwriter Eamon Dunphy, money it could not realistically have hoped to recover in sales. So before a word was commissioned it would have been demanding to see examples of the sort of juicy titbit that has now cost Keane the last vestige of a reputation but has doubtless brought in a tidy sum in newspaper serial rights, which is how publishers offset those large advances. Anyone who has worked in this trade would understand the pressures to produce money-spinning copy. My own ghosted autobiography of the boxing promoter Frank Warren is still unpublished because a passage involving an incident with Mike Tyson is currently subject to legal restraints and, without it, the serialisation rights would be greatly diminished. Also, Warren rightly believes, unlike some movie stories, that an autobiography ought to be a one-off production and as such should be full and unexpurgated, as they are fond of saying on the flyleaves. Dunphy, who always painted himself as a misunderstood footballer and has since turned himself into a respected, if maverick writer, might have seemed an ideal soulmate and father confessor for Keane. But ghostwriting requires complete trust between star and author. And it is an open question whether Dunphy, an intelligent man who would have calculated the impact of the Haaland revelations, has earned that by allowing what amounts to an admission of premeditated GBH to enter this sad tome. One has to wonder how much time and care Keane, who does not come across as a man with a well thumbed library, took to read and digest the words written in his name. Surprising as it might seem, many subjects are happy to give their ghost carte blanche to turn their taped confessions into colourful unchecked prose but in those cases there is added responsibility upon the writer, and indeed the publisher, to draw their attention to passages that potentially can not only harm their reputation but lead to legal actions. Of course such books are not worth the paper they are written on if the reader does not believe that the sportsman is being completely straightforward about his or her life. But there are times when the writer has to act as a filter between brutal honesty and damaging, gratuitous admissions. George Best was so searingly honest about his failings when he and I worked together on Blessed that many people found it an uncomfortable read. But a writer must at times temper his instincts to reveal every morsel of an individual's life with the need to protect him from himself, which is why, after much agonising, we decided to omit a spicy anecdote which would also have been hurtful to another person. The writer Ian Ridley managed this tricky balancing act brilliantly in Tony Adams' much acclaimed autobiography Addicted. With a less sensitive and understanding co-writer, Adams' description of how he once wet himself after a drunken night might have come across as crude and boorish. But Adams' recounting of his painful descent into alcoholism, complete with every humiliating detail, evoked only sympathy and compassion, whereas Keane's tales of drunken nights out come across as boorish and yobbish. Naturally, the subject has final approval on what appears under his or her name and by all accounts Sir Alex Ferguson was the perfect collaborator for his book Managing My Life. He is said to have done much admirable research on his own life, continually penning thoughts and memories for use by the writer Hugh McIlvanney. But though such a meticulous approach was commendable, one has to question whether the book really needed his spiteful, hurtful comments about his former right-hand man Brian Kidd. Would not such observations, though undoubtedly honestly expressed, have been better left unsaid? Cooperating in one's autobiography does, of course, require a certain egotism and when someone dresses in a cloak of infallibility, as Ferguson and Keane clearly do, the feelings of others are easily dismissed. The sometimes unholy alliance between writer, subject and publisher can add to the distortion. The current proliferation of autobiographies reflects the high profile of all sporting activities. And as the ante is inevitably raised, there is an increased demand for revelations like Keane's. One of the secrets of a good ghost is to tweak his subject's musings into entertaining, credible prose, while resisting the temptation to lace it too heavily with his own, over-clever turns of phrase. In that respect, Dunphy has undoubtedly proven his success as a ghostwriter. The language used to describe the Haaland incident is crude, arrogant, sneering and yobbish. No one could doubt that it came from the mouth of Keane. From the bland... to the brilliant Book Steve Bruce - Heading For Victory Best anecdote Most exciting revelation was that Kevin Moran was \"a terrific fellow\" and invited the young Bruce round for tea. Moreover there was plenty of competition for places at a club the size of Manchester United. Great. Book Andy Goram - My Life Best anecdote Nigel Spackman apparently called the former Scotland No1 a \"fat bastard\" and Goram promptly punched him twice. \"In a team game such as football, there are always going to be little bust-ups because players want to win games,\" he said. \"It's all part of the territory.\" Book David Ginola - From St Tropez to St James' Best anecdote As a kid, little David would play every evening on the street with his mates, with their matches only ever interrupted if a car came by.

Book Peter Beardsley - My Life Story Best anecdote Practice matches during training at Liverpool would apparently get \"a bit tasty\", with the manager Kenny Dalglish's staff team ensuring that his side always \"pinched Barnesy\" and ended up winning. Book David O'Leary - Leeds United On Trial Best anecdote The furore was mainly whipped up over the tactless title and the fact that the board were apparently oblivious to their manager's intention of writing a book touching upon the Lee Bowyer/Jonathan Woodgate trials and tribulations. Book Kenny Dalglish - My Autobiography Best anecdote How he almost quit Liverpool in 1990 after Hillsborough, a year before he left. \"I didn't appreciate the scale of the pressure I was under.

I felt ashamed that I was reduced to taking other people's money.\" Book Paolo di Canio - An Autobiography Best anecdote \"I am fascinated by Benito Mussolini. Remember those mobile phone advertisements where they asked people who they most would like to have a one-to-one with? Ian Wright picked Dr Martin Luther King; my choice would have been Mussolini.\" Book George Graham - The Glory and the Grief Best anecdote The bung scandal exposed and explained, with Graham admitting he was \"guilty of stupidity and fleeting greed\" but was deeply frustrated after his ban that he had become a \"footballing leper\" and \"a sacrificial lamb\".
