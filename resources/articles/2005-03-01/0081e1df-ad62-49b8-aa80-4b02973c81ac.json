The apartments are family orientated so the atmosphere was friendly. Late-night noise was not tolerated and there was someone on the door all night. The complex also has its own pool and cafe and is a 10-minute walk from the beach and 15 minutes to where the action is. The girls did go to clubs most nights, but it is a safe place compared with our cities, with a good taxi service to get them home in the small hours. The most important thing is ground rules about not leaving anyone on their own and being responsible for each other. Angie Charles \u00b7 Five years ago at the age of 17, four friends and I took a coach from London to Penzance and stayed in the lovely YHA hostel at Land's End. There is an excellent bus service in the area during the summer and plenty of nice beaches and walks. Many UK youth hostels can be reached by public transport and all are in areas with plenty to do.
