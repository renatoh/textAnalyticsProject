Mike Ferguson is being taken to court for allegedly speeding on the A1 in Lincolnshire as he urgently ferried the organ from St James' hospital in Leeds to Addenbrookes hospital, Cambridge. The prosecution has provoked condemnation from David Hinchliffe MP, who chairs the Commons health select committee, ambulance workers' unions and a man whose life was saved by an organ donation. But Lincolnshire chief constable Richard Childs said the case could clarify traffic law relating to vehicles carrying organs for transplant. Mr Childs said in a statement that he and his officers had been \"very upset\" by some of the criticism of the case, which he refused to discuss for legal reasons. He said: \"Deciding which cases to prosecute and which not to is a fine balance. Sometimes the decision, whilst the right one technically, may not be the right one in the eyes of the wider community until the broader issues are in the public domain. \"All I can do is to make it very clear that we consider saving life the most important thing we do. To suggest that this case compromises that principle is unfair, deeply hurtful and wrong.\" As the law stands, ambulance drivers transporting patients are exempted from speed limits under the Road Traffic Regulations Act 1984, as are police and fire engines. Vehicles carrying blood and human organs, however, are not included in the act and so, have to obey speed restrictions. Lincolnshire police have said that examination of a case like Mr Ferguson's in a magistrates' court could lead to a change in legislation. Mr Ferguson, a senior driver with West Yorkshire metropolitan ambulance service, had been due to appear before magistrates in Grantham, Lincolnshire, this morning but the case was adjourned until June 11. The ambulance driver indicated in a letter through his legal team that he would plead not guilty to the charge. The 56-year-old, who has an unblemished record of more than 30 years' service, could lose his licence and even his job if the prosecution goes ahead. He had been in an official vehicle with blue lights flashing when police spotted him in Lincolnshire and neighbouring Cambridgeshire at 3.30am on January 16. Mr Ferguson said: \"I can't help but feel that it's the UK transplant service that could suffer from this. \"I wouldn't dream of speeding unless it was an emergency but with some organ transplants, time really is of the essence.\" Kidney patient Steven Traylor, a former miner who underwent a transplant five years' ago, last night said he was prepared to pay any fines and the legal costs of the case. The 44-year-old father-of-two, of Church Village, south Wales, said he was \"enraged\" to hear of the ambulance driver's situation. He said: \"I'm supporting the gentleman wholeheartedly. I just find it pathetic.This gentleman should be supported by all the organ transplant patients. \"If it wasn't for the ambulance service, I wouldn't be here.\" The paramedics' union, the GMB, and Unison, the biggest union representing ambulance workers, warned that lives could be lost if emergency drivers had to follow speed limits. The GMB has written to the home secretary, the health secretary and other MPs calling for a review of the legislation. A crown prosecution service spokesman conceded that the current guidelines could be \"ambiguous\". But Chris Rudge, medical director of UK transplant, said livers should ideally be transplanted within 10 to 12 hours. \"It is not an absolute science but the longer they are stored, the more likely it is that they will fail,\" he said. \"It is an absolute disaster if an organ is wasted. A donated organ is such a precious gift.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
