Van der Sar, twice the European goalkeeper of the year and a Champions League winner with Ajax and United, turned 39 last week and has a reputation as the consummate professional. Kuszczak, however, is so exasperated by his colleague's lack of guidance the 27-year-old has publicly spoken out about what he perceives to be the failings in their relationship. \"To be honest, I must say this, and Edwin doesn't like this too much, for sure, but he doesn't help me too much,\" he said. \"I have told him a few times already to give me some more advice because he's got more experience and got many more games under his belt. \"I say to him: 'You have to give me something more because I like to know what I do wrong'. I like to watch other people because doing that I can take some good from the advice I get. But I don't know, maybe Edwin doesn't like me. You'll have to ask him.\" For a player to question a colleague's conduct is virtually unheard of at Old Trafford now that Roy Keane has left the club, and it is unlikely Kuszczak's comments will go down well with Sir Alex Ferguson given the manager's famous desire to keep everything in-house. It is even more embarrassing for United considering that Kuszczak made his complaints on MUTV, the club's own television channel and the outlet for the infamous diatribe from Keane against his own team-mates that eventually led to the then captain leaving the club in 2005. Kuszczak signed from West Bromwich Albion in August 2006 and the Pole is clearly frustrated about his inability to put together a substantial run of games as he competes with Van der Sar, the undisputed first-choice, and Ben Foster, who is marginally next in line. \"I've not played too much over the last three years,\" Kuszczak added. \"I hope in the future the games will come. The question is how long do you want to wait? I try every day but it's a slow process and it's not easy. I feel great in the position but I'm not called up and sometimes you think: 'OK, it's difficult, you have to wait', but the question is how long. I've already waited three and a half years. \"I will wait longer but my ambition is so big and I want to have a nice feeling after games, be tired and go home and think: 'Oh, you did a good job'. This is what I want to do. Now it's difficult because I haven't played too much, especially this season, but I'm hungry to play games. I have played a few games in the Champions League and Premier League, some important games, and it was OK. I know I'm able to do it.\" Kuszczak and Van der Sar would be far from the only goalkeepers not to have been close over the years. Jens Lehmann hardly had a good word to say about Manuel Almunia when they were competing for the same position at Arsenal, describing it as a \"humiliation\" to lose his place to the Spaniard and saying he watched games having to \"clench my fist in my pocket\". David James has admitted cold-shouldering Brad Friedel when the American signed for Liverpool, while Ronald Waterreus used to switch on the television in the middle of the night to make sure his PSV Eindhoven room-mate and rival, Georg Koch, slept badly before games. At Barnsley, meanwhile, the former goalkeeper Lars Leese remembers unnerving his rivals for the position by bombarding them with as many unstoppable shots as possible in training sessions. After he had fired another ball into the net, Leese would say: \"Oh sorry, I forgot you weren't good enough for shots like that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
