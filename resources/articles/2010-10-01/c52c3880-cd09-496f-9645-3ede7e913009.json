In 1989 I became the last director of the Crown Suppliers; my task was to close it down. This was an organisation that carried out many of the very activities which Green now identifies as best done centrally. The Crown Suppliers bought or commissioned the purchase of furniture, office equipment, floor coverings and related goods for all government departments. Many of the products were of standard designs so as to achieve increased economy of scale. When the Crown Suppliers was closed, responsibility for these matters was devolved to individual departments. There may have been some co-operation between departments subsequently, but clearly Green feels there is much still to be gained. In parallel, there was an organisation, the Property Services Agency, which provided buildings for government use either by renting facilities or commissioning new build. It was also responsible for maintenance. In both organisations there were professional staff to secure best outcomes, balancing first costs, costs in use, and durability. Both organisations, under many different titles, have worthy histories. Plus \u00e7a change. Robert Gomme London \u2022 We were both buyers of goods and services for our civil service departments. We started when there were two heavy-hitting centralised buyers, Her Majesty's Stationery Office and the Property Services Agency. They had huge contracts to let and knew what they were doing. They got seriously good value. But the suppliers squealed with pain and protest into the receptive ears of governments from Thatcher to Brown and, despite the resistance of the unions, the result was the destruction of exactly the purchasing power and expertise that Philip Green has just discovered to be a good thing. Each ministry had to cobble together a little, lowly regarded buying division with small, often complicated contracts to let at the mercy of unscrupulous firms. This fragmentation meant that the taxpayer has subsidised these suppliers, with the approval of government, for over 30 years \u2013 and now Green suddenly spots that it wasn't the smartest thing to do. Mary Pimm and Nik Wood London \u2022 HMSO ran just such a central purchasing service from 1822 until 1996, when its trading functions were privatised by John Major's Conservative administration. HMSO was retained with a much reduced role \u2013 maybe the coalition could just give it back its old job.
