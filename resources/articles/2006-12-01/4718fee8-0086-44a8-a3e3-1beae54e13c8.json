This leads to lots of lovely shots of the wildlife expert following said creature across Exmoor while wearing a waterproof suit illustrated, it would appear, with photographs of leaves. World's Strongest Man Super Series 8pm, Five Few sights are as gratifying as that of a bald man in a unitard dragging a lorry through a Scandinavian car park in the manner of an overweight horse. This year's qualifying rounds - held in Connecticut, Moscow and Miliscz - will see a brilliant international squadron of fat-calved bruisers competing in rounds with names such as crucifix hold, tyre flip, and, tremendously, \"Conan wheel\". I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! 9pm, ITV1 Regrets? They've had a few. Like the time Jan Leeming said she'd get her granary loaves out for Playboy. Or that moment when a shower-bound Toby Anstis started frantically scrubbing at his naked crotch, as if it was the meaning of life that lurked behind the soapy film of Adidas Dynamic Pulse, rather than merely the genitals of a 35-year- old DJ. Tonight, then, marks our final chance to bask in the warm glow of celebrity self-delusion, before Fate - or at least two laughing Geordies in Stone Island leisure wear - casts the jungle blunder-party asunder. Use it wisely. Simon Schama's Power of Art 9pm, BBC2 This week Schama peers at Pablo Picasso, who, peering back, decides he likes the cut of the boffin's jib and makes a mental note to ask him out for an omelette. Dismissing the critical brouhaha and vapid self-obsession that characterised the artist's early career, Schama's scholarly antennae start to twitch when it comes to Guernica, the Spaniard's astounding response to the Luftwaffe's 1937 annihilation of a Basque town. It helped, he intones, to \"rescue modern art from its own clever-ness\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
