For someone such as Luke McLean, who grew up in Brisbane and played alongside David Pocock and Will Genia in the 2006 junior Wallaby side that won the Under\u201119 World Cup, the omens are not great. Trotting out in the blue of Italy this weekend does not exactly improve the odds. So why did McLean sound so cheerful aboard the Italian team bus on Thursday as the Azzurri headed for the airport to catch their flight to London? It is because Italy know they cannot wallow in the disappointment of last week's agonising near miss against Ireland. \"For a couple of days there was a bit of depression,\" McLean says. \"But now it's put fire in our bellies and convinced us that, if we stick to our gameplan, the results will come.\" As he expanded on his firm belief that Italy could yet have a good tournament, it was easy to understand why the bearded full-back already has 25 Test caps at the age of 23. His 75th-minute try against the Irish, while not a match-winning effort, was precisely what the Italians yearn to do more often: employing their forward power to create space for backs with sufficient wit and subtlety to turn that pressure into points. It may not be enough to beat England this year but, rest assured, Italy will take some knocking over. McLean, who was born in Brisbane and qualified for Italy through his grandparents, is among those convinced that, one day, the Azzurri will come to Twickenham and confound rugby tradition. The margin in Rome last season was a mere five points and nine of that Italian side are involved once more. They are also reinforced this time by Sergio Parisse, their world-class No8. \"It gives you confidence,\" McLean said. \"Their team has changed a little but not too much. I also think our boys have taken a lot from playing in the Magners League this season. It has meant the best Italian-based players have been playing together at a higher level more often. We've now got a core of 20-25 players who have been around for a few years.\" The reorganisation of Italian domestic rugby into two teams \u2013 Treviso and Aironi \u2013 will start to pay real dividends in \"a couple of years\" according to McLean. The head coach Nick Mallett agrees: he is very proud of the three Under-17 academies which now exist and has been heartened to learn that 22,000 more Italian youngsters are now playing rugby. \"It has been a real struggle \u2026 it's been very hard to keep the national team competitive,\" Mallett, who is also encouraged by the Magners initiative, said. \"Without that there was no way forward for Italian rugby. Even now for Italy to win any game is a massive achievement, because we never play against a team lower than us in the IRB rankings. But at least there's now a path for young players. We have been building for several years and this year we hope to see the results.\" It will also be a sign of maturity when Italy no longer have to trawl the world to recruit the likes of McLean, who played for the Souths club in Brisbane and Perth Spirit before signing for Calvisano in 2007, having turned down a training deal with the Western Force. Not that McLean is remotely bothered by such a prospect as he prepares to face England's fliers, having already played against Ben Foden last season when Treviso met Northampton in the Heineken Cup pool stages. \"He's a good player and England have been playing some good rugby, in a different style to what they've been renowned for. Give them any space and they're going to make you pay. It's a matter of turning up and having our heads switched on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
