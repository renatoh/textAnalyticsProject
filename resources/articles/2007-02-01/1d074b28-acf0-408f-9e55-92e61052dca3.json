It was quite a leap for a paper that cannot bring itself to print the word \"tit\" without an asterisk in the middle, despite a pair of them appearing daily on page 3. But it was all in a good cause, declared the paper, which said each of the 11 children had suffered from racism \"like Celebrity Big Brother winner Shilpa Shetty\". It was time for the abuse to stop. Hardly the most obvious Sun front page, but then the Mirror had the exclusive interview with Shetty - boosting sales by 160,000, it turns out - so it had to come up with something. It might have struck a more sincere chord had it not appeared in the paper that almost four years ago to the day provoked accusations of racism with its spoof series of Mr Men characters who, it said, epitomised life under new Labour: Mr Yardie, a black gun-toting Rastafarian smoking a joint, Mr Asylum, a toothless vagabond who wants everything for free, and Mr Albanian Gangster, who carries a knife and invites men to meet his \"friends' sisters\". Presumably that was part of the \"light-hearted playground stuff\" which the Sun mentions in its leader, pointing out: \"It's bigotry all the same.\" But the Sun's call for tolerance appears not to have reached its columnists. Take Jon Gaunt, who never tires of telling Muslims to \"fit in or ship out\". He twice had a go at \"pikeys\" last year, described by the Sun last week as \"one of the most offensive and ugly words in the English language\". His fellow columnist Kelvin MacKenzie was also at it. \"Travellers, otherwise known as pikeys to you and me,\" he wrote last May. Only last week deputy editor Fergus Shanahan branded Goody: \"Queen of the Chavs. She's a chav. This is how chavs behave. Stand on any street corner and you will hear yobs like Jade, Jo and Danielle in action.\" Tell that to 12-year-old Sean Callen, one of the children featured on the front page who hates the insult \"chav scum\". \"White people can be victims of bigots too,\" says Sean. But back to last week's Sun leader. \"The impact on society of offensive labels can be dangerous. Shunned minorities retreat into ghettos and nurse their grievances. At a more sinister level, as new polls show, it splits society and turns thousands of young Muslims into al-Qaeda sympathisers.\" In other words - don't insult them, they might blow us up. John Plunkett Magazines Rich pickings for some US glossies Over the past decade they have become a coffee-table staple, whether in the clapboard retreats of the Hamptons, or the Floridian villas of Palm Beach or the beach-side estates of Santa Monica. Magazines geared toward the US rich and would-be rich have increased more than fourfold since 1997, according to the latest edition of a leading publications register. The 2007 Standard Periodical Directory shows there are 456 such titles compared with just 90 10 years ago. These niche luxury-extolling publications tend to follow the same blueprint, heavy gauge paper resplendent with lush photographs and features on high-end products such as mega-yachts that enable the owners to keep up with the Joneses in the St Tropez marina, and jewellery so costly that an escort of armed guards is needed every time it is worn outside the house. And of course they include the obligatory coverage of exclusive events; as the rich and famous like nothing more than seeing their expensively beautified faces in an expensive magazine. The proliferation of glossies such as Worth - which proclaims itself as \"the magazine that examines the concerns of families with wealth\" - has been fuelled by America's appetite for luxury goods, which some analysts forecast could be worth $1 trillion by 2010. One in 40 Americans is a dollar millionaire. But a large audience is not the goal of such magazines. Worth is one of the 15 luxury titles in the Malibu-based CurtCo Media stable. CurtCo's flagship publication, The Robb Report, has around 100,000 readers and is among a number of titles that have trimmed their print-runs and increased advertising rates in the past as a way of boosting exclusivity. Annual subscription for the monthly Robb Report is $65 (\u00a333). But much of the market uses controlled circulation, distributing free magazines in the haunts of the rich, such as luxury hotels, boutiques and showrooms. This means the publisher avoids the high cost of chasing greater circulation and the advertisers know they are reaching their target audience, those who can afford and are likely to buy the products they advertise. The ad rates in the niche luxury magazines also tend to be less than in larger circulation titles, which reach a broader yet a less wealthy overall audience. In the US, around 40% of all new magazines survive the first year. So with so many titles available in a market based on exclusivity, any new publication that is geared toward the \u00fcber-wealthy is in for a tough time.
