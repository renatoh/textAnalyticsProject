Emotions run high over fate of Loch Lomond\u2019s beloved banks", "bodyText": "On the banks of Loch Lomond, a battle for cultural supremacy has been joined as intense as the Jacobite skirmishes that sanctified this soil 300 years ago. The largest inland expanse of water in Great Britain has been at the heart of Scottish culture and commerce for thousands of years. At its most northerly it announces the Scottish Highlands, while the most southerly point is barely half an hour\u2019s drive from Glasgow. Now, a southerly stretch of its bonnie banks is in ferment once more. A corridor of parkland bounded by trees near the village of Balloch is at the centre of a planning row which has evoked deep feelings about Loch Lomond sparked by a million childhood memories. Flamingo Land, a leisure company that owns a theme park in Yorkshire, has been given preferred bidder status to develop 44 acres into a holiday complex. The announcement sparked a furious online response from all over the world. It seemed unthinkable that a portion of Scotland\u2019s history could be given to a firm whose name evokes something from a 1980s George Michael pop video. The company\u2019s prospectus mentions the ubiquitous hotel, lodges and \u201cglamping pods\u201d as well as retail opportunities and adventure activity. They stress that, though they operate a theme park with adventure rides, their plans for Loch Lomond will bear no comparison. \u201cIt will not be a theme park,\u201d a company spokesman said. To date, more than 30,000 signatures have been gathered by 38 Degrees, the petitions website. A cursory glance at the reasons for objection offers an indication of what many people instinctively felt when the development was announced. Curiously though, the Scottish Campaign for National Parks which seeks to protect some of Scotland\u2019s wild and open spaces by having national park status conferred upon them is relaxed about the development \u2013 for the moment. James Fraser is a director of the SCNP and is also chair of the influential Friends of Loch Lomond. Few other people know this area as well as he does. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are unfortunate connotations with the name Flamingo Land. If they had been called something like \u2018Forest Trail\u2019 this wouldn\u2019t have elicited anything like the heat. \u201cI completely understand why so many people have been alarmed at what\u2019s being proposed. But I think that many people have reacted without being aware of the history of this site. It comprises three parcels of land which had previously been in industrial use and which had only itself been re-generated recently to create a small park and trees beside the water.\u201d Scottish Enterprise, Scotland\u2019s national economic development agency, which named Flamingo Land as the preferred bidders, has been painted as the villain. Yet it only stepped in to buy the land after a local campaign had prevented it becoming a building site for new houses. The land was always designated for economic development so long as it was in keeping with the surrounding environment. The local community has also been broadly supportive. Residents and retailers in Balloch recently held a meeting to discuss ways of rejuvenating a beautiful but economically fading neighbourhood. The village stands at the end of a corridor of water that links it to the larger loch. The village wants to gain better access to the loch and, if the Flamingo Land plans are approved, it could provide the jobs and attractions that will attract visitors who want to stay in the area for more than just a day. Michael Wright, of Scottish Enterprise, is not duly concerned about what is being proposed and feels that it will provide an economic opportunity in an area that had been neglected. \u201cThis land was always going to be redeveloped. The first stage was the development of Loch Lomond Shores which had formerly been used as a gravel pit. This is the second stage and, though it will involve the felling of some trees, some of these were felt to have obscured desirable views of the greater loch.\u201d Loch Lomond\u2019s global status does not rest simply on its beauty and the grandeur of the peaks that surround it. When Glasgow was at the height of its industrial powers, factory workers would arrive here by their trainloads to camp, swim and fish. The loch occupies a special place in the affections of urban, working-class families who grew up beguiled by sights and smells never encountered in their normal lives. Fraser is adamant that he and the Friends of Loch Lomond would \u201cstrenuously oppose\u201d any development that was not faithful to the beauty of Loch Lomond or to the memories of generations of Lowland Scottish families. \u201cThis part of Dunbartonshire is an unemployment blackspot and, so long as the development is carried out properly and sensitively, there\u2019s no reason why the local community shouldn\u2019t want to derive some economic benefits from it.\u201d There are others, though, who oppose the idea of any development in an area of such unspoilt beauty. In recent years, popular feeling prevented a windfarm development at Loch Ness and every step of a major housing development in Aviemore is currently being disputed On Thursday morning through driving rain and leaden skies it was still possible once more to behold the unique splendour of this place. The site of the proposed development is several hundred yards back from the loch itself, the views of which are obscured by trees. In the final analysis, Loch Lomond\u2019s worldwide appeal will probably ensure that the development, when it happens, is as pristine, sustainable and sympathetic to the surrounding environment as anything containing \u201cglamping pods\u201d ever could be. A free consultation would tell them that the name Flamingo Land must not be seen in the vicinity of this place. DEFENDING THE LAND A controversial windfarm development above Loch Ness by energy company E.ON was scrapped in June, delighting locals at Fort Augustus as well as protesters, who claimed the scheme threatened the area\u2019s fragile ecosystem. In 2015 the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park authority was accused of a \u201ccover-up\u201d over the resignation of one of its leading members for failing to declare shares in a gold mining company. Protesters say the goldmine, near Tyndrum, poses a danger to the surrounding flora and fauna. Plans for quarrying near the New Lanark Unesco world heritage site 30 miles south of Glasgow at the famous Falls of Clyde caused an uproar in 2013. The proposal was ditched by the Scottish government after a petition signed by 10,000 people. This article was amended on 5 October 2016. The first paragraph originally said Loch Lomond was the largest inland expanse of water in the United Kingdom. It is the largest in Great Britain: Loch Neagh in Northern Ireland is the largest waterway in the UK."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
