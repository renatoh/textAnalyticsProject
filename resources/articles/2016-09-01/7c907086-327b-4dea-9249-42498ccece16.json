Neither did Gary Cahill. When Philippe Coutinho got the ball back from James Milner in the 17th minute of this high-profile collision, following a short Liverpool free-kick, Chelsea\u2019s surprise homecomer and his central defensive partner could only survey the wreckage around them. In their eyeline was a gaggle of four ball-watching Chelsea team-mates, occupying nothing but empty space while behind them were a group of threatening Liverpool players. David Luiz seemed to freeze while Cahill resembled the little Dutch boy with his finger in the dyke. It was a complete breakdown; the sort to give Antonio Conte nightmares. Coutinho\u2019s delivery was perfect and Dejan Lovren applied the finish. Lovren was back in the Liverpool team after the massive black eye that had kept him out of last Saturday\u2019s home win over Leicester City but it was Chelsea\u2019s defenders who were seeing the stars on this occasion. David Luiz\u2019s comeback game for Chelsea formed a significant sub-plot, following his big money return from Paris Saint-Germain, and he had been a key ingredient of the buildup, with one line from Conte having stood out. The Chelsea manager had spoken about how it was his task to improve David Luiz\u2019s concentration levels. Lovren\u2019s goal was not down to David Luiz \u2013 far from it. The concession represented a collective meltdown. But it was the sort of thing that Conte is keen to eradicate, as he attempts to stamp his mark on the club. It set the wrong sort of tone for his team and, when Jordan Henderson advanced his contender for goal of the season, David Luiz and Chelsea were staring into the abyss. It said much for the disjointed nature of Chelsea\u2019s first-half performance that they were booed off at the interval. Chelsea were better in the second half and, with Diego Costa prominent, they hinted at a comeback. But after the striker had finished smartly from Nemanja Matic\u2019s cutback, Chelsea created only one further clear chance. It fell to Costa but, on this occasion, he could not beat Simon Mignolet. There was a moment with time almost up when Eden Hazard won a free-kick on the edge of the Liverpool area and David Luiz stood over it. The script had been written for him to pull something out of the fire. But it was torn up just as quickly. Cesc F\u00e0bregas, the substitute, stepped forward and he sent his kick into the wall. For David Luiz the emotions had swirled all evening and his return, whichever way it was dressed up, was an extraordinary story. There was the clear sense that Chelsea had been happy to cash in on him two years ago, when PSG came calling, and the same impression that the French club were only too ready to hand him back. There was also little doubt that Conte had other central defensive targets in mind over this past summer. He had scoured Serie A and even inquired after Marquinhos at PSG. He, though, was the club\u2019s first-choice selection alongside Thiago Silva. But Chelsea could have their first reserve, if they wanted \u2013 for \u00a334m. What an assignment this was for David Luiz; a fiery baptism against a Liverpool team that shimmered with attacking menace, even without the injured Roberto Firmino. There was a touch of deja vu. The 29-year-old had made his first Chelsea debut against Liverpool in February 2011, as a substitute in a 1-0 home defeat. His next game against Liverpool had ended in another home defeat and it was the time he heard that stinging criticism from Gary Neville, who said it had looked as though he were \u201cbeing controlled by a 10-year-old in the crowd with a PlayStation\u201d. Neville was in attendance again here, in his capacity as a Sky pundit. Liverpool have not been David Luiz\u2019s easiest opponents and he was bashed up and bloodied after a first-half aerial collision with Sadio Man\u00e9. The Brazilian\u2019s general performance was solid, marked by that familiar chest-out strut, the sweatbands on both wrists and the crazy hair bouncing all over the place. He saw a lot of possession and his decision making with it was generally on point. He passed with plenty of fizz and, although not every one of them came off, many of them did. David Luiz\u2019s charisma has been missed and he was welcomed back with warmth by the Stamford Bridge fans. Before kick-off he was reintroduced as the man who had won the Champions League, the Europa League and the FA Cup with the club. He waved at the crowd and smiled that smile. He appeared consciously keen to keep things simple, with no swashbuckling runs or any kind of wackiness. Unfortunately for him and Chelsea, the evening was not without its defensive blemish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
