In other words, those seeking radical surgery after the defeat in Paris are set to be disappointed. At least one change is guaranteed to the much criticised side who lost to France, as Martin Johnson is suspended, but a squad member with a strong case for promotion to Saturday's XV argued yesterday that Woodward would do best to offer a chance of redemption to those who slipped up at Stade de France. It would be distinctly harsh to drop Joe Worsley or Kyran Bracken, outstanding at times this season, on the strength of one bad game. The management's most obvious concern, moreover, is the fitness of Jason Robinson, who underwent lengthy treatment yesterday on a lower abdominal injury sustained playing for Sale against Wasps on Saturday. With Matt Perry out with a back problem, Woodward has a conundrum at full-back. Leicester's Tim Stimpson, who has started only one Test since the southern hemisphere tour in 1998, has been promoted from the A team as cover but the management could equally reinstate Bath's Iain Balshaw or, more daringly, switch Austin Healey to No15. Healey's experimental outing in that position for Leicester last month was inconclusive, yet Woodward's oft-stated goal is to select his best players regardless of the numbers on their backs. Danny Grewcock, meanwhile, should return in place of Johnson. A reshuffle has also been required in the A team where the London Irish flanker Paul Gustard has been called up to replace Declan Danaher, a late addition to England's squad for the Hong Kong Sevens. As for Wales, spared naming a side drawn from players outside the \"gang of six\" leading clubs, the caretaker coach Steve Hansen has recalled Gareth Thomas and Colin Charvis in a 23-man party, with Thomas expected to start in the centre ahead of Saracens' Tom Shanklin. The Swansea flanker Charvis returns after being axed by Hansen's predecessor Graham Henry for opting for a holiday in Jamaica ahead of preparations for the game in Ireland. \"Everyone is excited about the challenge ahead of us,\" said Hansen, who will name his starting line-up tomorrow. \"They [England] are a great side and this is an opportunity for us to assess where we are.\" Wales : Morgan (Swansea), R Williams (Cardiff), James (Bridgend), Morgan (Cardiff), G Thomas (Bridgend), Shanklin (Saracens), A Marinos (Newport), Jones (Llanelli), Harris (Cardiff), Howley (Cardiff), Peel (Llanelli); Thomas (Ebbw Vale), John (Cardiff), Anthony (Newport), McBryde (Llanelli), B Williams (Neath), Gough (Newport), Moore (Swansea), Wyatt (Llanelli), Budgett (Bridgend), Charvis (Swansea), M Williams (Cardiff), S Quinnell (Llanelli, capt). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
