According to a European Union financial transparency system, commission staff spent \u20ac22,193 (\u00a317,610) staying at the five-star Shangri-La hotel in Singapore and \u20ac54,677 at the five-star Stamford hotel in Brisbane in 2014. Other expenses listed that year include \u20ac439,341 on Abelag/Luxaviation, a luxury private jet provider, and \u20ac23,696 on chauffeur taxi services. Priti Patel, a Brexit campaigner, said European commission officials were \u201cgetting away with living the high life at our expense\u201d. Other European commission spending included \u20ac2,228 at the Restaurant de Watermolen in Antwerp and \u20ac7,450 at the Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli dining rooms of the Atelier Euro in Brussels, \u20ac2,500 at the European Golf Club and \u20ac907 at Club Zaudin Golf. The European commission did not deny the figures, although it said some other expense items cited by Vote Leave were \u201csimply absurd and some inaccurate\u201d. A spokesman said: \u201cEU officials travel for work, the vast majority of the time in economy class and bound by strict rules. They have to pay upfront and are only reimbursed afterwards, if those strict rules allow it. \u201cOnly the president and commissioners have permission to use (rented) private planes and it is the exception rather than the rule for use when scheduled air travel would be more expensive or does not allow them to meet the itineraries they need to meet.\u201d It is understood that some of the hotel expenditure was for staying at official locations for international summits. For example, the Stamford hotel was the accommodation designated for the European commission delegation during a G20 summit in Brisbane. Other spending on restaurants is likely to be for official functions. However, Patel said the spending uncovered by Vote Leave was unacceptable. \u201cMost families have been hit hard since the financial crisis, having to tighten their belts to make ends meet. But EU officials are using our money to fund their jollies and exorbitant expense claims,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only way to stop your money being spent in this way by EU bureaucrats is to vote leave on 23 June. If we leave the EU we can take back control of the \u00a3350m a week we send to Brussels and instead we can spend it on our priorities like the NHS.\u201d The dossier is likely to be inflammatory at a time when UK voters are deciding whether to leave the EU. The European commission, headed by president Jean-Claude Juncker, is the civil service of the EU and is based in Brussels. It is separate from the European parliament, which is made up of elected MEPs whose expenses are accounted for separately. This year Juncker said the commission would largely stay out of the EU referendum debate in Britain. However, last month he warned that \u201cdeserters\u201d would not be welcomed back if the UK voted to leave. \u201cIf the British should say no, which I hope they don\u2019t, then life in the EU will not go on as before,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UK will have to accept being regarded as a third country, which won\u2019t be handled with kid gloves. \u201cIf the British leave Europe, people will have to face the consequences \u2013 we will have to, just as they will. It\u2019s not a threat but our relations will no longer be what they are today.\u201d European politicians and officials have begun to be more outspoken about the potential consequences of the UK leaving since the polls in the contest have narrowed, with leave appearing to overtake remain. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said on Monday that if Britain votes to leave it could be the \u201cbeginning of the destruction of not only the EU but also of western political civilisation in its entirety\u201d. In an interview with the German newspaper Bild, Tusk said Brexit would boost radical anti-European forces who would be \u201cdrinking champagne\u201d to celebrate. \u201cWhy is it so dangerous? Because no one can foresee what the long-term consequences would be,\u201d he said. Spending on luxuries by the European commission was first uncovered in 2011 by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. It found that the office of Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, then president of the commission, racked up a \u20ac249,000 bill for private jets in a nine-month period during which he attended the 2009 UN convention on climate change. The bureau also found that Barroso and 35 others spent \u20ac28,000 at the luxury Peninsula New York hotel during the visit to the climate convention. It found that public money was used to fund a \u20ac75,000 cocktail party at a science conference, Discovery 09, which was \u201cfilled with wonder like no other \u2026 with trendy cocktails, surprising performances and top DJs\u201d, while much of Europe was in the grip of recession. The commission funded \u20ac300,000 worth of events described in internal documents as cocktail parties in the same year. At least a further \u20ac1.2m was spent on hotel and conference costs in 2009, including stays in San Diego, Prague and Balmoral."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
