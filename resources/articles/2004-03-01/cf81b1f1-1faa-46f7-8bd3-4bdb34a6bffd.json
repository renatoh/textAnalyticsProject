Thanks for all your emails and please join me again at 2.35pm tomorrow afternoon for the next instalment in this gripping match. Night. 10.40pm They're going off for bad light after two balls of Harmison's second over. Smith seemed to be having problems picking up the ball, the umpires consulted, and that, it appears, is that. Assuming it is - and I'll hang around for a few moments, just in case - then West Indies will resume tomorrow at 8-0, an overall deficit of 20. \"Rob had better hurry,\" points out Steve Hart, \"or he'll not make it for last orders.\" 3rd over: West Indies 8-0 (Gayle 8, Smith 0) Hoggard goes up for a gut-wrenching shout for leg-before against Gayle, but umpire Bowden correctly rules that one - a yorker - was slipping down the leg-side. Tino Best wasn't so fortunate in the first innings. The umpires keep consulting about the light - these are testing times for Gayle and Smith. Even so, Gayle doubles his score with a cut for two, then doubles it again with a dreamy on-drive for four against the swinging ball. \"Well, Rob,\" says Dido, \"two main things distinguish me from Elton: 1) I have a better wig, 2) You know as well as I that Elton drinks in the Red Lion, not the Dog and Duck.\" 2nd over: West Indies 2-0 (Gayle 2, Smith 0) Harmison greets the first-innings centurion Devon Smith with a bouncer, and keeps him on the back foot for the rest of the over. 1st over: West Indies 2-0 (Gayle 2, Smith 0) Hoggard bowls the first over and almost knocks back Chris Gayle's off-stump with one that swings back into the left-hander. Gayle opens his account with two to fine leg. Good first over. \"How will I distinguish between you and Elton John, though, Dido?\" writes Rob Smyth. 10.15pm In theory, there are 13 overs left to bowl, but I don't think we'll get many more than about five - just enough time for England to take an early wicket or two. Amazingly, Dido has taken Rob Smyth up on his offer. \"I'll see him in the Dog and Duck,\" she writes. \"I'll look for the ginger mullet, Rob, you look for the multi-million selling recording artist, alright?\" I think I've just made a little lad very happy. WICKET! Harmison run out (sub/Hinds) 13 (339 all out) Hoggard picks out the sub Ricardo Powell in the covers and for some reason Harmison decides there's a single on offer. Hoggard disagrees, but by the time Harmison realises, he's halfway down the track. He turns with all the agility of a tank, but is well beaten by Powell's return to the bowler, Hinds. England are all out for 339, a lead of 28. 103rd over: England 339-9 (Hoggard 9, Harmison 13) Two more to Harmison, who drives Sanford down the ground with hitherto unseen elan. He then smears two more to third man, before pulling the last ball of the over for four! Like Queen Victoria, Sanford is not amused. Neither is Richard Porter. \"You know, all these post-grad students (and the occassional easy-listening female vocalist) make me, a mere lowly undergraduate, feel like the scum of the earth. WAAAAAHHHH!\" Good grief, Richard. Pull yourself together. This won't do at all. 102nd over: England 331-9 (Hoggard 9, Harmison 5) Harmison picks up two jammy runs off the inside edge as gets into a tangle against a Hinds yorker, then sweeps him sweetly to long leg for a single. Wonders never cease. The lead is a handy 20. \"I'll be there,\" says Rob Smyth in reponse to, ahem, Dido Armstrong. \"Dog and Duck on Peckham High Street for last orders? Tell her I'm the one with the ginger mullet.\" Actually, Rob she's already lost interest, but I decided not to put up the relevant email because, well, I like you. 101st over: England 328-9 (Hoggard 9, Harmison 2) Steve Harmison opens his account with a shovel to square-leg off Sanford for one run. Harmison then calls Hoggard through for a quick single after Hoggy jams out a single. All contributions gratefully received at this stage, and Harmison obliges with a smeared drive to backward point for one more. \"I'm not sure if the anodyne Carthagian queen of pop is worthy of one such as myself,\" writes Anthony Moore. \"Blatantly I wouldn't be spending Saturday night alone and working in the thriving metropolis that is Sheffield if my attributes were that brilliant, hence the addition of the word single at the end of my description.\" Point taken, Anthony. 100th over: England 325-9 (Hoggard 8, Harmison 0) By the way, the ball before the dismissal of Jones, England picked up two byes, taking extras to 60 - outright top-scorer! That was Hinds's first Test wicket. WICKET! Jones c Sanford b Hinds 7 (325-9) Jones slices a slog to Adam Sanford at cover and thoughts of a 30- or 40-run lead evaporate. 9.52pm Here come the players again. Brace yourselves. 9.50pm As we wait for the resumption of play (irritating downpours permitting), here's Alison Jeeves, who insists she wasn't being sarcastic at all. \"Oh no, your commentary is by far the most interesting thing that has happened to me tonight,\" she says with a hint of sadness in her voice. \"Although I have now got chips so things have perked up.\" Chips. Hmm. Beats the banana I've just scoffed. 9.48pm \"You do realise that if you succeed in balancing your second TV, myself and Paul will be expecting a dual minute-by-minute account, part on the cricket, part on the football,\" writes Matthew Cobb. \"You may explode with the effort.\" Bring it on (he dribbled deliriously)! 9.46pm The umpires are having a quick look at the pitch, so I hope to be able to tell you soon that play will be resuming. \"The most extras in a Test innings is 71 by Pakistan against West Indies at Georgetown, Guyana in 1987-88,\" reports Steve Hart. \"The 58 extras in the current England innings is joint-14th in Test history.\" And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a fact. 9.45pm Well, it's still drizzling, but they still seem to be taking the covers off. Unless my eyes deceive me, which after several hours alternating between a TV and a computer screen is entirely possible. \"Cheers for the words of encouragement Matthew,\" writes Anthony Moore, \"but you are obviously far more of a self-disciplinarian than me, as I can't resist reloading the page every two minutes to see what has happened next, and of course to read the next pithy comment by some other addict. For Christ's sake, I'm 26, intelligent, handsome, articulate and single - what the hell am I doing here on a saturday night? I should be out on the tiles with my undergraduate housemates. Has it really come to this?\" Is modesty one of your many qualities, Anthony? If so, I think \"Dido\" might be interested. 9.40pm I think the covers might be coming off. I think. Here's Alison Jeeves. \"It's been all go since I went away (stuck out in the cold doing the guest list, since you ask). Coffee creams, liquid architecture and dido. How exciting.\" Is that sarcasm I detect, Alison. No room for sarcasm here, y'know... 9.35pm So, two and a bit days to go, and England have the most slender of leads. If they can eke out another 30 or 40 runs - optimistic, perhaps, but humour me here - and then take two or three early wickets, including Lara, then you never know. Whatever happens, the pressure will be on the Windies more than England when the third innings starts. I don't know about you, but I'm licking my lips. It's \"Dido\"! Rob, I knew it would work (see over 95). \"Hi Lawrence darling, Dido here,\" she begins (and I can almost hear her sing it!). \"Who's this Rob fellow asking after me? I am single - Rob, can you get down to London tomorrow.\" Shame, \"Dido\" - Rob's in the Caribbean. 9.30pm The rain is falling steadily, but at least England are in the lead this time. Almost everyone has chipped in, and the West Indies are without their main strike bowler. Life isn't too bad, really. \"What were you planning to do from 2.30 onwards?\" wonders fellow Manchester City fan Matthew Cobb. \"Does Guardian Towers offer you the possibility of watching more than one TV? If not, I will be listening to GMR and am happy to mail you in key events in our valiant attempts to shaft United more or less as they happen. The Temple of Doom has to turn into Our Place someday, and tomorrow is as good a day as any... I won't say anything about the cricket for fear of doing the old t of f. (Now we know why Paul Headon is so aware of this dangerous habit - he's another Blue!).\" I'm going to try to balance one TV on top of t'other, Matthew. Wish me luck. 9.25pm Incidentally, one of those Sanford bouncers to Jones was called a wide, which means that extras is now joint-top-scorer on 58 with Mutcher and Hussain! 9.23pm It's raining once more, and the players leave the field. Annoying. In the meantime, here's Dan Roe. \"My Dad is the only person I've ever met who can stand coffee cremes. So naturally, when the traditional Chrismas box of choccies was handed around, the conniving old git would take anything but, because he knew damned well that once the box was picked clean of anything any normal person would regard as edible, he'd get all the disgusting coffee-flavoured Sweeties From The Selection-Box Of Satan that were left at the bottom.\" 99th over: England 323-8 (Hoggard 8, Jones 7) Jones swipes Sanford through the covers for four - a stroke of abandon reminiscent of his cameo against India at Lord's on his Test debut in 2002. He almost breaches the infield next ball too, but a clean strike heads straight for mid-off. Shame. Sanford retaliates with two bouncers, but Jones just ducks and smiles. A swing at the fifth ball falls just short of mid-off. He then takes a single to point off the last ball of the over. \"Maybe Anthony and I should join forces and write about the role of cricket in urban regeneration,\" suggests Hana Loftus. \"It works in India. Maybe the Essex greenbelt really needs more village cricket...I see there is a gap in my researches.\" 98th over: England 317-8 (Hoggard 8, Jones 2) Hinds is getting some turn as he comes in from over the wicket to Hoggard, who seems unsure whether to use his bat or his pad. In the end, he gets by with a bit of both. A maiden. \"Can I just say to Anthony and Hana that the Guardian cricket coverage is brilliant for results,\" writes Matthew Wassell. \"I did my MSc dissertation to the Ashes cricket coverage overnight with Lawrence and co. and...I passed! Well just about anyway!\" 97th over: England 317-8 (Hoggard 8, Jones 2) Hoggard pinches the strike with a single to mid-on off Sanford. He has now faced 54 balls for his eight, and England lead by six. Fascinating stuff. Odds update from the ever-dependable Steve Hart: \"11/4 West Indies, 8/11 Draw, 11/4 England.\" I knew I should have taken England at 4/1... 96th over: England 316-8 (Hoggard 7, Jones 2) Jones scurries through for a single off Hinds, and Hoggard collects a leg-bye. Replays show that Tino Best had a word with Giles as he trudged back to the pavilion in the last over. Giles responded with an unpleasantry and the umpires had a word with Best. Lovely byplay, as Geoff Boycott would call it. Mat Wrigley writes with an update from Grenada. \"I have just got back from a relaxing lunch on La Sagesse beach,\" he gloats, \"and have got the Caribs in in anticipation of a fascinating final session. Fusing the coffee and Italian themes of today, did you know that the lidderal translation of the coffee-based pudding, \"tiramisu\" is \"pick me up\"?\" 95th over: England 314-8 (Hoggard 7, Jones 1) The left-handed Jones takes a single first ball into the covers. Any runs now are a bonus. \"PS: Thesis title,\" writes John Walsh. \"The Relationship Between Surfactant Chemical Structure and Liquid Crystal Architecture\". Exciting eh?\" WICKET! Giles b Sanford 27 (313-8) The ball after England take a first-innings lead with a square-drive for three by Hoggard, Sanford gets one through Giles' defences. The Barmies' cry of \"You're not singing any more\" lasts all of three seconds. \"I reckon these minute-by-minute things have taken over from shopping aisles as the place to meet your future spouse,\" says Rob Smyth. \"Don't suppose Dido's online following the cricket?\" Hang on, Rob, I'll check. Dido! Dido! You there? 94th over: England 310-7 (Giles 27, Hoggard 4) On comes Hinds, with his dinky left-arm spin. Odd. Giles plays a cute little sweep-paddle over his left shoulder for two runs. And England trail by a single run. \"I would like to stand up in defence of coffee chocolates,\" argues Richard Porter. \"The Coffee Creme in Roses is absolutely delicious, ditto Quality Street.\" 93rd over: England 308-7 (Giles 25, Hoggard 4) The Barmy Army are singing now, which usually means a wicket is about to fall. But no, Giles drives Sanford square for four - nice. The next ball brings a single to deep backward point. Good stuff from England. Peter Richards has found out all about jokelhaups. \"The ice moves about 5 m each day but most of that is lost to the calving of icebergs. Eventually, the ice succeeds in damming the channel causing the water level on the southern arm to gradually rise about 40 m. When water level reaches that height, the water has sufficient head to float the ice off of the bottom, resulting in a catastrophic draining of the southern arm back to its original level. This jokelhaup carves a tunnel (seen in the photo below) upward through the ice. Instability of the floating ice causes it to break up and retreat back across the channel. The complete cycle takes about three years.\" I like the \"(seen in picture below)\", which in no way suggests a blatant cut and paste from some specialist website. Thanks all the same, Pete. 92nd over: England 303-7 (Giles 20, Hoggard 4) Giles runs a single to third man off the long-suffering Collymore as the countdown to first-innings parity continues. Collymore decides to goround the wicket to Hoggard, which isn't a bad move. But it's hard trying to remove a stubborn tailender whose only aim in life is to block, block, block. Eight runs in it now. \"Two words,\" writes Paul Headon ahead of tomorrow's Manchester derby. \"BLUE MOON! Here's to Gary Neville making a complete fool of himself again. What a shame the Goat isn't around to take advantage - I hate pinning my hopes on two fat Scouse wasters and a moody Frenchman.\" Your words, Paul. Not mine. 91st over: England 302-7 (Giles 19, Hoggard 4) Giles scrambles a leg-bye, before Sanford induces another edge off Hoggard, only to see it drop short of the slips once more. These are frustrating times for the Windies. They could really do with the raw pace of Fidel Edwards, but he's off the field with a sore back. \"Three weeks?!\" scoffs John Walsh. \"Howsabout 11 years! Here I am in my works library (been in here for 20 hrs every weekend since mid-Jan) trying to finish the b******d. Started in '93 (before mobiles, the Internet etc), didn't start writing until '97/98. Stopped in Jan 2000, done naff-all from then until Jan'04. I've got some making up to do to my wife, I can tell you.\" Sounds like she's a patient woman, John. The PhD had better be good. 90th over: England 301-7 (Giles 19, Hoggard 4) Corey Collymore to Matthew Hoggard, who is still getting resolutely in line, even if every instinct in his body is telling him to retreat to square-leg. The fourth ball flies off the outside edge, but dies and lands three yards in front of second slip. A maiden. Well played Hoggy. \"Hi Lawrence,\" begins Anthony Moore. \"I'm using your report as an excuse not to write my MSc essay on the role of communities in housing regeneration. I've spent all day doing it and have managed 443 words so far. Tell Hana she is not alone in having a crap Saturday night for the good cause of Urban Regeneration.\" 89th over: England 301-7 (Giles 19, Hoggard 4) Here we go after tea. Can England sneak into a first-innings lead? Adam Sanford (14-0-55-0 before this over) takes up the attack to Ashley Giles, who is fortunate to pick up four runs off a thick edge that eludes third slip and then ricochets off Ramnaresh Sarwan on the third-man fence. Doh! The next ball is wide and Giles crashes another boundary off the outside edge to bring up the England 300. Vital runs, these. \"Why was coffee ever invented as a filling for choccies?\" rages Sammy in Nottingham. \"There is no one I know who likes them, so why are they in every box of chocolates know to humanity? I reckon it's part of the long-term American resolution to the Cuban Missile Crisis: having agreed to take the entire Cuban coffee surplus every year until the Guantanamo Bay lease, the yanks have forced every western government to include it in coffee creams and the like, as well as in Trident.\" Hadn't thought of that, Sammy, but now you mention it..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
