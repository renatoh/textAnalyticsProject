Through the final gasp of Thatcherism, the Major years, the hope and disillusion of New Labour and the chilly decade of coalition and Tory austerity, he has stuck to his environmental principles and resisted the urge to vote tactically. Until last month, that is, when at a party meeting in his constituency of Chingford and Woodford Green, Roads was one of a number of members to suggest their candidate stand down to help elect Labour\u2019s candidate. The move \u2013 which was adopted \u2013 did not delight the party\u2019s leadership, but to Roads, a retired teacher and musician, there was no doubt that it was time, at last, to change his vote. Why? \u201cWell, because this seat has now become marginal,\u201d he says, \u201cand I really would like to see the end of Iain Duncan Smith, who I think is a dreadful man.\u201d Roads and his wife, Judith, also a retired teacher and musician, moved to their bay-fronted semi-detached house close to the North Circular ring road that runs through suburban north-east London, in 1971. They are concerned about policing and how long it takes to get a doctor\u2019s appointment, ashamed of the need for food banks and of the fact that homeless people are now common even here. But it is the prospect of Brexit \u2013 which appalls them \u2013 that has driven them to drastic measures. \u201cEven if the worst comes to the worst and we get that dreadful [Boris] Johnson again, if we could at least get Duncan Smith out it would be a Christmas present,\u201d says Judith. Chingford and Woodford Green is not the kind of seat where one might expect dramatic electoral reversals. This has long been deep blue Tory country, the current constituency made up of seats whose previous MPs include Norman Tebbit and Winston Churchill. Duncan Smith has been MP here for 27 years, during which time he has (briefly) led his party, been a key architect of austerity \u2013 most notably the loathed universal credit \u2013 and an outspoken advocate of hard Brexit as a member of the ERG. But since 2010, his majority has been steadily shrinking, and Labour now scents blood. The party\u2019s candidate, Faiza Shaheen, has an army of hundreds of activists and a seductive backstory \u2013 an Oxford-educated economist who grew up in a working class family in the constituency and has vowed she will never stand anywhere else. One profile described her as \u201cBritain\u2019s AOC\u201d \u2013 referencing another young leftwing woman who ousted a longtime incumbent \u2013 and at least one polling research company has identified Duncan Smith as being in \u201cvery serious jeopardy\u201d on 12 December. With Epping Forest and some leafy corners of Essex on its borders, there are certainly parts of the constituency that are extremely comfortable, their streets lined with grand, mid-century villas and big cars. Other areas, however, are much less flashy, and like many suburbs of the capital and other big cities, this is an area in transition, with families and individuals priced out of central London moving in to an area busy with construction \u2013 and bringing their politics with them. Walthamstow, where Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy has a huge majority, is just to the south, and despite Chingford\u2019s ultra-Brexiter MP, the constituency voted by a knife-edge margin for remain in 2016. * * * The effects of austerity, in any event, can touch anyone. Anne Haysman lives with her husband and 16-year-old son, Freddie, near Chingford\u2019s smart high street, an area where, she acknowledges, most people are comfortably off. But Freddie is severely autistic, and Haysman has seen his access to specialist short-break care \u2013 giving him somewhere to play safely during weekends and school holidays \u2013 being slashed as government funding for the Labour-led local authority has been cut by \u00a3120m since 2011, even as demand for special needs and disability provision has risen by 20%, according to the council. The result, she says, is that \u201cfamilies like ours find it\u2019s very hard to have their kids around all day with very little for them to do\u201d. Her son, she says is mischievous and stubborn, taking great pleasure in the things he enjoys like swimming and being outdoors. But as he gets older and physically stronger, she feels less confident taking him on outings by herself, \u201cand so one of the things he ends up doing is spending a lot of time inside watching YouTube videos\u201d. Closing a few play centres for children with special needs \u201cmight not seem like a massive thing, but it is all chipping away, making life, which is already difficult, that bit more difficult\u201d. She is angry, she admits, and concerned about what happens when Freddie leaves school at 19. \u201cEveryone tells me that if you think things are bad now, adult social care is much worse.\u201d Despite some reservations about Corbyn, Haysman will vote Labour, and says that, for her, it feels particularly personal. \u201cI do think so, because if you vote Tory you are voting to make the lives of people who are struggling, people with disabilities, you\u2019re making their lives more difficult.\u201d Having witnessed a serious assault in the middle of the afternoon earlier this year, Haysman is also concerned about crime and policing \u2013 a theme which, in a Guardian callout to constituents that received more than 200 replies, came up again and again. Woodford police station is one of almost 100 that have closed to the public in London since 2012; the number of Metropolitan police officers assigned to the wider Waltham Forest area fell by more than 10% in the two years to 2018. Stories of burglaries and car crime were common from those who contacted the Guardian \u2013 one respondent said casual crime was \u201cevident and even expected\u201d near his home in Woodford. It\u2019s a concern felt keenly by Lee Marcu, whose barber\u2019s and tattoo shop the CutFather sits opposite a large retail estate in Highams Park, to the south of the constituency. Having opened the shop two years ago aged just 24, he would love to see some help for small business owners from the new government. But after being burgled twice in the past year, his biggest concern is crime. Nothing much was taken from the till \u2013 he does not keep his takings in the shop overnight \u2013 but with \u00a31,200 excess on his insurance, it wasn\u2019t worth making a claim to replace his damaged door, locks and, in one case, \u00a3400 worth of products. \u201cI\u2019m just a young business owner trying to make a living. If someone breaks in, you can end up spending thousands, and no one knows about it.\u201d Marcu doesn\u2019t like to blame the police, but who could help? He has begun asking his neighbouring shop owners and even residents if they\u2019d like to chip in to pay for private security, though the logistics of making it happen, he is finding out, are complicated. \u201cI\u2019m not being funny, but I\u2019m here 10 hours a day, six days a week, I\u2019m working, working, working \u2013 and for small business owners like myself to have to go out and create a neighbourhood watch \u2026 I just feel we are having no backing from our [politicians].\u201d He will definitely vote, he says \u2013 \u201cI think everyone has to vote\u201d \u2013 but has no idea how. \u201cI believe everyone has to do their research, but I\u2019ll be honest with you, at the minute I am not happy with whatever I am seeing on the news.\u201d There is no denying, however, that there are some \u2013 perhaps many \u2013 in the constituency, who are broadly content with the direction of travel of the previous government, and would like to see more of the same. Steve Holman, a graphic designer, moved to Woodford Green with his wife about 20 years ago, and while his street has certainly changed in that time, \u201cwe all get on, it\u2019s still got a nice feel. If you are out washing your car on a Sunday afternoon, people will stop and say hello.\u201d He was in two minds on Brexit in 2016, he admits, but ultimately voted to leave, and feels increasingly frustrated that it has not happened. \u201cBecause there is a feeling people want Brexit done, and IDS is known for that, I think he will get the support.\u201d Fundamentally, Holman believes, Chingford and Woodford Green is still Tory at heart. \u201cIt feels like one of those areas where people have a sense of getting on, working hard, owning your own property. It all sounds very cliched, but it\u2019s true.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
