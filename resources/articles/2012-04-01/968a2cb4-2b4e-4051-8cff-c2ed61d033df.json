Andy Farrell, their head coach, is wanted by Stuart Lancaster to serve in his England regime, but Farrell has a day job with Saracens that they insist is incompatible. \"We will have more discussions this week,\" said Edward Griffiths, Saracens' chief executive, of a negotiation that was begun on Friday, the day after Lancaster's appointment. \"It is not very complicated to work out what the discussions are about, but the default position is that he is the head coach of Saracens, which is how it will stand if the discussions are not successful. We would like an early settlement, because we don't want any will-he-won't-he distractions going through the Clermont week.\" The Clermont week means now, what with Saracens preparing for their Heineken Cup quarter-final against Clermont Auvergne at Vicarage Road on Sunday. Griffiths, once again, made it clear that he considers such commitments with a club to be as much as any man should have to deal with. \"We have previously ruled out [a job share with England], because we think it is difficult to do both jobs. Maybe there was a different set of circumstances with Shaun Edwards [who juggled such commitments with Wales and Wasps].\" All of which leaves things tantalisingly poised and Farrell in a most awkward dilemma. Likewise Saracens, who lent England their up-and-coming coach for the Six Nations as a kind of favour. They, more than anyone, should have known he was going to do such a fine job. \"Obviously, anyone would jump at the opportunity to coach their country,\" said Griffiths, \"but I think anyone would want to stay at a club like Saracens, which is clearly in the middle of a huge and very exciting project.\" The latest episode of that venture was played out on Saturday in front of a world-record crowd for a club rugby match. For all their critics, Saracens undoubtedly have a remarkable flair for this kind of outrageous undertaking. Much comment has been passed about where they have come from, and so it should be, for the rise from humble beginnings to this would be laughed out of an editor's office, were it submitted as the plot for a book. This is the eighth game they have played at Wembley, and they have nearly doubled their previous best crowd here. \"I think we get better at it,\" said Griffiths. \"But the best marketing tool is word of mouth. The more people say they will come, the more they come. We've put on a great show \u2014 there's nothing like that pre-match show in English sport. In simple terms, father and son come for the rugby, but mum and daughter also come. There were 1,600 people in the rock choir, who brought 7,500 more with them. So more people came today because of the rock choir than normally watch us at Vicarage Road.\" And that's where the cynics continue to have their fun. Vicarage Road, despite a few promising crowds in the early years of professionalism, has never caught on. Saracens are on course to move from Watford to the new stadium they are planning at Copthall in the middle of next season. The vision is to fill Copthall, which will accommodate around 10,000, every time they play there and to attract the best part of a full house to Wembley two or three times a season. Continued success on the field will go a long way to helping. The only, albeit quite significant, downside to Saturday's extravaganza for Saracens was that they lost the match, but it was a well-timed humdinger of a game to showcase to so many people. Quins took the spoils with a three tries-to-one victory that sees them put six points between them and Saracens at the top of the table, with three games of the regular season left. They are now guaranteed a place in the play-offs. More than 160,000 have now seen these two play each other, with Quins filling Twickenham for the reverse fixture over Christmas. If they are to play one more time this season in front of another 80,000 crowd, it will be in the final \u2013 and, if this game was anything to go by, few would complain at that.
