Indra Setiawan is accused, along with a senior Garuda staff member, Rohainil Aini, of aiding the main suspect in the murder of Munir Thalib, who died after being poisoned with arsenic on an international flight. Mr Thalib, 38, a human rights lawyer who was an outspoken critic of the military's tactics in quelling dissent in East Timor, Aceh and Papua, died on board a Garuda flight bound for Amsterdam in 2004. A Garuda pilot, Polycarpus Priyanto, was convicted of the murder in 2005 and jailed for 14 years, but the sentence was quashed by the supreme court last year because of a lack of witnesses and evidence. Prosecutors, who are also fighting to overturn the supreme court decision, accuse Mr Setiawan of helping to assign Mr Priyanto, who was off duty at the time, to the Jakarta-Amsterdam service on which the lawyer died. During the original case Mr Setiawan told how he received a letter from Indonesia's intelligence agency asking him to name Mr Priyanto as flight security officer, an authorisation that Mr Aini signed. But Mr Setiawan later said he lost the letter, which was signed by the intelligence agency's deputy head. A state prosecutor, Noor Rachmad, accused Mr Setiawan of being an accessory to the \"intentional and premeditated murder\" after fresh evidence emerged that Mr Priyanto poisoned the activist while he was in transit at Singapore's Changi airport. Mr Thalib died a few hours before reaching Amsterdam. A postmortem by the Dutch authorities found he had ingested a large amount of arsenic. But Hari Wicaksono, a defence lawyer for Mr Setiawan - who faces up to 20 years' jail if convicted - questioned the prosecution's reliance on the assumption that Mr Priyanto was the murderer. \"The prosecution charges are unclear and should be dismissed,\" he said. \"The supreme court ruling makes them irrelevant.\" Mr Thalib's wife has toured the world meeting human rights activists and politicians, and won a promise from the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, that his killers would be punished."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
