More than 3,000 pupils in 48 state primary schools across England took part in a year-long trial as part of a study named \u201cphilosophy for children\u201d, and found that their maths and reading levels benefited by the equivalent of two months\u2019 worth of teaching. A Durham University evaluation said the results showed faster rates of progress for pupils eligible for free school meals, suggesting that the technique could \u201cbe used to reduce the attainment gap in terms of poverty in the short term\u201d. In the trial, key stage two classes of pupils aged between 8 and 11 were given regular classroom sessions featuring pupil-led discussions on topics such as fairness or bullying. Teachers received special training to act as moderators, while the children sat in a discussion circle. Stephen Gorard, professor of education at Durham and author of the evaluation, said: \u201cI think this study is interesting. All of the indicators are positive, even if they are small, and it\u2019s a relatively small cost.\u201d Gorard said he couldn\u2019t explain the success of the debates in improving an unrelated subject such as maths, but suggested that such open-ended discussions were unusual in primary classrooms, and meant children were more engaged and found school more enjoyable. \u201cThis is one particular approach and it\u2019s shown to have a positive effect on attainment, but we need to wait for replication [of the outcome] before drawing stronger conclusions,\u201d he said. Durham University has received funding from the Nuffield Foundation to conduct further research. Both teachers and pupils also reported improved classroom behaviour and relationships, as well as a boost to pupils\u2019 confidence in speaking, patience when listening to others, and self-esteem. Some teachers said the discussions had a positive impact on classroom engagement and may have resulted in some pupils asking more questions across all lessons. The philosophy for children movement originated in the US in the 1970s. The version used in the trial, funded by the Education Endowment Foundation, was supported by a British charity, the Society for the Advancement of Philosophical Enquiry and Reflection in Education (Sapere). \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to see such positive results for the students after only just over a year of philosophy for children \u2013 particularly for those facing disadvantage \u2013 and we anticipate that these benefits will continue to be built on in subsequent years,\u201d said Bob House, Sapere\u2019s chief executive. But Martin Robinson, a teacher and author who espouses an updated classical education based on grammar, dialectic and rhetoric, said that the use of philosophical discussion would be improved if schools adopted it in other subjects. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be about more than just the opportunity to speak,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cThese techniques should be part of how we approach teaching, and that would be much more powerful.\u201d Another piece of new research funded by the EEF found little positive effect from a project designed to improve the reading and literacy skills of children from low-income families. The study aimed to address the \u201cknowledge gap\u201d between disadvantaged and affluent children by building up their background knowledge and understanding, a cause espoused by the US academic ED Hirsch. However, the report found that \u201cteachers\u2019 subject knowledge did not appear to be sufficient to support a deep and engaging discussion of the material included in the curriculum\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
