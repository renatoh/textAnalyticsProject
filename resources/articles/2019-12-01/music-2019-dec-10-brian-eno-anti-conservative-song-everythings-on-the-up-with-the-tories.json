Everything\u2019s On the Up With the Tories is a jaunty number that sarcastically celebrates the Conservative government. One lyric rhymes Tories with \u201cthe gap between the rich and the poor-ies\u201d; another is a direct attack on the party\u2019s management of the NHS: \u201cThey\u2019re selling off the NHS to cowboys / they\u2019re cutting back on nurses but investing it in hearses / the nitwits and the we-don\u2019t-have-a-clue boys.\u201d The song fears for \u201ca few more years of Brexit purgatory\u201d and another line complains \u201cthere\u2019s people on the street without a bloody crust to eat\u201d. Proceeds from the song will go to homeless charities. Eno, celebrated for classic solo albums as well as his work with Roxy Music and production for Coldplay, U2 and more, is often outspoken on political issues. He supports a cultural boycott of Israel over their occupation of Palestinian territories, and is the president of the Stop the War Coalition. He has publicly supported Jeremy Corbyn as far back as 2015, celebrating \u201ca British politician speaking without a carefully pored-over PR briefing sheet, speaking with passion and confidence and courage from a set of deeply rooted beliefs and a great deal of personal experience\u201d. He recently co-signed two open letters backing Corbyn and Labour ahead of the general election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
