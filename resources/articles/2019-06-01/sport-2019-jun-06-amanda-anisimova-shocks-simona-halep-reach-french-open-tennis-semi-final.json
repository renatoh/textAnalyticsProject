That possibility describes a cycle of change that Williams had strangled with her brilliance in compiling 23 majors, a run that has stalled since the 37-year-old grande dame of tennis became a mother in September 2017. She has not won a tournament since and her game has an air of anxiety about it. Her premature departure here \u2013 a surprise more than a shock \u2013 at the hands of another young prodigy, 20-year-old Sofia Kenin, played a major part in reshaping the draw, which now pits Anisimova against the doughty and clever Australian Ashleigh Barty in one of the semi-finals on Friday and Vondrousova against Johanna Konta in the other. Their task will demand more resilience of them if the stormy weather is as bad as forecast but they are at least in the same lifeboat. All have played some brilliant tennis to get this far. On Thursday under clear skies, the American Anisimova stunned then outlasted the defending champion, Simona Halep, 6-2, 6-4, to become, at 17, the youngest semi-finalist here since Nicole Vaidisova 13 years ago. Barty was equally impressive, if not as obviously dominant, in beating the 14th seed, Madison Keys, 6-3, 7-5. She said: \u201cThat\u2019s probably close to my best match over the last month on clay \u2013 for all of one little blemish trying to serve out the match the first time. It was a really clean match. I felt like I was in control. I was able to put the balls in difficult positions for Maddie.\u201d The glowing testimonies for all the semi-finalists filled every microphone and rippled through every corridor. Pat Cash, a London resident but always an Australian, predicted, tongue in cheek, \u201can all-Australian final\u201d between Barty and Konta, who was born in Sydney and has called Eastbourne home since she was 14. Chris Evert, who won this title seven times and is now a sage voice on Eurosport, said: \u201cAsh Barty has got more variety than any of the players. She can disrupt anyone\u2019s rhythm. She will need that against Anisimova because she will hit you off the court. She showed power and composure and touch today. \u201cJo\u2019s had two days since her remarkable win over Sloane. Can she keep that momentum up? That is the question. I think she can, I think she will have hunger and inspiration, but she cannot get down on herself if she doesn\u2019t play up to that level.\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said women\u2019s tennis is unpredictable, since Serena hasn\u2019t been dominating the last two or three years. But Amanda played unbelievable today. I was stunned by Jo Konta on Tuesday. I was stunned again today by Amanda.\u201d Evert gave the impression that her compatriot - born in New Jersey and raised in Miami, the American daughter of Russian emigrants \u2013 was the one to watch. \u201cLook at this young lady, 17 years old, a star is being born right now. Her idol is Maria Sharapova. She plays like Maria Sharapova. Halep had windows of opportunity but just didn\u2019t take advantage of them on the big points.\u201d Anisimova does not lack for self-belief. A former girls finalist here in 2016, and a winner at Flushing Meadows in 2017, she told the New York Times two years ago, \u201cI definitely want to become No1 in the world and win every grand slam One of each would be like super awesome. I hope to do that one day.\u201d Konta was glad of an extra day off because of the rearranged timetable in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s washout. She has rarely looked as confident and relaxed before a big match. If she is to match the exact deeds of Sue Barker \u2013 the last British winner of the French Open, 43 years ago, as well as reaching semi-finals at Wimbledon and Melbourne, and the fourth round of the US Open \u2013 she will need all her composure against Vondrousova, a willowy 19-year-old with easy power on both wings and a keen tennis brain. But Konta is determined to stay in the zone she has occupied since her first match. \u201cI definitely accept my role as an entertainer,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople buy tickets to watch a show, to watch a match. I definitely do what I can from my side to make it entertaining, to bring my best performance. I always do that when I step out on court. That\u2019s my role as an entertainer. I am human as well, so that doesn\u2019t always happen \u2013 and that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
