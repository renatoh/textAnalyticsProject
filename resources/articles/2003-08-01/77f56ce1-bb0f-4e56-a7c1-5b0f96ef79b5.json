Woodward has not quite slammed the door on Catt, capped 56 times, or the talented Sale fly-half Hodgson but, with five weeks to go before unveiling his squad, the coach is indicating that his two midfield backs have only a \"slim chance\" of proving their fitness prior to the tournament. Neither Catt, beset by hamstring problems, nor Hodgson, who has not played since suffering serious knee damage against Italy last March, is among the 43-man squad preparing for England's upcoming warm-up Tests against Wales and France and, barring late injuries to others, they now appear doomed to disappointment. Catt's only remaining hope, according to the England management, is to impress when Bath currently training with the Royal Marines in Devon, play a warm-up game against the newly formed Celtic Warriors at Pontypridd on Sunday August 17. Hodgson, however, will definitely be sidelined for all three of England's warm-up Tests, starting in Cardiff on August 23. \"Going on the medical reports we've received I don't think he's going to play before September 8 which just about rules him out,\" said Woodward. That would appear to leave an alternative trio of fly-halves - Newcastle's Dave Walder, Wasps' Alex King and Northampton's Paul Grayson - battling to understudy Jonny Wilkinson. The rosier news for England is that the Leicester pair of Austin Healey and Lewis Moody, who also sat out the latter months of last season, are fit and raring to go. Healey was running with the rest of the squad yesterday in the roasting heat at Bagshot and Moody is scheduled to test his problematic shoulder in the London Pride Middlesex Sevens on Saturday week. There is no time to waste because Woodward is determined to take no passengers to Australia and insists as many as 14 or 15 places are still up for grabs. \"We want to make sure we take nobody unless they're absolutely at the peak of their form and fitness.\" England are awarding caps for the Cardiff game despite their intention to rest several senior players. It should also help ensure a sizeable crowd. At present 44,000 tickets have been sold for the 74,000 capacity Millennium Stadium, where England will be seeking to extend their unbeaten run to 14 games."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
