The home side were in complete control of the contest from early on, with the defender Nathan Ake and 18-year-old debutant Myron Boadu also among the goals, as they finished second in the standings with 19 points from eight games, two behind the group winners, Germany. Netherlands\u2019 coach, Ronald Koeman, said before the game he would experiment with team selection and stuck to his word, with the livewire Quincy Promes converted to right-back, and the AZ Alkmaar forward Calvin Stengs, 20, handed a debut from the start. It took the home side six minutes to hit the front, as Promes was afforded far too much space on the right and his delivery was headed back across goal and into the net by Wijnaldum, who scored eight times in his seven matches in the qualifiers. Netherlands dominated possession and launched wave after wave of attacks. They were rewarded for their endeavour with a second goal as Ake headed in a cross from Memphis Depay. The Netherlands got their third when Stengs robbed the ball off Karol Mets and set up Wijnaldum for his second. Captain for the night, Wijnaldum then collected a pass from Stengs to complete his hat-trick, before the AZ forward Boadu came off the bench to net the fifth. Christian Benteke and Kevin De Bruyne scored two goals each as Belgium thrashed Cyprus 6-1 in their Euro 2020 Group I qualifier at the King Baudouin Stadium. Belgium finish top of their pool with a perfect 10 wins from 10 games, scoring 40 goals in the process, as Yannick Carrasco and an own goal from Kypros Christoforou completed the rout of Cyprus. In the same group Russia thrashed San Marino 5-0. In Group E Slovakia beat Azerbaijan 2-0, while in Group G Latvia won their first European Championship qualifier since 2011, beating the Euro 2020 qualifiers Austria 1-0. In the same group North Macedonia beat Israel 1-0 and Poland squeezed past Slovenia 3-2."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
