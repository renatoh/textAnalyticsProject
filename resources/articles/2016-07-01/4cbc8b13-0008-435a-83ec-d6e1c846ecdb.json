The Rio de Janeiro judge Daniela Barbosa ruled that access to the application should be blocked immediately because WhatsApp\u2019s owner, Facebook, had shown \u201ctotal disrespect for Brazilian laws\u201d. Her decision said Facebook was repeatedly asked to intercept messages sent through the service to help in a criminal investigation in the city of Caxias, outside Rio. But hours later, her ruling was reversed by supreme court president Ricardo Lewandowski, who said that it seemed \u201cscarcely reasonable or proportional.\u201d In a post on Facebook, WhatsApp\u2019s CEO, Jan Koum, said: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking that less than two months after Brazilian people and lawmakers loudly rejected blocks of services like WhatsApp, history is repeating itself.\u201d In February, a judge from north-eastern state of Alagoas made a similar ruling in a separate investigation, but the order was overturned hours later. Whatsapp was also briefly blocked in December after an order by a judge in S\u00e3o Paulo. Hours later, a separate judge lifted the restrictions on that grounds that \u201cit does not seem reasonable that millions of users are affected\u201d because of the company\u2019s wrongdoing. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that people can access WhatsApp again in Brazil,\u201d a company spokesman said. \u201cThe Supreme Court swiftly rejected today\u2019s block, finding that it was disproportionate and violated people\u2019s fundamental freedom of expression. In his decision, the chief justice stressed how people from across Brazil, including members of the judiciary, rely on WhatsApp to communicate with others every day, and that they bear the greatest burden when a service is blocked. We hope that this puts an end to blocks that have punished millions of Brazilians and that people can continue using services like WhatsApp to stay in touch with those who matter to them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
