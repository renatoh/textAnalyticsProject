The Morocco international admitted that Spurs \"were not a good team\" and claimed the run of six defeats is the worst he has experienced in his career. Tottenham are on the brink of equalling the worst run of losses in the club's history if they lose at home to Middlesbrough on Sunday. Martin Jol, who replaced the previous coach Jacques Santini, has yet to win any of his three games since taking charge. Jol's latest setback, a 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa on Monday night, kept Spurs only two points off the Premiership relegation zone and, while the Dutchman remains positive about their performances, Naybet seems less enthusiastic. \"This is a moment of crisis but we have a new coach, new system, and new players,\" said the defender. \"We're not a good team. This is the first time I've lost six consecutive games. It is the worst run of my career and I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned about it but what can we do?\" Andy Hessenthaler has stepped down as the player-manager of the Championship strugglers Gillingham, who have made a miserable start to the season and currently lie second from bottom, four points adrift of safety. \"Andy Hessenthaler last night requested [that] he be released from his duties as team manager with immediate effect as he felt he had taken the team as far as he could,\" said the chairman Paul Scally. Hessenthaler, 39, who replaced Peter Taylor at the Priestfield Stadium in June 2000, is to stay with the club as a player. John Gorman has been put in temporary charge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
