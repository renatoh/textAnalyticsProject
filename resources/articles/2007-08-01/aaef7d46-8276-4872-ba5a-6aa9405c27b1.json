There were so many photos of dead people. But you were the one who spoke to me. I don't know why just some ... your photo is on the fridge and I go out into the garden and I cut flowers for you and I bring them into the kitchen and then I come in and I cry and cry and cry and cry and cry until I lie on the floor in the kitchen and I let out great screams of grief. I've written you a letter: \"I'm sorry you had to die. It is so wrong. It is so cruel. I saw you at breakfast on my television. I'm sure other people love you. I hope you have friends and family who love you and who are grieving but I just want you to know that I, a stranger who is not a stranger, loves you with all my heart and my life from now on is dedicated to my grief for you\". I wrote my letter and I didn't know what to do with it and now I put it in an envelope just marked \"TO THE DEAD\" and put it in the post. I wonder - (laughs) - I wonder where it went. And now we gather in the square. We all gather together in the square. And the band is playing. And the band is playing and candles are lit. And the band is playing and candles are lit and we all hold each other and we share our grief. And here's a prime minister and a pop star and a comedian and a businessman and the head of a media leviathan and they're all up on the stage and they are the same as us and we are all feeling the same pain. I'm so sorry. I don't know you. But will you hold me and share my grief? Of course I'll hold you. Of course I'll share your grief. Thank you. This feels right doesn't it? Isn't it right when there's so much pain that we all come together like this and hold each other and share each other's pain? Oh yes oh yes oh yes this is the right thing to do. The right thing to do. The right thing to do. Listen to the band and grieve. Music is listened to And now a message from our city, a message from our city to your city, a message. YOU HAVE BEEN BOMBED. WE ARE SICKENED. WE ARE GRIEVING. WE FEEL PAIN. YOU ARE FAR AWAY FROM US. BUT OUR HEART IS YOUR HEART. YOUR PAIN IS OUR PAIN. YOUR WORLD HAS CHANGED FOREVER. WE LOVE YOU. WE WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU BECAUSE WE ARE AS ONE WITH YOU FOREVER. Tonight I sleep for the first time since you were bombed. I am so much lighter. The children sleep. I take down their graveyard in the living room - the children don't object - and Thomas and I finally make love on the carpet. It is the best we have had for many years. He comes inside me. I love him. I tidy up the flat. Take down the pictures of the dead. Now seems the time. It somehow - I don't want to cling. I will always remember you but I won't cling. Can't see my mother's face. Ever since she died, I've seen her face but now I ... don't know somehow she's not there anymore. And I take out the photos and I look through the book and there she is on the bench in the Chinese garden with the fag in her hand. But close the book, close the book and her face goes again straight away. It won't stay. And now the days pass and I'm drinking coffee again. A new day. A new day and it's breakfast here, I am with a lovely strong - and the TV is on and you say: \"Why have they bombed us? We are the good people. That's what I just can't understand why would you bomb the good guys? We are good. We shop. We bring up our families. We keep order in our society. Our elected representatives make wise decisions. We enjoy ourselves. We have culture: folk bands, Monteverdi, jugglers. We have core values: freedom and democracy. The world yearns for our core values. And as quickly as geopolitics allows we are bringing the world our core values - freedom and democracy.\" And you are on the TV and you say to me: \"My brother was driving a bus this morning. A good man doing a good job. But now he is dead. He died on the street in front of the TV cameras. From my own kitchen, surrounded by my own family, I watched my own brother die. My grief runs very deep.\" \u00a9 Mark Ravenhill 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
