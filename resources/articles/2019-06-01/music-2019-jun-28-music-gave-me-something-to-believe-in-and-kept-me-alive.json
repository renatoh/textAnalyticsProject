I was trying to piece myself back together after a difficult couple of years. My mother had been transferred into care with advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease and my marriage had broken up. Something to Believe In was the song that did it \u2013 an almost-forgotten single from the Ramones\u2019 troubled mid-80s era. It was about losing your grip on yourself, on life, then rediscovering your sense of purpose. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be the same person but, then again, I didn\u2019t want to be. It was March 2018. I\u2019d written a few pieces that began to sketch out a story of a life on the margins of music but from the perspective of a fan, a wannabe, rather than a player. Over the next two months, a music memoir poured out: the first 30,000 words in three weeks. It was finished by Mother\u2019s Day. Something to Believe In was the obvious title, music being that something that had kept me sane, kept me going and, at times, kept me alive. What follows is a playlist of 10 songs \u2013 most sublime, at least one ridiculous \u2013 that signposted that journey. 1. The Ramones \u2013 Something to Believe In (1986) For whatever reason, the title track of Something to Believe In isn\u2019t on Spotify, so you\u2019ll have to go to YouTube for it. It\u2019s a Dee Dee Ramone song; he wrote most of the band\u2019s really dark stuff. This is one of his saddest but it\u2019s also uplifting. Joey\u2019s vocal will put a lump in your throat. In the first half, he wishes he was someone else. After Johnny\u2019s solo \u2013 one of very few solos by the guitarist \u2013 there\u2019s a bridge where he grabs life by the throat: he decides he\u2019s going to accept himself instead. 2. The Velvet Underground \u2013 Rock &amp; Roll (1970) In the liner notes for the Velvets\u2019 Live 1969 album, singer-songwriter Elliott Murphy wrote: \u201cThe difference between the movies and rock\u2019n\u2019roll is that rock\u2019n\u2019roll doesn\u2019t lie. It never promises a happy ending.\u201d I used those words as an epigraph. Murphy wrote them when rock was still young, the Velvets were still a cult, and he predicted that in 100 years kids would be writing school reports about the band as \u201cclassical rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d. It\u2019s a pretty far-sighted piece of early rock criticism. For anyone whose life was saved by rock\u2019n\u2019roll (or pop, or hip-hop, or whatever your thing is), this book doesn\u2019t promise a happy ending, but hopefully it offers a shot at redemption. 3. Iggy and the Stooges \u2013 Raw Power (original mix, 1973) To me, this is the greatest song about the power and the glory of rock\u2019n\u2019roll ever written. The chorus \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t you try, don\u2019t you try to tell me what to do\u201d \u2013 is what it\u2019s all about. So is this lyric: \u201cRaw power\u2019s got a healing hand / Raw power can destroy a man.\u201d Who knows how Iggy is one of the last true originals left standing but you only have to count the bodies to know he\u2019s right, and his next stop after recording this album was a psych ward. It\u2019s a classic now but, at the time, Raw Power was so far ahead of the curve no one even knew there was one up ahead. David Bowie\u2019s mix buried the rhythm section but it\u2019s still punk as almighty fuck. 4. Do Re Mi \u2013 Man Overboard (1985) This came out when I was 14 years old. At that time I knew nothing about women, let alone feminism, and I didn\u2019t really understand this song but connected with it anyway. I was a tiny kid and got bullied a fair bit in the playground, and I think I just related to Deborah Conway\u2019s rage and hurt more than anything. It\u2019s a post-punk song and a lot of punk spoke to people who had been marginalised in some way. These days I identify more with the object of Conway\u2019s disdain in ways I\u2019d rather not \u2013 I know I\u2019m addicted to attention and, as a music writer, I\u2019ve been wallowing in a swamp of trivia for most of my adult life. 5. Patti Smith \u2013 Free Money (1975) Lenny Kaye, guitarist for the Patti Smith group and compiler of the great 60s anthology Nuggets, once said garage music reminded people of why they wanted to rock\u2019n\u2019roll in the first place, which was pure desire. And we always want what we can\u2019t have. Another key concept of rock\u2019n\u2019roll is transcendence, the conceit that it can take us outside ourselves and so set us free. Smith embodied both in this song about escaping the prison of poverty. What really gets it over is the intensity of her performance. She sounds as though she\u2019s clawing out of your speakers. It starts slow, with just Smith and Richard Sohl on piano, then the band shifts through the gears until they\u2019re at maximum horsepower. 6. Kate Bush \u2013 The Big Sky (1985) This is similar to Free Money in that what makes it leap out is Bush\u2019s wild performance. Hounds of Love, the album that it\u2019s from, is really special to me; it seems to keep reappearing at key times. This song is about moving on \u2013 the idea is that we\u2019re all just specks in the cosmos. It\u2019s all big tribal drumming and stacked vocals, arranged for maximum impact. It gets louder the longer it goes as more elements are added to the mix but at the centre of it is Bush\u2019s voice. From about the three-minute mark she completely loses it \u2013 she sounds as though she\u2019s talking in tongues, then from 3.45 she unleashes a series of heart-stopping shrieks. She was possessed. 7. Liz Phair \u2013 Johnny Sunshine (1993) A lot of these songs are about the self-mythologising of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, something the Rolling Stones were pretty adept at. Liz Phair was in love with that ideal too \u2013 and the Stones \u2013 but understandably she had a problem with a lot of the lyrics. So she decided to write a song-by-song feminist response to the Stones\u2019 Exile on Main St. That was her first album, Exile in Guyville, and it upended all those old cliches. I write about Divorce Song in the book (because, well, divorce) but Johnny Sunshine is closer to the theme I\u2019m getting at here. It\u2019s Phair\u2019s response to All Down the Line, where the protagonist takes off with a \u201csanctified girl\u201d. In Johnny Sunshine, Phair replies from the perspective of the woman he\u2019s left behind. Living in an adolescent fantasy world usually means that someone, somewhere is getting hurt. 8. Jen Cloher \u2013 Hold My Hand (2013) My mother is in the final stage of Alzheimer\u2019s disease; she has been bedridden and unable to communicate for more than 18 months now. But the years before that were harder for her emotionally, and for her family and friends, as her illness stripped her identity from her, piece by incremental piece. She got it young, too, when she was in her mid-50s (she\u2019s 71 now). When Jen\u2019s song appeared, it reduced me to ash. Her mother had suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s too and the song describes a circular conversation between her parents: her dad explains to her mum how they met but she forgets instantly, so she asks him again. I had lots of conversations with my mum like that. The message of the song is that \u201clove is more than a reward or balm we use to soothe\u201d. It\u2019s an ongoing test of patience and loyalty. 9. Neil Finn \u2013 Chameleon Days (2017) In early September 2017 I was in Auckland for a music conference when I should have been in hospital. I was in a hotel room and had enough tablets on hand, plus booze, to kill a horse. I was in a really serious, unstable condition. But I had one thing left to do: I had to review Neil Finn\u2019s album. It sounds absurd but it was important to me to finish this one task. I listened to Chameleon Days about a dozen times in a row and it stayed my hand. It\u2019s a very gentle song about fate, change and radical acceptance. The next day I was up at Roundhead Studios where Neil had livestreamed cutting the song. 10. Kiss \u2013 God Gave Rock\u2019n\u2019roll to You II (1991) It\u2019s worth finishing with something big and dumb and silly, and they don\u2019t get bigger, dumber or sillier than Kiss. Originally this song was a hit for Argent in 1973. Kiss covered it in 1991, long after the face paint had come off. I love it, partly because it\u2019s so ridiculous, but also because it posits rock\u2019n\u2019roll as a primal life force in and of itself. Paul Stanley\u2019s rave at the end is so hilarious: \u201cI know life sometimes can get tough! And I know life sometimes can be a drag. But people! We have been given a gift. We have been given a road. And that road\u2019s name is \u2026 rock\u2019n\u2019roll!\u201d He was a true believer. \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636 \u2022 Andrew Stafford\u2019s Something to Believe In ($32.94, UQP) is out on 2 July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
