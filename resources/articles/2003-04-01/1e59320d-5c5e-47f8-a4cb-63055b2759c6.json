The Kurds appeared to have been promised their own state in the Treaty of S\u00e8vres after the First World War. But there was a catch. Buried in the small print was the requirement that the League must be convinced that they were 'capable' of independence. Our men at the FO implied that the Kurds were Kipling's 'White Man's Burden' - 'fluttered folk and wild/Your new-caught sullen peoples/Half devil and half child'. It was preposterous to think that they might be capable of governing themselves. 'Although they admittedly possess many sterling qualities, the Kurds of Iraq are entirely lacking in those characteristics of political cohesion which are essential to self-government. Their organisation and outlook are essentially tribal. They are without traditions of self-government or self-governing institutions. Their mode of life is primitive, and for the most part they are illiterate and untutored, resentful of authority and lacking in any sense of discipline or responsibility. [In these circumstances] it would be unkind to the Kurds themselves to do anything which would lend encouragement to the sterile idea of Kurdish independence.' Being cruel to be kind to Kurds has become a habit since. They are the largest people on earth without a state of their own. Spread across Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey - and oppressed in all four countries - their fate in the twentieth century was to be played with and persecuted. In the early 1970s, the Iraqi Baathist regime was getting too close to the Soviet Union for America's liking and threatening the Shah of Iran, a US client. Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon encouraged the Iraqi Kurds to revolt. Saddam Hussein responded to the pressure and came to terms with Washington. American, Israeli and Iranian advisers pulled out of Iraqi Kurdistan. Saddam sealed the borders and slaughtered. The standards of the Cold War were lax, but America's betrayal of an ally was still shocking. The Congressional select committee on intelligence said that 'the President, Dr Kissinger and the Shah hoped that [the Kurds] would not prevail. They preferred instead that the insurgents simply continue a level of hostilities sufficient to sap the resources of [Iraq]. The policy was not imparted to our clients, who were encouraged to continue to fight. Even in the context of covert operations, ours was a cynical exercise.' In 1988 Saddam killed somewhere around 100,000 Kurds in the 'Anzal' campaign to Arabise northern Iraq. The scale of the killing was such that no one knows the precise death toll, but for once, the overused word 'genocidal' was an accurate description of his policy. After the 1991 Gulf war, the Kurds along with the rest of Iraq took George Bush senior at his word and rose up when he called on the 'Iraqi military and the Iraqi people to take matters into their own hands'. They were massacred again. In 1996, they fought among themselves. Kurds being wiped out was a staple of international relations. The truth of the Kurdish proverb, 'we've no friends but the mountains', was indisputable. The change in the Iraqi Kurds' fortunes since 1996 has been remarkable. It's foolish to make predictions in such fluid times, but it does look as if history is at last being kind to the Kurds. Consider their position. Despite the enmity of Turkey, Saddam, Iran and Islamic fundamentalists, they managed to build a reasonably decent autonomous government in the no-fly zone of northern Iraq. At the start of the war, it looked as if the Turks would occupy their mini-state to stop its own Kurds getting the idea in their heads that they might govern themselves. But because Ankara refused to cut a deal with Washington, the threat has receded and American troops have become the Kurds' protectors. The clever Kurdish leadership has put its guerrillas under US control to emphasise that the Kurds at least are an ally America can rely on. Fear that they will be attacked with poison gas again is receding as the Iraqi regime weakens. Every day last week, there were small reports of the Kurds retaking villages which had been ethnically cleansed by Saddam. It's as if the Palestinians were to wake up and find that the world's only superpower was on their side and land they thought they had lost forever was back in their possession. The comparison isn't meant frivolously. What Baathism has created in northern Iraq is a West Bank, and even friends of the Kurds are worried about what will happen when the regime falls and the ethnically cleansed go home. It's hardto see the war as a 'war on Islam', and not only because Saddam has dedicated his career to killing Muslims. Baathism drew its inspiration from the worst of Europe: fascism and communism. Saddam's fondness for Stalin is well known, but he also has a thoroughly fascist obsession with racial purity. The city of Kirkuk, with its rich oil fields, has been 'Arabised' for decades. The purges increased after the last Gulf war and Kurds, Turks and Assyrians have become rarities in what was once their city. Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch interviewed the victims. Their stories could have come from Milosevic's Yugoslavia. There's the same pattern of demands for bribes, followed by threats, followed by expulsion, followed by the erasing of evidence that the impure ever existed. Asad Karim Salah, a Kurd, who was expelled from Kirkuk last year, described how it worked. First Baath party officials and secret policemen put pressure on him to abandon his identity and pretend to be an Arab. One of his two sons was instructed to spy on fellow students. When he refused he was thrown out of his university. Then the family was told that both boys must go into the army. One fled north to the Kurdish safe haven. The authorities who wanted him as a sol dier demanded that he return or else. When he didn't comply the family was stripped of its possessions and forced into exile. Human Rights Watch and the Kurdish authorities estimate that 120,000 people have been driven from the Kirkuk area since 1991. The government confiscated documents proving the ownership of property. As far as the paperwork is concerned they never lived in Kirkuk and have no rights. It seems a matter of basic justice to allow the exiles to return, but their houses have been taken by Arab families, some of whom have been in Kirkuk for two or three generations and know no other home. As the fighting neared Kirkuk last week, it appeared that the regime was as keen to use the threat of execution to keep Arab families in the city as to keep conscripts from deserting from the army. There were reports, which were impossible to confirm, of Arabs who had fled from the city being forced to go back. Kirkuk will fall soon, it may even have fallen by the time you read this, but there have been no preparations by the Americans and British to manage the aftermath. In March Iraqi opposition leaders and the Turks discussed setting up a commission to ensure the return of displaced people and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Ten days ago, Human Rights Watch warned that nothing had been done and Kirkuk was 'a disaster waiting to happen'. If 'a plan for the gradual and orderly return of these displaced civilians is not drawn up soon and implemented before the ground offensive begins, there is a real possibility that the city will erupt into inter-ethnic violence'. I spoke to Hania Mufti, the organisation's officer in Kurdistan, last week. She said the warning had had no effect whatsoever. The leaders of the Kurdish parties have tried to placate the Turks by promising that their forces won't annex Kirkuk and include it and its oil wells in the Kurdish zone. But, reasonably enough, they said there was little they could do to stop families going back to their houses and confronting the people who had 'stolen' their property. The 'untutored' Kurds are no different from anyone else. If you found someone else in your home, you would demand they left and become aggressive, possibly violent, if they refused because they had nowhere else to go. The Kurds may have got lucky for the first time since the First World War, but they're not out of the woods yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
