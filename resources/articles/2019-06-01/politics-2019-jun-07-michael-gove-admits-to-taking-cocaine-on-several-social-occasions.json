It was a mistake. I look back and I think, I wish I hadn\u2019t done that.\u201d The admission comes as Theresa May spends the final days of her premiership in Downing Street, with a number of the prime minister\u2019s Conservative colleagues vying to replace her. Gove, whom the bookmakers have as third in the race behind Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, insisted his past crimes should not be held against him in the leadership race. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that past mistakes disqualify you,\u201d Gove said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday, Gove\u2019s leadership rival Dominic Raab said he did not believe the admission would have an impact on Gove\u2019s chances in the leadership race. He said: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t see it barring him from this race in any way. I rather admire his honesty.\u201d Raab, who has previously admitted taking cannabis as a student, added: \u201cIt was a long time ago and pretty few and far between. I have never taken cocaine or any class-A drugs.\u201d He said class-A drugs were \u201ca bit different\u201d but added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to cast any further aspersions on Michael or anyone else who is just honest about being human and doing the things that some young people do \u2013 not everyone, obviously \u2013 and holding their hand up and saying: \u2018I got that wrong, move on.\u2019\u201d Later on the same programme, Craig Oliver, who was ex-prime minister David Cameron\u2019s chief spin doctor, suggested the admission could become an issue that overshadows Gove\u2019s leadership campaign messages. The Tory rank and file were socially conservative, Oliver said, and \u201cit\u2019s not the norm for them to see people taking cocaine at parties and that kind of thing\u201d. \u201cThe problem I think he\u2019s going to face is that it becomes a big issue that he\u2019s going to have to face,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cThe next television or radio interview, there\u2019s going to be a bit more probing on what other drugs have you taken, what were the circumstances? \u201cI\u2019m also not sure \u2013 although I do think that he\u2019s handling it right in terms of being as honest as possible about it \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that the line that \u2018I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to go into public life\u2019 is a great one. And \u2026 I would be advising him to change that and say: \u2018I was young and foolish I did a few foolish things, I regret that and I would like to move on.\u2019\u201d Asked about Gove\u2019s admission, Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cWell, he has decided to tell us what his past was like, that\u2019s his business.\u201d Asked if he believed mistakes in the past should disqualify potential leadership candidates, the Labour leader said: \u201cNo, I think people should tell us what they have done and move on in life. But I\u2019m unconcerned about Michael Gove\u2019s past life or behaviour to be quite honest.\u201d Asked whether he had taken drugs in the past, Corbyn said: \u201cNo, I\u2019ve led a very normal life in many ways.\u201d The Green party MP Caroline Lucas tweeted: \u201cRank hypocrisy of minister admitting to \u2018mistakes\u2019 on drug use while backing policies that perpetuate harm. From locking up disproportionate number of young, black men, to treating drug misuse as crime rather than health issue, prohibition fails us all.\u201d The environment secretary\u2019s declaration comes ahead of the publication of a book about him by the journalist Owen Bennett titled Michael Gove: A Man in a Hurry. According to the book, he admitted to having used cocaine to his advisers during the 2016 Tory leadership contest when they were putting him \u201cthrough his paces\u201d. An inside source reportedly said Gove replied: \u201cYes, cocaine,\u201d when he was asked if he had ever taken drugs. \u201cThe book is correct,\u201d the former justice secretary told the Daily Mail. \u201cI did take drugs. It is something I deeply regret. Drugs damage lives. They are dangerous and it was a mistake. \u201cObviously it will be for my colleagues in parliament and members of the Conservative party to decide now if I should be leader. I think all politicians have lives before politics. Certainly when I was working as a journalist I didn\u2019t imagine I would go into politics or public service. I didn\u2019t act with an eye to that.\u201d Gove joins a growing number of Conservative politicians to have discussed their various transgressions with drugs. Rory Stewart told the Telegraph last week that he had smoked opium in Iran at a wedding, but that his hosts, a poor family, had most likely put very little of the class A drug in the pipe and it had little effect upon him. The foreign secretary has also been asked whether he took drugs when he was younger. Hunt told the Times: \u201cI think I had a cannabis lassi when I went backpacking through India ... That is almost as naughty as wheat fields,\u201d he said, referring to May\u2019s confession when asked the naughtiest thing she ever did. In 2005, on Have I Got News For You, Johnson said: \u201cI think I was once given cocaine, but I sneezed and so it did not go up my nose. In fact, I may have been doing icing sugar.\u201d Years later, he confirmed that he snorted cocaine and smoked \u201cdope\u201d as a teenager. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2019. Rory Stewart told the Telegraph last week that he had smoke opium in Iran, not in Afghanistan as an earlier version said. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
