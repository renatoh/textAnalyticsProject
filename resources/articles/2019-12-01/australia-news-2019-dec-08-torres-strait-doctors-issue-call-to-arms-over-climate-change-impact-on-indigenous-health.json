In a joint statement, the doctors say they are concerned about the effects of heat stress and extreme weather events, the long-term effects of air pollution, the spread of disease, lost work capacity and reduced productivity, food insecurity, malnutrition, displacement and mental ill-health. \u201cClimate change will affect us all but our community in the Torres Strait will feel the first impacts,\u201d Dr Ineke Wever said. \u201cLow-lying islands, an international border, overcrowding and high rates of chronic disease, diabetes and asthma make this population particularly vulnerable to heat stress, air pollution, rising sea levels and the mental anguish [of] potential relocation from islands where people\u2019s families have lived for thousands of years.\u201d \u201cWe need to prepare our community to be as healthy as possible for the coming changes and reduce the amount of chronic disease we take with us into the future.\u201d Queensland\u2019s climate adaptation strategy in 2017 revealed a gap in policy, capacity and resources to respond to the health impacts of climate change. Little has been done since then, doctors say, but the Queensland report is still the only one to have been drafted by a state government as a standalone plan. An MJA-Lancet study published last month suggests Australia has a long way to go. \u201cOur research found no engagement on climate and health topics in the Australian federal government for the past 10 years,\u201d one of the authors, Dr Ying Zhang from the University of Sydney school of public health, said. \u201cThis is of significant concern, given the current impacts and projected escalation in frequency and severity of extreme weather events.\u201d The World Health Organisation has examined the health impacts of climate change in 13 Pacific Island countries. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Former senior medical officer in the Torres Strait Associate Prof Dr Lachlan McIver was the lead author of the WHO 2015 report and heads a health charity called Rocketship dedicated to improving health in the Pacific. \u201cI am horrified and disgusted at Australia\u2019s neglect in contributing to and managing the impacts of climate change,\u201d McIver said. \u201cMy concern is that there\u2019s a huge difference between the conversation that\u2019s happening in the conservative echo chamber in Australia and how seriously this is being taken across the Pacific region and elsewhere in the world.\u201d McIver said Pacific Island people don\u2019t have the luxury of being climate change sceptics. \u201cSolastalgia [is] a particular term that describes psychological trauma from loss of land, which is certainly applicable to the Torres Strait, which has many shared vulnerabilities with island communities elsewhere in the Pacific. \u201cOne of the most tragic aspects of the discussion of action around climate change on a global scale, regional scale or a local scale is that people are completely failing to understand that this is affecting people\u2019s health and lives now.\u201d McIver said in 2000 WHO estimated that climate change was causing in the order of about 150,000 excess deaths a year, based on a study of climate-sensitive diseases, malaria, diarrhoea, malnutrition and extreme weather events. \u201cBy 2030 that\u2019s expected to increase to around 250,000 per year,\u201d McIver said. \u201cThese are avoidable deaths caused by climate change. \u201cAs doctors that should motivate us; as community members it should motivate us. \u201cThis is not some abstract minority voice, this is a clear and present danger. According to the WHO authorities, it couldn\u2019t be clearer. \u201cIt\u2019s nightmarish and depressing. All is not lost, but we need action now.\u201d Dr Sam Jones, who has lived in the Torres Strait for 10 years, said the doctors hold deep worries for their children\u2019s future. \u201cWill there still be crayfish and turtles, dugong and sardines? These vibrant children of the Pacific, are they the canaries in the coalmine of climate change? \u201cTheir health, their culture, their future depends upon us taking positive action now, together.\u201d The group of doctors is calling for a greater investment in primary preventative healthcare, and \u201ca plan for rapid transition to a low carbon economy,\u201d they said. Torres Strait Island regional councillor Ted Nai, who also sits on the Torres and Cape Hospital and Health Service Board, agreed that \u201ccourageous, visionary leadership that is of a higher order than the mere party line and politics\u201d is needed. \u201cWe must act with moral leadership and create optimism and hope,\u201d Nai said. \u201cWe islander people, including the people of the Pacific, who are the most at risk of these climate change impacts, must ask how do we ride the crest of the wave of this global conversation, and showcase how to build resilient and thriving communities that can live sustainably into the future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
