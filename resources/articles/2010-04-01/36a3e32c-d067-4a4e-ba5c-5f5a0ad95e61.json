The Welsh region interpreted a signal for advantage near the Biarritz 10-metre line 11 seconds from the end as an imminent penalty award. But Dimitri Yachvili's knock-on had not been deemed deliberate and when Dan Biggar's 40-metre drop-goal attempt drifted wide, there was no time for the scrum to be set. The Ospreys' captain, Ryan Jones, said Clancy told him there was no time for the penalty to be taken, but Yachvili said he heard the official use the word \"scrum\". Clancy would not comment afterwards but the issue was not so much what he may have said as whether Yachvili's action, when he palmed Mike Phillips's pass with his left hand, making no attempt to catch the ball, merited a penalty. \"I was worried that the referee would award a penalty,\" Yachvili said. \"There had been a similar incident in the first half when he gave a scrum so I hoped I would not be punished. I heard him say it was a knock-on and he told the Ospreys that if he awarded the scrum the game would be over.\" The Biarritz coach, Jean-Michel Gonzalez, said he thought the Ospreys should have been awarded a penalty, calling Clancy's decision peculiar. But the Ospreys were in an attacking position because the referee had harshly penalised the home side, who had been trying to run down the clock by picking and going out of penalty goal range. After coming a distinct second to Saracens and Munster in their previous two semi-finals, the The Ospreys dominated for long periods and cut the Biarritz defence out wide at will. They scored three tries to two and blew four clear opportunities. Just as costly as their profligacy was a facility for making mistakes. They have a bizarre tendency to make the intricate appear routine and the simple complicated. Biarritz's two tries came directly from Ospreys errors, first when the visitors were shoved off their own attacking scrum. That set up the US wing Takudzwa Ngwenya to sprint 80 yards to score. Ten minutes into the second half, Biggar's restart failed to go 10 metres and Ngwenya broke away from another scrum to chip ahead, for Iain Balshaw to beat Andrew Bishop to the bounce and score the French side's second try. Yachvili's two penalties were soft. Ryan Jones had just scored his team's first try when he was penalised for holding on in a ruck from the restart. Biggar tackled Ngwenya without the ball after a pass intended for the wing had missed its target by five metres. Factor in two of Damien Traille's three drop goals coming after the Ospreys had lost their own lineouts and the real reason the Welsh region lost had far more to do with themselves than Clancy. Bishop twice took the wrong option with the line beckoning and Lee Byrne kicked ahead on the Biarritz 22 when he had Hook and Shane Williams free outside him with only Ngwenya in defence. Biggar threw a pass behind Bishop 15 metres out and Tommy Bowe twice made telling breaks only to fail to find his support runners. \"We have to start believing, recognising that we are a bloody good team,\" the Ospreys' head coach, Sean Holley, said. \"We are not a side of individuals and this defeat is devastating. We played the better rugby but we were not clinical enough. I felt we should have had a penalty at the end, but we had the chances to nail the game before that.\"While the Ospreys were the more threatening side with the ball in hand, running out of their own 22 in the opening minutes, their set-pieces were weak \u2013 they lost six of their lineout throws \u2013 and they lacked a calming influence. Biarritz, in contrast, had Traille who recognised the value of turning position into points, his three drop goals a case of Traille, Traille and Traille again. The centre's first drop came after 30 seconds and he transcended the mediocrity of most of his team-mates. While both semi-finals will be hosted by French clubs, Munster will have few inhibitions about travelling to San Sebastian. \"The Ospreys were powerful and efficient, played more open rugby than us and were much fitter in the first half,\" Yachvili said, \"but to win games you need a good scrum and lineout.\" Munster certainly have the latter and, unlike the Ospreys, they have the composure that makes the difference in close encounters and the ability to do the simple effectively.
