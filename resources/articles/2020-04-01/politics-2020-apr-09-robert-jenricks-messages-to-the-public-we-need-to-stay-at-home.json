But on Thursday the Guardian revealed that Robert Jenrick has visited his own parents, who live 40 miles from his home. The housing and communities minister has delivered a consistent message in his public statements in recent weeks: Sky News, 22 March: The advice today is very clear: we need to stay at home all bar the most essential activities, and by doing that we\u2019ll protect the NHS and help to save lives. I know it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day and I know it\u2019s tough and it goes against everything that we want to do as a family, but don\u2019t go and see your mum. Give her a phone call, Skype her, FaceTime her, tell her that you love her and that we\u2019re going to get through this together. Mail on Sunday comment piece, 22 March: We are facing a huge challenge on a scale not seen since the second world war. It\u2019s not just a national emergency, it\u2019s a global emergency \u2013 one which puts some of us at more risk than others. The choices that we must make over the coming days and weeks can save many lives. That means families making big sacrifices \u2013 especially today, on Mother\u2019s Day. It\u2019s so important that we speak to our loved ones as much as we can \u2013 whether that\u2019s FaceTime or a phone call. But for now, we must practise social distancing in order to tackle the spread of the virus. We need to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. But while we create physical distance between ourselves, we must at the same time have closer social support for our neighbours. Downing Street press conference, 29 March: We each have a part to play by staying at home, protecting the NHS and helping to save lives. We all have a duty to one another to keep everyone safe. Twitter, 3 April: If you are considering going out this weekend, please don\u2019t, unless it\u2019s for work (where you cannot work from home), health reasons, food shopping or exercise. We need to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
