Royal Dutch Shell and BP will both face investors this week with quarterly financial results that will deliver profits well below those achieved a year ago, against a backdrop of tumbling share prices and rising Covid infections across major economies. On Tuesday, BP is expected to report an underlying loss of $120m for the last quarter, according to analysts\u2019 estimates. This would be a major improvement on its underlying loss of $6.7bn in the second quarter, following heavy writedowns on the company\u2019s exploration business, but would still be well below the $2.3bn third-quarter profit reported in 2019. BP\u2019s announcement will come days after its share price fell below 200p a share for the first time since 1994, and months after the company cut its dividend for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and set out plans to cut 10,000 jobs. In the same week, Shell is expected to reveal a modest underlying profit, of $146m, for the third quarter, according to analysts, after plunging to a loss of $18.4bn for the second quarter. This is still a fraction of the $4.76bn profit recorded in the same quarter last year, and follows the company\u2019s decision to cut 9,000 jobs and reduce the dividend for the first time since the second world war. This trend is expected to be followed across the world\u2019s oil companies, tracking the fragile and uncertain recovery of global oil markets amid a second wave of coronavirus infections. The price of oil reached an average of $43 a barrel in the third quarter \u2013 stronger than the average of $30 a barrel in the second quarter, when US oil prices fell below zero for the first time in April \u2013 but still well below the $62 a barrel price that prevailed in the third quarter a year ago. Oil industry investors may have already weathered the darkest days of the pandemic, but in recent months it seems to have dawned on many that there is a very long road ahead \u2013 and that a full oil industry recovery may never happen. Many experts believe that the heavy hit to demand for oil during the pandemic may mean it is years before market prices recover to $50 a barrel. BP\u2019s own global energy forecasts suggest that oil demand may never recover from the impact of coronavirus on the global transport industry, heralding a sooner-than-expected existential decline for fossil fuels. The company\u2019s energy outlook report seemed to underline the importance of BP\u2019s plans to reduce production of oil and gas by 40% over the next decade while investing billions in renewable energy to transform it from oil major to modern energy company. But in investors\u2019 eyes the oil industry\u2019s battered balance sheets don\u2019t look in good shape for fuelling a green energy transition. BP\u2019s shares have languished at 25- year lows for the past month, taking its \u00a341bn market cap to less than a third of what it was a decade ago, following its failed bid to move \u201cbeyond petroleum\u201d in the early 2000s. The company\u2019s market value has been topped by offshore wind developer \u00d8rsted, once known as Danish state oil company Dong Energy, which has a market valuation of \u00a349.6bn on the Copenhagen exchange. Its valuation has doubled in the past two years after it switched from fossil fuel investments to renewable energy a decade ago. \u00d8rsted is a stark reminder of what might have been possible for other oil companies had they seized the opportunity to invest in the nascent renewables industry, and may prove a formidable rival for the favour of investors, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
