The candidates, speaking on Wednesday at the annual convention of the NAACP, the nation\u2019s largest and oldest civil rights organization, said Mueller\u2019s testimony highlighted the urgency for bringing articles of impeachment against a president whose bigotry while in office has harmed communities of color. \u201cThis is a moment in history and every single member of Congress should be called on to vote and to live with that vote for the rest of their lives,\u201d said Warren, who was the first presidential candidate to push for impeachment \u2013 a point of distinction that she emphasized. \u201cI read the Mueller report the day it came out,\u201d she told the NAACP delegates who unanimously voted on Tuesday to recommend the House launch impeachment proceedings against Trump. \u201cWhen I got to the end, I did not stick my finger in the air and ask about the politics, I did not hesitate. This is a man who has broken the law and he should be impeached.\u201d Bernie Sanders said: \u201cHe is not exonerated. He called Trump a \u201cracist\u201d who is \u201ctrying to divide the American people up based on the color of their skin.\u201d Sanders, who has called on the House to begin an impeachment inquiry, said it is a matter of fact \u201cthat the president did everything that he could to obstruct the Mueller investigation\u201d. As the candidates spoke in Detroit, Mueller testified before to House panels on Capitol Hill about his 448-report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. In his testimony, Mueller dismissed Trump\u2019s claims of total exoneration and stated explicitly that his conclusions did not clear the president of obstruction of justice. The hours of televised testimony produced few revelations beyond what was included in Mueller\u2019s report, which was delivered to the justice department in March. Muellerl\u2019s investigation \u201cdid not establish\u201d that Trump\u2019s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election but it declined to make a determination as to whether Trump obstructed justice. Impeachment proceedings must begin in the House, where the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has resisted growing support for impeachment among her Democratic caucus, saying repeatedly that it would play into Trump\u2019s hands politically before the 2020 election. Last week, the House stopped an effort to launch impeachment proceedings, but 95 Democrats voted in support of moving forward with the resolution. Joe Biden said at a campaign stop in Dearborn, Michigan: \u201cI think there are impeachable offenses and that the president should be tried for them. I think it\u2019s something that the House has to come about in an orderly way so that the American people understand that this is not done for political reasons.\u201d Asked if a Biden administration would pursue charges against Trump after he leaves office, as candidates such as the California senator Kamala Harris have suggested, Biden said it was \u201cpremature.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not one of these guys \u2013 you know, lock him up or send her home or that kind of stuff,\u201d he said. Harris, who supports impeachment, accused the attorney general, William Barr, of \u201cmisleading the American people\u201d about Mueller\u2019s findings and said Mueller\u2019s public testimony would help set the record straight. She said: \u201cThe American people are smart enough to know what is and what is not truth.\u201d New Jersey senator Cory Booker agreed that the House should begin impeachment proceedings, saying Mueller\u2019s report described behavior of \u201cdeceit\u201d and \u201cinstructing people to lie\u201d. Yet he urged Democrats to focus their energy on removing Trump from office \u201cat the ballot box\u201d as an inquiry would almost certainly result in an acquittal by the Republican-led Senate. South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg said an impeachment inquiry would \u201cbring more facts to light\u201d but he too cautioned that the proceedings would probably stall in the Senate. He said: \u201cI\u2019m focusing on the best thing I can do about the Trump presidency, which is to defeat it in November of 2020.\u201d Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar said: \u201cIn America \u2026 the law is king. The king is not the law. It is time for Donald Trump to stop the racism [and] to leave the White House.\u201d The former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who was not asked about impeachment at the conference, said in a statement that Mueller\u2019s testimony adds \u201curgency\u201d to calls for impeachment. He said: \u201cThere must be consequences, accountability and justice. And the only way to ensure this is for Congress to begin impeachment proceedings.\u201d On Tuesday, the Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, one of the four freshman lawmakers of color Trump said should \u201cgo back to the countries they came from\u201d, received a standing ovation as she took the stage to address the NAACP conference gathered in the city where she was born \u2013 and now represents in Congress. She said: \u201cY\u2019all, I\u2019m not going nowhere. Not until I impeach this president.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
