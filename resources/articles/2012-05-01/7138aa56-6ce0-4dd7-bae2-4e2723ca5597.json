Because he's one of the few radio DJs who never stopped listening to demos, or buying albums. Because when the people putting his record collection online (a process that began yesterday) get to the letter F, the number of Fall rarities will be mind-boggling. Because of the regularity with which he wouldplayrecordsatthewrongspeed before correcting the mistake. Because he took the trouble to count up the votes for his Festive 50. Because he was one of the few radio personalities who would tell off his listeners for voting too conservatively. Because of the encouragement he gave the Smiths \u2013 and some really terrible bands too. Because of the way he would follow up Nigerian highlife with Norwegian death metal that sounded like a cement mixer vomiting its innards. Peelie, wherever you are, we salute you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
