Evidence that FBI agents failed to disclose that they had fired shots at Finicum and queries about whether critical evidence was removed comes from the local Deschutes County sheriff\u2019s office investigation, lending credence to claims previously dismissed as conspiracy theories. Finicum, a 54-year-old Arizona rancher and one of the leaders of the rightwing militia that occupied an Oregon wildlife refuge, was shot and killed by state troopers on a remote highway on 26 January. The confrontation also resulted in the arrests of key protesters and marked the beginning of the end of the 41-day standoff. Further bolstering theories of evidence removal, law enforcement sources told the Oregonian this week that they had seen an FBI video that showed an agent appear to bend over twice and pick up something near where the two shots likely occurred. The sheriff\u2019s office, responsible for investigating the shooting, recently determined the shooting was justified and released close-up footage of the final moments before Finicum exited his vehicle and was killed. From the start of the investigation, Finicum\u2019s supporters across the west have hailed him as a martyr for the conservative land-use rights movement, arguing that the FBI planned and executed a coordinated assassination of a non-threatening activist, and then worked to cover its tracks by making it look like the shooting was a case of self defense. While many brushed aside the claims of Finicum\u2019s backers as fringe conspiracy theories, hundreds of pages of documents newly released by the Deschutes sheriff investigation have raised significant concerns about the FBI\u2019s actions during and after the shooting. \u201cWe are seeing a massive cover-up,\u201d said Jeanette Finicum, Lavoy\u2019s widow. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lack of integrity and honesty from the very beginning \u2026 They can\u2019t be trusted to investigate each other.\u201d Sheriff Shane Nelson of Deschutes County, who led the investigation into the shooting in nearby Harney County, revealed last week that Oregon state troopers fired six shots and that the FBI on scene fired two shots \u201cas Mr Finicum exited the truck\u201d. But, Nelson told reporters, after the incident, FBI operators \u201cdid not disclose their shots to our investigators nor did they disclose specific actions they took after the shooting\u201d \u2013 a \u201cfailure\u201d now under investigation by the US inspector general. New police documents reveal that the sheriff\u2019s office also repeatedly asked state troopers whether they saw bullet casings on the ground and if they witnessed anyone removing them \u2013 raising questions about whether the FBI may have actively eliminated evidence that would prove they fired shots. After inquiring about the casings, an investigator interviewing an individual identified as \u201cOfficer 5\u201d, asked: \u201cDid you happen to see anybody, um, picking anything up? Like, specifically the rifle brass or anything else from the scene?\u201d The officer did at one point, however, see at least two rifle casings by the FBI trucks, according to the interview transcript. Detectives collecting evidence never found the casings, according to the police reports. \u201cThey\u2019ve been caught lying several times,\u201d said Angie Bundy, wife of Ryan Bundy, one of the militiamen in the car with Finicum who is now behind bars and facing charges of conspiring against the government. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a fair trial if they\u2019re just going to lie \u2026 And this goes way beyond lies. They murdered somebody and they tried to murder more innocent people, my husband being one of them.\u201d Mike Arnold, lawyer of Ammon Bundy, another jailed militia leader and Ryan\u2019s brother, said the latest disclosures have forced him to rethink his initial dismissal of various cover-up allegations raised by Finicum supporters. \u201cI\u2019m definitely no longer discounting any theories put forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want the truth.\u201d Utah state representative Michael Noel, a close friend of Fincium\u2019s relatives, added, \u201cI want to see a full investigation of those agents \u2026 Personally, I thought it was an unjustified homicide.\u201d The revelation that officers fired shots while Finicum was leaving his car also sheds light on the FBI\u2019s intentions, said Jeanette. \u201cIt was an ambush \u2026 They were looking for a particular outcome, and I think that they got it.\u201d Last week, FBI special agent Greg Bretzing said officials have not resolved the question of who fired the additional shots, and said the agency was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the inspector general investigation. \u201cI can assure you that no one \u2026 wanted this situation to end in violence or death,\u201d he added. Asked about the new reports of alleged misconduct and a possible cover-up, Bretzing said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cTo preserve the integrity of that investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
