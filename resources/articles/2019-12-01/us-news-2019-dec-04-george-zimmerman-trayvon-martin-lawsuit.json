Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin, 17, following a nighttime altercation between the two at his gated community in Sanford in February 2012. He was acquitted of second-degree murder in a closely watched trial that triggered a national debate over racial injustice, civil rights and gun violence. In a 36-page lawsuit circulated by his lawyers, Zimmerman claims his reputation was destroyed by the \u201cmalicious prosecution\u201d and alleges that the state\u2019s attorney, Angela Corey, and her team of prosecutors relied on a witness who falsely claimed to be Martin\u2019s girlfriend to testify against him. He further alleges that Benjamin Crump, the civil rights attorney who has represented Martin\u2019s parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, since their son\u2019s death, defames him in Crump\u2019s recent book Open Season: Legalized Genocide of Colored People. Evidence presented during Zimmerman\u2019s trial included a recording of a call to the Sanford police department in which Zimmerman, now 36, said he was following Trayvon, who was on his way back to his father\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s house with Skittles and a soft drink he had just bought at a nearby gas station. \u201cOK, we don\u2019t need you to do that,\u201d a dispatcher told Zimmerman. According to the lawsuit filed by the Boca Raton-based attorney Larry Klayman, founder of the conservative legal activist group Judicial Watch, his client now lives in constant fear of attack and \u201coften receives death threats when he appears in public\u201d. It adds that he suffers from \u201cdepression and PTSD\u201d. The allegations about a fake witness center on a teenager called Rachel Jeantel, whom the lawsuit claims gave testimony as Martin\u2019s girlfriend as \u201can imposter\u201d for her half-sister Brittany Diamond Eugene, Martin\u2019s \u201creal\u201d girlfriend at the time. Jeantel told jurors she was on the phone with Martin, who claimed he was being pursued by a \u201ccreepy-ass cracker\u201d as he walked home. The testimony about Zimmerman, who is of Hispanic heritage, added further controversy to an already racially charged trial. The lawsuit claims the \u201cconspiracy\u201d to have Jeantel testify in her sister\u2019s place was hatched when prosecutors could not persuade Eugene to make a statement incriminating Zimmerman. Crump, who owns a law firm in Tallahassee, rejected Zimmerman\u2019s claims. \u201cI have every confidence that this unfounded and reckless lawsuit will be revealed for what it is, another failed attempt to defend the indefensible and a shameless attempt to profit off the lives and grief of others,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis plaintiff continues to display a callous disregard for everyone but himself. He would have us believe that he is the victim of a deep conspiracy despite the complete lack of any credible evidence to support his outlandish claims.\u201d A representative for Fulton, who is running for a seat on the Miami-Dade county commission next year, did not immediately return a request for comment, and attempts to reach the Trayvon Martin Foundation, the anti-gun advocacy group set up by Fulton and Martin, were also unsuccessful. Zimmerman, meanwhile, has been immersed in several controversies since his acquittal. In 2016 he attempted to profit by selling the gun he used to kill Trayvon, branding the weapon an \u201cAmerican firearm icon\u201d and promising the proceeds would help fight the activities of Black Lives Matter. One year earlier, a violent road rage incident resulted in a Florida man, Matthew Apperson, being sentenced to 20 years in prison for attempted murder after shooting at Zimmerman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
