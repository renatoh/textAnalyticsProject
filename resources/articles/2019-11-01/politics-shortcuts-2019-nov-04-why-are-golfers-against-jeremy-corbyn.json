Age: A few days old. Appearance: Rich, angry, inexplicably fond of horrible trousers. We all knew this day would come. Finally, the golfing community has spoken as one about Labour\u2019s nebulous Brexit policy. Nope, try again. OK. Finally, the golfing community has spoken out against the pointlessness of trying to elect a historically disliked party leader. Wrong again. Shall I just put you out of your misery? I honestly can\u2019t think of any others issues that are more pressing in the modern day than either of \u2026 It\u2019s taxes. What? Golfers hate Jeremy Corbyn because he wants them to pay more taxes. Really? Golfers specifically? No, not just golfers, but given that golfers are essentially just big babies who pay to visit giant adult playgrounds where they can hit balls and drive around in special little cars, they are probably quite a good microcosm of the idle rich. Good point. So who said what? Well, the golfing community seems to have taken offence at Corbyn\u2019s claim that \u201cin a fair society there would be no billionaires and no one would live in poverty\u201d. Anyone specifically? Ian Poulter, the 40th best golfer in the world, tweeted the following to Corbyn: \u201cWhat a complete buffoon you really are. No one is allowed to be successful. You can\u2019t for one minute be serious. Deluded.\u201d Anyone else? Lee Westwood, the 68th best golfer in the world, also tweeted: \u201cThis tweet is not aging well Jezza. If you\u2019ve bothered to read the responses I\u2019d consider rethinking your policies.\u201d Big poverty fans, then, those two? Not quite. It\u2019s more that they think Corbyn\u2019s plan is a punishment against the successful. Are they billionaires? God, no. Not by a long shot. Poulter\u2019s wealth is thought to be about \u00a346m, while Westwood is only worth a measly \u00a330m. If they wanted to become billionaires, they would have respectively had to do 21 and 34 times better in their career than they actually did. So what\u2019s the problem? Don\u2019t you see? Corbyn wants to rob them of their aspiration. They could still become billionaires. It wouldn\u2019t take much. Maybe a good investment opportunity. Maybe they could invent the next Amazon. Maybe another billionaire could suddenly die and leave their entire national net worth to those two golfers. It could happen! Could it? No, of course not. Poulter and Westwood are a pair of dummies. I guess this means Poulter will leave the country if Labour wins the election. He\u2019s way ahead of you. He moved to Florida years ago. So what\u2019s all the fuss? You tell me, kid. You tell me. Do say: \u201cJeremy Corbyn wants to ban success.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cWait a minute, are golfers Tories?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
