Dzeko managed only one league goal in 14 appearances after signing from Wolfsburg in January. The Bosnia international scored four times in six cup games but became a peripheral figure and, at times, looked out of touch and low on confidence. \"I was new to the team and it was a hard season,\" Dzeko said from the team's pre-season base in Los Angeles. \"It's always difficult to come to a new club midway through a hard season like that, and maybe when I arrived I was sick of all the talk about the transfer. It got to my head a little bit. But I still think I had some good games and scored some important goals. \"I've had a pre-season with the team now, which I think is the most important thing for every player, and I think I'm working hard and so we'll see what happens in the season. I know this season will be much better. Every player needs time to settle in and to get used to a new club, from knowing the league, to the other players \u2013 everything.\" Dzeko was an unused substitute in the FA Cup final and faces a battle to get a sustained run in the team, given that it increasingly looks like Sergio Ag\u00fcero will be joining the club and with the possibility Carlos Tevez may have to stick around for a little longer yet. Dzeko's hope is that the team will start playing more to his strengths, specifically with orthodox wingers who get to the byline and deliver crosses. \"Every striker is stronger when we play with wingers,\" he says. That way, Dzeko believes he can make the most of his aerial ability to demonstrate why he was such a prolific striker in the Bundesliga. \"Manchester City didn't pay all that money for me because they saw me once on YouTube. They saw me scoring good goals. And I haven't forgotten how to score goals. I will show that next season.\" He is also encouraged by his feedback from the manager, Roberto Mancini. \"He's telling me all the time: 'I believe in you and continue to work hard', and that's what I'm doing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
