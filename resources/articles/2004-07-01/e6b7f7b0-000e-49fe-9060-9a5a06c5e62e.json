In defence of academies, he makes the extravagant claim that \"when I was the MP for Sparkbrook I would have given half of my majority to have something elite built within the constituency's boundaries\". This reminds me of Archbishop Blanche school in Liverpool, cited in the early 1990s by Tory education secretary John Patten. He heaped praise on the miraculous results achieved by a school \"in the heart of inner-city Toxteth\". He forgot to mention that the school selected its pupils from all over Merseyside and only a small percentage lived in Toxteth. Academies - some children will find a seat in the lifeboat, but Roy Hattersley needs to answer the question of what will happen to the other schools in the neighbourhood? Take away their brightest pupils, allow the best teachers to migrate to the higher-paying academies and they will become the new cash-strapped secondary moderns. Roy seems to have learnt nothing and forgotten everything. Richard Knights, Liverpool \u00b7 As a member of the Secondary Headteachers Association, I find it dispiriting that John Dunford, the general secretary, says the government's five-year plan for education \"contains most of what we hoped to see and very little to which we would take exception\". Many of us in state education bitterly resent and oppose what the government is proposing. Essentially the government is suggesting the present system is failing. Whilst there may well be genuine problems in some urban areas, all over the country there are thousands of highly successful, thriving schools. Parental surveys show highlevels of satisfaction; exam results and standards are rising; and the quality of teaching has never been better. The government has happily seen its plans portrayed as the end of the \"bog standard\" comprehensive, yet the majority of these schools have adapted and developed to such an extent that I remain more proud than ever to be a comprehensive school headteacher. The small fortune spent on city academies will direct resources from other schools. Even if they prove successful, something that is by no means certain, they tend to attract and choose students who may vary in ability but have the most parental support and positive attitudes to study, leaving other schools with the possibility of a vicious circle of decline. The sensible way ahead has always been encouragement to the vast majority of schools that are doing well, and extra support for those that face special problems. To some extent this policy is working, so why the need for expensive and almost certainly futile change - and why are organisations like SHA accepting it? Tony Stephens, the Thomas Adams school, Wem, Shropshire Opportunity knocks Campaigning for Mainstream Universities (CMU) welcomes the recognition of the work of mainstream universities in widening participation from ethnic minority groups (Mixed messages, Higher, July 13). However, it is disappointing that the mantra that students will miss out on \"the best opportunities\" if they do not get into the so-called \"traditional\" universities is repeated. It is for the latter to explain why they have remained white-dominated. Some of the most exciting job opportunities are promoted by mainstream universities. We need to do more to support the transition into the jobs market; but recruitment practices for the so-called \"best\" jobs, which perpetuate discrimination against gradu ates from mainstream universities and which add to the discrimination faced by ethnic minority students, need to be subject to review. Government departments as well as private sector employers, please take note. Pam Tatlow, chief executive, CMU Sunken battleships? Your diarist (FE diary, Further, July 13) refers to Gordon Brown telling a story about the effect on budgetary practices of pressure to fund \"six new Dreadnought submarines\" in 1906. Although there may have been a Dreadnought submarinein the 1980s, I doubt the Treasury was budgeting so far ahead. Somebody presumably meant to refer to \"Dreadnought battleships\" but was it your diarist or Gordon Brown who slipped on the slipway when launching this story? John Hall, Stoke Bishop, Bristol Research value for money The proposed change in funding is perhaps another nail in the coffin for the many underfunded, and in some cases non-funded, researchers in the UK (Show me the money, Higher, July 13). Money is likely to become ever more concentrated among a smaller number of researchers. For many years I have argued that panels should consider some kind of \"value for money\" criterion in their allocation of funding. Small amounts of money can be put to very good use by units ranked 3A. Additionally, some types of research require smaller resources to survive, prosper and maintain morale. My guess is that most 3A units would score considerably better on value for money than many higher ranking units.
