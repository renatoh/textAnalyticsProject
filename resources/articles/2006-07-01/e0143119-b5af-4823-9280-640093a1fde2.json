The pavilion was added in 1878 for Worcestershire county cricket club before they moved to New Road in 1896. It was declared unsafe last year and faces demolition as part of redevelopment of a factory site. Adam Wilkinson, secretary of conservation group Save, said yesterday: \"This handsome cricket pavilion must not go. It is very much a part of Worcestershire's and the nation's proud cricketing heritage.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
