This must be a forest school. Or is it? According to academics in a book, Critical Issues in Forest Schools, to be published next month, there is a high probability that it is not a forest school as, it says, large numbers of nurseries, primaries and secondaries are falsely claiming claim to be one. The forest school movement, introduced to the UK about 25 years ago, has taken off in the last decade, partly as an alternative to the formal, test-driven infant and primary curriculum. It is seen as a way of getting children outdoors, in touch with nature and away from their phones and computers. The concept was inherited from Scandinavian outdoor kindergarten lessons and has grown in the UK into a distinct approach to teaching and learning. The lessons are outdoors, usually in wooded areas, and are learner-centred, and play-based. But some schools and nurseries, in both the state and independent sectors, are using the term as a marketing tool. Parents are being misled because the term is being widely used to describe general outdoor \u201cgetting muddy\u201d activities, or one-off environmental sessions. The authors of the book, themselves involved in forest schools, say the idea should be about discovery learning over an extended period, with children involved in meaningful and challenging activities. These should entail some risk \u2013 lighting fires, or learning to use knives, for example. Taking children outdoors to go pond dipping, or to learn about the Vikings, doesn\u2019t make your school a forest school, says Mark Sackville-Ford, a lecturer in education at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) and co-editor of the book. \u201cForest school sets children free to follow their curiosity, it is slightly subversive, an antidote to the results and test-driven classroom,\u201d he says. The book, a collection of papers from academics and teachers, defines the essence of forest schools, the processes by which children learn in the sessions and the challenges for practitioners. Elizabeth Irvin, headteacher of St Mary\u2019s primary in Stockport, which is a forest school, and a contributor to the book, says not all schools are in it for the right reasons. \u201cThe saddest comment I heard was by a headteacher who said \u2018I can\u2019t afford not to do it because every other school around me is doing it and it looks good on your website\u2019,\u201d she says. At St Mary\u2019s, the principles of forest school are embedded for each year group. Businesses have been set up offering \u201cforest school experiences\u201d and training, claiming they improve pupils\u2019 self-esteem and promote healthier lifestyles. Even companies selling products such as rubber boots and waterproofs are jumping on the bandwagon, with one telling teachers that all they need to do to become a forest school is \u201csimply take your lesson outdoors\u201d. Mel McCree, a lecturer in early childhood studies at Bath Spa University, has coined the terms \u201cFS full-fat\u201d for forest schools that follow the principles, \u201cFS lite\u201d for ones that try but don\u2019t succeed, and \u201cFS ultra-lite\u201d for those that are forest schools in name only. Schools are under increased pressure to perform, and at the same time under budgetary pressures, she says. \u201cIn such a climate it is little wonder that settings may use FS lite as part of marketing to compete for new business [children] and that practice can be reduced to a tick-box exercise in this cynical but pragmatic approach.\u201d The Forest School Association (FSA), the professional body in the UK, promotes six principles on which sessions should be based. Not all of its 2,000 members will be leading a full forest school, says Gareth Wyn Davies, its chief executive. There are forest school leaders who are trained and committed but cannot deliver because their schools don\u2019t have the money, or won\u2019t devote the time to it, he says. \u201cIn addition, the term \u2018forest school\u2019 has taken on a life of its own. People are calling anything outdoorsy a forest school when it should be something held over a long period of time, be about child-centred learning and be engagement with the natural world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt focuses on children being guided by their own curiosity rather than completing tasks set by the teacher. They are learning through play and discovery, collaboration and risk taking, climbing trees and using knives.\u201d Forest schools should be offering children another way of learning, says Sackville-Ford. \u201cIn the education system at the moment when all that seems to matter is the Sats score, being a forest school gives legitimacy to other things.\u201d What stands out in his memory is a 10-year-old boy who had little status in the classroom with his more fortunate peers. \u201cIt was quite a prosperous area and he was less successful academically and dismissed by many of his peers. In the forest school environment, when he could shin up a tree and light a fire in seconds, his peer group suddenly changed their approach to him,\u201d he says. However, despite the anecdotal evidence of the benefits, there is a lack of formal research findings, says Mark Leather, a lecturer in outdoor education at the University of St Mark and St John, in Plymouth. He conducted a study of forest school research and reports in his paper \u2013 A critique of forest school: Something lost in translation \u2013 that he found no reliable evidence that it improved pupils\u2019 confidence and self esteem. \u201cI\u2019m a great fan of the forest school movement and the way it seeks to provide a badge of quality but the commodification of it has created problems, including the tendency to make claims for the benefits that overreach the available evidence,\u201d says Leather, a founder member of the British Education Research Association\u2019s new Nature Outdoor Learning and Play special interest group. Done properly, the benefits are there for all to see, says Helen Davenport, a lecturer in primary education at MMU and a co-author of the book. \u201cBeing sat around a fire, being fully immersed in whittling a spoon, erecting a shelter or seeing a pupil in a new light can all fuel romantic thinking about alternative approaches to education,\u201d she says. \u201cYou see children building a shelter with tarpaulins, sticks and ropes or making face paint out of nettles and some making bracelets out of saplings. It\u2019s so calm. It\u2019s magical.\u201d On the other hand, she knows of sessions where what goes on inside is brought outside: \u201cI\u2019ve see written work from the classroom brought outside with worksheets and, on one occasion, desks as well,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is not forest school, nor is it when the children come out to find laminated posters stuck to trees with number challenges and marker pens.\u201d Critical Issues in Forest Schools by Mark Sackville-Ford &amp; Helen Davenport is published by SAGE.
