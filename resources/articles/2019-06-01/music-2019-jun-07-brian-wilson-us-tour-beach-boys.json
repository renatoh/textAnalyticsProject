In a statement, Wilson said he had \u201cbeen living with mental illness for many decades. There were times when it was unbearable but with doctors and medications I have been able to live a wonderful, healthy and productive life.\u201d He said that following surgery on his back, \u201cI started feeling strange and it\u2019s been pretty scary for a while. I was not feeling like myself. Mentally insecure, is how I\u2019d describe it. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with stuff in my head and saying things I don\u2019t mean and I don\u2019t know why. Its something I\u2019ve never dealt with before and we can\u2019t quite figure it out just yet.\u201d He added: \u201cThe music and my fans keep me going and I know this will be something I can again overcome.\u201d He hopes to return to performing this year. Wilson has been diagnosed with a schizoaffective disorder for some time. He once described his symptoms: \u201cFor the past 40 years I\u2019ve had auditory hallucinations in my head, all day every day, and I can\u2019t get them out. Every few minutes the voices say something derogatory to me, which discourages me a little bit, but I have to be strong enough to say to them, \u2018Hey, would you quit stalking me? Fuck off! Don\u2019t talk to me \u2013 leave me alone!\u2019 I have to say these types of things all day long. It\u2019s like a fight.\u201d He has partially attributed his mental health struggles to LSD use. Wilson has maintained a robust touring schedule in recent years, playing shows across the US and Europe alongside former Beach Boy Al Jardine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
