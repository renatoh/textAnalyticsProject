The issue was first raised after Sir Jeremy Beecham, the chairman of the Local Government Association, confided to SocietyGuardian.co.uk in an exclusive interview that he believed the government might be planning the imminent return of free standing elected school boards, as part of its \"new localism\" agenda. The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) had previously said it would not rule out the prospect of school boards similar to the foundation model, whereby elected boards would run education services for the local community. Sir Jeremy made clear his personal resistance to such a move, which he claimed conflicts with the government's commitment to more joined-up services. \"What we are effectively doing is institutionalising fragmentation and bypassing councils,\" he said. Asked if Sir Jeremy's fears might be realised, the DfES admitted such a model might emerge from the restructuring of local education authority finance currently being looked at by the education minister, Charles Clarke. \"No decision has been made yet as to what format the restructure will take,\" a DfES spokesperson said. However, the DfES has since backtracked to take a firm stance against any suggestion of a return to school boards. The department was concentrating on enabling schools to have longer-term budget facilities at their disposal to improve planning, a spokeswoman said today. \"The government has no plans, nor is it considering plans to introduce school boards,\" she said. \"As we said in July, we will continue to work in strong partnership with local government to provide stability and predictability for headteachers and their budgets.\" The original Victorian school boards were introduced under the 1870 Education Act to provide elementary schooling to children in a given area, funded by rates and government grants. They were scrapped three decades later, when local authorities took over responsibility for education at the turn of the century."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
