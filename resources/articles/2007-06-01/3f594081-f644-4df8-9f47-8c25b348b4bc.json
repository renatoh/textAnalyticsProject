On September 11 Saudi Arabian dissidents attacked the US. The logical response would have been to hold Saudi Arabian society up to scrutiny. Look at the issue of basic human rights in the country, see who owns all the oil wealth and how the wealth is distributed - or not. In other words, question whether the west's support for the ruling elite was not part of the problem. Unfortunately, there is too much power and money at stake in maintaining the status quo. The west wants the Saudi oil wealth to be spent in its economies. So the attacks were just used as excuses to invade Afghanistan and Iraq. And Bush's first act after the attacks was to have his Saudi friends escorted from the country. Surely we must realise that persisting with this corrupt status quo is not an option, but the source of world problems? Gavin Lewis Manchester The prime minister and attorney general are right to have security concerns about the massive BAE Systems arms deal. However, both have cited national security merely as a reason for ending or limiting the passing of information to corruption investigators. The real security concern is the fact that the secretive deal, which has helped to keep the feudal dictatorship in Saudi Arabia in place for over 20 years, makes attacks against the UK and its citizens more likely. If the UK is serious about building international peace and security it needs to act ethically and bring an end to the 40-year push of arms to the Middle East. Chris Cole Fellowship of Reconciliation More revelations about the government's cosy relationship with BAE Systems come as little surprise. This relationship has been swaying the government's decisions on arms exports for a decade. A report this month by Saferworld highlights that the government has repeatedly failed to enforce its own policies on the regulation of those exports. Arms continue to be exported to countries with a record of human rights abuse and export licences to Africa have risen to record levels. Tony Blair has been central to this. From the personal intervention overruling ministers opposition to the 2001 deal to sell Tanzania a military air traffic control system worth \u00a328m to the dropping of the SFO Saudi inquiry, Blair has acted as the highest lobbyist for arms companies. It is a habit that his successor needs to break. Claire Hickson Saferworld You say that government concern with the BAE-Bandar issue \"sits oddly ... with Gordon Brown's view that industrial policy must reject special privileges\" (Leaders, June 9). In a Comment piece on a previous page, Carne Ross suggests that we may be paying a grave price for our addiction to arms deals. How did we acquire this addiction? Partly at least it is a result of the \"special privileges\" that we enjoyed post-war, when Germany and Japan were denied access to the business and British industry, led by GEC, forerunner of BAE, saw little interest in being more enterprising when they could make a comfortable living out of government arms contracts. An example of the consequential lost opportunities is in medical diagnostic technology - body scanners. In the 1970s the UK led the world in this field: the first commercial ultrasound and x-ray CT scanners were produced in Britain and MRI was close behind, winning us a Nobel prize on the way. And yet interest from UK industry was patchy at best, and almost all thenow multi-billion pound business - and the jobs - went abroad (much of it to Japan) and stayed there. Water under the bridge perhaps, but there is surely a lesson: we need to identify and nurture our strengths and not be waylaid by temporary special privileges, particularly if they involve unsavoury ethics. Kit Hill Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden Hospital, London So corruption is okay by Tony Blair if it is in Britain's interests, but in the case of African countries means the withdrawal of promised aid that might stop children dying from preventable diseases?
