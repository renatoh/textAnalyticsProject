But Nicholas Hytner\u2019s wild, immersive and original production, without sacrificing comedy, reintroduces \u201cblack-browed night\u201d and emphasises the play\u2019s sexual anarchy. He takes as many liberties as Puck himself, including the handing over of Titania\u2019s lines to Oberon, which, although startling, works intriguingly well and is in keeping with a comedy built on permissive suitor-swapping. The opening startles too: it\u2019s more Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale than Shakespearean comedy. Smart choirs \u2013 women in nuns\u2019 habits, men in suits \u2013 are \u201cchanting faint hymns\u201d. A promenading audience is drawn into this puritanical cult. Perhaps this is a world suggested by Theseus\u2019s threat to Hermia about having to \u201cendure the life of a nun\u201d. Perhaps the unruliest dreams arise out of repressive conditions. Hippolyta is raised high above the heads of the audience in a glass booth \u2013 as in a gone-wrong fairy-tale. Gwendoline Christie plays her with her own brand of weird magic and intensity. This is redoubled as she takes on Titania in a dress like a green silk bank on the move, complete with glittering corsage. Languidly sculptural, she leans from her swing (a nod at Peter Brook\u2019s famous production) to play havoc with the mortals below. Designer Bunny Christie is fearlessly in charge of levitating, ivy-entwined brass beds that alarm as much as any circus act. And there is no shortage of actual circus acts as sleazily glamorous aerialists play the fairies and sensuously doodle in the air, dropping from their cloth perches like hieroglyphs \u2013 a wonder to behold. But at the heart of the evening is a show-stealing Bottom. Upstaging, let us not forget, is Bottom\u2019s ambition: he wants to take on all the parts in the mechanicals\u2019 play. Hammed Animashaun\u2019s simple egotism in the role is adorably jovial and after turning donkey, his laugh disarmingly hangs on to being human before descending into a bray. In this production, it is Oberon who becomes besotted with Bottom. As Oberon, Oliver Chris starts off uncontroversially before getting hilariously and uninhibitedly into the groove, especially in an unforgettable airborne bath scene, complete with bubbles, champagne and ongoing delusion. Bottom endears himself to us by falling in good-naturedly with his new amour. David Moorst\u2019s Puck is riveting: ratty, creaturely, all nervous blink and twitch but with a delinquent grace. At one point, he dives into the audience\u2019s human safety net. The lovers are conventionally cast: a tall, flaxen Helena (Tessa Bonham Jones at home in the role); a dark, doe-eyed Hermia (an excellent Isis Hainsworth, like a child lost in the woods). Lysander (Kit Young) and Demetrius (Paul Adeyefa) are cast like dashing brothers who dally, briefly, with one another. It\u2019s an evening of unsafe magic, exuberantly offset with hits \u2013 Jimmy Cliff\u2019s I Can See Clearly Now, Florence and the Machine\u2019s Only If For a Night, Dizzee Rascal\u2019s Bonkers. You would not want all your Midsummer Night\u2019s Dreams like this but it\u2019s a legitimately dark, energetic dream, and there is always something to delight, amaze or alarm \u2013 it is not only Bottom who is \u201ctransported\u201d. And when, at the end, large moon balloons are tossed into the crowd, it seems the party will go on forever. I found myself calculating: five stars might not be enough. How about throwing in an extra moon? Suitor-swapping also drives Terence Rattigan\u2019s 1943 drawing-room comedy While the Sun Shines. What the butler sees in the bedroom is revealed only by the butler\u2019s rolling eyes (John Hudson is spot on). The show, divertingly directed by Paul Miller, stars the beguiling Philip Labey as the Earl of Harpenden, a leading man who prefers not to lead, with splendid back up from Julian Moore-Cook as Lieutenant Mulvaney, a Yankee who seems too big for the genteel flat in which he finds himself and Lieutenant Colbert, a disputatious Frenchman (amusing Jordan Mifs\u00fad needs only to fine-tune his accent). Dorothea Myer-Bennett is sultry \u2013 and no fool \u2013 as Mabel Crum, the \u201ctrollop\u201d, and Sabrina Bartlett comically earnest (except when tipsy) as Elizabeth, the girl who causes all the trouble. The lightest of light entertainment. Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike, by Christopher Durang, was a Tony-award winning hit on Broadway in 2013. Directed by Walter Bobbie, the comedy leans on Chekhov and sometimes loses its balance (as if Chekhov did not wish to oblige by becoming a prop). For non-Chekhov buffs, the knowing theatrical gags and rehashed melancholy might prove a puzzle. Janie Dee (newly released from her star turn in Follies at the National) plays Masha, a film actress who regrets never having made it on the stage, with poise. She has a toy boy, Spike, in tow (Lewis Reeves amusingly overinhabiting his body). Sonia, a nicely hangdog and mutinous Rebecca Lacey, breaks cups of coffee to demonstrate her frustrations. But it is Mark Hadfield\u2019s Vanya, a tentative and depressive writer, who saves the night when he delivers a tremendous monologue of nostalgia, grief and fear for the planet. Until that moment, I had been contemplating leaving Bath for Moscow.
