Gareth Southgate was with his assistant, Steve Holland, as he often tended to be last summer. They had the European Under-21 Championship to follow in Poland and, simultaneously, the Confederations Cup in Russia. Then one night, in a restaurant on the Black Sea, the discussion turned to England\u2019s plans for the World Cup and changing the entire shape of the side. By that stage, the two men masterminding England\u2019s World Cup campaign were using their time in Russia to look at potential training bases. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t qualified, of course, but without taking liberties we were looking at what might be a good place and experiencing the different climates,\u201d Holland recalls of the conversations that led to England employing their current 3\u20133\u20132\u20132 formation. \u201cWe spent about four weeks on the road in Russia, the two of us. We went back to watch the under-21s when the England games were on and then came back for the Confederations Cup. We spent a lot of time on a plane but it really gave us the opportunity to speak about what we had learned over the year.\u201d More than anything, the two men started bouncing ideas off one another about moving away from the system their predecessors had used. And this, ultimately, is why England are operating in a newly designed formation with wing\u2011backs, three central defenders and no orthodox wingers. \u201cWhen we took over initially I probably don\u2019t need to remind you of the circumstances,\u201d Holland says, taking up the story. \u201cThe previous game was Sam [Allardyce] as manager and the qualification game \u2013 Slovakia away, playing 10 men \u2013 when we got the late [Adam Lallana] goal. The game before that was Iceland in Euro 2016 [under Roy Hodgson]. So Gareth\u2019s first game is: three managers in three games with England, off the back of Iceland and all that still very much in the air. We had two or three days to work and we were in to the qualifiers. \u201cGareth\u2019s an intelligent guy and recognised early on that it wasn\u2019t a time for revolution. It was a time for making decisions that would get results in the short term, to secure qualification. Roy\u2019s system was 4\u20133\u20133. Sam had also used 4\u20133\u20133 in his one game, We went from that to 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 with a No 10 rather than a pivot. And the plan, in the short term, was to get a bit more support to the forwards and hope that was good enough to get us through.\u201d England qualified without losing a game. Yet neither Southgate nor his number two was entirely satisfied. Southgate had played in a three\u2011man England defence under Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle. Holland had coached at Chelsea when Antonio Conte\u2019s team won the Premier League with three at the back. And that night, dining in Sochi, the decision was made that it would be England\u2019s best chance, too. \u201cWe looked at the Terry Venables Euro 96 team, with Steve McManaman and Darren Anderton as wing-backs and Gary Neville in the back three, and the balance of midfield,\u201d Holland says. \u201cWe even went back to Bobby Robson, who started with one way of playing in Italia 90 then went to a back three. But rather than it being something he [Southgate] remembered from the past, the process was: what gives us the best chance of not conceding many goals? What gives us the best chance of having more control of the game with the ball? They were the two factors. \u201cWe watched the matches in the Confederations Cup \u2013 Germany, Portugal, Mexico, Chile, some good teams \u2013 and tried to envisage how we would look against that kind of opposition. We made some decisions and one of those was a back three. We felt we would be better, with and without the ball, with a back three. \u201cI spent a year with Antonio when Chelsea won the league with a 3\u20134\u20133, with [C\u00e9sar] Azpilicueta, a full-back, in a back three, Gary Cahill on the left and David Luiz, as it was then, in the middle. The first time we\u2019d tried it [3-4-3] with England, in the friendly against Germany [in March 2017], we lost the game, but it was a more than reasonable performance. So the next stage was how to get the midfield balance right. We had good forwards and if we played [3\u20133\u20132\u20132] we could get two on the pitch, rather than one. The only criterion, after that, was: \u2018Do we have the wing\u2011backs?\u2019 And the wing\u2011backs are the least of our problems: we have all sorts of different types of wing\u2011backs. So it made sense.\u201d The idea is for Kieran Tripper and Ashley Young to act as auxiliary wingers rather than orthodox full-backs, with Jordan Henderson operating as the pivot and the two attacking midfielders to provide support for Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling. That role went to Jesse Lingard and Dele Alli against Tunisia. However, Ruben Loftus\u2011Cheek is set to play in Sunday\u2019s game against Panama because of Alli\u2019s thigh injury. \u201cThe game against Holland in March was the first time you would have seen us play with two offensive \u2018No 8s\u2019 rather than a [Jake] Livermore, for example, who\u2019s a good player but more defence\u2011minded,\u201d Holland says. \u201cNigeria was the first time we tried Dele there \u2013 the balance of him running forward, the positions Jesse was taking up and Raheem dropping short. That created problems for our opponent. So was it vindication? Probably not, because we could see signs it was coming. But what is interesting is in our last four matches, the opposition has changed at half-time to cope with us three times. \u201cHolland changed at half-time and actually changed again in the second half. Nigeria changed at half\u2011time. And there was a change [from Tunisia] at half-time. That\u2019s usually a good sign, if the opponent is having a problem coping with what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d The new system is set up to be adventurous, in keeping with the \u201cattack the tournament\u201d motto of the squad here in Repino. But is everyone entirely comfortable with it? Kyle Walker, for one, has said he regards himself as an attacking right-back rather than, as Southgate has been using him, a third centre-half. \u201cI\u2019d look at that differently,\u201d Holland argues. \u201cWe\u2019ve watched Manchester City a lot this year and Kyle hasn\u2019t played like he did for Tottenham the previous three years. He hasn\u2019t spent all his time 30 to 40 metres down the touchline. He\u2019s been controlling defensive counterattacks. I\u2019m not sure whether we\u2019re arguing about 20 metres here or there, but we\u2019re not asking him to play behind the [opposition] forward. He\u2019s more or less playing where he has for his club all year and been a champion.\u201d For Holland, these are the moments that vindicate why he became Southgate\u2019s assistant on a full-time basis, leaving Chelsea \u2013 a club he describes as \u201cbrilliant for me \u2026 the most exciting in the world, never a dull moment \u2013 not always good, unfortunately\u201d. But he also takes the point that Harry Kane\u2019s teammates cannot always rely on the captain to score the goals. \u201cThe team is hitting a good level of performance. It\u2019s making more chances, looking more dangerous and what it isn\u2019t doing is finishing games off. It could have been three or four [against Tunisia] at half-time. So what is that? \u201cIf you look at the England team, where are our goals? We\u2019ve been so dependent on Harry \u2026 he\u2019s the one player that has the track record at this level that you can bank on. \u201cAfter that, where are our goals? Dele has goals for Tottenham but hasn\u2019t yet managed to do that consistently [for England]. Raheem has goals [for Manchester City] but hasn\u2019t quite transferred that to international level. Jesse has taken time to get goals for Manchester United. He got into great positions [against Tunisia]. Have we better scoring options in that position? I\u2019m not sure we have. We\u2019re going with the players we think have the potential but they\u2019re young men with not many caps. It might just take a bit of time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
