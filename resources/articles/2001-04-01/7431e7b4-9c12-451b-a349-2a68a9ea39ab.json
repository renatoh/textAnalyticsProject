And, er, that's about it. Well, is there much else remotely to get worked up about? Football's other league titles have been done and dusted - and drowned in drawn-out cliche - for long months now. Where is any competitive edge to the season's finale? We may as well drift off now and be home early: we know the credits just about off by heart. The yawn has been wide and prolonged, the outcome totally predictable. Manchester United have been strolling to another inevitable Premiership title since even before the clocks went back last October. Since when they have hardly been given a single decent workout, scarcely been stretched to anything resembling match tautness - and, by golly, it didn't half show when they went through the motions against Liverpool last weekend before fannying around against Bayern Munich on Tuesday. It is sometimes said of overtrained prizefighters that they have \"left all their form in the gym\". Conversely with Man United - so pallid and meek has been most of their opposition, week in and week out, that they have long been able to treat every match as little more than a gymnasium visit. Which is all they have needed to collect points by the bucketload. But \"match hard\"? United have scarcely had a hard match in years. So when one presents itself, they cannot respond. The resulting lethargy possibly cost them the European Cup last year, and probably ditto this. In the First Division, the Harrods fashion-platers Fulham have also been the obvious runaway champions since leaves were on the trees. So, too, in Scotland, where Celtic have for yonks been such a Sauchiehall Street ahead that even the most rabidly partisan Ranger should, in his right mind, have logically given up bothering. It is the same syndrome almost all over - one rich strutter and the poor masses scrabbling for the crumbs. Domestic seasons are becoming excruciating bores. At rugby union, a long winter, perhaps, but the shortest of short odds since well before Christmas that Leicester would be champions, with the rest nowhere. In the Tigers' case, they even suffered last week from the Old Trafford malaise, sending down virtually a second XV and being beaten by Gloucester - although in Leicester's case it must be 100-1 on that they, at least, will pull themselves together in time to take on the same opponents come their Heineken Cup semi-final. In Wales - oh, drowsy meaninglessness - Swansea and Cardiff still reach neck and neck for the championship. But what's new and vibrant in that? It's even more yawnworthy dull in Scotland, where Melrose have long given up the ghost of catching Hawick. Old Bill might declaim, \"I can tell ye, they'll be dancing in the ol' streets o' Hawick tonight\" - but I doubt they will. The season has long been a foregone conclusion. Well, at least summer's a'coming in... So what? Domestic competitiveness? Fat chance. Sane bookmakers are even baulking at accepting reasonable bets that Surrey will win their third County Championship on the trot - or rather at a canter with their eyes half-closed. You've as much chance of getting a worthwhile bet on Man United not winning next season's Premiership. Do you detect a cyclical syndrome? Yes, cyclical all right - and cynical, too. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
