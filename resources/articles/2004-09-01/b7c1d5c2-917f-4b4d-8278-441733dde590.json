Speaking at a Downing Street press conference with Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, Mr Blair appealed to those who opposed the toppling of Saddam Hussein to back the new fight against Islamist terrorism. He told reporters: \"In this conflict now taking place in Iraq, this is the crucible in which the future of this global terrorism will be determined. \"Either it will succeed and this terrorism will grow, or we will succeed, the Iraqi people will succeed and this global terrorism will be delivered a huge defeat.\" Speaking during a break in No 10 talks, Mr Allawi was also bullish about the threat posed by Iraqi insurgents, who killed 23 people in a suicide bomb attack in Kirkuk yesterday. \"We are succeeding in Iraq,\" he told reporters. \"We are succeeding against the forces of evil.\" Mr Allawi denied that he had asked for more troops to be sent to Iraq, and insisted that the country's elections would go ahead in January as planned. \"We are doing our best to make sure we will meet the time of the elections,\" he said. \"We are adamant democracy is going to prevail in Iraq. \"We are going to stick to this time and I call upon the United Nations to help us in providing whatever it takes to make the elections a success in Iraq.\" The two leaders also discussed the fate of British engineer Kenneth Bigley, who was kidnapped with two American colleagues in Baghdad last week, but remained tight-lipped about progress towards their release. \"Our governments are working closely on it,\" was all Mr Blair would say during the pair's press conference. Today's talks come after the publication of leaked documents suggesting that Mr Blair was warned a year before the invasion of meltdown in Iraq. Mr Blair referred implicitly to the documents today, when he acknowledged that the conflict remains a \"deeply division issue\". And he appealed to those that opposed the war to see that now \"there is only one side for sensible and decent people to be on in this conflict\". Following today's summit, Mr Allawi will attend further talks with the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, before flying off to the UN in New York. He is expected to meet the US president while in America."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
