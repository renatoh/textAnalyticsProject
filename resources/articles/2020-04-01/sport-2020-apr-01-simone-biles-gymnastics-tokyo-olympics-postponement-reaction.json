The Games were due to start in July but have been postponed until the summer of 2021 as major sports events shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Biles, who is arguably the greatest gymnast of all time, was expected to win multiple golds in Tokyo this year. \u201cPhysically I have no doubts that my coaches will get me back in shape, but mentally going another year, I think that is what\u2019s going to take the toll on me and all of us and most of the athletes,\u201d the American told NBC\u2019s Today show. \u201cWe have to stay in shape mentally just as much as physically. That will play a big factor moving forward, listening to your body and your mind.\u201d Biles will be 24 when the Games start next year, an age when most Olympic gymnasts have long since retired. She says the decision to delay the Olympics was correct. \u201cI was actually in the gym training at the time because we were allowed under 10 people ... and I went to the locker and between rotations and I got a text,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what to feel. I just kind of sat there. I cried but ultimately it was the right decision. We need to make sure everyone in the US and around the world is healthy and safe. It was hard but it\u2019s OK.\u201d Athletes face challenges to their training schedule with large parts of the world in lockdown, but Biles said she is finding ways to stay in shape. \u201cI\u2019m in contact through text and FaceTime with my coaches ... so we can figure out a plan moving forward for the next year,\u201d she said. \u201cOther than that, they have sent us at-home workouts. I\u2019m also walking my dog a lot more. Just trying to stay healthy and in shape before we can return to the gym and start the training process again.\u201d Biles has won 30 golds combined at the Olympics and gymnastics world championships. Four of those golds came at Rio 2016, where she was one of the stars of the Games."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
