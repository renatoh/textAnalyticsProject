The Your Taxis campaign has been encouraging customers to share feedback about using Victorian taxis on social media in return for prizes, including free taxi rides for a year. The response was overwhelmingly negative, with customers hijacking the #YourTaxis hashtag to share experiences of being abused, sexually assaulted and harassed by drivers. On Wednesday evening the @YourTaxis account drew the ire of social media users after linking Remembrance Day (which was misspelled) with the campaign. The tweet was subsequently deleted. \u201cWe\u2019ve deleted an inappropriate tweet,\u201d the @yourtaxis account said. \u201cWe are reviewing our processes and will be issuing a media statement soon.\u201d In the statement, the association apologised \u201cunreservedly for a tweet sent on behalf of the YourTaxis campaign that it does not believe displayed the appropriate level of respect to Australian servicemen and women and their families. \u201cThe tweet was sent on the official @yourtaxis Twitter handle by an external supplier, but the association accepts that it should have been reviewed and vetoed by its own staff.\u201d The association\u2019s chief executive, David Samuel, said the taxis industry had the utmost respect for servicemen and women and their families. \u201cThe decision to use an important and significant day like Remembrance Day in any form of marketing was ill-advised, inappropriate and completely unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe apologise to all servicemen and women, their families and the wider community for a mistake that should never have happened.\u201d Later the @yourtaxis account tweeted: \u201cWe are trying so hard to get this right and we are so sorry for our mistakes today.\u201d A spokeswoman for the association said discussions would be held on Thursday with the marketing agency behind the campaign about their future involvement with the association."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
