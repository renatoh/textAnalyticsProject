She was always able to find the right sounds to listen to on the radio. \u201cShe had unerring aim on the dial,\u201d he tells presenter Kirsty Young on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs today. It might sound an unlikely start for a rock\u2019n\u2019roll rebel like Richards, 71, but then he was a boy scout and choir boy. The band, which formed in 1962, continues to play live, Richards explains, because \u201cwe still think we\u2019re getting better. We could be fooling ourselves, but from the response from the audience and the way I\u2019m feeling and the way the boys are playing, is this promise of more and I mean... who is going to jump off a moving bus?.\u201d. All the same, his life is calmer now. \u201cI watch other people rebel now. That\u2019s the image and it\u2019s like a ball and chain, but I recognise it, and I\u2019m in that sort of jail, but at the same time I do love the old Keith. I\u2019m growing up, or rather, evolving. It began with grandchildren, I guess.\u201d Choosing the records of Hank Williams and Chuck Berry to take with him to the island, Richards also speaks frankly about his relationship with Stones\u2019 front man Mick Jagger. He was impressed by Jagger\u2019s knowledge of American music when they met as teenagers and by the fact he sent away to Chicago for new records. \u201cMick and I have a great relationship except when we don\u2019t, which is when everybody hears about it. With Mick, I\u2019ve felt like it\u2019s a brother thing, and which brothers don\u2019t fight occasionally? And we\u2019re always fighting for the right reasons; we just think that our version is more right than the others.\u201d Richards married model Patti Hansen on his 40th birthday in December 1983, and the couple have two daughters. He was previously married to Anita Pallenberg, with whom he had three children together, one of whom died from SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) at two months. He was criticised at the time for appearing on stage on the night of the death, but he tells Young it was the only way he could cope. \u201cIt was such a shock at the time especially... I\u2019m getting a phone call in Paris and this happened in Geneva, and I thought, I\u2019m going to go mad... unless I do this show tonight. \u201cIf I just sit here with this idea, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. Maybe it was just a sense of self-preservation... it was a rough, rough thing. I had a feeling this is a show and I must go on stage. I\u2019ll worry and grieve and think about this all after the show.\u201d Richards chooses one classical track, opting for Vivaldi\u2019s Four Seasons. \u201cI was agonising about this because Mozart is my man, but then I found out reading some of his letters that the only good word he had to say about any other composer was Vivaldi, and then I tried to put this together with being on a desert island... so I chose spring from Vivaldi.\u201d Richards chooses the book Doctor Dogbody\u2019s Leg by James Norman Hall for his island stay and takes a machete as his luxury so he can build a shelter and make a fire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
