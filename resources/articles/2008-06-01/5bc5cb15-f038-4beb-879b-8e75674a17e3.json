Transferring the action, based upon Voltaire's 18th-century satirical novel, to the USA of today, Carsen fashioned a scathing attack upon Bush's America and Europe's supine support for all its excesses. The caricatures of European leaders particularly upset the management at La Scala, Milan which cancelled its plans to host the staging, but later went ahead with a modified version. Now the same production is coming to London as the finale of English National Opera's season. With Toby Spence as Voltaire's naive young hero, and Alex Jennings as his perennially optimistic tutor Pangloss it promises to be a summer highlight, and however the production goes down, the bittersweet score is stuffed with imperishable numbers. \u00b7 London Coliseum, WC2, Mon 23 to Fri 27 Woolrich &amp; Birtwistle Premieres Snape This is Thomas Ad\u00e8s's last festival as Aldeburgh's artistic director, though even that wasn't sufficient incentive for him to get him to finish his new piece for cello and piano that he had included as his farewell. But there are new works from leading British composers in this year's programme, which follow in quick succession in the last few days of the festival. First comes John Woolrich's new violin concerto, composed for soloist Caroline Widmann, who gives the first performance with the Northern Sinfonia conducted by Thomas Zehetmair. On Friday, the Arditti Quartet's recital includes the UK premiere of a new string quartet by Harrison Birtwistle. The Tree of Strings is inspired by a poem by Sorely Maclean, the Gaelic poet who was born on Raasay, the island off the west coast of Scotland where Birtwistle lived in the 1970s. \u00b7 Snape Maltings, Thu 26, Fri 27"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
