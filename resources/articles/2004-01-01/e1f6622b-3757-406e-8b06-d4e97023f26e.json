It snakes along the backbone of the Alps for 150km, crossing more than a dozen passes and glaciers - 5,000 metres of ascent, 7,000m of descent. For many people who have ski-toured (a misleading expression, I think, for what can be incredibly gruelling) the Haute Route (high-level route) is the one you hanker to do. It begins in the shadow of Mont Blanc and ends at the base of the Matterhorn, two of the most famous mountains in the world, and between them is spectacular scenery. First skied in 1911 (it was first walked in 1861, a 10-day trip), the route can only be attempted between mid-March and the end of April, when the days are longer and the snow more settled. What makes the journey even more special is the strange camaraderie that comes from doing such a classic route: the people you meet in the rough and ready mountain huts where you stay understand the pain of the climbing and the exhilaration of the skiing. The isolation grips you too: once you're up above the treeline you won't come down for almost a week, and even car-free Zermatt is an assault on your senses when you arrive. I suppose the one lesson I would pass on to others hoping to undertake the journey is that you're never as fit as you think you are. I'd trained for months, but it was far more physically demanding than I had imagined. On the other hand, it was one of the best experiences of my life. Day 1: A small cheat and three big mistakes We arrive in Chamonix in the middle of a fierce storm. Up the mountain, a metre and a half of snow has fallen overnight. It's a setback on our first day, about which I'm secretly relieved. After we've collected our kit - touring skis, crampons, skins, avalanche radars, shovel - there isn't enough time to make it to the first hut without serious risk of avalanche from the fresh snow. So we cheat: missing the fearsome climb up the Col de Chardonay and skiing the Aiguille du Midi instead. Alain Geloen, our guide and one of Chamonix's most experienced mountain leaders, tells us to glue skins on to the bottom of our skis and we trudge up the Vall\u00e9e Blanche, buffeted by a fierce wind, just to see how we do. After 40 minutes or so we turn round, strip off the skins, and ski down in fresh powder. Alain seems satisfied; I congratulate myself on how fit I feel. His first mistake and mine. My companion and old friend, Roger, feels cheerful enough about the day and what lies ahead to drink a bottle of wine over dinner. A more serious error of judgment, as it turns out. Day 2: Pain and dismay - get me out of here We drive to Verbier, the second stage of the Haute Route, and take the gondola halfway up the mountain. It drops us at 2,193m. Because it's the last day of the season the chairlifts that would normally take us further up the mountain are closed and we start our ascent. The day is overcast, with specks of drifting snow. Skins on skis, we start walking, a slow deliberate, rhythmic shuffle back and forth. The trick with skins is to slide rather than clump up the slope, your detached heels pushing the ski for ward, although after hours of the same movement your shins feel as if they've suffered a severe kicking. As the slope gets steeper, you can set your heel support at different levels, as if walking on wedges, to help follow the contours. I find out later that the first pass we climb is the Col de la Chaux, at 2,794m. Later, I was to become obsessed with heights. Today, I don't know what climbing 750m will feel like with a full rucksack. Two hours later, heart pumping and shins aching, we reach the top. Pathetically, I feel a sense of achievement. Alain is indifferent, and merely points to the next pass, the Col de Momin at 3,003m. We ski towards it. I trail behind the guide and Roger as we push up the slope. I stop repeatedly. My rucksack - stuffed with climbing gear, bread, cheese and chocolate bars and a minimum of clothing - is already straining my shoulders. I am mortified that I find the going so hard, after months and months of training in the gym to bring this office worker up to scratch. To my dismay, I am hating the experience and I am only halfway through the second day of a five-day trip. Alain tries to encourage me by telling us that after this pass, we begin the ski towards the hut. Shock. At the summit Alain announces that he miscalculated the route and that there is a third pass to climb before we begin the descent to the hut. This hurts Roger more than me and he goes into steep emotional decline. Two hours later I am 50m behind Alain and Roger is out of sight. We wait for him. It is now 6pm. Alain curses quietly and goes back to help him by carrying his rucksack. I sit in the snow, find that my mobile has a signal and phone home. Close to tears, I ask repeatedly, maniacally, how to call a helicopter. I see the guide coming back with Roger and guiltily ring off. We arrive at the Parfleuri hut (2,624m) at 7.30pm, nine hours after we started. Alain tells me it was the slowest climb he has ever made. Day 3: Only there by the skins of my skis The weather is going to be glorious, but the day begins with an argument over what time we should set off. Alain wanted us up at 5.30am because we were so slow yesterday, Roger grumbles that it's unnecessarily early. He wins by obstinately refusing to get up from his bunk in our communal dorm and lingering over the meagre breakfast. We leave at 7.15am and immediately begin the climb up the Col des Roux (2,804m). It's not a long climb, but the slope is so steep we have to attach crampons to our skis as well as skins to stop ourselves sliding back. My shins are in agony, bruised from the repeated sliding motion of skinning. I discover strange muscles in strange places. I think longingly of painkillers. At the summit, I get my first sense of why people endure the Haute Route. The view is spectacular: hundreds of metres below us is an icy blue lake; ahead of us, range after range of snow-covered mountains; in the far distance the distinctive shape of the Matterhorn, our ultimate destination. We ski down to start traversing the lake, high above the shore-line. I follow Alain as closely as I can, concentrating on the backs of his yellow skis. Skinning, I realise, is as much about mental control as physical ability - the aim is to try to fall into a semi-hypnotic state where pain is numbed. I try counting, forwards and backwards to 100, a hundred times. Roger is in trouble. He's fallen behind and I can't see him but I can hear him swearing viciously at his rucksack, his skis and most of all at the snow. He has a point: the terrain is horribly hard. The slope above us has repeatedly avalanched in the previous few weeks and the track takes us over huge lumps of ice and snow. Alain, a quiet and reserved man, looks shocked as he hears Roger's curses carried towards us on the still air. I wonder whether to explain to him that this is not out of character for Roger, known for his fruity language. We stop for a break and surreptitiously I take Nurofen. We pour water down our throats. The sun is now high in the sky and oppressively hot, so we strip off layers. Even with no jackets and no gloves the sweat drips off us, mingled with suncream and snot. Alain urges us to eat something for strength. Roger refuses, saying he feels too sick to swallow. At the end of the lake we have to climb steeply up the Pas de Chat (2,386 metres). Alain tells Roger he will take his rucksack on the climb, because we're going too slowly. I am deeply jealous and want mine carried too. The climb is awful - so steep that I cannot execute the kick turns necessary to zig-zag up the slope, and lie helplessly in the snow. Alain, who even with two rucksacks doesn't slow down, shows no sympathy. Two hours later, the final climb of the day is the Pas de Chevres, at 2,855m where a steep ladder has been fitted for the final bit. Roger is at breaking point: a big strong man, he wails at Alain that he can't make it up the slope. I sit, breathless and parched since I've run out of water and wait for him, aware of Alain's growing dismay at our performance. Somehow we both make it up the ladder and begin the ski down to Arolla, the hamlet where we are to stay the night. It's so late in the afternoon that the snow is thick and heavy. I fall clumsily and, for the first time, nearly weep. This is supposed to be fun? In the small hotel we sit, comatose, sipping beer. It has taken us 10 hours to get here. Alain tells us that he thinks we should stop and go back to Chamonix: the climb tomorrow will be far harder than those we've done today. Roger concurs, saying he's had enough and will return to Chamonix. I'm devastated. The humiliation! I've wanted to do this trek for 10 years and we're being sacked by the guide! My friend tells me I should try to go on without him. Alain is reluctant, but doesn't rule it out: it's a yellow card, not red for me. I resolve to go on and then bitterly regret it over dinner, as I watch Roger visibly relax, drinking and smoking with abandonment. Day 4: The mountain wins - three become two I've had a terrible night panicking about the day ahead. But once we start I'm so desperate to show Alain that I'm up to it that, skis strapped to my rucksack, I start walking absurdly fast up the valley to the start of the glacier. He tells me to slow down. An hour later we're at the base of Mont Collon. We turn left and skin up towards the ridge. To my surprise I find it much easier going than yesterday. I think about Roger, probably still in bed, and wonder if he, too, would have found it quite easy. We round the corner, and see a shepherd's hut where we rest and eat: the bread I bought in Chamonix is now three days old and the cheese is as sweaty as I am. Looking to the right, I suddenly see the tiny speck at the top that is the Bertol hut, where we are heading. It looks impossibly high and distant. We begin the climb. Alain is right, this is the most gruelling of them all. And yet there's something about being able to see your destination that makes it less daunting. We climb, slowly and steadily, over the contours of the mountain. A shadow coming up on my left turns out to be a man of about 60, who is climbing much faster than us, and almost straight up the mountain rather than zig-zagging. Alain says that's the Swiss way. An hour on and it gets seriously steep. We are now so high that I'm beginning to pant like a dog. All I can think about is water. I look up and count the number of traverses and kick-turns left before we reach the hut. It's a mistake. From a distance it's easy to miscount, leaving you feeling cheated. But I know I'm going to make it and I feel elated as I execute the final kick- turn and climb to the foot of the hut. It is only 1.30pm, six and a half hours since we left Arolla. The hut is extraordinary: perched on a crag about 20m above our heads. When the original hut was built in the 1940s, travellers had to pull themselves up by chains, now there's a precarious ladder, and even though Alain tells me I can't fall I am shaking with fear and exhaustion as I mount it. Safely inside the hut I am euphoric: thrilled with myself but unable to boast about my achievement because I can't get a mobile signal. I am joyous when Alain congratulates me and tells me how well I climbed - we've arrived half an hour before he predicted. Later that afternoon I lie on my dormitory bunk - eight mattresses on the top platform, eight on the bottom - under a pile of blankets and think about home and a bath. I'm too excited to sleep and too tired to read. For the first time on the trip I understand what makes the Haute Route one of the great mountain treks, and know why something that is so gruelling and painful can also be so deeply satisfying. It's the first time, too, that I enjoy hut life. There are three other groups there tonight: two Swiss, one American, and the atmosphere is warm and comradely as we pore over maps and compare journeys. Before I go to bed at 9.30pm (lights-out in the dormitories is at 10) I wash my teeth with bottled water over the side of the walkway by the hut. In front of me is the Dame Blanche, to the right the Matterhorn, lit by the last of the sunset and the emerging stars. Day 5: The home run and a final twist Alain tells me today is easy compared with yesterday. I don't believe him and feel nervous all over again as we eat a frugal breakfast. It's before 6am and the sun is not yet up, but I can see one of the Swiss groups already skiing down the mountain we climbed yesterday. We are heading the other way, to climb the Tete Blanche (a 400m climb to 3,710m) and then ski down the glacier, past the Matterhorn to Zermatt. We ski from the hut, on some of the best snow so far. Ten minutes later we begin what will be our last climb of the trip. And it's fine: two hours 20 minutes later we are at the summit of the Tete Blanche. We look back and see a line of ants on the mountain on the other side of the hut where the Americans are climbing to the summit. When I get back to London there is a picture of us (see page 3) two ants on our mountain, taken by them. Skiing down the Tete Blanche towards Zermatt is the most wonderful descent of the whole trip - the snow is good and I'm not tired, I ski properly rather than like the beginner I become when exhausted. We ski for at least an hour before our luck runs out at the bottom of the glacier. It's been so hot that the snow that should have carried us through to the resort has largely melted. At first we traverse along the valley, following the trail over rocks, earth, streams and patchy snow. I'm glad my skis are rented. Then the only option is to walk with our skis strapped to our rucksacks. We do so, for an hour and a half. Alain offers to carry my skis, but I foolishly refuse out of perverse pride. My feet are so hot and sweaty that I'm getting blisters, but I'm driven on by knowing how close I am to finishing. It's infuriating and tricky having to walk down what should be a ski slope - that's the trouble with doing the Haute Route so late in the season - but the scenery is also wonderful. Trees are budding and there are flowers everywhere which we crush with our boots. As we follow the trail to the cable car, we re-enter the world of chocolate-box chalets and cows with tinkling bells. I have a sudden, desperate desire to go home. In the square in Zermatt I buy Alain a beer and we sit in silence. Then he reaches across the table and grabs my hand. 'I was wrong about you,' he says. 'You should be very proud of yourself.' \u00b7 Georgina Henry is deputy editor of the Guardian.
