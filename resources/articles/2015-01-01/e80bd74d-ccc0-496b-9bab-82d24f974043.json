Although it is understood Sunderland have conducted preliminary talks with three MLS clubs, no fee has been agreed for a player who cost \u00a36.5m when he came to Wearside from AZ Alkmaar. Toronto FC, Portand Timbers and Altidore\u2019s old club New York Red Bulls are monitoring his situation along with France\u2019s Lille but Gus Poyet suggested it may be nearer the end of the month before any move occurs. \u201cThey know more in America than me,\u201d said Sunderland\u2019s manager, whohopes to replace Altidore with a more prolific finisher in the next three weeks. \u201cThe agent was coming over two or three months ago but, since then, nothing.\u201d Poyet, who said Altidore was in the squad for Saturday\u2019s game at home to Liverpool, added: \u201cOfficially there has been no approach for any of our players so we need to wait. But with Jozy things are clear \u2013 we talk together a lot and we are both very clear on what the future should bring.\u201d Greg Vanney, the Toronto coach, has been a little more forthcoming, not to mention rather less cryptic. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll throw our hat in the ring. He [Altidore] knows the league. He knows North American soccer. He has experience internationally and he\u2019s a big, strong forward. I think he can score goals in this league.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
