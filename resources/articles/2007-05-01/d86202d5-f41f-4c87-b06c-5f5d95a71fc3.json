There must be a more exciting solution, more respectful of the old ship. As a boy I loved it so much that I crawled every inch, knew every mast, spar and rope by name and dreamed of furling them on the high seas as they strained and throbbed beneath me. I even \"signed on\" as a junior shipmate in the naive belief that she might one day take me to sea with her. With historic ships then lining the banks of the Thames, Cutty Sark's imprisonment in concrete broke my heart (and my ambition to join the navy). The original plan to restore the ship, for which the lottery gave \u00a311m and a further \u00a312m is being sought, took this mummification a drastic stage further. Keel, metal plates and much of the woodwork needed replacing. Only the masts, spars and deck fittings were likely to be original to the naked eye. Meanwhile the dry dock was to have a \"sea of glass\", while lifts, disabled access, audio-visual displays, signage and that curse of historic buildings - a \"learning zone\" - were added to attract government money uninterested in pure restoration. When this project was launched two years ago, I pleaded for a proper rebuild, using the salvageable parts of the old ship, but one that could sail, not just float. Cutty Sark was constructed a quarter-century after the advent of steam ships, to be the fastest vessel afloat and still driven by wind. Everything was designed to turn the force of nature into speed. Take away wind, sea and speed and this was just another landlocked museum ship. Meanwhile even the Cambria, a Thames sailing barge, has been wrenched from museologists who threatened her with a Cutty Sark fate, and is being returned to working order by a trust. Ships should sail. As Conrad said, ports are places where they rot and sailors go to the devil. The new, post-fire Cutty Sark must have most of its woodwork and metalwork replaced, and perhaps some of its iron frame. It must therefore fall into the grey area between authentic and replica where total ideological confusion reigns. Another famous vessel, Donald Campbell's Bluebird, was dredged from the depths of Coniston and then refused a grant because heritage officials rejected the plan to restore it as the boat had been at the start of its fatal last run. They wanted it \"conserved as found\", a crashed and mangled wreck and thus \"true to its history\". On this absurd basis the Heritage Lottery Fund should demand that Cutty Sark's blackened ruin be left as it is, its history ending as a noble monument to arson. That should be worth a couple of million for a youth education centre. Yet nobody queried the complete reconstruction of Uppark House in Sussex, gutted by fire in 1989, or the rebuilding after the Hampton Court and Windsor Castle fires. There is no rhyme or reason to this. A London Victorian house may not have a dormer added to its roof, but the entire city skyline can be wrecked with 50-storey towers. These are not rules but prejudices - and money talking. The replica debate is nowhere fiercer than in the vintage car business. Here owners must keep their vehicles roadworthy yet face decayed metalwork, brake linings, woodworm and leather. How vintage is vintage is the question, though largely a philosophical one. The eligibility rules of the pre-1940 Vintage Sports-Car Club stipulate that \"the date of the car shall be the date of the youngest major component, chassis, engine, gearbox and axles\". However, \"items of a later date may be substituted ... if they are identical to the original.\" Tyres and brake can, mercifully, be renewed and hydraulic conversion is allowed in certain classes. There is also a sportsmanlike class of \"post-vintage thoroughbred (1940-60)\", where the style and most components are identical to an original, but allowing a repositioning of axles, engine, gearbox and even wheelbase. These can seem absurd distinctions. A 1919 6.5-litre Hispano-Suiza remains the finest car ever built, even if those that survive are mostly assembled from repairs and replacements. The car is still the car. The design, the artifice and essence of the manufacture, is retained. Altering, even replacing, the fabric of a car or a house need not destroy its continuous character, or the aesthetic and emotional appeal it may have to those who love and wish to experience it. This debate is as old as history, or at least as old as Bramante, Palladio, Pope, Walpole, Ruskin and Morris. The postwar zest for rebuilding bombed buildings, and even towns, in Russia, Poland, Germany and France was essential to a rebuilding of national pride. Britain's planners merely continued where the bomber left off, as can be seen in modern Coventry, Plymouth, Bristol and east London. What they created is having to be demolished as unusable all over again, while replicated Warsaw, Munich, Tours and Caen can reasonably claim to be \"historic\". Cutty Sark was, first and foremost, a work of engineering, like a great mill or steam engine. It craves its context. Remove that context and it is like dumping the Flying Scotsman on King's Cross forecourt, cramming Concorde into a museum or rebuilding London Bridge in the Arizona desert. Cutty Sark's apologists plead that they must respect conservation theory and obey New Labour policy, that all such projects must be drained bloodless of their vitality in the cause of education, the disabled and ethnic minorities. In reality they are stuck with a plan that may be politically correct but has been outdated by tragic events. If \u00a325m, or now \u00a330m, is to turn a blackened hulk into what amounts to a classroom replica, let us stop and think. If any ship merited the epithet \"post-vintage thoroughbred\", it is Cutty Sark. As a replica there can be no sensible objection to rebuilding it to its original specifications with the original fittings and rigging, and discreetly adding the requisite navigational aids and auxiliary power. If government inspectors are determined to make this impossible - and they will try - then move the job to Rochefort in France, where L'Hermione is being rebuilt, or study Australia's James Craig or Texas's Elissa. The world is full of working square-rigged ships, both authentic and replica. Why has Britain such a hang-up? Richard Branson's Virgin is offering tourist trips to outer space, a project already on my wish list of lifetime experiences. But it pales against my dream of standing at the wheel of Cutty Sark with the Roaring Forties screaming in my face and round me the creaking, groaning roar of a four-master under full sail. The Cutty Sark trust says that it wants people to be able to walk under the hull, and intends to recreate life aboard \"through modern technology\". In which case the trust need not rebuild a replica interior at all, and can leave the Cutty Sark \"experience\" to the admirable National Maritime Museum next door. As for the cost of keeping Cutty Sark afloat, other nations manage their tall ships and with pride. As for my own passage, I would mortgage my house to pay for it, and I bet thousands would do likewise. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
