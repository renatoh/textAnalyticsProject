Facing his accuser for the first time at a professional conduct hearing, Stephen Clark, 42, said the claim came after his family had been attacked \"by the full force of the state\". His wife was in prison for the murders of their baby sons, his surviving son, Child A, had been temporarily put into care and he had lost everything he had worked for. At times Mr Clark, whose wife, Sally, had her murder convictions quashed last year, seemed close to tears as the GMC professional conduct hearing in Manchester was told of Prof Southall's attempts to remove his toddler. Prof Southall, one of the most respected child protection experts in the UK, made his allegation after seeing Mr Clark on television discussing his wife's convictions before her appeal. At first Mr Clark said he thought the claim was a \"sick joke\". \"But then I realised it wasn't. It was very serious and could have some very serious consequences for me,\" he said. Prof Southall's allegation centred on a nose bleed which Mr Clark's first son, Christopher, suffered in a hotel when he was alone with his father, nine days before he died in December 1996, aged 11 weeks. Having watched Mr Clark describe the incident on Channel 4's Dispatches programme, the consultant told police the bleed could only have happened as a result of attempted suffocation by Mr Clark. He said the father had killed Christopher, and in January 1998 also suffocated his second child, Harry, aged eight weeks. As a result Prof Southall, who denies serious professional misconduct, believed that the third child was not safe in the father's care. In April 2000, with his son back in his care and an appeal against his wife's conviction due in two months Mr Clark was trying to get his life back to normal when out of \"left field\" he received letters telling him of Prof Southall's belief that he had killed his babies. He was later sent the consultant's full report and was further astounded by its contents. \"It seemed unbelieveable in the circumstances because he had not ... seen any of the medical evidence in the case.\" Prof Southall was invited to a formal review by social workers into the care of Mr Clark's son and tried to see the papers in the case, but he was refused by the family court. Guy Mitchell, a social worker who was Child A's guardian, said he felt that Prof Southall had no choice but to alert the authorities. The hearing continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
