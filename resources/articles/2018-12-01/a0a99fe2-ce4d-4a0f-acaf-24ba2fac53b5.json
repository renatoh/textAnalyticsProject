Voters can expect the Coalition to use the vastly improved budget condition to its favour in the election, with the prospect of more tax cuts on the table. In its mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) statement, the government said higher-than-expected commodity prices in 2018 had contributed to expected tax receipts being revised up by $25.9bn over the four years to 2021-22. The revision reflects stronger-than-expected tax collections from individuals and companies, stronger employment growth projections and higher growth in corporate profits in 2018-19, particularly mining company profits. That means the budget will move from a deficit of $5.2bn in 2018-19 to a surplus of $4.1bn in 2019-20, with that surplus projected to grow to $12.5bn in 2020-21, and to $19bn in 2021-22. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg used the opportunity to amend a famous quote from former Labor treasurer Paul Keating, saying: \u201cThese are the surpluses that Australia needs to have.\u201d But the government is already planning to use some of the larger savings in the budget to announce billions of dollars of election commitments \u2013 its \u201cdecisions taken but not yet announced\u201d show the government will announce $9.2bn in extra spending over the next three years. It will allocate $2.4bn in 2019-20, $3.8bn in 2020-21 and $3bn in 2021-22. That could include future tax cuts, or personal individual tax cuts that have already been announced being brought forward. Asked if the government\u2019s election pitch would include further tax cuts, Frydenberg said: \u201cWe are committed to targeted spending and lower taxes \u2026 but we\u2019re not going to make any announcements today.\u201d But the news for workers\u2019 wages is not so rosy, with the government cutting its forecast for wages growth from six months ago. Treasury expects wages will grow by 3% in 2019-20, down from 3.25% in the May budget. But it then projects wages growth will pick up to 3.5% in 2020-21 and 2021-22. Other important economic indicators have also been revised down. Real GDP growth for 2018-19 has been revised down from 3% in the May budget to 2.75%; consumption growth from 2.75% to 2.5%; dwelling investment from 1.5% to 1%; inflation from 2.25% to 2%; and exports of goods and services from 4% to 2%. But the terms of trade (the prices the world is paying for Australia\u2019s exports relative to the prices Australia has been paying to import goods) have received a huge boost thanks to surging commodity prices. In the May budget, the government was expecting the terms of trade for 2018-19 to decline by 5.25%, but now it expects the terms of trade will improve by 1.25% this year. That has seen nominal GDP (the money Australia receives for the goods it produces) improve by a full percentage point in the last six months \u2013 from 3.75% growth expected in May to 4.75% today. As a result of its improved budget position, and the government\u2019s projected larger surpluses, net debt as a share of GDP is projected to decline faster than expected over the next decade, from 18.2% ($351.9bn) in 2018-19 to 1.5% ($48.4bn) in 2028-29. In its May budget, the government had projected net debt would be 3.8% of GDP in 2028-29. But debt projections have repeatedly been missed \u2013 in the Abbott government\u2019s first budget in 2014-15, then-treasurer Joe Hockey estimated net debt would decline from 13.9% of GDP in 2014-15 ($226.4bn) to just 0.7% of GDP by 2024-25. Net debt is roughly $177bn higher than it was when the Abbott government took office in 2013 (it was $174.5bn on 30 September 2013). The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the government\u2019s improved budget position had much to do with the improved international economy. \u201cWhat we have seen in this economic update today \u2026 is that growth is down, investment growth is down, wages growth is down, consumption growth is down,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the only thing that\u2019s up is the terms of trade \u2013 what the world is prepared to pay us for our commodities \u2013 the one thing which this government has absolutely no influence over is up. \u201cWhen it comes to wages growth and consumption, we\u2019re seeing the fruits of the government\u2019s poor economic policy and the chaos and confusion at its heart.\u201d But Frydenberg said the budget update was a demonstration that the Coalition government\u2019s economic plan was working. \u201cOne of the proudest achievements of the government has been the creation of over 1.1m new jobs since we were elected in 2013,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has seen the unemployment rate fall to a six-year low of 5%. We have completed our 27th consecutive year of economic growth and the Australian economy is growing faster than the OECD average and of all G7 nations, except the United States. \u201cThe underlying cash balance for 2019-20 is now expected to reach a surplus of $4.1bn \u2026 this will be the first budget surplus since the last year of the Howard government.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
