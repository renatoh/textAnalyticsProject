The anonymous street artist\u2019s Christmas creation combines jolly sentiment with genuine compassion in a way that would make the Victorian author of A Christmas Carol tingle all over. What\u2019s more, his latest artwork is both imaginative and thumpingly true \u2013 a Christmas cracker with a bang of reality inside. Banksy\u2019s team of reindeer painted on a wall in Birmingham\u2019s Jewellery Quarter, pulling a bench that homeless people use as a bed, is rightly popular. In a video that underlines his message, Banksy shows a man called Ryan having a drink before positioning a bag as a pillow and lying on the bench \u2013 to be, in dreams, lifted in the air by those magic reindeer while the soundtrack plays I\u2019ll Be Home for Christmas. It has so far had nearly three million views on Instagram. Once again Banksy reaches the parts other artists miss. This is a good painting \u2013 the reindeer are nicely three-dimensional and solid enough to make the trompe l\u2019oeil segue from street bench to wonderland work. But the cleverest thing about this bighearted artwork is that it does not depict \u201cthe homeless\u201d. By attaching his reindeer to an empty bench, it lets homeless people represent themselves. Banksy not only named Ryan in the video but also thanked the locals who spontaneously brought him a hot drink, chocolates and lighter during the filming of the short video. Presumably not everyone who uses the bench is destitute, so this work of art will be given other meanings \u2013 some wag has already added Rudolf\u2019s red nose. That\u2019s street art and it\u2019s kind of wonderful. But in allowing Ryan and others with no home to draw attention to their own reality, Banksy avoids the depressing tendency of art to either abstract them and rob them of identity, or indulge in triteness, or exploit a desperate reality for aesthetic effect. This is sadly true of some very well-meaning art. Andrea B\u00fcttner\u2019s series of woodcuts entitled Beggar, shown in the 2017 Turner prize, is a splurge of bourgeois guilt \u2013 but instead of portraying specific people she depicts simplified eternal stereotypes of pleading. Like many, perhaps, she can\u2019t bear to look closely at the actual sleepers or cupholders in the doorways. Then again, artists who do focus on desperate individuals have some bad luck too. Gillian Wearing\u2019s 1999 video Drunk shows a group of street alcoholics playing themselves in a whitened studio \u2013 their exact housing situation isn\u2019t recorded. But Wearing\u2019s video is facile, turning harsh real life into middle-class entertainment. This is what Banksy brilliantly avoids. Not for him the shock effects of Boris Mikhailov\u2019s photographs of homeless Russians. Defenders of this visually gifted photographer claim he explores the \u201cunderground\u201d of society with Dostoevskyan courage \u2013 and that his portrayals of the homeless in his 1997-98 work Case History accurately diagnosed the sickness of post-Soviet Russia. But Mikhailov\u2019s relish for sores, toothless mouths and naked drunkenness turns his subjects into a spectacle. It\u2019s clearly not easy to represent homelessness in art. Perhaps that\u2019s why Andy Warhol never did so, even though he is one artist who genuinely cared about it. After Warhol died it emerged that the supposedly celebrity-obsessed artist regularly worked in New York soup kitchens. Two other artists who are known to help the homeless directly in their Spitalfields neighbourhood are Gilbert and George. As a \u2013 discreetly \u2013 religious artist, the devoutly Catholic Warhol was heir to an artistic tradition in which the poor and homeless have been depicted with humanity and character. Two pilgrims or beggars who revere the Virgin Mary in Caravaggio\u2019s painting the Madonna of Loreto are explicitly depicted as homeless: the Madonna stands in a doorway while they are kneeling in the street. We can see the man\u2019s naked dirty feet. In his Naples masterpiece The Seven Acts of Mercy, a naked street beggar is given a cloak and a homeless pilgrim is sheltered. There was no Big Issue in 17th-century Spain but the ragged man in Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s painting The Water Seller of Seville is both desperate and dignified as he does a humble job and plays his part in the community. The model was apparently a man known as the Corsican of Seville who used to show his scabs and sores as well as sell water. Why were 17th-century artists better than 21st-century ones at representing the poorest? Probably because homelessness, paupery and begging were more included and embraced in the community than they are today. In Catholic countries, alms and charity were fundamental religious imperatives. And anyone could become poor \u2013 like Rembrandt when he went bankrupt. Today, there\u2019s a wall of stigma between the homeless and the homed. Banksy\u2019s Christmas miracle bridges that divide, as it invites homeless people to use it and their neighbours to interact with them. It\u2019s a sensitive and far-seeing work of art and a thoughtful gift."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
