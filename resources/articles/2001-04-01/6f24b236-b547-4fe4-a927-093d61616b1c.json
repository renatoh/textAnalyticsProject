He timed his move well. Once one of the most admired men in British banking, Burt has seen his reputation dented by the failure of two previous deals. Crosby made his initial call to Burt just after Abbey National abruptly called off their merger talks while the Competition Commission crawled over the rival bid from LloydsTSB. It was Burt's lowest point. Just 18 months earlier, he had been hailed as a heroic visionary when he launched his audacious bid for NatWest. Now, he was looking like the perennial runner-up, having seen two potential deals snatched from his grasp. While he continued to insist that BoS had no need to merge, his protestations that the bank had plenty of opportunity for organic growth were starting to sound a little hollow. For Crosby, as well, the approach required a bit of back-tracking. At the group's results announcement just weeks before, he had dismissed the idea of Halifax taking part in the wave of banking consolidation, insisting that it did not need a deal. Its strategy of offering great deals on mortgages and current accounts would provide all the growth it needed. That, both sides now say, is just the point. Neither needs to do a deal, but as a combined force they would be far better equipped to continue waging their guerrilla war against the competition. 'This deal is not about consolidation,' said one well placed source. 'Consolidation is about bringing together two similar infrastructures with a view to eliminating at least one of them. In this case, we want to bring together two very different infrastructures to generate additional growth.' The arguments are straightforward enough. Halifax is determined to increase its share of the current account market but, even though its new account, paying 4% interest on balances, took a fifth of the 500,000 accounts which were moved last year, it still faces a hard task in winning 12% of the market. Crosby is also aware that margins on small business banking are more than double that in the fiercely competitive retail market, but it lacks the expertise to make a significant impact on the market. BoS is excellent at providing both these services but it lacks the branch network to distribute them as all but 23 of its 330 branches are in Scotland. It is growing through joint ventures - its deal with Sainsbury's Bank, for example and through forays into countries such as Holland and Ireland. But the amount of business is small, and its ability to aggressively expand these opportunities is hampered by lack of capital. Halifax, with its millions of deposit and savings accounts, can offer the Scottish bank access to cheap and relatively plentiful funds for expansion. The City seems largely to buy the arguments. 'If nothing else happens, it is not a bad deal,' said David Rough, investment director at Legal &amp; General. David Manning of Foreign &amp; Colonial. agreed: 'I am generally favourable. 'Halifax has talked a good story, but it has been slow at delivering. It is all in the execution. Everyone knows what banks should do; the problem is doing it. Bank of Scotland is good at the execution.' Like other shareholders, he would prefer Burt to get the job of running the bank. Crosby, however, may disagree. The vexed question of dividing up the top jobs, and the location of the head office, was occupying much of the discussions at the meetings which continued over the weekend. One suggestion is that Burt, who is 56, could take the top job until he retires in three or four years, when Crosby, a youthful 45, could succeed him. The balance would be redressed at chairman level, where Halifax chairman Lord Stevenson, a well-regarded figure in the City, could remain in the chair - that is, if he is not poached to take Sir Christopher Bland's job as chairman of the BBC. The danger is that this will be less a diplomatic compromise and more of a fudge, which could hamper the process of getting the two banks together. 'I think there is a great danger that it is being portrayed as a merger,' said one leading shareholder, who preferred not to be named. 'The great advantage with NatWest [which was taken over by Royal Bank of Scotland a year ago] is that the Royal could go in and say \"We are in charge. This is what you will do and how you will do it.\" If you split the jobs, each will say \"Such and such is a good fellow and he must be kept\". A clear decision on management is, if anything, even more important with two well-managed businesses. It is very easy for them to slip into not being run by anyone.' BoS and and Abbey are believed never to have reached agreement on who would take the top jobs before their merger was aborted. Indeed, one analyst says that Burt was continually promising things and agreeing deals only to find that objections from his board forced him to recant. The number of dissenting, though anonymous, 'senior executives' quoted in the Scottish papers last week suggests that could have some foundation. This time round, however, the pressure will be on Burt to reach an agreement. 'He has got to the position of three strikes and you are out,' said Manning. 'If he can't pull it off, he will have to exit stage left. That may put him in a compromising mood.' While jobs will inevitably go, neither side is presenting the deal as a cost-cutting option. Analysts are pencilling in relatively minor cost savings - Simon Samuels at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, for example, thinks that they could eventually reach \u00a3320m, or 11% of total costs, similar to that promised by Lloyds for Abbey but well below what BoS thought it could squeeze out of NatWest. He is more pessimistic on revenues, forecasting just an extra \u00a3250m - although others, such as James Alexander at Commerzbank, estimates a much more generous \u00a3900m. The leaking of the deal prompted the predictable round of speculation about rival bidders who might make it third time unlucky for Burt. Many of the obvious contenders are, however, all but ruled out. Barclays is said to harbour a longstanding desire for BoS. But its chief executive Matt Barrett has just about ruled out hostile deals, and a friendly deal is surely impossible, at least while the Halifax talks are going on. A hostile bid from Barclays would be a big risk, given that the Competition Commission sets such store by the creation of a 'fifth force' in small business banking. BoS and Halifax would surely argue that a takeover by Barclays was just an attempt to stop them creating one. The RBS is mooted as a bidder for Halifax after Fred Goodwin, its chief executive, expressed an interest in mortgage lenders at the bank's results presentation earlier this year. What he said, however, is that he would be prepared to consider 'mercy killings' when these lenders found themselves struggling to survive - and Halifax is a long way from being in that position. There are, however, two banks which could fit that category - Alliance &amp; Leicester and Northern Rock. While investors are prepared to let Northern Rock pursue its strategy of concentrating solely on lending and savings, they are keen to see A &amp; L - which is more diversified but a poorer performer - enter into bid talks. National Australia Bank, touted as a bidder for both Halifax and BoS, would be likely to find that a much more digestible deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
