It's that same blend of pride and disappointment that one feels whenever something we hold dear suddenly catches on - like when an underground band whose first CD you bought suddenly goes platinum. The reason that MOTD2 makes me feel this way is because I'm a big fan of its presenter, Adrian Chiles. Or, at least, I'm a big fan of his \"early work\" - namely Working Lunch, the daily business and finance show on BBC2, which Chiles has fronted for 10 years. It's not so much the content of Working Lunch that I love, more the concept. During four years of studenthood it fascinated me. Along with those other fundamental questions that any student must ponder (Who am I? What do I stand for? What's the longest I can sleep for? Has either Richard or Judy ever had an affair?), I spent much of my time trying to figure out who on earth watches this programme. It's a business and finance programme that's on in the middle of the day. Much as I love the idea of boardrooms and offices grinding to a halt while everyone settles down to be seduced by Chiles' flat, West Midlands tone, I find it unlikely. So, logically, the people watching must be the same as the rest of the daytime audience - pensioners, students and the unemployed. So, it's a programme about business and economics for the economically inactive! This, to me, seems to be akin to putting on children's television at midnight. In making such subjects as economics, business and finance accessible and interesting to the daytime audience, is Working Lunch an example of truly democratic programming, the embodiment of Reithianism? Or is it just really crap scheduling? I'm considering going back to university just to give me some more time to think about it."}, "isHosted": false}}}
