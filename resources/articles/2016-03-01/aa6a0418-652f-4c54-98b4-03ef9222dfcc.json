To recap: A grueling five-hour hearing revealed an unusual antipathy toward the Department of Justice in the usually FBI-friendly house of representatives judiciary committee. Lawmakers didn\u2019t merely accuse the FBI of undermining cybersecurity. Ranking committee member John Conyers attacked bureau director James Comey, saying that using the case of the iPhone belonging to the San Bernardino killer Syed Farook had undermined the remit of the legislature itself. \u201cCan you appreciate my frustration with what appears to be little more than an end-run around this committee?\u201d asked Congressman Conyers. California representative Zoe Lofgren, whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, called the quest to provide entry into encryption exclusively for law enforcement \u201ca fool\u2019s errand\u201d. Farook, with his wife Tashfeen Mailk, killed 14 people and wounded 22 in a shooting spree on 2 December, after which agents retrieved two destroyed cell phones, one useless laptop and Farook\u2019s locked iPhone. Apple has said it will not open the phone despite the government\u2019s acquisition of a court order under the 227-year-old All Writs Act by the Department of Justice attempting to compel the company to write a tool that will break its password security measures. Law-and-order conservatives including committee chairman Jim Sensenbrenner told Comey they supported his efforts, some invoking arguments ranging from Isis to the nuclear holocaust. Trey Gowdy told Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell he was unimpressed with the company\u2019s contributions to lawmaking and demanded the company draft a bill to address what he characterized as a technology problem. \u201cWe draft it and then your army of government relations folks opposes it, so I\u2019m just trying to save us time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you propose it? Tell us what you could agree to.\u201d For perhaps the first time, Comey summarized the Department of Justice\u2019s argument without the disingenuous claim that the San Bernardino case was limited in scope: \u201cIt\u2019s not [Apple\u2019s] job to watch out for public safety,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s our job.\u201d Sewell said that the company did want to help with public safety and said the company held the rights as a private citizen, among them its first amendment right to free speech and thirteenth amendment right to deny forced labor. The government\u2019s argument in the San Bernardino case \u201cmakes my blood boil,\u201d he told the committee. \u201cTo say that it\u2019s a marketing ploy, to say that it\u2019s about PR really diminishes a very serious conversation that should be about security of the American people.\u201d\u201d Susan Landau, a security expert who has worked with Google and the National Security Agency, offered perhaps the most daring take of the lengthy hearing: the FBI needs to get real about technology and start trying harder to break encryption. \u201cWhile the NSA has the right to break into a system, nobody ever guaranteed that it would be easy to do so,\u201d she says. \u201cThe FBI needs to take a page from the NSA.\u201d We\u2019ve written a summary of the full hearing; follow the Guardian technology section and national security editor Spencer Ackerman for more on the developing story. Landau, answering a question from Congresswoman Lofgren, says that everything is connected to the internet and treating it like it isn\u2019t will lead to trouble. The FBI is asking for login credentials, she says, which would set an especially dangerous precedent. \u201cWhether you\u2019re talking about the power grid, the water supply, whatever, we\u2019re connected in disastrously insecure ways and the best way to get in is login credentials,\u201d says Landau. Encryption, she said, was a serious problem. \u201cWhat law enforcement is asking for is going to preclude those strong solutions.\u201d \u201cDirector Comey said we\u2019ve talked to everyone who\u2019ll talk to us, but I was at an event held by the FCC, and some senior people from DOJ were there and I said \u2018Well NSA has skill X and skill Y\u2019 and they said \u2018They don\u2019t share them with us except in extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \u201cLaw enforcement don\u2019t have the skills and they need to develop them,\u201d she says. One of Sewell\u2019s better rhetorical flourishes is immediately undercut by Gowdy, who out-yells committee chairman Sensenbrenner. \u201cIs it right to make our society overall less safe in order to solve crime?\u201d Sewell asks softly; Gowdy immediately leaps in to demand \u201ca fact-pattern\u201d in which Gowdy would comply with the order. Sewell: \u201cCongressman, we will follow the law.\u201d Gowdy: \u201cI\u2019m asking you for a fact-pattern.\u201d Sewell: \u201cI don\u2019t, uh \u2013\u201d Gowdy: \u201cCan you give me a fact pattern where you would agree with what the bureau is asking you to do in California, whether it be nuclear weapons or a terrorist plot?\u201d Sewell: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine such a fact pattern.\u201d Gowdy: \u201cCan you submit legislation, to Chairman Sensenbrenner\u2019s question, that you would wholeheartedly support?\u201d Gowdy goes on to make one of the better points against Apple, which is that they already have quite a bit of influence congressionally and the legislature\u2019s inaction on encryption doesn\u2019t exactly have nothing to do with Apple\u2019s interests. \u201cWe draft it and then your army of government relations folks opposes it, so I\u2019m just trying to save us time. Why don\u2019t you propose it? Tell us what you could agree to.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re willing to and we\u2019ve offered to engage in this process,\u201d Sewell says. Congressman Lofgren, who represents Silicon Valley, is pretty contemptuous of Comey. \u201cIt\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be able to do what\u2019s being asked of us by the FBI.\u201d Again, strange bedfellows here: Ted Poe (again, a Texan Republican, and also a former judge) reiterates New York Democrat Jerrod Nadler\u2019s point earlier that there\u2019s a distinct possibility that Congress might simply tell Apple it can\u2019t have encryption of the type it wants. \u201cI actually agree with Mr Nadler; I know that\u2019s going to bother him a little bit.\u201d Sewell tells Nadler he believes ordering Apple to unlock the iPhone both violates both the first amendment to the US constitution and the thirteenth (which abolished slavery in 1865). \u201cThis is a compelled speech by the government for the purposes of the government which is absolutely a first amendment problem, and it is speech that Apple does not want to make,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it is conscription; forced labor.\u201d Darrell Issa makes a more utilitarian argument, echoing the point former FBI counterterrorism agent Mike German made earlier in this blog. \u201cHave you ever ordered a shredding company to put paper back together?\u201d he asks Vance. Vance has to concede. \u201cOf course I haven\u2019t.\u201d Republican Jim Sensenbrenner, chairman of the judiciary committee, yells at Sewell for not bringing a bill with him to Congress. \u201cWe have the iPhone of a dead terrorist!\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve come to us to ask us to do something, but you don\u2019t know what you want us to do.\u201d He theatrically yields his time in disgust, then Sewell tries to answer, then Sensenbrenner yells at him and yields his time again. It\u2019s less impressive the second time. \u201cI assume Apple will have legislative suggestions for us after the court makes its decision and Apple likes or Apple doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat from New York, says after Sensenbrenner yields for real. He, too, isn\u2019t happy with the one-device argument, and lights into Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance over it. Vance has said he has 175 iPhones waiting to be unlocked, but the number has now risen to 205. Thanks to reader Kevin Lee, who points out that Jerrold Nadler is from New York, not California, as previously stated Here\u2019s an interesting exchange highlighting one of the odd contours of the debate: there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about cryptography that seems to suggest that there\u2019s a difference between \u201cbreaking encryption,\u201d whatever that means (sharing super-secret prime numbers? Unclear.) and weakening the passcode so that it can be brute forced, as Comey describes below, in less than half an hour. Conyers gets at this asks by asking Sewell what the functional difference is between asking Apple to break its own encryption, and asking Apple to weaken the passcode protections. \u201cFunctionally there is no difference,\u201d Sewell says. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is an operating system in which the passcode is an inherent and integrated part of the decryption system. That passcode is a cryptographic key.\u201d So that\u2019s your cryptography 101 lesson: you participate in encryption on an incredibly sophisticated level every time you punch in your passcode. Back to the hearing: \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d go in that direction,\u201d Conyers replies. Sewell says that it is \u201cabsolutely false\u201d that Apple no longer works with law enforcement. \u201cThe relationship with law enforcement falls within my shop at Apple and I\u2019m incredibly proud of the work we do. We have dedicated individuals available around the clock.\u201d \u201cThis is not about the San Bernardino case,\u201d Sewell tells Conyers. \u201cThis is about the safety and security of every iPhone.\u201d It\u2019s probably safe to stop talking about the \u201cone device\u201d argument, made by Josh Earnest, among others, but Sewell kicks it one more time to make sure it\u2019s stopped moving permanently: \u201cThere\u2019s no distinction between a 5C and a 6 in this case. It is extensible, it is common, it is effectively the same.\u201d Goodlatte asks Sewell whether Comey\u2019s assertion that Apple\u2019s position is informed by its business model is \u201ca fair contrast\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s by no means a fair contrast, Mr Chairman,\u201d Sewell tells Goodlatte. He says he does not, in fact, agree with the characterization and says that hearing this described as a marketing issue \u201cmakes my blood boil\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this raised before. It was raised in New York, it was raised in San Bernardino. This is not a marketing issue, that\u2019s a way of demeaning our argument. We don\u2019t take out billboards for our security. We don\u2019t take out ads for our encryption. We\u2019re doing this because we think it\u2019s the right thing to do. To say that it\u2019s a marketing ploy to to say that it\u2019s about PR really diminishes a very serious conversation that should be about security of the American people.\u201d It\u2019s not quite true that Apple doesn\u2019t advertise based on its security, but it is true that Apple advertises its security as being non-annoying, rather than, say, so hard to break that you can sell drugs with impunity. Sewell goes on to cites Orenstein\u2019s decision from yesterday finding Apple \u201cconscientious,\u201d and says that in fact Apple is at war to improve public safety. \u201cWe see ourselves as being in an arms race with crminals, cyberterrorists and hackers,\u201d Sewell said. The second panel is finally up. Bruce Sewell, general counsel for Apple, reads the statement released yesterday, telling the committee that he \u201cappreciate[s] your invitation and the opportunity to a part of the conversation on this issue.\u201d Sewell doesn\u2019t say much to put Comey\u2019s mind at ease, given his earlier remarks on what Comey sees as Apple\u2019s attempt to usurp the FBI\u2019s remit. \u201cWe share their goal of creating a safer world,\u201d Sewell says, adding that the company cooperates often with law enforcement. Susan Landau, a former privacy analyst for Google, gives a very interesting testimony. Among other observations, she says that \u201csmartphones are increasingly wallets\u201d and points out that \u201cNSA will tell you that stealing login credentials is the easiest way into a system,\u201d a direct contradiction to the FBI\u2019s assertion that what it\u2019s asking is less harmful than to break encryption. Landau also quotes words of wisdom she attributes to a former NSA colleague: \u201cWhile the NSA has the right to break into a system, nobody ever guaranteed that it would be easy to do so,\u201d she says. \u201cThe FBI needs to take a page from the NSA.\u201d Finally, after three hours of condescending to the House of Representatives and being sniped at in return, FBI director James Comey is getting around to saying what he actually thinks about five minutes before he leaves the panel. Hakeem Jeffries from Queens presses Comey on whether the Department of Justice\u2019s characterization of Apple\u2019s position as driven entirely by marketing and PR was as contemptuous as it sounded to Jeffries. Comey responds that he thinks Apple\u2019s market power \u201cis not an illegitimate motive,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t like what they\u2019re selling, because it essentially privatizes law enforcement. \u201cIt\u2019s not their job to watch out for public safety,\u201d he says shortly. \u201cThat\u2019s our job.\u201d Comey also manages to state the opposition\u2019s case very succintly in pushing back on a question from Jeffries about breaking into the phone; he also identifies where he takes issue with it: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with your framing,\u201d he tells Jeffries. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re saying you either have privacy or you have unfettered access and I don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d Rhode Island democrat David Cicilline asks Comey if encryption law ought to come from the legislative branch rather than case law. \u201cDo you agree that the authority has to come from Congress?\u201d he asks. Comey, for perhaps the first time, gives a flat negative. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d Comey\u2019s case in a nutshell is that he does not want Apple to destroy its security and that the distinction is not a hairsplitting one. We\u2019re asking Apple to take the vicious guard dog away and let us pick the lock. Suzan DeIbene tells Comey that the tension is not between privacy and security but between security and security, Comey replies, \u201cYou\u2019ve said that very well, between privacy and security.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a technological problem - it\u2019s a business model problem,\u201d he said. Cedric Richmond, Democrat from Louisiana\u2019s second district, representing New Orleans, is present to discuss the case of a pregnant woman murdered by an unknown assailant; investigators have asked for access to her phone but have run up against encryption \u2013 she is believed to have kept a detailed diary on it. Comey has mentioned the case several times. \u201cWe balance public safety and criminal justice; are we in danger of creating an underground criminal sanctuary for some very disturbed people?\u201d Richmond asks Comey. \u201cUntil this, there was no closet in America, no safe in America, no bank in America that could not be entered with a judge\u2019s order. Until we drift to that place, we gotta talk about it.\u201d The case is not one that has been regularly mentioned up to this point; there is a case similar to the one described that was reported on in Louisiana last year. FBI director James Comey: \u201cThey\u2019ve set out to make a phone that they can\u2019t get into and they\u2019re darn near succeeding. I think with the 6 and beyond, they would have succeeded. That doesn\u2019t make them bad people.\u201d An interesting note from Comey: a brute force attack on the phone would take 26 minutes, were Apple\u2019s password-entry security measures defeated (again, see our explainer for a little more detail on how this works). And then Comey tells the committee he blames one man for his current predicament: Edward Snowden. \u201cSince Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations, terrorist tradecraft changed.\u201d Terrorists tried to \u201cwrap their lives in encryption,\u201d he says, and as a result, \u201cwe\u2019re looking for needles in a haystack, and the most important needles turn invisible.\u201d Steve King of Iowa brings up the Isis activity on Twitter, possibly, though his syntax is a little hard to decipher. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how the parameters that have been examined thoroughly by all the lawyers on this panel might apply to Isis, or any of their affiliates or subordinates that might be necessary if we\u2019re going to defeat that ideology.\u201d King\u2019s opinion appears to be that San Bernardino is small potatoes and that the American public ought to be more worried about \u201cradical Islam\u201d than even the constant discussion of Isis around Farook/Malik murders has made them. \u201cI think it\u2019s known that Isis or Isil are seeking a nuclear device,\u201d King tells Comey. \u201cIf that became part of the American consciousness, do you think that would change this debate?\u201d Comey does the thing he\u2019s done so beautifully during the FBI\u2019s messaging to the public, which is to plead for reasoned debate while reminding everybody that the FBI stands between them and anarchy. \u201cI do worry that it\u2019s hard to have nuanced complicated conversations like this in the wake of a disaster, which is why I think it\u2019s so important that we have this conversation now.\u201d The director also rejects the contention that the FBI already has the technology and just wants precedent. \u201cIf we could have done this quietly and privately, we would have done it.\u201d James Comey has a friend! Trey Gowdy, the mind behind the Benghazi hearings, says that \u201cI confess up front that my bias is toward public safety\u201d when it comes to the need to balance the various rights conferred by the US constitution. \u201cYou just can\u2019t go in these categories [of device] unless somebody consents, really?\u201d Gowdy asks, appalled. Comey agrees wholeheartedly with Gowdy\u2019s outrage. \u201cI love privacy too but I want my fellow citizens to understand that we also love our bodies,\u201d Gowdy says. \u201cIf you have a bullet from an officer who was shot in a defendant, you can go to a judge and ask the defendant to anesthetize a patient and remove a that bullet from the body.\u201d If that\u2019s not unreasonable search and seizure, the South Carolina Republican asks, what is? Gowdy is 100% wrong on this. The incident to which he appears to refer is a well-known Supreme Court case called Winston v Lee in which it was decided that the use of a previous high court decision, Schmerber v California, to mandate surgery to recover bullets against the will of a defendant was unreasonable search and seizure. \u201cThe proposed surgery would violate respondent\u2019s right to be secure in his person and the search would be \u2018unreasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d said the court. Comey no longer seems at ease; when quizzed on the nature of the Fourth Amendment (which secures Americans against unreasonable search and seizure) he continually says he\u2019s not a constitutional scholar, though he was district attorney for the southern district of New York. He then says that he thinks the framers of the constitution \u201cwouldn\u2019t have imagined any box or storage area or device that couldn\u2019t be entered.\u201d He\u2019s also clearly getting annoyed with the line of questioning. \u201cPeople keep asking \u2018Why didn\u2019t you come to Congress?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWell, because we\u2019re in the middle of a terrorism investigation. I think the courts will resolve this faster than any legislative body could.\u201d He further takes the opportunity of being criticized for seeking judicial redress when he ought to have come to Congress in the opinion of the committee to praise the judiciary. \u201cI have a number of friends who are magistrate judges, and they\u2019re awesome and they think well and they rule well.\u201d \u201cThe world I imagine is a world in which people comply with warrants,\u201d Comey says. \u201cHow they do it is up to them.\u201d We\u2019re back, and the committee has resumed queuing up around Room 2141 of the Rayburn House Office Building to spank the director of the FBI. Jason Chaffetz of Utah asks Comey when historically the government has been able to compel a company to create a product to help it. Comey says he doesn\u2019t know but cites one of the cases in the DoJ\u2019s brief, New York Telephone. Comey is fairly short with him. Chaffetz then tells Comey he thinks the FBI already overreaches to a serious extent. \u201cWe can\u2019t even see the degree to which you\u2019re using Stingrays, or the requirements [to use them].\u201d Chaffetz points out that the devices are apparently being supplied to the IRS without any congressional oversight. What is the occasion of their use, he asks. \u201cIs it articulable suspicion? Is it probable cause?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a great answer,\u201d Comey responds. \u201cI like the idea of giving as much transparency as possible.\u201d The Guardian has repeatedly attempted to use the Freedom of Information Act to acquire records on the use of Stingrays from law enforcement and the documents received have without exception been redacted to remove all mention of the device. While the hearing is on a break, perhaps it\u2019s time to consider the great New Yorker cartoonist David Sipress\u2019s take on the case: An amazing exchange between Texas Republican Ted Poe, whose accent occasionally vanishes as the jargon gets more and more technical and who at first blush does not appear to be repeatedly scolding Comey for trying to circumvent this committee. First, Poe asks how many encrypted phones the FBI has that it wants to break into. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Comey responds. \u201cA lot.\u201d \u201cCongress has to resolve this problem,\u201d Poe opines. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t leave it up to the judiciary to make this decision, and determine what the expectation of privacy is.\u201d Comey: \u201cI think that the courts are competent to resolve the narrow question about the scope of the All Writs Act, but this collision between public safety and privacy, the courts cannot resolve that.\u201d Poe: \u201cShould Congress resolve this issue of expectation of privacy of citizens? I\u2019m just asking you.\u201d Comey: \u201cI think Congress has a critical role to play and I think we\u2019re playing it today, I hope.\u201d Poe: \u201cI agree with you, I think Congress has to determine the expectation of privacy.\u201d FBI director James Comey, frustrated, insists the FBI works with clear and legal processes: \u201cThe FBI is not an alien force imposed on the American people from Mars\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe weighs in: Comey isn\u2019t making a strong case so far. Congressman Jerrod Nadler made the case that encryption software is widely available and that bad actors will just switch to non-US software if the US legislates, leaving the rest of us more vulnerable. Comey really hasn\u2019t provided a convincing answer to that yet. There\u2019s a lot of hostility in the room and Comey doesn\u2019t seem to have expected it. For starters, Jerrod Nadler isn\u2019t buying the idea that changing encryption standards will help prevent crime: \u201cSo with all the concomitant surrenders of privacy etc, the bad actors could easily get around it by making their own encryption systems?\u201d Comey says that \u201cthe big change here happened in the fall of 2014, when the companies switched from available encryption to default,\u201d and while he says \u201cthe companies,\u201d exactly one company did that, and the company was Apple. Committee member Darrell Issa is also borderline hostile - signaled earlier this week in his lengthy op-ed in Wired. \u201cDid you ask Apple for their source code?\u201d Comey says no, and that he doesn\u2019t understand the question (Issa probably should have said \u201cApple\u2019s encryption keys\u201d), Comey says he\u2019ll get back to Issa if he goes to his own people and Issa \u201chas said something that makes good sense to them\u201d. Zoe Lofgren is the next to pile on: \u201cBad cases make bad law,\u201d she says. Lofgren enters her own op-ed with Issa from the LA Times into the record. Comey says \u201cwe can\u2019t train our way around\u201d encryption, which is a fair point; PGP and other encrypted communications create very strong codes, although nothing is unbreakable, merely very difficult to break. In an interview with the Guardian, former FBI counterterrorism agent Michael German, who left the bureau in 2004 and now works for New York University think tank called the Brennan Center, said that \u201cevery investigation leaves evidence behind;\u201d the question becomes philosophical after a certain amount of evidence gathering. He also had a shining example from the San Bernardino case itself: \u201cIn the NBC coverage, NBC photographed a wastebasket full of shredded documents that the FBI left there! it would have been time-consuming and frustrating, but it was a small amount of material and it was the kind of shredder where it could have been put back together, but they left it there. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because the goal of an investigation is not to collect all data. The goal of an investigation is to prove the assumed facts true or false, and if you can\u2019t, you create a new theory and try to prove those assumed facts true or false.\u201d Steve Chabot wants to talk about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails instead of San Bernardino. Comey\u2019s first question, from Goodlatte, is on the FBI\u2019s use of the 227-year-old All Writs Act to compel Apple to write software in the San Bernardino case. Is it outdated? Comey has a pretty snappy response: \u201cThe constitution is older than the All Writs Act, and I think that\u2019s still a pretty useful document.\u201d Yesterday, New York magistrate James Orenstein said former didn\u2019t jibe with the latter in the FBI\u2019s interpretation and said the All Writs Act would itself be unconstitutional; Comey says he hasn\u2019t read the decision when quizzed on it. Comey is trying to thread a few difficult needles here; he has said repeatedly - including in an op-ed on beltway legal blog Lawfare - that the FBI isn\u2019t trying to set precedent in the San Bernardino case. When Steve Chabot asks him whether the FBI would take advantage of the precedent set, he says, \u201cSure, potentially!\u201d With respect to tech companies including Apple that the DoJ accused of putting marketing ahead of abused children, Comey says he \u201cdoesn\u2019t question their motives\u201d under questioning from Conyers. Conyers presses Comey on precedent: won\u2019t the FBI look for more cases to be resolved this way if the courts rule in the FBI\u2019s favor? \u201cIf the All Writs Act is available to us and the relief under the All Writs Act is available to us under the interpretation by the courts, then of course.\u201d And then Conyers says something that probably explains why House Judiciary seems so annoyed with Comey at the outset: \u201cCan you appreciate my frustration with what appears to be little more than an end-run around this committee?\u201d Comey says he cannot. Comey is up. He calls encryption \u201cthe hardest issue I have faced in government\u201d, says he worries that \u201cwe\u2019ve been talking past each other,\u201d and says \u201cthe problem of encryption [is what] the government calls \u2018going dark.\u2019\u201d He also says he says he hopes \u201cyou\u2019ll poke at me\u201d where you think it\u2019s unfair. For all his exhortation to keep the conversation dispassionate, Comey almost immediately invokes \u201cIsil\u2019s efforts to reach into this country and task people to kill people,\u201d tying it to the San Bernardino killings, which are generally believed to have been the work of people who were not under direct orders from anyone overseas. Our explainer on the issue\u2019s stakes for both the FBI and Apple is here. \u201cThe tools we use to keep you safe are becoming less and less effective.\u201d Comey sounds very frustrated. \u201cThe FBI is not an alien force imposed on the American people from Mars,\u201d he says. \u201cOur job is simply to tell people there is a problem.\u201d That problem, he says, is the increasing presence of spaces the bureau calls \u201cwarrant-proof.\u201d \u201cI want to associate myself with your comments about our jurisdiction,\u201d says Michigan representative John Conyers, amening Goodlatte\u2019s veiled suggestion that perhaps other unnamed committees with perhaps more of a military bent should mind their business. Encryption, Conyers says, protects us from \u201cthieves of all kinds.\u201d Goodlatte is a Republican and Conyers is a Democrat; the controversy over encryption seems to defy easy political categorization. Conyers also name-checks a Washington Post report from September that the government is seeking an opportunity to make its case in the most sympathetic possible way and has been since the Paris attacks. He also subtly dings the FBI for trying to attack encryption through case law, calling the house \u201cthe forum in which it belongs,\u201d as opposed to the courts, presumably. Welcome to our liveblog of one of the highest-stakes hearings in Congress so far this year: FBI director James Comey and Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell\u2019s testimony before the house judiciary committee. The admittedly boring title is The Encryption Tightrope: Balancing Americans\u2019 Security and Privacy, but it\u2019s still a popular one \u2013 Bob Goodlatte began the proceedings by asking the media to stop taking pictures of Comey. \u201cEncryption is a good thing,\u201d Goodlatte says, but it \u201cis not used as effectively today\u201d to protect people. Goodlatte name-checks a bunch of private-sector hacks, and makes a point of referring to Judiciary as the \u201ccommittee of exclusive jurisdiction\u201d on the topic. That means you, Intelligence. Comey\u2019s testimony went up very recently, though Sewell and others testifying, including Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan DA champing at the bit to unlock 175 iPhones, made theirs available yesterday. A representative sampling from Comey: \u201cThe more we as a society rely on electronic devices to communicate and store information, the more likely it is that information that was once found in filing cabinets, letters, and photo albums will now be stored only in electronic form.\u201d Goodlatte gives a brief summary of the Apple-DOJ case, and we\u2019re off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
