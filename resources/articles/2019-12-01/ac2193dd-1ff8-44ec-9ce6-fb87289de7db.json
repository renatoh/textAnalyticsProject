He inflicted a first defeat since September on his former club Sheffield United and their heaviest loss in 62 games. The victory elevated Newcastle to 11th, level on points with Arsenal and dizzying heights given his troubled start, and one of management\u2019s great survivors has outlasted Mauricio Pochettino, Unai Emery and Marco Silva this season. He first celebrated victory in a Bramall Lane dugout in 1998, simpler times that Chris Wilder harked back to as he bemoaned VAR\u2019s influence, in particular on Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s clinching goal. \u201cI started off as an apprentice at Southampton at 16, played over 400 games in a bang-average career and went into management at non-league,\u201d said the Sheffield United manager. \u201cI think I have managed close to 1,000 games and the game has changed. Every interview I do is VAR-led.\u201d All of which obscured the reality that awarding Shelvey\u2019s goal was correct. As Bruce said: \u201cUltimately, it was the right decision.\u201d Defenders have proved the best form of attack for Newcastle, scoring eight of their first 13 league goals. Not this time. The outstanding goalkeeper Martin Dubravka represented the finest form of defence. Newcastle\u2019s previously impotent attackers belatedly became productive. Allan Saint-Maximin opened his Newcastle account with what was, remarkably and ridiculously, their first league goal by a forward since Joelinton struck at Tottenham in August. Andy Carroll marked a surprise first start for his hometown club since 2010 with an assist. The other unexpected element was that Saint-Maximin, whose mesmeric, high-speed dribbling has made him a crowd favourite, delivered the sort of goal Carroll had copyrighted. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he would get a header at the far post,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIt is a classic trademark header.\u201d Saint-Maximin rose above the Geordie Chris Basham to meet Javier Manquillo\u2019s cross with the kind of towering header any totemic target man would be proud to claim. Carroll\u2019s was a curiosity of a performance. \u201cEveryone can see he needs games,\u201d Bruce said, \u201cbut I thought this would be right up his street.\u201d But because Carroll was utterly immobile, Newcastle lacked an outlet and were penned in. Yet, just as Bruce was about to bring on the more energetic Joelinton, Carroll helped secure victory. He won a won a flick-on and, for once, Newcastle had a runner from midfield. Shelvey surged into the space. Cue confusion. As the assistant referee Derek Eaton raised his flag the Blades froze. Only two men kept on running: Shelvey, who sidefooted past a motionless Dean Henderson, and the referee, Stuart Attwell, who tracked him more assiduously than any defender. \u201cEveryone in the ground stopped,\u201d Wilder noted. \u201cJonjo Shelvey even nonchalantly went up and took an opportunity.\u201d Yet Bruce\u2019s assistants, Steve Agnew and Stephen Clemence, were screaming at Shelvey to finish, which he duly did. \u201cWell done to the referee for not blowing his whistle and also to Jonjo,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThat was the directive at the start of the season: to play to the whistle.\u201d As replays proved, Carroll was fractionally onside while there were two defenders behind Shelvey. A harsh lesson for Henderson, perhaps. \u201cThe linesman needs to learn a lesson \u2013 to keep his flag down,\u201d Wilder said. If VAR is a regular source of complaint for him, a recent constant for Newcastle has been Dubravka\u2019s excellence. He maintained his magnificent form against Manchester City, showing athleticism and ability to keep out Enda Stevens\u2019 deflected shot, Ollie Norwood\u2019s curling free-kick and two close-range Oli McBurnie headers. Perhaps his best stop was irrelevant, as he blocked the offside Billy Sharp\u2019s diving header, but it was laudable nonetheless. \u201cOur goalkeeper has made a couple of world-class saves,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIt is not bad for us to have him in a rich vein of form but the spirit and attitude was terrific.\u201d It compensated for other failings as Newcastle had only 26% of the ball. \u201cThat is the most we have dominated any team in the Premier League for a possession point of view,\u201d Wilder said, \u201cbut they did a job on us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
