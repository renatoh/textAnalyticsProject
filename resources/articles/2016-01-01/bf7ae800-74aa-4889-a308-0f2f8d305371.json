She said of Nancy: \u201cShe\u2019s always, like, \u2018I\u2019m on chapter five, Daddy. How Your Life as Prime Minister Has Affected Me. Chapter two is when you left me in the pub.\u2019\u201d Superficially, it would appear that the Camerons run a household that acknowledges (or surrenders) to the idea that, when it comes to children, the age of deference is dead. The notion that parents know best \u2013 or, come to that, know anything at all \u2013 is not even up for negotiation. Children in some families are tailoring their own childhoods, technologically savvy, occasionally bumping into their double shift-working parents; like, whatever. Last week, however, in a major speech at the charity Family Action, David Cameron placed his parenting banner firmly in the territory now colonised by the fiercely competitive mother, American Amy Chua, triggering yet again a debate about which parenting style works best \u2013 and the tools families really require to give their children a decent start in life. Chua is the author of the controversial Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, published in 2011. In it, she detailed how she reared her daughters, Lulu and Sophia, now at Harvard and Stanford, to alpha levels. The regime included no sleepovers, no extracurricular activities, three hours of music practice a day, and Chua\u2019s constant eagerness to \u201cexcoriate, punish and shame\u201d. In short, motherhood operationalised as a full-time gruelling commando course. But is it good for children? In the US in the 1960s, psychologist Diana Baumrind named four types of parenting styles: authoritarian, authoritative, permissive and neglectful. She argued that the ultimate goal for children is for them to develop their own internal controls. What is needed in \u201cgood enough\u201d parenting, she argued, is not the imposition of a standard pattern but a recognition that every child is different and they vary in how they should be treated. The best outcomes, Baumrind said, came from authoritative parenting: caring, responsive and consistent. That\u2019s the ideal, says Adrienne Burgess of the Fatherhood Institute, but nobody gets it right all of the time. While inflexible, tiger mothering (or fathering), Burgess points out, is a form of authoritarian parenting, deemed one of the least successful ways to raise rounded children. \u201cIntensive parenting is a high-risk strategy,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no warmth, only negativity. A \u2018good\u2019 child may knuckle down, but another child won\u2019t.\u201d David Cameron seems to have conflated two different schools of thought around parenting to concoct his own \u201cTiger-lite\u201d approach. Last week he described Chua\u2019s approach more benignly than it is: \u201cWork, try hard, believe you can succeed, get up and try again.\u201d This reward for effort, not achievement, comes from the work of American academics such as Carol Dweck and Professor Martin Seligman and the latest developments in neuroscience around how parental involvement is crucial to building a baby\u2019s brain. The aim, however, is not to push children to the top at all costs \u2013 the Chua route \u2013 but to teach children that resilience and graft get you further than you thought possible. So why not give it a go? What Cameron may or may not understand about parenting styles matters because he has given the issue a central place in the Life Chances Strategy he launches in the spring, \u201csetting out a comprehensive plan to fight disadvantage and extend opportunity\u201d. The strategy replaces family income as a metric on poverty and instead takes into account parental behaviour such as unemployment and addiction. \u201cWe all have to work at it,\u201d the prime minister said of parenting. \u201cWhat about \u2026 when it comes to play, communication, behaviour and discipline? \u2026 Is it right that all of us get so little guidance? I believe we now need to think about how to make it normal \u2013 even aspirational \u2013 to attend parenting classes.\u201d In addition to parenting classes and vouchers, he announced proposals that include tackling mental health, demolishing sink estates and increased funding for relationship support. Crucially, he also seems to have abandoned the view of successive governments that pursuing policies seen to be interfering in the family is tricky. Cameron has a new adviser, Christian Guy, former director of the Centre for Social Justice. In a blog last year, Guy rightly wrote: \u201cWe are stuck in a culture of low ambition for the poor \u2026 A new approach would be rooted in the most successful poverty-fighting institution of them all: the family.\u201d Cameron echoed that thought last week. \u201cFamilies,\u201d he said, \u201care the best anti-poverty measure ever invented. They are welfare, education and counselling system all wrapped up into one.\u201d Penny Mansfield, of the relationship charity One Plus One, says that what Cameron says about family demonstrates an interesting political move. \u201cSuccessive governments have seen the family as the problem,\u201d she says. \u201cNow, Cameron is viewing the family as the solution. That\u2019s potentially a very important shift.\u201d In 1956 Sir Raymond Firth found that people, on average, could count 146 relatives in their \u201ckin universe\u201d; plenty to give a hand with holding the baby or offer a word of advice when a child turned into a hormonal, door-slamming teenager. Now the family support network has shrunk, sometimes, to a single parent and child. This is even as the knowledge about the importance of what we do as parents in shaping children\u2019s aspirations and non-cognitive \u201csoft skills\u201d, such as persistence, delayed gratification and self-discipline, expand. Cameron\u2019s references to character and resilience and parenting support delighted Baroness Claire Tyler, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on social mobility. However, the group\u2019s paper on parenting and social mobility published last year pointed out: \u201cThe present parenting support offer across the UK is fragmented, with little leadership from national government.\u201d Tyler adds a further warning: \u201cThe challenge with parenting courses is that, because of government policy over the years, it\u2019s too strongly associated with stigmatised groups and problem families.\u201d New Labour launched a national parenting strategy which rapidly became associated with punishment and compulsion. Cameron\u2019s \u201cnew thinking\u201d is to universalise parenting support. However, regardless of what style of child rearing you choose, family life does not happen in a vacuum. Last year the charity Family and Childcare Trust gave the government a D in its annual report card on family-friendly policies that include income, childcare, flexible employment and housing. Julia Margo, chief executive, says: \u201cParenting classes will make no difference at all if you can\u2019t afford to put a meal on the table for your family.\u201d A couple working full time on the minimum wage fell short of what they required in 2015 by \u00a375 a week. Research by Professor Kitty Stewart and Kerris Cooper of the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion at the LSE, drawn from 1988 to 2012, found that \u201cmore money directly improves the development and level of achievement of children \u2026 Conversely, reductions in family income \u2026 are likely to have wide-ranging effects.\u201d Stewart adds: \u201cIf income rises in low income households, maternal depression drops. We don\u2019t have knowledge about so many issues, but we do know that a decent income, affordable high-quality childcare, and a strong support system matter to life chances. Instead, all three are being damaged.\u201d A recent report says that disadvantaged families are the most likely to use children\u2019s centres, reduced by more than 750 since 2010, for offering parenting support. They liked, \u201cthe open-access, walk-in activities \u2026 because they did not feel there was a stigma attached\u201d. Parenting courses can and do work but, as critics point out, they are costly, and local authorities have empty coffers. Yet, given a decent income, childcare, housing and employment, most parents manage well. But without those foundations as a part of Cameron\u2019s Life Chances Strategy, there is a danger that the blame for staying glued to the bottom rungs of the ladder of opportunity will be unfairly attributed to a personal lack of moral fibre \u2013 and poor parenting. And that\u2019s not so much \u201cnew thinking\u201d as stepping back to Victorian times. Four styles of parenting 1) Authoritative Warm, communicative, demanding, responsive. These parents want their children to be assertive, self-regulated and socially responsible. They have freedom of expression, but clear boundaries. This style of parenting tends to produce rounded, competent adults. 2) Permissive Warm and accepting, lenient, avoiding confrontation, these parents try to be a friend to their child. Some overcompensate for what they lacked as a child, so they try too hard to give the freedom and material goods they lacked \u2013 or are so frazzled or occupied by work that they give material goods in exchange for a child not demanding time and interest. 3) Authoritarian Strict and controlling. A disciplinarian style that allows no negotiation, little autonomy for a child and no choice. Demanding of a child and not very responsive. Researchers say that, as a result, children tend to be timid, have low self-esteem and to rely to an unusual degree on the voice of authority. Then they may rebel. 4) Negligent/uninvolved These parents demand nothing and give nothing, so there is very little stimulus for a child, limited development and no boundaries. This might amount to physical and emotional cruelty. Parents have little understanding of what a child needs to flourish.
