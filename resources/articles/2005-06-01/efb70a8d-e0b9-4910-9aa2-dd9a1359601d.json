The semi-naked body of the woman, whose identity is a mystery, was found by walkers on Saturday afternoon near a footpath at a beauty spot in Snowdonia. She was wearing only tracksuit bottoms. Detectives said the body could have been in the undergrowth near the A4212 between Bala and Trawsfynydd in Gwynedd since Wednesday. A postmortem examination revealed multiple injuries to the head and upper body. She had been badly beaten but there was no evidence of sexual assault, police said. Detective Superintendent Chris Corcoran of North Wales police, who is leading the inquiry, said officers were trying to find out the woman's name. Police have launched a national appeal for information, believing that she was not local. The body does not match descriptions of anybody listed as missing from north Wales. The woman was described as white, 5ft 4in (163cm) and thought to be in her mid-40s. She had cropped bleached blond hair, brown eyes, and was of slim to medium build. The walkers, from Borth y Gest, near Porthmadog, were testing a new camera when they spotted a white shape in the grass. They described the find as \"shocking\". Anyone with information should call 01492 518383."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
