It was one of several policy options floated and it was dismissed as having \"no basis in law\". Best quote Sir William Patey on talk of \"regime change\" in Iraq in US in early 2001: \"We were aware of these drumbeats from Washington and internally we discussed it. Our policy was to stay away from that ... We didn't think Saddam was a good thing, and it would be great if he went but we didn't have an explicit policy for trying to get rid of him.\" Top jargon The NFZ operation.
