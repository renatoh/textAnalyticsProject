The news is a major disappointment for Stoke City as well as for Sam Allardyce, who may have to wait until November to give Butland the opportunity to press his claims for the England No1 spot. Butland, who fractured the ankle during the 3-2 friendly victory against Germany in Berlin a little under six months ago, underwent a scan on Wednesday that showed some scar tissue is still causing a problem, prompting a rethink regarding his return date. The 23-year-old is concerned that he could have to postpone his comeback from injury for up to another eight weeks, which would rule him out of at least half a dozen Premier League matches and the World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovenia next month. The picture should be clearer by early next week, when Butland is expected to receive another update on the injury, yet Stoke do not anticipate their first-choice goalkeeper will be available for a while. Their decision to sign Lee Grant on a short-term loan from Derby County on deadline day was made on the back of growing concerns about Butland\u2019s injury, with Shay Given currently deputising for the England international. Butland made his return from injury in a pre-season friendly against Burton Albion in July and looked set to start the season in goal for Stoke, only to break down in training the day before the opening Premier League game against Middlesbrough. Mark Hughes, the Stoke manager, admitted the injury \u201cknocked us sideways\u201d but suggested after the 1-1 draw at Middlesbrough that Butland would be out for only a couple of weeks. The latest development, however, suggests that Given, who has started all three Premier League games, will retain his place in goal for Stoke well into next month. The timing is far from ideal for all parties, including England. Joe Hart is short of match practice and a question mark hangs over him following his performances at Euro 2016. With his goalkeeping options already limited, Allardyce has been forced to call up Alex McCarthy after Fraser Forster, the Southampton goalkeeper, withdrew from the England squad for Sunday\u2019s World Cup qualifier in Slovakia. Butland has won four senior caps and is seen by many as England\u2019s long-term goalkeeper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
