In a letter to two institutional shareholders, Disney board presiding director George Mitchell said he had met with Mr Eisner in January to elicit his views on an eventual replacement. The board then met without him to continue the discussion, the letter said. Mr Eisner has been one of the longest serving chief executives on Wall Street. He was initially feted for breathing new life into the then struggling Disney in the 1980s. But the company has floundered for much of the past decade and its shares are now trading at levels last seen in 1996. Mr Eisner has been under particularly vicious attack from Roy Disney and his associate Stanley Gold, who both resigned from the company two months ago and have since been campaigning to have Mr Eisner removed. Their campaign was given added momentum two weeks ago when Mr Eisner failed to cement a new distribution deal with Pixar, the computer animation studio behind hits like Finding Nemo and Toy Story that has lent Disney much of its recent creative lustre as well as boosting it financially. Mr Micthell's letter was included in a filing with the US financial regulator, the securities and exchange commission. In it, he said succession had been considered and talked of in the past but that the process is now \"more formal and frequent, and extremely detailed\". Another meeting to discuss the issue has been scheduled for April, Mr Mitchell said. Disney and the two former directors are heading for a showdown at the company's annual meeting in Philadelphia next month. On Monday, Disney's board accused Mr Disney and Mr Gold of waging a \"misleading and distorted campaign\" against the company, saying they were putting their own interests ahead of the interests of shareholders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
