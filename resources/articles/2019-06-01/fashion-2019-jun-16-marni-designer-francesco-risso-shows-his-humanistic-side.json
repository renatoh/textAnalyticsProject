At the Marni spring/summer 2020 show on Saturday afternoon, creative director Francesco Risso had the audience stand shoulder to shoulder, rather than sit, under a suspended ceiling of backlit, disregarded plastic waste. His team at the Italian fashion house have spent months sourcing from industrial sources and the oceans. Imposing and strikingly beautiful, it was to reflect \u201cthe weight of this plastic that we\u2019re feeling right now\u201d, he told the press post-show. This being the first of \u201ctwo acts\u201d, the waste will be recycled into something new, in collaboration with the artist Judith Hopf, for \u201cact two\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a process where this nightmare becomes order on the second act, and it\u2019s going to be reworked by [Hopf]. I\u2019m making the nightmare, she\u2019s making the order.\u201d The collection was anything but a nightmare \u2013 on the contrary, it was a celebration. The marriage of Truman Capote and Ernesto \u2018Che\u2019 Guevara to be precise, and accordingly everyone had a party hat. Risso collaborated with the artist Shalva Nikvashvili \u2013 who used discarded furs, leathers and rubbish to make \u201cthe wedding hats\u201d which came stapled together. However, like many designers faced with scrutiny over supply and production chains, he is wary of coining it sustainable. \u201cI feel itchy when I hear the world sustainability, because no one can be sustainable one hundred per cent \u2013 even Greta Thunberg with her plastic yellow coat,\u201d he laughed. \u201cBut each little step is a change and that\u2019s why we are here standing together. It\u2019s about standing up [and] transforming what we have.\u201d Like Clare Waight Keller\u2019s headlining Givenchy show three days before him in Florence, Risso worked with opposing ideas to create this collection. It was \u201ca study in clashes, and the uneven harmony that ensues by mixing opposite worlds, jumbling it all together\u201d, read the show notes. Plaid patterns and block prints mingled in the artsy, haphazard way that has become Marni\u2019s calling card; suiting and trousers were split with contrasting fabric and hybrid waistlines; and the classic camo motifs that came on boilersuits, neckerchiefs and lacerated army jackets were jolted by an explosion of colour which Risso said was inspired by the Fauves. In his own words it was \u201ccamo versus carnival\u201d. Risso didn\u2019t want the takeaway to be political; \u201cit has nothing to do with politics,\u201d he insisted \u2013 preferring to frame it in a humanistic context, but it was hard to take away anything but. \u201cIt\u2019s more humanistic,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe wish politics was more involved with human rights and goodness but it\u2019s not, so it\u2019s us that has to take a stand. Everyone has to do it in their own steps and little by little.\u201d It was better for it. Fashion, and the Milan fashion week schedule particularly, has designers like this to thank for injecting relevance and integrity. This is a brand whose raison d\u2019etre has always been rooted in reality, a sartorial vehicle for offering commentary on pop culture, art and the world at large. It\u2019s a brand that attracts people who know the difference between great design and a gimmick and want to walk the walk, rather than just talk the talk. Risso, 36, who has designed womenswear and menswear for the OTB-owned house for three years to critical acclaim, is speaking for everyone who wants fashion to be intelligent and involved, and should be commended for not shying away from the conversation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
