At a hustings event for Tory members in Exeter on Friday, Johnson and Jeremy Hunt both appeared but were again questioned separately and did not debate with each other directly. One audience member asked Johnson if his refusal to go head to head with Hunt beyond taking part in two TV debates \u2013 one already gone and another due next month after many members will have already voted by post \u2013 meant he was running scared. Johnson rejected this, saying a gladiatorial contest between himself and Hunt could do harm. \u201cOne of the important things as Conservatives is not to spend too much time tearing great lumps out of each other in advance of the end of the contest. My policies and so on have received a huge amount of scrutiny,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing at least two head-to-head debates, which I think is probably more then enough to glut the appetite of the electorate. I\u2019ve done loads of debate in my time, loads and loads.\u201d Hunt said that while he was keen to avoid an overly brutal battle, he stood by his decision to term Johnson a \u201ccoward\u201d for avoiding head-to-head events. \u201cI have been asked about 1,000 times this week to make comments about Boris\u2019s personal life and I have rejected every single one. But we do need to have a debate on very important issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think we should have head-to-head debates and have these issues out, and I think we should have these debates before people cast their votes.\u201d Hunt stressed he would not challenge Johnson on personal issues in his life. \u201cWhen we are in a constitutional crisis, frankly the biggest constitutional crisis of my lifetime, it demeans that competition if we start having huge discussions about people\u2019s private lives. I think we should stick to the issue facing the country,\u201d he said. As he did at a hustings the previous evening in Bournemouth, Johnson refused to rule out proroguing the House of Commons to stop MPs potentially blocking a no-deal Brexit, but said he was \u201ccertainly not attracted\u201d to the idea. \u201cThere are all sorts of things that remain on the table, but it\u2019s a very big and capacious table,\u201d Johnson said. He was asked how he could unify the party when a number of Conservative MPs had promised to consider backing a formal no-confidence vote in his government if it pursued a no-deal Brexit, among them the junior culture and digital minister, Margot James. Johnson said that in the first series of leadership votes, among Tory MPs, he had attracted, \u201cmuch to the surprise of the pundits, the support of more than half of the parliamentary party\u201d. He added: \u201cOur team now has the backing of powerful, strong remain campaigners, as well as leavers. Dozens on either side. And they\u2019re coming together because they want to get this thing done and they want to help deliver that modern, Conservative, progressive agenda.\u201d In another part of the hustings, Johnson dismissed reports he had referred to the French as \u201cturds\u201d, saying: \u201cI have no recollection of this comment. It\u2019s not very well sourced, this story, but anyway.\u201d In a controlled, cautious performance, Johnson gave away very little that was new. Asked by the host, Iain Dale, to reveal something about himself people did not know, Johnson said he weighed 15 and a half stone (98.5kg). Polling indicates that while Johnson remains notably more popular than Hunt among Conservative voters, he has fallen behind with the wider electorate. YouGov found voters overall prefer Hunt to Johnson by 41% to 29%. Among self-declared Tory voters, Johnson still leads by 48% to Hunt\u2019s 39%. Hunt\u2019s net approval rating among all voters \u2013 the balance of those who believe he would do a good job in No 10 against those who think he would not \u2013 is -14, up from -24 a fortnight ago. For Johnson, the figure is -33, down from -18. Anthony Wells, YouGov\u2019s head of political research, said: \u201cIf the Conservatives are looking towards Boris Johnson as a magic election winner, the evidence is simply no longer there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
