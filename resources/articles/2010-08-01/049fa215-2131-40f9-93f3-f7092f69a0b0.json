London-listed miner Vedanta Resources saw more than \u00a3300m wiped off its market valuewhen India's environment ministry blocked its plans to mine aluminium ore in the state of Orissa, after a government inquiry found it would have destroyed the way of life of the Kutia and Dongria Kondh tribes. BP, whose share price and dividend have been hammered by the Gulf of Mexico spill, continues to pay the price for its tarnished reputation. It has just abandoned its hopes of winning an exploration licence in Greenland. Campaigners fear a new oil rush in the Arctic could result in another environmental disaster and the presence of BP would be, to say the least, tactless. But the UK oil major is not the only one with problems: Swedish oil giant Lundin is under investigation for alleged complicity in war crimes in the Sudan. Corporate behaviour will come under unprecedented scrutiny in the next few years as the world economy faces a cluster of huge and interlinked challenges, which we explore today in the Observer-Co-operative Asset Management Good Companies Guide. This scrutiny will not just fall on the usual suspects, the oil and mining companies that have always operated in environmentally challenging and unstable parts of the world, but on businesses across all sectors of the market, from banking to mobile phones and fashion. Big business will play a major role in shaping the future \u2013 environmentally, socially and economically \u2013 over the coming decades. In the boom years, overlords of finance including former Federal Reserve supremo Alan Greenspan argued that unfettered free markets and the profit motive would release billions of people from poverty around the world. The financial crisis has hurt the poor, but it has also accelerated the shift in global economic power from developed countries to emerging nations such as China and India. Most of the increase in the world's population will come in developing countries, adding to the pressure to distribute wealth and income more fairly. The strain on resources will become greater, possibly imposing an absolute ceiling on economic growth, just as a new global middle class in the emerging markets aspires to consumer goods and more luxurious lifestyles. The ways in which western corporations interact with the developing world will be key, both for their own fortunes and ours. In a benign future, resources will be sensibly husbanded, developing countries will become more prosperous and peaceful and new markets will open up for businesses. But if governments and companies fail to behave responsibly, the stage could be set for an environmental, social and economic dystopia. Nationalism and protectionism would increase, hampering world trade. We would be forced to live in a world scarred by hunger, deeper inequality, social unrest and war. Sustainability should be at the heart of business thinking. The view that maximising profit is the only thing that counts and everything else is window dressing has always been a crude and short-sighted approach. But in an age of globalisation and instant social media, the risks for a company if it is a bad corporate citizen are much greater. What happens in supplier companies on the other side of the world can be flashed on to customers' computer screens within seconds, leaving a reputation in shreds. Few, if any, industries can afford to ignore environmental, social or human rights issues. Take your mobile phone. It looks innocuous enough, but it might be implicated in the 12-year conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Campaign group Global Witness claims the Congolese army controls much of the trade in minerals used in phones, often using forced labour, and that their dealings with western companies help prolong the violence. Companies that flout concerns like these are increasingly vulnerable to public ire. Banks and hedge funds, which have already seen their reputations blackened by the credit crisis, are likely to face deeper questioning over their financing of environmentally questionable projects, such as Royal Bank of Scotland's backing for tar sands exploration. They will also be grilled on the impact of their behaviour on the world's poor. Investment bank Goldman Sachs, among its many alleged sins, also stands accused by the World Development Movement of profiting from commodity price speculation that has menaced the livelihoods of farmers in the developing world and pushed up prices for western consumers. Even well-loved high street names such as Marks &amp; Spencer, which has worked hard to help the environment through its \"Plan A\" sustainability programme, have been caught up in scandals: the retailer acted to stamp out sweatshop conditions after an investigation by this newspaper found staff at an Indian supplier were working up to 16 hours a day for as little as 26p an hour. Let's be clear: there is nothing bad about making a profit. But the best companies are those that do not see a conflict between profit and decency and aim to achieve sustainable earnings in the long term. The history of business is littered with examples of apparently soaring profits that turned out to be illusory, from the craters that opened in bank P&amp;L accounts in the financial crisis to the downfall of 1980s stock market darling Polly Peck, whose architect Asil Nadir has just returned to these shores. Let's also be clear: it is impossible for companies to behave like saints. Large businesses are complex, multifaceted organisations and few, if any, could claim to be beyond reproach. But it is not just the men and women running our largest companies who need to think more deeply about the need to balance profit and consumerism against the environment and human rights. We all do, as shoppers, pension fund members, employees and small investors. We blame business leaders for putting the planet at risk, for exploiting poor people in the developing world and for paying themselves too much, but most of us don't bother to act by voting at a company AGM, protesting to our pension fund trustee or checking on the supply chain of our T-shirts and gadgets. Companies can be a force for good. We must expect it of them and punish them if they are not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
