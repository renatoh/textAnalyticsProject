For large stretches of the match the Basque side outplayed the reigning European champions, and even though they squandered chance after chance they enjoyed a narrow lead with under twenty minutes to go. But a bullocking try from replacement No 8 Isitolo Maka and a cool drop goal from fly-half Yann Delaigue deep into injury time eventually won this gripping contest for Toulouse. Even so Biarritz could have won their first European semi-final had their scrum-half and star player Dimitri Yachvili not missed three kickable penalties - in contrast to Delaigue who effortlessly kicked three. The win leaves Toulouse still on course for a record third European Cup title. From the start both teams were guilty of giving away far too many penalties and committing basic handing errors as the tension of the occasion, played out in a bear-pit atmosphere before a capacity and passionate crowd, got to the players. Toulouse opened the scoring when Delaigue punished Biarritz with a penalty for off-side. After 18 minutes Yachvili made partial amends for an early miss when he made it 3-3 with a kick from 30 metres. However, after 23 minutes Biarritz lock David Couzinet found himself two yards off-side at a ruck inside his own 22 and Delaigue's simple kick put the champions back in front. Delaigue kicked another penalty to leave the champions 9-3 up at half-time, but the second half was dominated by Biarritz and their powerful pack. Yachvili finally managed to land a second penalty and then after 52 minutes came Biarritz's well-worked try. The new centre combination of Martin Gaitan and Thibault Lacroix found a way through the middle. For once Biarritz decided to move the ball wide and a simple pass from Nicolas Brusque put Philippe Bidab\u00e9 over in the corner, although Yachvili missed the tough conversion. The champions' response was brutal, as, led by Maka, they smashed back up the field. It was little surprise when Maka himself broke from a ruck and flattened Biarritz hooker Jean-Michel Gonzalez to score close to the posts. Delaigue's conversion put his side five points ahead. Despite Biarritz's desperate assault on their opponent's line, the champions held out with Delaigue's late drop goal ending the contest. It was tough luck on Biarritz, but Toulouse march on.
