A new attorney general here, a new UN ambassador there. All that legal stuff about his felonies in the 2016 election and \u201csynergy\u201d with the Russian government. What\u2019s a guy to do? Fire someone, obviously. If there\u2019s one thing Trump knows how to do, it\u2019s pretending like he knows how to wield power in front of the gawking media. It worked pretty well on The Apprentice, projecting the image of power on to the boss of a small-time real-estate business with multiple bankruptcies. But at this mid-life crisis stage of a catastrophically doomed presidency, there aren\u2019t that many people worth firing any more. So it came to pass that John Kelly found himself dumped on the Trump sidewalk of history, a throwaway tidbit of news in a dumpster fire of calamities. Trump\u2019s face-palming chief of staff was just another casualty of this president\u2019s dismal need to destroy the reputations of those who come too close. \u201cJohn Kelly will be leaving,\u201d he told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House before flying off to see the Army v Navy football game. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can say \u2018retiring\u2019,\u201d he explained, slamming the door into Kelly\u2019s back as he shoved him out of the West Wing. He couldn\u2019t say retiring and he couldn\u2019t say firing. Either way he said both, in passing, and without the man present to witness his own humiliation. Trump said his non-retiring chief of staff was \u201ca great guy\u201d but only managed to offer up this tepid testimonial to a former four-star marine general who was the most important staffer in his White House: \u201cHe\u2019s been with me almost two years now.\u201d As staff send-offs go, this was somewhere below a farewell cupcake but one notch above being frog-marched out. It seemed like a fitting end to a week in which Trump had finally reached the 15th time when he finally looked presidential. This week\u2019s episode in Trump Behaving Boringly featured a silent president sitting sullenly in the pews at the funeral for President George HW Bush. His claim to greatness was that he failed to projectile vomit through the proceedings, although at times it looked like he wanted to. Until now, the working hypothesis about Trump\u2019s constant media craving is that he\u2019s engaged in some sophisticated game of distraction. As Robert Mueller\u2019s investigations close in on the many criminal conspiracies surrounding his business affairs and the 2016 election, Trump needs to flash something bright and shiny to keep our attention away from his latest epic failure. However, Kelly\u2019s firing underscores a different motive. Trump is increasingly impotent with each passing week, with each new legal filing, with each new revelation of another former loyalist\u2019s betrayal. He just lost the House to his arch-enemies in a political landslide, and a new era of investigations is almost upon him. Within weeks the fickle media\u2019s attention will shift sharply to a sprawling cast of Democrats who want to push him out of the White House. If he can\u2019t stop the investigations, can\u2019t pass any legislation and can\u2019t yet run for re-election, all he can do is cling to the impression of power. Shuffling his staff is just another arrangement of deckchairs aboard an ocean liner already heading towards the sea floor. This explains Trump\u2019s strange morning habit of revisiting the scenes of his favorite firings and ritual humiliations. Like the home-made shrine of a serial killer, Trump\u2019s Twitter feed relives and repeats the moments of what feel to him like his greatest domination. On Saturday it was Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut senator, who dared to call Trump \u201can unindicted co-conspirator\u201d on national television. Trump responded by calling Blumenthal \u201cDa Nang Dick\u201d, an apparent reference to his Vietnam service at home in the Marine Corps. Never mind that both of them contrived to get five deferments from serving on the battlefield. On Sunday it was James Comey, the former FBI chief whom Trump fired for digging around all things Russian. \u201cLeakin\u2019 James Comey must have set a record for who lied the most to Congress in one day,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cHis Friday testimony was so untruthful! This whole deal is a Rigged Fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that I could not become President. They are now exposed!\u201d Self-awareness is not among the most obvious traits of Donald J Trump. His personal fixer just pleaded guilty to lying to Congress to protect Donald J Trump, while prosecutors described his criminal role in secretly paying off porn stars in terms that sound remarkably like a \u201cRigged Fraud\u201d. Unlike with Blumenthal and Comey, Trump has \u201cno plans to humiliate\u201d his chief of staff, according to Trump officials who obviously have no recollection of the many months of Trump\u2019s open musings about firing Kelly. In any case, Kelly \u2013 like so many others \u2013 has already humiliated himself by enabling an incompetent and autocratic president while pretending to restrain him. The self-made myths of Kelly and his delusional clan are that they were the last defense against Trump truly damaging the US and its national security. As if there were no damage from the deaths of thousands of Americans in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, or the forced separation of several hundred infants from their parents at the southern border, or the presidential sympathy for neo-Nazis, or the destruction of jobs in a futile trade war with China, or the weakening of alliances in pursuit of Vladimir Putin\u2019s approval. As far as we know, Kelly personally supported several of those approaches, especially draconian restrictions on immigration. Trump may have no current plans to humiliate Kelly but sooner or later he\u2019ll find he just can\u2019t help himself. He called his last secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, \u201cdumb as a rock\u201d and \u201clazy as hell\u201d. This from a president who doesn\u2019t read, spends his time tweeting about TV and just named a former Fox News anchor to be UN ambassador. You have been warned, John Kelly. Trump\u2019s mojo stopped working a long time ago, but he still thinks it works on you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
