It will, however, be a gathering with a difference. McLeish is the favourite to succeed Dick Advocaat as manager - or at least head coach - of Rangers, and who are Hibs' opponents tomorrow night? Why, Rangers of course. It is the pantomime season and nowhere more so than in Scottish football, where the two clubs have taken centre stage. But in contrast to Snow White or any other panto, no one is playing this for laughs after the news that the Ibrox club and Advocaat had agreed a new role for the Dutchman. They have decided the way forward is to have him in some form of technical director's job and have a top coach in charge of the first team. It has since become clear that McLeish is among the favourites for the latter position, with others such as Berti Vogts, Louis van Gaal and George Graham also mentioned. The only problem seems to be that no one has yet told Hibs of this master plan, and yesterday their managing director Rod Petrie insisted: \"There has been no approach from Rangers. Alex McLeish is under contract here and has three more years left.\" Petrie also said McLeish did not have a get-out clause, in his contract as some had believed. Rangers, meanwhile, for once kept their own counsel. So the speculation continues, although it seems inconceivable that McLeish will hold his pre-match conference today if there is any chance of him taking over at Ibrox before or just after tomorrow night's fixture. He would be something of a controversial appointment by the Rangers chairman David Murray. The former Aberdeen and Scotland defender managed Motherwell before moving to Edinburgh, but at both clubs he has enjoyed only fleeting success, admittedly with limited resources. He is regarded as one of the country's up and coming managers. In the past he has been tipped for clubs such as West Ham United and even as a successor to Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, although that would seem fanciful at this stage. There was also talk of him replacing Craig Brown as national manager. However, it would be a shock to Rangers fans if he were appointed. Supporters who have been increasingly restless over the past 18 months as Celtic have moved ahead would have been dreaming of a bigger name. Vogts might be acceptable. Van Gaal certainly would be, even if the prospect of another Dutchman would be greeted with dismay in some quarters. But Graham seems to be yesterday's man in his homeland. So perhaps by a process of elimination it all points to McLeish, who would certainly put the passion back into a club who have become soulless during Advocaat's 3-year tenure. Whatever, it is a crucial decision for Murray, whose own credibility would go on the line alongside that of McLeish as Rangers strive once more to become top dogs in Scotland - and perhaps beyond, if plans to play in the English Premiership ever come to pass."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
