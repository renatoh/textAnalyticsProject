It is an unusual strategy for Obama advisers, and specialists associated with the administration, to write en masse in such a way: an indication of the intensity with which the November election will be fought. The Obama foreign affairs advisers sent a lengthy letter to Foreign Policy magazine saying they wanted to put \"the record straight\" about the president's foreign policy record. They added that they wanted to know how Romney would diverge from Obama in his approach to Iran, Israel, military spending, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan and Russia. They concluded: \"We look forward to your responses on these specific issues.\" The letter is signed by 18 advisers, including Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, who said in December she planned to quit in February as under-secretary for defence and continue as an informal adviser to Obama, and retired general Wesley Clark. They were responding to a letter by Romney's advisers to the National Review the previous day that criticised at length Obama's foreign and military record. Although the Republican primary race has still to formally end, the White House and Romney are behaving as if it has concluded. The exchanges offer a taste of what to expect from now through to November. The White House response suits Romney, allowing him to present himself as the challenger to Obama, with Rick Santorum \u2013 his main rival \u2013 sidelined. The foreign policy spat was prompted by Obama's unguarded comments on Monday at a meeting with the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev in which the US president stated he could be more flexible on the awkward issue of European missile defence, which Russia opposes, once the election is over. In their letter, Romney's team challenged the Obama administration to say what else the president might be prepared to be flexible on. Obama advisers and sympathisers responded by describing the picture Romney's team presented of foreign policy as \"distorted\". They asked: \"We urge you to clarify exactly how and why you would depart from many of President Obama's policies\". Obama's team claimed al-Qaida's leadership has been decimated, Iran is weaker and more isolated, no president since Truman has done more for Israel's security, the war in Iraq is over, there is a clear strategy to end the war in Afghanistan, relations with Russia have been reset, the military supports budget cuts, and the easing of sanctions with Cuba are designed to undermine the Castro government. They then asked: \u2022 \"What specifically would you do to address the Iranian threat that is different from what President Obama is already doing?\" \u2022 \"You have said you would have left tens of thousands of US forces behind in Iraq. Would you have done so against the wishes of the Iraqi government and people, with no legal protections?\" \u2022 \"Why have you not outlined any policies to achieve US objectives and end the war in Afghanistan?\" \u2022 \"Given the clear successes of President Obama's counterterrorism policies, why and how would you change the current approach to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida?\" \u2022 \"Why did you call Russia 'without question our number one geopolitical foe', especially when strategic cooperation with Russia is essential for countering the Iranian nuclear threat?\" \u2022 \"Why do you continuously mischaracterise President Obama's support for Israel?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
