If these are available already, surely the day can't be far off when an entire, powered body suit gets here. And from there it's only a hop to the long-awaited exoskeleton. Impervious to projectiles or fire. My hydraulically enhanced grip able to snap bones as though they were chip shop forks. Raw, ravaging tendrils of blue-white energy tearing from my fingertips with a force to split men's chests. Then you'll all have to listen to me, won't you? Yes, then respect and fear will vie in your eyes whenever Iwalk past. And there'll be scores settled - don't imagine otherwise. Yes, Tony. Yes, Clive, Susan and Emma. Yes, mother. Yes, you first, mother: you first of all.\" Man, but you people worry me. These items from Volcanic Heat provide only warmth. (The heat isn't actually \"volcanic\". That would be excessive.) Obviously, they eat batteries: for an hour's use, the gloves require three AAAs each and the jacket six AAs. They do work; the problem is quality. Battery housings and connections are flimsy, and the seams on the gloves split after two days' skiing. So you'll need to climb K2 very gently. Self-heating electric mittens, \u00a319.99, and self-heating electric waistcoat, \u00a339.99, both from maplin.co.uk (0870 429 6000). gadgets@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
