Shah's compliance with level 4 of the code for sustainable homes goes some way to the provision of zero-carbon homes by 2016, which the Home Builders Federation is fully signed up to. However, I disagree with the assertion that \"the British public is being ripped off by the big housebuilding firms\". Homebuilders do not operate in a vacuum, but like Shah we are constrained by the planning system. The designation of his houses as \"holiday homes\" demonstrates the rules which developers have to navigate. Housebuilders across the country must also operate within the parameters of density targets and restrictions on land use. Recent reforms to the planning system should help to ease some of the problems, but the urgent need is for more land to be brought forward for development. Only with more land will we be able to provide sustainable, high-quality new homes on the scale required to solve our current housing crisis. Stewart Baseley Executive chairman, Home Builders Federation If Eddy Shah really is building decent-sized three and four bedroom houses for \u00a360,000 and selling them for up to \u00a3265,000, as your article suggests, then he is generating a truly alarming rate of profit, for which he should be ashamed. The reality, I suspect, is closer to the claim made by Shah in an article in Shelter's magazine, Roof: he could get the price down to \u00a360,000, but only by building two-bedroom flats, and only if VAT were to be waived. He may be, as he describes himself, a maverick, but the answer to the housing problem he is not. Peter Malpass Professor of housing and urban studies, University of the West of England Your reporter makes a dangerous statement when he says of going on to a building site: \"We don hard hats and reflective vests - to keep his site manager happy.\" It is exactly this attitude which limits the adoption of a safety culture across the industry. Visitors to sites are more at risk of accidents than site workers because they are in unfamiliar surroundings. Site managers have a responsibility to ensure the safety of people on site, but visitors should also be aware of the risks.
