The 39-year-old first started to feel ill when the smell of pesticides drifted from nearby Fresno county fruit orchards on a recent afternoon: \u201cWe experience this all the time. People get used to it.\u201d Rivera and other activists have been fighting for years to stop the spread of toxic chemicals in California\u2019s central valley, and they are hoping this kind of sickening drift will become less common following an unprecedented victory they won last month. California announced in May it was moving to ban chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that is linked to brain damage in children and is sprayed on almonds, citrus, cotton, grapes, walnuts and other major crops. The Golden State\u2019s prohibition is a stand against the Trump administration, which has supported continued use of the chemical. Central valley organizers are now pushing California to prevent hazardous materials from replacing chlorpyrifos. They\u2019re hoping their movement can be a blueprint for grassroots activists across the US of how coalitions can tackle environmental dangers \u2013 and the systems that enable their spread. \u201cThis is a lot bigger than banning chlorpyrifos,\u201d said Rivera, who is part of the Coalition Advocating for Pesticide Safety (Caps). \u201cWe have so much on the line, and we\u2019re tired \u2026 Children are being poisoned.\u201d \u2018Mothers led the way\u2019 Chlorpyrifos, introduced in 1965, is very effective at treating pest infestations, but can have serious consequences for unintended targets. The neurotoxic chemical was found to be harmful enough to humans that the US government banned it from residential use in 2000. But its widespread usage in the agricultural industry continued in California, where a majority of America\u2019s fruits and nuts are grown and where regulators have long defended its safety. Studies, however, increasingly raised doubts. Pregnant women who lived near farms that sprayed chlorpyrifos had increased risks of having a child with autism, University of California, Davis researchers found. Other studies showed that low to moderate levels of exposure during pregnancy were tied to memory problems and lower IQs. Chlorpyrifos was also linked to reduced breathing capacity. \u201cResearchers were studying real families in California and identifying real problems caused by exposure \u2026 and yet it has been on the market all this time,\u201d said Caroline Cox, senior scientist at the Center for Environmental Health. \u201cChildren are going to be dealing with these things for the rest of their lives.\u201d Under the Obama administration, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed an agricultural ban on chlorpyrifos based on this research. But Trump\u2019s EPA denied the conclusions of the agency\u2019s own experts and rejected the ban, claiming it was \u201creturning to using sound science in decision-making\u201d. In California, where Latinx schoolchildren have been disproportionately exposed to heavy pesticide use, growers have continued to apply nearly a million pounds of chlorpyrifos each year. Despite the state\u2019s reputation as the progressive leader of the resistance to Trump, local regulators continued to permit the chemical. In response, Caps and other rural activist groups escalated their protests and testimony at government hearings, demanding California intervene. \u201cWe spoke up. We shared our stories about the impact that chlorpyrifos was having on our health,\u201d said Fidelia Morales, a 46-year-old mother in Lindsay, a farming town three hours north of Los Angeles. Morales, who lives near citrus groves where chlorpyrifos use is common, said pesticide exposure has hurt her family, especially her 11-year-old son: \u201cMy son is not able to stay still and listen in school. I\u2019ve had to sit with him in the classroom to help with his assignments.\u201d The mother of five moved to the area about 12 years ago, and quickly became concerned about pesticides drifting onto her property. \u201cBut I did not really know how dangerous the chemicals were.\u201d She eventually learned of the troubling science. \u201cOnce they make that connection, it\u2019s really angering,\u201d said Rivera, whose father was an activist with the United Farm Workers (UFW) labor union. \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating, because they are being told there is not an alternative, or the alternative is too expensive. How do you say that to somebody when it\u2019s their child\u2019s life?\u201d Central Valley residents traveled to the state capitol and testified about drifts causing vomiting and debilitating headaches, and their fears about long-term impacts on children. \u201cMothers are always leading the way, and you don\u2019t mess with a mom,\u201d said Rivera. When pesticides drift into homes, parents feel helpless and afraid, sometimes fearing their children won\u2019t be able to breathe or won\u2019t wake up the next morning, said Raul Garcia, a 22-year-old activist with Caps, who previously worked in the dairy fields. \u201cThe work is so hard, and the wages are so low, and our health is so poor,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are working in the hot sun just to barely make it through, then at night they are worried about their children\u2019s health, but they gotta be up again at 4am to go to work.\u201d When it came to chlorpyrifos, which had yielded so much damning research, activists worked hard to make it untenable for California to deflect any further, bringing up the difficult-to-pronounce chemical at town halls across the state. \u201cThe public concern meant policymakers were being asked a lot of questions and were really unable to just ignore the science, or set the chemical aside,\u201d said Dr Gina Solomon, a former California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) deputy secretary and clinical professor of medicine. Angel Garcia, chair of Caps, said the chlorpyrifos campaign was effective because it united groups with a diverse range of interests, from immigrants\u2019 rights, voting rights, labor activism, reproductive justice and more: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be transformative, we\u2019ve got to all come together.\u201d In May, the governor, Gavin Newsom, and CalEPA announced that they had listened to residents and that a ban was \u201cneeded to prevent the significant harm this pesticide causes children, farm workers and vulnerable communities\u201d. The state cited recent findings of serious health effects at even lower exposure levels than previously understood. Stunned activists celebrated the decision across the state. \u201cMy children can be outside and play and be safe,\u201d said Morales. But there was a catch. The governor was not announcing an immediate ban, but rather the start of a \u201ccancellation process\u201d to introduce the restrictions in phases. It could take up to two years. There were also no guarantees about the safety of products that would replace it. \u2018We\u2019re not going to stop at chlorpyrifos\u2019 The governor\u2019s chlorpyrifos announcement said he also plans to invest $5.7m in new funding to support the \u201ctransition to safer, more sustainable alternatives\u201d. Still, \u201ccommunities are not yet at ease\u201d, said Garcia. There is fear from some that the ban could make little difference. \u201cWill chlorpyrifos be replaced by something nearly as hazardous? Or will California really pivot to a more sophisticated plan for sustainable pest management?\u201d said Paul Towers, executive director of the Community Alliance with Family Farmers, adding that the broader regulatory system needed to improve: \u201cWe can\u2019t spend decades fighting each individual chemical.\u201d The state has promised to partner with growers to seek out practical alternatives that don\u2019t rely on toxic chemicals, such as integrated pest management practices and biological controls. Val Dolcini, acting director for the department of pesticide regulation, said the state was not enacting an immediate ban so that it had time to prevent growers from switching to harmful products: \u201cThe department has made it clear to growers in California that they should begin to seek less harmful alternatives and less toxic pesticides.\u201d Corteva Agriscience, the chlorpyrifos manufacturer, has continued to defend its product, saying a ban would \u201cremove an important tool for farmers and undermines the highly effective system for regulating pesticides that has been in place at the federal level and in the state of California for decades\u201d. The company, previously part of agrochemical corporation DowDuPont, said it was \u201cevaluating all options to challenge\u201d the state\u2019s restrictions and declined to comment further this month. Morales said she was sick of the manufacturer\u2019s defenses and wanted the company to know that residents would not back down: \u201cStop lying to the community.\u201d There are also regular reminders that the chlorpyrifos win is, by some measures, only a small victory. Angel Garcia said last week he was called to a local Tulare county vineyard where dozens of workers had suffered from a direct pesticide exposure from a nearby drift, some vomiting and others experiencing dizziness and headaches. \u201cThey know this was wrong,\u201d he said. Raul Garcia said the ban on one chemical was only the beginning: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop at chlorpyrifos. We\u2019re just getting started.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
