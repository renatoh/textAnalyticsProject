He is talking to Mac Jago, a worker at Cement Australia, one of the north-west\u2019s big employers. The pair sink a couple of Boag\u2019s ales, and make small talk. \u201cWe had a pretty decent chat, normal stuff, as you do,\u201d Jago tells Guardian Australia. \u201cFooty, my girlfriend, his missus. He seemed like not a bad bloke.\u201d Morrison is on the offensive, campaigning in the Labor-held seat of Braddon, one of a clutch of marginal seats the government hopes it can wrest back at the 18 May election. It is a sign of his confidence, or at least his belief, that the Coalition can cling on to government. A few months ago, the prospect of the Coalition hanging on to power seemed an absurdity, but now strategists on both sides are gearing up for a fierce contest. However, it\u2019s still early days in the campaign. Ultimate compromise candidate Morrison\u2019s first order of business once he assumed the role of leader last August was to patch up a bruised and battered party. Leadership tensions have plagued the Liberals for a decade as the party swung from moderate Malcolm Turnbull to conservative Tony Abbott and back again, running the gamut of the Liberals\u2019 extreme left and right flanks. Morrison managed to emerge through the centre of the party as the ultimate compromise candidate \u2013 moderate MPs joined Morrison\u2019s centre-right faction to block conservative warrior Peter Dutton from taking the role. \u201cThe good thing about Scott is he is able to walk through the middle,\u201d one MP who supported Dutton says. \u201cWe needed someone to heal our party and he could do that. He studied at the altar of John Howard and he understands he has got to lead the team and he has got to inspire.\u201d Morrison\u2019s capacity to work across the factional divide has allowed him to steady the ship. Immediately after the leadership change, the polls showed Labor had consolidated its position, ahead 56%-44% two-party-preferred. It appeared unassailable. Morale among Coalition MPs was at rock bottom. Colleagues are reluctant to put their name to either praise or criticism of Morrison during the election campaign, but one Liberal called his work since taking over as leader \u201cmiraculous\u201d. \u201cThe party was in rack and ruin and he has had to put it back together with his bare hands. \u201cPeople are quite surprised to believe that the ship might float again. People can just form a victory narrative \u2013 just \u2013 it is just enough to believe in it.\u201d Others say the Liberal party is more united than it has been since John Howard\u2019s days, playing down the backlash from voters about the coup culture that has gripped Canberra for more than a decade. \u201cI honestly believe that we are in a much better position as a result of the change of leadership, because of who Morrison is, how he relates to people.\u201d As a creature of the NSW Liberal party \u2013 he was state director from 2000 to 2004 \u2013 Morrison\u2019s political career has been forged in the fire of factional warfare. The manner of his preselection for the seat of Cook still stokes fury within the party\u2019s conservative wing, more than a decade on, after its candidate Michael Towke was brutally knocked off following a series of damaging stories in Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph, despite initially winning by 82 votes to eight. Party figures remember when an \u201cindexed shit file\u201d on Towke, prepared by Labor\u2019s Sam Dastyari, was wheeled into a meeting of the state executive on a removalist trolley. Dastyari has revealed that he handed over the material to \u201cMorrison\u2019s factional lieutenants\u201d at the Golden Century Chinese restaurant on Sussex Street in Sydney. \u201cI would never underestimate Scott Morrison because I would never underestimate a guy who would turn to one of his political opponents to take out one of his own ... a guy who will do that will do anything,\u201d Dastyari told Sydney radio last year. The factional dealing in the NSW branch of the party has made enemies for Morrison\u2019s centre-right faction, and particularly his close ally Alex Hawke. One party figure derides them as the \u201crent by the hour\u201d faction, because they will do deals with anyone. But the middle way has proved successful for Morrison. The centre right is a small faction, but has been able to position itself as the fulcrum of power, switching as needed from the left to the right and vice-versa to yield results. That dynamic was at play to install Morrison as leader, with six crucial votes \u2013 MPs Lucy Wicks, Stuart Robert, Ben Morton, Hawke, Steve Irons and Bert van Manen \u2013 ultimately deciding the leadership. \u201cScott Morrison is one of the few people who could follow you into a revolving door and come out first,\u201d one senior NSW Liberal moderate says. \u201cHe is a master of the middle and he has the capacity to do these crab-like pincer movements to shimmy his way into the right place at the right time. It is quite impressive.\u201d Morrison emerged victorious last August after conservatives in the party put the wheels in motion to end Turnbull\u2019s leadership. Once the moderates realised Turnbull\u2019s time was up, they worked assiduously with Morrison\u2019s faction to cruel any chance of a Dutton victory. But it was the shrewd operators of Morrison\u2019s faction, led by Hawke, who sealed Turnbull\u2019s fate by bringing on the leadership spill in the first place. Loyalists to Morrison dismiss suggestions that this was a calculated Morrison-for-PM project, saying that in a contest between Turnbull and Dutton, some of his people preferred Dutton \u2013 no big deal. But after the judgment had been made to remove Turnbull \u2013 whom Morrison embraced as \u201cmy leader\u201d amid the crisis \u2013 the machinations allowed Morrison to take the top job without the baggage of being the instigator. Some conservatives in the party outflanked by Morrison remain livid at what they see as the prime minister\u2019s double dealing, claiming he had been positioning himself \u201cfor years\u201d for the job. \u201cHe has tried to give the impression this all fell into his lap, but that is crap,\u201d one senior conservative MP says. \u201cAnyone who knows anything about what happened knows that is not the case. This was careful, it was planned, it was clinical.\u201d A natural politician? Morrison understands intimately factional power play. When state director, he took the unusual step of appointing two deputies \u2013 the head of the right and the head of the left faction. His supporters say this is a sign of his political nous. \u201cA leader must understand that you can\u2019t have victory for one side \u2013 victory for one side means defeat for the party \u2013 Scott knows that in his bones,\u201d one MP says. But this willingness to do deals, to compromise, has also made Morrison appear something of a political chameleon; someone notoriously hard to pin down. The right highlights his position on same-sex marriage to make this point. While Morrison is an evangelical Christian and opposed to same-sex marriage, he chose to work on protecting religious freedoms in the enabling legislation rather than \u201cgetting out there and fighting it\u201d. \u201cHe knew that if he became a warrior in the marriage case it would cruel his chances of attracting left votes. So what is Scott Morrison prepared to compromise for? He is prepared to compromise for political ambition.\u201d Others are even harsher, saying Morrison is ambitious, aggressive and intemperate, and hasmanoeuvred himself into the top job by getting Hawke and others to do his dirty work. \u201cHe is the be-all, end-all know it all.\u201d His supporters dismiss the criticism, saying some colleagues dislike him because he doesn\u2019t buy into \u201cinternal factional political crap.\u201d \u201cThey [conservatives] dislike him because he has been a loyal servant of the party who has never put an internal factional fight above the best interests of the party as a whole and the nation,\u201d one MP says. \u201cHe is centrist, he is a mainstream Liberal, and he cares about the values that he has articulated in this campaign. He is not a warrior, he is not a spear carrier.\u201d Many see Morrison as a natural politician. He is a hard worker and has successfully tackled substantial areas of reform: he was the architect of the controversial Operation Sovereign Borders policy, and has made significant changes in thornier policy areas such as welfare reform, the GST and superannuation. But his critics find him smug and arrogant. \u201cI think when he is in full flight and he knows what\u2019s best, he can be very abrasive \u2013 how he handles that could probably improve,\u201d one MP says. Morrison may have mastered the middle of his party and tamed internal dissent, but is he the right man to win back middle Australia, the fabled Howard battlers? Soon after becoming leader, Morrison told the party room he had been chosen to lead, and he expected MPs to follow him. The election campaign has begun with Morrison closing in on Bill Shorten and unsettling the Labor leader, who still remains the firm favourite to win next month\u2019s poll. In the first week of the campaign, Morrison has proved himself to be a formidable contender, and even his detractors within the party \u2013 from the Dutton and Turnbull camps \u2013 acknowledge he is doing well to connect with middle Australians. With tax cuts to sell and Labor\u2019s sweeping policy platform to target, Morrison is needling Labor strategists, who know they are up against a wily operator. There has been a shift in the dynamic \u2013 Labor and Shorten have come under pressure for the first time in a long time. \u201cScott has wrong-footed Bill more times than I have had hot breakfasts in the past six months,\u201d one MP says. \u201cHe is agile, and he can see around corners and he gets the politics of everything.\u201d But MPs, however hopeful, need the polls to tighten further before getting too carried away. It is a long road ahead. The Coalition starts from behind. It needs to win seats to maintain the status quo and is dealing with spot fires in seats such as Wentworth, Warringah, Kooyong and Farrer that will divert resources needed in marginal seats. Unlike in 2016, Morrison is helped by the weight of expectations resting firmly on Labor. Scrutiny is focused on the government in waiting, rather than the current government, which has shed itself of the unpopular corporate tax cut policy it took to the last election. But this is still Shorten\u2019s election to lose. \u2018A bit of an inbetweener\u2019 Morrison\u2019s pitch to middle Australia is centred on his own suburban Australian story. He speaks fondly of his childhood in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs, where his parents, John and Marion, ran the Boys and Girls Brigade at the local church. His father was a policeman and mayor of Waverley Council, exposing Morrison to politics from a young age. Morrison won a place at the academically selective Sydney Boys high school, where he had a close-knit group of friends that he still socialises with more than 30 years later. A trawl of his old school yearbooks shows he was into sport and music. In his second year at the school in 1982, he was cast as the Artful Dodger in a production of Oliver! The role of a skilful and cunning pickpocket was relished by the eager young Morrison, who also played the saxophone in the school concert band and orchestra. His musical interests soon gave way to sport, with Morrison progressing steadily up the ranks to be in the school\u2019s rowing 1st VIII and rugby 1st XV by year 12. As a 15-year-old, he was affectionately teased as \u201cciggies\u201d because of his skinny legs. His rowing mates wrote one year that he was a \u201crabble-rousing schizophrenic\u201d with a \u201csound style and a nice singlet\u201d. When profiling himself as the captain of his year 10 rowing four, Morrison said he was \u201cknown for his psyche-up sessions and aggravating coaching suggestions. He was \u201cthe brains of the crew, plotting the race strategies\u201d. A rugby teammate from the time, Christian Rabatsch, says Morrison was \u201ca bit of an inbetweener\u201d at school. Academically solid, but not a standout. \u201cThere were some people in our year who stood out and you thought, \u201cthey have got something special\u201d, but that wasn\u2019t him,\u201d Rabatsch tells Guardian Australia. \u201cYou get some kids who have got a strong personality, who were really out there, you knew they were in the room \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say Scott was like that. He just put his head down and worked hard \u2026 he floated under the radar and just did his thing.\u201d Scott Mason, a good schoolmate of Morrison\u2019s, says he was a \u201cpopular, fun, and funny\u201d teenager, who became more serious once he met his wife-to-be, Jenny, while still at school. But he says no one would have expected him to become prime minister. He wasn\u2019t on the debating team, he wasn\u2019t interested in studying politics or law. \u201cWe were all amazed where he ended up,\u201d Mason says. When they catch up as adults, politics is not on the agenda. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, we are a reminder of his fun teenage youth, he much prefers to talk to us about what we are doing, our families, that sort of stuff.\u201d Morrison lists his family and faith as the most significant influences on his life. He is a Pentecostal Christian and has credited senior Hillsong pastors as being among his most important mentors. But he is private about his faith, telling parliament in his first speech: \u201cMy personal faith in Jesus Christ is not a political agenda.\u201d His instincts on this are again political \u2013 he knows that Australians don\u2019t like people forcing their religious views on others. \u201cSuper normal\u201d, is how one MP describes Morrison. His home life in Sydney\u2019s shire is like something out of Australia\u2019s first reality TV series, Sylvania Waters. \u201cIt is blokes sitting around drinking beer and talking about footy. That is what he loves.\u201d Peter Verwer, a former head of the Property Council who was a mentor of Morrison\u2019s before he entered politics, says the prime minister has \u201ccontinued as he began\u201d after he made the transition from the corporate sector to politics. \u201cHis great virtue is his no-fuss approach and he was very quick to grasp all the dimensions of an issue. I think he is a very rare individual, he is good at both strategy and tactics; he sees the long arc of an issue, but is willing to calibrate those views in order to deal with the reality of circumstances. \u201cHe instinctively understands the aspirations of middle Australians, because he is one of them. There is no need to play it as a game \u2013 this is his nature.\u201d After becoming leader, Morrison told the party room he had always been a fan of rowing. His favourite bit of the race was the final 500 metres. His old rowing buddy, Mason, says Morrison will want to make sure he leaves \u201cno question unanswered\u201d in the final run-up to 18 May. \u201cThe last 500 metres is the sprint to the finish, it is when you leave nothing on the table. You want to finish with nothing left in the tank \u2013 you completely drain yourself and you have nothing left at the finish.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
