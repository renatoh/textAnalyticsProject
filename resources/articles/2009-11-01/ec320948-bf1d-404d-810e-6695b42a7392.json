Sussex, who have signed the troubled England spin bowler from Northamptonshire on a three-year contract, are in no hurry to disagree. \"I think all that is largely true,\" said Sussex's cricket manager, Mark Robinson, today. \"But in the cycle of any player, however talented, you hit a wall. Monty has hit that wall. He had a great start to his career \u2013 he was metronomic \u2013 and now he has lost his way a little. He has to remember that he plays the game because he loves it and Sussex intend to help him remember that.\" Robinson, who will coach England Under-19s in the World Cup in New Zealand early next year, believes Panesar's switch to Sussex will give him a great opportunity for consistent advice because of the presence of Mushtaq Ahmed. Mushtaq, who was the leading championship wicket-taker four years in a row and inspired Sussex to three championship titles, is now a part-time spin bowling coach for both England and Sussex, and the county still looks after his family while he is in England. \"I'm sure that the opportunity to work with Mushy had a lot of influence on Monty's decision,\" Robinson said. \"He will give Monty support and continuity. It is up to Sussex, our coaches, our players and our fans, to create an environment where Monty feels lots of love and affection and his talents are valued. \"I am very excited about the prospect of Monty joining us from 2010. I am sure he will play a key part in helping us achieve our aims for the coming season.\" Panesar briefly became a national hero in the summer when he took part in a stubborn last-wicket stand with Jimmy Anderson to save the first Ashes Test in Cardiff. But he had a demoralising time with the ball, taking only 18 championship wickets at an average of nearly 60. When he lost his England central contract, he became a financial risk that Northants, one of the poorer counties on the first-class circuit, could ill afford. Northants have denied reports that Panesar suffered from a lack of sympathy at the hands of their South African contingent but the impression will not disappear so easily. David Capel, Northants' head coach, has always been a loyal ally. He said: \"I have worked with Monty since he was 16 and I have really enjoyed seeing his rise from determined youngster with potential to becoming a full England representative. \"I am sad that Monty is moving on. However, as a coach and a supporter of English cricket I am sure that a move at this stage of his career is the right thing for him. Everyone at Northants looks forward to seeing him regain his England place.\" Panesar's insistent, attritional method \u2013 quick for a spinner, immensely accurate, with some turn and limited flight \u2013 brought him 73 wickets in his first 20 Tests. But he was persistently accused of being unimaginative, as he failed to win Tests in the fourth innings on helpful surfaces, and attempts to add more flight and variety to his game have brought disastrous results. Sussex's challenge will be to clear his mind and remind him of his worth. Panesar was speechless when confirmation of his transfer broke. He was said to have a minor throat infection, which was likely to make him unavailable for interview for 24 hours, but he said in a statement: \"I am extremely grateful to Northamptonshire for allowing me to make this move. I am really looking forward to helping Sussex reclaim its Division One Championship status and maintain their premier position in the shorter forms of the game. \"Success in this new challenge with Sussex can only improve my chances of reclaiming my place in the England standings, which is the pinnacle for any player.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
