While parliament\u2019s bipartisan intelligence committee is yet to report on the government\u2019s bill, Guardian Australia has learned that opposition members are pushing back at a change that leaves it up to the attorney general alone to approve intrusive questioning. Asio can now use compulsory questioning powers to gather terrorism-related intelligence, but the draft legislation would expand the scope to cover the broader categories of espionage, foreign interference and politically motivated violence. The bill would enable the attorney general to approve questioning warrants directly without the involvement of a judge \u2013 an easing of the hurdles the agency now faces \u2013 and this approval could be given orally in an emergency situation. But the Law Council argues that Australia should not weaken safeguards and should adopt a \u201cdouble lock\u201d authorisation process that is similar to the UK\u2019s Investigatory Powers Act 2016. Under the Law Council\u2019s proposal, the attorney general would make the primary decision on whether to issue a questioning warrant but it would not take effect until it had been reviewed by a judicial officer. The \u201cdouble lock\u201d would result in the cancellation of the warrant if the judicial officer did not confirm the attorney general\u2019s decision. If cancelling a warrant the judicial officer would have to give written reasons to the attorney general and Asio. The Law Council has also sketched out a method for dealing with urgent cases. The attorney general\u2019s decision could take immediate effect but a judicial officer would have to conduct a subsequent review within about three days. Referring to urgent cases, the Law Council said in its submission to the intelligence committee: \u201cIf the judicial officer does not confirm the issuing decision, the warrant is cancelled, and the judicial officer may order the destruction of the intelligence, or may impose conditions on its retention.\u201d Labor members have argued the merits of a double-lock authorisation process, noting it was a safeguard originally introduced by the Howard government. When asked about its position on this safeguard, a Labor spokesperson said: \u201cLabor has a consistent view that extraordinary powers require independent oversight and authorisation.\u201d Labor is expected to come to a final position on the bill after the intelligence committee report is tabled, but it has previously expressed support for expanding the scope of questioning powers to include espionage and foreign interference. The legislation comes amid warnings from Asio that there are now mores spies and proxies operating in Australia than at the height of the cold war. The government is likely to put its legislation to parliament soon, given that the existing questioning powers are due to expire in March, but there are only two more sitting weeks before the Christmas break. The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, chaired by the Liberal MP Andrew Hastie, almost always presents bipartisan consensus reports. Labor is generally reluctant to vote against national security laws in the parliament, fearing political backlash, but has previously used this committee process to push the government to accept additional safeguards. Mike Burgess, the head of Asio, told a committee hearing late last month: \u201cFor all other intrusive powers we use the attorney general is the authorising officer and I think this one should be no different.\u201d But he said if the parliament were to legislate a double-lock authorisation process: \u201cI will accept the law given to us, yes.\u201d Asio has used the compulsory questioning power 16 times since it was introduced by the Howard government after the 11 September 2001 terrorism attacks, but not since 2010. It anticipates an increased use of the powers once they are expanded to cover espionage and foreign interference. Public debate on the Asio powers bill has been focused on lowering the minimum age for compulsory questioning from 16 to 14 years, with minors only allowed to be questioned if they themselves were believed to be involved in politically motivated violence. But external legal advice, commissioned by the progressive group GetUp, has raised concern that the scope of what adults could be questioned about was \u201cexceptionally broad\u201d and it was \u201ceasily foreseeable\u201d that a journalist could face questioning. That legal advice, shared with Guardian Australia last month, also argued some of the work of civil society organisations \u2013 especially those involved in environmental and human rights advocacy \u2013 could be caught by the broad definition of \u201cacts of foreign interference\u201d because it includes clandestine acts that \u201care otherwise detrimental to the interests of Australia\u201d. Asio regards the compulsory questioning power as \u201canother tool in our toolbox\u201d and argues its activities are subject to strong safeguards, including oversight by the inspector general of intelligence and security."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
