It is hardly surprising. He has not had to choose one until now. Does the matter of who leads England out against Paraguay at Anfield tomorrow night now that David Beckham is injured really matter? Surely the real significance of captaining England was lost in Stockholm 10 years ago when Gary Lineker, piqued at being substituted by Graham Taylor, threw the armband away as he traipsed off the pitch. Lineker had been a personable frontman for England but his leadership was not in the mould of Bobby Moore, Billy Wright or, if it came to that, Bryan Robson. At least David Platt, the next regular England captain, was a decent NCO. The importance of choosing the right captain rises or falls according to the prevailing circumstances of the England team. The reason Eriksson needs to give the matter more than a passing thought is that whoever is given the role tomorrow evening will have the chance to establish a prima facie case for promotion if Beckham's broken foot does not heal in time for the World Cup. What England may find themselves needing in Japan is another Mick Mills. Twenty years ago the Ipswich left-back suddenly found himself captain of Ron Greenwood's side for the World Cup in Spain after Kevin Keegan had suffered a back injury. Mills, helped no doubt by his experience as a club captain, so easily assumed the role that by the time England were eliminated it was difficult to imagine him not wearing the armband. A natural leader with strength of character is still important in a major tournament, as Tony Adams demonstrated in Euro 96 and Alan Shearer further emphasised in the last World Cup. Eriksson's difficulty is that the sort of players who might fill the bill tomorrow may not be his first choices for Japan. Gareth Southgate, experienced and articulate, would have to displace Rio Ferdinand in the middle of the defence. Sol Campbell, out tomorrow with a hamstring injury, has already led England but how solid is his partnership with Ferdinand in Eriksson's mind? Of the two, in fact, Ferdinand, another absentee this week, looks the better bet. If seniority is the deciding factor David Seaman is the obvious candidate, and one of his predecesssors in goal for England, Peter Shilton, did captain Bobby Robson's teams during the World Cups of 1986 and 1990. Gary Neville is favoured by some although he is surely one of life's natural lieutenants. The last England captain before Beckham was Martin Keown, who led the side in Helsinki 18 months ago when England, with Howard Wilkinson in charge after Keegan's resignation, shared a scoreless draw which turned out to be more valuable than it appeared at the time. Since Keown is in the present squad only after the loss of Campbell and Ugo Ehiogu to hamstring injuries in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final, he is unlikely to be recommissioned. Eriksson could give it to Steven Gerrard, a natural leader by example, but that period in office might last only until the next groin strain. In a way it is a tribute to Beckham's success as captain that his absence now would appear to leave such a vacuum. He was originally given the responsibility by Peter Taylor, the next caretaker after Wilkinson, whose decision to restrict the squad he took to Turin for a friendly against Italy to players of 30 or under made the Manchester United man a relatively senior figure. The image of Beckham as the slightly sheepish personality who was left out of the starting line-up in the 1998 World Cup because Glenn Hoddle felt he was not properly focused died hard. Yet once Eriksson took over and kept faith in the new captain Beckham showed impressive maturity on and off the field. He has led England in their past 13 matches. Until last Wednesday's tackle by Aldo Duscher of Deportivo La Coruna broke a metatarsal bone and turned the nation into foot experts overnight the question of an alternative captain was not even idle gossip. When Beckham was taken off against Italy at Leeds in the last game the armband was handed to Robbie Fowler. Maybe the England coach will decide tomorrow's line-up first and then think about who should lead it. The choice could lie between Seaman and Southgate, ponytail or horse sense, but Gary Neville might still come up on the rails. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
