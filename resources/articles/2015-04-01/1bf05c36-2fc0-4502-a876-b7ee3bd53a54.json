His proposal comes as the prime minister, David Cameron, counters with a commitment to jobs, confirming that he will extend the employment allowance to 2020, meaning a third of jobs will continue to pay no national insurance for another five years. The employment allowance allows smaller businesses to take on new workers by freeing businesses from at least the first \u00a32,000 of employers\u2019 national insurance contributions. Miliband will say that anyone offered an internship lasting more than a month must be paid the minimum wage. Some of the most sought-after jobs, he will argue, are out of reach for many young people who cannot afford to work for nothing over long internships. The announcement coincides with new YouGov polling data released by Intern Aware showing that Labour\u2019s four-week legal limit would not lead to a reduction in internships. According to the poll, 62% of businesses say it would make no difference to the number of interns they recruit; 10% say it would make them more likely to hire interns; and 10% say it would make them less likely to hire interns. Miliband will say: \u201cIn this country, if you want a good job in a highly prized sector, you\u2019re often asked to work for free, often for months on end, sometimes even a year. It\u2019s a system that\u2019s rigged in favour of those who can afford it. \u201cPutting careers in highly prized jobs \u2013 in the arts, media, fashion, finance and law \u2013 out of reach for huge numbers of highly able young people [is] not fair. It\u2019s not right. And it prevents our companies drawing on all the talents our nation has to offer. So we\u2019ll put a stop to it. We\u2019ll end the scandal of unpaid internship.\u201d The proposal is in line with a recommendation last year from Alan Milburn, the chair of the government\u2019s social mobility and child poverty commission. Milburn said commission research found that key professions including the law, the media, medicine and fashion had rejected pleas by politicians to reduce the number of entrants working for free. In its second annual \u201cstate of the nation\u201d report, the commission said that unless there is a sudden change of heart by professional bodies and employers, the new government elected in May should bring in legislation to ban unpaid internships. Milburn argued: \u201cSome people can afford to work for free, but many cannot. The current system is blocking out individuals with high potential but modest financial means from getting on professional career ladder. If the professions are going to be truly representative of the society they serve, then they will have to do more to actively diversify their workforces.\u201d Ben Lyons, co-founder of Intern Aware, welcomed the pledge, saying it would make a difference to thousands of young people entering the job market. \u201cThe current chasm between twentysomethings who can afford to work for months on end for free and those who can\u2019t is bad for social mobility, bad for business and bad for Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cBusinesses are crying out for clarity on internships, and the four-week limit offers that \u2013 as well as vastly increasing the pool of talent they can draw on. We hope this pledge is the start of a change in the political weather around getting young people into work.\u201d The other measures in the Labour Youth Manifesto are more familiar, including cutting tuition fees from \u00a39,000 to \u00a36,000, increasing student maintenance grants by \u00a3400, and raising the minimum wage to \u00a38 an hour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
