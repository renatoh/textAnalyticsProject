Namely, that Brian is the father of Siobhan's baby. As the wife of Brian for 27 years, Jennifer was understandably devastated when he was forced to break the news to her before their daughter, Debbie, did it for him. The seismic tremors from this earthquake under Ambridge could take another nine months to settle down. Even by the standards of Britain's oldest soap opera, this has been a storyline of epic length and complexity. \"We've kept it bubbling out from under for a long time,\" says editor Vanessa Whitburn, sitting in her office at the BBC's Birmingham studios under a 2001 calendar marking 50 years of The Archers. She has been in charge for 11 years and, before that, she spent four years as a producer on Brookside. \"Our listeners don't expect one blockbuster after another,\" she says. \"They like that mix of the dramatic with the everyday. There seems to be less and less of the everyday in TV soaps,\" she adds, conscious perhaps that Brookside has imploded under the pressure of ever-more implausible plots. The Archers, she concedes, has the benefit of a loyal Radio 4 audience, predominantly As and Bs, and little in the way of competition. Mrs Dale's Diary and Waggoners' Walk disappeared into the ether many year ago, the proposed Asian radio soap is still some way in the future and West Way, set in a multi-cultural health centre in Shepherd's Bush, goes out on the World Service. \"But we're always under pressure to remain as Radio 4's flagship programme,\" says Whitburn, who can point to a rise in the ratings of around 170,000 over the past year. The saga of Brian, Siobhan and baby Ruairidh was conceived over a year and a half ago in the fertile imagination of Joanna Toye, one of 11 scriptwriters. Like all members of the Archers production staff, she puts forward ideas by email for consideration at the long-term planning meetings which are held two or three times a year. \"I encourage them to think the unthinkable,\" says Whitburn. \"Then I draw up a shortlist and we have an away-day somewhere in the country to discuss how they can be developed. Inevitably, the long-term meetings can only deal with the broad brush of the plot. We get down to the fine detail when I chair a meeting of the writers on the first Monday of every month.\" These gatherings tend to be rather more genteel than their equivalent on Brookside, she recalls. The Merseyside soap generated so much passion among its writers that, on one occasion, the contents of the fruit bowl were flying across the table. Did it ever come to fisticuffs? \"No, but they could be very tough with each other verbally. Archers script meetings are more polite, but we can have some strong and heated debates.\" When they are over, Whitburn has two days to write a month's worth of storylines. This is the raw material for the four writers commissioned to produce a week of scripts apiece for the next four weeks. There is a writers' rota. Another four will get their chance the following month. Each has 11 days to invent 90 minutes of dialogue, but only after they've first come up with a detailed, scene-by-scene breakdown for approval by the editor. \"They're ringing each other all the time and then ringing me at home any time of the day or night,\" she says. \"We talk for at least an hour, taking notes all the time. Along with my producer, Julie Beckett, I have to check that each synopsis works in terms of continuity, shape and the balance between humour and serious issues. Editing The Archers is like conducting an orchestra.\" Except that she can never guarantee that those paid to produce the sound are going to be available at the same time. \"Our actors are not on full-time contracts,\" she explains. \"Unlike television, which is a constant round of rehearsals, costume calls, fittings and make-up, radio is a very slick, quick medium. We can record one 15-minute episode in two and a quarter hours, so they're only required to be in the studio five or six days a month. They have other careers.\" There are times when she has to ring writers and ask for some rejigging of the plot to take account of the absence of one actor and the availability of another. Thankfully, there were no such problems when it came to recording this week's denouement of the Brian-and-Siobhan saga. Quite by chance, the task of writing such sensitive scenes fell to The Archers' most experienced scriptwriter. Mary Cutler has been at it for at least 23 years and is almost certainly the only resident of suburban Birmingham to be made an honorary member of the National Farmers' Union. She lives a few miles from the studio, in a former council house on a vast 1930s estate and, right now, she's producing scripts to be broadcast in February. Taking a brief break from her computer terminal, she reminisces about the pleasure of producing the tearjerkers for last night's episode and, indeed, tonight's. \"There were times when I was writing through watery eyes,\" she admits. \"It all became a bit intense. Sometimes it's nice to get back to the village shop and more mundane issues. I think that's where some of the telly soaps go wrong. You can't have big stories all the time. Brookside's a good example. I used to admire it so much in the early days. It did brilliant stories that took a long time to develop. You should never sacrifice characters to the plot. It's a slippery slope.\" What about Brian's character, though? Being besotted by a baby doesn't seem like his style, does it? \"He's got a son,\" says Cutler in a manner that suggests she's had this argument before. \"And he's always wanted a son.\" To inherit Home Farm, perhaps? \"There are some wonderful plots storing up,\" she says, grinning broadly. \"Who knows what'll happen in 20 years' time?\" Not even the editor of The Archers plans that far ahead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
