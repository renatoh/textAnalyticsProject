This week, it's a fact that gets illustrated in pretty impressive fashion as the singer/songwriter straddles the country for a series of charitable gigs: firstly for a couple of appearances for the Teenage Cancer Trust in London, and then later in the week, he returns to his home city for the Manchester V Cancer show. Undoubtedly, it's a smart move in quite a few respects. The band were unavailable for charitable duty at Live8, plus the prospect of a Noel solo show isn't all bad, particularly since Liam occasionally turns up to heckle. Most significantly though, Noel can bring with him those whose itinerary of live music wouldn't necessarily generally include charity events. Still a rock'n'roll star - even if it's in a more liberal and modern way than he may once have imagined. \u00b7 Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Mon 26, Tue 27; MEN Arena, Manchester, Fri 30 iLiKETRAiNS On tour Pop music is traditionally the sound of now. The genius of iLiKETRAiNS, however, rests in the fact that they're more interested in being the sound of then. A band whose sound is akin to Interpol soundtracking a state funeral, it's actually with their subject matter that they really distinguish themselves. This is a band who are fascinated by history and infrastructure: trains, exploration, and in the case of their current single Spencer Perceval, the assassination of a British Prime Minister. All pretty epic, and if success isn't forthcoming, some other reward could be theirs. Possibly a statue, outside a public building. \u00b7 Cockpit, Leeds, Wed 28; Dingwalls, NW1, Thu 29 The Shins On tour Once an outcast from the rock'n'roll party, now the nerd is inheriting the earth. Smart bands like the Decemberists are on the rise. Johnny Marr has joined Modest Mouse. And, into this friendly atmosphere return the Shins - a New Mexico band offering quirky rock music. New album Wincing The Night Away sees the band building on the alt rock of their Chutes Too Narrow LP, bringing new musical angles into play. \u00b7 Barrowland, Glasgow, Sun 25; Wulfrun Hall, Wolverhampton, Mon 26; Manchester University, Tue 27; The Forum, NW5, Wed 28, Thu 29 Robyn London Not a phrase you hear much any more - but Robyn is girl power personified. Formerly a star of holiday resort-style electro pop, and a product emanating from Max Martin's faintly sinister northern European hit factory, the last couple of months have seen Robyn emerge as a musician empowered in her own right. On a financial level, she paid to have herself released from her original contract. On a creative one, she's set to work on writing rather more representative material: her current single Konichiwa Bitches is a funny, hip, and sexually frank dance tune which falls into a family tree which includes Peaches and CSS. Over the full distance of her debut, things can tend a bit too far towards the generically smoochy, but in small doses, Robyn offers short, sharp, shock value, and it's definitely worth seeing. \u00b7 Cargo, EC2, Thu 29"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
