The Scotsman's decision to give his version of events after the notorious meeting between United and Arsenal at Old Trafford in October drew an immediate and angry response from Wenger following his team's damaging 1-0 defeat by Bolton. In a newspaper interview, Ferguson claims that Wenger sprinted towards him in the tunnel following United's 2-0 victory, a result that ended Arsenal's 49-match unbeaten league run, with his hands raised and shouting: 'What do you want to do about it?' After his side's latest defeat, Wenger first refused to deny Ferguson's version of events, but, nevertheless, in insisting that he will never again respond to a Ferguson accusation, did precisely that. 'I think I have always been consistent with that story and told you that nothing happened in the corridor,' said Wenger. 'With Ferguson, one thing is very simple - and I will never answer any questions any more about that man, that's quite simple. If he has to talk, he talks. If he has to make a newspaper article, he makes a newspaper article - it doesn't interest me and it doesn't matter to me at all. 'I will never answer any provocation from that man again. He does what he wants in England anyway, but he can go abroad one day and see how it is there.' When pressed further, Wenger refused to elaborate upon whether he concedes Ferguson's accusations. 'I just gave you the right answer,' said Wenger. 'Maybe I don't speak English well enough.' Wenger's response, fuelled no doubt in part by his team's performance and disastrous result at Bolton, indicated, yet again, the level of ill-feeling between the two clubs. It also has to be said that the usually unflappable Frenchman was clearly irritated by the latest development. In his account of the 'battle of the buffet' that left Ferguson covered in pizza and soup, the United manager alleges that Wenger was publicly criticising United players in the tunnel, calling them cheats after the game. Ferguson claims he left the United dressing room and told the Frenchman to leave his players alone and return to Arsenal's room. Ferguson continued: 'He came sprinting towards me with his hands raised, saying \"What do you want to do about it?\" He was standing right there. To not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable. It is a disgrace. But I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise.' \u00b7 You can mail the Observer direct at sport@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
