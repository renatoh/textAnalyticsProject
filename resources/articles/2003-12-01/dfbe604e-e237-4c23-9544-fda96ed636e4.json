A group of 75 student society representatives staged a public protest after the university's vice-chancellor, Sir Martin Harris, declined an invitation from the student union to talk about his stance on the controversial issue of top-up fees. The university's National Union of Students' general secretary Hassan Alvi said: \"We wanted him [Sir Martin] to come and speak, but he sent his apologies, and that is why we had to do this demonstration.\" A university spokesperson said that the vice-chancellor has not made any public statements in favour of top-up fees. \"He hasn't come out in favour of them,\" the spokesperson said. Sir Martin is meeting with the student executive this week to discuss the fees situation in greater detail. The Manchester Metropolitan Student Union, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology and the National Executive Committee of the National Union of Students were also represented at the rally, which Mr Hassan described as lively. \"They were making a lot of noise,\" he said. Yesterday, the chair of the Commons' education select committee, Barry Sheerman, accused the NUS and its members of being \"selfish\" in their fight against top-up fees. He told EducationGuardian.co.uk: \"Their agenda is selfish. When I was a student we cared about what happened to the world. This present generation of students say: 'I want I must have'.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
