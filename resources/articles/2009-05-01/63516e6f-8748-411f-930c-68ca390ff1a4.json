The Londoner, fifth on his two previous starts on the US Tour, finished two shots behind Rory Sabbatini at the HP Byron Nelson Championship in Irving, Texas. The South African, the joint overnight leader with John Mallinger of the US, also returned a 64 for a 19-under total of 261. DA Points of the US was third on 16 under after a 65. Davis, a former Spanish Open champion, was the joint leader after four birdies in five holes from the 7th, but Sabbatini moved clear again and kept his nerve after Davis put the pressure on again with a 26-foot eagle putt on the 16th. It is the third second place of Davis's US Tour career, and a fifth victory on the circuit for Sabbatini. \"I can't do any more than that,\" said the 34-year-old Davis, who won the US Tour qualifying school in 2004. \"I had a shaky start. I was able to give it a good push but Rory was doing really well.\" For Sabbatini the win held special significance, as he linked his first triumph since the 2007 Colonial in nearby Fort Worth with Byron Nelson \u2013 who the tournament is named after \u2013 in the same way he had done with Ben Hogan at that event. \"It's a great feeling to win anything associated with 'Lord' Byron,\" he said. \"To always be linked to two of the greatest names in golf, that's pretty amazing. That's something I can always cherish. We are going to be partying tonight.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
