It was not just that they were knocked out of the Champions League, slipping into the Europa League, where they could face Manchester United, it was that they did not even give themselves a chance to continue. Their fate not entirely in their own hands, it was always likely to end but it was not supposed to end this way. Neville said he had \u201cdesperately wanted a victory\u201d; instead, he got a 2-0 defeat to Lyon, a side that had not won in the group before this game. Neville insisted afterwards that Valencia would take the Europa League seriously and that the possibility they might face United is \u201cthe last thing on my mind\u201d. He had hoped to avoid playing in the competition, but always knew that was not going to be easy, the damage done before his arrival. His opening game was always an improbable rescue mission, although there were moments of hope here, which were all too swiftly extinguished. Valencia faced a Lyon team that knew it would finish bottom, without even Europa League football to play for. But not only did they have to win, they also had to hope Ghent did not beat Zenit St Petersburg. Zenit, already group winners, travelled to Belgium without Hulk or Axel Witsel and with nothing to play for. \u201cWe will focus on what we can control,\u201d Neville said. Ultimately, they controlled little. Above all they could not control Lyon\u2019s counterattacks. Not least, the manager said, because the squad he has is an exhausted one. \u201cIf the result in Gent does not go our way, that\u2019s life,\u201d Neville had said. The result in Valencia did not go their way either. That\u2019s life too \u2013 the life that he has chosen. It will be a hard one, although he said that he felt no stress down on the touchline. Here, on a night when his goalkeeper Jaume Dom\u00e9nech prevented the scoreline being more damaging, when the performance was as disappointing as the result, Neville insisted that he could have \u201cno complaints\u201d, there was more evidence of that. Not only did Valencia lose the game, they lost yet another player to injury when Enzo P\u00e9rez was forced off. The list of players out is now 10 men long. Neville has work ahead; the good news is that he will not shirk it. Neville called this the first day of the rest of his life. As the players warmed up, he took up a position in the top-right corner of his technical area. From there he watched his team start well, Shkodran Mustafi hitting the post with one header on eight minutes and having a goal disallowed two minutes after that. But soon news came through from Belgium, where Ghent had scored, and he first abandoned the position in the 36th minute, when Maxwel Cornet curled in a wonderful shot from the edge of the penalty area. He returned soon after but the balance had tilted. Had Mustafi\u2019s goal stood it may have been different but the impetus had quickly changed, the pace dropping. Afterwards, Neville admitted that many of his players were tired. The fans tired too and that the stadium fell quiet, the air punctured by occasional frustrated whistles, was significant as Neville had recalled how coming to the Mestalla as an away player was \u201chorrible\u201d and insisted that was something he wanted to recover. On Monday morning, the doors to the Paterna training ground were opened. Three thousand fans came. \u201cIt\u2019s good to create that link and it motivates the players,\u201d Neville said. Training, though, is one thing; this match was another. \u201cThey tried to get behind us but the deflation was normal,\u201d Neville admitted. Although Paco Alc\u00e1cer drew a save from Anthony Lopes, Lyon were the better side, allowed to travel a long way when they came forward, and it was not a huge surprise when Cornet scored. Momentarily, there was a roar to try to get Valencia back into the contest, an attempt to carry the side, but it was brief. Valencia needed three goals: two here and another for Zenit. \u00c1lvaro Negredo was introduced as they sought them, finally returning from a 65-day ostracism imposed upon him by the former manager Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, cheered as he ran on. Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and Javi Fuego both took shots from the edge of the box, Negredo and Alc\u00e1cer almost carved open a chance too. Yet the truth was that Neville\u2019s side drew only one real save from Lopes and a sense that there was little real chance took over\u2026 until, just as Lyon were preparing to take a corner, there was a huge roar. Artyom Dzyuba had scored for Zenit in Belgium. One down, two more to go and Valencia had 25 minutes to get them. Cancelo almost caught out Lopes at the near post and from the corner Dani Parejo\u2019s shot slipped just wide. The risk, though, was that on the break Lyon were finding space behind and that Dom\u00e9nech wouldn\u2019t be able to save them every time. And so it proved. With 15 minutes to go and Pablo Piatti having just been sent on, Alexandre Lacazette was sent racing through to end Neville\u2019s hopes of a winning managerial debut. As if to make sure, a moment later, Ghent got a second."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
