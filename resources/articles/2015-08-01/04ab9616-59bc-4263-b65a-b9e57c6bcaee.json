Instead, Silva is back in the town squares and backstreets of Brazil\u2019s south-eastern city of Uberl\u00e2ndia, where daily dance-offs provided moments of respite from the grind of life in the favelas. \u201cDancing was a remedy for me, just like it is to so many [poor] people in Brazil today. It was something everyone I know used to do, everybody was part of one dance group or another,\u201d explained Silva of the dances born of enduring racial divides that have long seen African-Brazilians marginalised in the country with the world\u2019s largest black population outside Nigeria. African\u2013Brazilians account for just over half of Brazil\u2019s population, but make up three-quarters of inhabitants living in extreme poverty. As the Rio Olympics one-year countdown begins, preparations have so far failed to live up to promised development in deprived communities. Some fear it may chiefly benefit a small moneyed elite, much as once-grassroots activities like football and Carnival, the quintessential samba festival, increasingly exclude the masses who make up its beating heart. One small company aims to upset that imbalance. The spirit of dan\u00e7as da rua (street dances) \u2013 whose fusion of hip-hop, samba and the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira are most at home in gritty neighbourhoods \u2013 led to the formation of Bal\u00e9 de Rua, which now dazzles audiences in 13 countries and this week plays at London\u2019s popular Southbank summer festival. Like a handful of other small outfits, the company \u2013 composed entirely of local street toughs \u2013 has helped implant Brazil on the international dance map. At the centre of Bal\u00e9 de Rua\u2019s ethos is a celebration of an African heritage that was once repressed. \u201cYou cannot talk about the history of Brazil without talking about dance, and you can\u2019t talk about dance without talking about Africa,\u201d said Fernando Narduchi, Bal\u00e9 de Rua\u2019s co-founder. In the 17th century, African slaves and their descendants so outnumbered Europeans that Jesuit missionary Frei Antonio Viera declared Brazil had \u201cthe body of America and the soul of Africa\u201d. By the time it became the last country to abolish the trans-Atlantic slave trade, in 1888, some 4 million people \u2013 10 times more than in America and Canada \u2013 had been brought to the country. Bal\u00e9 de Rua unravels that legacy through vibrant drumming and Afro-Brazilian instruments such as the berimbau, a slender lute. Then there is the capoeira, whose intricate, graceful movements helped runaway slaves disguise the iron-fisted martial art as a dance. Centre stage, in an explosive burst of movement, is the samba, which began as an underground movement in the late 1800s, as many upper-class Brazilians feared its African roots could foment social uprisings. Even modern dance couldn\u2019t escape politics: in the mid-1970s, the Afro-Brazilian dance group Ile Aye was threatened with beatings and prison for its street-corner drumming that aimed to raise black consciousness. Yet Bal\u00e9 de Rua came into being almost by chance. One evening, co-founder Narduchi stumbled upon a group of kids showing off their moves in a town square. Mesmerised, he watched them coiling and arching, bending and twisting \u201cas if they had no spines\u201d, as he puts it. \u201cThese kids had no formal classical dance training, but there was so much joy and power in their dancing,\u201d said Narduchi, who grew up in a house filled with music from his Lebanese immigrant grandparents \u2013 orchestras, ballets and the likes of Burt Bacharach. That night, he came up with an idea for a new company that was seemingly far removed from such classical music. For years, though, it remained a purely local movement, concentrating mainly on the development of free district schools and training hundreds of community children in dance each year. Then, in 1992, Narduchi and two friends, Marco Ant\u00f4nio Garcia and Jos\u00e9 Marciel Silva, decided to take a gamble and head to the prestigious Lyons Dance Biennale. They called their group of amateurs the Dan\u00e7a Bal\u00e9 de Rua \u2013 \u201cstreet ballet crew\u201d \u2013 in a dig at those who saw ballet as the only valid form of dancing. The swagger paid off, with the group proving a hit. Its troupe continues to live up to its name. Narduchi says those who are classically trained would struggle to \u201cunlearn their training\u201d, so its globe-trotting dancers and musicians are still all plucked from the streets of Uberl\u00e2ndia. That makes international success for those like Silva all the sweeter. \u201cLondon was a place we all heard about on television,\u201d he said, \u201cthe land of the Queen and castles, you know? Each time I come here, I can\u2019t believe it. I never thought it could happen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
