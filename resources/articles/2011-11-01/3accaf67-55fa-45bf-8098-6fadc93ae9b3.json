The midfielder's first start for Fabio Capello, in Tuesday's 1-0 win against Sweden, was a success. The 20-year-old joined the attack competently, and he came close to scoring when a first-half header clipped a post. Starting alongside Rodwell were Phil Jones and Kyle Walker, with Daniel Sturridge making his full debut as a second-half replacement, and the Everton player said he is excited to be one of the fresh band. \"It was a dream come true to step on the pitch against Spain [last Saturday]. It was my full debut. If I can stay in and around the squad I'm happy. We've had a good bond for a couple of years [the Under-21 players]. All of the lads have welcomed me in the seniors. I know a few of the lads from Everton. As soon as I stepped through the door I have felt really comfortable.\" Of the transition to the senior side, he added: \"I'm used to the Under-21s. It's a bit of a difference there but it's a step up again. It's a different tempo to the game.\" Asked his favoured position, Rodwell said: \"I've played all over, to be honest. Centre-half, defensive midfield, attacking midfield. I have been playing box-to-box more for Everton as a two so I have felt comfortable in that position, but anywhere across the midfield I can play. It's for the country and I'll play anywhere. To get forward and get some shots off, which I managed to do, is exciting. \"With Phil Jones sitting [deeper] he [Capello] asked me and Gareth Barry to get forward and get into the box, which I managed to do. I got on the end of a couple of crosses. I felt like I did OK. I got into good positions and I felt like I should have scored the header. I'll be going over that. It's one of them: nine out of 10 I'll put it in the back of net. But I take the positive that I got in the right position \u2026 I took a knock as well in the first half. All in all, I'm pleased with my performance and it was a good team performance.\" The new boys also included the 30-year-old Bobby Zamora, who won his second cap but made his first start against Sweden, and he will pose Capello difficulties when selecting a 23-man squad for Euro 2012. Rodwell welcomes this. \"The competition is healthy, it's good to have that. I'm just going to keep my feet on the ground, working hard, and try to play as well as I can for Everton and see what happens,\" he said, before singling out Jones. \"He did really well. He made a couple of good runs through and could have got on the score-sheet himself. He's a great talent.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
