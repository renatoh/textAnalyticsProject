Thus paradox and anachronism are multiply present in Bath Music festival's sell-out new Dido and Aeneas: chilly night air, steaming Roman baths with Purcell's 17th-century opera played out in modern dress on a perilously narrow stage. Dido's palace is a home counties sitting room and the Trojan hero is sensibly kitted out in cardigan and what, across the shimmering, acrid spa waters illuminated by eight flares, looked like Hush Puppies. Singers from the Royal College of Music and soloists joined the early music ensemble Florilegium, directed by Ashley Solomon, in this bold endeavour which was magical yet baffling. Chintz armchair, TV and toppled standard lamps, in Martin Constantine's overcomplicated staging choreographed by Jennifer Fletcher, reflected the mental confusion of Queen Dido, widowed and now in love with Aeneas (Robert Davies). He treats her churlishly while she grows all the more unhinged. The instruction \"strip to your undies\" is nowhere mentioned in Virgil's epic, but Helen-Jane Howells abandoned her tea dress and was fearless, even as temperatures and rain fell, singing with purity and honesty and no sign of shivering. Her \"Remember me\" in the famous Lament was heart-rending. The chorus, whose expert contributions came across best in the challenging acoustic, appeared to be synchronised undertakers in black suits with top hats pulled down low. Belinda, tenderly sung by Elin Manahan Thomas, was brightly supported by Rowan Pierce as Second Woman. Almost no words were audible but the instrumental ensemble sounded delicate and sensuous, complemented by beguiling noises off: trickling thermal waters, city bells and the unmistakable crash of a delivery of bottles. The thunder machine sounded like an earthquake and the privilege of being in these ancient ruins at night added to the mystique. The programme forgot to mention the name of the skilful designer, Sophie Mosberger, but since they omitted the composer's name too she should feel honoured. According to convention, since Purcell the UK had no great composer until Britten, unless we count Elgar, which we probably should. One organisation was founded expressly to challenge this prejudice. Now in its seventh year, the English Music festival has exhumed works by Sullivan, Ireland, Moeran, Finzi and a litany of other less familiar names now edging back into the mainstream. In the course of attending this festival, subtitled The Spirit of England and not automatically my natural habitat, I have heard radiant choral works \u2013 by Holst, Dyson, John Gardner and others \u2013 and tedious string suites (no need for names) as well as lively ones too. The organisers have now set up a publishing and recording arm, and judging by the near-capacity audience at Dorchester Abbey have found a following hungry for this broadly pastoral repertoire. The long list of past \"premieres\" mostly consists of works written up to a century ago and forgotten. But on bank holiday Monday, the festival closed with eight new works and commissions, all worth hearing. The composer Ben Palmer, doubling as conductor of the versatile Orchestra of St Paul's, mustered robust originality in his Sinfonietta. Christopher Wright's Legend conjured an intriguing, dark atmosphere which befitted its depiction of a barren East Anglian landscape. The biggest undertaking was David Owen Norris's sprawling, ear-catching Symphony. Best known as a pianist but also a man of boggling versatility, Norris clearly had fun. A soulful slow movement nodded towards Elgar or Mahler, while swooping, wah-wah brass suggested, as Norris himself put it, a \"slightly blurred\" evening at Ronnie Scott's. He also names those great melodists Joni Mitchell, the Beach Boys and Orlando Gibbons as influences. The final Ground was built on a repeating bass figure or passacaglia, a timely reminder of Purcell who used the same device in Dido's Lament. If some pieces passed by agreeably, sounding as if they could have been written any time in the past 50 years, the best \u2013 David Matthews's haunting White Nights, a revision of a violin concerto \u2013 left an indelible mark. Rupert Marshall-Luck tackled the sinewy solo part with fluency. Matthews (b1943) uses traditional methods yet creates music that is dazzlingly new. After a week celebrating The Rite of Spring, in which Stravinsky plundered ancient archetypes and shaped them into radical novelty, these are questions to think about. The art world is better at embracing work that, in manner, style and technique, could belong to another era. They have a term for it: retardataire, roughly meaning harking back. As usual, bowls of fruit and seascapes, good and bad, will jostle alongside installations made out of popcorn and chocolate chillies, say, at the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition when it opens on 10 June. The musical equivalent is tunes and tonal harmonies written for conventional orchestral forces. The best, independently of any superficial modernism, will always shine true. The worst will always confirm that banality knows no stylistic bounds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
