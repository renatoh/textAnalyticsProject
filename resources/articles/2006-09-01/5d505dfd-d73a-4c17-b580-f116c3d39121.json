In those frown-filled days of fixed exchange rates and balance of payments crises, a single aircraft import could send the cabinet into a swoon. In 1967 James Callaghan even resigned as chancellor after devaluing sterling. Membership of the European exchange rate mechanism, until the pound's ejection in 1992, gave a more recent generation a reminder of what their predecessors went through. Yet the launch of the euro in 1999 was accompanied by predictions that sterling would dissolve into insignificance on the world's financial markets. Some even predicted the pound could wither away in domestic use, driven out by the potent new single European currency. Not only have those predictions proved to be inaccurate, but sterling is enjoying a new lease of life. Instead, the major casualty has been the Swiss franc, now a pale shadow of the euro. New figures show that sterling has surpassed the Japanese yen in popularity for international investors, putting it third behind the US dollar and the euro. Sterling's buoyancy on the foreign exchange markets remains high - the cause of serious problems for the UK's beleaguered exporters but a boon for British travellers and importers. Perhaps Harold Wilson wasn't so far off in 1967, when he assured Britain that \"the pound in your pocket\" was still worth having."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
