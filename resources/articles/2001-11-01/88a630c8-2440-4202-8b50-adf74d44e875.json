It was a quietly honed ambition charged, he had hoped, with little drama except perhaps over what colour to paint the walls. In 1974 when the former builder and his wife, Anne, first set their hearts on the property they could not have dreamed of the impact it would have had on the political life of Scotland. But a wrangle over the feudal title of the premises saw the bewildered pensioner, three decades on, stumbling into 'Officegate' and the short-lived premiership of Scotland's second First Minister. After 378 days in the job, Henry McLeish, former footballer and Fife council leader, was last week limping off the field to the incredulous gasps of spectators. Red-eyed and tear stained he had by Thursday buckled under the pressure from his political adversaries, the media and his own colleagues to come clean over muckraking charges that he had fiddled his expenses. Questions that started as a whisper in a Sunday newspaper back in April over why the MSP for Fife had been claiming expenses from Westminster for his constituency office in Glenrothes while accepting rent for the building from more than one source, including Edinburgh-based lawyers, Digby Brown, became deafening. Duncan celebrated McLeish's political slaughter last week. It crystallised why calls for assistance from the man who was his local MP had festered for more than a decade, leaving him in mounting debt. Digby Brown was the very law firm he was complaining to him about - while all the time they had the office upstairs. 'McLeish brought this on himself. I am sad it has had to come to this. I am not a vindictive man. But his resignation is a good thing for Scotland. It has been proved he is not an honourable man.' To be fair the First Minister had fielded the initial allegations with some dexterity. He paid back \u00a39,000 to the Fees Office from his own pocket. That was money said to have been supplied by Digby Brown between 1998 and 2001. He insisted had been the product of 'a muddle not a fiddle'. McLeish naively hoped the matter had been cleared up. But a keener understanding could have saved his political bacon. Instead further media diligence had by this time uncovered a less benign figure nearer \u00a340,000. Other companies and bodies such as Thompsons, the industrial-compensation specialist, and Fife council were all exposed for sub-letting the offices. Moreover his Holyrood sparring partners, Tory leader David McLetchie and John Swinney of the SNP, were in fighting form. The words 'put up or shut up' from the First Minister over the latest revelations were red rags they seized with alacrity. So too did a slavering Scot tish press. None the less, McLeish battled on. It was not until he was savaged before millions of British viewers by David Dimbleby on Question Time that his real ineptitude was grasped. The veteran broadcaster compared his interviewee's shame with that of a common benefit fraudster. Why should he escape judgment? He then gave him the rope to begin to fashion his own noose. McLeish confessed he did not know how much more money was in question. A figure of \u00a336,000 emerged and once more McLeish apologised. He confessed to accepting money from five tenants - but not for personal gain - with a relieved sigh. On Wednesday evening he attended a sports gala dinner at Holyrood House with the Princess Royal. It was the day before he had agreed to a full explanation before a no-confidence debate in the Scottish Parliament. He appeared to be coping well. Though he was visibly weary he managed to grin at jibes from a comic about the whole debacle. But then part way through the evening he disappeared to make a phone call. When he returned he had turned pale. He now knew his exit was imminent and unavoidable. The beleaguered politician had learnt the Herald had evidence that a sixth party had been renting the premises. Despite the insignificant peppercorn fee involved, this was completely unacceptable and he knew it. His career had turned to dust. He wept tears of genuine grief for most of the morning of the following day when he decided to stand down. Dull Henry's critics had been proved right. They said he was not up to the job and that like John Major he was a grey-face in a grey suit who would never make an impression on the electorate. The 'tragedy' - the word used by Tony Blair to describe the whole unfortunate affair - was just that. No matter what his detractors might have said McLeish had been growing into his political boots. Both Blair and Gordon Brown had tried to talk him out of quitting. It made all the more pitiful the scene faced by his closest aides and advisers early on Thursday - that of a broken man. McLeish surrendered emotionally before the team who had come so close to saving their master. A friend said: 'He went through the emotions I would expect anyone to go through given that news. He was nowhere near breakdown. He cried for a bit and was bruised for a while; he was grieving.' For three days surrounding last weekend his aides battled round the clock to save McLeish's skin. He was told that he must open his heart and his books and take full and frank information into the public domain. For 15 hours a day they hardly saw daylight. In Bute House, they skipped sleep and lived off takeaways to rake through constituency files. One observer said: 'It was a mess of papers and fish and chip wrappers. Three weeks' work was crammed into three days.' By the Tuesday of last week McLeish was ready to face the music. His aides were as sure as they could be that everything was there. A Labour source maintains: 'He was asked if there was anything else on several occasions. Nothing came forward. Who can ever know whether he knew about the sixth sub-let or whether it had gone out of his mind? But if that information had been available he would still be First Minister today.' He would have survived, albeit as damaged goods. No matter what trauma lay ahead, Tuesday was a great success. The strategy had paid off - at least temporarily. McLeish was elated after his confessional. He even won a round of applause from his party. His career was still intact. But any celebratory mood was to be short-lived. By the next day there was further baying for blood. News that the Third Age, a charity for the elderly, was also renting offices, albeit for a paltry \u00a325 a week (\u00a31,200 a year) was about to be dished up for the nation to devour. It was the straw to break the camel's back. McLeish's decision to quit was not made until the Thursday morning. He had had enough and so had his family and friends. He knew that the wrangle could damage the party and it was time to go. Grief etched across his face and, exhausted from weeping, he rang his wife Julie with the news from St Andrew's House. She too tried to talk him round. But it was no good. And then from somewhere he steeled himself to face the Parliament. By noon he had bucked up. He ate a hearty lunch of bridie, chips and beans, in his private offices. After this, the First Minister changed into a new suit and reached for his eye drops to clear his vision for the job in hand. The chamber was heaving when he determinedly entered at 2.30pm. Silence swept the arena as he strode to his seat through a ripple of applause that rose into a welcoming reception. Eyes still swollen and raw he delivered his historic final statement. Gone was the gauche awkwardness that had dogged him in recent days: 'Let me acknowledge again today my mistakes in the matter of constituency office sub-lets and my mistakes in the way I handled the matter. What is important is that I take full personal responsibility. Others who work with me and for me have been criticised, but the ultimate responsibility is mine and mine alone.' He added: 'We led on devolution. We delivered devolution and with our colleagues in a historic coalition, we are determined to make devolution work. 'I would be the last person to willingly or knowingly put the principles behind these new and great institutions at risk and in doing so put at risk everything I have cherished over 25 years in politics.' He pledged to continue his work as an MSP for Central Fife, shook hands with David Steel, before embracing his wife and being driven away. But where did it all go so wrong? Why did a seemingly trivial matter bring an intelligent politician to his knees? It was paltry scandal compared with the buckets of Tory sleaze gathered in Westminster during the Eighties. And if the British Government managed to weather the antics of Jeffrey Archer, Cecil Parkinson, Jonathan Aitken, et al, why was Holyrood not up to holding on tight and waiting? Some have suggested this was murder by media. Maureen Macmillan, Highlands and Islands MSP, levelled this charge. One Labour source says: 'It was death by a thousand cuts and the cuts were largely self-inflicted. The media, if you like, delivered the coffin.' Others suggest that neither Henry McLeish the man nor his fiscal woes had anything to do with his demise. Professor Lindsay Paterson, of the University of Edinburgh, believes the Scottish Parliament represents a threat to the power of two social groups in Scotland. The first is the Conservative establishment in and around Edinburgh who have hefty support from right-wing newspapers. It is no coincidence that the Daily Mail and the Scotsman (Andrew Neil's baby) have championed some of the most vicious attacks.The second group is a faction within the Labour Party that oppose modernisation. 'This whole episode has not been about Henry McLeish and his expenses but the reluctance of these two establishments to see a truly radical body having its way,' explains Paterson. 'The two establishments have been systematically trying to undermine the parliament because they feel the parliament has been undermining them. The radical forces trying to democratise Scotland did not recognise the scale of the battle on their hands.' Another source who refused to be named endorsed this theory. 'There is a real democratic deficit in the Scottish press. A party which received 13 per cent of the Scottish vote [the Conservatives] have well over half the Scottish papers behind them and well over half of the columnists behind them. A lot of columnists don't necessarily believe in devolution and were more than willing to give it a kick.' Then there was talk of McLeish shouldering accountancy mistakes made by his first wife, Margaret, who died of cancer in 1995. She ran his office and dealt with much of the paperwork. She could have conveniently taken the rap. But despite newspaper speculation a source close to McLeish maintained the very idea appalled him. 'I was present when someone said to Henry \"I can't understand why you are not telling anyone about Margaret. People will understand that that is a lot of reason why you are not going into a lot of detail\". He immediately said no, ruling it out completely.' Spin doctors like Peter MacMahon, the former Scotsman and Mirror political editor who was McLeish's Alastair Campbell are likely to go. His \u00a31.5 million a year media machine has been lambasted for allowing this to happen. MacMahon will be looking for a new job. But in his defence insiders claim he could only work with the information at his disposal. McLeish was known to be a private man who perhaps needed lessons in sharing vital information with those who mattered. The whole debacle means that McLeish's successor will have to watch their step, every inch of the way. The wolves will be at the gate, watching and waiting for another chance to salivate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
