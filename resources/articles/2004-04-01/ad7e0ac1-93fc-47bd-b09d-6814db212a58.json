In an email sent shortly after Christmas and headed, \"Suffering from SAD (skint and depressed)?\", Egg suggested customers should cheer themselves up by \"pampering\" themselves - and to \"stick it on the card\". \"New Year's Day's come and gone. Resolutions made at 11.50pm were broken at 12.01am and your bank account looks like Nick Leeson's been at it,\" the email read. \"Can't face the thought of work? Then throw a sickie and bed down for the day, where all you need to think about is how to pamper yourself next.\" The Advertising Standards Authority launched an investigation after receiving two complaints from members of the public who believed the email was irresponsible because it encouraged people to run up debts at a time when they could least afford it, and to feign illness to get off work. Egg told the watchdog that the language was intended to appeal to their 25 to 40-year-old customers who were familiar with their use of \"edgy, humorous and quirky customer communications\". However, the ASA ruled the \"tone of the newsletter was irresponsible\" and asked Egg not to repeat the approach. The Bank of England recently warned of a looming debt crisis as homeowners capitalise on low interest rates and rising house prices to borrow. The number of people going bankrupt rose by almost a third last year, and the increase has been blamed partly on people amassing excessive debts on credit and store cards. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
