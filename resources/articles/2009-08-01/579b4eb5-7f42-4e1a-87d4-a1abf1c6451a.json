It would be rude not to. A line has been crossed. What conclusions should we draw from readers' responses to it? There were relatively few objections \u2013 around 15 \u2013 and most of them were about the fact that the word was spelled out in full, rather than the paper's decision to run a front-page story about a TV presenter's use of it. The British have a propensity for profanity and lewdness. Speak for yourself, I hear some of you say, and I do. Still, there's a distinction, as readers are in the habit of pointing out, between what you say \u2013 or wouldn't necessarily object to \u2013 in informal speech and what you expect to see in a newspaper. Guardian readers, as you often tell me when you complain about foul language and crudity, are not easily shocked. How could you be with so much effing and blinding in print and online? \"Fuck\", for instance, has made an appearance 470 times this year already, and the more taboo C-word has cropped up in 61 items. These profanities are more frequent in the culture and music sections than elsewhere and they nearly always appear, in speech marks, when someone else's words are reported. The Guardian's editorial code says: \"There is almost never a case in which we need to use a swearword outside direct quotes.\" Complaints about inappropriate language usually concern breaches of this part of the code in columns written by contributors, but the front-page C-word story, on 25 July, which reported Jeremy Clarkson's not-for-broadcast remarks about the prime minister to a Top Gear studio audience, was in line with editorial policy. If you think I'm wrong about the British tendency to profane you might call to mind David Cameron's off-the-dirty-cuff remarks last month. During a radio interview listeners heard the leader of the Conservative party's casual use of \"twat\" and \"pissed off\". His bad language was primly and thinly disguised in some newspaper reports, but not in the Guardian, which doesn't hold with the asterisked swearword \u2013 its editorial code calls this attempt at diluting offence \"a cop out\". Although \"pissed off\" is too demotic for some and \"twat\" still retains power to offend, for many people these words barely register as bad language anymore. I didn't get any complaints when they were printed in full (though not on the front page) in reports about Cameron's conversational blunder and his subsequent apology. By contrast several of the complainants about the C-word a few days later, thought the paper should have opted for asterisks. \"It smacks of 'Hey, aren't I clever, I can use really bad swear words',\" said a reader who complained that her children should be able to read front-pages articles without coming across one of the most offensive words in the English language. \"If you had deleted the middle letters, adults would have understood the article, it was really unnecessary and, in my mind, childish and irresponsible,\" she said. The headline on the piece, which occupied the \"basement slot\" at the bottom of the page, used \"C-word\", but the text reported the word in full, twice. Clarkson is one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters, he had to apologise earlier this year after calling Gordon Brown \"a one-eyed Scottish idiot\" at a press conference and that made the story newsworthy, Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian's editor in chief, told me. \"In the present climate the behaviour of BBC stars is considered news by all news organisations,\" he said. Was publishing all four letters of the four-letter word justifiable? \"It was already completely obvious what Jeremy Clarkson had said and there was no need to repeat the word which, as the article itself pointed out, many people find very offensive,\" said another reader. \"The story here is that this is still the most taboo word, but one of the BBC's flagship presenters feels confident about using it in front of an audience,\" said Rusbridger. \"The Guardian doesn't want to be coy about what these words are.\" reader@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
