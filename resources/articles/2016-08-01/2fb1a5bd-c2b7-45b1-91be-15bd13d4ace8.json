Beckett is the five-year-old\u2019s fourth trainer in as many seasons on the track but Kinema\u2019s first run for the yard in May was a career-best, promptly followed up by another from a rating of 99 to win an ultra-competitive race at Royal Ascot. He did not get home over two miles in the Group Two Goodwood Cup last time out in July, but is a proven stayer at this 14-furlong trip. A draw on the wide outside is perhaps not ideal but six of the last seven winners have come from double-figure draws - including one from stall 22 - and it may not be the handicap it once was. Tips for today\u2019s other TV races York 2.15 A significant step up for Diploma after a Listed race success in July. Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s filly faces a much deeper field here, including Custom Cut, successful two years ago, but looked very useful last time and should be equal to the test. Sandown 2.30 Unbeaten after four starts, Persuasive should make a smooth transition to Pattern company. Her comfortable handicap success at Royal Ascot last time was a match for any form in today\u2019s field and further progress seems likely. York 2.50 Though Injam had only two rivals to beat at Haydock last time, he did so with ease in a decent time, showing sharp improvement for a step up to this trip. He is up against runners from some of the biggest yards, including Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Kellstorm, a brother to the Gold Cup winner, Order Of St George. Shraaoh\u2019s chance is obvious, too, but the selection may have crept in under the radar as a result and 16-1 is a very fair each-way price. Sandown 3.05 The progressive South Seas has looked like a potential Group One juvenile in his two starts to date and can underline it here, with the step up to seven furlongs likely to bring about further improvement. York 3.25 Mehmas got the better of Blue Point in the Richmond Stakes at Glorious Goodwood last time but the experience should bring him on and his 11-length win at Doncaster in July is still etched on the memory. He remains a colt of huge potential and can prove himself a candidate for the Classics. Sandown 3.40 The Hugo Palmer-trained Baydar is on a roll and posted his best effort yet last time, beating a previous winner in a good time. The fourth home there is a winner since and a 5lb rise looks fair with the useful apprentice Josephine Gordon taking off 3lb."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
