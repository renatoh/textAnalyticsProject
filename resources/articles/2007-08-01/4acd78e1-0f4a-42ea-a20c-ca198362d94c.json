They rose at the crack of dawn to hand out fines to early risers who had unrolled 10 towels on the public beach by 6am which they had no intention of using until later. In Italy it is sometimes difficult to find a public beach, such is the proliferation of private ones. It is important that those which do exist are not undermined by individual acts of privatisation by stealth. The problem does not arise in the same way in Britain, which does not have that kind of private beach, for which let us be thankful. Even those stretches of sand that are privately owned usually have a right of way attached for those walking along the beach. We may like to think this is a defining British characteristic, like giving blood freely, but it may also owe something to the fact that lower temperatures have not generated pressure for commercial sunbathing. Paris responded to the concept a few years ago by importing sand to create \"Paris Plage\" on the banks of the Seine. The commendable intention was to enrich the lives of low-income families who could not afford to go on holiday, particularly those from the banlieues. In practice it has been colonised by tourists and the better-off. Nevertheless, the concept of urban public beaches could be extended to London, where there are already some embryonic ones. There would difficulties arising from tides, but proposals for a city beach could inject even more colour into the mayoral elections."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
