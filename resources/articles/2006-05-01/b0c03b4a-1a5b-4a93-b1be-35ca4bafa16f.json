Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Angela Merkel, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Ismail Haniya, Ehud Olmert, Muqtada al-Sadr, Oprah Winfrey, Bono and George Clooney all made the cut, with 2005 repeats George Bush, Bill Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Bill Gates and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. There was a notable absence of Britons, including Gordon Brown, who made the American magazine's 2005 roster of world influence. In a series of essays on this year's winners, Zadie Smith's work is said to have \"established a model for how to make sense - and art - out of the complexity, diversity and pluck that have defined the beginning of this century\". A biography of Voltaire and works by Ali Smith, Ian McEwan and Andr\u00e9 Brink have made the shortlist for Britain's oldest literary award, revealed yesterday, honouring the best biography and work of fiction of the past year. Finalists for the James Tait Black Memorial Prizes also include Uzodinma Iweala and biographies of Horatio Nelson, Siegfried Sassoon and Edvard Munch. Given annually by the University of Edinburgh since 1919, they are said to be \"the only awards of their kind to be presented by a university\". The shortlist is selected by staff and graduate students. Past winners include DH Lawrence, Iris Murdoch, Evelyn Waugh and EM Forster. This year's winners will be announced next month. A Dutch tulip has been named after singer Katie Melua. The artist, who went platinum in Britain last year, has seen her album Piece By Piece become a huge seller in Holland. \"The people of the Netherlands love her,\" said Jan Huiberts, director of AG Rass, who helped cultivate the tulip. \"It is quite unexpected but really flattering,\" said Melua on the presentation of the white and pink Tulipa Crispa Roze, now renamed Tulipa Katie Melua. Past recipients of renamed Dutch tulips include Pink Floyd and Rembrandt. Vaughan Williams's Lark Ascending is the country's favourite classical work, according to a poll of 20,000 listeners by Classic FM. Elgar's Cello Concerto in E Minor and Variations on an Original Theme took second and third place respectively. The German-born baroque composer Handel - who became a British citizen in 1727 - was also prominent among the top 30 British pieces of classical music with the Messiah and four other works making the list. Other winning pieces included The Planets by Gustav Holst and The Armed Man: A Mass for Peace by Karl Jenkins, the only living composer to make the top 10. \u00b7 benjamin.joffe-walt@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
