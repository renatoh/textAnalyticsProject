Sure, you're segregated from your fellow passengers, asked to explain the derivation of your name ('Historically, I guess they turned things') and personally escorted by the staff to the gate to sit in pre-assigned seats, but it is a chance to bond with those in the same situation. As we sit in our cordoned-off section at Heathrow, the man next to me launches into a reverie: 'Jerusalem's too small, Eilat's a bit boring but Tel Aviv is a real party town,' he says. 'It's got everything, great bars, and shops and then there's the beach. Oh, and the women there ...' he adds after a short pause. Taking off his Ugg boots, he disappears behind a screen. Ah yes, Tel Aviv, embryonic contender for the role of Miami's Middle Eastern cousin. In winter, the weather is mild and sunny, the restaurants are fully fusioned and the nightlife goes on, well, all night. You can walk everywhere and the cakes are famously good, which is a handy combination, and in a sure shot to the slightly pretentious Wallpaper*-reading part of the soul, the city has the Unesco mark of approval for its unparalleled collection of modernist architecture. So, what's not to like? Well, for a start, Uri, my driver, who lives an hour away in Jerusalem, doesn't seem particularly happy. After my flight, I get to admire Tel Aviv's modernist architecture - austere, all-white villas and blocks of flats on wide leafy boulevards - while he tries and fails to find my aesthetically pure hotel. 'It's too small,' he says as we go round in circles. 'Most people stay in big hotels, why aren't you?' he adds, sounding very exasperated, while at the same time refusing to use a map. Eventually Alfonso, the night manager, guides us in by mobile phone. The Hotel Cinema, built in 1930, peddled celluloid dreams to the masses until the multiplex generation took hold. With its flat roof, white, curved concrete walls and sweeping terrace, it's a perfect example of Tel Aviv's International Style. And it is small, friendly and reasonably priced. Next morning, Carele, an insurance broker and volunteer guide, takes me off for a walking tour. The city was largely created in the 1930s, when some of the German-Jewish architects who belonged to the Bauhaus school moved to Tel Aviv to escape persecution and in the process created one of the most architecturally cohesive cities in the world. The only things people might consider adornments were introduced to provide shade against the fierce midday sun. 'No Italian columns, no stars of David, no Persian arches - this was the first architecture that didn't look back to history or religion for inspiration,' Carele says before we head down Rothschild Street in search of coffee and cake. Later on, we end up by the waterfront, down by the newly renovated Tel Aviv port. Once a redundant hangar, Namal House is now a Berlin-style warehouse space with monochrome-based fashion designers, cafe and the Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves female-orientated sex shop. 'It's the new Israeli-type here,' says Carele as we stop to have a juice at the Comme Il Faut cafe, it being at least 40 minutes since our last refreshment stop. 'They are slim, they wear the right brands and they don't smell because they wear the right deodorant,' he adds, before telling me that Tel Aviv and its blisteringly modern architecture is located on a fault line. 'Really?' I say. 'Oh yes,' he replies. 'I mean, as if we didn't have enough to worry about.' Still, the pink pound could always offer some salvation. Recently Tel Aviv has started to market itself to the high-spending gay travel market, leading one tourism official to talk excitedly about the fact that Tel Aviv needed 'an airlift of gays' who would appreciate its yearly gay pride marches, nightclubs and Mediterranean ambience. Unfortunately, my own mini-airlift had singularly failed to take off when my friend Matthew, after much deliberation, had declined to join me, preferring to spend the period between Christmas and New Year being the only gay in Mevagissey. Instead, I meet Tal Moshe when I gravitate towards his contemporary jewellery shop in the Dizengoff centre, a cheerful, slightly anarchic shopping mall near the Hotel Cinema. 'It's not easy being the only gay in the kibbutz, so we usually end up gravitating to Tel Aviv. It is the most gay-friendly city in the Middle East,' he says enthusiastically. Which is nice, but I can't help feeling that it's up there with the Jamaican bobsleigh team in terms of dubious achievements. The next morning, Carele picks me up and we go to the beach - an 8km stretch of prime Mediterranean sand. The religious beach, where the sexes take turns to bathe on different days, is next to the gay section. Further along, there's Chinky Beach, where Ibiza-style drummers gather on summer evenings. And at the end of it is Jaffa, the ancient port, now the city's most atmospheric quarter, where the majority of Tel Aviv's 14,000-strong Arab population live. Most large markets seem to act as social barometers and Jaffa's flea market is no exception. On the one hand, there are those who can see it as entertainment, rooting around the stalls looking for handmade soap and retro conversation pieces such as Demis Roussos albums, larger-than-life-sized bronze koalas and fake leopard-skin chairs. And on the outer edges are people, mostly Arab, trading for survival with a less desirable selection of vibrators (used), shaving brushes and Eighties television remote controls. Even this ancient outpost of the city has not resisted the tide of 'trendification' sweeping Tel Aviv. The Ottoman-built police station that overlooks the port at Jaffa is being turned into a boutique hotel. And there's the Abu Hassan cafe - owned by Arabs, beloved by everyone - and packed with people hoovering up houmous and fuul (broad beans with garlic and lemon) at Formica tables. Which Carele says is a must, even though we have just eaten. Thanks to aliyah, the urge to put down roots in Israel, Tel Aviv's restaurant options encompass everything from Danish cuisine to Yemeni soup restaurants. On Levinski Street, in the Florentine district, I go from an Iraqi grocery store to a Libyan delicatessen where Carele buys me a pot of quinoa with spices to tide me over until lunch, and then from an Argentinian bakery to a courtyard bar, called Elevator, which caters to Tel Aviv's boho set, with cocktails and mismatched furniture. I'm not sure Elevator's plastic flowers and general air of kitsch were exactly what Israel's founders had in mind, but the Florentine district seemed to be everything that the state of Israel should be - a cross-cultural haven from oppression. And yet, even in Israel's most cosmopolitan city, you can't escape the fact that one minute you can be discussing the finer points of burekas - a rather delicious cheese and spinach pastry - including a detailed lesson in how the delightful crispiness comes from caramelising the base beforehand, before being distracted by the fact that the stall owner has a pistol strapped to his back. I'd always assumed that tourism promoted dialogue and understanding between different nationalities, but in Tel Aviv, every conversation threatens to turn into an argument, only suppressed when I (a) can't think of a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and (b) remember that historically the British hadn't done much good in the region. Tentatively, I bring up the subject of the controversial concrete wall being built along the West Bank to keep hardline Palestinian suicide bombers out. 'It's not really a wall,' says Carele. 'There are plenty of gaps, but the media never show those.' An hour later he apologises for the fact that he won't be able to join me for dinner and an exploration of Tel Aviv's nightlife after all. Instead, I'm joined that night by Haya, who, since she retired, volunteers with Tel Aviv's tourist board. She's very nice, but I do rethink my plans for a hard night's clubbing. Instead, we head for Messa, Tel Aviv's trendiest restaurant. With a large dash of Ian Schrager, a soup\u00e7on of Philippe Starck, billowing white curtains and communal tables, it has a Kurdish chef who turns out dishes such as fish ceviche with lentils in a Japanese lemon marinade. I ask one of the staff which neighbourhood we are in, and after much furrowing of brows and consultation, there is consensus that this particular area - a series of warehouses on Haarbaah Street - is so up-and- coming that it doesn't actually have a name yet. Normally, a zeitgeisty fact like that would make me extraordinarily happy. As would the fact that Haya, a seventh-generation Israeli, had grown up in one of Tel Aviv's Bauhaus houses. 'It was no big deal back then,' she says in response to my enthusiasm, 'nearly everyone did.' I wanted to like Tel Aviv so much - how can you not feel benign towards a place that has found a place for Kipod, a combined tattoo parlour and coffee shop, with body piercing on the side? But Tel Aviv was proof to me, at least, that you can stay in an aesthetically pleasing hotel, spend an enjoyable morning ferreting around Jaffa's flea market, eat fabulous food in stylish restaurants and feel yourself to be in the avant-garde, and yet still not feel as if it's quite the right thing to do. Two weeks after I returned home from Tel Aviv, a suicide bomber attacked a crowded shopping centre near the bus station, injuring 15 people. The Miami of the Middle East?
