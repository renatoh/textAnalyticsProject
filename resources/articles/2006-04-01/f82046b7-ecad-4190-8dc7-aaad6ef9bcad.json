Answering trivia questions? Singing along to Duran Duran's Rio? Videogaming has come a long way since Space Invaders and Doom. It has finally hit the mainstream, driven by huge sales of \"casual\" games such as Guitar Hero, Buzz and SingStar. While sales of traditional videogames have been fairly flat, some of the biggest sellers of the past year have been games that appeal to everyone, not just the core 18-35 male audience. Until fairly recently, videogaming has been a generally male pastime, with consoles and PC gaming dominating. But the growth in popularity of casual games - puzzles and simple arcade games - over the past few years has been in stark contrast to the traditional market. \"If you examine the household penetration rate of home consoles over the past 20 years, you will see that it hasn't really risen from around 30%. All that is happening is that we are selling more consoles to the same people,\" says Robert Saunders, a spokesman for Nintendo. Console manufacturers have realised that widening the market is crucial, as each transition to the next generation takes its toll on publishers. Wedbush Morgan Securities' NPD preview of console software sales for last month suggests they were down 18% on last year to $445m. \"The gamers who are using the current kit have expanded far beyond the techy early adopters and trend followers into the mass market,\" says San Dromgoole, chief executive of Some Research. \"This more casual, less committed, gaming demographic have notably different needs from the hardcore boys that preceded them.\" Retro games The clearest manifestation of this new focus is the inclusion of Live Arcade in the Xbox 360. Arcade allows gamers to download casual puzzle and retro games that offer simplistic graphics compared with the latest 360 titles but are simple and enjoyable to play. \"Whole genres were disappearing from retail and publisher portfolios, including fun genres we all grew up with, like scrolling shooters, 2D platformers, puzzlers etc,\" says Greg Canessa, group manager of Xbox Live Arcade. \"Arcade enables game developers and publishers to develop games for much lower cost and time than a traditional game.\" Initial figures suggest that the service is popular - more than 4m items have been downloaded since the 360 launched - with titles such as Geometry Wars and Zuma proving that looks aren't everything. Many of these puzzles and games are available from the web for the PC, often for free. Canessa remains confident that the service can differentiate itself from casual game operators like Pogo. \"Live Arcade is the equivalent of the Sundance festival for games. It has opened up the console to small indie developers to develop and distribute innovative, intensely creative game titles.\" The other console manufacturers have been equally keen to appeal to the wider market. Nintendo appears to be basing its upcoming Revolution console around casual games. The controller resembles a TV remote control and is designed to be unthreatening to use. The vision behind the concept is sound. \"People who grew up playing games are now in their 20s and 30s, and have demands on their time,\" says Saunders. \"They require different types of games and may want family and friends to play with them, which requires a different type of videogame.\" The success of the tactile Nintendo DS - with its touch screen and microphone - shows that a market exists. For Saunders, the interface is key. \"Nintendogs, Donkey Konga, SingStar and EyeToy all have two things in common. First, success in the mass market with the casual gamer, and second, all have new and innovative interfaces and new ways to play.\" Then there is Brain Training, which has sold more than a million copies, mainly to older Japanese consumers who warmed to the cryptic puzzles and conundrums. But it is Sony, in particular Sony Europe, that has made the biggest strides in this area. More than 600,000 EyeToys - the innovative webcam peripheral that allows users to interact with the screen by waving their arms around - have been sold in the UK since its launch in July 2003. That's twice as many as a top-selling traditional title such as Need for Speed: Most Wanted. The quiz game Buzz has been a smash hit - more than 200,000 sold so far - and is already on to its second iteration after launching just before Christmas. And then there is SingStar, which lets you holler along to music from the past four decades. By appealing to both sexes and all ages - the 1980s edition sold in large numbers to the over-40s - the game has done much to boost the PS2's appeal. \"We were intentionally trying to reach a wider audience,\" says Paulina Bozek, senior producer for SingStar at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. \"This motivated us to focus on how we can fundamentally change some of the experiences, and many of the design decisions were specifically focused on how we can get everyone to play, and to play together.\" Short bursts The focus is on new forms of entertainment. \"Videogames have been perceived as something you do alone, but games like SingStar, EyeToy and Buzz work in the opposite way. They are specifically designed to be played socially,\" says Bozek. Kelly Sumner, chief executive of Guitar Hero's publisher, RedOctane, adds: \"Our attention spans are declining, and we're typically demanding games which can be played piecemeal. We want short bursts, but don't want to be short-changed\". Clearly, gaming needs to broaden its appeal to break out beyond the converted. Creating different types of games that don't involve complicated input or space vixens in a fantasy land is essential for growth. \"Just as the music industry offers classical, pop and jazz, and the film industry offers arthouse, sci-fi and the Hollywood blockbuster among its offerings, so the games industry should be creating titles and genres that appeal to as many people as possible,\" says Saunders. One of the most popular new games is Guitar Hero, a PlayStation 2 title that comes with a replica Gibson guitar peripheral. Players strum along to tracks from groups ranging from Black Sabbath to Franz Ferdinand. The game has been a huge success in the US - particularly, one imagines, with head tie-wearing dad-rockers. Sumner is clear why the game has done well: \"Too often, playing interactive entertainment is a solo pursuit. Guitar Hero, SingStar et al are almost as much fun to watch as they are to play.\" \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
