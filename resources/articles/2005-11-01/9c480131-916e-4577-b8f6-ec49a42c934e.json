A picture of Jean Charles de Menezes, the Brazilian electrician shot and and killed at Stockwell underground station on July 22, had been added to the Stockwell memorial garden mural, and it had not been properly authorised. \"I have been asked by local residents for action to be taken regarding the graffiti desecration of the Stockwell war memorial,\" wrote David Tomlinson in an email addressed to Dominic Busby, the Stockwell community safety officer. \"Above all, the spectacular war memorial (and the clock) are Stockwell's only defining features and nothing should happen to them to draw more adverse publicity to Lambeth. I therefore request that as community safety officer, you take urgent action to remove the current graffiti and to secure the site against further incursions.\" As acts of graffiti desecration go, this was pretty unusual because Brian Barnes, the man responsible for the incursion, is a pretty unusual graffiti artist. He is an MBE and a graduate of the Royal College of Art and as such is in the minority among the desecrating underclass. It is also probably the case that most graffiti take less time than the 16 hours and 20 minutes that Barnes estimates this one required. Barnes had been working on renovations to the mural all summer. In fact, he has been working on it since 1998 when he started the project, a memorial dedicated to local people who died in conflict and also a celebration of famous residents of the area. Barnes was commissioned to add the De Menezes portrait by the Stockwell Partnership, which sponsors urban regeneration initiatives and originally came up with the idea for the memorial. It stands about 400 metres from Stockwell tube station, which still hosts a makeshift shrine to De Menezes at its the entrance, as well as posters which - in a new initiative launched by the council - read: \"Welcome to Lambeth. No, seriously.\" While the mural had the backing of many of those who wished to commemorate de Menezes's death, members of the British Legion threatened to protest because he did not die in a war. There was a botched attempt to paint over the portrait in blue emulsion. Barnes cleaned it up, only for the council to take further action: they called in the Grimebusters team. Their remit, according to the Improvement and Development Agency, is \"to improve environmental quality issues within the borough, particularly with environmental nuisance\". The tribute to De Menezes was removed, but it must have been felt that parts of the mural representing Vincent van Gogh and Roger Moore as James Bond, sometime residents of the area, were less of a quality issue. Barnes finds the whole business a little surprising. \"I've done 32 years of painting murals like this around London. I'm not some yob. This is an innocent man who had been shot. His parents were coming to Stockwell. I thought it would be good to remember him.\" Meanwhile, at the weekly vigil held to commemorate de Menezes's death, feelings run higher. \"It's terrible they removed it, just terrible,\" says Dagmar Almeida. \"It's because it's meant to be a war memorial? Well, he is a kind of fallen soldier. He died because of the war on terror, didn't he?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
