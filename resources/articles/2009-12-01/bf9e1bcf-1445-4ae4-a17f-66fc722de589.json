The 18-year-old student from South Shields was the odds on favourite to clinch the title. Around 20 million people are expected to have watched him beat his rival 25-year-old Olly Murs, generating huge advertising revenues for ITV. He hugged his mentor, Girls Aloud singer and show judge Cheryl Cole, and said: \"I can't even speak, thank you so much everyone. \"I can't actually speak and I just want to say thank you to Cheryl, she's been an amazing mentor.\" Cole told him: \"I feel over the moon, I'm absolutely delighted. The right person won. I'm so proud of you. The north east are going to be going mad.\" Simon Cowell told McElderry he was \"gutted for Olly\" but \"thrilled for you because you're brilliant\". McElderry's single, The Climb, will be available for download from midnight and will be in shops on Wednesday, host Dermot O'Leary said. Tonight's show featured all 12 acts who made it to the finals take to the stage with Paul McCartney. Former X Factor stars JLS, Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke also appeared on the show. Bookmakers said McElderry was now the favourite to secure Christmas number one, with Ladbrokes cutting his odds of earning the top spot to 1/8. A Ladbrokes spokesman said: \"Joe is the toast of fans up and down the country. For weeks now he's looked like the only realistic winner and has justified his billing. Christmas chart success is virtually assured.\" William Hill said it now faced a \u00a31m payout on McElderry, including \u00a37,000 to his family members. A spokesman said: \"Cowell has killed us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
