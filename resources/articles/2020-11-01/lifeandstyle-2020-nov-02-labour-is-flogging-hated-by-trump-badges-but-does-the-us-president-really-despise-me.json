But does the US president really despise me?", "bodyText": "The Conservative party carpet-bombs me with begging emails, urgently needing \u00a325 to make Brexit happen or level up the economy or stop the dangerous Keir Starmer. I quite enjoy them, from a dadaist perspective. I enjoy imagining someone sitting at their desk, filling in their bank details because they think 25 of their earth pounds will make the slightest bit of difference to regional inequalities. Labour \u2013 specifically David Lammy \u2013 different story. One, I support the party\u2019s agenda, even if it\u2019s not always 100% solid on what that is. Two, Labour badgers me much less often. The other day, Lammy sent a mail asking everyone who might reasonably think Donald Trump hates them \u2013 presumably \u201cfat pigs,\u201d \u201cslobs\u201d and \u201cbimbos\u201d or, for brevity, all women, plus all races other than Caucasian, plus Sadiq Khan in particular \u2013 to buy a badge saying \u201cHated by Trump\u201d for \u00a38, most of which will be a donation to the Labour party. Stupidly, I found myself drilling in to the proposition. Wearing a badge is a big deal. It\u2019s not like a retweet \u2013 you have to be absolutely certain that you believe it. \u201cNuclear power, no thanks!\u201d? Sure. But would Trump hate me? I can imagine him sneering at the proposition. \u201cNo, I only hate A-list feminists and beautiful women and American liberals.\u201d I can sort-of imagine him parsing the difference between hatred and contempt, albeit in quite a ham-fisted statement full of capital letters (\u201cWhy would I HATE someone I would NEVER NOTICE?\u201d). The more I think about it, the more naive it sounds, the more I think progressives are just not mean enough for the fight they have got on their hands. After a while, I\u2019m on a flight of fancy about how different things will look for all of us, if this time next week the American left \u2013 also not mean enough \u2013 has prevailed anyway. I still don\u2019t want to wear the badge. But I will send Lammy eight quid. I like him. I don\u2019t care what he spends it on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
