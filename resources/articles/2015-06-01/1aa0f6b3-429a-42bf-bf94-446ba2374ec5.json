With England riding high in the Women\u2019s World Cup, this seems an ideal moment to launch a musical version of the 2002 footie film. Since it is once again directed by Gurinder Chadha, who also co-wrote the book with Paul Mayeda Berges, it is hardly surprising that it has the same exuberant cheerfulness as the film, and a similar tendency to offer easy solutions to difficult social problems. As in the film, the focus is on Jess, the 18-year-old footie-mad, Beckham-worshipping daughter from a Sikh family living in Southall, west London. Inevitably, Jess\u2019s passion for the game leads to a culture clash with her parents and forces her to disguise the fact that she has become a vital striker for the Hounslow Harriers. Jess\u2019s problems are paralleled by those of her friend Jules, battling with the prejudices about women\u2019s football of her mum, Paula, who has been turned from the primly conventional figure of the movie into a raucous, if solitary, sexpot. Chadha\u2019s production, Aletta Collins\u2019s choreography and Neil Austin\u2019s lighting between them neatly overcome the problem of putting football on stage: a strong female ensemble shows deft ball control and, whenever Jess takes a penalty, the crucial leather is turned into a soaring circle of light. Even if Charles Hart\u2019s lyrics \u2013 with phrases such as \u201cIf someone gets the glory, why shouldn\u2019t it be me\u201d \u2013 are no more than serviceable, Howard Goodall\u2019s score is delightfully eclectic. Goodall uses Punjabi rhythms to great effect in the wedding celebrations and the scenes set in Southall market, while deploying his skill at writing big choral numbers in the first-act finale, Just a Game. But the show\u2019s festive gaiety and liberal spirit also become a way of masking the big issues: rigid parental opposition to Jess\u2019s ambitions melt away as quickly as the snobbery of a Sikh family who don\u2019t want their son to marry Jess\u2019s lower-middle-class sister. As long as you accept it as a wish-fulfilling fairytale that scores more heavily after half time, the show is perfectly enjoyable. Miriam Buether\u2019s design ingeniously shifts from suburban sitting rooms to wooded parkland and there are very good performances from Natalie Dew as the determined but divided Jess, Preeya Kalidas as her vivacious sister, Lauren Samuels as the single-minded Jules and Sophie-Louise Dann as her man-hungry mum, who has one of the show\u2019s best numbers, There She Goes. As Jess\u2019s dad, a frustrated spin-bowler and victim of historic British racism, Tony Jayawardena combines physical bulk with effortless grace in a way that reminded me of the great Pakistani batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq. It may seem an odd comparison in a show all about football, but it\u2019s a reminder, like this feelgood musical itself, that the barriers we erect between sport and theatre are rapidly crumbling. At Phoenix theatre, London, until 24 October. Buy tickets from guardianboxoffice.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
