They looked out on a flame-red sky. The Upper Parting plant owned by Cleansing Service Group, the country's largest private waste business, was on fire, sending into the air fumes from 180 tonnes of mixed chemical wastes. Worse was to follow. The plant lies close to the banks of the Severn on a floodplain. A few days after the fire, the most severe floods since 1947 sent chemically contaminated water pouring into many homes. What happened then, and what has transpired since, has shaken the faith of residents of this rural community in the agencies charged with protecting their health and environment. Failing to get clear information and assurances, locals have taken matters into their own hands and set out to establish for themselves the degree of danger to which they had been exposed. They may not have come up with many answers, but their experience raises profound questions about the regulatory and investigatory systems on which we all depend. Sixty villagers were evacuated the night of the fire; more following the floods. Mayen Konarski who, with her husband and three children, lives in the house closest to the plant, had to wait almost a week before alternative accommodation was found - despite being told it was unsafe to stay at home. Like many others, she soon concluded from public meetings with the agencies responsible that no emergency planning had been done. \"If that was the best the authorities could do, thank God it wasn't a bigger incident with deaths,\" she says. \"Frankly, the left hand didn't know what the right was doing.\" Once the immediate crisis passed, deeper concerns emerged. Many villagers were experiencing unpleasant health symptoms: headaches, diarrhoea, breathing difficulties, a burning sensation in the mouth. At Maisemore, the village across the Severn closest to the plant, floods brought water from the plant into Lino D'Ambrogio's riverbank house. When his symptoms - diagnosed by his GP as chemical poisoning - persisted, he went to the health authority. \"I wanted to know whether it would affect my long-term health. The public health consultant couldn't make an assessment on that. They don't know.\" Ann Johnson and her husband, Alan, who live about 200 metres from the plant, were evacuated two days after the floods and spent a month in nearby hotels. She recalls: \"We all had orange wee, sore throats, headaches, tingling, funny fingertips - it's hard to describe. The doctor said he thought it was to do with the explosion because there were too many people with the same symptoms.\" Alan Johnson suffered breathing and kidney problems and spent six days in hospital. Doctors diagnosed \"viral pneumonia\", but could not trace a virus in the blood. They could not make a definite link between his condition and the explosion. Residents were not reassured, either, by attempts to deal with the environmental impact of the explosion. The clean-up was hampered because no full inventory of chemicals held at the plant was available to the emergency services, and floodingimpeded access for three weeks. Residents' concerns mounted as they witnessed drums floating in the floodwater, and the disposal of some undisclosed material by environment agency officials who had reached the site by boat. When the agency later revealed that its monitoring of the area - 17,500 tests on 500 samples - had not found any significant con tamination, locals were unconvinced, pointing out that no air samples had been taken during the fire. With a wide gap between their experience and the official line, local people set to work themselves. Retired GP Duncan MacNair conducted his own survey of villagers' symptoms, while Sandhurst resident David Eggleton arranged for hair samples from 200 residents to be sent to Surrey University for chemical analysis. The local rector, the Rev John O'Brien, compiled a report and sent it to the deputy prime minister and then environment secretary, John Prescott. Tewkesbury Conservative MP Laurence Robertson lodged a petition at Westminster calling for the plant's closure. And Saag - the Sandhurst and Area Action Group - was formed, with representatives from the parish councils of the eight affected villages. The community had long-standing concerns about the plant's safety, making frequent complaints about the \"Sandhurst smell\", which makes their eyes and throats sting. In 1997 \"purple rain\" fell on white surfaces in Maisemore. The environment agency started legal proceedings against CSG under the Environmental Protection Act, but dropped the case when the company admitted a \"duty of care\" offence and accepted a formal caution. Last autumn's explosion, says O'Brien, marked a watershed. \"We could no longer say something was waiting to happen, because it had happened.\" In the wake of the explosion and fire, the environment agency suspended CSG's licence to handle waste material on the site while it considered the plant's future. But in the months that followed, the community felt its suspicions of light-touch regulation were being confirmed. An agency audit in 1996 had identified a number of shortcomings, including the need for a risk assessment strategy. But by the time of the fire, few of the improvements had been made, while 56 licence breaches since June 1999 were noted. In their internal reports on the incident, the environment agency and health and safety executive (HSE) suggest that tougher enforcement, leading to prosecution, might have been appropriate, with the HSE recalling that in 1998 \"the company management had been less than frank in describing some of their more dangerous operations\". Residents also learned that CSG might be operating without the required planning permission. Gloucestershire county council is currently investigating whether its 1978 permission for the treatment of \"oily wastes\" at the site extends to the subsequent treatment of waste chemicals. Local disquiet turned to outrage when, in February this year, it emerged that CSG had been handling radioactive material. At a meeting with Saag only a day before this became known, CSG managing director Ken Pee told a questioner there was no radioactive material at the site. When the environment agency revealed that two drums of radioactive material had been discovered, Pee rang Saag chair Mike Moorhead to apologise for \"misleading\" the group. Residents became even an grier when they recalled that, months before, the agency had dismissed any possibility of radioactive waste. Clarifying the position to the Guardian, Pee points out that low-level radioactive material occurs naturally in the laboratory samples which his company takes in. He says this is an industry-wide problem, and that whether this radioactive material falls under the definition of toxic waste CSG is authorised to deal with is a moot point. Locals have been left with the impression that vested interests are militating against a full investigation. Saag spokesman George Sharpley says: \"Whatever they find wrong with CSG will rub off badly on themselves. They do have an interest in not finding too much wrong.\" Many, like Debbie Burgess, who chaired Maisemore parish council at the time of the fire, feel that independence is too much to ask of self-regulating agencies. \"There has to be a public inquiry,\" she says. \"The environment agency is also the policing agency. If they haven't done their job properly, why ask them to investigate themselves?\" The other side of the affair shows the agencies genuinely trying to do better. Sally Pearson, public health director for Gloucestershire health authority, says lessons have been learned and \"robust emergency response arrangements\" will be made in future. The authority did conduct a survey, and its findings that the physical and/or psychological health of \"a significant number of Sandhurst residents\" had been affected by the fire went some way to mollify the community. The authority says there is \"no current evidence of any long-term risk to health\" but is conducting a follow-up survey this month and has set up a community recovery group to improve communication between residents and agencies. The environment agency has conceded it could have done more on enforcement and has included in the second of two joint reports (with the HSE) to Prescott a national action plan to draw wider lessons from the case. Sharpley acknowledges that the agency has worked hard at communicating. \"They have gone out of their way to make themselves accessible,\" he says, \"but what has actually flowed down through the conduits of information has been very limited.\" Part of the reason may be that greater frankness could prejudice any legal proceedings the agency may take against CSG. A decision on whether to revoke the company's licence and prosecute will come in the autumn. Failing the plant's closure and a public inquiry, the community's other options include seeking a judicial review of the agencies' regulatory performance and taking them to the European Court. In some quarters, there is fighting talk. David Eggleton, who is making complaints to the agencies' ombudsmen on behalf of residents, insists the agencies are \"up against a very strong community\". But Saag member Mark Wardle points to the villagers' vulnerability. \"We're in a difficult situation. The only people who can help us are the environment agency. If we attack them too much, we're biting the hand that can help us.\" Answering back \u0095 The company's response \"For a number of years, CSG has worked very closely with the health and safety executive, agreeing such matters as a prioritised action plan. There was proactive consultation by Upper Parting management to ensure compliance with all relevant health and safety legislation and the adoption of best practices. CSG believes that, considering the unique capabilities of the plant within Gloucestershire and the surrounding counties, support of the principle of regional waste management self sufficiency is best achieved by the facility re-opening. CSG declines prospective business involving radioactive materials. The various producers had mainly classified the materials that subsequently proved to be radioactive as toxic in contravention of Section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The company has always been open and honest in its dealings with the regulators and continues to afford every assistance with the ongoing investigation into the cause of the unfortunate fire of October 30, 2000.\" \u0095 The environment agency's response \"Since it became responsible for regulating the site in 1996, the agency has placed great emphasis on involving and informing the community on matters relating to the site. The agency persuaded CSG to establish a local liaison group, regularly attended parish council meetings, consulted parish councils on its proposed modification of the licence to improve operations of the site during 1998-99 and circulated environmental monitoring results. A balance has to be made between improving controls through modification of the licence and through enforcement action. The agency gave priority to improving regulation of the site through the modification of a technically sub-standard licence issued by the predecessor body and, although formal enforcement action was taken against CSG for an incident involving the discharge of blue dye from the site in December 1997, the agency recognises that more could have been done on enforcement.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
