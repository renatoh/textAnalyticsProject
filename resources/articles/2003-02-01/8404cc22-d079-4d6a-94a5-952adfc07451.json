Gerrard was found guilty of violent conduct by an FA disciplinary panel on Monday, with Houllier's simmering sense of injustice at that verdict exacerbated by what he said was an offer from an unnamed FA official to find a means of releasing the 22-year-old for England's friendly. \"Somebody mentioned to me [at the hearing] that Steven could still play for the national team,\" said Houllier. \"They tried to say that the ban could start on February 17, two weeks after the hearing. \"That would mean he could play for England but it would also mean he would miss the Worthington Cup final against Manchester United. They said he had the option to start the ban then or now, but that is no real choice. My response was: 'No chance'. I will always put Liverpool first.\" Sven-Goran Eriksson has implemented a policy of not selecting players serving domestic bans and will now have to do without Gerrard for Wednesday's game against the Socceroos at Upton Park. The FA said yesterday it was unaware of such an approach to Houllier but it was standard practice for clubs to have 14 days in which to appeal against any ban. Gerrard, punished for a two-footed lunge on Everton's Gary Naysmith during December's Merseyside derby at Anfield, is due to serve the first game of his suspension this evening against Crystal Palace in the FA Cup fourth-round replay. He will also miss the Premiership matches against Middlesbrough and Birmingham. In Gerrard's absence Liverpool hope to include Dietmar Hamann for his first start in almost two months tonight. \u00b7Berti Vogts has included Celtic's Jamie Smith, 22, in his Scotland squad for the match against the Republic of Ireland at Hampden Park a week today.
