Pearce, who has spent some \u00a39m since taking over at the club five years ago, said he would withdraw his backing regardless of whether a buyer could be found, and went so far as to raise the spectre of Bristol dropping out of the professional ranks. \"I hope to sell the club to an individual or a consortium, but if no one comes in I will still withdraw my financial backing,\" he said. \"I said I would stay here for five years and I have kept my word. I want Bristol to remain one of England's top 12 clubs and I would bitterly regret it if they had to revert to amateurism, but it is up to others now.\" In contrast to the home side's worsening outlook, Leinster's garden looks rosy, especially as they will avoid Munster in the quarter-final draw thanks to London Irish's surprise win over Toulouse. There had been speculation that Leinster, who were already sure of a home draw in the last eight, would not be at their most combative. But it was clear in the opening minutes that the pride of the Lions dictated that victory meant everything, whatever the consequences. Bristol, who required a far-fetched nine tries and victory to pip Biarritz for the final runners-up place in the quar ter-finals, ran everything. But so aggressive were Leinster in the tackle that the home side turned over any amount of possession and long before the end ran out of ideas. \"We could have gone out there and tried to ensure that we did not face Munster,\" said the Leinster coach Matt Williams. \"As soon as they had defeated Gloucester we sat down as a group and resolved that we were going to go flat out to ensure we won and finished the group with a 100% record. We wanted to send out a message that we were not afraid of anyone. \"I told the players not to worry about the tables or the mathematics but to just win the game. I fancied that London Irish would beat Toulouse and for us to be the only side with a perfect record at the end of the group stage is a huge achievement.\" Leinster, who will now entertain Biarritz, knew what they had to do yesterday and, if they had problems in the tight which will need addressing if they are to make the final, they thought on their feet and used their defensive organisation to launch counterattacks which gave them a comfortable win despite being pinned in their own half for the majority of the match. With the Irish game struggling financially, pressure may be put on Leinster to switch the Biarritz tie from Donnybrook, which holds 7,000 spectators, to Lansdowne Road. But Williams said: \"We want to play at Donnybrook. We defeated Biarritz there 18 months ago and it is our home.\" Bristol's unlikely task quickly turned into the impossible dream and all they have left to play for now is to avoid relegation from the Premiership. They started the season with the lofty ambition of breaking into the top four but they remain in the bottom half of the league and have a rest this weekend after being eliminated from the Powergen Cup by Rotherham. Bristol needed a performance unlike any other yesterday but were 12 points down in 15 minutes, the second-row Aidan McCullen and the centre Brian O'Driscoll scoring tries against the run of play as Leinster showed a mental adroitness to go with their physical edge. The England wings Phil Christophers and David Rees eventually made pressure tell, but in between their tries the centre Shane Horgan touched down to keep Leinster in control. The second half proved pointless for Bristol in more ways than one. Leinster never relaxed their grip and McCullen's second try eight minutes from time confirmed what was already known: Munster were on their way to Leicester and the toast was to London Irish.
