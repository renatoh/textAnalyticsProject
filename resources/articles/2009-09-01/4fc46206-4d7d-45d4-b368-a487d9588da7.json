Away from home in a hotly anticipated, fierce derby he employed Gareth Barry alongside the Dutchman Nigel de Jong, shielding the defence. Ahead of these two, Stephen Ireland was instructed to supply the wide men, Shaun Wright-Phillips on the right and Craig Bellamy on the left. Carlos Tevez, declared fit, would not need to be instructed to work his socks off as the lone striker roving across the width of the 18-yard box. Tactics Although Ben Foster presented City with an equaliser, City had started well. Strong in midfield, with Barry alongside De Jong and Ireland just in front, the defence was always able to find a free member of the trio. Outnumbered, United's central midfield pairing of Darren Fletcher and Anderson had problems. At the same time, Wright-Phillips and Bellamy were progressive on the wings and kept an eye on United's full-backs when possession changed hands. Unquestionably, City's shape and balance was effective in the first period as they restricted United's attacking options and played tidily when they gained possession. Did it succeed? City failed because, when Antonio Valencia entered the game and United enjoyed a period of ascendency, they changed a well-balanced shape which was suiting them. Hughes was worried by United's more vibrant approach, so Ireland was ushered wide to the left, and Bellamy came infield to partner Tevez. Now Fletcher and Anderson were direct opponents to De Jong and Barry. City faded badly. They struggled to get hold of the ball, Wright-Phillips was denied service and Tevez became an onlooker. Major dangers Wright-Phillips showed speed and movement down the right, and pinned Patrice Evra back for long spells. While United struggled in the first period, De Jong excelled \u2013 he tackled, he intercepted, and passed with simplicity and authority. City's three-man midfield looked good enough to take the game, but when that was broken the team collapsed. Suddenly United's play was full of drive and vibrancy, and they supplied a string of crosses into the box. Weaknesses When City came under second-half pressure they struggled to deal with deep crosses. Shay Given made some wonderful, instinctive saves but his relationship with his back four seemed fragile. There was a general nervousness which was not apparent in the first period, and United simply won too many headers. Wayne Bridge and Micah Richards, the two full-backs, lacked composure at times. The centre-backs, Kolo Tour\u00e9 and Joleon Lescott, will be fantastic assets but clearly need time and games to gel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
