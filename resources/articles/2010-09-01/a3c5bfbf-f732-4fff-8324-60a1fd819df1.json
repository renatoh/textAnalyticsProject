Over three generations the Social Democrats have been in power for five years in every six, and remade a chilly nation on the edge of the world into a warm society. With its expansive childcare, world-beating public services and vanishingly low poverty rates, Sweden is held up by the left as the example to follow. Or rather it was. The Social Democrats lost power four years ago, and failed to win it back on Sunday, their first double defeat since the 1930s. The most immediate questions are for the Swedish left, but Sweden's rightward turn ought also to prompt reflection among progressives elsewhere in the world, whom it inspired for so long. The problems the Social Democrats ran into had specific features, but they are manifestations of a wider malaise. Immigration has been thicker and faster in Sweden than in most places, but it is not the only country where diversity and slump are straining solidarity. Just as the anti-minority Sweden Democrats broke into the Riksdag on Sunday, the intolerant right has recently been storming ahead in recent months in polities from the low countries to the Danube. Meanwhile, social democrats have been struggling badly, polling just 25% in last year's elections to a European parliament in which they once prevailed, and faring dismally in national votes over the past 12 months in both London and Berlin. In France and Germany there is now a flickering recovery, though chiefly as a result of the difficulties of centre-right incumbents. Hopes that the banking crisis of 2008 would immediately revitalise the left have proved as deluded as Marxist claims made amid the financial crisis of 1931. The withering of manufacturing and the unions it supports are familiar problems to the left across the industrial world, but what is particularly alarming for Labour in Britain is Fredrik Reinfeldt's success in sustaining a centre-right coalition to near-victory in Sweden while retrenching amid a slump. The left is enjoying the novelty of having Martin Wolf and Sir Samuel Brittan spelling out its urgent argument with great authority on the pink pages of the Financial Times. To see off Stockholm syndrome, though, Labour must also persuade a wider audience it can make the sums add up. In a closely argued New Statesman essay the pollster Peter Kellner steps back from the economic crisis and discerns a deeper problem of affordability with social democratic dreams. As the first baby boomers hit 65, there are cost pressures everywhere, but in the UK these are compounded by the exhaustion of a peace dividend which progressives have enjoyed ever since the second world war. Demobilisation funded Attlee's NHS; by withdrawing from east of Suez, Wilson boosted pensions; the last droplets of the cold war's thawing helped even warrior Blair to rejuvenate the welfare state. There will be little help next time \u2013 scrapping Trident is necessary but will not be enough to fund, to take just one pressing priority, improved elderly care. The Keynesian left must be resolute about the here and now, but any government will need a financial plan for distant horizons, a caveat Mr Wolf always adds. Some of the choices involved will not be pleasant ones. New charges in areas such as roads will be needed to protect free health and education, and new taxes. Later retirement is unavoidable. But there are radical opportunities too, particularly in restating the economic case for social investment and democratising policy. It is because Europe's social democrats ceded so much power to financiers that they now struggle to persuade Europe's electors that they can now make a difference. After 1931 it took Keynes five years to write up his theory, and it took Europe 15 years to even half-implement it. Social democrats cannot afford to wait so long for new thinking this time around."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
