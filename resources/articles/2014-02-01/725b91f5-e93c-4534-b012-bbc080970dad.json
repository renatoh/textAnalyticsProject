Instead it was a Russian-born Swiss national who twisted, turned and \"Yolo-ed\" his way to win gold and leave White out of the medals. Having amassed a $40m fortune and a string of endorsements White, now 27, has defined his sport for more than a decade as it has gone from cult pursuit to mainstream entertainment offering and Olympic highlight. But under floodlights at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park the man who was once known as the \"flying tomato\" was brought to earth by Iouri Podladchikov, a rival who competed for Russia at the 2006 Turin Games and is universally known in the sport as \"i-Pod\". Having landed his winning run, which scored 94.75 and included his signature \"yolo\" cab double cork 1440 \u2013 a flip that he invented and stands for You Only Live Once \u2013 Podladchikov went bezerk, exchanging high-fives with the crowd and officials. Afterwards, he said he had been yelling at the crowd in Russian and offered his own take on Sochi 2014's vaguely nonsensical \"Hot. Cool. Yours.\" slogan. \"It's not explainable how hard it was today. It just worked out. It's hot, cool and it's mine.\" US rider Danny Davis said: \"I think it's great the American public and the world now knows there are other snowboard riders besides Shaun White.\" A \"disappointed\" White said afterwards it was \"not my time\". He added: \"I hate the fact that I nailed it in practice, but it happens. It's hard to be consistent.\" After pulling out of the slopestyle event on the opening weekend of the Games, fearing that he could injure himself and put his halfpipe chances in jeopardy, White had characteristically been at the centre of the story off the snow. Before he won gold in Vancouver four years ago he took the day off and went kayaking, but he has cut a more pressured figure in Sochi. His Canadian rivals accused him of running scared after he joined other riders in criticising a halfpipe that had been affected by rising temperatures and slushy conditions. Even so, the 95.25 run he landed in qualifying would have been enough to win gold had he been able to repeat it when it mattered. But attempting to become the first US man to \"threepeat\" (win gold at consecutive Games), White ended his first run in the final yelling \"what was that\" after he first slipped and then hit the lip of the pipe as he landed. His second was better, featuring some characteristically ambitious tricks and the odd ragged landing, yet was still not good enough to make the podium. White has continually pushed snowboarding forward, transcending his sport as sponsors have funded him to build private pipes and develop new tricks, including the triple cork. But a new wave of younger boarders is now snapping at his heels. One of them, the 15-year-old Japanese schoolboy Ayumo Hirano, took silver with 93.5 on his second run to become the youngest ever Winter Games medallist on snow, pipping his 18-year-old compatriot Taku Hiraoka, who won bronze. That left the American team, who won a clean sweep of gold medals in the snowboarding slopestyle events, with no one on the halfpipe podium for the first time since the sport was introduced to the Olympics in 1998. \"We let America down. Sorry, America. Iouri shined bright,\" said a deadpan Davis afterwards. When he landed his winning run, a laughing Podladchikov rolled in the snow and high-fived everyone in the vicinity. Despite competing for Russia in 2006, he has not lived there for 14 years. His father, a geophysicist, left for Sweden and then the Netherlands before settling in Switzerland. For White, who now balances his snowboarding career with other interests that include playing guitar in a band called Bad Things, there is bound to be renewed speculation about his future. \"I will go and see my family and reflect,\" he said. \"I'm planning to go out and play some music and I have a tour to look forward to.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
