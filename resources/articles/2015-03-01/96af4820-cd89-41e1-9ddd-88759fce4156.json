The Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, announced last week that more than $680m in grants had been assigned to 964 organisations to run 1,297 programs under the strategy. The IAS is the result of more than half a billion dollars in cuts in the 2014 budget, and consolidates more than 150 Indigenous affairs programs and policies into five broad areas. Guardian Australia has spoken with numerous organisations who have lost all funding, had their usual annual budgets cut or had their budgets renewed at the same levels for 12 to 18 months. The chief adviser on Indigenous affairs, Warren Mundine, told the ABC there were $8bn worth of applications so he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d that many missed out. Wendy Morton, executive director of the Northern Territory Council of Social Services, said the sector was \u201cprobably the most uncertain it has ever been\u201d during her 10 years at the council. \u201cOur message to the government is this is not the area to make savings,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are other areas you can make savings and hitting those most disadvantaged, those most vulnerable and often those in poverty is not the area they should be seeking to save the money.\u201d Speaking in Darwin on Monday afternoon, Morton said organisations had already been scaling back programs over the past few months and had to make early decisions to cut programs to give staff warning. She pointed to the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency which has said it will soon be refusing to take on new clients. Many of those organisations who have been granted funding have received a reduced amount or funding for a short time \u2013 12 to 18 months secured, which Morton said was a \u201cmajor issue\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s all incredibly uncertain and it is very difficult; one: to keep staff when they don\u2019t know if they have a job in a year\u2019s time and for many they\u2019ll start looking for alternative employment; and two: what programs to begin with families. If you\u2019re going to get the most out of working with that individual family you need a consistency in the person working with them and to know that in 12 months\u2019 time or 18 months\u2019 time they\u2019re still going to get the support.\u201d The next step for successful applicants is to enter into negotiations with the federal government, but Morton said organisations needed to decide whether it was worth running the program on a smaller amount than that they applied for. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of a range of children and family programs which have also been cut across the territory,\u201d Morton said. \u201cThere\u2019s also been previous cuts over the last few months through the department of social security and those cuts have impacted on financial counselling, families and parenting programs, across a broad spectrum of services. \u201cThis comes on top of the territory government making significant cuts over the last two years, particularly in the children and family services. And young people in the territory \u2013 particularly Aboriginal young people \u2013 are the most vulnerable \u2026 and yet this is the sector we seem to be cutting the most.\u201d The Darwin-based Amity Community Services was one of the latest organisations to receive a knockback, for its volatile substance and alcohol and drug outreach service. The service cost $480,000 a year \u2013 20% of its budget \u2013 and it worked with police, youth services and the retail sector in addressing volatile substance abuse such as aerosol sniffing among local youth. The IAS knockback came at the cost of four jobs, two of them held by Indigenous people, the opposition spokeswoman Natasha Fyles said on Monday, and would put young people \u201cfurther at risk\u201d. \u201cThis is a key frontline service working hard to direct disadvantaged young people into treatment services and to get them to re-engage with their families, school or employment,\u201d Fyles said. Morton said as far as she knew no other organisation had picked up the service Amity was losing, although that had happened with other organisations. Scullion last week dismissed suggestions that frontline services had been cut. \u201cWe have been very mindful in making decisions as part of this funding round and remain committed to improve the lives of Indigenous people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Abbott government has committed $860m dollars in IAS funding to ensure this happens.\u201d The Macdonnell regional council said on Monday it was being allocated less than its previous annual budget to deliver an expanded service. A statement from the federal Labor senators Nova Peris and Warren Snowdon claimed Indigenous ranger and Caring for Country programs had also lost funding. \u201cBy defunding councils and Aboriginal organisations Mr Abbott is taking away the services and jobs Aboriginal people need to live in their communities, on their country, with dignity,\u201d Peris said. On Friday it was revealed the national peak body for Indigenous legal services will close in June, after it was not granted funding through the IAS. Fourteen Family Violence Prevention Legal Services branches maintained their funding, but only for 18 months. All seven state and territory attorney generals wrote to their federal counterpart, George Brandis, at the weekend warning that federal plans for legal assistance would set back moves made against family violence and Indigenous disadvantage by decades."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
