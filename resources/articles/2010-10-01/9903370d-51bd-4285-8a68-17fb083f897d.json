(9 October, page 5, Money) we said that one consultancy firm's estimate of the accrued liability for public-sector pensions was \u00a3993bn \u2013 equal, our piece added, to \"more than \u00a3150,000 for every man, woman and child in Britain today\". We meant more than \u00a315,000. \u2022\u2008A story headlined Tina Brown bids for Newsweek \u2013 and heads for showdown with arch-rival Huffington (8 October, page 26) included quotes from some commentators. The one from David Kuhn and the one from Nick Denton should have been attributed to a New York magazine blogpost by Chris Rovzar. The Guardian's editorial guidelines say: \"The source of published material obtained from another organisation should be acknowledged, including quotes.\" \u2022\u2008A graph with a story about a new Equality and Human Rights Commission report was meant to illustrate education data showing that girls and boys ineligible for free school meals did better in the 2008-09 GCSEs in England than those who were eligible (the latter being from low-income families). But yesterday's page 11 graph showed the opposite. A revised version plus more of the report's underlying data can be found at theguardian.com/news/datablog. \u2022\u2008Our review of the Stephen Petronio Company's performance of Petronio's latest work, inspired by Shakespeare's Tempest, referred to it as I Kiss the Air Before Me. That should have been I Drink the Air Before Me (Dance, 8 October, page 38). The Guardian's policy is to correct significant errors as soon as possible. Please give the date, page, or web link.
