It\u2019s not over. Those who hoped for a swift and emphatic repudiation of Donald Trump, and those who expected a repeat of his fast 2016 electoral college victory, were both left disappointed on election night. At the time of writing, key battleground states still hang in the balance, with both candidates retaining paths to victory. Biden has 224 electoral votes and Trump has 213 \u2013 a candidate needs 270 to win the White House. Days of counting \u2013 and perhaps recounting \u2013 may lie ahead. The inconclusive election result plunged the US into an even greater period of uncertainty, and one set to test the country\u2019s collective nerve \u2013 and the guardrails of its democracy \u2013 for potentially days or weeks to come. The first test of that nerve came quickly, with the president prematurely claiming \u2013 as had been feared \u2013 that he\u2019d effectively won the election, claiming states that have not been called and asserting Democrats were trying to steal the election. Shortly before 1am on Wednesday the president tweeted: \u201cWe are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!\u201d There was zero evidence of votes being cast after the polls closed but votes were still being counted \u2013 as is legal. Twitter, as it has done several times in the late stage of this campaign, almost immediately added a misinformation label to the tweet. He followed that tweet with a speech at the White House where he accused his opponents of trying to \u201cdisenfranchise\u201d his supporters and saying \u201cthis is a fraud on the American public\u201d. He said he would go to the supreme court and \u201c\u2026 we will win this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as far as I\u2019m concerned, we already have.\u201d The TV network I was watching on \u2013 NBC \u2013 cut in midway to try to correct his mistruths, pointing out some of the states he claimed he was winning in were still too close to call. Biden, likely anticipating this play, had come out earlier in the night, projecting confidence \u2013 both in his position and in the process. Speaking at a late night drive-in rally in Delaware, the Democratic nominee said: \u201cWe feel good about where we are. We really do.\u201d \u201cI believe we\u2019re on track to win this election.\u201d Biden emphasised the country had to wait until every vote was counted to determine the winner. I had hoped this edition of the newsletter would be the one to draw a line under this tumultuous election. But it\u2019s clear some of the most volatile and consequential moments still lie ahead. You can follow the latest developments on our liveblog throughout the evening. The big stories Trump has won the key battleground state of Florida, but others including North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania remain too close to call. Democrats looked set to retain control of the House but some disappointing early results cast doubt on hopes to take control of the Senate. You can read all the latest on what we know here. The Florida loss meant Biden\u2019s team was left looking for victory elsewhere in the US. Trump polled well in white, rural areas and pulled off a \u201cbloodbath\u201d in Miami-Dade county, home to 2 million Latinos, killing Biden\u2019s hopes in the state. The first supporter of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory has won a US House seat. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican businesswoman, was declared the winner in Georgia\u2019s 14th congressional district. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, two members of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d of Democratic congresswomen of colour, led the way in securing re-election to the House on Tuesday. Despite pre-election anxiety, Tuesday was largely a day of peaceful voting with only sporadic reports of incidents of intimidation or misinformation or technological problems with voting machines. A nationwide push to relax drug laws scored significant victories on Tuesday as two states voted to legalise marijuana and Oregon became the first state to decriminalise the possession of small amounts of hard drugs. A federal judge on Monday dismissed a Republican-led petition to throw out 127,000 ballots cast at drive-through voting sites in Texas, the latest in a string of attempts by the party to cast doubt over the validity of drive-through and mail-in voting. Quote of the day Keep the faith.\u201d Biden\u2019s closing message to supporters during his late night address. Election views \u201cAs they wait for the results, Americans need to take a cue from the Brits: keep calm and carry on,\u201d writes Jill Filipovic. Trump may seek to claim the election prematurely, and exploit people\u2019s desire for closure. \u201cThe only bulwark against that is steadied stamina, and willingness to wait.\u201d \u201cTrump desperately wants to retain the presidency \u2013 not to \u2018keep America great\u2019 but to protect himself from future prosecution,\u201d writes Samer S Shehata. \u201cIf Trump loses the election, there may be calls to investigate and prosecute him for possible crimes involving obstruction of justice, violating the emolument clause of the constitution, and/or tax fraud, among others.\u201d Video of the day Here\u2019s Biden\u2019s late night speech to supporters in Delaware, where he sought to buoy hopes amid confusing and inconclusive results. Around the web \u201cEarly returns revealed no winner but affirmed the persistence of national fissures, as Democrats who had indulged in fantasies about the instant catharsis of a sweeping victory were left once more to wonder if they understood America as well as they had assumed.\u201d An excellent piece of analysis in the NYT. There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know but one thing is clear \u2013 the Democrats burned through an eye-watering amount of money on failed Senate races. The Daily Beast calls it a \u201chistoric squandering\u201d of resources. A good breakdown of exit poll data here on the Washington Post with some interesting trends \u2013 Biden favoured by independents, Trump ahead with those who made a decision in the last week.
