The Spaniard, who won the French Open title with his compatriot and unrelated namesake in 2016 \u2013 beating the Bryan brothers in the final \u2013 and was the singles champion here two years ago, declined to comment on the story. It first appeared on Tuesday in El Confidencial, a respected Spanish digital newspaper, then was repeated across social and traditional media outlets. Sources close to the player said he strenuously denied any suggestion that he and Marc L\u00f3pez were even aware that their surprise loss to John-Patrick Smith and Matt Reid, unseeded Australians, had subsequently aroused the suspicions of the Spanish police. Smith, ranked 81 in the world in doubles at the time, and Reid (76) beat the 11th seeds 3-6, 7-6 (2), 6-2, 6-4. Feliciano L\u00f3pez had previously withdrawn from the singles draw with a leg injury. Murray\u2019s camp, meanwhile, confirmed on Tuesday afternoon they were aware of the newspaper stories, but also declined to comment \u2013 as did the Tennis Integrity Unit, which knows about the claims. The allegations centre on the monitored activity of two retired 38-year-old Spanish footballers, Ra\u00fal Bravo, who played six times for Leeds on loan from Real Madrid in 2003, and Carlos Aranda, a La Liga veteran of several clubs. They have also been named in investigations into alleged match-fixing in football, according to El Confidencial. The report said: \u201cInvestigators conducting Operation Oikos reveal that information was passed on about a doubles match involving Feliciano L\u00f3pez and Marc L\u00f3pez at Wimbledon in July 2017, which presumably would be for the purpose of making illegal bets. \u201cThe police got the information from listening to Aranda\u2019s phone. He said: \u2018I have information about a match, do you want it?\u2019 The other speaker said: \u2018Yes man, of course \u2013 if you have it.\u2019 \u201cAranda demanded the contact committed to paying him 50% of all his winnings as payment for the tip, who asked how much he should put on. Aranda said: \u2018As much as you want, it\u2019s Wimbledon!\u2019 \u2013 the idea being that the tournament is so big, no one would be surprised by a huge bet. \u201c\u2018What Feliciano L\u00f3pez and his partner will lose is the doubles,\u2019 was the tip. [They] then lost to Matt Reid and John Patrick Smith, winning the first set before losing the following three.\u201d Feliciano L\u00f3pez and Murray are old friends on the circuit, and the Scot\u2019s coach, Jamie Delgado, made the first overtures about playing together at Queen\u2019s. \u201cHe spoke about the possibility of playing here with Andy,\u201d L\u00f3pez said earlier in the week, \u201cand of course my answer was yes. For me, it\u2019s a great opportunity to share the court with a great player, with a great friend, as well. I hope it\u2019s going to be a good week for us.\u201d Lopez was due to play singles in the Fever-Tree Championships on Tuesday against M\u00e1rton Fucsovics but, like the rest of the card, the match was washed out. Play was abandoned shortly after 5pm. Had he played, L\u00f3pez would have been obliged to attend a press conference \u2013 and it is unlikely the questions would have strayed far from the match-fixing allegations. However, a source close to the player asserted on Tuesday evening that L\u00f3pez was angered by the story and had been in long discussions with his lawyers. Marc L\u00f3pez told Spanish newspaper AS: \u201cThey have no right to dirty our names like that.\u201d As rain ripped through the Queen\u2019s schedule, with more rain forecast, Murray\u2019s comeback, scheduled for Wednesday, has been pushed back to Thursday, to allow L\u00f3pez a chance to play his singles. Murray, still searching for a doubles partner at Wimbledon \u2013 which starts 1 July \u2013 will play with the 35-year-old Brazilian Marcelo Melo at Eastbourne next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
