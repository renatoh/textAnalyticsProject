Independent research agency Vanson Bourne was commissioned by IT company Infosys (which as a seller of an AI platform has a vested interest in promoting such technology) to poll 1,600 business leaders of companies with more than 1,000 staff and at least US$500m in annual revenue across Australia, China, the United States, Germany, France, India and the UK. According to the survey, released at the World Economic Forum last week, major Australian businesses invested an average of $7.9m last year in AI, behind only the US, but placed last in both the skills required for AI takeup and in plans to integrate AI. The Infosys Australia regional head, Andrew Groth, told the Guardian the survey demonstrates that Australia risks becoming uncompetitive. \u201cThe challenge is the skills situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf not addressed, [our] level of competitiveness could be a challenge, as all companies adopting AI are seeing advantages. We are all competing on the global stage. It\u2019s here and we need to address these challenges.\u201d The survey found 23% of Australian business leaders believe their company completely lacks the skills needed to capitalise on AI. Groth said AI requires proficiency in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) skills, digital proficiencies, creativity and problem-solving, as well as ongoing learning. He said the lack of skills was relevant to another of the survey\u2019s findings \u2013 that Australian business leaders are the most likely to be planning to make workers redundant rather than reassign those whose roles have been made obsolete by AI technology. Two-thirds of Australian businesses polled said they plan to or already have replaced jobs with AI, with a third of those leaders saying the affected workers will be made redundant. Groth was keen to focus on the two-thirds of businesses that intend to reassign rather than sack those in jobs better done by AI. He cited as an example the Fiona Stanley hospital in Perth, which last year brought in an automated pharmaceutical ordering system that utilises robots which scan, move and store $200,000 worth of drugs daily, with the workforce previously responsible reassigned to other tasks. \u201cUsing [artificial intelligence] reduced stock availability outages by 70% and freed up nurses for patient care rather than admin of stock,\u201d he said. AI is even impacting on Infosys\u2019 own global workforce. Groth said between 8,000 and 9,000 jobs had been automated at the company over the past year, but almost all affected employees were given other roles within the company. Infosys\u2019 human resources head, Krishnamurthy Shankar, has conceded that, over time, improved AI capabilities will see the company hire less new employees. A 2015 Ceda report found 40% of Australian jobs were under threat from automation. But University of New South Wales professor of AI, Toby Walsh, said that figure was unlikely as as many new jobs would be created as eliminated by automation. He said the jobs wipeout would be felt most by entry-level workers. \u201cWe are already seeing the beginning of that trend; companies are not making the difficult decision of letting go of employees, but instead are avoiding bringing in new young workers to fill positions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t have to mean less prosperity however. If machines create more wealth, it is just a matter of distribution. \u201cOne popular idea is a universal basic income, for which there are experiments in a number of countries, but that is not the only lever \u2013 there could be taxations on corporations and the very rich. Or there\u2019s no fundamental reason the weekend has to be two days\u2019 long \u2013 making it three days would ease the jobs shortage.\u201d For the jobs that are safe from automation, AI will still have an impact in improving efficiencies in our professional and personal lives. Commissioned by AI personal assistant firm Julie Desk, Censuswide carried out another industry-funded survey across the UK in November/December and found 47% of professionals were willing to hand responsibility for scheduling meetings, booking restaurants and other administrative tasks over to AI personal assistants. The survey of 1,000 people indicated a generational gap in terms of trust in an AI personal assistant \u2013 nearly 62% of respondents aged 16 to 24 said they would trust an AI for handling the back and forth emailing of such tasks compared with 35% of those aged 55+. The survey indicated roughly two hours a week would be saved by automating such tasks, with respondents saying they would redeploy this time to pursuits such as taking care of their family (24%), going shopping (21%) and making love (20%)."}, "isHosted": false}}}
