Soviet-born operator thrust into Trump impeachment scandal", "bodyText": "Has he delivered the most devastating blow yet to Donald Trump\u2019s defence? Or is he merely a desperate man trying to save his skin? Lev Parnas is the latest obscure figure to find himself thrust centre stage by the impeachment of the US president. A close associate of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Parnas on Wednesday added to evidence that Trump personally directed an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate one of his political rivals. \u201cPresident Trump knew exactly what was going on,\u201d he said in a televised interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Wednesday. \u201cHe was aware of all my movements \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president.\u201d The interview took place even as the House of Representatives transferred articles of impeachment to the Senate ahead of Trump\u2019s trial. But who is he \u2013 and can he be trusted? Lev \u2013 the name means \u201clion\u201d in Russian \u2013 Parnas was born in February 1972 in Odessa, Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. His family moved to America when he was three, first to Detroit, then to New York. When Parnas was 23, he settled in Florida. He co-founded a company called Global Energy Producers and, in 2013, another named Fraud Guarantee \u2013 reportedly so he could bury Google search results about a history of debts and court judgments against him. Parnas had little interest in politics until Trump ran for president. Parnas attended his campaign rallies and became a donor. \u201cParnas told me that he \u2018bumped into\u2019 Trump \u2018plenty of times\u2019 at events in New York over the years, but that they didn\u2019t get to know each other until the 2016 campaign,\u201d Adam Entous of the New Yorker reported. After Trump\u2019s shock win, Parnas became closer to Giuliani and worked on his behalf to collect dirt on Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in Ukraine \u2013 which became the core of the impeachment inquiry that could lead to Trump\u2019s removal from office. Parnas told the New Yorker: \u201cBecause of my Ukrainian background and my contacts there, I became like Rudy\u2019s assistant, his investigator. I don\u2019t do anything on my own. I don\u2019t lobby people. I go get information. I set up a meeting. I make sure that the call went right. I make sure the translation is done right.\u201d Documents released this week suggest that Parnas was also involved in monitoring the movements of Marie Yovanovitch, who was ambassador to Ukraine until Trump abruptly recalled her last May. Ukraine said on Thursday it has launched an investigation into alleged illegal surveillance of Yovanovitch. Yuri Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general, said in an October interview that he and Parnas met for the first time with Giuliani in New York, and then later in Warsaw. Parnas became his main contact for the group, and they regularly exchanged SMS messages with articles from Ukrainian and US media. \u201cIt seemed to me that they were close to Giuliani and they really tried to help him with finding information about issues Mr Giuliani is interested in,\u201d Lutsenko said of Parnas and his business partner Igor Fruman. Lutsenko claimed he was not the one who set Parnas and Fruman and Giuliani against Yovanovitch. \u201cGiuliani and especially these two guys [Parnas and Fruman] told me they are against [Yovanovitch] as an ambassador long before our meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cI never asked for any activity against her \u2026 I never asked for any deal on this point.\u201d \u201cI find this story very funny. How could two American businessmen dismiss the ambassador?\u201d he said in the October interview. \u201cHow could Mr Giuliani dismiss an ambassador?\u201d After their meeting, he said, Parnas began asking for help organising other top-level meetings in Ukraine. \u201cHe asked me after our presidential elections to help with meeting the newly elected president [Zelenskiy], but I told him that it\u2019s impossible for me to help,\u201d said Lutsenko. \u201cWe exchanged some newspaper and mass media articles, but nothing else. I never shared legal materials with them. We never spoke about their business, I don\u2019t even know what business they\u2019re in.\u201d Last October Parnas and Fruman were arrested as they tried to flee the US. They were indicted on charges of conspiracy, making false statements and falsification of records and ordered to turn over key documents to congressional investigators. Prosecutors allege they made outsize campaign donations to Republican causes after receiving millions of dollars originating from Russia. Parnas and Fruman have pleaded not guilty. Trump said last year: \u201cI don\u2019t know those gentlemen. I don\u2019t know what they do. Maybe you will have to ask Rudy.\u201d But numerous photos show Trump and Parnas together. Photos released from Parnas\u2019s phone this week show him not only with Trump but his son Donald Jr, daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner. Parnas told Maddow on Wednesday: \u201cI mean, we\u2019re not friends. Me and him didn\u2019t watch football games together. We didn\u2019t eat hot dogs. But he knew exactly who we were. He knew exactly who I was, especially because I interacted with him at a lot of events.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
