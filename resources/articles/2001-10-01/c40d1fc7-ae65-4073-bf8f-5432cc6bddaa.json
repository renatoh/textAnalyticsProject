The advice I'm after is: what is the best way of getting from the mainland (either Vladivostok or somewhere in China) to Japan or South Korea. Will I encounter any difficulty in doing this? Neil Callen, London The pure trans-Siberian journey, from Moscow to Vladivostok, was once seen as the best way to go overland to Japan. Now the once-weekly ferry service from far-eastern Russia to nearby Japan has become unreliable and infrequent, and regular air travel out of the port city has become less common, the advantages of avoiding it have become numerous. Taking the Trans-Mongolian train via Ulan Baatar to Beijing, with onward connections to Shanghai, is one of the world's acclaimed rail trips. From Shanghai, there are weekly sailings to Osaka and Kobe in Japan. Sailing schedules to coincide with the World Cup aren't available yet, but the Japan National Tourist Office (020 7734 9638) will have details when they're known. The companies that operate these trips are the China-Japan International Line and the Shanghai Ferry Company The tourist office can give full contact details; fares start at around \u00a3120. For Korea, there are boats from Shanghai to Inchon, a subway ride from Seoul. Contact the South Korean Tourist Office (020 7321 2535). Weekly services take about 40 hours and cost from \u00a350. Either journey shouldn't be a problem if you book in advance, though will be very busy around World Cup time. Currently, stays for tourists of up to 90 days in both South Korea and Japan do not require a visa. The Russia Experience (020 8566 8846) offers overland rail packages from Moscow, with boat connections to Japan. Cuban independence My partner and I are planning to visit Cuba in May and want to spend a week travelling independently, staying at Casa Particulares. Can you advise us on whether it is necessary to pre-book or not, if there are directories (print or electronic) which list/recommend places and any other tips on making the most of this accommodation. Also, advice on car hire in Cuba would be appreciated; prices, hire companies, insurance requirements and any pitfalls to be avoided. John van Loo, Sheffield Bearing in mind that you are required to have your first three nights booked upon arrival in Cuba, even though this isn't always enforced, it's a good idea to do some booking in advance. In most cases though, you can phone ahead or simply pitch up, ask to have a look round the room and see if you like it - if not, there are plenty of options in most places. Good sources of information on casas include the listings in Lonely Planet Cuba, and the Web site http://users.pandora.be/ casaparticular Hiring a car is a great way to get around, but it isn't the cheapest - you can easily end up spending \u00a360 a day. If you're aiming to see a lot of the provinces, try to get a deal that includes unlimited mileage. Havanautos and Transtur are good companies to deal with as they have large numbers of branch offices around Cuba. Insurance is not included, and there are two types of cover available. The cheaper plan covers accidents but not theft, the dearer one is more comprehensive. Keep the name of the person you rented the car from with you, and make sure you keep hold of the rental agreement. Theft from vehicles can be a problem, park your car in a well-lit place. Honeymoons We're getting married in April and have arranged to have a month off work for our honeymoon and are thinking about where to go. We want somewhere sunny, a bit of adventure and to learn how to scuba dive but we're not sit-on-the-beach types. Any recommendations? Neil Middleton, London A lot of honeymoon destinations offer lovely beaches and nothing else - so even with the love of your life by your side, dare we say it, you might end up a little bored. Egypt, however, is a fantastic destination and has plenty to offer in the 'holiday of a lifetime' stakes. The average temperature in April will be around 28C so it won't be so hot that sightseeing becomes unbearable. Cairo is a bustling city and many travellers find that they can only stay for a few days at a time. Despite the frenetic lifestyle there are still plenty of romantic interludes to enjoy - seeing the pyramids at dawn or experiencing a sunset felucca ride both rate as highlights not to be missed. In contrast to the chaos of the city, the best way to observe life (as well as many of the attractions) is by boat. If you can afford it, it's definitely worth considering a Nile Cruise. UK-based Abercrombie &amp; Kent (020 7873 5000) and Cox &amp; Kings (020 7873 5000) both run luxurious boat trips through Aswan, Luxor and the Valley of the Kings with numerous packages available. A six to seven-day, all-inclusive trip starts at around \u00a31,000 per person. Surrounded by deserts on three sides the Red Sea is a divers' paradise. Popular dive areas include Sharm el-Sheikh and Na'ama Bay and Dahab. There are lots of diving courses and day trips and budget accommodation is easy to find. Talk to other travellers for helpful tips on best value places. The Foreign &amp; Commonwealth office advises tourists to be vigilant during their stay but are not aware of any specific threat to British nationals.

We are 82 and 76 and want to stay in one place and do gentle coach trips to all the sights. I expect b&amp;b would suit us best in somewhere like Arles or Avignon. Please help us find the right travel agent. Leonie Acquah, London We had a lot of trouble finding an operator that did eight-10 day trips to Provence as many companies have not yet finalised their itineraries for next season. The French Government Tourist Office (09068 244123) carries an exhaustive list of agencies so you're sure to find someone who can help eventually. One company that you might want to consider is Mondoramas (00 33 493 71 74 97). It can organise a personalised driving tour with three-star accommodation, transportation by deluxe minivan and an English speaking driver/tour guide. An eight to 10-day break in May, based on two people sharing, costs \u00a3792 per person. Another possible idea comes from Travelsphere Holidays (0800 191418) which offers a 10-day, two-centre escorted tour of Provence and the Italian Riviera from just \u00a3299 per person. You'll spend three nights near Nmes, three in Pietra Liguria on the riviera, with overnight stops there and back in Dijon plus optional excursions. \u00b7 We welcome letters. Tom Hall and Rachel Suddart from Lonely Planet answer as many as possible here. Include a daytime telephone number and postal address.
