And if, God forbid, you should stay tuned for long enough, you would discover that little tweaks to the rules \u2013 about whether the price ticks up or down with the clock, and whether all shoppers end up paying the same or not \u2013 affect the viewers' psychology and calculation about what to spend. Serious economists would agree that the framing of bidding wars is all-important \u2013 and the consequences of their so-called game theories can affect weightier things than matching his'n'hers towel sets. This was seen when Gordon Brown set the pointy-heads to work to devise the best way to flog off 3G mobile spectrum. The results were spectacular \u2013 the simultaneous ascending auction that they settled on raised about \u00a322.5bn from the telecom companies through the sale of thin air. This week, however, when George Osborne tried the same thing with new 4G spectrum, proceeds came in at \u00a32.3bn \u2013 a billion less than expected, and a mere 10th of last time. The first thing to say about this result is that it is a shame. The phone companies are naturally pleased not to be stumping up any more, but more striking yesterday was Ofcom's suggestion that the cut-price sale was a win for every phone user, since the savings would be invested in innovation or handed back in lower bills. Don't bank on it. The award of planning permission can result in a windfall for a landlord, but that does not oblige him to discount the house that he goes on to build, and the academic theory does not suggest that things will necessarily be any different with the corporate windfalls produced by unexpectedly cheap spectrum. The second thing to be said is that the disappointing result was probably unavoidable. However deftly the rules of the auction were devised, bigger forces had intervened since 2000 \u2013 notably the dotcom bust and the great recession. Mr Osborne's critics cannot pretend that a different chancellor would have secured more. They must also concede that the \u00a31bn hit to the public finances is small beans, seeing as it is a one-off hit as opposed to a recurring cost. The chancellor is, however, damaged in another respect. He has fetishised the reduction of the deficit above everything else, and in his autumn statement claimed that this was continuing despite the fresh slowdown. That claim turned upon some dodgy accounting with the Royal Mail pension scheme, and by banking \u00a33.5bn from 4G sale. That cash has failed to come in. It is not in itself a disaster for the economy, but it does expose the disastrous hollowness of a strategy which puts the deficit first and considers growth only second."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
