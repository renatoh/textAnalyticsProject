Days after militia leader Ammon Bundy, now in jail in Portland, Oregon, called on the final four occupiers at the Malheur national wildlife refuge to surrender and go home, the elder Bundy sent a letter to government officials declaring that the armed militia would not be backing down. \u201cThis is notice that We the People of Harney County and also We the People of the citizens of the United States DO GIVE NOTICE THAT WE WILL RETAIN POSSESSION OF THE HARNEY COUNTY RESOURCE CENTER,\u201d Cliven wrote in the letter, which he sent on Monday to the local sheriff, Oregon governor Kate Brown, and the White House. The armed militia in Oregon renamed the federally protected refuge the \u201cHarney County Resource Center\u201d and for weeks since the occupation began said their goal was to return the public lands to the control of local people. But since 11 people associated with the militia were arrested \u2013 and occupation spokesman LaVoy Finicum was shot and killed by state troopers \u2013 leader Ammon Bundy has called on the holdouts to end the protest. Cliven Bundy, however, declared today that he wants the opposite to occur. \u201cWhat this is saying is that Cliven Bundy is taking control of things,\u201d Cliven said in an interview from his ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada, on Monday afternoon. \u201cIf we don\u2019t retain it, then we\u2019ve lost everything that we\u2019ve done in the last two months. We\u2019re not gonna give up.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is not Ammon\u2019s message. This is my message ... We\u2019ve made a decision to retain it ... The feds are going to get out of there.\u201d The letter demands further: \u201cRemove all federal and state policing agents out of Harney County.\u201d Cliven said he suspected that his imprisoned son felt pressured to urge the remaining occupiers to go home. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said, but I never believed it. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s in his heart. He probably got his arm twisted.\u201d Cliven said he has not talked to his son since he was arrested last Tuesday. Ammon, his brother Ryan, and a group of activists are facing federal felony charges for their roles in the occupation of government buildings, which began on 2 January to protest the imprisonment of two local ranchers. Carol Bundy, Cliven\u2019s wife, said in an interview that it was crucial the occupation persevere. \u201cAmmon does not want bloodshed. But he wants the message to continue,\u201d said Carol. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a statement. We\u2019ve made a stand. And we\u2019d like to hold out.\u201d The four remaining occupiers have posted videos online saying they refused to leave unless they had assurances that they would not face charges. The four left are David Fry, a 27-year-old Ohio resident, Jeff Banta of Elko, Nevada, and husband and wife Sean and Sandy Anderson of Riggins, Idaho. Speaking through his lawyer after his first court appearance last week, Ammon issued a statement that said: \u201cTo those who remain at the refuge, I love you. Let us take this fight from here ... Please stand down. Go home and hug your families. This fight is ours for now, in the courts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
