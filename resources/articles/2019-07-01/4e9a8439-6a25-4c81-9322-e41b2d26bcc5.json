He was due to turn 28 on 13 July. Police in Southlake, Texas, responded to reports of an unconscious man in a hotel room on Monday morning. Skaggs was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious. \u201cIt is with great sorrow that we report Tyler Skaggs passed away earlier today in Texas,\u201d an Angels statement said. \u201cTyler has, and always will be, an important part of the Angels Family. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Carli and his entire family during this devastating time.\u201d Skaggs, who was from the Los Angeles area, was selected by the Angels in the first-round of the 2009 draft. He was later traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks but rejoined the Angels in 2013. He was having one of the best seasons of his career in 2019 and was part of the team\u2019s starting rotation. Skaggs was picked by the Angels in the same draft as his teammate Mike Trout. Trout paid tribute to Skaggs in a tweet on Monday evening. \u201cWords cannot express the deep sadness we feel right now,\u201d wrote Trout. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with Carli and their families. Remembering him as a great teammate, friend, and person who will forever remain in our hearts... we love you, 45.\u201d The Angels cancelled Monday night\u2019s game against the Rangers.
