The post had offered parents tips on how to discuss \u201cwhite privilege\u201d with their children. The post acknowledged that, while the charity\u2019s white service users faced \u201cinequality and disadvantage\u201d on a daily basis, service users from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds faced additional challenges due to the colour of their skin. Drawing on news articles and research, the blogpost went on to explain the meaning of the term \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and to discuss the systemic racism faced by BAME people in the UK, while insisting that: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that, as a white person, you haven\u2019t worked hard for what you have, or that you haven\u2019t suffered.\u201d On Friday, 12 Conservative MPs wrote to Barnardo\u2019s chief executive, Javed Khan, expressing their \u201cconcern and disappointment\u201d at the blogpost. The MPs claimed that the term \u201cwhite privilege\u201d did \u201cgreat damage to the cause of the poor and marginalised\u201d. They described the post as \u201cideological dogma\u201d and \u201cdivisive militancy\u201d, and said they had asked the chair of the Charity Commission to investigate the post. The MPs were from the Common Sense Group, 59 MPs and seven members of the House of Lords who are committed to promoting a \u201ctraditional Tory view\u201d on immigration and working against \u201cthe woke agenda\u201d. Barnardo\u2019s vice-president, Dr David Barnardo, hit back at the letter, saying the charity was \u201cas committed as ever to representing and advocating for all vulnerable children\u201d, but could not be \u201ccolour blind\u201d. \u201cWhilst poverty and disadvantage is a reality for children from all backgrounds, colours and creeds \u2013 across our UK services, day in day out we see that black, Asian and minority ethnic children face additional challenges as well,\u201d he said. \u201cOn top of experiencing poverty, lack of access to opportunity, childhood trauma, multiple forms of abuse, and criminal exploitation, this group are also treated less fairly at school, by employers, and by the criminal justice system. They have poorer housing, and poorer health outcomes.\u201d Barnardo also said Khan \u2013 the charity\u2019s chief executive, who is from a BAME background \u2013 had been the target of \u201cexplicit racism\u201d following the blogpost. \u201cBarnardo\u2019s will keep raising the issues that matter for all vulnerable children regardless of where they were born, how much their parents earned, or the colour of their skin,\u201d he added. \u201cSometimes that conversation will be uncomfortable, but avoiding discussion of issues that are deeply important for entire communities of people is no longer acceptable.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
