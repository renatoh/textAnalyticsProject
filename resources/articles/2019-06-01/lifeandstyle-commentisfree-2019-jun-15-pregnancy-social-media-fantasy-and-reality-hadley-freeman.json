So this is the last you\u2019ll hear from me for a few months. Who will I rant to every week? Will the baby want to hear my thoughts on politics? If his or her first word is \u201cTrump\u201d, we\u2019ll all know whose fault that is. I\u2019ve been pregnant a bunch of times now: once with twins, now with one baby, plus assorted miscarriages and an abortion along the way. And what I\u2019ve learned from what I think of as my 360-degree experience of pregnancy is that it is a lot like flying economy on a long-haul flight. It is so all-consuming, exhausting and uncomfortable that you can\u2019t actually believe it will ever be over. But then it is; you walk away and never think about it again, because the ultimate destination is a lot more interesting than the journey. But some people feel differently. Pregnancy is no longer merely something to be endured, but a statement about aspirational femininity. Where once just making it through the day without vomiting in my hair was enough, now I\u2019m supposed to wonder if the oils I\u2019m rubbing on my stomach are organic, and how cute my bump looks in my lingerie selfies. Because pregnancy has entered the Instagram era. This spring I was \u2013 I say this euphemistically \u2013 feeling the effects of pregnancy. This means I was \u2013 non-euphemistically \u2013 constantly nauseous and insane with fatigue. My pallor was more grey than glowing and any healthcare professional who asked how \u201cmama\u201d was doing was greeted with growls neither human nor animal. One day, as I was wondering if I should puke then eat another slice of bread or vice versa, an email arrived. \u201cDeliciously Ella shares all of her pregnancy secrets,\u201d it read. Deliciously Ella, AKA Ella Mills, is the wildly successful so-called \u201chealthy-eating inspirer\u201d, whose nutritional advice includes the theory that \u201cto really thrive\u201d we should cut out dairy, gluten, meat, fish and eggs. I read on, eager to thrive like the pregnant influencer: \u201cHer morning routine includes a 7am yoga practice with breakfast being a berry and spinach smoothie with rice milk, almond butter and hemp seeds,\u201d the email informed me. \u201cElla is curbing any cravings by enjoying fresh lemon on artichokes and healthy carbohydrates.\u201d OMG! Just like me! As long as you substitute \u201cartichokes with lemon juice\u201d for \u201csweets with more sweets\u201d. And does eating an entire loaf of sourdough between breakfast (bread) and lunch (more bread) count as \u201chealthy carbohydrates\u201d? It\u2019s entirely possible that I felt so gross precisely because I wasn\u2019t doing pregnancy the Deliciously Ella way. But how was I supposed to fit in yoga around my busy morning schedule of being sick? And I can tell you, making myself a glass of green sludge afterwards would not have helped. Like Mills, model Miranda Kerr has been documenting her photogenic pregnancy on Instagram. All the cliches of pregnancy-by-social-media are ticked off: laughably ascetic meals of toast, tomato and cucumber, exercise videos, \u201cessential\u201d beauty products that she is shilling, gently lit photos of her perfectly compact stomach being held by her adoring husband. Her clothes remain unblemished, even though it is scientifically impossible to eat during pregnancy without spilling at least half on your stomach. My maternity clothes are a homage to Jackson Pollock\u2019s oeuvre, recreated in spaghetti sauce and baked beans, two foods oddly absent from pregnant influencers\u2019 social media accounts. For a while I developed an indefensible fascination with the yoga teacher Hilaria Baldwin, AKA Mrs Alec Baldwin, whose enthusiasm for photographing herself in her lingerie remains undimmed four children down the line. \u201cMy purpose here is to normalie the postpartum figure,\u201d she wrote under one such selfie, and if by normalise she means \u201csuggest someone can have the body of a model hours after giving birth\u201d then she succeeded. There is, it seems, a fine line between a woman inspiring other women in a thrillingly modern way, and a woman promoting her brand by perpetuating extremely conventional standards of beauty. Part of me admires anyone who can turn pregnancy into yet another product of our consumerist and patriarchal society, endorsing the idea that being 38-weeks pregnant is no reason not to be photogenic and high-achieving. But a much, much bigger part of me believes the kindest thing you can do for women is tell them the unfiltered truth. Nothing reveals the gap between social-media fantasy and reality more strikingly than pregnancy, so Amy Schumer has been an overdue antidote to all of the above. Throughout her pregnancy and since giving birth to her son last month, the US comic has been posting images of what motherhood actually looks like, in all its laughably undignified glory. \u201cGuys what are we doing tonight?\u201d she wrote beneath a photo in which she wears a customised nursing bra while attached to two breast pumps. I\u2019ll meet you there, Schumer. And I\u2019ll see the rest of you in the autumn. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.
