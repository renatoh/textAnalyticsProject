The body, which appears to be alive, belongs to a boy. Simon's gay! That's sooo disappointing, though to be honest I had my suspicions (something about the way he has always said he is). Not disappointing because he's gay \u2013 come on, who do you think I am? Disappointing because it means he'll never marry Stella Tennant. (She's married already? And? Marriages end, hello?) So she'll never be Stella Tennant-Amstell, almost certainly the only woman ever in the history of women to be named (though admittedly not spelt) after three popular lagers. Then imagine if, for some reason, she were to bring up one of a certain former England rugby captain's kids, the Sun could run the headline Stella Tennant-Amstel Fosters Carling. I can do better. There's a lager called Brooklyn, I checked. So if it was a certain former England football captain, then it could be Stella Tennant-Amstel Fosters Brooklyn Becks. A six-lager headline! Jesus, where the hell did that \u2013 all the lager \u2013 come from. Sorry. Anyway, he looks very young, this young lad in Simon's bed. How old is he? Fourteen, he says. Fourteen! No he's only kidding. Mark's actually 16, just. And he put about half a gram of MDMA in Simon's drink (not lager, just water) when they were out last night. So just a couple of minutes in and already we've had class-A drugs, the hint of underage sex, even a hint of date rape. I think Grandma's House has darkened up (down?) for this second series, got a little less cosy. There was some edge in the first series, but now there's more. And there's still death (grandad's), arson (grandad's chair) and theft (of a crystal bowl) to come. Simon's mum \u2013 wonderful Rebecca Front \u2013 comes in, and is really pleased for Simon that he's had sex. It's been a while. They have a nice relationship, those two, don't they? I wonder if it was/is like that for Simon and his real mother. I wonder if she \u2013 the real one \u2013 watches and feels jealous of Rebecca for the close onscreen relationship she has with her son. It's not quite the same as it normally is for the families of actors, because Simon's playing himself, or a version of himself. Almost as if Rebecca fosters him. Yeah, back to the amber nectar, why not? Anyway, clever comedy, in which some people are themselves, and other people aren't, may throw up some interesting offscreen issues. Grandma's House is clever \u2013 the family sitcom reinvented for the post-family sitcom age. Simon Amstell \u2013 or possibly \"Simon Amstell\", who knows? \u2013 can be a little whiny and annoying. You could accuse it/him of being self-obsessed and knowing. But it's not just about him. There are fabulous funny performances from everyone \u2013 from Front, from Linda Bassett as Grandma, from Samantha Spiro as Auntie Liz, from James Smith as mum's ghastly on-off boyfriend, Clive. It manages to be genuinely warm as well as properly rude. It's colourful, not just in the language but in Grandma's bright-yellow kitchen units and her tangerine bathroom suite. It's smart and Jewish. Alan Yentob gets a (hilarious) mention. But there are also willies and erections (not allowed in the kitchen), even a dead frog. It's highbrow, and Lowenbrau ... oh for God's sake. If Ricky Gervais's Derek (who gives a Castlemaine XXXX) the other day felt like the Ghost of Comedy Past, and ... I don't know ... This is Jinsy, say (most people weren't ready for Jinsy, too bonkers), felt like the ghost of Comedy Yet to Come, then Grandma's House feels like the Spirit of Comedy Right Now. Refreshes the parts ... enough. Louis Theroux \u2013 Extreme Love (BBC2) was also brilliant, but for very different reasons. Louis visits the Development Learning Centre in New Jersey and gets to know some of the kids, all at various points on the autistic spectrum, and their families. Stark, uncomfortable, honest, awkward (come on, it's Theroux), this was a brutal portrait of what autism does to a family. But not devoid of love though. Or humour \u2013 the nicest part was when 19-year-old Nicky, who'd done a bit of internet research, turns the tables and starts firing questions at Louis, about who he is, and his family. Yeah, I'd like to know that too. His awkwardness pretty much boils over. One thing: why are we in America? I know that's what Louis does, he goes to America. But we've got plenty of autism of our own. Maybe there aren't places like the DLC? I would like to have known, that's all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
