They are one of Spain's most rousing party acts, but also one of its most experimental, thanks to their fusion of flamenco, Catalan rumba (the Barcelona Gypsy version of Afro-Cuban dance music) and hip-hop. Their new album Aocana shows them further exploring those Cuban connections and also the Gypsy flamenco link back to India, and much of this Roundhouse set was taken up with their new songs. As ever, they began with a dramatic burst of flamenco dance before singer Marina \"La Canillas\" appeared in headscarf and feather boas to launch a selection of songs that switched from flamenco to hip-hop, and included the sing-along Todos Mortales. The backing was provided by keyboards, trumpet, DJ scratching, and percussion that included the Latin American caj\u00f3n and Indian tablas, and almost drowned out the band's two fine flamenco guitarists Ram\u00f3n Gim\u00e9nez and Paco Lome\u00f1a, who were given only limited opportunities to demonstrate their skill. This was an entertaining, high-energy show, but the band could have eased off just occasionally for an acoustic reminder of their flamenco roots. London-based opening band Peyoti for President's lineup includes Ulisses Bezerra, the son of the great songwriter of Rio shanty towns, Bezzera da Silva. Their Manu Chao-influenced songs, such as Bad Politician, mixed angry lyrics with anything from samba to rap, flamenco and funk. Most were performed at frantic speed, and at times they failed to match their exuberant album, Rising Tide of Conformity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
