Leeds United might just be too bad to stay up. They defended gutlessly, attacked with equal measures of incoherence and incompetence and half an hour into a galling return to crisis management Peter Reid might have wondered what he had let himself in for. With their fans launching a voluble attack on the club's directors, it must have felt like the bad old days at Sunderland. Reid had been smiling when he stepped off the team coach but left Anfield with the face of a man who had won the lottery then seen his ticket go through the wash. Up in the directors' enclosure the worry lines stood out on Peter Ridsdale's face like contours on a map. Terry Venables, meanwhile, was probably grinding his teeth, having accused Leeds of sacking him rather than merely parting company with him as manager. The last time Leeds were relegated, in 1982, Allan Clarke's team managed only 42 points from 42 games. The current side are not faring much better with 34 from 31, leaving them in 16th position, five points above Bolton, who play tonight. They have taken only four points from their last nine games and will probably need to win two of their remaining seven if Reid is to avoid emulating Billy McNeill's infamous man agerial feat of relegating two clubs (Manchester City and Aston Villa) in the same season. Reid's criticism of his players was scathing. \"I think they're feeling sorry for themselves. A lot has been talked about Leeds's plight this season, with losing players and how difficult it must be for the ones still here. But I don't know about that. They're paid to play football. \"OK, you don't want to lose the Woodgates, the Ferdinands or the Fowlers of this world. But you don't make an excuse out of it. What goes on in the boardroom and the financial side of the club should not affect the players. That may sound harsh but it's what I believe and it's what I've told them.\" His assessment of their performance was equally damning. \"We gave the ball away so cheaply and, let's be honest, our defending was very poor. It drives you mad; you're just talking about basic defending here. We left ourselves with a mountain to climb and even when we got a foothold in the game in the second half we didn't create much. It wasn't good.\" If Reid looked exasperated, Ridsdale appeared tortured, frequently jumping up to remonstrate with the players. At one stage, after one of Raul Bravo's many mistakes, he leapt to his feet in the VIP seats and, to the bemusement of Liverpool's directors, shouted: \"For Christ's sake, wake up man.\" At other times he was berating Danny Mills at the top of his voice. And when Danny Murphy speared in Liverpool's second he closed his eyes and clasped his hands, as if praying for divine intervention. There was none, of course. And Ridsdale, accompanied by his personal bodyguard, shuffled away consumed by the dreadful knowledge that relegation is a distinct possibility."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
