Last week's supposedly 'radical' reforms of Europe's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have been spun as a giant leap forward for the EU and the British Government has been pushing the line that the days of rivers of milk and mountains of wheat are over. The reality is that almost nothing has changed. Europe will continue to pour all its unwanted milk over the developing world. Thursday's deal on CAP has done very little to combat the problem of export dumping or redress the injustice of Europe's agricultural practice. \"Dumping\" is the phenomenon that is destroying the livelihoods of millions of poor farmers. Cargo ships are piled high with EU farm produce and are then sailed to Africa where they are dumped on local markets. By exporting its vast agricultural surpluses overseas, the EU drives down world prices, displacing poor farmers from local and global markets where they cannot compete. To add insult to injury, Europe maintains some of the world's highest import barriers in agriculture, denying developing countries opportunities to benefit from trade. After weeks of negotiations, Europe's farm ministers have failed to reform subsidies in such a way as to remove the incentive to EU farmers to produce too much. Instead they came up with a fudged compromise where subsidies will be awarded according to the amount of food produced in 2000/2001 and the size of their farms. To economists in Brussels this may seem like a clever way of stopping EU producing 11% more milk than we want, but the reality is that the incentive to overproduce remains as strong as ever. Agricultural Minister Franz Fischler has been busy patting himself on the back for introducing measures to promote good agricultural practice and improve animal welfare, but of the \u00a330bn that the EU pays out in subsidies, only 3% will be switched over to reward sound environmental practice, and this not until 2005. In short this is a bad deal brilliantly promoted. While Patricia Hewitt and Tony Blair make a lot of noise about making trade work for the poor, when it came to the crunch they tried but failed to deliver. French President, Jacques Chirac led the gang that knee-capped any agreement on CAP. The reform camp has accepted a change in presentation rather than in substance. In Rufisque, Senegal, the dairy farmer, Douda Dia, makes just \u00a3180 a year from dairy farming. The European Union pays out more than 5 times as much as this every second in subsidies alone. According to Douda, life has never been tougher and sometimes he is stuck with his milk as there is no market for it. Across the border in Mali, Andre Ndieue, a dairy farmer from Manabougou used to have 100 dairy cows, now he has only 35. He, like many other dairy farmers in Mali, is moving into chicken farming, where there is a semblance of a level playing field. Neither Andre or Douda can compete with the 21,000 tonnes of subsidised powdered milk which is imported into this corner of Africa every year. Fuelled by EU subsidies, this is a business that has grown 25% in three years. Back in Europe each cow gets \u00a31.20 a day in subsidies. But it doesn't stop there. Not only does the EU dairy industry get a subsidy for producing the milk, it also receives a subsidy for exporting it. European dairy giant Arla Foods - which delivers milk to half a million people in Britain every morning - also exports some \u00a343 million worth of dairy produce to the Dominican Republic. The European Union gives Arla \u00a311 million in export subsidies to help facilitate these exports which makes Arla's milk 25% cheaper than local produce. As a consequence of dumping like this, 10,000 farmers have lost their jobs in the dairy industry in the Dominican Republic over the last twenty years. For many in Europe this is a subject that seems so distant and dull that they just can't engage. But UK taxpayers are paying a part in Europe's destruction of poor farmers livelihoods. It is estimated that a family of four pays \u00a316 a week towards CAP, almost \u00a3800 a year. Equally scandalous is that while the smallest farmers in rural Britain struggle to make ends meet, 80 of the largest and wealthiest farmers receive at least \u00a3350,000 in EU CAP hand-outs to produce food that no one wants. This is economics at its most twisted. While the EU gives very generously with one hand through its aid policies, its trade policies destroy the livelihoods of poor farmers. Oxfam has found that for every \u00a31 that is given in aid money, \u00a32 is lost because of unfair trade barriers set up by rich countries, meaning that poor countries aren't able to trade their way out of poverty. In the run up to the WTO trade talks in Cancun, Europe needs to show the world that it is willing to significantly change its farming policies and demonstrate that it is committed to helping trade work for the poor and not just the rich. Reforming agriculture is the litmus test of the current development round of trade talks. This matters for 900 million farmers in the developing world who are at the mercy of EU and US dumping. This also matters for anyone who cares about making trade fair. Instead of agreeing to cut back on farm subsidies and dumping dairy, sugar or wheat on the world market the French, Irish and Spanish have fought and won the battle to maintain the reviled CAP. Unfortunately for farmers like Douda Dia, The Betty Ford Clinic for Subsidy Junkies does not exist and it will be business as usual for Europe's destrutive agricultural policies.
