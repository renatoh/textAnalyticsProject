His record of picking winners was such that money flowed like torrents into his funds. As time went by, picking winners became more difficult and some of Woodford\u2019s growth stocks turned out to be duds. A few eyebrows were raised. Eventually, as investors started to contemplate big losses, many of them asked for their money back. The demands for redemptions became so great that trading in Woodford\u2019s flagship fund was suspended for 28 days. Or, to put it in old-fashioned terms, capital controls were imposed. If Woodford\u2019s predicament sounds familiar, then it should. Picture a fast-growing emerging market economy that is proving a magnet for foreign investment. Office blocks, financed by overseas money, are going up everywhere in the capital city. The stock market is red hot because American, European and Japanese investors think the potential returns look a lot better than they do at home. For a while, as with Woodford, everything is hunky dory. Then, things start to take a turn for the worse. The inflow of foreign capital leads to a stronger currency, which makes imports cheaper but exports dearer. The economy starts to overheat and the balance of payments deteriorates. Without preventative action, foreign investors will head straight for the exit, leading to a collapsing currency and the prospect of an appeal to the International Monetary Fund for help. Slapping on capital controls has its attractions, but as will almost certainly be the case with Woodford, it is far too late. Why? Because preventing investors from getting access to their money simply demonstrates just how big a hole you are in. Panic results. But if the crisis of 2008 proved one thing it was that in extremis the unthinkable becomes the doable. And after the second world war capital controls were integral to achieving the main domestic policy \u2013 keeping people in work. Governments thought they could allow free movement of capital or full employment \u2013 but not both. Attitudes changed during the free-market revolution of the 1970s and early 1980s. Finance was liberalised, barriers to capital were torn down. The first big economic decision Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government made after the 1979 election was to remove foreign exchange controls. A lack of curbs on investment flows became one of the central pillars of globalisation. The IMF advice to emerging market economies was that free movement of capital was good, controls were bad. Governments could protect themselves from financial turbulence by keeping inflation, budget deficits and public debt low; by having a flexible exchange rate; and by having deep capital markets that avoided the need to rely on foreign investment. Clearly, though, abiding by the central tenets of the Washington-consensus has not been sufficient to prevent crises. Last week, Mark Carney provided two reasons why that is. The first is that emerging economies \u2013 headed by China and India \u2013 now make up a much bigger proportion of the global economy, about 60% of total gross domestic product. But the profound shift in the economic balance of power over the past 30 years or so has not been matched by a reordering of the global monetary system. As Carney noted, the dollar represents the currency of choice for at least half of international trade invoices and two-thirds of global securities issuance. Two-thirds of the external foreign debts of emerging economies are denominated in dollars, and the US currency acts as the monetary anchor in countries accounting for 70% of world GDP. This means that changes to US economic policy \u2013 especially interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve \u2013 have a disproportionate impact on global economic and financial conditions. The Bank of England estimates that the influence of US financial conditions on foreign GDP has increased by a third relative to its average from 1990 to 2005 even though the US accounts for a much smaller share of the world economy. So, no matter whether they keep inflation low and display rigid budgetary discipline, emerging countries can find themselves in real trouble when the US raises interest rates. The second reason is that the structure of the global financial system lends itself to crises. For a start, emerging market countries know they are vulnerable to sudden capital flight. Their response has been to amass huge reserves in safe assets to fend off attacks on their currencies. There has been a glut of saving, which has helped drive down global interest rates. This leaves investors with a choice. They can keep their money in advanced countries and accept low returns or they can look to the emerging markets where the risks and the rewards are higher. Since the financial crisis, supervision of banks has been tightened up so they have to hold more capital against potential losses. But regulation is much laxer for investment funds, and according to Carney, more than half have a structural mismatch between the frequency with which they offer redemptions and the time it would take them to liquidate assets. Under stress they would be forced into a fire sale that would trigger further redemptions: a vicious circle that could ultimately disrupt financial markets. It is not just Woodford\u2019s problems that illustrate Carney\u2019s point perfectly. The governor has highlighted a fault line in the global financial system and provided a clue as to where the next crisis is coming from. It would be wrong to assume the governor is advocating a return to capital controls: he certainly isn\u2019t. But it is worth noting that when they were in force, financial crises were rare. And if \u2013 perhaps that should be when \u2013 the next big one arrives the call for their pre-emptive use will get a lot louder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
