They diagnosed me with oesophageal cancer in January and were going to give me four treatments, then surgery to remove the cancer from my gullet, then four more sessions to clear any cancer they\u2019d missed. Luckily, the chemotherapy worked and the cancer had gone from my lymph nodes, so the surgeon said I would have two more sessions, then he would schedule an operation to completely remove it, because three months after chemo it can come back. Then this pandemic came along and the operation in early May was cancelled, because I would have to be in the intensive care unit where beds are in short supply. It\u2019s ridiculous they can\u2019t separate patients and staff in the hospitals, to have a separate cancer wing. The whole world is understandably sympathising for coronavirus patients, but why must everything be for them? Cancer patients like me are just getting forgotten about. All people can think about is coronavirus and everybody wants to be seen to be doing their best to fight against it. I\u2019m absolutely cross, I did lose my temper last week, but there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. They said we\u2019re hoping this coronavirus will die down in a few weeks and we can get you an operation. I asked: \u201cWhat should I do in the meantime, go and die?\u201d The doctor said: \u201cWell, I can\u2019t answer that.\u201d It\u2019s the not knowing. What am I going to say if they tell me they have to withdraw my treatment and there is no operation on the horizon. I have to have this operation, it\u2019s the only way of properly getting rid of that cancer. There is only so much chemo you can have before it starts to kill white blood cells \u2013 that\u2019s why your hair falls out. But I\u2019m trying not to worry about it day by day. Whatever will be, will be. It\u2019s just unfortunate I got it at the same time people got the coronavirus. I\u2019m a married father of three children who I\u2019m very proud of, and the government needs to do something. I need an operation. This would give me up to a 50% chance of living for at least another five years, but the cancer will kill me if I don\u2019t get it removed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
