Now researchers want to leave that in the dust. Nasa's third and last X-43A \"scramjet\" was due to streak over the Pacific Ocean last night at 7,000mph for 10 or 11 seconds. The first X-43A flight failed in June 2001. The second flight in March was a success, reaching Mach 6.83 and setting a new world speed record for a plane powered by an air-breathing engine. The last hypersonic X-43A was trying, weather permitting, to break that record by making its advanced supersonic combustion ramjet perform at a level that cannot even be tested on the ground, project officials said on Wednesday from Nasa's base in California. Just 3.7 metres (12ft) long and 1.5 metres wide, the unmanned X-43A is mounted on the nose of a Pegasus rocket which will be carried aloft to 12,200 metres (40,000ft) by Nasa's B-52 research aircraft and released. The Pegasus will ignite and carry the X-43A to an altitude of 33,500 metres (110,000ft) and a speed of about Mach 10, then release it for its brief powered flight. The X-43A will then become a glider and perform manoeuvres until it lands in the ocean. That will be the end of the project, which has cost more than \u00a3124m and has no immediate follow-on programme. The technology may be used in developing hypersonic missiles and aircraft or reusable space launch vehicles, with speeds of at least Mach 15."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
