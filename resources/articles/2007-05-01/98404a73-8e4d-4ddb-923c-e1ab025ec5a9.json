Andrew Flintoff's left ankle survived unscathed, too. There were 26 balls to spare after Hodge had finished his work. His batting was joyful, easy, unabashed and hungry. If Yorkshire had been bowling a hundred overs, you sensed that he would have been there at the end still, smacking his lips in anticipation of one more boundary. And Flintoff? He appeared carefree. The ankle didn't seem to hurt when he danced down the pavilion steps and into the sunshine. Nor when he was crouched low at slip, nor while he patrolled the boundary in front of an adoring crowd, fiddling with his fingers and successfully avoiding much contact with the ball. Mike Watkinson, the Lancashire cricket-manager and not usually one for appearing soft, suddenly sounded like the editor of a women's magazine editor when asked about him. \"He felt quite good,\" Watkinson said. \"He came in early this morning. I want players to be keen but you don't want them to ring you up at eight o'clock and say, 'Will you bowl at me in the nets?' \"I've seen an improvement in his batting since he has been back. There are definitely one or two aspects that just needed fine-tuning. It is good when he comes back to us. It is like when your kids grow up close to you and you don't notice them grow but the grandparents say they have shot up. We notice when something changes.\" Flintoff and Hodge put on 83 for the third wicket and Flintoff had time to ensure the game was Lancashire's, patting the pepperpot-sized Hodge on the head with a big paw when the Australian reached his hundred, before mishitting Adil Rashid for 26. His next examination is a fitness Test with England on Wednesday ahead of the second Test at Headingley, starting on Friday. By the end, Hodge was dispatching the Yorkshire bowling at whim to all areas of the ground - 17 fours and three sixes came from his bat and Hodge himself rated it one of his best innings in any form of the game. It was his second one-day hundred in a row at Old Trafford and gives Lancashire a theoretical chance of reaching the semi-finals of this competition, if they win all their matches. But poor Rashid was not having the Roses debut he would have dreamed of. He flicked his first ball from Muttiah Muralitharan straight into the hands of Mark Chiltern for one and his bowling figures of one for 74 gave little comfort. A few of his deliveries spun sharply, an entertaining number of the rest disappeared back over his head and provided great excitement for the children fielding in the stands. That his one wicket was that of Flintoff, trying to repeat what Hodge had executed, may at least prove some encouragement. The best bowling of the game came from Darren Gough, captaining his first Roses match for Yorkshire. It felt proper to see him back in Yorkshire colours. Without them he looked naked, peculiar, like a lorry cab without its trailer. It was good to see those piston-churning arms, sunglasses and rear-heavy swagger in their rightful place. He and Jason Gillespie bowled intimidating opening spells, leaving Lancashire struggling to score even one an over for the first nine. It was not until Mal Loye at last broke free to pull a six off Gough in the 10th that the Lancashire reply began in earnest and Loye and Hodge powered through to bring up the 100 in the 21st over. It was Loye's first one-day fifty of the year. Anthony McGrath had dominated Yorkshire's innings with his first 100 in this competition, an impressive innings for someone who had not been in great form this season. A comforting club sandwich of a presence at the crease, he was the only Yorkshire batsman to pass 25 and was particularly harsh on Jimmy Anderson, taking three fours off his fourth over and building up steam again as 30 came off the last two overs to take Yorkshire to 250. It seemed like a good score but with Hodge in this mood, it was nothing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
