I'm head of journalism and public relations at a university that does not believe in media apartheid. Now I've said it and, according to Patrick Weever in The Observer on 7 September (Why lambs can't lie down with lions), I should hang my head in shame. Worse, the ghost of Joseph Pulitzer will haunt me for letting the pure thoughts of budding reporters be sullied by the proximity of sleaze oozing from aspiring spin doctors. Yet still I sleep easy at night. Why so? Journalism has changed. This is the centenary year of Pulitzer's founding of the school of journalism at America's Columbia University and the awards that bear his name. Public relations then didn't exist. Now, it is virtually impossible to write a story for publication without having to cross swords with a public relations executive, communications manager, external relations officer, etc - often several, each representing a different interest. Public relations is big business. The Institute of Public Relations, which accredits our degree programme, estimates that UK agency business alone was worth more than \u00a3800 million last year. That figure is expected to double over the next five years. In other words no journalist working today can operate effectively without understanding something of PR. Similarly, a PR practitioner must grasp the nature of news. They are very different disciplines, but to exclude knowl edge of each other's professional, ethical and commercial imperatives is to blinker horizons and limit debate. Journalism and PR students need to know how each discipline works not because, as Patrick Weever suggests, we believe they are the same, but because we know they are fundamentally different. The reality, certainly at the University of Sunderland, is that students pursue a clear path, choosing journalism or PR from the beginning. Among the many things students of journalism learn is never to take on trust something that is given to them by a press officer. Similarly, PR students know not to believe everything a journalist tells them. This healthy scepticism is the essence of a university education. We are neither a journalism nor a PR training course. We seek to provide an inspiring, challenging education that will equip graduates with the transferable skills necessary to survive in the media world. In journalism, that means not only learning how to write, design and report, but also to appreciate a wider view of the professional role provided through media studies and the study of language. In public relations, it means studying business, marketing and advertising as well as media. This does not mean that we neglect the essential tools of the trade for either profession. That is why we are proud of winning accreditation from the National Council for the Training of Journalists for a vocational route through our MA Journalism programme and the IPR for our BA Public Relations. To teach both disciplines within one academic area is not a disadvantage, but a positive enhancement to academic research and the education of each set of students. It is certainly not, as was suggested, a product of cost-saving or forced amalgamation. We don't invite - or expect - plaudits from Patrick Weever, or anyone else, for winning IPR and NCTJ approval. But it certainly means something to our students to know the industries they are studying have recognised the merits of our courses. If nothing else it will give them something meaty on which to chew as they try to decide if they are indeed lions or lambs. \u00b7 Chris Rushton is head of journalism and PR at Sunderland University"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
