There hostile native aliens known as werewolves are the least of their problems; the pan-alien Conclave has forbidden human colonisation, and Perry finds himself mired in a political wrangle as the fate of the planet hangs in the balance. What follows is a fast-paced political thriller laced with observant characterisation, great dialogue, and some genuinely original science."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
