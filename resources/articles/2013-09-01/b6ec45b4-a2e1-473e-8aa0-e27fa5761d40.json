Ben Bradshaw urged the party leadership to give clear and unambiguous answers over its policy direction on Syria, in a sign of the deep unease at all levels of the party about the impact of the government's defeat, which killed off the possibility of military intervention. In an article for the Guardian, the former culture secretary writes: \"The Labour party is internationalist or we are nothing. We have a strong and proud tradition of supporting humanitarian intervention and being prepared to do difficult things with other liberal democracies to uphold global norms and stand up to dictators.\" Bradshaw accuses David Cameron of \"grotesque mishandling\" of the Commons vote and says Ed Miliband was right to \"put a brake on Cameron's rush to war\". The Labour leader forced the prime minister to amend his original Commons motion to beef up the role of the UN and to ensure that parliament would have a second vote to authorise any military intervention. Bradshaw criticises Cameron for the way he ruled out any military involvement within minutes of the vote. He says most MPs were not voting to rule this out. But he indicates that he fears that Miliband's response to the vote this week \u2013 calling for more talks with Iran and a greater focus on humanitarian action \u2013 is mistaken. \"A considerable number of Labour MPs (many more than have so said so publicly) feel deeply uneasy about this. Where do we stand if Democrat America, Socialist France, Turkey and the Arab League go ahead with strikes? What is our view of how Britain should vote in the UN security council?,\" he writes. \"How should we respond in the unlikely event that Putin was speaking the truth when he said he'd change his mind if it was proved Assad was responsible for the chemical attacks? Does being nice to Iran and talking about Britain's now diminished diplomatic and humanitarian role constitute a foreign policy? Labour needs to have clear and unambiguous answers to these questions.\" Bradshaw praises the Labour amendment in the Commons that sought to provide a proper legal footing for military strikes by giving the UN a greater role and insisting on definitive proof linking the Assad regime to apparent chemical attacks. But he is concerned that Labour seems to be hardening its conditions following the government's defeat in the Commons, after the party said it would only countenance a military strike if there was a \"very significant change\" on the ground. \"Instead of sticking to this sensible and measured approach, we seem to have abandoned it because of the incompetence of a Tory prime minister. We have allowed Labour foreign policy to be dictated by the government,\" Bradshaw writes. Bradshaw reinforces his message about the importance of being prepared to act on the international stage, recalling his decision to abandon a BBC career for parliament. He writes: \"I came back from being an observer of politics as a BBC journalist to being an active Labour party member and then an MP because of my disgust at the Tory government's inaction in the Balkans in the 1990s. It was thanks to the 1997 Labour government working with President Clinton that Milosevic's rampage of slaughter and ethnic cleansing was stopped.\" The former cabinet minister warns of the dangers of deciding foreign policy on the basis of the Iraq war a decade ago. \"The prism of Iraq was used to explain last Thursday's votes, not least by senior Conservatives reaching for an excuse for their failure. The problem with prisms is they distort. Leadership is about learning the right not the wrong lessons from the past, judging each case on its merits and deciding accordingly.\" The intervention by Bradshaw, who served as a foreign office minister under Tony Blair and who was promoted to culture secretary by Gordon Brown, comes amid growing unease among Tory MPs over the government's handling of Syria. William Hague, the foreign secretary, faced what were described as \"blunt\" questions from backbenchers at a meeting of the Tory 1922 committee on Wednesday evening. One MP who was in attendance said: \"The meeting was conciliatory. But William was asked about the misjudgments in No 10 about the Labour party's voting intentions, about the misjudgments about the US plans \u2013 there must have been a skin-deep understanding of Washington \u2013 and about the misjudgments in presenting the case. How could the prime minister say you could drop bombs on the assets of the Syrian regime and say that is not taking sides?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
