However, unnaturally, there are hundreds of punters crammed into a vast and (save for the 1,500 lights) gloomy hangar at Shepperton Studios, cheering like hooter monkeys, brandishing giant red and blue foam fingers with uniform abandon - except for the one chap in the third row who's frozen with terror, complaining that he has a \"fear of foam\". Many of them are schoolkids, for whom any escape from lessons at any time is a cue for mass cheering. Others are there to root for the competitors: Graham, Tom, Jeanine, Greg from Bristol and Gail, \"The Gail Force\". Eight years after it departed ITV's screens, having attained audiences in the tens of millions, Gladiators is back on Sky TV. There's a fresh cast of warriors and new presenters, Kirsty Gallacher and Ian Wright, for whom this evidently represents a bid for gravitas, having parted company with the BBC's football panel for not treating him seriously enough. The original TV Gladiators aired in America but was quickly and successfully adopted in the UK. The 2008 version of the show has made some modifications: the costumes are marginally toned down and the gladiators themselves are leaner and meaner, rather than the puffed-up body builder types of yore. \"It's less camp, more fierce,\" says Du'Aine Ladejo, aka Predator. \"Then again, here I am sitting in a body bra!\" The games, however - including Duel and Powerball - remain much the same, while there's continuity also in John Anderson, the hardbitten Scottish referee whose stern admonitions (\"Hwait for the HWHISTLE! Hthree! Htwo! Hwone!\") cow both competitors and gladiators alike. \"You don't mess with John,\" shudders Enigma, AKA Jenny Pacey, 25, a former bobsleigh competitor. She used to watch Gladiators as a child. \"I used to run home from swimming galas to catch it.\" That, along with the realisation that Wolf, the most infamous of the male gladiators, is now entering his late 50s, is a grim reminder of time's passing. Advance press shots of the new gladiators show a gallery of fresh characters, throwing poses against fiery backdrops, chiselled as if for a frieze. Yet beneath their fearsome monikers and descriptions persists a feeling of England, this England, its market towns, call centres and malls. Battleaxe (\"A weapon of war, domineering, aggressive and indomitable, a warrior queen\") is Shirley Webb, a business manager from Edinburgh. Spartan (\"Handsome, disciplined and brave, will take on any army, the perfect warrior\") is Roderick Bradley from Grantham. Atlas (\"As strong as He-Man, fights hard but with dignity\") is Sam Bond, a \"charity fundraiser\" from Bournemouth. Then there is Panther, AKA Kara Nwidobie (\"Beautiful, sleek and prowling, fierce and aggressive - the most powerful of them all\"). She is a day nurse manager from the decidedly un-Amazonian Lancaster (\"A Christmas nativity play is far scarier than doing Gladiators\"), who speaks with a north-west accent so engagingly unpretentious it brings her down to earth as quickly as she does Jeanine into the pool with her pugil stick during Duel. She's actually looking forward to returning to her day job. \"I don't want all my kids and parents to think I'm a big meanie!\" she says, though the highly competitive ex-discus thrower in her flashes briefly to the surface when she remarks upon the cockiness of the competitors circa 2008. \"In the old days they were like, 'Ooh, yes, Jet's great, a wonderful gladiator.' Now they're all chatty in the interviews, saying they're going to smash us up proper.\" It was Jeanine, a product of a more upfront, soundbiting, telly-ready New Britain, who made this latter remark. She was dispatched for her pains by Panther after ten or so seconds into the water, with the strains of Tubthumping striking up to add further pennies to the royalty fund that mercifully ensures that Chumbawamba need never make another record ever again. Head of the new gladiators is Du'Aine Ladejo, 36, AKA Predator, a former 400 metres European Champion. \"Doing this, to me, is more fun than the Olympics - and I never thought I'd say that,\" he grins. He chuckles also at the persistent delusion among the general public, from whom competitors are drawn, that the gulf between themselves, fit and game as they are, and the gladiators, often B-grade track and field athletes, is not huge. The competitors, clad in their slightly humiliating blue and red rookie outfits, appear to be handpicked for gutsiness but also puniness. Take poor Greg, who describes himself as \"five foot six and a half inches tall\" when interviewed by Kirsty Gallacher, herself towering above him in her heels. He is swatted aside in his challenges with the skirted Spartan, who has been the victim of bawdy and ribald chanting from the hen-party section of the crowd, unrepeatable in a family newspaper. It can be forgotten that the competitors, although pitted against the gladiators, are actually competing with each other; Battleaxe, Engima, Panther, Atlas and the rest are merely the gods hurling obstacles in their way. There is, however, an underlying morality to Gladiators, as Ladejo explains: \"We're giving kids another kind of role model, one they're not getting from sports. All the gladiators, whether good or bad, do not cross the referee. We do not mess with John. He is the law.\" In the context of the present-day slew of Darwinian reality shows, from Pop Idol to The Apprentice, which have flourished since the demise of the first UK Gladiators, such underlying decency might seem admirable but quaint. Could it be that this will be a turn-off for a new generation of punters virulent in their ambition to be on TV and hopefully famous, whatever it takes? Certainly, for sheer physical endurance, the award on this day of shooting must go not to the gladiators, who get to snooze or cruise Facebook in the breaks between shoots. Nor to the competitors. Nor, even, to the warm-up guy (probably the hardest-working man in the studio) whose job it is to keep the crowd geed up, with a free Wii on offer to the audience member who goes the most conspicuously and consistently crazy. No, the endurance award goes to the audience. Today's shoot will be compressed, on TV, to 20 or so minutes of rolling action, interviews and cheering. The reality is that, from nine through four, this audience, including the foamophobe, will have been crammed inside a muggy hangar for several hours of mostly static, droning tedium without a break while Health &amp; Safety carry out constant checks, Kirsty fluffs her lines and competitors are winched back and forth across the pool, or asked to go back into the water to re-emerge for second or third takes. Even the opera is not this cruel. Yet still they whoop on cue and wave their foam fingers. Moreover, many of them will be back for future shoots. Why? Because it's telly. Those you'd have thought would just about die of boredom, we salute you. \u00b7 Gladiators, Sun, 6pm, Sky One Where are they now? Wolf AKA Michael Van Wijk Recruited for Gladiators while taking anger management courses. Famously duped into appearing on the appeal to save Karla The Elephant on Brass Eye (\"She needs Wolf Power or she will explode in a shower of pulped yams\"). Today, at 55, Van Wijk kicks younger ass on the New Zealand caged fight scene. Jet AKA Diane Youdale The big-haired object of adolescent longing left after a fall during Pyramid. She now teaches Pilates in Manchester and runs lifestyle workshops. Rhino AKA Mark Smith The massive Rhino's most notable achievement since Gladiators Mark 1's demise was to beat up lottery winner Michael Carroll in a boxing match for charity. Today he crops up as a heavy everywhere, in TV series ranging from The Bill to Robin Hood. Amazon AKA Sharron Davies The current face (and shoulders) of BBC swimming coverage - not to mention Olympic silver medallist - was a Gladiator for one season only. She left after complaining about health and safety procedures. Wuss. Did Maximus ever whine about those tigers?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
