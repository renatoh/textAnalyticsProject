Well, Arsene Wenger has gone to great lengths to extol the virtues of Cesc Fabregas after he criticised Mark Hughes for Blackburn's rough-house tactics in the teams' 0-0 FA Cup draw last year. The cheeky scamp said Hughes did his former club Barcelona a disservice by overseeing such negative play. One can only imagine what he'd have to say to former Nou Camp regular Steve Archibald if he'd have ever seen his now defunct Airdrieonians team play in 2002. \"Cesc is committed and you always like your players to have a winning attitude,\" said Wenger. \"Sometimes it can go a little bit over the top but Cesc has behaved remarkably well this season - I cannot remember one incident.\" In fact Cesc may even get to wear a stick-on gold star in tonight's match if he keeps his gob shut. As for proceedings on the pitch, Blackburn will hope for at least a repeat of the 1-1 draw at Ewood Park this season, while Arsenal wouldn't mind adding to their Premier League tally of 52 goals with something like the six they scored in last season's 6-2 drubbing of Rovers. Key men: Roque Santa Cruz, who has been a phenomenon since joining Blackburn from Bayern Munich last season and... well Emmanuel Adebayor, who can't stop scoring for the Gunners. David Bentley and Cesc Fabregas are a close second, as if the other two score, no doubt one of these two will have created the chance. My prediction: Arsenal 2-1 Blackburn The teams: Arsenal: Lehmann, Sagna, Gallas, Senderos, Clichy, Fabregas, Flamini, Silva, Hleb, Adebayor, Eduardo. Subs: Fabianski, Bendtner, Traore, Justin Hoyte, Gilbert. Blackburn: Friedel, Emerton, Ooijer, Khizanishvili, Warnock, Bentley, Kerimoglu, Reid, Berner, McCarthy, Santa Cruz. Subs: Brown, Mokoena, Rigters, Kane, Roberts. Referee: Steve Bennett (Kent) Pre-match banter: \"Thanks for doing this MBM, Gregg, Arsenal have won whenever you've done one, so this should be easy-peasy,\" whoops Shreerang Sarpotdar. I wasn't aware of that Shreerang, I'm nott known for being particularly lucky, so I don't want to be blamed if the Gunners lose. \"How does Arsenal keep Rovers to one with that clown in goal?\" says Jim in San Francisco in terminology lost on me. Almunia may be missed Jim, but Lehmann's not a bad goalkeeper when he's got his head screwed on. \"I'd forgotten about the Cesc/Sparky scrap,\" says Gary Naylor, whose email landed so early I only just found it languishing at the bottom of my inbox. \"Another example of how Arsenal piously present themselves (aided and abetted by the Press) as the only true believers in the Beautiful Game. I admire Arsenal's play as much anyone - it's the self-righteousness I can't stand.\" I agree they can be a little uppity from time to time Gary, especially when things aren't going their way, but while they're sat atop the league, there's usually less hot air emanating out of the Emirates. \"Hope Nik Bendtner is playing today,\" says Tom Twining-Ward. \"His goal in mid-week for Denmark will have lifted him, and the time is right to show the Emirates crowd that the Abadayor incident has been forgotten\" Ah, well. Sorry Tom, he's on the bench, perhaps Wenger missed his goal. Pre-match build-up: The Arsenal PA screams 'ARE YOU READY!' The Emirates crowd chew their nails, shuffle in their seats, and the odd one for two mutter 'yeah, I suppose so...' Kick-off: To be fair it's a bit livelier as the teams get the match underway. Cesc Fabregas scampers down the right and crosses towards Eduardo, but it's cleared for a corner, which Arsenal take short and work back towards their own goal surprisingly. Arsenal already look imposing. 3 min: Sagna rampages from the right-back position past Stephen Warnock into the Blackburn half but his cross is cleared. Goal!!! Arsenal 1-0 Blackburn, Senderos 4 min: What a start. Senderos heads home unmarked from a corner. Eduardo charged into the penalty area from a sharp Arsenal attack through the centre and could have been awarded a free-kick after he was tripped. Arsenal fans will be thankful he wasn't. 7 min: Setanta Sports are on form tonight. An Australian commentator keeps piping in over the English commentary. All he's done is slag off Benni McCarthy's work rate. Meanwhile Hleb jinks into the penalty area and plays a lovely reverse pass with Fabregas. The ball is cleared and Arsenal come charging back. 10 min: Blackburn finally get hold of possession but look devoid of ideas. Emerton calls for Santa Cruz to drop deeper to pick up the ball, but I'm not sure he hears him. Arsenal show how dangerous they can be as Fabregas puts Adebayor in the clear with a driven 40-yard pass, but the big man is offside. 13 min: Eduardo shows great footwork to get away from Stephen Warnock and dinks the ball back to Fabregas. The Spaniard crosses towards Adebayor but Khizanishvilli (which has just taken me two minutes to type) gets the better of the Togo international. Blackburn win a corner meanwhile... 15 min: Bentley whips it in and Lehmann fumbles under pressure from Santa Cruz. Referee Steve Bennet adjudges the striker fouled the German goalkeeper. Lehmann, predictably flaps his arms about, but by no means is it a temper tantrum that equates to his usually insane standards. 19 min: Arsenal win a corner thanks to the endeavour of Sagna on the right. Fabregas drives it in low (or perhaps cocks it up, who knows?), Blackburn clear to the edge of the area and Flamini hits an ugly high shot over the bar that is as hopeless as his strike against Newcastle was brilliant. 21 min: Friedel makes a brilliant save after a Fabregas header finds Flamini in acres of space 20 yards from goal on the right. He hits his shot low and hard to Friedel's left, but the American parries expertly. 23 min: \"Evening, Gregg. As Arsenal are already in front I guess you won't be doing anymore commentary, as you seem to have followed Shreerang's suggestion and done one,\" says Ian Copestake, with the cheek usually displayed by Cesc Fabregas. I'm still here Ian and I can tell you that Berner has just made a hopeless pass for Rovers, who are struggling to string any kind of cohesive attacking moves together. 26 min: Hleb swivels and finds Adebayor with a crisp side-footed pass 18 yards from goal. Arsenal's top scorer tries to get away from Ooijer , who does well to stop him getting a shot on goal. Blackburn are already desperately hoofing hopeless balls forward whenever they win back possession. 29 min: Tugay spreads play well for Emerton on the right. He lays the ball back to Stephen Reid but his cross is blocked. Bentley picks up the loose ball and shows his team-mates how to cross a ball properly. Arsenal clear for a Rovers corner which... 30 min: ...Bentley puts straight into the grateful arms of Lehmann. Blackburn win another corner, and for good measure, he gifts Lehmann another free catch. Disappointing from England's great new hope. Perhaps my praise cursed him. 34 min: Blackburn are having their best run of play in the match thus far. They've managed to stop Arsenal playing, despite not creating much themselves. \"I'm following your commentary while on a conference call with my boss this sunny Tuesday morning up here in Zild,\" says Stuart Martin. \"Please don't make me spit coffee over my keyboard or into my boss's ears, OK?\" I'll try not to Stuart, although a clear-cut chance for Blackburn almost makes my Arsenal supporting colleague spit coffee on his keyboard. Emerton whips in a brilliant cross which McCarthy takes off the head of Santa Cruz by stretching too far. Santa Cruz should have screamed his name and buried that. Should be 1-1. 38 min: McCarthy knocks a header down to Bentley a full 40 yards from goal and England's new hope drags it horribly wide in an attempt to show Wenger why he shouldn't have sold him. Bentley won't care though, he's got bags of confidence in his own ability cliche etc... 42 min: Blackburn have hauled themselves back into the game impressively, but they just need to make sure of their final ball. Warnock gives the ball away this time when they have a good opportunity to attack down the left. 44 min: Eduardo plays a ball into Clichy in loads of space on the left wing. With all the time in the world the Frenchman throws his left leg at the ball and somehow scoops the ball sideways as if he's got dessert spoons for feet. He'll probably score now. Half-time: The whistle goes and Arsenal deservedly go in with the lead. Mark Hughes will be disappointed his team fell asleep when defending the corner, because they managed to nullify Arsenal and create their own chances for the final 20 minutes of the half. Tea-time... Half-time charidee section: Just realised that I haven't shamelessly plugged my 223 mile run from London to Liverpool yet. So here goes: I'm running between the two aforementioned cities, not because I'm being chased or am particularly masochistic, but because I'm raising money for MacMillan Cancer support, a great charity which has helped me and my family out a great deal. If you'd care to sponsor me or check out a picture of me in the midst of a three-day session at this year's Leeds festival you can do so here. Thanks. Half-time emails: \"Just a half-time thought,\" says Maaleki Bodjona tentatively. \"I'm surprised at how well Arsenal have been coping without Robin van Persie, and they'll only get better when he comes back. Pity he's not playing today, he's gotten used to scoring against Blackburn.\" Van Persie started the season really well, but Eduardo has more than adequately filled the Dutchman's boots in my opinion Maaleki. \"I wonder if David Bentley's relative anonymity is the result of him trying too hard against his former club,\" ponders George Templeton. \"Until 29 mins, you barely mentioned him.\" It's probably more to do with the fact that Blackburn had hardly strung two passes together until about 25 minutes into the match, George. 45 min: We're back underway and Bentley is hacked down unceremoniously by Gilberto. Bentley stands over the free-kick 40 yards out. He curls the ball towards the right corner and Lehmann clumsily shoves the ball round the post for a corner. 47 min: Bentley wastes the corner though. Perhaps George Templeton is right and he's trying too hard. Arsenal break with Fabregas, who clearly controls the ball with his hand. He cuts inside on the edge of the Blackburn box and finds Hleb hovering 18 yards from goal. He hammers a shot past Friedel, but it pounds the left upright and Blackburn clear. Hughes would have been in a right funk after that Fabregas handball - the Spaniard's hardly on his Christmas-card list. 50 min: Arsenal attack again and Eduardo turns Warnock in the penalty area. The Blackburn man wrestles Eduardo to the ground, in my opinion, but Steve Bennett must have thought it was a slip. 53 min: Adebayor takes a long ball on his chest and turns 30 yards from goal. With one touch he leaves Ooijer for dust (or turf, you get my point) and drives a shot from 10 yards which Friedel does very well to save. Bentley is definitely trying too hard, by the way, he hoofs a 40-yard free-kick way past goal into the crowd. 56 min: \"I see that your first overnight stop is Watford,\" observes Elliot Jacobs. \"Can I recommend that you do that stretch in plain white Reeboks, ill-fitting jeans and a clearly branded Hackett shirt to ensure you fit in with the locals on arrival.\" Eh, what's wrong with Hackett Elliot innit? Adebayor tumbles like a felled Oak in the box, but he's clearly looking for a penalty. Arsenal have wrestled back control of the game. 60 min: Flamini brings to an end a promising Arsenal attack with a wasted pass. Clichy muscles try-hard Bentley off the ball but his pass out of defence is misplaced. Blackburn's players hold onto the ball for at least 20 seconds, but Khizanishvilli (there's that name again) brings to an end such nonsense by hoofing an arcing 70-yarder straight up to Lehmann. That's more like it. 63 min: Fabregas gets his foot on the ball and slows play down ready to launch another attack. He finds Eduardo in the box who plays a first-time pass to Sagna, who scuttles up the right wing. He delivers a cross with real pace but it is too far in front of Adebayor for him to stretch his neck and nod home. Intelligent play from Fabregas. 66 min: Eduardo and Adebayor trade passes and Fabregas drives a shot from 25 yards just to the left of Friedel's outstretched arm - but unfortunately for Arsenal fans, it's just wide of the left hand post too. 69 min: \"I'm following your commentary in New Zealand and I'm on the edge of my seat\" (Blimey, really?) says David Whitburn in New Zealand. \"My work-mates must think I'm a bit loopy when I yell out weird and wonderful things from my desk. Go the Gooners!!!!\" I know the feeling David, I make involuntary yelps from time to time, but the news-desk tend to ignore me. This game's taken a definitive pattern of play now: Arsenal attack for 10 minutes then a have a break, in which time Blackburn don't appear to have any idea how to attack, then Arsenal attack again and Blackburn look more comfortable defending. 72 min: Blackburn win a corner after Sagna blocks a Warnock cross. Bentley whips it in but Lehmann gets a powerful punch onto the ball and Arsenal break. The German hasn't had a moment of madness yet. 75 min: Clichy clips in an angled ball from the touchline to Adebayor in the box. He uses his strength to turn Ooijer and then shifts the ball left before hammering a shot straight at Friedel. The American parries the ball straight to the feet of Warnock who lashes the ball out for a throw-in. Great play from Adebayor, he made that chance himself. 77 min: Blackburn substitutions: Mokoena for Tugay and Roberts for McCarthy. Adebayor races past Khizanishvilli but the angle narrows and his left-footed shot is deflected out for a corner by Friedel. 80 min: Friedel makes another brilliant save, wholly justifying Mark Hughes' decision to extend his contract. This time Hleb drives a howitzer of a shot from 25 yards toward the top-left-hand corner but Friedel palms it away. He's ensured Rovers still have a chance of grabbing a point. Ooijer has been replaced by Rigters. Apparently he had a hamstring injury. It's an attacking change. I'm sure Fabregas will have noted that. 82 min: Hleb drifts inside Warnock and plays a sharp square pass to Fabregas. The Spaniard gets the ball stuck under his feet and toes the ball over the bar from 18 yards. It was a decent chance. 84 min: \"New Zealand? Pah. I am following the match from the Swiss Alps,\" yodels Garreth Hayes, possibly putting himself in danger of an avalanche. \"Senderos finally reveals why he wasn't sent back here at the start of the season. Come on Gooners!\" Senderos has had a solid match tonight. He's even passed the ball to his team-mates. The match is becoming a little more open. Arsenal push forward but can't find a telling pass. 87 min: Jason Roberts gets his first touch. It's awful. He knocks it a yard in front of him, but is so slow he can't even make up that yard ahead of Gallas. Adebayor breaks and finds Fabregas in the box. He pulls the trigger, but Warnock blocks his shot with a last ditch tackle. Great defending. Arsenal should have put this game to bed, tucked it in, read it a story and said sweet dreams to Blackburn's hopes. Goal!!! Arsenal 2-0 Blackburn (90+1 min): And that is goodnight to Blackburn's hopes. Hleb jinks inside and finds Adebayor with a square pass. He dinks the ball over the outstretched leg of Khizanishvilli and lashes it into the bottom corner. That's his 19th goal of the season. Full-time: That goal was long overdue. Arsenal were well worth the win after a patchy first half and stretch their lead at the top of the Premier League to five points. Blackburn defended doggedly but they were clearly limited and without Brad Friedel in goal the game would have been won much earlier. Thanks for your emails and sponsorship. I'm off to put some ice on my shins..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
