Last week, due to Covid-19, my husband was given a terminal cancer diagnosis over the phone. He did not even know he had cancer, let alone that it was untreatable. Due to Covid-19, he was told he would not be offered palliative chemo. Due to Covid-19, he cannot see or hug his loving and supportive family, and we cannot comfort each other together in the face of such devastating news. National planning must rightly focus on the challenge from the pandemic, but surely, for humanity, local service delivery must leave some space for a more compassionate approach.
