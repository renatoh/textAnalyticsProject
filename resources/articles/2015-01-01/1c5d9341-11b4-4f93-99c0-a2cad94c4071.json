In stark contrast, his family do not. \u201cThey\u2019re all Sheffield United fans,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThere\u2019s no mixed emotions there.\u201d With United having claimed five Premier League scalps in assorted cup ties in the past two seasons, Walker is mindful of Tottenham\u2019s need to get a good result before the return leg at Bramall Lane. \u201cHopefully we can get a comfortable lead here when they come to our patch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to play the football we\u2019ve been playing, but it\u2019s going to be far from easy going up there because they\u2019re going to chuck everything at us.\u201d Whether or not Walker lines up against his boyhood club remains to be seen. With Spurs fighting on four fronts, their manager Mauricio Pochettino has suggested he may make wholesale changes to the team that beat Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday, stressing the need \u201cto give the opportunity to all the players to be fit and fresh\u201d. Having won 14 out of 17 cup ties since becoming Sheffield United manager, his opposite number, Nigel Clough, has urged his side to start well at White Hart Lane. \u201cIf we get through that first 15 minutes then we settle down,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key.\u201d Back in the Walker household, the kit selection of the Tottenham full-back\u2019s son, Roman, has already been made on behalf of the three-year-old. \u201cHe\u2019s a Blade,\u201d explained Walker. \u201cI\u2019m a Blade so he\u2019s a Blade. He\u2019s got both kits, but obviously he can\u2019t wear a Sheffield United one on Wednesday, so we\u2019ll stick him in the Tottenham one.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
