The results of the study, which will include a look at the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) phenomenon which can afflict passengers stuck in cramped seats for long periods, are expected this summer. The risk of air-travel related DVT and the quality of air on board aircraft have been identified as the key areas to be examined, but consideration will also be given to the transmission of infection, cosmic radiation and the effects of jetlag and work patterns. \"Although a good deal of research has already been done, the purpose of this study will be to evaluate what we already know about DVT, air quality and other issues, and to help us decide what in-depth research to support later this year,\" said Bob Ainsworth, minister for aviation. \"It is essential that we have all the information in front of us before making crucial decisions on large scale, government-sponsored research programmes. We must ensure that research concentrates on the right areas and does not duplicate existing work.\" This latest study will be co-funded by the transport and health departments, with support from the Civil Aviation Authority and the health and safety executive. It follows on from a first-stage study, which identified the main aviation health issues and the main stakeholders with an interest in aviation health. The new study will identify where specific research on the risk of DVT posed by air travel would be best targeted, and suggest appropriate methods for carrying this out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
