Murphy had finished top of the order of merit following the 12 PTC events added to the calendar this season by Barry Hearn, who became chairman of World Snooker last year. \"I've just enjoyed playing so much snooker this season and to win the first Grand Finals is a proud moment,\" said Murphy after winning his fourth ranking title and his first since capturing the 2008 UK Championship. Gould sprang an upset in the semi-finals by beating Mark Selby, twice Masters champion, 4-3 but was guilty of several unforced errors in the final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
