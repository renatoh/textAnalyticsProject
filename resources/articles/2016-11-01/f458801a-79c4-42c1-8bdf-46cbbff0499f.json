The likelihood is that Strachan\u2019s tenure will now come to an end. In offering sentiment which was identical to last month, when Scotland were defeated by the same scoreline in Slovakia, Strachan insisted his focus was not with himself. Scotland\u2019s manager claimed the margin of England\u2019s victory was not a reflection of the 90 minutes. All logic now suggests Strachan will not be in charge when Slovenia visit Hampden Park next March, probably of his own volition. \u201cI\u2019ll have a wee look at it now, go away and have a debrief,\u201d Strachan said. \u201cAt this time it\u2019s hard to take in anything. It\u2019s not the time to think about it [his own position]. I do feel for that group in there. That wasn\u2019t fair. There are games where sometimes it\u2019s not fair and that wasn\u2019t fair. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m thinking about myself at this moment, then you don\u2019t know me. Sitting here and worrying about myself? You\u2019re wrong. Completely wrong. All these guys travelled down here, their families travelled down here. When will I think about me? Probably when I\u2019m just about to die. I\u2019ll say: \u2018Yeah, how did I get on, Gordon? That was a good life.\u2019 It\u2019s nothing to do with me. I have to think about everyone in that dressing room and how I send them back to their clubs not down. They gave it their best shot.\u201d Strachan labelled missed Scotland chances by James Forrest and Robert Snodgrass at the start of the second half, with England 1-0 ahead, as \u201chuge\u201d. He added: \u201cYou just need a wee break now and then or a wee bit of magic to finish off. I am down for the lads but proud about what they tried to do. The game was cruel to the players and in life, if you put that work in, somewhere along the line the game has got to be good to you. \u201cThere are points where the top teams seem to punish us. We have to work on one or two things but I\u2019ve got to say I don\u2019t know if we can work any harder. I feel really proud at the way they played, the way they went about their job. They had no fear about the way they went about their game. At the same time I feel really hurt that they had to go through that last 15 minutes after putting in so much and believing in what we were trying to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
