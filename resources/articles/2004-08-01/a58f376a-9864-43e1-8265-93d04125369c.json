Central to its policy of providing Britain with a modern railway infrastructure is the abolition of the cash-sapping Strategic Rail Authority. Unfortunately, half a dozen or so of the authority's directors are on such lavish six-figure salaries that if, as was originally intended, they are transferred to the new government-run railway directorate, they will be earning more than its head, Sue Killen. The move threatens to trigger huge resentment among Whitehall mandarins. So now, in an attempt to head off the mother of all pay rows, the fine minds charged with overhauling the railways are left pondering a move to create a smaller, renamed version of the SRA which will house the fat cats and keep them separate from their boss. Sir Humphrey would be proud. \u00b7 With the situation in Iraq not going particularly well, the Ministry of Defence asked award-winning comic Rudy Lickwood to fly to the Gulf and paint a smile on the faces of our plucky guys and gals. It did not seem to concern the MoD that Lickwood, one of Britain's sharpest alternative comics, is a critic of the war. But the paradox of a comedian with anti-war views entertaining the troops was not lost on Channel 4 which assembled a production team to accompany him and record what promised to be a singular performance. Alas, the situation in Iraq has become so dire that the trip has been postponed. \u00b7 The highlight of the Archbishop of Canterbury's recent holiday in Wales was a trip to witness Barry Morgan, his successor as Archbishop of Wales, enrolled as a fellow druid at the National Eisteddfod. But while Morgan was dressed in the full white garb for the ceremony, Dr Williams, whose druidic connections have made him the butt of jokes in a cruel press, heeded the advice of his spin doctors and opted for slacks and an open-neck shirt. \u00b7 There is excess and there is the MTV music awards. Celebrities such as J-Lo and Gwyneth Paltrow, who are attending tonight's ceremony, will each be given a goodie bag containing merchandise worth more than \u00a310,000. Freebies include J-Lo perfume, jewellery, iPod minis and Versace sunglasses. Pendennis can only imagine his invitation must have been lost in the post. \u00b7 Is Bruce 'the Brute' Anderson, the rumbustious, right-wing columnist, about to make a comeback at the Spectator ? He was eased out of his position as political correspondent while publisher Kimberly Fortier was in charge, following a series of alcohol-fuelled encounters between the two. Since Fortier took her recent 'sabbatical', the Anderson byline has returned. No doubt he will be toasting his change of fortune with a drop of something fortifying. \u00b7 A rare publishing phenomenon looms on the horizon: a sympathetic portrait of Alastair Campbell. Good Housekeeping editor Lindsay Nicholson, whose late husband, the former Observer journalist John Merritt, was a close friend of Campbell's, is writing her autobiography. Dealing with the death of both Merritt and their daughter, Ellie, from leukaemia, the book pays tribute to the support provided by Campbell and his partner, Fiona Millar. Nicholson is being paid a sum not far shy of six figures, but it is not all good news. She is having to rise at six every morning to ensure the book is completed on time. \u00b7 The Tory's online shop continues to sell Sir Richard Body's book, England for the English, a sobering tale of how multiculturalism is the end of the world as we know it. Body retired at the last election and defected to the Ukip. No doubt the royalties are being put to good use. pendennis@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
