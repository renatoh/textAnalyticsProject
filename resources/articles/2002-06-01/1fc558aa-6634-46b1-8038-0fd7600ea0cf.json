They float, without visible agency, at the top of the championship. Where is the support - or the supporters, for that matter? Last season they lost three of their best players. They have also lost Jack Birkenshaw, their wise and wizened coach, though he remains as a consultant. The club's expectations are modest. There is no money. And there are even fewer spectators than when those championships were harvested in 1996 and 1998. They should hurtle to earth, like Isaac Newton's polished pippin. At the start of the season some sound judges earmarked them for relegation. But their recent victory over champions Yorkshire was their third this season. Devon Malcolm, now 39, and Phil DeFreitas, 36, continue to lead an attack in which the ball is the only thing remotely new; they are backed up by Darren Maddy, who is better known as batsman. Last season's departures, Ben Smith, Aftab Habib and Jimmy Ormond, following on those of Alan Mullally and David Millns, are not even discussed. But a few cracks began to appear yesterday when they were exposed by Warwickshire, of all people. For all their current one-day success, Bob Woolmer's men flounder at the foot of cricket's First Division. However they won the toss and scored 295 for four, a total built upon Ian Bell's diligence and Dominic Ostler's powerful driving. Leicestershire, suddenly, looked frail. Malcolm was off the field for most of the day with a migraine, considering, perhaps, the workload that remains. DeFreitas, struck a painful blow on the knee, much to the amusement of his fellows, hobbled ruefully. The championship debut of Zimbabwe's Grant Flower, in place of the missing Michael Bevan, and the first appearance for his new county of Jamie Grove, lent the side a different hue. Leicestershire broke through as early as the fourth over but bowled poorly on a helpful pitch. They were either too short or too full, like an apprentice barman. Bell, strong on the on-side, played well, striking a dozen boundaries before he got a lifter from Grove. Ostler, dropped at point early on, hit a muscular 81 before he top-edged a sweep, and finally the young left- hander Jim Troughton hit an exuberant and unbeaten 65."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
