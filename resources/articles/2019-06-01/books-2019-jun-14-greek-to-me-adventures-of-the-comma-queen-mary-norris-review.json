She\u2019s not, though, a classicist in the traditional sense. Most people who get their kicks from the dual and the aorist, from Plato and Sophocles, have arrived in that happy place via Latin. But Latin isn\u2019t her thing. Her passport to Greece and Greek was, in fact, Terry Gilliam\u2019s 1981 film Time Bandits \u2013 specifically \u201cthe mighty figure of Sean Connery\u201d who did a sword-and-sandals turn battling a Minotaur-like creature. In the New Yorker office the next day, she announced her decision to visit Greece. Her employer, astoundingly, funded her modern Greek classes at NYU. Later, it also paid for her to learn ancient Greek, at Columbia. To think the Guardian got my Latin and Greek for nothing, and does not even stump up for my Italian lessons! O tempora, o mores, as a Roman might say. Norris convinced the New Yorker to pay for her studies by arguing that Greek would help her in her work as a honer and sharpener of English. And her book brims with nerdish joy in language, in how sentences are built \u2013 the way, for example, ancient Greek verbs hover like the apex of a pyramid above a pile of adjectives and nouns and the all-important particles, which are little shards of informal speech and are often tough to translate. For serious students, there is a famous tome on such words, Denniston\u2019s Greek Particles, which runs to about 600 pages. Norris points out that Plato used them with particular subtlety. After spending a delicious moment imagining being Plato\u2019s copy editor, she comes up with a suggested translation of one of his particle-rich sentences as \u201cWTF, Socrates?\u201d She delights, too, in giving overdue exercise to some of the more obscure English words that derive from Greek. I was delighted to know, for example, that \u201cooporphyrin\u201d, from the Greek words for \u201cegg\u201d and \u201cpurple\u201d, actually refers to the brown pigment in eggshells, and that \u201cpareidolia\u201d (from the words for \u201cbeside\u201d and \u201cimage\u201d) means the tendency to discern images, especially faces, in things. As for modern Greek, she enjoys its effect, on the anglophone, of making the most ordinary things seem elevated. Greek for clingfilm, she points out, is diaphani mevrani, as in \u201cdiaphanous membrane\u201d. My favourite in this category is a word often seen on lorries in Greece \u2013 metaphora. Which in this context means \u201chaulage\u201d. Literally, it\u2019s a carrying-across; our word \u201cmetaphor\u201d is a carrying-across of meaning from one context to another. (The upshot for me is that I now can\u2019t help seeing metaphors as pallets of meaning ferried by the truckload between contexts; or indeed Greek lorries as freighted with significance, rather than goods.) Norris is an eloquent advocate of the ethical value, too, of studying a foreign language, any foreign language. It \u201copens the mind, gives you a window into another culture, and reminds you that there is a larger world out there and there are different ways of saying things, hearing things, seeing things,\u201d she writes. Norris is a jaunty companion, splendidly bookish, full of excellent little facts about, say, the history of the alphabet that you feel pleased to acquire. Greek gives her, she is happy to admit, \u201can erotic thrill\u201d. She represents a hearty riposte to the very British notion that a love of dead languages automatically renders one a chilly, Olympian elitist. Despite the New Yorker sheen, Norris\u2019s roots are firmly working class and Irish; she couldn\u2019t be further from a show-offy, Homer-spouting Boris Johnson. Some of the most pleasing passages concern her own travels around Greece and its islands \u2013 salt-caked adventures with a backpack, sometimes involving clinches with able seamen or other enthusiastic Hellenic suitors. But there\u2019s also something more profound at play. Norris delicately reveals how Greece and Greek have accompanied her through life, in subtle ways helping her to better understand herself, her family and her relationships. A touching passage concerns her taking a course, when an undergraduate, on the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, with the eminent classicist Froma Zeitlin. The poem tells of Persephone\u2019s abduction by Hades, and her mother Demeter\u2019s desperate search for her. In her grief and fury, Demeter locks the world into winter, refusing to let spring return. On one level the poem describes a rite of passage \u2013 a girl is parted from her mother and ends up a queen. Norris explains how the poem taught her that \u201cI didn\u2019t have to be like my mother and wear a girdle every day of my life. I didn\u2019t have to be constrained. I could let myself live.\u201d Our circumstances bring us so many different ways to read these great poems of the past. Recently, reading that same great text soon after my mother died, I found myself reversing the myth in my head: I, the daughter, was the enraged and grief-stricken one. It seemed wrong for spring to have come while my mother remained in Hades. This and many other matters Greek I can imagine discussing with Norris, on some small Greek ferry, nursing an ouzo, as yet another island emerges from the haze. \u2022 Charlotte Higgins\u2019s Red Thread: On Mazes and Labyrinths is published by Cape.
