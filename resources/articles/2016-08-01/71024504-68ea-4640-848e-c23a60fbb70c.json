Now that she has competed in an all-around final on her Olympic debut at 17, Ellie has changed her tune. \u201cIt\u2019s really amazing to be here,\u201d she said after a strong debut in the all-around final. \u201cAnd to know I have so much more to give.\u201d Halfway round, a seventh-placed Downie had hopes to contend for a medal as several of the leaders were struggling on the beam. But she mistimed a leap to the lower bar and was left spinning round it like a malfunctioning Catherine wheel. \u201cI think that was just a little bit of a lack of concentration which is annoying,\u201d she said. She may also have regretted the decision to go for broke with her big new double Arabian dismount on beam. She performed a completely clean routine on the bar \u2013 despite being made to wait a long while before taking to the apparatus \u2013 but mistimed the dismount and fell forward on to her knees. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to train that dismount too much this week,\u201d Ellie said, \u201cbecause I hurt my back in podium training and had to have a day off, then in qualification I fell on my head and had to rest again the next day. So it\u2019s all been a bit up and down. But looking at the scoreboard, if I added on my mistakes I\u2019d actually be in the top three. So to know that is incredible.\u201d If she had scored 0.075 more, she would have edged out her sister Becky as the best-achieving all-around gymnast in British Olympic history. As it is, Becky\u2019s 12th place in 2008 still stands. \u201cI think she\u2019ll be pretty happy about that,\u201d she laughed. It has been a difficult few days to negotiate for the sisters: Becky missed out on the bars final that she has worked towards for the past four years when she caught her toe during her routine. The pair are extremely close and will normally pick each other up when they are down but this time they have been unable to. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t talked to me about it because she didn\u2019t want to distract me too much,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cOur other team-mate Ruby Harrold had completely finished and so she mainly let it all out on her. \u201cEllie\u2019s really happy with her performance but we can\u2019t make a massive fuss of Ellie because Becky\u2019s really hurting at the moment,\u201d revealed their mother, Helen, in the hour before the competition began. Where Becky is serious, single-minded and something of an introvert \u2013 she\u2019s happy to disappear alone to her room for hours on end \u2013 Ellie is the more sociable and chatty of the pair. Her mum Helen put her in pre-school gym classes as a way to kill time while waiting for her talented sister; but coaches at the Notts Gymnastics Club soon realised there was something special about her. \u201cShe was really brave,\u201d said Helen. \u201cShe had a lot of stamina and wasn\u2019t scared of doing all the high things.\u201d Ellie, taller than her sister, is also more powerful, as evidenced in her perfectly landed Yurchenko on vaulton Thursday night, which scored her a considerable 15.100. She has been working on another vault with an extra half-twist, and when it\u2019s ready for competition she will be able to take on anyone in the world. On floor, she has been working hard to add the elegance which comes so naturally to Becky, who danced ballet and tap as a child. Her sister was alongside her as she prepared for the bars, checking the chalk and tension on them, as gymnasts themselves are not allowed to touch the apparatus before their performance. It had shown considerable strength of character for Downie to even make this final, after landing badly on her neck during her floor routine in qualifications. She has suffered concussion before and when she left the arena to be checked over even her parents thought her competition was over. Here in the final she nailed the two and half-twist into front somersault tumble that had caused that fall and scored nearly two extra points. Her performance will be proudly celebrated at Notts Gymnastics Club, which suffered a fractious time when the Downies\u2019 lead coach Claire Starkey departed from the club a little over a year ago. \u201cBecky and Ellie always been Notts gymnasts, and they continue to be Notts gymnasts now,\u201d their stepfather Mark said. \u201cLet\u2019s just leave it at that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
