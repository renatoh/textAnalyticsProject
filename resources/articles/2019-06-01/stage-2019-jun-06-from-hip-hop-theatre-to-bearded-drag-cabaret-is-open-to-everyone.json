Koh is a New Zealand-born, Australia-based singer-songwriter from a culturally Chinese background. She achieved mainstream recognition as the winner of Triple J\u2019s Unearthed competition, has co-hosted the ABC\u2019s Spicks and Specks, and had her songs featured on soap operas Home &amp; Away and Grey\u2019s Anatomy. But it was her star turn as Shanghai Mimi in Finucane &amp; Smith\u2019s polyglot cabaret of the same name that brought her Mandarin-speaking migrant family into the theatre. An homage to the Shanghainese music hall culture of the 1930s, the production, staged earlier this year, featured Chinese acrobats, Cameroonian dancers and a Western house band, with Koh centre stage as its bilingual chanteuse and MC. But even with all that promise, a history of cultural disconnect with main stage spaces \u2013 and the representation of migrant communities on them \u2013 made it a tough sell for her parents, who weren\u2019t used to thinking of themselves as the target market for a city festival show. \u201cMy parents worked two jobs, were immigrants \u2013 they loved arts, they played in school bands, played harmonica, have a karaoke machine and love having parties,\u201d she says, \u201cbut they never had the cultural habits to come on a website and book tickets to a festival.\u201d The cabaret itself \u2013 and its embrace of multicultural identity, references and, importantly, language \u2013 was transformative, not just for Koh\u2019s family but a broader community of new theatregoers. An aunt she hadn\u2019t seen in 10 years came along and cried when Koh sang a Chinese song as familiar to Mandarin-speaking audiences as Love Me Tender is in English. \u201cEvery night of the show, the audience got more diverse, younger and less white. I think word of mouth was very powerful,\u201d says Koh. \u201cBy the last show, there were people singing along.\u201d Koh is new to the cabaret scene but her experience of community and cultural reconnection is something repeatedly identified by veterans makers and performers on its international circuit. Candy Bowers brought her hard-edged, hilarious hip-hop trio Sister She to Australian comedy stages, but it was cabaret where the artist, blogger and activist found her kin. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many spaces in Australia that really understood hip hop theatre,\u201d she says. But when Sister She \u201cslid in\u201d to cabaret lineups, Bowers found a space that was queer, safe and free. \u201cI saw more women there than anywhere else \u2026 It was a festival of the female voice, literally, musically \u2013 but also from our perspective, and that was very clear. And I\u2019d never experienced that in theatre, film, TV or comedy. It felt a lot safer and a lot more fun and exciting.\u201d That internal value system allows cabaret to be profoundly inclusive, across all demarcations. The opera-singing bearded cabaret drag queen, Le Gateau Chocolat hails from a conservative and religious Nigerian background. He came into cabaret as a law student via an impromptu dancefloor performance of Madonna\u2019s Hollywood while partying in a British nightclub. After impressing the drag queen MC, Gateau was provided with a wig, a muumuu and a tube of cerise lipstick, belted out some Shirley Bassey, and has never looked back. The eclecticism of his shows, which intersperse pop tunes with devastating arias, aims to \u201cpull the rug [out],\u201d says Gateau, and \u201cburst your expectations of what a British-Nigerian drag queen and law student should be doing. Cabaret allows you to traverse Kate Bush to Pagliacci\u2019s aria, It Should Have Been Me excerpts to You\u2019re the One That I Want.\u201d The spontaneous choir these well-known songs often create is the foundation of community. \u201cThe nugget of what we are trying to do [as cabaret artists] \u2026 is reflect a shared commonality in our humanity. You couldn\u2019t be further culturally from Australia than Nigeria, but there\u2019s still incredible connection between love and loss and grief in these songs.\u201d Julia Zemiro is the newly-minted artistic director of Adelaide\u2019s cabaret festival, which opened this week. A multi-platform artist herself, she says she\u2019ll alternate performing within the festival with \u201changing out in the foyer\u201d, encouraging audiences to see what they might otherwise miss, and this year\u2019s headline acts include the legendary Ute Lemper, Dami Im, iOTA, Black Comedy\u2019s Steven Oliver and Elaine Crombie. Zemiro observes it\u2019s the \u201creal autonomy\u201d cabaret offers that attracts artists of such diversity to its rooms. \u201cIn TV, even if you give a performance that you\u2019re happy with, you\u2019re not in control of the editing, the rewrites, or the show. Here, you have control over what you do.\u201d Singer and performer Mama Alto revels in the embrace cabaret provides to complex and marginalised identities. Alto\u2019s celebratory revue of trans identity, Gender Euphoria, recently sold out its debut season at the city\u2019s Arts Centre, and she\u2019s performed alongside the likes of the legendary performer Taylor Mac. As a performer originally drawn to jazz, Alto\u2019s experience of cabaret performance as a younger artist showed that inclusivity doesn\u2019t reduce the artistic standards but enhances them. Artists can be ambitious and rigorous precisely because external confections of prejudice does not bar entry or limit practice. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ve been put on the outside of society and art,\u201d says Alto, \u201cbut in cabaret, we\u2019re free to create things that are undeniably excellent.\u201d Bowers agrees. \u201cThere are less cultural gatekeepers in cabaret\u2019s clubs and pubs, backyards and lounge rooms, saying what\u2019s good and not good,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s what theatre could have been if it hadn\u2019t started building walls against women and folks of colour. Cabaret\u2019s always had us there \u2013 the ceiling was higher, or there was no ceiling.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to look like a European ideal. You don\u2019t have to look like Grace Jones or Dita Von Teese,\u201d she concludes. \u201cBut you do have to have the skills.\u201d \u2022 iOta and Julia Zemiro are among the lineup of Adelaide cabaret festival, which runs until 22 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
