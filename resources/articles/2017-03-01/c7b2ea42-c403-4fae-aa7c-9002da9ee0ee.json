Miss Brummell depicts a young girl cradling a cat in a wooded landscape and is one of a group of old master paintings at Kenwood House, a handsome stately home in Hampstead, London, now in the care of English Heritage. Hugh Belsey, a world authority on Gainsborough, said that the painting will be among works that he will list as \u201crejected\u201d in his catalogue raisonn\u00e9, a definitive study of the artist\u2019s portraits, to be published by Yale University Press next year. Belsey believes that the Brummell portrait was painted by the artist\u2019s nephew and sole studio assistant, Gainsborough Dupont. Belsey, a senior research fellow at the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, a UK research centre linked to Yale University, is a former director of Gainsborough House, the museum and art gallery at the artist\u2019s birthplace in Sudbury, Suffolk, where he helped to build up one of the world\u2019s largest collections of the artist\u2019s work. Commenting on works that he has chosen to demote, Belsey said: \u201cThere are some quite well-known ones, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Documentary evidence relating to Gainsborough\u2019s commissions is thought to have been destroyed shortly after his death, creating a verification problem for future art historians. The Brummell portrait was still clearly labelled as a Gainsborough last week at Kenwood House, where one guidebook states that the sitter \u201cwas aged about 10 in this portrait by Gainsborough\u201d. But Belsey is certain the attribution is mistaken, believing that the most likely painter is Gainsborough Dupont, who was apprenticed to Gainsborough between 1772 and 1788. Dupont painted in Gainsborough\u2019s style and George III was among his admirers. \u201cIt\u2019s just not Gainsborough\u2019s style. It\u2019s too messy. It lacks confidence. The handling is rather scratchy in comparison with Gainsborough,\u201d Belsey said. The draughtsmanship of the cat in the painting pales against that of a cat washing itself in a Gainsborough chalk drawing now in Amsterdam, he said, pointing out that the background landscape also lacks the brilliance of other paintings. He added that while \u201cthere doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone who\u2019s doubted it, I\u2019ve always had my suspicions about it. It\u2019s a very good Dupont. It\u2019s his without any doubt at all.\u201d The Brummell portrait, an oil on canvas measuring 30x25in (76x64cm), was bought in 1888 by the 1st Earl of Iveagh. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1928. English Heritage said: \u201cWe are always open to hearing new findings and look forward to seeing any new research.\u201d Its experts have dated the painting to the early 1780s and suggested that it was commissioned when the sitter\u2019s father, George \u201cBeau\u201d Brummell, the famous English dandy, bought an estate near Newbury in Berkshire. . Belsey\u2019s Yale catalogue will feature 1,000 authentic Gainsborough portraits, including about 10 of dogs, which are \u201cutterly wonderful\u201d, he said. The last definitive study of Gainsborough\u2019s works was published in 1958, and was undertaken by Professor Sir Ellis Waterhouse, a former director of the Barber Institute of Fine Arts in Birmingham. The new catalogue adds about 200 works that have emerged over decades. Other \u201crejects\u201d include a painting in the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter. Belsey said: \u201cIt is a portrait of William Jackson, which I\u2019ve told them endlessly is not by Gainsborough. It\u2019s probably by Thomas Hickey. But they have resolutely decided to keep it on the wall as Gainsborough.\u201d The Exeter museum told the Observer that it will now accept Belsey\u2019s judgment about the William Jackson portrait. Nor does he support the Gainsborough attribution of a portrait of Captain Roberts in Floors Castle, Roxburghshire, the stately home in the Scottish Borders: \u201cThat\u2019s by Dupont. It couldn\u2019t be by Gainsborough because he\u2019s shown in a captain\u2019s uniform and he wasn\u2019t made captain until 1795, seven years after Gainsborough died.\u201d Among overseas public institutions, he discounts the portrait of Mrs Charles Hatchett in the Frick Collection, New York, which is described as \u201cattributed to\u201d Gainsborough. That, too, is Dupont, Belsey believes. Belsey said an incorrect attribution detracts from the genius of Gainsborough: \u201cIt blurs the image of his abilities.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
