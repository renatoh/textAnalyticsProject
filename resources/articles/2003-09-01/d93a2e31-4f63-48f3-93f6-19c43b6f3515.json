Worcestershire were already heading for the lower ranks, but Warwickshire's win, after a persistent downpour ended proceedings, confirmed their First Division status. The home side's dominance was built around a century of mature acceleration by Nick Knight, supported by some aggressive seam bowling which, perhaps with a little help from the evening dew, kept Worcestershire's early reply in chains. There was also a direct hit by Alan Richardson, swooping in from third man, that removed Anurag Singh just as he was looking dangerous. Knight anchored the Warwickshire innings from first almost to last, and in so doing passed 4,000 runs in this competition and its various predecessors. Until he moved into the 90s he played mainly from the crease, denying himself those leaping, cross-bat smears that characterise his more boisterous self. The early pinch hitting was left to Neil Carter, who opened the game with a top-edged swat over the keeper, creamed three off-side fours off Kabir Ali's second over and picked up an effortless six over long-leg. Then, with help from Mark Wagh and Jonathan Trott, Knight set about his compilation. His sober half-century took 73 balls, he then saw Wagh and Ian Bell fall to successive balls to put David Leatherdale on a hat-trick, and he gradually picked up speed. A second 50 occupied only 43 balls. Trott posted a brisk half-century before Knight was run out in the final over of the innings. Graeme Hick's eight runs in as many overs epitomised Worcestershire's awkwardness in the face of the nagging accuracy of Waqar Younis, Carter, Corey Collymore and Richardson. Ben Smith blazed briefly and Justin Kemp gave the middle order some oomph but when the rain swept in at 9.55pm the visitors were left 18 adrift of the required rate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
