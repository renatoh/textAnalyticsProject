As it turns out, there's plenty of stuff going on for those prepared to look for it. Ultra-bleak American genius Doug Stanhope has set up shop in London for a month-long residency of taboo-busting provocation and pharmaceutical-powered ranting. These residencies have become a feature of the programming at the Leicester Square Theatre following a similar run by Stewart Lee. Stanhope's also got a brand-new twin CD and DVD release, featuring plenty of the class-leading nihilistic wisdom that's made him a favourite with the likes of our own Charlie Brooker. Leicester Square Theatre, WC2, to 3 Sep. Oslo: Burning The Bridge To Nowhere is out now on Roadrunner Records David Reed, Humphrey Ker, Thom Tuck, Edinburgh Some acts build a cult following that's particular to the Edinburgh fringe. They may be great writers and performers all year round but for three weeks in Edinburgh they become massive crowd-pullers and real festival favourites. In the past that's certainly been true of the Penny Dreadfuls, a sketch trio whose shows have been an acclaimed fixture on the fringe for the last five years. This year, there's no show from the Pennys as a group; instead, they've split to offer three very different solo performances. David Reed has come up with Shamblehouse, a show based around new sketches and storytelling; while Humphrey Ker will be introducing audiences to Dymock Watson: Nazi Smasher!, a comically embellished tale of his grandfather's real-life exploits behind enemy lines in the second world war. Finally, Thom Tuck comes closest to conventional stand-up, with a show retelling his unhappy lovelife as seen through the prism of straight-to-DVD Disney sequels. Pleasance Courtyard and Pleasance Dome (Thom Tuck), to 29 Aug PBH's Free Fringe, Laughing Horse Free Festival 2011, Edinburgh One of the abiding myths that many fringe-goers still seem to nurture is that if something's free, it must be rubbish. In fact, among the huge number of comedy shows now free of charge, there's a sizeable number of potential gems. Sure, you might end up watching something that stinks to high heaven but that can also happen in any of the big paid-for venues so there's no harm in keeping an open mind. Confusingly, there are two different free festivals and they hate one another, but on their programmes you'll find established stars such as Robin Ince and Norman Lovett, as well as some of the finest emerging talents around. Keep an eye out for cheerfully wasted Canadian stand-up Pat Burtscher and bearded subversive Richard Sandling, whose shows mix nerdy film trivia with spoof performance poetry.
