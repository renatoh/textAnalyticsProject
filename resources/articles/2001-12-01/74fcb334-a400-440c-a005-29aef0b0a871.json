Steve Bruce's long-awaited managerial coronation at St Andrews produced a predictable enough outcome; however, the manner in which it was achieved was far from convincing. After two months of acrimony and accusation following his departure from Crystal Palace, Bruce, taking charge of his fifth club since leaving Birmingham as a player three years ago, has a lot to live up to. His predecessor Trevor Francis was widely seen to have done a good job at St Andrews, where as a player and manager he became a living legend, the club even naming their main stand after him. Yet Birmingham became a stereotype under Francis's tutelage, the gallant losers forever on the brink of achievement. Defeat in the semi-finals of the last three play-offs tells its own story. How ironic then if Bruce can deliver Premiership football to the blue half of Birmingham. Indeed his side, now in seventh place, are well poised for a promotion push after the instability of the past months. Darren Purse, whose penalty was enough to win this dour affair, is in no doubt the club has made the right choice in appointing Bruce. \"It's a pleasure to play under him,\" said Purse. \"He was always a winner as a player, he'd always want people to work hard for him and he's the same now as manager. \"There is a buzz about the club; if you looked at the fans today they were all cheering for Steve. Hopefully it can help us pick up a few more points.\" For Bruce the result was all-important. He said: \"It wasn't a classic but at least we're up and running. More importantly it takes us a bit closer to where we want to be, which is in the play-off area.\" One thing the new man has brought with him is luck. After Francis's penalty hoodoo - losing both the Worthington Cup final to Liverpool and their play-off semi-final against Preston on spot kicks last season - this match centred on a penalty that went City's way, after Ian Roper clattered into Curtis Woodhouse in the 14th minute. Despite James Walker saving Marcelo's kick the referee Mike Dean ordered it to be retaken after spotting the goalkeeper moving off his line. It was a harsh decision and Purse buried the retake to give Birmingham the lead and, as it turned out, the match. Despite endeavouring to play some neat football Walsall were unable to produce any clear-cut opportunities. Their chances of taking anything from the game evaporated after Matt Carbon's dismissal 13 minutes from time for two bookings, the first for throwing the ball away, the second for throwing it at Geoff Horsfield's head. After a week in which footballers' discipline has been called into question off the pitch Ray Graydon, Walsall's manager, is threatening to sack Carbon for his display of petulance. Man of the match: Stan Lazaridis (Birmingham City)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
