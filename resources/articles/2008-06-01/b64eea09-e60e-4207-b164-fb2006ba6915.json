Even as a committed devourer of the unusual and exotic, this seemed a little weird to me. Still, I watched the delight with which they began stripping off the raw, delicate leaves and smearing the base of each one with a little salty butter before nibbling away contentedly. Of course, I joined in - and I would encourage you to try it yourself if you are lucky enough to get hold of very fresh, small, young artichokes (best grow them yourself). There is a slight astringency, but also a delicious, raw nuttiness that you don't get with cooked artichokes. We eat them like this at home now - not to the exclusion of cooked preparations, but a couple of times every summer. I sometimes substitute a little good olive oil, to which a squeeze of lemon juice has been added, for the butter. An added, child-pleasing bonus? They make your mouth turn purple and your wee smell funny. Slightly larger artichokes can be grilled or barbecued - simply boil them until not quite cooked through, cut in half lengthways, brush with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and grill over hot coals or under a fierce grill, cut-side facing the heat, for around three or four minutes until it's just starting to char, and serve with a lemony, mustardy vinaigrette. Simply cooked and slowly plucked until the meaty heart is revealed, the largest artichokes need the least complicated of additions to make a feast. Unadulterated melted butter is hard to beat, though a little adulteration rings the changes. Try our anchovy butter, or melted, salted butter with a few chopped thyme leaves (lemon thyme in particular), a little lemon juice and a few grinds of black pepper. You can also stuff larger artichokes - I promise your patience will be rewarded. Prepare and cook them as outlined over to the right, then open out the leaves. Remove the central cone and choke to expose the heart, then stuff with any combination you like of breadcrumbs, cheese, spiced sausage, pancetta, chopped tomatoes or anchovies, and bake at 190C/375F/gas mark 5 for 15 minutes or so. However you choose to prepare artichokes, the thing I really love about these beautifully sculptural and majestic thistles is that they force you to go slowly. You have to be patient and you have to pay attention - and even then you'll still get butter on your shirt. You have to work for every last morsel, too, slowly unpeeling, nibbling, scraping and savouring. To quote the late Jane Grigson, artichokes are \"the vegetable expression of civilised living, of the long view, of increasing delight by anticipation and crescendo ... It has no place in the troll's world of instant gratification.\" Amen to that. How to prepare an artichoke Remove the tough leaves from close to the base and trim the stem to about 2cm long (or, on good-sized ones, remove the stem completely, so the artichoke will sit flat on its base). Cook in plenty of lightly salted, boiling water or in a steamer - simmer for 15-30 minutes, depending on size and freshness. Just-cut artichokes need less cooking to become tender. If you grow your own, you're probably aware that cooking them within minutes of cutting reduces the cooking time dramatically - down to as little as seven or eight minutes for a small one. The best test of doneness is when a leaf from the middle pulls away easily and the heart is tender when pierced with a knife. Artichoke and bacon tart For the crust 200g plain flour 90g cold unsalted butter, cubed 1 tbsp olive oil 1 generous pinch of salt Ice-cold water, about 4-5 tbsp - just enough to make a soft dough For the filling 6-8 artichokes, cooked as outlined on the preceding page 1 tbsp unsalted butter 4-6 rashers bacon (about 80g), cut into 2cm pieces 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, minced 4 egg yolks 200ml double cream 50g hard goat's cheese, grated 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked and chopped 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper First make the pastry. Process together the flour, butter, oil and salt until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Add just enough cold water for the mixture to come together into a soft dough. Press it straight into a lightly greased 24cm tart tin, using your hands and fingertips. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/ gas mark 4. Prick the base of the pastry case all over with a fork, then line with baking parchment or foil, and fill with baking beans (or similar). Bake for 15 minutes, remove the paper and beans, bake for another seven to eight minutes, then remove from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. To make the filling, remove the meat from the artichokes' leaves and chop the hearts. Set aside. Melt the butter in a heavy-based frying pan, saut\u00e9 the bacon until crisp, then drain on kitchen paper. Tip the onion into the frying pan and cook until soft. Add the garlic and cook for a minute. Remove the pan from the heat. Beat together the egg yolks and cream in a bowl, then add the artichoke, bacon, onion, two thirds of the cheese, parsley and thyme, and season. Pour into the tart shell and sprinkle over the remaining cheese. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the filling is set and the pastry is golden. Artichokes with anchovy and lemon butter This easy sauce is a great dip for crudit\u00e9s, too. Serves four. 4 globe artichokes 8 anchovies in salt 125g unsalted butter Freshly ground black pepper Juice of half a lemon Prepare the artichokes as before. While they're cooking, sweat the anchovies in the butter, stirring so they more or less dissolve. Add a few twists of pepper and a big squeeze of lemon juice. Pour the butter into four small bowls and serve alongside the artichokes, for dipping the leaves in. Salad of artichokes, new potatoes and goat's cheese A recipe I've adapted from my days at the River Cafe. It rather extravagantly uses just the hearts - as good an excuse as any to tuck into a banquet of artichoke leaves first. At the River Cafe, we'd add a squirt of truffle oil, but it's delicious enough without it. Serves two. 6 cooked artichokes, leaves picked and eaten, hearts thickly sliced 250g small new potatoes, scrubbed 1 knob butter The very best olive oil Hard goat's cheese Freshly ground black pepper Boil the potatoes in salted water until just tender; about eight minutes. Drain, halve the larger ones and while still warm toss with the artichoke hearts, a knob of butter, a drizzle of oil, a few shavings of goat's cheese and a few grinds of pepper. Serve at once. \u00b7 Would you like to experience A Taste Of River Cottage? Come and join the team at one of our summer open days. Tickets \u00a310.
