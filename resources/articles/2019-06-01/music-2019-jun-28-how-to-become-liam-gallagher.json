We are both in our 40s. I can rock a \u00a324 Primark version of that \u00a3467 orange Oi Polloi parka Liam wore to One Love Manchester. Er \u2026 I own a tambourine. Now, finally, an opportunity has come to cash in on my Liamness. A film about Creation Records\u2019 Alan McGee is being made: Nick Moran, Irvine Welsh and Danny Boyle are behind it, with Ewen Bremner as McGee. They have put out an open casting call for the young Liam, and all you have to do is upload footage of yourself reading the script from ITV\u2019s 1994 doc With Oasis. It\u2019s my time to shiiine. So, how best prepare? I need to think like Liam. Swagger like Liam. Live like Liam. 5.30am: go for a run Who gets up at this time apart from birds and postal workers? Rock stars. \u201cI get up at half five every morning,\u201d Liam told Beats 1 in 2017, \u201celse everyone\u2019s going: \u2018When are Oasis getting back together?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m doing a fucking press-up here, mate.\u2019\u201d What\u2019s the Gallagher regime? \u201cI run for about an hour. Up hills, down hills. I ain\u2019t got one of them silly watches and I don\u2019t listen to music,\u201d Liam told Radio X. I last 12 minutes before keeling over with heat exhaustion. Shouldn\u2019t have worn that parka. 11am: vocal training Liam told Absolute Radio in 2011 he doesn\u2019t do vocal warm-ups because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to sound like Chris Martin\u201d. He told Shortlist in 2013 he was \u201csick of fucking idiots saying I can\u2019t sing\u201d. In 2017, he tweeted: \u201cTo all you NG fanboys, I can and will sing any song he wrote bigger, better than him, even if I was kicked in the bollox by a wood pigeon.\u201d Liam\u2019s voice is different these days \u2013 more from his diaphragm than his throat \u2013 but it takes a fair bit of vocal power to muster an acerbic enough \u201cnice one\u201d. 3pm: get the band back together In 2018, bookies slashed odds of Oasis re-forming to 3/1 after Liam tweeted: \u201cI forgive you, let\u2019s get the BIG O back together and stop fucking about LG x\u201d. It didn\u2019t happen. In 2018, NG told Radio X he\u2019s rather \u201cgo busking\u201d than re-form Oasis. But everyone\u2019s got a price. NG told Vulture in 2015 he\u2019d reform Oasis for \u201chalf a billion\u201d. He never said half a billion what, though. Smarties? Grains of sand? I have a whip round, and send Noel a tweet. \u201cI know it\u2019s not half a billion, but I\u2019ve got \u00a39.73p here.\u201d No reply. 7pm: the big audition I\u2019m ready. All I have to do is read: \u201cI\u2019m not into slapping anyone around \u2026 But there\u2019s days when I\u2019ve needed a slap \u2026 And there\u2019s days he\u2019s needed a slap \u2026\u201d It\u2019s hardly Shakespeare. It\u2019s not even Shaun Ryder, the WB Yeats of Madchester according to Tony Wilson. Imagine keeping this up for a whole film. I press send and unzip my parka. I\u2019ll let you know if I hear back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
