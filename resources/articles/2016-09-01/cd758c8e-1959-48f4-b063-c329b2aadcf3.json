After an 11-hour rescue effort the Northern Territory emergency services team reached the men before midnight and were able to get them down to the ground by 3.30am on Tuesday. It is believed the men, all 23, climbed the 863-metre rock on Monday and got stuck in a gap in the stone after straying off a pathway. Emergency services reported that they were uninjured and had enough water until they were rescued. Climbing the rock is not banned but the Anangu people who live near Uluru request visitors not to do so. Earlier this year the former chief minister of the Northern Territory, Adam Giles, came out in support of climbing the rock \u201cwith stringent safety conditions and rules enforcing spiritual respect\u201d, saying the benefits would be \u201cobvious\u201d. The climb is physically demanding and can be dangerous \u2013 at least 36 people have lost their lives climbing it. Comments on social media condemned the climbers for disregarding the advice not to climb and incurring significant costs in the rescue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
