Radovan Pejic, spokesman for the force, said police were informed of the explosives by the EU peace force in Bosnia. Police sealed off the location yesterday and sent bomb disposal experts and sniffer dogs to the memorial centre, which is located in the Srebrenica suburb of Potocari. \"We found a significant amount of explosives at two separate locations and we have sealed off the wider region of Potocari,\" Mr Pejic said. \"The explosive was ready to be detonated but was removed by our experts and the immediate area of the memorial centre is safe.\" The EU police mission in Bosnia said in a statement that it was monitoring the police operation as well as the \"full investigation into all of the circumstances surrounding this discovery\". Toward the end of Bosnia's 1992-95 war as many as 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed when Bosnian Serb troops overran the enclave of Srebrenica in July 1995. It was Europe's worst mass killing since the second world war. The UN tribunal in The Hague has called the massacre an act of genocide. The 10th anniversary is scheduled for July 11 and organisers expect up to 50,000 people to attend, including regional leaders and international dignitaries. Some 570 victims of the massacre, between the ages of 14 and 75, will be buried at the memorial cemetery during the ceremony."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
