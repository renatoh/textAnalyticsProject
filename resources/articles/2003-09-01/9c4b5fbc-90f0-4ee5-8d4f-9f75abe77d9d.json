However Luke Robinson - the spark for the second-half fightback that rescued the Warriors and took them to another sudden-death derby, the Super League elimination semi-final against St Helens this Friday night - is inviting comparisons with another of the club's recent greats, Andy Gregory. These are early days for a baby-faced 19-year-old, but he has the chunky physique, the range of skills and most importantly the personality that made Gregory such a fine scrum-half. Saturday was Robinson's first play-off game, and Paul Cullen's perfectly primed Warrington ensured it would be a baptism of fire. But he relished the challenge, coming off the bench and stepping confidently into the breach left by a worrying knee injury to Andy Farrell. \"I loved it,\" he said afterwards, offering a further example of his bubbly personality as he traded insults with Terry O'Connor, the joker of Wigan's pack, comparing the big prop's waistline to that of Peter Andre. Significantly, Gregory himself is excited by Robinson's potential. \"He always grabs me for a chat in the bar afterwards, giving me little tips and a word in my ear,\" apprentice said of master. \"It's a privilege to be compared to him. I had his shirt on my wall when I was a kid supporting Wigan, and if I'm ever half as good as him it will do for me.\" On Saturday he was much, much better than Adrian Lam, the Papua New Guinea international who was selected ahead of him at scrum-half. Lam's mistakes led directly to the two tries that gave Warrington a 12-6 half-time lead. In contrast, Robinson earned the penalty that allowed Danny Tickle to give Wigan the lead for the first time in the 58th minute, played a big part in a vital try for Brett Dallas shortly afterwards, then showed the nous to kick the drop goal that finally killed off the Warrington challenge. \"He made an outstanding contribution to the game,\" said another Gregory, the Wigan caretaker coach Mike. \"Lammy was struggling with the pace of the game, and Luke thrived on his absence.\" That leaves Gregory with a tricky decision between the two as his starting half-back against Saints, although he remains more likely to plump for Lam's experience, particularly after admitting that Farrell's injury is \"a major concern\". Wigan have already beaten St Helens three times this season, but with Paul Sculthorpe back for Saints and Farrell struggling, the pendulum has swung back towards the champions, although Kris Radlinski and Craig Smith joined Robinson on Saturday in responding superbly to the absence of their captain. As for Warrington, this defeat may have marked the end of their season, but the manner of it holds so much promise for next year. \"The pace of the game was absolutely breathtaking and we played our part in that,\" said Cullen, who was given a rapturous reception by Wire's travelling support at the end. \"Super League needs a strong competitive Warrington and I'm very proud we've provided one this year. Our chance will come again.\" \u00b7 The National Rugby League grand final will have a British presence for the second year running after Adrian Morley's Sydney Roosters beat Canterbury Bulldogs 28-18 on Satur day to earn the right to defend their title at the Olympic Stadium next weekend. The Roosters will play Penrith Panthers, who beat New Zealand Warriors 28-20 yesterday.
