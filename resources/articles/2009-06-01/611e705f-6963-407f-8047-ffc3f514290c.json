Four days after terrorist bombs killed dozens in Jaipur on 13 May last year, a match involving the Rajasthan Royals franchise went ahead in the city. In an on-the-field ceremony Modi handed over a cheque for \u00a3780,000 to the Rajasthan Chief Minister's Relief Fund. But not all the money cleared in its bank account and Nagrik Morcha, a nongovernmental organisation, brought accusations to the Rajasthan high court in March that Modi was guilty of \"cheating and forgery\". Modi was granted \"anticipatory bail\", ensuring he would not be held in custody for what is otherwise a non-bailable offence. Modi's lawyers told the court that the cheque was merely \"symbolic\" of the IPL's intention to contribute to the fund, and that all but \u00a326,000 had reached its destination. The rest, they added, \"could have been paid in total but due to financial crises two of the sponsors, namely Citibank and Kingfisher, withheld the amount due to be paid.\" A proportion of the proceeds from 6 July's match between the Rajasthan Royals and Middlesex is due to go to the British Asian Trust, a Prince of Wales charity focusing on the subcontinent. Hitan Mehta, a spokesman for the British Asian Trust, said: \"We needed the IPL's permission to run the match. We're not worried in any way. All that Lalit is doing here is to sanction the match.\" Shilpa's surprise Shilpa Shetty, the Indian actress and former Celebrity Big Brother inmate, was yesterday bounced into leading a \"Bollywood extravaganza\" during the British Asian Cup. Journalists were told that Shetty will be performing at Lord's during half-time but Shetty, who attended the launch event as a co-owner of the participating Rajasthan Royals, insisted she knew nothing of it. Bates comes to a point Barring an eleventh-hour settlement, Ken Bates heads to the high court today to defend himself in a libel claim brought by the former Leeds United director Melvyn Levi. The Leeds chairman is a frequent libel litigator but now the boot is on the other foot. Levi claims Bates defamed him in his programme column, where Levi's home address was also printed. He was so scared of reprisals police installed a panic alarm at his house, and he might need it over the coming days: Bates has engaged the fearsome Ronald Thwaites to defend him. \"I'm often accused of cross-examining with a sawn-off shotgun, but I can also do it with the tip of a sabre,\" Thwaites says of himself. Clarets give Flood relief Burnley's promotion to the Premier League last month did not come a moment too soon as the club's biggest benefactor, Brendan Flood, has placed his principal business venture into administration. Flood injected \u00a32.7m into the Turf Moor club last season so it could maintain an otherwise unsustainable wages-to-turnover ratio of 114%. But Flood's predicament \u2013 the firm's administrators predict many more \"casualties\" in a sector to which he is heavily exposed \u2013 suggests his support for Burnley was increasingly in doubt. Now the \u00a350m Burnley will earn in the Premier League will transform their fortunes by ending their reliance on directors' loans. A statement issued by Modus on Flood's behalf yesterday said: \"Brendan Flood wishes to confirm that he will continue to remain firmly committed to his involvement in Burnley FC in the long term.\" Last-minute governance Over the next fortnight, the government will prepare its analysis of football's response to its seven questions on the governance of the game now that the FA has provided its reply. Previously expected in the new year, the FA is the last of the three bodies, alongside the two major leagues, to submit its response. The government's revised deadline was the end of May; Soho Square made its submission just before close of business last Friday, the month's final working day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
