Tony Wilkinson, the partner of the Guardian journalist Decca Aitkenhead, was caught in a strong current and was unable to reach the shore again after going to the aid of the boy, who survived. The tragedy happened on Thursday morning in Calabash Bay on the south coast of Jamaica, where the family had been walking on the beach. The family said in a statement: \"Tony Wilkinson and his partner Decca Aitkenhead were on holiday in a village on the south coast of Jamaica with their two sons, aged three and four.\" \"At 8.30 yesterday morning one of their sons was paddling in the waves and got pulled out to sea. Tony swam out and rescued him. Decca swam out and brought their son to shore but the current was too strong for Tony to swim back, and despite the efforts of local fishermen who swam out to help, he drowned before they could get him back to shore.\" Wilkinson, 49, worked with Kids Company, which was founded by Camila Batmanghelidjh in 1996 to provide support to vulnerable inner-city children. His role at the charity was as an outreach worker supporting young people in and around London, including many who are affiliated with gangs. Previously, he had a home conversion business and had created and managed an organic deli in east London. He joined Kids Company in 2009 while studying psychology and criminology at the University of Westminster. The family home is in Kent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
