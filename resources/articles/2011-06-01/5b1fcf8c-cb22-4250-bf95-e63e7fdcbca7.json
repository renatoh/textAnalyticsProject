The woods below Llanddona were heavy and shadowed bulwarks with the early sun behind them. The very next morning saw grey clouds over Snowdonia, though the high summits were clear, and this cloud now extended to the eastern flank of our island. By teatime the clouds were breaking and the sunshine set this green corner of Anglesey alight. At this time of year the original lane linking Menai Bridge and Beaumaris is a route through paradise. High up above the shore it makes sinuous progress west of Llandegfan village, between verges overhung with untrimmed hedges which create the illusion of a green tunnel. Waist-high colonies of red campion alternate with leggy stalks of buttercup and bright eaves of flowering honeysuckle; dog roses sprinkle their pink, aromatic ladders from high hedge-tops. A glimpse of secretive Llyn Pen-y-parc added sparkle on this advancing afternoon. A grand little lake artificially deepened to create a reservoir, it has all the charm one would expect to discover up here on the perimeter of fairyland. All was peace and quiet as we looked across the fairways of the golf course. No sportsmen were at play, no movement save a distant herd of cattle wandering below the green horizon where the lofty pillar of the Bulkeley Monument poked a sky now quite bereft of clouds. In and out of the dark deciduous trees that herald the heart of the Baron Hill estate were dozens of swallows seeking an easy meal among the airborne insects. Then we turned down beneath the bridge carrying the long abandoned drive to Baron Hill and saw below Beaumaris, looking out over the full tide to the mountains."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
