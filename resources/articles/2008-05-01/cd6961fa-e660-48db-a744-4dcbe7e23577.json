The announcement by Europe's biggest maker of medical devices surprised City analysts and sent S&amp;N shares tumbling. They closed down 13% at 570p. Analysts said uncertainty over sales tactics in part of the Plus business was damaging the company's reputation and could trigger further regulatory investigations into the European medical equipment industry. S&amp;N, which also faced a shareholder revolt at its annual general meeting yesterday, said it was investigating sales practices primarily in the Greek operations of Plus, which it bought for \u00a3460m in 2007. David Illingworth, chief executive of S&amp;N said: \"We have taken prompt, decisive action to ensure the sales practices we uncovered within Plus in continental Europe have stopped and this has impacted our performance this quarter and will continue to do so for the rest of the year.\" A spokeswoman for S&amp;N added: \"The sales practices are ones that don't comply with Smith &amp; Nephew's internal sales practices which are stringent and company wide.\" S&amp;N, which also makes wound treatments and keyhole surgery instruments, did not elaborate on the nature of the sales practices under investigation. It said the investigation by external law firms \"had progressed a long way\" but did not say when it was likely to be completed. Analysts called on S&amp;N to be more open about the problematic sales practices it has uncovered. Jeremy Batstone-Carr at Charles Stanley, said: \"Why has it taken Smith &amp; Nephew virtually nine months to reveal this information about the sales practices. And what exactly is the state of the sales practices? Are they unethical or illegal?\" He added: \"In the light of what has been discovered [at S&amp;N's Plus business] it might be appropriate for European regulators to investigate sales practices in the European medical equipment industry.\" Another analyst said: \"This is really bad timing for S&amp;N. The integration of Plus has cost them money and growth. The [Plus] business should be picking up now.\" \"There is a lot of uncertainty around the investigation [into Plus] which creates negative sentiment.\" The timing of the investigation comes at an awkward time for S&amp;N which has come under scrutiny from US regulators. Last year, S&amp;N paid nearly $30m in a settlement with the US Department of Justice as part of an industry-wide agreement. The US competition watchdog fined the US medical equipment industry more than $200m after an investigation into the relationship between medical equipment companies and doctors. The investigation focused on allegations that suppliers were paying doctors excessive sums under \"consulting contracts\". S&amp;N said it did not admit any liability under the payment. S&amp;N is subject to an informal inquiry by the SEC, the US stockmarket regulator, into possible breaches of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The act outlaws practices such as bribing government or company officials to win business. S&amp;N said it was cooperating with the investigation, which also includes S&amp;N's US rivals. The acquisition of Plus, a privately-owned firm, was one of S&amp;N's last big acquisitions, giving it a share of around 12% in the global orthopaedic reconstruction market, behind US rivals Johnson &amp; Johnson, Zimmer and Stryker. The deal was supposed to boost S&amp;N's business in Europe as well as providing opportunities to sell products in Asia. Yesterday S&amp;N reported a rise in first-quarter profits to $911m from $744m, although the figure was less than expected. At S&amp;N's annual meeting almost 40% of shareholders voted against a resolution to approve the board's remuneration. Ahead of the annual meeting, Pirc, the corporate governance watchdog, had urged S&amp;N shareholders to vote against the initial two-year contract for the company's chief executive, which then goes to a one-year rolling contract. Pirc said: \"Termination provisions (of the chief executive's contract) include a target bonus of 50% salary, which is a breach of best practice in our view.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
