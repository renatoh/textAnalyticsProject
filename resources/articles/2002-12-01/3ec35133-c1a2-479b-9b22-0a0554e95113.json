First there was optimism that his condition, the result of a double-hernia operation in August, would clear up in the Australian warmth with the personal attention that cricketers on tour can expect. Then the increasing suspicion that all was not well as one deadline after another passed with no material improvement. And, finally, the realisation that the game was up. \"There is no progress from Flintoff at the moment,\" Duncan Fletcher, the England coach, said glumly yesterday. \"He's been checked over here in Australia and no one can really find a problem. But he's not fit to play in one-day internationals or Test matches and the whole thing has been a distraction for us.\" On this most miserable of tours, Flintoff's woes have mirrored those of the team as a whole. He was picked when injured, as were Darren Gough and Michael Vaughan. His frequent and traumatic breakdowns echoed those of the patched-up squad, from Ashley Giles to Alex Tudor. And he will return home miserable and unfulfilled, as, barring a miracle, will England. Flintoff's saga has been one of the principal reasons that David Morgan, the new chairman of the England and Wales Cricket board, has announced a wide-ranging inquest into England's preparation for the tour, and one immediate consequence has been the appointment of a chief medical officer to the ECB, Peter Gregory, last month. The Lancashire vice-captain will report to Gregory on his return home and undertake further tests in hopes of a definitive diagnosis of a problem that has bemused all those consulted so far. \"I start off OK,\" Flintoff said yesterday of his bowling, \"but when I get into the third or fourth over I start getting a bit of pain around my groin area. Then it becomes a bit of a struggle in the field as well and it is difficult coming back to bowl for my second and third spells. \"If I can go home, see the medical officer and do whatever he says, I'm hoping I can be fully fit for the World Cup. There is something not quite right with me and I need to go back and get that sorted out.\" Gregory admits something has gone badly awry with Flintoff's recovery. \"Things are obviously not working out,\" he said last night. \"With hernia operations footballers are normally back in six weeks.\" As with Gough and Vaughan, Flintoff's presence on the tour was a gamble, and the fact that none of the three is participating at the current stage of the winter programme lends weight to the derision that has been heaped upon the England management since the team arrived in October. England have until the end of this month to announce their 15-man World Cup party. \"That is a bit of a problem for us,\" admitted Fletcher. \"We're trying to get Andrew fit and ready for the World Cup in February but we need some assurances by December 31, so there are a few complications involved.\" Lancashire are also keen to get Flintoff back in their care; the club have been as bemused as anyone at the length of his rehabilitation. \"We would like to take him under our wing now, to monitor him and ensure he gets into further rehab until the World Cup,\" their chief executive Jim Cumbes said yesterday. \"We're also keen to have a meeting with all parties and find out what's gone wrong, because it's obvious something has.\" Flintoff has excited and courted controversy in equal measure since he made his Test debut against South Africa in 1998. In a country that craves the next Ian Botham as the panacea for all cricketing ills, here was the likeliest lad, capable of destructive batting, the brutality of which had not been seen since the Legend was in his pomp, and robust pace bowling of a steadily improving and reliable nature. Yet there was another side. He was, it was said, not dedicated enough, insufficiently cognisant of the demands required at the highest level. He has sustained injury before - a back problem that developed as a teenager, a broken foot that finished his South Africa tour three winters ago, and a back injury in Pakistan the following winter. But this time was different. Some time during what was an indifferent summer he began to feel the pains. Though a double hernia was diagnosed, he played against India at Headingley, making a pair and taking one for 68. He has not played an international match since. Flintoff's selection for this tour was a gamble but, it was reasoned, one worth taking. According to his former Lancashire colleague Mike Atherton, Flintoff lacked advice in the crucial first few weeks after his operation in August. The upshot was that Fletcher was caught unawares when Flintoff arrived in Australia on October 18 admitting he still could not run. Benchmark recovery times for such injuries suggested he ought to have been fit and raring to go for the opening Test in Brisbane on November 7. It was feared, though, that with an injury list already mounting he would not get the level of personal attention that was warranted, and so he went to the academy in Adelaide, where he worked his socks off before rejoining the party in Brisbane. He had reportedly been bowling at 80% capacity at the academy, but the pre-Test match against Queensland, his first fitness test, was inconclusive. His 26 overs were laboured and followed by unaccustomed stiffness. He could not possibly play a Test. Next came Australia A in Hobart, where 10 indifferent overs cost 62 runs. As England's decline gathered momentum, so did Flintoff's. He missed out in Adelaide and then Perth, back-to-back Test matches. Now the criticism was mounting, with an astonishing attack on his professional integrity by the ECB chairman Lord MacLaurin, something repeated at intervals over the next two weeks, along with counter-arguments citing inadequate management and supervision. \"I know him very well and how committed he is to getting fit and playing for England, so what was said about him was grossly out of order,\" said Warren Hegg, Flintoff's captain at Lancashire. Gough was incandescent that Flintoff had been hung out to dry. The one-day series become the new deadline, and Flintoff played in each of England's three warm-up matches, in the first two of which, for the only time on tour, he ran in with vitality and purpose. But by the time he got to Canberra it was back to square one. Yesterday, in Sydney, with his omission from the official team photograph, came the realisation that it was the end. High and lows March 15: Scores maiden Test century against New Zealand with 137 off 163 balls in a 281-run partnership with Graham Thorpe in first Test in Christchurch. Follows up with 75 off 44 balls in Wellington.Battles against injury throughout a disappointing personal summer against Sri Lanka and India and undergoes hernia operation after being dismissed for a pair in third Test against India at Headingley. November 2: Features in warm-up game against Queensland but has to miss first Test, although he later appears as a substitute fielder at the Gabba. November 15: Included in England side for three-day game with Australia A in Hobart but fails to impress with bat or ball. November 19: Ruled out of second and third Ashes Tests in Adelaide and Perth but remains with the squad in hope of recovering for the one-day series. December 12: England confirm he will fly home before the start of the triangular one-day series."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
