Some families have moved on but others remain with their supporters, and the indications are that many will not go quietly. Tricky. And sensitive, given what we know about the general problem of discrimination against Travellers and the paucity of acceptable sites. So one wonders about the choice of Constant &amp; Co to act as bailiffs, especially as one of the search tags the firm has used to attract potential customers to its website has been \"pikey\". And \"pikie\"; important to have both spellings, obviously. Not a term the firm itself would use, said Basildon council. Merely a way of sending those who might think in those terms to the correct area of its website. So that's all right, then. \u2022 Yes, a controversial choice. What was it Mr Justice Andrew Collins said in 2008 after watching footage of an eviction Constant &amp; Co carried out at Twin Oaks in Hertfordshire. \"The conduct was unacceptable and the evictions were carried out in a fashion that inevitably would have led to harm to those affected. I have no doubt that the council must reconsider the use of the firm in question and ensure that any eviction is carried out in as humane a fashion as possible.\" Yes, that was it. \u2022 Some things are, indeed, constant. Visitors to the Woodstock Literary Festival heard Richard Ingrams, former editor of Private Eye, slagging off old foes like Robert Maxwell and Cap'n Bob's one-time lieutenant, Peter Jay. No nobody warned Ingrams \u2013 perhaps he wouldn't have cared \u2013 but at the end of the bitch-fest, festival-goers spied a figure leaning against a wall with his walking stick; Jay himself. Now a local councillor, no one could tell if he was smiling or seething. Still, there's nothing like being denounced to make an old warrior come alive. \u2022 Joy, meanwhile, at Prospect magazine, at the announcement that David Goodhart, the founder and editor-at-large, is to broaden his portfolio as a director of the thinktank Demos. He will hit the ground running by hosting Prospect debates at the Labour and Tory party conferences. Thus, he will have less time to spend at Prospect. And yet most feel his successor as editor, Bronwen Maddox, will manage quite well without him. Better, even, they say. \u2022 The Brits really are nothing like the French. As testimony to that, we might cite Chris Jefferies, the funny-haired man tried and almost convicted in the press for the murder of Joanna Yeates last year, and perhaps the blameless McCanns, who endured trial by headline over the disappearance of Madeleine. It's different in France, where there is a strong presumption of proven guilt before public conviction; a feeling strengthened by the way that Dominique Strauss-Kahn was paraded before the New York press on sexual assault charges that were subsequently dropped. One immediate recipient of the French restraint in this area is Kweku Adoboli, the trader alleged to have blown a $2.3bn hole in the books of UBS. Photographed by Le Figaro this weekend, he appeared with handcuffs pixilated. Something we might try here? Don't hold your breath. \u2022 Finally, he stood tall as a fighter for truth and decency. But there always was a less wholesome side to Paul McMullen. That was how he rose to deputy features editor of the now deceased News of the World. Thus, having helped to lift the lid on phone hacking, McMullen moved seamlessly into the following battle, a fight to have the bar staff at his pub in Dover pull their pints topless. \"Discussing the size of tassels that would need to be stuck on the girls and whether or not they would be allowed to move while pulling pints was one of the more bizarre conversations I have had with the council,\" he told the Dover Express. \"It was like stepping back into the 1930s.\" Or back, perhaps to the newsroom at Wapping, although those days have passed and Murdoch's plant itself will soon be open landscape. Still, Paul and his super soaraway ideas live to fight on other days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
