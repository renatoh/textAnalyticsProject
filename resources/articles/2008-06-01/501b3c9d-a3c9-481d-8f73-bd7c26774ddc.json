The thumb he hurt while playing at last week's Artois Championships has almost healed and, by the time his home grand slam gets underway on Monday, Murray believes he will be ready. \"The thumb's OK. It feels way better than it did a few days ago,\" said Murray, who missed last year's Wimbledon with a wrist injury. \"There's just a small amount of bruising and I'm not going to make it any worse by playing on it. I had to make a sensible decision. I have made mistakes like that in the past. It was frustrating but it was the right decision. If I'd played it could have set me back a few more days.\" Murray is scheduled to play a practice match on Tuesday afternoon against Serbian Janko Tipsarevic at the Boodles Challenge exhibition event at Stoke Park and will spend the rest of this week either in the gym or on Wimbledon's Aorangi Park practice courts, putting the finishing touches to his preparations. \"I'll get as much practice as possible. I've missed three days, but I've been in the gym and I was on the running track yesterday,\" he said. \"I'll try to have three or four days of hard training and get as much practice at Wimbledon as possible. Then I'll taper down on Saturday and Sunday. I reckon I will be seeded in the top 12, which will see me avoid the top players in the first three or four rounds. That is very important.\" Murray was speaking during a visit to Jessop's primary school in Brixton, South London, which has just been given \u00a3100,000 by his sponsors RBS to spend improving its playground as part of the company's \"Dream Playgrounds\" initiative. He was a special guest at the school assembly and fielded questions from the floor which were trickier than any he is likely to get in post-match press conference at the Championships. He giggled when one little boy asked him how many Wimbledon titles he had won and looked a little sheepish, though he has more chance of doing so this year since, unlike in 2007, he will actually be playing the tournament. This time last year Murray was caught up in a desperate race to get his wrist to heal. In hindsight, he concedes now that there was never much chance of being ready in time even though Murray felt tremendous pressure - from his coach Brad Gilbert among others - to try to play. \"Wimbledon was two weeks too early for me last year,\" said Murray. \"I had the option of having a cortisone injection on my wrist. I didn't want to do that. It would have been better if I had not rushed to try and get fit for Wimbledon. I was pressurised a little bit to have the injection but I knew I could have done myself extra damage. There was no need. It would have been stupid.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
