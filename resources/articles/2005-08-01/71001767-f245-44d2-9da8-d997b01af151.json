The company, chaired by the former Conservative transport minister Steve Norris, also announced it had reached a final agreement with creditors on a full restructuring package. Jarvis gained the support of shareholders for the rescue plan this month and will issue a placement offer document for \u00a350m in new shares in the next few days. A company spokeswoman described the moves as \"another step along the way to a successful restructuring\", which promises financial stability after a long period of uncertainty. But Jarvis has become a shadow of its former self - worth less than \u00a35m, when it was once valued at \u00a31bn. Its share price fell by 2.3% to reach a paltry 3.5p last night. Once a vital player in the fast-growing world of the private finance initiative (PFI), Jarvis became overambitious with its expansion while it attracted bad publicity when it was linked to a rail crash in 2002. It has been forced to sell a key stake in the London Underground consortium Tube Lines and in a variety of school and hospital schemes to escape its mountain of debt. The company has moved its head office from London to York, shed its high-profile public relations team and become a relatively small services firm in track renewal, road signage and plant hire. The plunging fortunes of Jarvis caused grave concern within the government because it threatened to undermine the controversial PFI and public-private partnership schemes charged with revitalising parts of the public sector. Whitehall had issued advice to local authorities about what to do in the event of Jarvis collapsing. The rescue packages have cost \u00a355m in adviser fees, the company admitted when it released full-year results last month. Pre-tax losses to March 31 rose from \u00a3256m to \u00a3353.8m, while the debt-for-equity swap left shareholders with less than 5% of the firm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
