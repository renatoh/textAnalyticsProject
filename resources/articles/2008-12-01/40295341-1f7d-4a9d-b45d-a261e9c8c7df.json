The teams will have to win three games to have the chance of facing professional opposition at the third round stage in March, and a fourth if they are to tackle the third Welsh club in the competition, Celtic Crusaders, when the Super League clubs enter in April. The preliminary-round draw was seeded for the first time to separate the 48 amateur entrants from the game's traditional heartlands - 16 of whom have received a bye to the first round - from eight more unusual entrants including Leeds Metropolitan University, who have an away tie at Bristol Sonics.
