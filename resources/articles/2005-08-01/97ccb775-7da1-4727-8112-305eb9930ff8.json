Twelve to 15 long-tailed tits were regaling themselves in our grove - I, from our window, a distance of about one to two metres, could observe every move as they hopped and flew from branch to branch. They were all juveniles, their underparts untinged with pink. I was hoping they were devouring the midges, which have always devoured me! The feasting lasted approximately 10 minutes. Then one young juvenile hopped to a hanging, leafy twig and this is where Artie Shaw's swing band might have been an appropriate support because the young bird, making no attempt to feed, just kept swinging back and forth. Who can tell if it enjoyed itself? A pity it was done soundlessly for we are, of course, in the season of bird silence. I miss the song in our hectare as we walk. I read recently that the musician, David Hindley, found resemblances between the extraordinary range of the skylark's notes and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Research has even discovered similarity between the wonderful intricacy of the woodlark's song and Bach's 48 Preludes and Fugues. It seems to be well known that female birds have good taste in music! They tend to choose the mate with the greatest range and repertoire. We, human creatures, must bring back the serenade! Of course birds are not the only singers. Here, in our Burren, we are lucky to have living among us a gifted Scottish choirmaster, Archie Simpson. At Easter his choir, the Lismorahaun Singers, gave a marvellous performance of Mozart's Requiem in nearby Ennistymon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
