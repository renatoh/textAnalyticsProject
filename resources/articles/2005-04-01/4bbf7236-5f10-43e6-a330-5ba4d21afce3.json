I will have to go along with a lot of other people and say I can't tell you who will reach the final, but if Chelsea get an away goal I think they will do it.' Kerry Dixon Chelsea 1983-92 'I don't think Chelsea are as big favourites now as they were, but Liverpool haven't got an away goal and still have to score in the second leg. They have to play differently at home, which is likely to suit Chelsea. Teams who sit back against Chelsea tend to get caught out. Chelsea won't miss so many chances next time around. Liverpool know 0-0 and certainly 1-1 is no use to them, while Chelsea will be happy to take a score draw.' Pat Nevin Chelsea 1983-88 'I still see Chelsea as strong favourites, and the fact Liverpool have to win will leave gaps for the likes of Robben and Cole to exploit. Liverpool looked as if they could be opened up during Wednesday's match, and that's more likely to happen next week when they are pushing for goals. The loss of Alonso will have a big impact on the Liverpool midfield's ability to defend, and could mean more space for Chelsea's attacking midfielders. Liverpool had a lot of the ball in their own half - they can't play that way again.' Ian Rush Liverpool 1980-86 &amp; 88-96 'I'd expect the same kind of game as the first leg, but see no reason why Liverpool can't nick a goal and go on to win the tie. The match is still in the balance, and it really is very difficult to predict. Chelsea played it very cagey at Stamford Bridge, and I reckon they'll do the same again, so the game will turn into a tactical battle. Liverpool know they have to win the game, but then Chelsea will also feel they can score at Anfield. It really is so difficult to predict, especially given how closely matched the teams have been this season.' Tony Cottee Everton 1988-94 'People seem to be favouring Liverpool after Wednesday, but it was not a bad result at all for Chelsea because they didn't lose an away goal. I was at the Carling Cup final and Liverpool were unlucky. They played very well against Chelsea that day, but what you will have on Tuesday is just two really good European sides. Past form will count for little or nothing. You could argue Chelsea's strikers aren't in top form, while Baros isn't at his best for Liverpool, and Ciss\u00e9 doesn't look quite fit yet, so it is difficult to put your finger on a potential match-winner. I'd go for a 1-1 draw, with Chelsea sneaking through on away goals.'
