As the curtain rises, we find him lying on the stage, as if he's asleep; then he gets to his feet \u2013 a skeletal, ragged puppet, operated very cleverly by four puppeteers. He really reminded me of the dogs that come into Battersea Dogs Home, where I work \u2013 most of them are strays, in a very emaciated condition. And when he tries to steal food, he has boiling water thrown on him, which I've also seen happen. Once a dog came in with all the fur on his head burnt off, as if someone had placed a hot saucepan on top of him. Sharik is voiced by a male countertenor with a beautiful high voice, to represent the spirit of the dog, and a woman with a deep growl. She sounds exactly as you would expect a dog to sound like, if he could sing. A professor named Filipp Filippovich tempts Sharik into his apartment, with the intention of performing an operation on him to turn him into a man. He fattens the dog up with salami and lamb chops \u2013 foods that our dogs would probably love, though they have to make do with Pedigree Chum. Then Filippovich performs the operation, replacing the dog's testicles and pituitary gland with those of a dead criminal. I've never heard of an operation like this being attempted in real life, but it did make me think about our tendency, as dog owners, to anthropomorphise our pets. At Battersea, we're taught to think like dogs \u2013 to learn their body language, and how they relate to each other. But we're all guilty of wanting to attribute human characteristics to our dogs. I have, I confess, sometimes dressed my Yorkshire terrier, Munchkin, in little jumpers. But really, we shouldn't do that \u2013 we should just let dogs be dogs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
