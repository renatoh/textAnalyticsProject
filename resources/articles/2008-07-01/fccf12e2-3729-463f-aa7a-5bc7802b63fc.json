But they do know one thing, they prefer to dislike him as a writer (racist, misogynist, premature Hitler enthusiast) than as a painter. Plural talents are seen as a flounce of vulgar exhibitionism. The literary works are anathematised, allowed to drift, harmlessly, out of print. The paintings, for the most part, are confined to provincial museums, private collections, Texas depositories. The Tate, without much enthusiasm, picked up the great Ezra Pound portrait of 1939 for \u00a3100. Yet Lewis, glorying in the high church of self, could never quite believe this refusal of popular acclaim. \"I do pretend,\" he said, \"to be able, like Defoe and Swift, to make myself intelligible to an average panel doctor or teller in a bank.\" The extinct volcano of heroic modernism did succeed in his primary aim: to be misunderstood, spurned by the mandarins, unknown to the mob. Estranged from friends and former allies, Lewis caught sight of his face in a cracked mirror. An accidental portrait: \"the mask of a syphilitic Creole\". Whatever was worth recording in life, he asserted, could be mapped in surface forms and \"toxic scrutiny\". The rest was a sack of slithering, stinking meat. Lewis was well acquainted with doctors, after a series of debilitating operations on the bladder, the infected urinary tract, gonorrhoeal scars, the pituitary tumour pressing on his optic nerve. He shocked a preoccupied medic by telling him that he looked like James Joyce, a name with which the white coat was unfamiliar. In an aside from his 1937 memoir, Blasting and Bombardiering, Lewis delivers a Vorticist sketch in prose: \"He had a frivolous little beard, and his face was hollowed out, with a jutting brow and jaw, like some of the Pacific masks.\" Bankers engaged his attention less. They did not obsess him as they did his colleague, sponsor and early champion, Pound. Lewis painted TS Eliot, the former money-market drudge of King William Street, with fastidious irony: a cultural cardinal atrophied inside his prophylactic Savile Row three-piece, hands restraining the congenital double hernia, the V of the groin in its armour-plated codpiece. Flesh as polished teak. Cloth as slate. This monumental 1938 collaboration was offered to the Royal Academy and rejected: the hanging committee (who should themselves have been hung in place of that season's daubs) didn't care for the background. Something unpleasant was occurring behind Mr Eliot's corset-stiffened spine, twin columns of vegetative and probably obscene tribal forms. Hard curtains frame a standard set as claustrophobic as one of Eliot's late dramas in verse: the psychiatrist's chair, or cruel throne, on which all Lewis's sitters were confined. What these unfortunate people are doing, as the scholar-critic Hugh Kenner pointed out, is \"being looked at\". Challenged by the painter's analytic eye, they squirm against the padded backrest: urban astronauts coming, very slowly, to understand the price of human vanity. And, as ever with Lewis, it is a double portrait; behind the immaculately balanced planes of the Eliot face-mask, the fleshy bacon-rind ears, is a prose version, swift and feline. \"He slid there rather than swam .... A sleek, tall, attractive transatlantic apparition - with a sort of Gioconda smile.\" You have to approach the Lewis portraits that way: by dipping into the books for the back story, the sting. Often there is a cover design by the author, explosive typography, drawings hammered into the text to confirm or challenge what is being said. Something interesting is going on, if we take the trouble to notice it, in the apparently insignificant spaces of the serious portraits. Pound lolling, eyes shut in a Freudian trance, manifests his interior Mediterranean against a cloudy screen: a beached and bearded shark in a decompression chamber; his nose held high above the wavelets of his loose-collared blue shirt. Or Edith Sitwell, dozing under her hieratic turban like some equine Kensington matron clamped beneath the hair-dryer in a rather doubtful salon. Visiting Lewis, so she claimed, six days a week for 10 months, forced her to submit to an icy s\u00e9ance, during which the antiquarian bric-a-brac of consciousness floated on unsupported shelves. Unidentified books, stiff papers, globes, have as much right to be considered the subject of our attention. The oversize jewellery, the geometric drapes: the painter was mapping a surface arid as moon rock. Roger Fry, drawing on Lewis's 1918 novel Tarr, emphasised the fact that works of art are a kind of living death animated through \"forms and surfaces alone\". To pose for Lewis was a dubious benefit. Those who have sprawled or splayed for another Freud, Lucian, speak well of the privilege: the gold-card guarantee of value in the market place, the newspaper immortality, hot telephones at Sotheby's New York, the sagging acres of fat-suit flesh. Frank Auerbach's decade-long interrogations in his Mornington Crescent studio can be rationalised as excavations of deep truth, through false starts, heaped paint: the singular human, in the eternal moment, is a weighty matter. The sitter is invited to enter the conspiracy of art - a small defeat for time. For Lewis, the student and opponent of Henri Bergson, time was always the battlefield. And it is never defeated: the subjects of these portraits - co-conspirators, mistresses, weary patrons - are puppets, fashion plates, simulacra. They have the quality of remaining just what they are, fixed in a particular epoch to furniture which is now dust. \"The process and condition of life, without any exception, is a grotesque degradation,\" Lewis insisted. An awkward proposition for a jobbing portraitist, the whole exercise becomes a hysterical revenge. The penance of witnessing humankind, up close, breathing, scratching, yawning, is endured to earn enough to sustain a torrent of prose works, the more ambitious paintings that have to be set aside. Lewis flatters with scrupulous exactitude, allowing the great and good to dodge the claw of time. He scorns revelations of personality, mess, reserving his acid spleen for the books. The memoirs fizz with gossip: Pound sending old boots to Paris for a horrified Joyce, the dandy in tennis shoes. The landscape of the portraits is a cartography of absence constructed around the painter's dread of \"the repulsive turbidness of the intestine\". To bolster self-esteem, Lewis codes details of works that have never been made into otherwise dim backgrounds. Members of the Camden Town Group, with whom he had been briefly associated, might position reproductions of Van Gogh as a small homage, but Lewis quotes only himself. And he quotes images that exist nowhere beyond the occasion of the portrait. There had been a notion, in the 30s, that Lewis would make a series of portraits cataloguing his contemporaries: the scheme was abortive. The artist had no patience with the follicley-challenged. Stephen Spender, a boneless extension of his sculpted barnet, seems to have, reluctantly, laid aside his tennis racket. The wall behind his burdensomely noble head is dressed with scraps of invented Lewis drawings; you can't help wishing that the prim young poet with the sparrow's mouth would move out of the way. Julian Symons, editor and author, his neck retracted by weight of coiffeur, is bolstered by another teasing Lewis self-quotation, a painterly hint at what might have been, in a more enlightened culture, at a better time. The works chosen for exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, curated by Paul Edwards and Richard Humphreys, are arranged in chronological clusters to represent stages in a tempestuous career. Self-portraits: bohemian posing, blasting and Raphael-impersonating. The artist, modelling a collection of funny hats, matures from swaggering, sharp-angled bully to a ravaged bladder sucking on a curved pipe. Then there are women: mothers of his children, redundant mistresses, forgotten society beauties. And, most importantly, the other canonical modernists, friends and rivals: Pound, Joyce, Eliot. This new show reconvenes Lewis's \"apes of god\", a troop of the pre-posthumous, clenched bowels, stitched mouths. There is only one set of teeth on display, the artist's own (while he still had them): Mr Wyndham Lewis as Tyro (1920-21). A jaunty bandit who has come through war, leaving his expectations, along with the sculptor Gaudier-Brzeska, hope of the Vorticists, face down in the mud. Gaudier-Brzeska was killed at Neuville-St-Vaast on June 5 1915. The solitary smile in 40 years of Lewis portraiture tilts the untroubled face of Lord Carlow. It's the same old chair, but the backdrop is naked and bereft. This smooth account of Carlow's saturnine features and fine tailoring signals the moment when Wyndham Lewis stopped being an irritant and became a person to collect, producer of manuscripts and first editions. The tactful Paul Edwards selection is, among other things, a record of this process: the enemy of the stars, tempering rage, coming to terms with domesticity and physical frailty. Knowing when to abandon an unworthy struggle. The extant portraits of the 30s - GK Chesterton, Rebecca West, Spender, Sir Stafford Cripps - gather and display the personalities of the era in a taxonomy of unease. The accidental cast list of those who sat for Lewis doesn't amount to a convincing analysis of a slippery decade. Here we find none of the rhetoric and pomp of Oskar Kokoschka's Vienna, nor the schematic grids of Gerhard Richter's politicians and urban terrorists. Chesterton, in the 1932 pencil study, pince-nez, eyeballs rolling in different directions, is a flounder of flesh, a water buffalo in the wrong pond. Wing-Commander Orlebar, winner of the Schneider Trophy air race, is on parade only because his flying helmet reminded Lewis of Dante. The artist was a fetishist for helmets and hats; carving hair, if no decent lid were available, into stiff waves, with ambitions of becoming felt or leather. A 1921 sketch, purporting to be of Virginia Woolf, is actually a portrait of a floppy summer hat with the ghost of something dangling beneath it. When Omar Pound, Ezra's son, was tasked with guiding the half-blind Lewis on to the ferry from Fishguard to Cork, the old painter noticed a vague outline and growled: \"What kind of hat is she wearing?\" Kenner was convinced that the late Lewis portraits \"assimilate and justify all the procedures of his career as a visual artist\". Jane Farrington, on the other hand, assessing the painter for a retrospective at the Tate Gallery in 1980, found \"dreary rows of society portraits, produced to keep the wolf from the door\". The grind of poverty, favour-seeking, loan-demanding, status-assertion, condemned Lewis to his \"portmanteau\" existence as novelist, occasional lecturer, hireling portraitist. The shattering and justified ambition of the Timon of Athens drawings of 1912 and the rhythmic, machine-driven poetry of Enemy of the Stars (1932) were unrecognised, little valued. The stage instructions from this impossible play were never taken up as a cultural manifesto for a new form that synthesised drama and painting: \"Rouge mask in aluminium mirror - the grimace of sunset through the dark glass of the twilight - it rushes in almost with a faint roar of water. A leaden gob, slipped at zenith, the first drop of violent night.\" The portraits in this show provide a rare opportunity to revise old prejudices and make restitution to the shades of the man Walter Sickert called \"the greatest portraitist of this or any other time\". Works, known only in reproduction, come alive and sing. Lewis is revealed as a considerable colourist, not a gravy blender restricted to greys, browns and murky corduroys. The background of Portrait of the Artist as the Painter Raphael (1921) is not the flat expanse of dim orange that it once appeared but a hot pink overpainting of the rejected Vorticist experiments beneath. Iris Barry, in L'Ing\u00e9nue (1919), is warmer and more delicate in shape and shading than the catalogue version. We realise, as we move closer, that a secondary exhibition can be discovered in the fragmentary works the artist employs to activate his compositional space: a final self-curated show hidden away like a library of the lost. Fifty years dead, long out of fashion, the blind man can still teach us how to see. \u00b7 \"Wyndham Lewis: Portraits\" is at the National Portrait Gallery, London WC2 until October 19.
