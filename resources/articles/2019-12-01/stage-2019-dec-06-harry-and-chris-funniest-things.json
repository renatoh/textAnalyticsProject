An author reading a poem about bums'", "bodyText": "The funniest standup I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 Harry: This National Poetry Day I performed alongside [poet] Paul Cookson, who at one point had a roomful of primary school children joining in with a poem about bums. By the end of it, they were rolling on the floor unable to breathe because they were laughing so much. The funniest sketch I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 Chris: JK! Studios\u2019 Happy Fun Friends sketch is amazing. They\u2019re a Utah sketch group and aside from being very nice people \u2013 they\u2019re Mormons so I think it comes with the territory \u2013 they\u2019re incredibly funny. The funniest heckle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 Harry: Not an intentional heckle but I did go to high five a woman in the front row during a gig in Macclesfield. But by the time I got there, she had fallen asleep, which her friends found very funny. The funniest dream I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 Chris: I once woke myself up by laughing at a dream, but I can\u2019t remember what it was. I think it involved a heist, Alex Horne and several dogs. The funniest thing that shouldn\u2019t be funny \u2026 Chris: Wishing someone a \u201chappy Christmas period\u201d and worrying they might misconstrue it as a reference to menstruation. The funniest word \u2026 Harry: The German word for slug is nacktschnecke, which translates as \u201cnaked snail\u201d, and is only topped by the German word for nipple: brustwarze, or \u201cbreast-wart\u201d.
