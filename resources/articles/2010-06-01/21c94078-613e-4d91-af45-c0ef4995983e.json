The second thing to say is that he still does not go far enough \u2013 and in the gulf between those two positions lies the feebleness of Westminster's response to the biggest banking crisis since the first world war. First though, credit where it is due. The Tories were always ahead of Labour when it came to reforming the banks (even while David Cameron was all over the shop when Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley were actually falling over) \u2013 and last night's announcements show that they have not lost that impetus in power. Just look at what the new chancellor is promising: a tax on banks, brought in without Labour quavering about Britain going it alone; the transfer of powers from the Financial Services Authority, which was meant to monitor bad behaviour at banks but instead fell asleep \u2013 and, the appointment of a new commission to look into reforming the finance industry. Mr Osborne is under no obligation to follow commission recommendations, but still this does not look like the political equivalent of a drop kick into the long grass. The panellists include Martin Wolf of the FT and former regulator Claire Spottiswoode \u2013 both of whom are on the record as wanting to split up banks that are too big or unwieldy. What a difference this makes from those dreary Labour-appointed inquiries into the City headed by exactly those bankers who would make sure that they came up with precisely nothing. Full marks, then? Well, no. First, the chancellor's new regime gives too much power with Mervyn King at the Bank of England. Not only has Mr King blotted his copybook in this crisis \u2013 being slow to cut interest rates and wittering about moral hazard and other high-table arcana while Northern Rock was mid-collapse \u2013 now he faces contradictory pressures. What if Megabank, say, is in meltdown and needs low interest rates but the economy is overheating and requires a big rate rise? The don of Threadneedle Street will be pulled both ways. What is also missing from these proposals is a sense of what banks are for. Either we use them to channel funds into green technology and other parts of the economy that need it \u2013 as the New Economics Foundation recommends \u2013 or we leave them to stoke up the next credit boom and bust. This is a debate that the prospective Labour leaders need to engage with, too. This once-in-a-lifetime banking crisis should not merely produce sleeker watchdogs \u2013 it offers far more and bigger lessons than that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
