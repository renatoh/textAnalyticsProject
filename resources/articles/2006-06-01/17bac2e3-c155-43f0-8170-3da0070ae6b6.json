More than 90% of holidaymakers claim to explore the local culture when taking trips overseas. According to the survey, three in five love to try local food and more than two in three do not miss home cooking. Around 20% try to speak the local language, with only 8% saying they would never try to converse in the native tongue. But more than one in 10 Britons prefer the beach to local sights and 6% prefer British food to local fare. Around 6% also admit to have \"waved their hands and arms around\" or \"spoken loudly and clearly in English\" in the hope that a local will understand them. Also, one-third of holidaymakers take teabags away with them and more than one-quarter take sweets and chocolate around on their travels. As many as 13% take Marmite, while nearly 2.8m tins of baked beans are taken abroad every year. Alison Couper, a spokesman for Hotels.com, which commissioned the survey said: \"As we travel further afield and more often, it's clear that the majority of Brits embrace the local cultures, cuisine and traditions of their destination. \"What this report demonstrates is that we're officially a nation of discerning travellers throughout the world, and that we can confidently shrug off the old 'Brits abroad' stereotype. Although it may take us a little longer to leave our teabags, Marmite and Mars Bars at home.\" It is estimated that each year Britons take away with them: \u00b7 22,610,000 packets of tea bags \u00b7 17,622,500 items of British confectionery \u00b7 8,645,000 jars of Marmite \u00b7 6,650,000 packets of biscuits \u00b7 2,793,000 tins of baked beans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
