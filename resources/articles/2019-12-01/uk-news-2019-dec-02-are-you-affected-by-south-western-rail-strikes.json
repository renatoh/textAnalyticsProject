RMT members will walk out every day of the month apart from 1 December, 12 December \u2013 election day \u2013 and 25 and 26 December. SWR is one of the busiest commuter lines in the country \u2013 used by around 600,000 passengers daily \u2013 and all who use the service are expected to be affected. SWR has published a detailed strike timetable with around half of the weekday trains running however these services are expected to be more packed than usual. The union has taken action over a long-term dispute regarding the future presence of guards on all trains, even though SWR have made multiple public pledges to keep guards on trains talks between the union and company have recently broken down. The RMT has also begun a chain of strikes for seven successive Saturdays, running through December on West Midlands services.
