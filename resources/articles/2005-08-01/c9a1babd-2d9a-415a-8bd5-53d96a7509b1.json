The 73-year-old magnate is under more pressure now than at any time since the credit crunch of the early Nineties and some observers of the great man's affairs claim they can discern a 'fin de si\u00e8cle' atmosphere about the news organisation. Andrew Neil, formerly Sunday Times editor and chief executive of the Sky satellite TV business, says: 'He is alienating people from one end of the world to the other. I think he could find himself in big trouble.' Neil, who now heads the Scotsman and Spectator arms of the Barclay brothers' newspaper interests, is a natural competitor, so you might expect a Cassandra-like analysis of his former employer. But others, who have not fallen out with Murdoch, also paint a bleak picture: 'He doesn't seem to have that many friends and supporters any more. There was always a feeling that \"you underestimate him at your peril\", but I think that is dwindling now,' says a Murdoch loyalist. The acres of newsprint that were generated by the decision of his eldest son, Lachlan, to quit the family business were followed last week by serious objections from News Corp shareholders about restrictions Murdoch wanted to impose on share dealing in the New York listed company. At the same time, there is a mounting threat from the European Commission to Murdoch's near-monopoly of broadcast television football via his BSkyB group. On their own and in normal circumstances, these problems might be quite easily overcome by Murdoch, surely the shrewdest corporate beast ever to have stalked the media jungle. 'The trouble is, the problems are coming thick and fast, compounding each other,' says a former senior executive in the Murdoch empire. Take the 'poison pill' controversy that blew up at the end of last week. Big American, British and Australian shareholders in News Corp were outraged that Murdoch planned to extend the stand-still on share buying that he put in place last year to fend off John Malone, the Liberty Media boss who holds 19 per cent of Murdoch's shares. Murdoch had signalled to shareholders earlier this year that he was in talks with Malone to end the stand-off and free up liquidity in his stock. Now, it appears, he has been unable to do a sensible deal with Malone, and has had to fall back on blocking tactics that will keep News Corp shares depressed. 'The cure is worse than the illness,' says the former executive. International investors are threatening a rebellion at the annual meeting in October, maybe even voting against a non-executive director. This kind of stick has been waved at Murdoch many times before, and he - with his 30 per cent shareholding - has also called the bluff. This time, it may not be so easy; if Malone backs the dissidents, it could be the platform for a serious coup against the dwindling Murdoch dynasty. Malone has so far not been explicit about what exactly he does want. Some analysts believed he had his eye on the Fox TV channel, and that Murdoch thought this was too big a price to pay. But one thing is certain - Malone will have sensed Murdoch's new vulnerability, and the price for peace will have risen accordingly. As if things weren't bad enough, this week also saw the Barclay brothers escalate their campaign against Murdoch by luring away William Lewis from the Sunday Times to be their new business editor at the Daily Telegraph Now, in the normal run of things the appointment of a business editor is barely significant enough to register on the media radar, but this is different: Lewis has been hired explicitly to lure away those all important AB readers who are the backbone of Wapping's shrinking profitability. As such, it is another notch up in the 'graduated and flexible response' the Barclays have adopted as their strategy against Murdoch. The next move will be the introduction of a three-section Telegraph in the autumn, with high-impact news, sport and business sections. The Telegraph has already cost the Barclays an awful lot of money, but they are not afraid to keep on spending it - as long as it is hurting Murdoch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
