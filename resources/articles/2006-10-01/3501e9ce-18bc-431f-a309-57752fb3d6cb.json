I'm in my third year at university, on an industrial placement with an international healthcare company. I intend to keep a diary, so I can learn from the different experiences I encounter and perhaps use these for examples at future job interviews. I'm having difficulty knowing where to start and wondered if you know of any books on getting the most out of my placement year or some sort of format that I could relate my experiences to. It's a really good idea to keep a detailed record of your work experience. You don't have to do anything complicated; a simple log of your impressions, reflections, high and low points is enough. It's crucial to be disciplined about this, ensure you make at least one diary entry a week. If you need to write a report for your course tutor or placement provider at the end of the year, it's worth taking a close look at what they want so that you capture the right information in your diary. Such reports normally ask you to reflect on the whole year, recording the most important experiences and highlighting what went well and what went badly. Showing how you tackled difficulties and what you learnt from mistakes is as important as describing successes. University careers services normally produce written guidance on getting the most out of a placement year; check what yours has to offer and ask for the free Prospects work experience magazine. The National Council for Work Experience produces a useful student guide which can be downloaded from its site, work-experience.org. What's online in London for a career in photography? I recently graduated with a degree in photography in Ireland. I'm moving to London and would like to know the best websites for jobs in my field Start with the Association of Photographers' site, the-aop.org where the vacancy listings are updated weekly. While there, have a look at the other things on offer. One worth taking advantage of is the free careers talk held on every last Wednesday of the month at their gallery. It's an informal session hosted by professional photographers who are there to give advice on working in the industry. There's a comprehensive career pack on the site and the publication \"Beyond the Lens\" is the definitive industry guide to copyright, licensing law, ethics and business practice. It's important to acquaint yourself with this as most photographers are self employed or working as freelancers. Useful resources for those wanting to strike out on their own are The Creative Handbook, chb.com and Freelance Photographer's Market Handbook, thebfp.com. Photography is an area where speculative applications are common. An online portfolio is essential; if you can't afford a site of your own use one of the free photo sharing ones like Flickr, flickr.com \u00b7 If you have a query for Dr Work, email us at graduate@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
