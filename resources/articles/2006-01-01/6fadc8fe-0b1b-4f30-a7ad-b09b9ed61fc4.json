AGAIN! The Fiver is as familiar with the P45 as it is with talking about itself in the third person when it can't think of anything else to use for an intro. We've been sacked more often than a deviant quarterback employed by Doug Ellis, but even we learned something new about the whole process today when Sven-Goon Eriksson cunningly ignored all evidence suggesting he had been sacked as England coach and told everyone he was going to leave anyway! \"We had a private agreement that - to a certain point - I was allowed to leave after the McDonald's Fuji Mastercard Golden Handsheikh World Cup,\" sniggered Sven, who only 10 days ago said he wanted to extend his contract to 2010. \"It's been very open. I've been asked to win the World Cup and after that I've been asked to look after my life.\" Meanwhile, all manner of numpti ... sorry, dignitaries - Tessa Jowell, Richard Caborn, Walter Smith, Terry Butcher, Vernon Kay, Bernard Matthews and Wayne Bridge - were wheeled out to pontificate on what it all means for England's World Cup chances (the loose consensus: eff all, they're already destined to lose on penalties in the quarter-finals after Rio is harshly penalised for involuntarily beheading the opposing goalkeeper just as Peter Crouch is about to tap in the winner). Sven thinks differently, of course, and he and FA chief Brian Barwick have only one aim left now: getting the World Cup off of Johnny Foreigner and bringing it home where it belongs! \"I am giving Sven an opportunity to take the best England side to a World Cup since 1966. It's my way of saying I have great confidence in his ability to deliver for us,\" gurgled Barwick, as the Fiver wondered why he couldn't have just said it with Cadbury's Roses instead. \"I get on with Sven very well. The very fact he is sitting here suggests that is the case.\" Either that or they were putting on the biggest face-saving operation since Pete Burns delved into his life savings. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Have I any advice for Walcott? It would be: just be patient, train hard and make sure your attitude is right\" - convicted drink-driver and Arsenal failure Jermaine Pennant tells young Theo to do as I say, not as I did. ********************* 4-8-12-16 WHO DO WE APPRECIATE?

Middlesbore striker Szilard Nemeth is going to join Strasbourg on loan for the rest of the season. Bryan Robson has signed a crate of Slovakian gin on loan for the rest of the season. Either that or gangly midfielder Jan Kozak from Artmedia Bratislavia. * * * * * * * * * * FIVER LETTERS \"Re: yesterday's Gary Neville story. You comment on the vile songs sung by Gissagong FC supporters, which are deplored by all true fans. However, you made no mention of so-called Rowdies fans singing about Hillsborough. At least try to give a balanced view, even it goes against the grain\" - Geoff Bradley (and many others). [Apologies. We were clearly blinkered by our fabled love for the MU Rowdies - Fiver Ed]. \"Re: African Cup of Nations. Whilst the Premiership managers moan at losing one or two key players to international duty, it must be so much worse for the African club managers\" - Phil Barnes. \"Was yesterday's Fiver written by somebody with a lisp? When talking about Sven there seemed to be a lot of references to Athole Still\" - Simon Barron. \"On Celebrity Big Brother last night, Preston went into the Diary Room and said of Pete Burns: 'I don't know what it is with Pete, but [he thinks] everything is a conspiracy against him'. As I couldn't quite place the accent, can anyone tell me where this paranoid Pete Burns character is from?\" - Alan Caffrey. \"With Klinsmann in charge of Germany, Van Basten in charge of the Netherlands and the FA's staggering unoriginality when appointing new managers, Match of the Day should start advertising for a replacement for their jug-eared anchor immediately\" - Will Cook. \"For all your amusing allegations of tediousness, league games involving Middlesbore have yielded 67 goals this season - more than any other Premiership side. Surely that's the kind of swashbuckling managerial style the England job is crying out for?\" - Mark Gillies. \"Why not parachute Jose into the England job immediately until the end of the World Cup? Apart from Big Cup, he's got precious little else to occupy his mind and he'd probably enjoy the opportunity to exert his 'special' powers over international managers. It can't be that taxing a job if Sven can do it and his pick of members of the FA secretarial pool simultaneously\" - Terry O'Flanagan. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
