Pietersen's wife, Jessica Taylor,, a former singer with the pop group Liberty X, is due to give birth in mid-May and the player's commitment to being at the birth could affect his involvement in the later stages of a tournament that runs from 30 April to 16 May in the West Indies. England, who hosted the first World Cup back in 1975, have an official aim of ending their 35-year drought in major one-day tournaments, but they also have a long-standing policy of support for players who request time off for family reasons. Geoff Miller, the chief selector, announced England's provisional 30 for the World Twenty20 in Dhaka today and confirmed Pietersen would be given time off even if England make the latter stages. \"I have had conversations with KP and we are aware that he wishes to return to England if necessary,\" he said. \"I am a great advocate of people being solid family-wise, so I have no argument about that. We are talking about the birth of a child and no one dictates when that is going to be. We will play it by ear.\" Alastair Cook, who is standing in as captain for Andrew Strauss in Bangladesh after forcing his way back into England's 50-over side, does not even make the World Twenty20 long list. Other notable absentees are Graham Napier, James Foster and Rob Key, all included in England's unsuccessful World Twenty20 squad in England last summer. If Pietersen did miss the final stages of the World Twenty20 with England still in contention, it would complete an unsatisfactory 12 months in which his status as one of the world's leading batsmen has diminished. He played only two Tests in England's victorious Ashes series and his only half-century, in Cardiff, attracted criticism for his dismissal to an overambitious sweep shot. He recovered from an achilles operation in time for England's tour to his native South Africa but, although he received a more generous welcome from the crowds than earlier in his career, he again made only one fifty, staving off defeat in Centurion. His one-day form has been equally suspect. He showed glimpses of the old Pietersen with a flamboyant half-century in a Twenty20 encounter with Pakistan in Dubai less than a fortnight ago but then began the one-day series against Bangladesh with a fifth-ball dismissal against an innocuous delivery from Shakib al-Hasan, reviving memories of his tribulations against the Indian slow left-armer Yuvraj Singh at the start of last winter. Add prolonged negotiations over IPL security arrangements which have thrown his involvement with Bangalore Royal Challengers into doubt and a low-key England tour of Bangladesh which delays his arrival in India in any case, and Pietersen's career is no longer aflame. The Ashes in Australia next winter, and the World Cup that follows, could define his career. England have yet to check with the ICC if they would be granted a replacement for Pietersen if necessary \u2013 paternity leave is one of the few issues not covered in ICC regulations \u2013 but Miller confirmed that they will select him in any event. Pietersen's possible absence sharpens the selection chances of Ravi Bopara and Owais Shah. Both have been out of favour recently but can press their claims in the third season of the IPL, which begins on 12 March. Assuming they do not pull out on safety grounds they will have roughly a fortnight of IPL to force their way into England's 15 for the World Twenty20. Miller said: \"We will take into consideration how they play in IPL and, if it helps our cause and strengthens our 15, we may well go down that route. Ravi is in the 30 because, if he begins to play like he can play, it would be ridiculous not to consider him. Owais is out there as well. IPL is double-edged. It is a lot of added cricket in an intense international year but it is also an opportunity to play Twenty20 cricket with the best in the world to learn techniques and methods of play.\" There were no apologies from Miller for the omission of Cook. \"We didn't think Alastair was a 20-over player and it is for him to prove us wrong,\" he said. \"He has vastly improved his technique in one-day cricket but we don't think he has crossed the mark in 20-over cricket.\" England 30-man squad for World Twenty20 P Collingwood (capt), J Anderson, I Bell, R Bopara, T Bresnan, S Broad, S Davies, J Denly, S Finn, C Kieswetter, M Lumb, M Prior, S Mahmood, D Mascarenhas, E Morgan, G Onions, K Pietersen, L Plunkett, A Rashid, O Shah, A Shahzad, R Sidebottom, G Swann, J Tredwell, P Trego, J Trott, D Wainwright, C Woakes, L Wright, M Yardy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
