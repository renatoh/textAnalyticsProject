If the insurer, which last week watched its stockmarket value dive from \u00a312bn to \u00a38bn on concerns that the insurance industry was being drawn into the banking crisis, does decide to proceed with the offer, it may need to find extra financing from investment funds in the Middle East and China. It may also need to ask its existing shareholders for cash. It is by no means certain that the Pru will proceed with the takeover in Asia, where it already has much-admired operations developed by the current group chief executive, Mark Tucker. But it would give Pru's Asian operations extra bulk in the 13 countries in which it already operates, as well as scope to cut costs. A third of Pru's profits are already generated in Asia and half of its new business stream is generated there. It is expected to announce tomorrow that while growth in the Asian powerhouse is slowing, it is still rising, as is growth in other parts of its international business. It is also expected to show that its cushion of excess capital is more than \u00a31bn. The Pru, which would not comment on what it described as \"rumour and speculation\", is not thought to be alone in expressing an interest in the Asian operations of AIG, which was partly nationalised by the US authorities. Axa of France and ING of the Netherlands are also thought to be considering a possible move. The discussions are in the early stages but it is possible that if the Pru were able to attract outside investors from the Middle East or China, it would offer them a seat in the boardroom in return for putting up to \u00a31.2bn of fresh capital into the business. The Pru's shares were hit hard last week when Goldman Sachs, one of its corporate brokers, aired the possibility that the insurer may need to raise capital. But the insurer moved quickly to deny it had any intention of conducting a rights issue. This does not preclude the Pru bringing in investors from outside or asking existing investors for funds in the event it needed the capital to conduct a transformational deal such as buying the AIG Asian arm. The Pru is thought to be confident it can withstand a fall of more than 40% in the market from the end of September before needing to consider bolstering its position. Tucker will be all too aware that raising capital has caused problems in the Pru's boardroom in the past. His predecessor, Jonathan Bloomer, was eventually ousted after a \u00a31bn rights issue in 2004. The chairman, Sir David Clementi, is to hand the top seat to Harvey McGrath, former head of the hedge fund Man Group, on January 1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
