Ferguson told the opening night of his promotional book tour in Manchester that he had also contacted Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the League Managers' Association, to volunteer himself if there were any other managers wanting to speak to him. Mackay, another Scot, had contacted the former Manchester United manager during the crisis at Cardiff in which his head of recruitment, Iain Moody, was removed from his position and replaced by Alisher Apsalyamov, a 23-year-old Kazakh without any known football experience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
