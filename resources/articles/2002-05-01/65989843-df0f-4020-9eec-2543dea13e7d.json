In Houlli\u00e9r's estimation, Murphy's selection in place of Gerrard should not be seen as an anticlimax. Quite the contrary. \"If I had to compare Danny Murphy to any player I have seen or worked with,\" Houlli\u00e9r said, \"then it would be Michel Platini.\" Murphy did not make Eriksson's original England 23; Platini would make many people's all-time World Cup XI. But Houllier, at least, is prepared to mention the Liverpool midfielder in the same breath. \"He reminds me so much of Platini because of how brilliantly Danny can read the game,\" the Frenchman said. \"Michel was not only fantastic because of his skill and his will to win, but because he was a great thinker of the game. I worked with him so I know, and like Platini Danny is a bright footballer. \"It is not just that Danny can play in different positions for me, he also adapts automatically to the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition. Danny is someone who has shown only 60% of what he can do. He is gifted, certainly more gifted than he thinks himself.\" Nevertheless, Houlli\u00e9r credited his own efforts at improving the midfielder's mental approach. \"When I came to the club I thought 'This boy has some skill', but he did not seem to produce enough. So I told him that he was not doing the right things to look after himself. I made it clear that if he had a different attitude to his job, then he would develop as a player because he had the skill. Now look at him.\" Michael Owen has never been the target of the Kop's most eloquent expressions of disgust, as Murphy was early in the season, but he \"has followed the same path\", Houlli\u00e9r contended. \"He has worked, I have worked and he has improved. \"I said to him that if he wanted to be a top player he absolutely had to be able to use his left foot. Also I told him that he had to work on his volleying, for which I gave him a couple of tips, and his heading.\" Just Fontaine, France's World Cup record goalscorer and former manager, is scathing about Houllier in an interview with FourFourTwo this month, claiming that the Liverpool manager has been too willing to take the credit and too eager to pass on the blame. It is true that Houlli\u00e9r has proved a little touchy concerning his reputation, not least when he was passed over as manager of the year last season. But on the matter of Murphy's development he has received only due credit. \"Gerard Houlli\u00e9r created the right attitude in my head,\" Murphy said after his call-up on Sunday. \"He gets the best from his players.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
