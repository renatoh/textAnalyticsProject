Discretion is the only power the FA has failed to exercise. The recklessness of the Arsenal and, to a far lesser extent, Manchester United players has met with an uninhibited response. The authorities have not confined themselves to drawing up a specimen charge here and there in a bid to bring the episode to a speedy close. Lauren, to take the most conspicuous example, must defend himself on two counts of violent behaviour and two more of improper conduct. There has been no tactful inclination to overlook any detail. Considering that Patrick Vieira did not deserve the first of his two yellow cards, the captain might have imagined that a veil would be drawn over his deeds as he left the pitch. Those hopes have been dashed. Martin Keown will have to answer for his gargoyle expression as well as for bringing down an arm on Ruud van Nistelrooy. No matter what other complaints are made about the FA, it cannot be claimed to have turned a blind eye to any of the unruliness at Old Trafford. Although Phil Neville has been let off with a warning and his brother Gary faces no charges at all, the unexpected decision has been taken to prosecute Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo. All in all, however, the blame has really been laid at the door of the Highbury club. The tenuous claim that Van Nistelrooy had incited the conflict has rightly been disregarded. The Dutchman, like an affronted maiden aunt, gave a sideways hop in the incident with Vieira but he did not feign injury. An irritating manner is yet to be classified as a breach of the laws of the game. The FA has chosen to confront Arsenal, accusing the club of \"failing to ensure the proper behaviour of their players\". All of this might be portrayed as an over- reaction, considering that Sunday's fracas did not see anyone taken to hospital. There was, however, damage to the image of the Premiership in a match of global interest. The scenes at the end were tawdry and the shoddiness was almost exclusively Arsenal's. Nor was this a random lapse. They could easily have had three players dismissed, instead of just Francis Jeffers, in the Community Shield game with United. For years now, Arsenal have baffled and annoyed neutrals who wonder how so refined a side can have these regular outbreaks of loutishness. The suspensions have harmed them yet Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has still been unable to bring his squad to order. It now looks as if the FA is assuming that task. In the process, it runs serious risks. Arsenal could well argue that they are being victimised, highlighting episodes where players at other clubs have been spared draconian treatment. The FA has no option but to insist on its impartiality but, no matter what denials are issued, the workings of justice are always swayed by external matters. It is naive to suppose that a melee in a shadowy corner of the Third Division would ever lead to such an investigation. The Premiership's members understand the price of prominence perfectly well and this is exactly the wrong moment for any of them to go off the rails. The new chief executive, Mark Palios, wants a crackdown and the ruling body's patience with Arsenal has obviously been exhausted. Whatever else is said of the FA, it has not shied away from challenging a powerful club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
