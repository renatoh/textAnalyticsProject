It's at least a five-setter, asking rather awkward questions about the way we live. It involves the old lions of New Labour just as much as poor, neutered Tiger Tim. First game, first set - and the facts of the matter are dismally clear. There's no Brit left as week two of the singles championships begins. Indeed, there was nobody left after Thursday afternoon - and the wan couple of survivors who struggled on that far were only saved by the rain. This is the most ignominious flop since national records began. A total stinker. Enter the boss of the Lawn Tennis Association, spitting blood. \"I don't think the players are fit enough. Look at them as a group and they've got work to do from the perspective of fitness and conditioning.\" And Tim Henman acidly agrees. \"For years we've been too accepting of mediocrity. You watch some of the players and they need a wake-up call ... They think they're entitled to have their coaches paid for, their coaches' salaries, their coaches' expenses: and that's not reality.\" Thus we encounter our first frail assumption: it's lack of resources that drags us down. Like the NHS and schools and flood defences, we need only extra money to make things right. But British tennis - on any world view - is already cash rich, able to pay all those coaches, sign all those expense chits and plough millions into the grassroots. Wimbledon itself spews largesse. We've got the money, it just doesn't bring the results. Indeed, in Henman's eyes, it's more dozy curse than boon. Who does, by contrast, deliver the goods? The wonder of this tennis year is already Serbia, the benighted Balkan nation last properly heard from when Nato was raining bombs over Belgrade. Serbia's women have stormed into the top 10; Serbia's men are only a half step behind. Where did they practise in chill mid-winter? In an empty swimming pool. Imagine the breast-beating if Britain's finest had to knock up in Camberwell baths. Imagine the opprobrium heaped on terminated Tessa. Yet other unfashionable things seem to matter much more. Look up in the stands for a moment. There's Jelena Jankovic's mum, willing her baby on. There are Ana Ivanovic's whole family, similarly intent. Watch Maria Sharapova's dad locked on his daughter's every move and remember how he travelled halfway round the world to give her a chance. Observe Richard Williams, still devotedly tracking Serena and Venus, the daughters he brought out of the ghetto. We're conditioned to disapprove of pushy parents as they teach their kids to read too early, fast-talk them into the most select schools, move home in search of riper catchment areas. Pushy parents are bad - but crucially good, too, if you want to win Wimbledon. They have ambition and driven dreams to communicate in a sport where you need to pick up your first racket by five. Judy Murray is just as important as her (injured) son Andy; and there is no work-life balance here. You're either (as our new leader might say) going to work hard to change your life - or you're not. And the hordes of the hungry who pour in from Russia and eastern Europe, driving puffing failures into oblivion, come famished for success. Once upon a time, in America or Britain, you fought your way out of the mean streets via a boxing ring. Now the lands where communism finally died want to do it via a tennis court. Their emerging women stars, in particular, see that tennis is the number one game for prize money and wealth. They don't perform better in a more equal society. They play a sport that is all about being alone and exposed for hours on end, with millions watching for every weakness. They drive themselves on because they want to be less - not more - equal. They have sacrifice and obsession to spare. Can Britain match that by building a few more indoor courts or hiring million-dollar American coaches? Perhaps we don't want to. Perhaps, asked to think about the stresses involved, we're happier to sit tennis out. Better to plop along for a droopy year or three then sign up as a BBC commentator, exuding some surrogate glory. Perhaps (with Pam Shriver) we see a western world on a different course. (\"Have we gotten a little fat and happy here, not just as tennis players? I think the world is moving ahead of the US in other areas besides sports,\" broods Pam.) America has only one man left standing in the singles now. Like Australia, it's on a long, fast slide. The old world order changes utterly (except in Britain's lack of success). Do we care? If we do, then we have to start making deeper connections, reaching conclusions that a few extra millions will never touch. Anyone for a little more mediocrity? Game, set and not much of a match. p.preston@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
