Stewart was leapfrogged by Sajid Javid, who increased his support by five votes to stay in the race. The home secretary\u2019s team insisted the momentum was now with him as the insurgent after his defeated rival underperformed in the TV hustings on Tuesday night. \u201cSaj has always had a funny habit of defying the odds,\u201d one campaign ally said. One former cabinet minister denied Raab had been the victim of a plot, but conceded that Johnson\u2019s right-hand man, Gavin Williamson, may have \u201cbullied a few weak souls into transferring their allegiance\u201d in order to knock the former Brexit secretary out of the race. Stewart said he would not dwell on how he had lost the votes. \u201cAll sorts of things might be happening in strange secret ballots,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the end the question for our country is bigger than that.\u201d Williamson, the former defence secretary and chief whip, has been one of the key whips for Johnson\u2019s campaign. In the third round of voting on Wednesday, Johnson substantially increased his tally to 143 votes, almost three times the number of his closest rivals Jeremy Hunt (54) and Michael Gove (51). The chancellor, Philip Hammond, will launch a broadside at Johnson in a speech on Thursday, when the former foreign secretary is expected to be confirmed as one of the final two candidates. Hammond will say any Conservative prime minister pursuing a no-deal Brexit would put at risk every party value, the union, economic prosperity and a general election. \u201cI will not concede the very ground we stand on,\u201d he will say in the charged speech at Mansion House. \u201cI will fight, and fight again, to remake the case for pragmatism and, yes, for compromise in our politics \u2013 to ensure an outcome that protects the union and the prosperity of the United Kingdom.\u201d He will also warn candidates there will be no funds for any of their spending commitments if a no-deal Brexit occurs. Backers of Raab, the former Brexit secretary, flocked almost en masse to Johnson on Wednesday. Raab endorsed Johnson in the morning and by the time voting had begun at 3pm, 14 of his 30 supporters had declared for Johnson. One of Raab\u2019s former supporters insisted Stewart\u2019s performance in the BBC hustings had been his downfall, rather than any dark arts of a leadership rival. \u201cColleagues were interested in putting him through to the debate to see him take on Boris. But he admits he made a mistake, he tried to act the statesman, he didn\u2019t go for Boris,\u201d the MP said. Another former minister confided he had backed Stewart in the last round to see him take on Johnson, but had then switched to support Gove. An ally of Stewart said the international development secretary had been torn over text messages he had received from fellow MPs asking him to tone down his attacks, causing him to doubt his strategy. Stewart publicly admitted his performance in the BBC debate, in which candidates often talk over each other in a battle for airtime, had not been sure-footed. Brexiters were gleeful about Stewart\u2019s ousting. Andrew Bridgen said: \u201cIt is reassuring that there are just 27 of my colleagues who are completely bonkers.\u201d Javid, Gove and Hunt will be keen to gain Stewart\u2019s supporters. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary who is backing Hunt, hosted a dinner on Wednesday night for the One Nation group of Tory moderates, of which Stewart is a founder member. Johnson\u2019s backers have privately made it clear that they would prefer to face Hunt in the final round and avoid the \u201cpsychodrama\u201d of facing Gove, who triggered Johnson\u2019s exit from the 2016 leadership race, though it is unlikely such a successful tactical voting operation could be mounted against the environment secretary, and one campaign source conceded Stewart\u2019s votes are likely to scatter. One of Gove\u2019s backers, Nicky Morgan, said she believed any efforts to manipulate the final two \u201cwill go down very badly with Tory MPs and members ... the obvious motivation for keeping Michael off the ballot is to avoid a competitive race and a real contest of ideas\u201d. Javid\u2019s team insisted he would not be pulling out of the race, and denied he had borrowed votes to oust Stewart. \u201cSaj has never borrowed anything from anybody,\u201d said one adviser. His team plans to woo Stewart\u2019s supporters by stressing their common characteristics and the home secretary was the first to praise his rival after the results came in. \u201cRory acts differently, talks differently, speaks to different audiences, and that\u2019s a message that he and Saj absolutely share,\u201d the source said. \u201cAs we move forward into tomorrow we think we can talk to those MPs. Saj has been written off his entire life, but we think we can do it again.\u201d Johnson added 17 more MPs to his tally. However, key members of the European Research Group (ERG) of hard Brexiter Tory MPs have begun issuing coded warnings to the frontrunner about the limits of their support. Members of the group were reportedly alarmed by Johnson\u2019s refusal to be drawn on offering any guarantee of the UK leaving the EU on 31 October beyond saying it was \u201ceminently feasible\u201d. His evasiveness was highlighted by Hunt, who told the BBC on Wednesday: \u201cBoris has made a big play of saying we\u2019ll leave, deal or no deal, on October 31. Yesterday, frankly, he suggested he wouldn\u2019t be so absolute in that,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure what he believes on this.\u201d Johnson\u2019s backers, including Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the ERG, insisted in broadcast interviews and on social media that they had guarantees the UK would exit by that date. One prominent Brexiter, when asked what would happen to Johnson if he reneged on his pledge that the UK would be out by 31 October, said: \u201cThe same thing that happened to Theresa May \u2013 only a lot quicker.\u201d Johnson\u2019s rivals have openly questioned how he can be keeping the support of soft-Brexit Tories, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the former deputy prime minister Damian Green, as well as no-deal Eurosceptics, such as Baker and Mark Francois. Conservative MPs will vote again on Thursday morning and, if necessary, in the afternoon to deliver the final two candidates who will go on to the ballot paper to Conservative members."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
