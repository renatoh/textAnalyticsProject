That's why when I heard that Singing the Fishing - the 1960 folk music documentary featuring Larner, who went to sea as a lad in a fishing smack in 1892 - had been digitally enhanced, I felt distinctly uneasy. Would digital technology have the same effect on that rich, gravely East Anglian twang as recent computer graphics had on Kate Winslet's thighs? Besides, if the programme that incomparably captured the romance, the danger and the drudgery of the lives of fishing communities in Yarmouth and the Moray Firth was good enough to win the Prix Italia unenhanced, why tamper with it? I needn't have worried. Singing the Fishing was as intact - at least to my unenhanced ears - as it was when I heard a recording some years ago. Seafaring ballads with accordion accompaniment and verses that go: 'The work was hard and the hours were long/ and the treatment, sure, it took some bearing/ There was little kindness and the kicks were many/ as we hunted for the shoals of herring' have the same emotional effect as colliery bands. It's the nostalgia, of course. The herring has been overfished, the pits have been converted into archaeological sites and without programmes like this, a great slice of our musical heritage would be lost for ever. At roughly the same time Sam Larner switched from sail fishing to steam drifters, literary life in London was focused around Bloomsbury, the setting for Radio 4's new classic series, Night and Day by Virginia Woolf. I feel the same about Virginia Woolf as Woody Allen about Herman Melville. When someone asked Allen what, if he had to live his life again, would he do differently, he replied: 'I wouldn't read Moby-Dick.' Ditto me and Mrs Dalloway, Orlando and To the Lighthouse but, surprisingly, Night and Day is turning up trumps. This has less to do with Woolf than Lavinia Greenlaw's tongue-in-cheek adaptation. Usually, when a dramatised novel includes a narrator, I dismiss it as a cop-out. Why bother with a cast? Just read it as a Book at Bedtime. But in this, the comedy - and it's genuinely funny - depends on the narrator, Kristin Scott Thomas, introducing the characters like puppets in a show that she, too, is watching. I wish I hadn't heard Scott Thomas on Desert Island Discs, where, to me at least, she came across as vain, silly, spoilt and ruthlessly ambitious. Knowing too much about people can be far worse than knowing too little. Radio 3's equivalent of DID is Private Passions; Radio 5 Live, being a speech network, has had to come up with a different excuse to get people to tell all, namely Electric Journeys, where famous people are invited to surf the net and chat. It's all a bit predictable. Chris Bonington gets useful statistics for speeches - how many people have climbed Everest and what colour socks were they wearing etc. If only he'd logged on to the Dancing Hamsters or the Harley-Davidson Wedding Shop - now that would have been interesting. I'm being unfair. Shelagh Fogarty manages to prise some interesting snippets from her prey: 'Make up your mind, Bonington,' said his boss at Unilever. 'Do you want to climb mountains or sell margarine?'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
