There is hope that Kompany may be available though given his calf problem is the third in less than a year, he will probably not be risked. The captain has not featured since suffering the latest injury playing at Stoke City in the fourth round of the Cup on 26 January. With David Platt, the assistant manager, subsequently admitting there is concern at the club because it is not a \"fresh injury\", and with Kompany's absence being longer than expected, the defender should be given more time to rehabilitate. Following Monday evening's 1-0 win at Aston Villa, which reduced the gap again to Manchester United to 12 points to keep City's faint title hopes alive, Mancini confirmed the knee injury that Ag\u00fcero suffered in training will definitely prevent him from playing against Barnsley. City are also worried about Rodwell after he suffered yet another hamstring injury at Villa, with the midfielder lasting 25 minutes before he had to be replaced. City are now waiting to see the results of a scan. But having impressed in the 2-0 win over Chelsea, after which Rodwell spoke optimistically of the core work he had done to prevent a recurrence of the hamstring problems that have plagued his recent career, he left the Villa Park pitch \"distraught\", according to Mancini. Javi Garc\u00eda believes the win over Villa means City can still retain the title. \"Yes, 12 points is good for United but with 10 games left, it is 30 points [available] \u2013 it is possible,\" the midfielder said. \"We are City, we need to fight until the final game, and it is possible. We fight for this Premier League title. I think maybe, in another league, it is impossible. But in England all is possible because all the teams are stronger. \"The important thing is the team won this game. It was a hard game, Villa are a good, young team and play very well but City defended very well and on the counterattack we are very strong.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
