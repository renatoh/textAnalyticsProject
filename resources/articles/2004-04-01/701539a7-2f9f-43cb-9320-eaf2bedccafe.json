The two fighters produced what was widely acclaimed as Britain's outstanding bout of recent years with Chi first being announced as the winner when the three judges' cards were tallied but later denied the title when an error was found in the addition of points. Not surprisingly the impeccably polite Chi says he was \"robbed\". Whatever shenanigans may have taken place behind closed doors, Manchester fight fans are the winners with tonight's rematch for the same title once more staged at the MEN Arena. The bookies find it hard to split the two with Chi quoted at 8-11 favourite and Brodie 11-10 against. Brodie's veteran manager Jack Trickett claims to have taken the odds with a \u00a310,000 bet to \"reclaim the loan\" he lost on the outcome of the first contest. \"I just know he will win,\" he says. Chi, 30, fought the Mexican Erik Morales to a losing points decision earlier in his career, and there is no doubting his strength and conditioning. But there is a predictability about the Korean's work and it is likely that Brodie, 29, will try to utilise his superior mobility and adopt more elusive tactics than in the first fight, when his face was frighteningly disfigured by the end of 12 rounds. Almost certainly the fight will go the distance but home advantage could prove crucial for Brodie, who has lost only once in 37 professional con tests, and he could box his way to a narrow, and possibly contentious, points verdict and put himself in line for a summer title defence against the Mexican Marco Antonio Barrera. In a month that will end with Vitali Klitschko's attempt to become the WBC heavyweight champion - and the genuine title holder in most eyes - when he fights South Africa's Corrie Sanders in Los Angeles, Klitschko's younger brother Vladimir goes for the less prestigious World Boxing Organisation version of the title tonight against the American Lamon Brewster in Las Vegas. Vladimir, 28, was shockingly knocked out by Sanders last year but should still prove too big, at 6ft 7in and around 18st, for Brewster, who will do well to survive to the final bell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
