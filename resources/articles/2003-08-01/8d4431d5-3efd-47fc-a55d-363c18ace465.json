Like most people I know over the age of 25, I have always been deeply suspicious of the great outdoors. However, last year I got caught enjoying al fresco living with my girlfriend and our family in Provence. The two children found sleeping on rocks under a badly assembled canvas strangely appealing. But did they really enjoy roughing it? Or would the thrill of cold beans quickly pale? We suspected it might, and we went to Italy in June to find out. We were to spend one week on a large family campsite with everything laid on for us. The next week would be spent sleeping in our own tent on a small rural site free of bouncy castles and supermarkets selling water pistols. How would the two compare? Camping San Francesco, near Caorle, a pretty fishing town 45km north of Venice, is the Harrods of the Italian camping world. Entering the site through the grand arched gateway, you are confronted with bars, restaurants and rows of shops. There is a bank with a cash machine and a laundrette; if you want to, you can hire a bike or go to the hairdresser's. There is a private, sandy beach. Campers have the choice of four swimming pools, one - our favourite - had two child-friendly flumes, loungers, parasols and a bar playing soporific latino compilations. Our home for the week was a Canvas Maxi-tent, one of 10 which were pitched together, albeit rather cosily, along a tree-lined avenue. Our neighbours were two friendly Danish families. The tents were enormous, comprising two bedrooms, a living room and a kitchen. There were curtains. They were orange and plastic, but they opened and closed like real curtains. Canvas courier, Tim, was there to meet us. He looked disarmingly like Darren Day and had a grating David Brent-style habit of referring to tents as 'units', but he did his job admirably with barely a grimace. Unquestionably, Canvas are experts when it comes to keeping fidgety children entertained. There was a tent stuffed with games, bats, balls of all sizes, pencils and, crucially, large plastic toys that squirt water. The twice-weekly Hoopi's club, a rather raucous and disparate gathering of the Canvas children, seemed to revolve around the soaking of a young Italian courier. It generated much noise and considerable fun. Charlie, aged four, spent the week rather precociously attempting to learn how to play chess (or 'chest', as he calls it) and brushing up on his mini-golf. He also learnt a new phrase: 'pinball wizard'. Grace, an indiscriminate flirt at the age of two-and-a-half, filled her days following pole-thin Danish girls three times her age around the site. Midway through the week, the couriers threw a 'street party'. It was not half as cheesy as it sounds. Wine was dispatched, grown men attempted to beat angular Scandinavian children at table tennis and boules (failing on both counts); and our children stayed up until midnight. I don't think we've ever seen them more excited. A Danish accountant called Bent rounded off the evening with a rendition of 'In The Ghetto'. Feedback from the families who stayed with Canvas in the week we were there suggested that this was the pinnacle of the camping experience. Despite having to endure 20-hour drives or more to reach Italy, campers commented favourably on the prices and the service provided by Canvas. On the downside, the site is huge. There are more than 1,200 pitches and hundreds of chalets and there was undeniably a faint whiff of Hi-De-Hi , about the place (the hourly Tannoy announcements in particular summoned up the grim spectre of Paul Shane) but it also exuded peace and quiet. The tents themselves were well-equipped. We got a fridge, a cooker with grill and four hobs, proper camp beds with mattresses and pillows, crockery, electric lamps, saucepans, cool box, barbecue, loungers, parasol, kettle, corkscrew, garlic press and a cheese grater. Frankly, it was better appointed than our own kitchen at home. The fridge, incidentally, is the secret weapon of the serious camper. Without one you will go to pieces. Last year in France we looked on with envy as our neighbours pulled chilled ros\u00e9 from theirs as we struggled to stem the flow of molten yellow liquid from yet another melting pack of butter. It was a drag to leave Canvas, but we were optimistic about week two. The children were smitten last year and at least we now have a modicum of experience. We headed west from Venice to a small site near Padua. Pitching the tent this time proved trouble-free and the first night passed without incident. The whingeing started early on day two. 'Where's the games tent?' 'Where's the table tennis table?' 'When does that small Italian lady turn up asking to be soaked?' When the stark reality of camp Thomson dawned upon the children, the floodgates opened. Other problems quickly arose. Meal times were simple in the world of Canvas. Supermarkets, fridges, tables, cookers and barbecues made it so. Here, meal times were a nightmare. At Canvas we feasted on croissants stuffed with apple pur\u00e9e, hot coffee and chilled melon for breakfast. In camp Thomson we woke to find a half-empty screw-topped litre of Valpolicella on the grass before contemplating a meal of biscuits and warm water. Life, we decided, was too short to wait 25 minutes for a small cup of water to boil. We headed for the nearest cafe and blew \u20ac20. Campfire cooking, is, of course, cheaper than dining out and, oh, all right, quite good fun too. But it's almost impossible without adequate storage. The site, too, failed to impress the children. It was quiet and pretty, but there was nothing much to do. A sad roundabout and a lonely, rusting slide were the main attractions. The pool was too big and the endless streams of bigger children throwing themselves off the diving boards did nothing to help our two into the water. Night times were as problematic. The children improvised cooking games with our pans and filled bottles from the communal tap, but it was no real substitute for oversized water pistols and small Scandinavian children. There were few people there: most of the campers were simply passing through on their way south. Lydia and I passed the evenings happily enough, chatting aimlessly, reading and drinking, but the children were bored and hardly bothered to resist bedtime. One night there was an ear-splitting electrical storm. Huddled together in the darkness, we counted the distance of the thunder together and thrilled at the rain drumming down above our heads. It was a special moment and one which the children still talk about. It wouldn't have been the same in the cavernous splendour of Canvas. Once the rain clouds disappeared, however, we broke cover and headed for the sanctuary, and sanity, of the pizzeria. Factfile Gordon Thomson and family travelled with Canvas Holidays (01383 629000). A 12-night holiday at Camping Village San Francesco at Caorle in Italy costs \u00a3658 for a family of two adults and up to four children for arrivals on site between 25 June and 1 July 2004. This price is the total cost for a family of two adults and up to four children and includes ferry crossing. In the second week the family stayed at Camping Sporting Center near Padua (00 39 049 93400, abelear@tin.it) 7 euros for a pitch per night. 5 euros per night for adults/3 euros for children Flights to Venice and car hire were booked trough online travel agent www.expedia.co.uk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
