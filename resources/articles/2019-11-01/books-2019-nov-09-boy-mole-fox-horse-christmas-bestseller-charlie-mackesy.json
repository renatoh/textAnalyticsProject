But his drawing of a horse confessing the bravest thing he\u2019s ever said was \u201cHelp\u201d became an online sensation. The book that image inspired is now topping charts on both sides of the Atlantic, with Mackesy\u2019s publisher printing hundreds of thousands of copies to meet demand. Mackesy, who has been a cartoonist for the Spectator and a book illustrator for Oxford University Press, says the straightforward, heartfelt conversations between the characters in The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse were drawn from \u201cconversations I\u2019ve had with my friends about what life really means, what\u2019s important; it was a way for me to think aloud on paper with words and drawings.\u201d The first, featuring the horse and the boy, stemmed from \u201ca conversation I had with my friend Bear [Grylls] about what courage really looked like\u201d and \u201cthe bravest thing we\u2019d ever done\u201d. While Grylls may be \u201can emblem of courage\u201d, Mackesy continued, \u201cthe bravest thing I\u2019d ever done was when I was struggling and had the courage to ask for help. So I drew it.\u201d \u201cI put that up on Instagram and forgot about it, and the next thing I knew was that hospitals and institutions had been using it, and the army had been using it for PTSD, it went crazy. I wasn\u2019t aware of it. Occasionally I\u2019d get emails saying \u2018I hope you don\u2019t mind we used it in our therapy unit, it\u2019s helping people realise it\u2019s a brave thing to show weakness\u2019.\u201d Mackesy made the drawing at \u201ca time of life when I had lost a friend, when things make you think harder about what really matters\u201d. \u201cAll four characters represent different parts of the same person,\u201d he explained, \u201cthe inquisitive boy, the mole who\u2019s enthusiastic but a bit greedy, the fox who\u2019s been hurt so is withdrawn from life, slow to trust but wants to be part of things, and the horse who\u2019s the wisest bit, the deepest part of you, the soul.\u201d An editor at Ebury, Laura Higginson, came across Mackesy\u2019s pictures last summer, when the illustrator had already amassed 30,000 followers on Instagram. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a formal proposal from a literary agent,\u201d she said, \u201cI saw it and I thought \u2018this is really moving\u2019.\u201d Higginson met him at an exhibition of his illustrations but according to the author, when he came up with the narrative thread which links his characters together \u201cwe both started crying\u201d. Published on 10 October, the book has sold 51,610 copies according to BookScan. It\u2019s No 1 on Amazon, has hit bestseller charts in the UK and the US, and has been shortlisted for the Waterstones book of the year. \u201cWe initially costed the book on 10,000 copies,\u201d said Ebury managing director, Joel Rickett. \u201cTwo weeks after publication we have 200,000 copies in print and we\u2019re scrambling to find the capacity to print another 100,000.\u201d According to Waterstones\u2019 Kate McHale, the hardback will be a key Christmas title. \u201cIt\u2019s doing exceptionally well,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been absolutely delighted \u2013 it\u2019s such a lovely book, about having courage in difficult times, about love and friendship and how that builds resilience, which makes it universal. People are coming in and buying multiple copies, for themselves and for their friends.\u201d Higginson said that readers \u2013 including one woman who bought 25 copies at an Oxford signing \u2013 were responding to Mackesy\u2019s ability to \u201cput just the right words and images together, as well as the universal values in the book\u201d. \u201cNo matter who you are, what age you are, what your belief system is, there are universal feelings and experiences which unite us all,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might sound fluffy but I think it has come out at the perfect time \u2013 it\u2019s the antidote to Brexit and its values just resonate.\u201d Mackesy confessed he was staggered by the book\u2019s success and fears people will \u201csuddenly realise it\u2019s not a very good book\u201d. \u201cSometimes I wake up in the middle of the night feeling incredibly vulnerable that I\u2019ve said these things and they\u2019re so widely looked at but that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hope it carries on helping people \u2026 Some, I\u2019m sure, will loathe it but for people who it encourages inspires and lifts \u2013 what a privilege!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
