The pledge comes after the Guardian revealed in April that British Paralympic officials were stunned when hotels near their training camp in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, demanded they pay to make rooms accessible \u2013 and then pay again to convert them back afterwards. One senior figure said the problem had been a \u201chuge headache\u201d for more than 18 months until the authorities in Yokohama, part of the Greater Tokyo metro area, finally agreed to help. What made the issue harder to solve is that it was beyond the remit of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee or government. Rather, it was down to individual hotels \u2013 many of which did not see the social or economic benefits of providing more accessible rooms. However, the Japanese government insists the issue is now \u201cobsolete\u201d. Jun Mitarai, part of the cabinet secretariat that co-ordinates Olympics planning, said: \u201cAfter the refurbishments, the hotel rooms will not go back to the original state. That is an agreement between the Yokohama city and the hotels. The rooms will be left as a legacy.\u201d Mitarai said the government was also addressing concerns from the International Paralympics Committee (IPC) about the lack of accessible rooms in Tokyo by introducing new legislation to ensure all new hotels cater more for people with disabilities, with at least 1% of rooms accessible if the building has more than 50 rooms. He said it is also launching a subsidy programme to help existing hotels make refurbishments, and producing a \u201coperational manual which describes how to help those with impairment\u201d for smaller hotels and inns. \u201cThe hotels and inns have already started training their staff based on the manual,\u201d he added. Mitarai also had a message for existing hotels that were reluctant to renovate for accessibility. \u201cHotels shouldn\u2019t view this as a cost but rather as an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cJapan is already an ageing society and it is going to be an even more ageing society in the future. And also the percentage of people with impairment is said to be around 7% \u2013 but those who are travelling are still much much less. So we want people on the management side of hotels to see this as a business opportunity and expand the number of accessible rooms.\u201d When asked if he hoped the Tokyo Paralympics would change people\u2019s perceptions of disabled sport and disabled people much in the way London 2012 did, Mitarai smiled before replying in English: \u201cI completely agree with you.\u201d Part of the problem is that hotel rooms in Tokyo have smaller spaces than most large cities, with narrower doors sometimes making it harder for wheelchairs to enter. There are few bathrooms with grab rails and bath tubs. Some people also cite societal reasons as a factor, with many Japanese not realising it is a problem because there are fewer wheelchair users in Tokyo than in most cities. Yuriko Koike, the governor of Tokyo, said she is determined that more be done to change attitudes and accessibility. \u201cThe Olympics can only be successful if the Paralympics are also a success,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd part of the ultimate success of the 2020 Games must be creating a more barrier-free society in Tokyo \u2013 including widening hotel rooms and entrances for disabled people and making toiletsand baths more accessible. \u201cIn order to do that I am working with the hotel and tourism industry and on subsidies to make that happen for Tokyo,\u201d she added. \u201cOne of the legacies that I am aiming at is that anyone can easily and comfortably visit the city.\u201d Koike said organisers had also created a \u201cParalympic Passport\u201d to encourage local people to watch and try the events. \u201cThere are 22 different sports that take place in the Paralympics and this passport can be used so that you can get a stamp each time you see, play, or cheer for any games in the Paralympics,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd just last week I achieved all 22. I have seen, participated in, or cheered for all 22.\u201d Koike is particularly found of boccia, a sport she started playing after seeing it at the Rio Paralympics. \u201cAs soon I got back to Tokyo I established a team, and when the former head of the IPC [Sir Philip] Craven came to Japan we had a showdown,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI was merciless. I took him down!\u201d Guardian Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.
