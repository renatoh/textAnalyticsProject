The CPB has revised its estimate of its 2016 searches of travelers\u2019 devices including cellphones, tablets, and laptops downward from about 25,000 to about 19,000. It has also revised its 2015 numbers upward from 5,000 to 8,500 devices. With the adjusted figures, the number of times the service searched travelers\u2019 electronics more than doubled between 2015 and 2016, rather than quintupling as previously reported. The service blamed the mistake on \u201can anomaly\u201d in a February system upgrade. Jennifer Evanitsky, spokesperson for the DHS\u2019s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) service, told the Guardian last month that the government\u2019s internal documents contained errors. CBP is currently being sued by Columbia University\u2019s Knight First Amendment Institute for its \u201csuspicionless\u201d searches of travelers\u2019 devices, which lawmakers including Oregon senator Ron Wyden have claimed violate due process. DHS granted itself the authority to search electronics \u201cwith or without individualized suspicion\u201d in 2009. CBP says it has the right to order travelers to unlock their devices; if they refuse, it says it can hold the device itself. The service claims it has never denied entry to a US citizen or permanent resident, but its agents have reportedly choked a US citizen until he relinquished his cellphone and forced others to wait in detention for hours until finally unlocking their devices, according to an NBC News report. On Tuesday, CBP defended the practice of searching travelers\u2019 private data without cause. \u201cNo court has concluded that the border search of electronic devices requires a warrant,\u201d wrote a CBP spokesperson in a statement emailed to the Guardian. \u201cElectronic device searches are integral in some cases to determining an individual\u2019s intentions upon entering the United States,\u201d said John Wagner, CBP\u2019s deputy executive assistant commissioner, office of field operations, in the same statement. But Katie Fallow, a lawyer for the Knight Institute, said: \u201cEven the revised numbers show a startling increase in device searches, raising the concern that they\u2019re being driven more by technical capability than actual need. The government shouldn\u2019t be searching the devices we use to store our texts, emails and family photos, without first demonstrating good reason to do so.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
