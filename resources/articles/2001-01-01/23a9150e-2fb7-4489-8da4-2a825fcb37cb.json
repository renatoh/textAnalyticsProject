If you are wondering what this column is on about, the letters next door might give you a clue. All over the country, it seems, football fans have had enough. Nobody understands them. Not the managers, the pundits, the chairmen. Nobody's bloody listening! Well, they are now. Go to your window and shout, 'I'm mad as hell!' Trust me: we'll believe you. Like the guy among hundreds who rang Talk Sport last week to show how much he loved his club. Now this is mad: his son was born at 12.15am, he said, and by midday, he'd dressed him in his blue-and-white kit, taken him down to White Hart Lane and enrolled him as a Junior Spur. You could see the punchline coming: 13 years later the poor boy had turned into a Gooner. Some people won't understand how that can make you mad. But then some people wouldn't think to have their half-day-old child baptised into the daftest religion of them all. Another woman rang to say she'd just been to her club's training ground with her baby, who'd looked thrilled to bits being cuddled by the players - 'even his favourite player'. I think the child was six months old. There was the West Ham fan who lives in Barnsley. He liked home games because 'it gives you a proper day out'. Then there are the old reliables: people who christen their children with all the names of their favourite team and ask that their ashes be spread on the centre circle when they die. There are the obsessed who've visited every league ground, some of whom, before the trains went up the spout, would go to two, maybe three, matches in one day. Or four, for all I know. (Okay, I've been to nearly 70 clubs and seen two matches in one day. Minor league sad.) Someone not too far from this desk used to log the names of the linesmen at every game he went to. Another colleague once told Alan Brazil he loved him. He was sober. I met someone who knows that Andorra play in the Spanish Third Division. There are people who will take a long time to get over Michael Knighton leaving Carlisle. One of them is Michael Knighton, who never got over not being able to buy Manchester United. At the top end of fandom, we are talking irredeemable infatuation. These are the members of the football church who will never lose the faith. They are the sort of people who will not laugh when you tell them they are beyond help. And they are the sort of people who reckon they are entitled to be heard. Especially when the likes of us are wrong. We do get things wrong, and you are not slow to remind us of the fact.Which is fair enough. It's part of the game, part of the privilege - obligation, even - of being a fan: having a good moan. Sports writers are seen as the lucky ones who don't have to pay to get in. Fans with laptops is the industry clich\u00e9. Reasonable point. But it is a proper job. (Believe me, most of us couldn't do anything else.) Fans, though, always reckon they know more about the game - or, more specifically, their club - than 'so-called bloody experts', especially the ones who miss a foul, don't agree with a sending-off, can't see that Terry Venables is still the best man to manage the England team. And so on. And all week they've been at it. On phone-ins, inside grounds, outside grounds, in the letters pages. It must mean something. There is an edge to the latest outbreak of discontent which goes beyond institutionalised whingeing, however. With fans ever more distant from players through sheer weight of wedge, the damage to the fabric of football becomes harder to mend. What supporters reckon they are losing is their game. And they know they will never get it back. It is no use pretending that the conglomerate running your club will ever care about you again - if they ever did. They care about their directors' salaries, in the main, and looking after spoilt players who hold them to ransom. You - and me - are not even on the map. Some players communicate with their supporters in the strangest ways. Robbie Fowler, for instance. Before they started jumping on him outside clubs in Liverpool recently, they saw in the roguish Fowler an ordinary bloke who was spectacularly good at scoring goals. When he sniffed the white byline to mock stories about cocaine snorting, they got the joke; when he wore a T-shirt supporting the striking Liverpool dockers, they understood. More so than Uefa did - they fined him. And not long afterwards, Fowler approached Robin Hood status with many fans when he protested that David Seaman had not brought him down illegally in the area. Forced to take the penalty, Fowler hit a weak shot - which Jason McAteer put in from the rebound. Rodney Marsh recently said Fowler is the sort of footballer fans can identify with. They just know. None of which wholly explains the latest groundswell of complaint. And the tone of some of it is disturbing. The great misunderstood started the phone-in week with a classic rant: do French players care enough? Anelka to Kanout\u00e9 and back. 'If they don't want to play here, why don't they go back to France?' That was the level of the xenophobia, as it spilled over into Tuesday from Monday. When Kanout\u00e9 said he'd consider leaving West Ham, except a move north would mean going to a strange land that was 'cold and wet with small houses', it might have been George Orwell talking. This, though, was a footballer, overpaid and over here, and it warranted a rare double apology: to West Ham fans for even thinking about leaving, and to all northerners. Then there's Burnley. When the fans demanded that the manager Stan Ternent quit because they went out of the FA Cup in a penalty shootout with Scunthorpe on Tuesday, he couldn't contain himself. 'Maybe it's time up for me. The fans are unbelievable. I've taken the club to promotion, steadied the ship and now we're one of the top 30 clubs in the country and they're still moaning. What more do they want? I've had enough of it.' Burnley reckon they should be reclaiming their glory days. Fair enough. Keeps you going. Sounds good over a pint. But, like the British Empire, it's gone guys. (Cue the indignant Burnley letters.) At Coventry, things have turned nasty. Fans who tried to confront the manager Gordon Strachan after last Saturday's 3-1 defeat by Everton 'went way above and beyond voicing their opinions to the management', says the Highfield Road security officer Bob Rankin. They're looking for the culprits on video. This sort of democracy is obviously in the tomato-throwing class. A level down the food chain, they throw coins at opposition goalkeepers. Real idiots shoot them, like in Colombia. Now there's voicing an opinion for you. The communication gap would seem to be universal, then. ENIC, the company who move into White Hart Lane next month, are having problems with the fans at one of their other clubs, AEK Athens. They reckon ENIC aren't spending enough money on players. *If this is Greek to you, we're speaking a different language."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
