I like the Berliner format, but I miss the broadsheet because it was exactly the right size to line my parrot cage with. I sometimes get the Indy but it's becoming a bit like a leftwing Mail - stories of atrocity and oppression don't have any effect unless recounted in terms of shrieking indignation. Magazines I buy movie magazines - I like Empire - and I subscribe to Private Eye, as I believe everybody should. Books I love the Flashman books by George MacDonald Fraser and I like Carl Hiaasen. A Scottish author called Christopher Brookmyre is quite fun but he's basically trying to be like a Carl Hiaasen from Edinburgh. He does it quite well. I also like biographies but not autobiographies; nobody's entirely honest about themselves. TV Mainly kids' TV - CBeebies, Nick Jr and CITV - because my little girl dictates what we watch. I'm a huge Doctor Who fan and I am loving the fact it's completely reinstalled in the heart of the nation, where it belongs. I'm also enjoying the spin-off Torchwood. Radio I listen to my fellow 6.30pm comedy slots on Radio 4 and I like Xfm. Radio 2 has just become wall-to-wall nostalgia for somebody of my age, which is quite fun - Terry Wogan, Steve Wright and Janice Long, who's playing the same records she played in the 80s. Ads I like the fact that Barry Scott (Cillit Bang commercial) is a fictional character. They invented a pretend celebrity for the advert - quite surreal. I loved the reverse evolution Guinness one - magnificent special effects and anything that upsets creationists is fine with me. New media An awful lot of my fan base, if I have one, is internet-oriented. I've got mitchbenn.com and mitchbenn.org. I spend an inordinate amount of time on Outpost Gallifrey (gallifreyone.com), a big Doctor Who site. Also, notbbc.co.uk is a great site. \u00b7 Mitch Benn is a regular writer and performer on The Now Show, which returns to BBC Radio 4 on Friday"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
