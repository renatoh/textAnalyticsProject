The response this time around has been amazing. It's weird and also brilliant in terms of the number of people who are interested in business as a result and not just reality TV. Everybody wants me to tell them how to get through or how to navigate certain tests, which I can't do, mainly because I do not know. All I tell them is that they have to be themselves, it's no good trying to be anybody else. I wanted to stay true to myself even on TV. I might have been boring or just not good enough but I wanted to leave with my dignity intact. Mainly I was worried about what my friends would say if I wasn't. My peer group can be pretty harsh. I think my experience has helped with this latest round. Basically, the good guy got through in the end. That didn't do any harm. Anyway, I won't have anything to do with this second series. Sir Alan is the true star of The Apprentice. He is a national icon and I am the fortunate person who went through and got a job. Not that this means I'm a success. I'm still making my mark. I spent this week with research groups. With the launch planned for the end of this year, it was time to put the product out to some preliminary market research. For two days I sat behind a one-way mirror listening to what a selected group of people said about it. I felt like Big Brother. I got quite upset when they said something critical, as if it were my child. I feel as though it's something I've seen grow and develop. Then, when they said something good I felt like a proud Dad, grinning all over. It's odd. One of the other things that is odd is my sudden interest in all things to do with the beauty industry. I've gone from someone who was quite happy having some deodorant and aftershave in the bathroom cabinet to someone who can't get enough of women's magazines or commercials for beauty products. My fiancee has seen me turn into a metrosexual, moisturiser-clad man. It's been an eye-opener though. For a start, it has been interesting to focus on the target audience: women between 30 and 50 who don't have a lot of time, partly because they are career women who may still come home to do the housework. You really have to justify the time spent daily on a beauty product and they're not going to buy it because you tell them it has some cactus plant from the desert in it. Having said that, the psyche is fascinating. With the whole issue of cosmetics such a huge part of our society, they still seem prepared to give something a go, just in case it is the magic elixir. It's been interesting talking to Jas, my fiancee. She will choose something because the jar says it improves dark circles, for example. Basically, it says what it does on the tin. I can understand that. It's the Ronseal approach. I've been working so hard, I almost forgot that it was my 28th birthday on Monday. I didn't really do anything to celebrate. I bought some doughnuts for people at work and they got me a card. My little girl got me an Eeyore donkey and a picture frame and my mum got me some socks. No one knows what to buy me anymore. Anyway, there was no taking the day off like I would normally have done. There's far too much to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
