Even if, due to arcane coalition machinations, it is unable to form a government, the Law and Justice party (PiS) looks certain to emerge as the largest single parliamentary group. Pre-election polls gave it a lead of up to 14 points over its nearest rival, the ruling Civic Platform. By any measure, PiS won the argument, and the campaign, and it will be odd if it is denied power. For a watching, apprehensive Europe, the vagaries of Poland\u2019s system of representative democracy are not the salient issue. The issue is what PiS and its eminence grise, the former prime minister, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, appear to stand for: a divisive Euroscepticism, pugilistic nationalism, anti-migrant populism, old-school statist economics, Russophobia and alleged fiscal irresponsibility. A Poland under PiS could make Europe\u2019s myriad problems look just that much more difficult to solve. Yet it would be both harsh and foolish to pin the blame for such a worrying prospective regression on Polish shoulders alone. In the wake of the global financial slump, after the near meltdown of the eurozone and the Greek financial crisis, after years of punishing austerity (which Poles largely escaped) and in the midst of the biggest inward migration surge in living memory, Polish voters are merely the latest electorate to face the watershed choice that is confronting Europe as a whole. It is a choice between steady adherence to the progressively democratic, consensual, socially responsible and inclusive values ostensibly embodied in the EU and a descent into polarising tribalism in international affairs, societal introspection and xenophobia at home, and intolerant, hard-right, hard-left political warfare. Looked at another way, it is a choice between Europe\u2019s 20th-century past and what could and should be its 21st-century future. Put less grandly, the question for Europe is this: is the Orb\u00e1n model right or wrong? For the past five years, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s authoritarian prime minister, has delighted in offering an oppressively deformed vision of Europe\u2019s development. As Ian Traynor, the Guardian\u2019s European editor, noted recently: \u201cOrb\u00e1n does not have a good word to say about modern Europe, whose response to the refugee issue [he describes as] \u2018madness\u2019 \u2026 [He] has used his power to write a new constitution, cow the media, stuff the constitutional court with supporters, purge the foreign ministry and the diplomatic corps, restructure parliament and gerrymander electoral districts. He mocks European notions of liberal democracy and voices admiration for Vladimir Putin in Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey.\u201d Orb\u00e1n, who claims to be defending Christian Europe against the Muslim horde, was at it again last week at a conference of European conservatives in Madrid. Migrants were akin to an occupying army, he said. \u201cWhat we [are] facing is not a refugee crisis. This is a migratory movement composed of economic migrants, refugees and also foreign fighters. This is an uncontrolled and unregulated process.\u201d Orb\u00e1n\u2019s antics are deplored in Brussels and other western European capitals. But in too many parts of central and eastern Europe, and in rightwing western circles, his odious outlook, particularly towards refugees, is seen as justified, even exemplary. Nor have Poland\u2019s hustings escaped the influence of the Orb\u00e1n model. While PiS\u2019s platform differs in many key respects from Orb\u00e1n\u2019s, there are disturbing similarities, too. Kaczynski recently claimed that refugees were bringing \u201ccholera to the Greek islands, dysentery to Vienna, various types of parasites\u201d, in comments that critics said recalled Nazi propaganda. The fact that his words were far from universally condemned was a reminder of how socially conservative many Polish voters remain. The election is \u201cabout whether liberal democracy will survive in Poland\u201d, a leading political scientist, Radoslaw Markowski, has warned. \u201cIf PiS end up governing alone... Poland will become another Hungary.\u201d Across many parts of western Europe, the hard-right contamination of intolerance and bile is spreading inexorably. Following the stabbing of a mayoral candidate last weekend, German security experts and politicians warned of an upsurge in racist and xenophobic attacks as support for rightwing extremism grows, spurred on principally but not exclusively by migration. Already, the number of such attacks this year is double the total for all of 2014. Last week also saw the biggest rally for months of the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam movement Pegida. One speaker, now under investigation, told the 15,000-strong crowd in Dresden that it was \u201cunfortunate the concentration camps are no longer in operation\u201d. Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, blamed Pegida for inciting hatred. \u201cWe can\u2019t yet speak of rightwing terrorism, but the threat is there,\u201d he said. Even Chancellor Angela Merkel, a dominating figure on the European stage, is not immune to the political fallout. Her government\u2019s popularity has plummeted to a two-and-a-half year low. In France, Marine Le Pen\u2019s Front National is on the march. Polls show support rising in the run-up to local elections in December, with the FN tipped to win outright in two regions. In Austria, the far-right Freedom party attracted a record 31% backing in the recent Vienna mayoral poll. Nationally, it has 20% support. Switzerland has also swung decisively right, with a surge in backing for the Swiss People\u2019s party (SVP). Similar phenomena are in evidence in Finland and Denmark. Only in the likes of Spain, Portugal and Greece, where memories of recent experience of fascism remain strong, is Europe\u2019s disintegrating centrist political consensus tending to break left, rather than right. Europe\u2019s changing politics are driven by many factors, not simply by insecurity and the threat to identity caused by rising immigration. Widening post-crash economic injustice and social division, the growing gulf between rich and poor and incompetent, out-of-touch and corrupt national and EU governance have all contributed to the rightwards lurch apparent in Poland, Germany and elsewhere. Fear is the common denominator now linking the peoples of Europe. And at present, few, if any, at least at national level, are successfully articulating a persuasive alternative message of hope. It can be done. In Canada, the youthful Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau, has just swept to power with a message of relentless positivity. Among his pledges, an end to the bombing of Syria and Iraq, more compassionate and inclusive social policy, greater gender equality, electoral reform \u2013 and, yes, an airlift of 25,000 Middle Eastern refugees. If Europe is to discredit the Orb\u00e1n model and avoid a return to the destructive, distrustful, divisive nationalism of the past, it needs champions in the Trudeau mould to stand up and speak for its hard-won values. Democracy is worth it. And make no mistake, European democracy is under threat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
