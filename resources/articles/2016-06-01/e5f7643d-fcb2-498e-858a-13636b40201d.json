Qualifying for a major tournament for the first time since 1958 was one thing. Creating a legacy that extends beyond taking part in Euro 2016 is quite another. Euphoric in Bordeaux and crestfallen in Lens, Wales are determined to leave Toulouse as history-makers. The mood is one of cautious optimism within the Wales camp, fuelled by a determination to finish what they started with that victory against Slovakia in their opening group game. Edith Piaf\u2019s Je Ne Regrette Rien may as well have been playing in the background as Joe Allen, capturing the significance of the occasion, urged his team-mates to seize the moment against Russia on Monday night and to leave south-west France without any nagging sense of what might have been. \u201cThat is one of the huge things that motivates us,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe understand that this is for all of us not just a key part of our careers. It\u2019s such a key part of our lives. \u201cFurther down the line we want to look back with pride and understand that it wasn\u2019t something that we took for granted and didn\u2019t approach in a way that we would not have wanted. I have no doubt that all of us in this team will be in a position to look back and be proud.\u201d While victory will guarantee Chris Coleman\u2019s side a place in the last 16, a draw or defeat would leave them waiting on other results, including the score in the England-Slovakia game, to discover their fate. Elimination would be no disgrace for this team, although Allen admitted after picking up three points against Slovakia that it would now be viewed as an \u201canticlimax\u201d if they failed to make the knockout stage. \u201cOf course it would be,\u201d the Liverpool midfielder said. \u201cI think coming off the pitch, no matter what happens, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll do the business, we want to make sure that we throw absolutely everything at it. We don\u2019t want to have any regrets. We\u2019re confident that we can get ourselves into the knockout rounds and after that who knows what could happen?\u201d The gut-wrenching injury-time defeat against England in Lens, Coleman said, belonged to the past and there was an implication that lessons have been learned in terms of where Wales can improve. \u201cSome people expect us to be on a downer after the England result. But that\u2019s done; we have boxed it off,\u201d the Wales manager said. \u201cWe were critical of ourselves when we analysed it. Out of possession they were fantastic. But it\u2019s just we can be a bit better on the ball.\u201d Allen, playing alongside Joe Ledley in the now-familiar 3-4-2-1 formation, will be a key figure when it comes to the need to show greater composure and the hope for Wales is that they can get Gareth Bale into the game much more as a result. Although Bale has scored free-kicks against Slovakia and England, he has been on the periphery in both matches, to the point that Wayne Hennessey and Danny Ward, the Wales goalkeepers, have so far averaged more passes in the tournament than the world\u2019s most expensive footballer. \u201cUltimately if we\u2019re not keeping the ball, it\u2019s difficult to do what I try to do best,\u201d Bale said. Russia know that only a win will keep alive their own hopes of reaching the last 16 and from a Wales point of view the idea of Leonid Slutski\u2019s team qualifying at their expense would be particularly hard to accept because of what happened when the two countries met in 2003. Coleman was part of Mark Hughes\u2019s backroom staff back then, when Wales lost 1-0 in a Euro 2004 play-off, courtesy of Vadim Evseev\u2019s header in Cardiff. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the first time for me,\u201d Coleman said, when reminded of that play-off defeat. \u201cIt happened to me in 1993 against Romania. Heartbreaking, hence the celebrations when we qualified for this one. But we\u2019re a different Wales team and it\u2019s a different Russian team. So I can\u2019t say my message to my players is we\u2019re going to make up for that loss. It\u2019s a different era, two different teams and a different situation. That was a long, long time ago, these boys will be concentrating on what is ahead of them. It\u2019s about now.\u201d While Ben Davies and James Chester have both impressed in the opening two games, Ashley Williams\u2019s form as part of that three-man defence has been a concern. The Wales captain came into the tournament on the back of a poor display against Sweden in their warm-up game in Stockholm, struggled against Slovakia and was at fault for Jamie Vardy\u2019s equaliser in the 2-1 defeat against England in Lens. Wales need a commanding performance from Williams in the country\u2019s most important match since the 1958 World Cup finals. \u201cThis is what you dream about as a kid,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBeing at this kind of event, representing your country, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve strived to achieve in my career and I\u2019m sure if you ask any of the lads they\u2019ll feel the same. \u201cThe beauty of this tournament is also how much it\u2019s meant to the fans. You can see how much they\u2019ve embraced it and enjoyed it. They\u2019re going into this Russia game like us, can\u2019t wait and knowing we\u2019ve got what it takes to go through.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
