The Band, led by Robbie Robertson, were a touring legend, and they provided much of the soundtrack to Scorsese's own youth. This farewell show in 1976 was a sensational event, with guests including Bob Dylan, for whom they had once been backing musicians. Scorsese's film is a lavish, dynamic act of fan-worship and his interviews with Robertson reveal a charismatic figure. Paired with nervy bassist Rick Danko, Robertson looks remarkably like Harvey Keitel's Charlie opposite De Niro's Johnny Boy in Mean Streets: a charming if complex authority figure with his troubled subordinate. A heady time capsule."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
