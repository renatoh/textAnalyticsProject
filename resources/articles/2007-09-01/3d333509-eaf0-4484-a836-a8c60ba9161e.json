Duncan Ferguson, Kevin Campbell and James Beattie have tried. Even a teenager by the name of Wayne Rooney came up short. Yet Yakubu offered plausible evidence that he could equal Beardsley's achievement. Everton's club record \u00a311.25m signing scored after just 11 minutes on his first appearance for David Moyes' side since joining from Middlesbrough. Joleon Lescott then headed a last-minute winner after Nicolas Anelka had equalised for Bolton in an entertaining North-West encounter to send Everton second only to Merseyside rivals Liverpool in the Premiership table. 'The Reebok is still a hard place to come, but we scored a good early goal,' said Moyes. 'Whenever you sign a new striker, you want them to score as soon as possible and that's what Yakubu did. But it would be difficult to praise him without mentioning Andy Johnson because it was a terrific strike-partnership goal.' Despite hitting an impressive 54 Premier League goals in the last four seasons, Yakubu went into the match having failed to find the net since February, but all the frustrations of that seven-month drought vanished as he side-footed home while unmarked from eight-yards after Johnson had skipped past Gerald Cid before delivering a low cross. It was the perfect start for Yakubu and Everton, yet Moyes' side came close to undoing their good work as Mikel Alonso was denied an equaliser by the woodwork after an incredible attempt from 30 yards. Alonso, brother of Liverpool midfielder Xabi, must have been wondering what he had to do to score, having earlier forced Tim Howard into a one-handed stop. Bolton upped the tempo after the break and were rewarded when Anelka equalised with the goal of the match, the Frenchman's fourth in five games. The former Arsenal man celebrated signing a new four-year contract by unleashing an unstoppable right-foot volley from 12 yards after Phil Jagielka's attempted clearance from El-Hadji Diouf's cross dropped into Anelka's path. In an exciting second half, Kevin Nolan spurned a great chance to put Bolton ahead for the first time but sidefooted wide. It proved a costly miss because Everton won it in the dying seconds thanks to another debutant. Thomas Gravesen, who has rejoined the Toffees on loan for the rest of the season from Celtic, almost three years after leaving Goodison for Real Madrid, marked his second debut for the club by whipping in a corner for Lescott to head home in the dying moments. The former Wolves defender now has two goals and Moyes has challenged him to keep scoring. 'My best tally in one season was 10 goals,' former defender Moyes said. 'But I don't know if Joleon is that good to score that many.' Bolton are heading for a season of struggle having won just one of their opening five Premier League games. Alarmingly, they have conceded 10 times and manager Sammy Lee will spend the international break working with his team to rectify the problem. 'I can't fault the commitment of my players,' said Lee. 'But if you don't keep clean sheets, then you don't win too many games. I wasn't happy with the defending. But it's not just the back four, it's the team as a whole.' Man of the match: Andrew Johnson Although it was his strike partner Yakubu who found the net, it was Johnson who teased and tormented Bolton with his lightning pace and vision. Would have scored himself but for Jussi Jaaskelainen's fine second-half block."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
