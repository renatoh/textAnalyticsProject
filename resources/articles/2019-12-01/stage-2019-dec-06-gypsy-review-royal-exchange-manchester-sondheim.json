Most of the time, this mother of all showbiz mothers is likable only in fleeting flashes. Ria Jones\u2019s Rose is different. When Rose watches her daughters perform there\u2019s a soft smile on her face, as she mouths along to every word of the act. She\u2019s likable even at her most manic. That makes for a surprisingly tender Gypsy, although Jo Davies\u2019 warm-hearted production lacks the dark heat needed to make the musical blaze. The songs that soar in Jule Styne\u2019s score are probably not the ones you\u2019ve heard of. The strident numbers such as Some People, fuelled by years of pent-up frustration, slightly race away from Jones. But the gentler songs, spiced up by Stephen Sondheim\u2019s glinting lyrics, are a joy. Sometimes the relationship between Rose and long-suffering manager, Herbie (Dale Rapley), can feel like a sidenote. Here, it\u2019s the highlight. Their first love duet, Small World, is downright charming; and when Rose sings You\u2019ll Never Get Away from Me it doesn\u2019t sound like a threat. It sounds like love. But this is a Sondheim musical, with a book from the always-acerbic Arthur Laurents, so it isn\u2019t all sweetness and light. This is a show about performance, in all its chaotic glory, and it\u2019s that aspect that Davies\u2019 production revels in. Framed by Colin Grenfell\u2019s sumptuous lighting, the show is a constant whirl of twirling legs, sequinned chests (Gabrielle Dalton\u2019s costumes are dazzling) and cheeky child performers. It\u2019s a lot of fun, especially when Rose and her daughters wind up at a burlesque club where the strip artists greet them with one hell of a show (You\u2019ve Got to Have a Gimmick). But there\u2019s rarely a nod to the seedier side of things. When Louise (Melissa James) performs her striptease act for the first time with stunning costumes and twirling acrobatics, it feels like a celebration. And when Rose summons her now-infamous daughter with just a click of the fingers, Louise affectionately rolls her eyes. Sweet, yes. But where\u2019s the thorn in that Rose? \u2022 At the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester, until 25 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
