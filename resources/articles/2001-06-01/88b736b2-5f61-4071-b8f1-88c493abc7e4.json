Hilary Armstrong, the current occupant of No 12, will have to summon her experience as a former housing minister when she is evicted later this summer, just months after moving in, to make way for the prime minister's growing staff. The move may raise the hackles of Gordon Brown who will find his base at No 11 sandwiched between the prime minister's staff in Nos 10 and 12. Mr Brown will have to acclimatise himself to the sight of Blairite staff marching directly through his pad as they use interconnecting doors to reach each other. The chancellor has already given up a large chunk of his territory in Downing Street. After the 1997 election he handed his flat in No 11 to the prime minister, who needed the extra space for his children, in favour of the pokey flat above No 10. The changes in Downing Street have been caused by the prime minister's decision to beef up the number of officials at the heart of government as he seeks to improve the delivery of public services. The depths of the changes were un derlined by the announcement that three new units would be set up in the Cabinet Office, which also has a connecting door to No 10, to monitor public services reforms. Downing Street confirmed yesterday that the changes have created a need for more office space. The increase in staff working for Mr Blair - increased in the last parliament from 130 to 152 at a cost of nearly \u00a32m - indicates that Downing Street is creating a prime minister's department in all but name. Prime ministers have resisted the formal creation of such a department for fear of creating the impression that they are becoming presidential. Once again there will for mally be no such department. But the treasury, whose tentacles traditionally stretch across Whitehall, has been put on notice that Downing Street is taking direct control of central monitoring. The departure of the chief whip from Downing Street demonstrates the prime minister's confidence after winning a second consecutive landslide. Prime ministers are usually keen to have their chief whip close at hand to warn them of impending rebellions. Traditions will also die out with the departure of the chief whip. Under the Tories, the whips used to drink champagne every morning in Downing Street out of glasses poured by the most junior whip."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
