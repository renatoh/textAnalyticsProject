In this first-class collection \u2013 which repays rereading \u2013 he turns a searchlight back to the ice age (in Bolzano, Italy) and to ancient Rome (where he walks in the shoes of Suetonius) and looks back, too, at the English language. In Lingua Franca, he relishes Anglo-Saxon roots \u2013 language as a vehicle for history: \u201cThe frost and fog of Danelaw, its oafs and their knives / staggered from; the Saxon hog snuffling in its barn, / dung-daggled, furrowing through acorns / in the winter wood. And ice, yonder.\u201d He reminds us that contemporary speech is made up of souvenirs: \u201cEvery time we open our mouths / it rushes out in a skein of colour: / entwined ghosts.\u201d He describes himself as a \u2018blithe scrivener\u201d but must intend this ironically, for his poems are undeceived and sometimes bleak, even though pepped up by his wry wit. If the English language is blighted as \u201cslaughterers pound up the sand\u201d, the English countryside is being similarly blasted, its meadows \u201csilenced of their quivering lyra, / the tiny throats bunged with whiffs / of cancer and formaldehyde.\u201d Nature is victim to a \u201cchemical sacerdotage\u201d. (sacerdotage is, I guess, his coinage \u2013 the \u201cdotage\u201d appropriate in context). In Stuff \u2013 a gloriously sympathetic poem \u2013 he teaches his French students [Thorpe lives in France] the multitasking meaning of \u201cstuff\u201d before taking off on a wonderful riff about the word that ends with the dream of a stuff-free life: \u2026I would like a hut of bamboo with nothing inside save a hearth, some hens, the breeze blowing through. That would be enough. A cooking pot. And the only stuff on the shelves a heap of corn cobs, drying in the smoke. Equally sympathetic is Unperson, about meeting a retired (and, naturally, nameless) Radio 3 announcer who has been sacked. It is a charming portrait of a fellow with the \u201cbuild of a stork\u201d met on a walk \u2013 an \u201corganised hike\u201d. Thorpe strides lightly through the poem, describing his memories of listening to Radio 3, in supportive homage to his walking companion: The long, serious silence of Cage. I tell him how I miss his voice, even after all these years: lying in bed or cross-ankled in front of the grate, struggling with an essay or a poem. Spreading toast. Doing nothing. Life in England, before everything went for hire or askew. Toast may get a brief mention but it is ice that is Thorpe\u2019s favoured element and that makes multiple appearances in this collection. But how long can anything be put on ice \u2013 including poetry itself? He considers mortality in outlandish forms: a cat\u2019s undisturbed skeleton in a London church (Unburied), the uncanny remains of an ice man (Fit for Purpose), the abandoned corpse of a whale in Iceland (Beached). And there is a moving poem (Hoping) about his mother\u2019s last days, in which he casts her as Hamm and Clov from Beckett\u2019s Endgame. It is a poem that demonstrates how much can be achieved by not overdoing it: the nailfile does so much of the work. Sometimes Thorpe\u2019s vocabulary can detain you (he is to language what a botanist is to flowers). Reading The Alarm, I had to look up gryke (fissure between blocks of limestone), vambrace (piece of armour for the forearm) and plackart (I\u2019m still not sure what it means). It is encouragingly clear that language will not dwindle on Adam Thorpe\u2019s watch. But what will survive of us \u2013 if his poems are to be believed \u2013 is nothing as consoling as love. \u2022 Words from the Wall by Adam Thorpe is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a310).

Her face was Hamm\u2019s behind the shades, but her jokes were Clov\u2019s: \u2018Things are livening up\u2026\u2019 \u2018What on earth is there to keep me here?\u2019 A whisky soda on ice was what she craved, and last of all not love but a comb of her hair, \u2018when push comes to shove\u2019, and her metal nail-file that she laid in her palm like a lifeline, gazing down on it for nearly an hour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
