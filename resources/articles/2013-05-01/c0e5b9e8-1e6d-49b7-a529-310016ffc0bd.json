However, police stressed it was still early in their investigations. Hazardous material teams were sent to the area, a police spokeswoman for Baltimore County police department told the Guardian. The National Transportation Safety Board said it, too, was sending a team to the crash site to investigate. The police spokeswoman said the CSX cargo train derailed in an industrial area called White Marsh, about 10 miles north-east of Baltimore, just after 2pm ET. Police evacuated the area within a half mile radius of the accident, but no injuries were reported. The cause of the accident was unknown. The AP quoted a local official as saying no toxic inhalants were burning at the site. The city police and fire department Twitter feed sent several tweets with preliminary information, including initial reports that several buildings had collapsed near the site of the train derailment. Baltimore resident Jason Digman told the Baltimore Sun such accidents are not unheard of. \"Second since I've lived here over the last 13 years ... my neighbor said windows are busted.\" Photos and videos on social media showed large plumes of smoke rising from the scene, while scores of people reported feeling a \"shock wave\" and comparing the explosion to an earthquake. Some nearby residents found themselves uncomfortably close to the explosion \u2013 but kept filming anyway. Tuesday's derailment is one of at least three accidents on Maryland railways within a year, according to the Sun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
