Mr Justice Vos, the judge presiding over the hacking cases, told News Group Newspapers (NGN) he had seen evidence which raised \"compelling questions about whether you concealed, told lies, actively tried to get off scot free\". The judge ordered the company to search a number of computers which he said could contain evidence that its executives deliberately tried to destroy evidence of phone hacking, saying that he had seen emails which showed a \"startling approach to the email record of NGN\". He said he had seen emails that showed how, days after the actor Sienna Miller wrote to the company asking it to retain emails which might relate to hacking her phone, \"a previously conceived plan to conceal evidence was put in train by NGN managers\". The judge read out a section from the confidential court papers detailing the cover-up allegations made by hacking victims against the company's executives and directors. It included the charge that the company \"put out public statements that it knew to be false\", that it had \"deliberately deceived the police\" and had destroyed evidence of wrongdoing including \"a very substantial number of emails\" as well as computers. NGN refused to admit the allegations but agreed that damages paid to the victims could be assessed \"on the basis of the facts alleged\". Earlier it emerged that while the company refused to admit its former directors and senior executives had presided over a cover-up, it agreed that \"aggravated damages\" could be calculated \"as if\" the allegations that they lied, obstructed police and destroyed evidence were true. The Murdoch subsidiary said it had made the concessions solely for the purpose of \"the interest of the prompt and efficient determination\" of the claims against it. Tamsin Allen, a lawyer at Bindmans, who acted for John Prescott, and Labour MPs Chris Bryant and Denis MacShane, said it was surprising that News Corporation had agreed to the admissions on this basis. \"You'd expect an organisation with the resources of the Murdoch empire to fight these sorts of allegations.\" The actor Jude Law received the highest disclosed payout of \u00a3130,000 damages plus costs as payments totalling \u00a3640,000 were made in 15 cases where the amounts were made public. Prescott received \u00a340,000, Bryant received \u00a330,000; Sadie Frost, Law's former wife, received \u00a350,000; and Gavin Henson, the Welsh rugby international \u00a340,000. However, with damages from the other settlements and costs factored in, lawyers estimated that News International's bill could hit \u00a310m. Law, whose former partner Miller had previously accepted a \u00a3100,000 settlement from the News of the World publisher, said he was \"truly appalled\" and \"it is clear that I, along with many others, was kept under constant surveillance for a number of years\". He added: \"No aspect of my private life was safe from intrusion by News Group Newspapers, including the lives of my children and the people who work for me. It was not just that my phone messages were listened to: News Group also paid people to watch me and my house for days at a time and to follow me and those close to me.\" Until a year ago, News Corporation had maintained that phone hacking was the work of a single \"rogue reporter\", Clive Goodman, who was jailed in 2007 alongside private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, during inquiries held by both parliament and the Press Complaints Commission. That defence gradually unravelled as a group of public figures \u2013 including Thursday's litigants \u2013 brought a series of civil actions against the newspaper, unearthing evidence indicating that the practice was more widespread. Mark Thomson, of law firm Atkins Thomson, said: \"After years of denials and cover-up, News Group Newspapers has finally admitted the depth and scale of the unlawful activities of many of their journalists at the News of the World and the culture of illegal conduct at their paper.\" Phone hacking dated back to at least 2002, when the News of the World targeted Prince Harry's friend Guy Pelly, and ran on until 2006 with targets such as 7/7 hero Paul Dadge and Sara Payne, whose daughter Sarah was murdered. Law and his friends were also monitored. At the heart of the hacking lay Mulcaire, who was employed by the newspaper on a \u00a3100,000-a-year contract, and who was a co-defendant in many of the civil actions. Mulcaire was asked by several News of the World journalists to target public figures and victims of crime \u2013 and he also provided information that allowed a number of reporters to conduct hacking of their own. Mulcaire's lawyer Gavin Millar, told the high court that he was \"not involved\" in the admissions that led to the settlements and he was not a party to them. Many of the settlements go back to the time when Andy Coulson, David Cameron's former spin doctor, edited the News of the World \u2013 between 2003 and his resignation in 2007, after former royal reporter Goodman was jailed for hacking phones belonging to members of the Windsors' household. A smaller number include events dating back to the editorship of Rebekah Brooks, who was Coulson's immediate predecessor, and who subsequently became chief executive of News International before her resignation last summer in the wake of revelations about the hacking of a phone belonging to Milly Dowler. Another victim was Christopher Shipman, son of the serial killer Harold Shipman, who was told by police that the News of the World had been privy to his emails in August 2004 \u2013 less than a year after his father's death. News Corporation said: \"Today, NGN agreed settlements in respect of a number of claims against the company. \"NGN made no admission as part of these settlements that directors or senior employees knew about the wrongdoing by NGN or sought to conceal it. \"However, for the purpose of reaching these settlements only, NGN agreed that the damages to be paid to claimants should be assessed as if this was the case.\" Rupert Murdoch's Twitter account, meanwhile, remained silent. But in court, as each of 18 settlements were read out, Michael Silverleaf, QC for the company, said he was there to offer \"sincere apologies to the claimant for the damages as well as the distress caused\" by the \"unlawful access of messages\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
