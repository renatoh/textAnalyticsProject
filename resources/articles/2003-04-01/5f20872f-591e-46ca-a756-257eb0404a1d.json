Wolves will rue yet another failure to hold on to a lead at the City Ground - they twice led in this fixture last season before it ended in the same scoreline - but neither side will be unhappy with a result that keeps both clubs on course for a top-six finish. Although this was the third game in seven days for each team, there was little evidence of fatigue or ennui. \"There was some high-quality football out there,\" said Dave Jones, the Wolves manager. \"If you had offered me a point before kick-off I would have taken it. But having got them on the back foot and gone two goals ahead I'm disappointed not to take all three.\" Wolves were irresistible in the first half-hour during which Nathan Blake, muscling his way past Michael Dawson, and Colin Cameron established that two-goal advantage. After the body-sapping defeat at Leicester on Tuesday - a loss that effectively ended Forest's remote prospects of automatic promotion - the hosts could have been forgiven for hoisting the white flag. However it was a notion that Forest's manager Paul Hart refused to entertain. \"I could not wish to work with a better bunch of lads,\" he said. \"They realise they've got something in their grasp and will not give in.\" Forest's determination manifests itself not in battering opponents into submission but in dismantling them brick by brick. \"We like to play and never get booed off anywhere,\" Hart added. There was certainly no likelihood of that as Forest retaliated with panache. Marlon Harewood and Jack Lester served notice of impending trouble before David Johnson swept home Andy Reed's pass to confirm it. Yet the equaliser was anything but a product of free-flowing football. It followed a free-kick by Riccardo Scimeca that Dawson forced home, the ball just crossing the line before Lee Naylor hacked it clear."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
