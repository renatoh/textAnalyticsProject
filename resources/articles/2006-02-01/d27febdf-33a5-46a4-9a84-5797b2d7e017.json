The 11th-hour move by ministers to withdraw a proposed increase in the retirement age for all firefighters in 2013 persuaded the Fire Brigades Union to stall a ballot of over 53,000 firefighters for industrial action at an emergency conference. The conference was due to recommend a ballot for strike action after the government refused to offer firefighters the same lifetime protection from pension changes afforded to other 999 emergency colleagues, including police and ambulance staff. Union leaders said there was \"huge anger\" among rank and file firemen and women over the proposals, which included raising the retirement age from 50 to 55 by 2013, and cuts to ill-health retirement benefits. Fire staff were exempt from the public sector union talks held with government last autumn, which set out the underlying \"principles\" governing changes to separate occupational schemes, including lifetime protection from changes by existing staff. Local government and fire service staff were excluded from the talks because, unlike the rest of the public sector, their pensions schemes are funded through local government. Pre-tax employee contributions to fires service pensions are some of the highest in the public sector, at 11%. But anxious government ministers decided to act on the eve of the FBU conference to avert a repeat of the national strike last staged during the pay dispute in 2003/04, and agreed to remove the rise in retirement age for all staff, in last ditch talks held last night. Delegates at a special conference in Southport were today told the climbdown was a \"significant improvement\" which would affect large numbers of firefighters. However, the union is still opposed to a new retirement age of 60 for new recruits and the changes to ill-health pension arrangements. Firefighters will now meet to discuss the new proposals and if they are rejected a strike ballot could still be held. The delegates decided that the revised proposals represented the best pension arrangements the union could achieve by negotiation and so decided against ordering an immediate ballot for strikes. A further special conference will be held to decide the union's next move after firefighters have had time to consider the new proposals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
