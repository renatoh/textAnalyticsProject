They lost, as they have always done at the Stade de France, but they were organised and full of ideas and invention. They should have won. It was slightly inauspicious for the great Sergio Parisse that he made the call, as captain on the field and spiritual leader of the team, to take the drop-kick at goal with the last play. That was not his mistake \u2013 he has scored with one before, against Scotland, and practises for such things. His mistake was to fail. It was a poor shot. It didn\u2019t matter then \u2013 apart from the small matter of Italy being the stronger team in all departments bar the left-wing and the scoreboard \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t matter now. Italy should be inspired by what they did in Paris and ready to have a real go on Sunday in Rome. Not achieving a first in France would pale into insignificance if they beat England. That would be a first to cherish. The front five will hold their own and their driving maul is a beast. Even if they dare not overuse it against England, their experience at forming one should give them a good idea of how to stop one. Stop England\u2019s lineout drive and their scoring potential is much diminished \u2013 unless, that is, a green light has been given to something entirely different. In the back row, two players account for 210 of the 513 caps won by the entire Italy team. Parisse, naturally, has the most with 115, but Alessandro Zanni is an unsung force at wing forward. Francesco Minto is even more invisibly industrious. The Italian back row will be primed to stop Billy Vunipola, and even if England begin with the intention of using their strike charger as a dummy runner, Billy will have to pick up the scraps if Italy exert pressure at the scrum and at the breakdown. Yards may be harder to gain from a standing start than they were at Murrayfield. Stopping England is not unfamiliar. But how can Italy score? Carlo Canna played with authority in Paris, but he is now a known product and will be marked accordingly. As will Michele Campagnaro and Leonardo Sarto. Italy have good individual runners but now have to work out the means of releasing them. England\u2019s defence is horribly mean. Jacques Brunel, who appears to be less unpopular than previously thought, has made just the one change to his starting team, with Luke McLean in for the injured David Odiete at full\u2011back. Brunel\u2019s team must believe. They must score early and copiously and set up a second half to savour. And Sergio, the special one, must keep all his wits and skills intact to the very end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
