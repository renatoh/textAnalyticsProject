You can travel overnight to save on hotel bills and make the most of your time in cities \u2013 leave Milan at midnight, wake up in Naples at 7am! Some Italian regional trains are great fun, too. They go everywhere and you will have farmers, housewives and students for company, more than willing to share wine, lunch and lives. Once, on a train from Bologna to Florence, six of us in a shared compartment sorted out a woman\u2019s relationship dilemma: whether to move in with her boyfriend in Florence or do a love commute from Bologna every other day. Nicoletta Splitting up in Madrid Beware of trains that split! Heading for Seville, I travelled across the Spanish plains on a rickety old service \u2013 very scenic and romantic. At Madrid, it stopped for a long time and the destination boards weren\u2019t clear. Leaving my rucksack in one compartment, I went into the next carriage to find an English speaker. \u201cThe guys back there tell me we\u2019re going to Seville,\u201d I said to my new American friend. \u201cThere is no \u2018back there\u2019,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019re on the train to Lisbon!\u201d It took 36 hours to be reunited with my bag, sadly without the camera. Neil Bled bugs bite On the way from Vienna to Lake Bled, normally a six-hour trip, our train was cancelled midway and we were forced to find an alternative route. Eventually, at 4am, eight hours after we had planned to, we wearily arrived at Bled to find our hostel wasn\u2019t open yet. Exhausted, my friend and I decided to sleep by the lake for a few hours until it opened. An hour later, I woke up to my friend shouting in agony. He had been using an ants\u2019 nest as a pillow. Dominic Travel days and local fares If you are travelling on a flexi pass, consider whether it is worth using one of the travel days for every train journey, or whether paying cash and saving a travel day works out cheaper \u2013 particularly in eastern Europe, where fares are lower. For instance, Sarajevo-Mostar (wonderfully scenic) costs about \u00a36 each-way, which is significantly less than a travel day is worth. Alex Creating in Croatia If your Interrailing priority is returning home armed with some killer anecdotes, the sleeper train between Zagreb and Split is a must. Expect three-tier bunks dangling by a rope, a paper sheet in lieu of bedding, and limited bathroom facilities. The journey is likely to be enlivened by beer-wielding backpackers who are keen to make the most of the eight-hour journey, so entertainment isn\u2019t in short supply. What\u2019s more, waking up to daybreak on the Croatian coastline makes up for lack of sleep. Bunks need to be reserved for a small fee on top of the Interrail pass. Susie Night trains save time and money, Krak\u00f3w-Budapest When possible, take a night train. They are comfortable and you save a whole extra day to visit a city, and they also count as one day on your ticket. Night trains usually incur only a small extra cost, cheaper than an extra hotel/hostel night. One leg of my trip saw me in Krak\u00f3w, where I visited the beautiful old town and took a morning trip from the central station to visit Auschwitz. Back at Krak\u00f3w I took an overnight train to Budapest (costing about \u00a36-7 if you pay local price) and, voil\u00e0, was in a new city and on the next leg of my Interrail trip. Peter Sala \u2019Appy days exploring Europe As novice Interrailers, we weren\u2019t brave enough to just wave our passes and see where fate took us. The awesome Rail Planner app allowed us to be virtually adventurous. OK, we\u2019re at Lille station on 9 September at 9am \u2026 where shall we go? Vienna? Twelve hours and four changes. Too long, too many changes. There\u2019s a train to Cologne in 10 minutes ... sounds good \u2013 it\u2019s got a cathedral, hasn\u2019t it? Three weeks of doing that: best holiday ever. Bev Ferry good deal indeed Interrail passes are not limited to trains \u2013 if you want a bit of variety, or ever get fed up with long rail trips, the card offers big discounts on ferries all over the continent. In Greece there are big savings on inter-island Blue Star ferries. And in Scandinavia you can cross the Baltic for half price from Germany to Finland on Finnlines vessels, which are top quality, with five-star facilities such as free, clean showers, cinema and swimming pools \u2013 really cool after an uncomfortable overnight train trip. Nigel Cox Children travel free Don\u2019t assume Interrail is only for the young and footloose. With children under 12 travelling free, they\u2019re great for family holidays. We did two with our daughter before she turned 12. Travelling from Exeter to London for the Eurostar, with UK travel included on the ticket they\u2019d practically paid for themselves by the time we got to St Pancras. With that many trains involved, things aren\u2019t always going to go perfectly, but the beauty of Interrail is its flexibility. Be warned, though, that France, Spain and Italy can be less accommodating by requiring compulsory reservations for some trains. Jon A Border buffers, Italy/Slovenia When I went Interrailing around northern Italy, I was really keen to end the trip by going over the border to Slovenia, but the Italian and Slovenian train networks aren\u2019t connected. So I got a train to border town Gorizia then hopped on the local bus to Nova Gorica, which is the Slovenian side of the city (or you can walk it in about 30 minutes). I then got the train to Lake Bled through the Julian Alps \u2013 it was only about \u20ac6 for a single ticket if you want to save your day use, and the views were fantastic. It\u2019s then very easy from Bled to get trains to Austria, or to Ljubljana. Rachel Looking for a holiday with a difference?
