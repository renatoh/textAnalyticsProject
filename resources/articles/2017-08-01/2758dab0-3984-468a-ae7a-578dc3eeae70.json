Not only did the UK export more ivory than anyone else to Hong Kong and China \u2013 which are considered smuggling hubs for \u201cblood ivory\u201d - it also sold on 370% more ivory than the next highest exporter, the USA. The new trade analysis, which is being released ahead of World Elephant Day on Saturday, will embarrass the government, after a call by Boris Johnson for \u201can all out ban\u201d on ivory exports last month. Mary Rice, the executive director of the Environmental Investigations Agency which carried out the research said: \u201cUK ivory exports are stimulating consumer demand globally, especially in Hong Kong and China, two of the world\u2019s largest markets for both legal and illegal ivory. \u201cThe UK Government should stop issuing permits for all ivory exports with immediate effect, not least to show solidarity with the Hong Kong and Chinese governments which have both committed to closing their domestic ivory markets.\u201d Domestic ivory trading in China is due to be banned by the year\u2019s end, while the EU last month prohibited the export of \u201craw\u201d ivory \u2013 whole tusks, ivory chunks or scraps. International rules still allow Britain and other countries to legally export ivory when it is certified as having been \u201cworked\u201d or \u201ccarved\u201d before 1976. And the UK government has dragged its heels over taking action, quietly dropping a 2015 manifesto pledge to \u201cpress for a total ban on ivory sales\u201d in the summer election campaign earlier this year. Antique ivory products manufactured before 1947 \u2013 such as billard balls, piano keys and chess pieces - are also legal and do not need a certificate, providing their age can be established. Campaigners say that this creates a loophole, allowing ivory sawed from the 30,000 elephants killed for their tusks each year, to enter the market. \u201cAs well as fuelling demand for ivory, the UK\u2019s legal trade provides opportunities for the laundering of illegal ivory, both within the country and internationally,\u201d Rice said. The Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder who has campaigned on the issue, said: \u201cThis huge amount of trade going through the UK shames us all. It creates and sustains a market that needs to be shut down. \u201cThe government should recognise that this is crisis time for elephants. On our watch, we could see the extinction of the majority of elephants in most of their range countries. We have to stand up and say that this is not acceptable.\u201d The UK is hosting an international conference on halting illegal wildlife trade next year, but its colonial history has bequeathed it a stockpile of ivory artefacts wrenched from more than a million elephants, on some estimates. Around 30,000 tonnes of ivory were shipped out of Africa \u2013 much of it using slave labour \u2013 during the days of empire. A spokesperson for the Department for environment, food and rural affairs said: \u201cProtecting elephants and ending the illegal ivory trade is a priority for us, which is why we have invested \u00a326m since 2014 to tackle this insidious industry. However, this is not the end of our ambition as we will continue our role as a global leader in the fight against the illegal ivory trade.\u201d Hopes for a move towards a total ban were buoyed by a parliamentary statement from the foreign secretary last month. Questioned about official policy on the bloody trade, Boris Johnson said that the government was committed to an all-out ivory ban \u201cand that is what we intend to pursue\u201d. However, some MEPs fear that a removal of EU regulatory oversight coupled with the prioritisation of trade issues after Brexit may obstruct conservation efforts. \u201cIf the government has to go cap in hand to other countries for trade deals, I\u2019m really concerned that we might start seeing a slip in standards,\u201d Bearder said. Between 2010 and 2012, the USA was the main destination for UK ivory imports but this changed dramatically between 2013 and 2015, as exports to Hong Kong and China surged ahead, the data breakdown shows. Italy overtook Britain as the world\u2019s largest single ivory seller in 2015, but the UK cumulatively consigned more ivory than the next four biggest exporting countries over the five-year period between 2010 and 2015. Last month two tonnes of ivory were crushed in Central Park in New York. The US now has far stronger restrictions on the sale or resale of ivory than the UK."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
