Green collars have joined the employment wardrobe of blue collars, white collars and pink collars (so-called \"female\" jobs, such as care assistants or florists, and not white collars that were put in the wash with a rogue sock) and refer to manual-labour jobs in the new ecological economy, from mending bicycles to cladding buildings in solar panels. As much as a quarter of the US workforce could have a \"green\" job by 2030, says the American Solar Energy Society. \"The potential for job creation is vastly underestimated,\" says Dave Timms, economics campaigner for Friends of the Earth. \"[Our] government needs to get stuck in and create a low-carbon economy through regulation, not leave it to market forces.\" On the surface, green-collar jobs look like a good thing - as well as the environmental benefits, they would provide new employment, especially for manufacturing workers whose jobs have been outsourced - but Pat Thomas, editor of the Ecologist, is unsure. \"Many progressive economists feel that a sustainable society won't be able to provide full employment because in a world where we don't produce more than we need, there is less to buy and there are fewer services required,\" she says. \"We can't talk green sustainable jobs until we have talked green sustainable economy. And once you start that conversation you open a whole can of worms that most politicians don't want to open. That's why they make shallow promises and come up with buzzy phrases that capture people's imaginations but don't force them to think too hard.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
