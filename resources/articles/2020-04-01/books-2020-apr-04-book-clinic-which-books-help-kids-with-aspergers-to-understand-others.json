Which children\u2019s novels would best give him an insight into how other people work? Anonymous, 44, Cardiff A: Jasbinder Bilan is the author of Asha &amp; the Spirit Bird, winner of the 2019 Costa Children\u2019s Book award. She writes: Understanding each other and why we do things is a challenge for most teenagers, so when this tough phase of life is coupled with an additional need such as Asperger\u2019s, novels can help us learn. Living life through your character\u2019s eyes develops empathy. Reading together gives a chance to discuss the story and ask the all-important question \u2013 what would you do in their shoes? First up is a classic, and one that my boys loved: Michael Morpurgo\u2019s Alone on a Wide Wide Sea. The beauty of this story of an orphan travelling alone to Australia is the number of new people and situations Arthur encounters, and how he deals with them. The Boy With the Butterfly Mind by Victoria Williamson gives an insight into the lives of Jamie, who has ADHD, and Elin as they navigate family dynamics and take on huge changes, helping each other accept themselves for who they truly are. The teen years are all about confidence, so Step Into Your Power by Jamia Wilson is a wonderful manual to help you become the person you want to be. Use it to discuss what\u2019s important to your son and help him navigate his world. When Fred, Con, Lila and Little Max\u2019s plane divebombs and crashes in the Amazon, they have to work together if they are to survive. Katherine Rundell\u2019s The Explorer gives the chance to travel to a new world full of excitement and danger, in this story of adventure and friendship. Now or Never: A Dunkirk Story by Bali Rai is based on true events. It follows Fazal Khan of Company 32 on a journey from his home in northern India to the battlefields of France during the second world war. Finally, social justice is something that provokes strong feelings in children, and Here I Stand, written by a range of outstanding children\u2019s authors, gives a chance to travel deeper into the lives of young people and their liberties, exploring some hard-hitting but necessary themes.
