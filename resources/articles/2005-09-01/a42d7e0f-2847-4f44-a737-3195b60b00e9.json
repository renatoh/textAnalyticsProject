Last month the organisers of the London film festival announced that this year's event would be book-ended by screenings of Fernando Meirelles's The Constant Gardener and George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck. At this morning's press launch they helpfully filled in the rest of the programme. Among the big American films being unveiled this year are the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and The Brothers Grimm, by Terry Gilliam. British cinema is spearheaded by Julian Fellowes's Separate Lies, a plush, Somerset Maugham-esque murder mystery starring Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson, and by A Cock and Bull Story, director Michael Winterbottom's unorthodox take on Tristam Shandy. Elsewhere the festival plays host to a number of pictures that were first seen at last May's Cannes film festival. These include Lars von Trier's Manderlay, Michael Haneke's Hidden, Dominik Moll's Lemming and eventual Palme d'Or-winner L'Enfant, by the Dardennes brothers. Other major films playing at the festival are John Madden's Proof, Steven Soderbergh's experimental Bubble, Liev Shreiber's adaptation of Everything is Illuminated and the surprise documentary hit March of the Penguins. But the 49th London film festival also offers a range of smaller, more obscure features and shorts from around the globe. \"It is a festival where films made by David can stand harmoniously alongside films made by Goliath,\" said BFI director Amanda Nevill. The 49th London film festival runs October 19-November 3."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
