Far from being granted the \u00a350m that earlier this season he claimed he needed to make Spurs a championship-winning team, it seems the manager will receive only a fraction of the money wanted to restore the north London club to former glories. The message from Graham after meeting Tottenham's new executive vice-chairman David Buchler 24 hours earlier is that \"big outlays\" on new players are unlikely, either before next Thursday's transfer deadline or, more importantly, in the summer to transform the squad before a season that could see European football back at Tottenham. Graham has bemoaned Spurs' lack of strength in depth and must have been disappointed by Enic's response. But he would not specify his budget. \"We need to strengthen the squad so we don't get into another situation like this year where we have had to sling in the youngsters,\" he said. \"I hope to get players in, hopefully before next Thursday's deadline. \"Only time will answer whether there will be some action. All I can do is recommend players, and I'll soon find out if I'm going to get those players.\" Closing this season by wining the FA Cup - and claiming their arch-rivals Arsenal's scalp on the way - would of course enhance Tottenham's funds and Graham's own stock, which is still not high with many Spurs fans. Graham told Buchler he felt \"we should do our utmost to keep\" Sol Campbell - an Arsenal target - and Les Ferdinand and Darren Anderton, although Anderton's future with Spurs has been compromised by being ruled out for at least another two weeks. He has had his leg put back in plaster and will miss the semi-final with Arsenal on April 8. But Graham is hopeful \"he will play again this season\". Graham revealed little new about his own future. \"The new owners want success from me and they are probably hoping that, with my CV, I can do it again. But my own contract situation never arose, and it is not up until the end of next season.\" Graham's disclosure that his budget is limited might deter big-name candidates to succeed him if he is ousted by the new regime in the summer. Arsenal have pulled out of a deal for the Germany defender Marko Rehmer because they feel he is overpriced under the new transfer system, according to his agent. Jorg Neubauer said: \"Marko had reached an agreement with Arsenal but... they believe \u00a35m is rather a lot of money for a player who's nearly 29 and who could only be tied to his new club for two years.\" Stan Collymore has rejected a return to Southend, the club where he made his name. The striker, who has just announced his retirement after a spell with Real Oviedo, is seeking a Hollywood career."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
