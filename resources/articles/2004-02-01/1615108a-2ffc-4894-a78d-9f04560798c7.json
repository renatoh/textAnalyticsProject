Robbie Earnshaw, playing only because of injuries to John Hartson and Craig Bellamy, took only 44 seconds to score and went on to complete a hat-trick after 58 minutes. Wales' manager Mark Hughes later showered praise on the Cardiff striker, saying: \"Rob was electric all night - Scotland couldn't cope with his energy. He's got frightening pace and defenders don't like that. It was a great performance all round from start to finish. I told them they should be very proud of themselves. \" Gareth Taylor delivered Wales' fourth goal and the performance will greatly encourage them before their World Cup qualifying campaign battles with England. Scotland's future look bleak. They were thrashed 6-0 by Holland in Amsterdam in their last match and the Welsh would have matched that half-dozen but for some profligate finishing. In Dublin, the Republic of Ireland thoroughly deserved to hold a Brazil side featuring eight of their World Cup winners to a 0-0 draw. With sharper finishing, Lansdowne Road could have been sent into wild celebration. John O'Shea and Stephen Carr both came close to giving Brian Kerr's side the lead in the first half and Robbie Keane put a second-half header over the bar when it looked easier to score. Ronaldo and Kaka had a quiet night up front for the Brazilians and their best effort came from Ronaldinho, who grazed the crossbar with a 74th-minute effort from the edge of the area. Northern Ireland at last scored a goal, their first for two years and five days, to end one of the bleakest sequences in world football, as consolation in a 4-1 defeat by Norway in Belfast. Preston's Healy was the Ulsterman to end the extraordinary drought, striking after 57 minutes. But by then the Norwegians were 3-0 ahead and an own goal by Leicester's Keith Gillespie sealed Northern Ireland's latest defeat. Thus ended Lawrie Sanchez's hopes of marking his first match in charge with victory - a sensation Northern Ireland last enjoyed in October 2001, against the might of Malta."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
