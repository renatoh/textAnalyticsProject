Persistent investigation by the magazine, including freedom of information requests, forced Hendy to reveal that the chosen firm, Heatherwick, had the highest quote of three bidders in the competition to design the concept for the bridge, but was nevertheless said by TfL to be the most \u201ceconomically advantageous\u201d. Heatherwick\u2019s \u00a3173,000 fee was more than three times more expensive than the \u00a349,939 offer by Wilkinson Eyre, and more than 11 times that of the \u00a315,125 offer by Marks Barfield. Hendy wrote this week to Caroline Pidgeon, the leader of the Liberal Democrats on the London assembly, revealing that he had ordered a review of the procurement process and promising to publish its findings. His letter revealed the massive cost of the Heatherwick estimate for the first time, after it was redacted from FoI responses to Architects\u2019 Journal. But Hendy insisted the estimates \u201cdid not form part of the formal judging\u201d and claimed the decision had been made on the basis of day rates. Those rates remain secret for \u201creasons of commercial sensitivity\u201d, he said, adding the \u201cactual value of the work undertaken [by Heatherwick] under this contract was \u00a352,000\u201d. The latest revelations come amid a growing backlash against the \u00a3175m project. Opponents have called for a parliamentary inquiry into the misuse of public funds for a scheme that was initially proposed as a privately funded initiative. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and the chancellor, George Osborne, have each pledged \u00a330m of public money for the project, ignoring concerns that what is being created amounts to a privately managed tourist landmark rather than a bridge. Details of how the bridge would operate indicate there will be limits on group sizes, suggesting a ticketing system may be required. It would be closed once a month for corporate events and between midnight and 6am. Plans for cycle lanes have been scrapped. Michael Ball, director of the Waterloo Community Development Group, has claimed the cost of the project could fund 30 new London parks or 30 times the amount of open space the bridge would provide. The garden bridge was also mentioned in the conclusions of a recent inquiry into procurement by the London assembly, which recommended that the public ought at least to have free access to the bridge in return for \u00a330m funding. Architects\u2019 Journal has pointed out that TfL rated Heatherwick highest for \u201crelevant design experience\u201d despite competition from firms that are far more experienced in building bridges. It also found that Joanna Lumley, the actor and campaigner, had in 2012 personally lobbied Johnson on Heatherwick\u2019s behalf.
