My main theme was globalisation and its impact on our lives. Given the nature of the topic, we decided upon an innovation. Why not use the lectures to stimulate a global debate about globalisation? I delivered three of the five lectures at different points around the world, Delhi, Hong Kong and Washington, in front of live audiences. For the first time in the history of the Reith Lectures, Radio 4 and the World Service collaborated in bringing them to a worldwide audience. The Service organised an internet debate, questions and responses from which were fed into the studio discussion, and then back on to the internet. Thousands of people participated, and the debate continued for a full year after the final lecture. The fact that we were able to draw in people from so many countries was a testament to the extraordinary influence of the World Service, whose 70th birthday falls on Thursday. The event will be marked by programmes transmitted from Table Mountain in South Africa. It was from there that one of the Service's first overseas re-broadcasts was sent out. Preceding this there is to be a \"global party\", with contributions from London, Dakar, Kabul, Mexico City and Mumbai. Globalisation, as I stressed in my lectures, is not just an abstract notion. It is real, it is moving fast, and it is here to stay. The simplest definition of globalisation is interdependence. We are all much more interdependent with one another, rich and poor alike, than was true for any previous generation. Globalisation is not solely, or even primarily, brought about by the integration of the world marketplace. It is driven, above all, by the advance of communications, which is creating a world where \"no one is outside\". As an organisation of global spread already, the Service should be ideally placed to take advantage of such developments. It claims 150 million listeners from around the world as its audience each week. Broadcasts go out in 43 languages besides English. The Service is available on short wave almost everywhere in the world, as well as on FM in 136 capital cities. A constant stream of news in each of the 44 languages is available on its award-winning website. The Service won a great deal of acclaim (and more awards) for its coverage of the two seminal events of 2001 - September 11 and the ensuing war in Afghanistan. As a result of these efforts it was put forward for the Nobel Peace prize this year. It didn't win - the prize went to former US president Jimmy Carter - but the case was certainly a credible one. It is said that the protagonists on both sides listened regularly to the Service to get objective information about what was going on. But the Service has suffered its share of strains and difficulties in the recent past and there are major problems looming ahead. It was not Mrs Thatcher's favourite broadcaster and had to struggle for funding under the Conservatives. In 2001 an outcry was caused when the BBC decided that short-wave broadcasts to North America and the Pacific were to be dropped. These were supposed to be replaced by satellite radio, but the path for this medium has proved anything but smooth. The Service is in a better financial position overall than it has been for many years. Its annual budget of \u00a3201m is to increase to \u00a3239m by 2005-6. Yet, as a public service broadcaster, it is forever vulnerable to cutbacks driven by political decisions. More important, the very process of globalisation - which on the face of things affirms its importance - is a fundamental source of threat too. The social, cultural and technological changes involved in globalisation are transforming the environment in which the Service works. With TV, video and movies being joined by a variety of other recently developed media, especially digital media, the communications landscape has altered massively. Together with the deregulation of many areas of broadcasting, these innovations have created a far more competitive milieu for the Service. Moreover, as poorer countries develop, their reliance on radio, especially overseas radio, tends to drop. The head of the World Service, Mark Byford, and his colleagues are only too aware of the dangers ahead. To meet them, they are seeking to break away from the fusty-but-worthy image it has in some quarters. It will be a struggle, but one that devotees like myself fervently hope that the Service can win. \u00b7 Anthony Giddens is director of the London School of Economics"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
