Flicking through them I was reminded of a number of things - among them that Stirling Moss won the British Lawnmower grand prix twice in the 70s, that Mike Petke of the Metrostars was sent off for kissing the ball after fouling DC United's Jaime Moreno and that the restart of the England Under-21s game with the Netherlands was delayed by several minutes because the pea in the referee's whistle had frozen. Tragically I never got to use any of these fascinating facts, or dozens of others the details of which I had diligently recorded. This year's notebooks are much the same, filled to the brim with incidents that bring to mind David O'Leary's description of Lee Bowyer: \"I used to describe him as a freak, meaning it in the best possible sense.\" Here is a selection. Having finished third in last year's South American Cricket Championship Brazil is granted affiliate membership of the ICC. Norman Baldwin of the Brazilian Cricket Association is encouraged but realistic. \"The fielding of Brazilian players is weak and bowling with a straight-arm is always a problem,\" he says. There are logistical difficulties too. \"The nearest cricket shop is in Cape Town, so equipment is hard to replace.\" Marc Geraert, a football referee from Ypres, ends a West Flanders league game between FC Wijtschate and Vladslo prematurely to save Wijtschate from further punishment. The team from Heuvelland were losing 16-0 at the time. \"I felt so sorry for them,\" Geraert explained. Wijtschate were used to it, though, having conceded 132 goals in15 games. \"All our players are farm boys,\" explains a club spokesman. The prize for being 10 millionth visitor to the Nou Camp in Barcelona is won by a woman from Stockport. Jordan, the model and mother, revealed that Dwight Yorke used to wind up Sir Alex Ferguson by sitting on the subs' bench ostentatiously chewing gum. Fresh from pummelling Paula Jones in a celebrity boxing match the headline-grabbing, hubcap-wielding former ice-skater Tonya Harding threatens to sue an Oregon company which began marketing a barbecue sauce named after her. According to Harding's lawyer, the label of Tonya Hot Sauce - \"Not for the weak-kneed. Guaranteed to assault your taste buds\" - portrays Tonya Harding as cigarette smoking, bubblegum-chewing trailer trash, and that is not who she is. The cheerful golfer Colin Montgomerie tells the nation how he lost weight. \"I only eat half of everything that's on my plate,\" he says. The government of Uzbekistan bans billiards and abolishes the national association because it believes the game is corrupting national morals. Dilshod Nazirov, a spokesman for Tashkent city council, says that the billiard halls he visited were thick with tobacco smoke, smelled of alcohol and that billiards is not even a sport. A 33-foot statue of the hayrick-haired Colombian midfield stroller Carlos Valderrama was erected in his hometown of Santa Maria. A holiday resort in Sicily names a row of public toilets after Byron Moreno, the Ecuadorian referee blamed by Italians for their nation's World Cup quarter-final defeat by South Korea. Back in his native land the wombat-like official celebrates by allowing 12 minutes of injury-time in a game between Barcelona de Guayaquil and LDU of Quito. He is subsequently suspended. A streaker clambers over the plexiglass protective wall and runs on to the rink during an NHL game between Calgary Flames and the Boston Bruins. He slips on the ice, knocks himself unconscious and has to be removed on a stretcher. In an auction at Sotheby's a piece of Red Rum's tail fetches \u00a3529. In an upmarket version of the old \u00a310 and a box of kippers transfer deal the Norwegian third division striker Kenneth Kristensen moves from Vindbjart to Flekkeroy for his weight in fresh prawns. Flekkeroy boss Rolf Guttormsen says that other fees were discussed \"but they wanted the prawns and so we had no choice\". The Dutch non-league side Putbroek cover their pitch in human hair in a bid to deter a herd of wild pigs that have been digging up the turf in search of worms. \"Pigs have a well developed sense of smell,\" a spokesman says. \"As soon as they catch a human scent they run away, never to return.\" Police sniffer dogs working at the Arthur Ashe stadium during the US Open are ordered to wear ID tags by stadium security staff. The Great Ontario Salmon Hunt's \u00a3416,000 first prize proves too much of a temptation for one angler who is charged with fraud after judges discover that his top catch, a 34lb fish, contains 7lb of lead shot. In Hay, New South Wales, Peter Desailey wins the final of the Australian sheep counting championships by accurately counting 277 of them. His opponent is one out with 278. The match between Brazilian giants Botafogo and Gremio ends in controversy when three minutes from time, with the score 1-1, a goal-bound shot from Botafogo's Fabio is deflected past the post by a lapwing. \"Had the damn bird not crossed the line of the shot I would have scored the winner,\" he fumes. Asked if the bird was hurt in the incident Fabio's team-mate Ademilson snaps, \"Unfortunately not\". The Portuguese name for the local breed of peewit is quero-quero."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
