The Liverpool manager also hopes to secure Blackburn Rovers' Damien Duff to play alongside Ciss\u00e9 with the pair costing a combined \u00a325m, a bold outlay given the depressed transfer market and that the \u00a318m spent at Anfield last summer failed to earn even a top-four finish. The extra funds required will be generated by sales from the current squad with Emile Heskey, Vladimir Smicer, Markus Babbel and Dietmar Hamann most likely to move on. Houllier will meet his close friend Guy Roux after Auxerre play Paris St-Germain in the French Cup final on May 31 to discuss Ciss\u00e9, who is being courted by Marseille and Barcelona, though he is understood, like Duff, to favour a move to Anfield. The 21-year-old has scored 14 goals this season and has four years to run on his current contract, with Roux having already stated that he will follow the striker out of Auxerre should he be sold. That stance should mellow after the final at Stade de France. \"There are various things we want to raise at the meeting, not only for this season but for the future,\" said Houllier, who was forced to postpone the talks from a fortnight ago after Auxerre progressed to the cup final. \"There are a couple of players we are interested in - we are not only going to talk solely about Ciss\u00e9.\" Houllier will find securing Auxerre's centre-half Jean Alain Boumsong, who has 12 months remaining on his contract and would cost around \u00a32m, easier than prising Ciss\u00e9 away, while the 24-year-old Duff has been a long-standing target for Liverpool and Manchester United, though the Frenchman appears to have pipped Sir Alex Ferguson to his signature. \"We made an offer last season and they said he wasn't for sale,\" said Houllier, who is aware that, though Duff boasts an \u00a318m get-out clause in his contract at Ewood Park, Rovers are likely to accept around \u00a312m as they pursue their own summer-spending plans ahead of a Uefa Cup campaign. \"He's not the only target we have, but we need a bit of creativity between midfield and the strikers. If they [the board] give me the money, I'll happily spend it in that area. \"We can't do both Ciss\u00e9 and Duff if I'm honest, or at least we'd have to sell first. We've had some offers but I would like to keep the nucleus of my team. We've got some special players here and it would be silly to sell them because they've had a bad season. But there will be some difficult decisions ahead and I know I'll have to take them.\" Houllier would only listen to offers for Heskey - the club's \u00a311m record signing but who has mustered a paltry six league goals this season - if he felt he could secure both Ciss\u00e9 and Duff. The club's chief executive Rick Parry has already intimated that around \u00a315m will be made available despite the failure to qualify for the Champions League and last summer's heavy outlay. The manager has been quick to defend his purchase of El Hadji Diouf, Salif Diao and Bruno Cheyrou - like Ciss\u00e9, all plucked from French football - and sees the trio's future at Anfield despite their toils during a first season in the Premiership. However, the pursuit of the Auxerre pair and Duff, together with Fulham's Steve Finnan for \u00a33.5m, represents a marked switch in Houllier's transfer policy. \"We don't need potential anymore,\" he added. \"We need talent that can go straight into the first team.\" Liverpool's mini-transformation will also be aided by a quartet of players - Bernard Diom\u00e8de, Patrik Berger, Veggard Heggem and Abel Xavier - leaving on free transfers and freeing up more money from the wage bill. Liverpool retain an interest in Fulham's Steed Malbranque and West Ham's Joe Cole should their pursuit of Duff in particular be thwarted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
