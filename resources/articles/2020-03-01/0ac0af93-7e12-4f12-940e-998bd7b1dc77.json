For all the latest coronavirus updates please check our new blog. We\u2019ll be pausing the live blog for now. A woman in her 70s was confirmed as the first coronavirus death in the UK on Thursday as Downing Street warned that it was now highly likely that the virus would spread in \u201ca significant way\u201d. Seven new cases of coronavirus detected in Ireland include the first confirmed case of community transmission, since the patient had not travelled to an infected area. The number of confirmed covid-19 cases in Australia has climbed past 50, and include a baby diagnosed in South Australia and a tourist in the Northern Territory. There are 142 Britons stranded on another Princes Cruises ship, off the west coast of the US, and the passengers are being tested for the coronavirus. It has emerged that California\u2019s first fatality from the illness allegedly disembarked from the Grand Princess in Mexico last month. Britons returning from anywhere in Italy advised to self-isolate if unwell. Previously, the advice applied only to travellers who had visited the northern regions where the first deaths from the coronavirus were recorded. The European parliament has cancelled its planned session in Strasbourg next week after being told that that the health risks to MEPs and staff would be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d if it took place as planned And here\u2019s our glanceable summary of developments today: A coronavirus test developed by a US diagnostics company will be available for healthcare providers to order later today. The US government is ramping up efforts to increase its ability to identify the coronavirus and an ongoing struggle to expand local testing has led to criticism. Health officials said earlier today they expect to deliver enough coronavirus tests to public laboratories this week to test about 400,000 people. Officials expect to ship additional test kits to cover up to 1.7m people by the end of next week, US health and human services secretary Alex Azar said. The news of Laboratory Corp of America Holdings (LabCorp) tests comes as Quest Diagnostics and OPKO Health also said they would be able to begin testing for the virus from next week. The FDA has said it will allow some laboratories to immediately use the tests they have developed and validated while they await emergency-use authorisation from the US health regulator. Co-Diagnostics Inc said it was seeing a surge in demand for its coronavirus test kits following the FDA policy change. Previously, only testing kits developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, many of which were found to be faulty, could be used in public health labs, Reuters reported. Analysts at Evercore ISI expect the lab tests developed by Quest and LabCorp to be priced around $45 to $50, similar to a flu test. Religious groups have issued guidance for worshippers on practices including hand-shaking, sharing hymn books and taking communion wine as the spread of coronavirus intensifies across the UK, PA Media report. Varying levels of precaution have been taken by different faiths in a bid to protect congregations from catching the illness. Quakers have been urged not to shake hands as they would normally at the end of their meetings, while Catholics in some dioceses are being advised not to offer their hands for the sign of peace. Paul Parker, recording clerk for Quakers in Britain, said: Like many organisations that hold regular meetings, we have given advice on taking sensible precautions without raising anxiety. Quakers usually shake hands at the end of their meetings for worship, as an expression of unity. But the act of shaking hands itself is not a core part of Quaker faith and there are many other ways Quakers can share this greeting. We have advised meetings that they shouldn\u2019t shake hands in the current situation. A spokesman for the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of England and Wales said dioceses across the country would soon be moving into \u201cstage two\u201d of precautionary measures. This would include suspending the physical sign of peace \u2013 a handshake \u2013 removal of holy water stoups and shared hymn books, as well as advising elderly parishioners to stay at home. Catering at large parish gatherings where multiple people touch mugs and utensils would also be suspended, as would the passing round of collection plates during mass. The spokesman added that the decision might be taken by bishops in \u201cremote parts of England\u201d to not advance precautions in their dioceses. \u201cNo one size fits all and we are between stages, but my sense is that we are probably fast moving towards stage two,\u201d he said. Guidance issued by the Church of England asked \u201canyone with cold or flu symptoms to refrain from taking communion [wine] from the chalice\u201d, but said there was currently no need for the practice to stop. It added that no pastoral visits should be undertaken to people who are self-isolating but that \u201cphone support\u201d should still be provided. A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said that much of the NHS advice and an emphasis on cleanliness and hygiene was \u201cin line with Islamic tradition\u201d. In a statement, the MCB said \u201cmosques, madrassas and Muslim community centres should already be following best hygiene practices\u201d. The seven new cases of coronavirus detected in Ireland include the first confirmed case of community transmission, since the patient had not travelled to an infected area. The case of community transmission is a man in Cork with an underlying medical condition. He had not travelled to Italy or been in contact with other confirmed cases. He is being treated at Cork University Hospital, which announced it was cancelling outpatient appointments on Friday. Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the country remains in the containment phase, but warned it is a \u201crapidly evolving situation\u201d and urged a \u201cnational effort\u201d to stymie potential spread. Ireland remains in containment phase with just one case of community transmission. Public health doctors are working hard to ensure our containment measures are operating effectively. Most people who become infected with covid-19 experience a mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for some. However, this will need a national effort. Every individual needs to be aware of how to protect their own health and the health of others. The Health Service Executive said in a statement on Thursday night it was working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients may have had to prevent further spread. One of the cases confirmed on Wednesday \u2013 a member of a family of four in the west of Ireland \u2013 is a health professional, it has emerged. Four of the latest cases are travel related from northern Italy, involving four males from the east of the country. Two are associated with close contact with a confirmed case and involve two females in the west of the country. The seventh case is a male, who the Department of Health have described as being \u201cassociated with Cork University Hospital\u201d and that is the first case of community transmission. A risk assessment is under way at the hospital. There are now 13 confirmed covid-19 cases in the Republic of Ireland, as well as three in Northern Ireland - bringing the total number of cases on the island to 16. There are 142 Britons stranded on another Princes Cruises ship, off the coast of California, and the passengers are being tested for the coronavirus. The cruise operator said groups of guests and crew were being tested after a passenger on an earlier voyage died and at least one other became infected. It confirmed that 142 UK nationals - made up of 121 passengers and 21 crew - were on board the Grand Princess, which was carrying a total of 3,533 people. There had so far been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board, and that fewer than 100 people had been identified for testing, according to the operator. \u201cPublic health officials have advised that no guests will be permitted to disembark until all results have been received,\u201d it said. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, all guests who have been identified for testing have been asked to remain in their staterooms.\u201d Japanese authorities said last week that a British tourist who had been on board another of the company\u2019s cruise ships, the Diamond Princess - which was quarantined in Japan - had died after contracting coronavirus. Meanwhile, it has emerged that three passengers on the Grand Princess\u2019 previous voyage have been confirmed to have the new virus, and one of them reportedly became California\u2019s first fatality from the illness yesterday, after it disembarked hundreds at four Mexican ports last month. US health officials are working to track down other passengers who have returned home, but when Mexican health officials have not yet been notified by their counterparts, the Associated Press reported. Liverpool council has tweeted that two more cases of coronavirus have now been confirmed in Liverpool, bringing the total to three. \u201cOne is a known contact of an existing patient and the other has recently returned from Italy,\u201d it said. \u201cThe patients are receiving specialist treatment.\u201d Seven new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland today, bringing the total number of cases to 13, according to Irish media. A further three cases have been confirmed in Northern Ireland. People who have returned to the UK from any part of Italy in the past fortnight are being advised to self-isolate if they begin to feel unwell. Previously, the advice applied only to travellers who had visited the northern regions where the first deaths from the coronavirus were recorded, but the government has now announced that the guidance is being extended to cover the whole country. Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, said the move was needed because of the evolving situation in Italy. He told a press conference earlier this evening: The situation in Italy means that we have decided it is prudent at this point to move from a geographical area of north Italy... to a geographical situation for all of Italy. The pattern of what people do is exactly the same as before. It\u2019s about people from those areas, except for the cities which the Italian government specifies in lockdown, all other areas, only people who have got symptoms need to self-isolate. The number of confirmed covid-19 cases in Australia has climbed past 50, and include a baby diagnosed in South Australia and a tourist in the Northern Territory. In New South Wales, Epping Boys high school in Sydney\u2019s north will be closed on Friday after a student tested positive, and 61 staff at Sydney\u2019s Ryde Hospital have been placed in self-isolation after 56 patients were identified as close or casual contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 case. At Liverpool hospital, 23 staff and five patients have been identified as potential close contacts of a confirmed case. Elsewhere, in Brisbane and Sydney, nursing home staff have been forced into isolation after coming into contact with the virus. The federal government announced new travel control measures affecting South Korea, and New South Wales authorities have said they were trying to contact 70 doctors who attended a radiology conference with a man diagnosed with the virus. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, has warned the worst-case scenario for Australia was \u201cmillions of people being infected over a period of several weeks\u201d. However, he said the country\u2019s public health systems were well prepared if widespread outbreaks occurred. Two major sponsors of Crufts, believed to be the world\u2019s biggest dog show, have told staff not to attend the event \u2013 which began today. Pet food firms Royal Canin UK and James Wellbeloved asked employees to avoid the four-day event \u201cunless it is business critical\u201d, according to the BBC. Crufts, which takes place at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, has 20,000 competitors and their pets coming from all over the world. Last year, 27,000 dogs attended the event, with 21,000 competing, including 3,611 from overseas, 413 of which were from Italy. A spokesman from Mars Petcare, the parent company of Royal Canin UK and James Wellbeloved, said: As a global business, we have a responsibility to protect the health and well-being of our associates, as well as to do our part to prevent the spread of covid-19. As such, we\u2019ve decided to restrict international travel and not participate in large events until March 31. The Association of Pet Dog Trainers said: Following an emergency committee discussion regarding ongoing concerns about the APDT\u2019s attendance at Crufts, we have made the difficult decision not to attend this year given the unprecedented and unpredictable situation. The safety of our members remains our priority, and we hope that all our members, student members and attendees will understand. Crufts\u2019 organisers The Kennel Club said the event in Birmingham would still go ahead, with \u201cenhanced measures\u201d to protect visitors. Precautions would include hand sanitiser stations at entrances, toilets and catering areas, as well as additional signage. In a statement on its website, the club said Defra had not advised them to cancel the event. The European parliament has cancelled its planned session in Strasbourg next week after being told that that the health risks to MEPs and staff would be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d if it took place as planned The parliament\u2019s president, David Sassoli, did not mention the coronavirus outbreak. He said: On the basis of this evaluation, due to force majeure, I decided that the necessary security conditions are not in place for the usual transfer of the European parliament to Strasbourg for the plenary session next week. I have informed the French authorities and have thanked them for their collaboration in the past days. The plenary session will exceptionally be held in Brussels. Parliament undertakes to reschedule a plenary session in Strasbourg in accordance with the treaties. Here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has tweeted his condolences to the family of the first person to die in the UK with coronavirus. Has the coronavirus mutated into a more deadly strain? Here\u2019s a myth buster by Hannah Devlin, the Guardian science correspondent, which also examines the protective value of face masks and whether it\u2019s easy to catch the virus. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has indicated that the huge effort to limit the spread and impact of Covid-19 will soon move from trying to contain it, the first of the four phases of the response, to seeking to delay its transmission and thus limit the number of people who contract it. \u201cWe are moving from a primarily contain model to a primarily delay model,\u201d he said. However, many of the tactics remain the same in both phases, such as identifying carriers and tracing people they have been in contact with, he continued. \u201cThat pushes the disease further from the winter pressure period, further out from the period when people have upper respiratory tract infections, and it buys us time to better understand the virus and start the research into vaccines and things like that,\u201d Whitty said. Ministers will decide when the campaign to tackle the virus moves officially from \u201ccontain\u201d to \u201cdelay\u201d, Whitty added. The latter phase is deemed appropriate when health officials and ministers decide the virus is circulating so widely in the community that containment is no longer the right response. The delay phase could involve some of the measures set out in the government\u2019s coronavirus action plan on Tuesday, such as shutting schools, encouraging much greater homeworking and banning large gatherings such as sports and music events. However, Whitty told MPs on Thursday morning that closing schools may only have \u201ca marginal effect\u201d on the spread of Covid-19, because children are not badly affected by it. No details have been given about the unnamed woman who has died but it is understood that she was in her 70s and had recently spent time in and out of the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading for long-term health conditions. She died early on Thursday morning. Starbucks branches in the UK will be \u201cpausing the use of personal cups\u201d as a precaution against the spread of coronavirus, PA media reports. The company announced it would \u201ccontinue to honour existing discounts\u201d for anyone who brought reusable tumblers but that its drinks would be served in paper cups. It added that the 5p charge for disposable cups will be temporarily suspended. Of the 115 confirmed cases across the UK so far, it remains unknown how 10 of them came to be infected, including seven of the 25 who were diagnosed in the last 24 hours. However, tracing the contacts of people whose illness is initially a mystery should reduce that number, officials said. Global health experts have said the first death in the UK from the coronavirus is not unexpected and fits in with the pattern seen elsewhere. Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: \u201cThis unfortunate death is not unexpected given the number of cases and given we know that older people with underlying health conditions are most at risk. It changes nothing about the spread of Covid-19 in the UK.\u201d Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: \u201cThe first UK death is sad to note, but fits in with the pattern we have seen elsewhere, namely that the patient was older in age with existing health difficulties. \u201cWe can expect to see a small number of further deaths in the UK in the coming weeks, as case numbers increase and vulnerable populations become exposed. Infection control and public health measures are particularly important in institutional populations, such as the elderly in care homes.\u201d In a major change of policy, some people who are confirmed to have contracted the virus, but display only mild symptoms are now being treated at home rather than in hospital. Of the 115 confirmed cases across the UK since the outbreak began in late January, 18 have recovered, 52 are still being cared for in hospital and 45 are being treated at home, said Dr Susan Hopkins, the deputy director of Public Health England\u2019s national infection service. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved to a situation where people have minimal symptoms and they can self-isolate. It\u2019s safer for them to self-isolate in their own homes, with support,\u201d said Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England and the government\u2019s chief medical adviser for the UK. Prof Steve Powis, NHS England\u2019s national medical director, said: \u201cIf the symptoms are mild then it\u2019s appropriate for people to be in a home setting rather than a hospital setting.\u201d Asked how the authorities are ensuring that infected patients are staying indoors, she said that all 45 people are displaying very responsible behaviour. \u201cMany are isolating in their bedroom and only coming out of their room to get food and go back in. They are being very responsible.\u201d Public Health England has said travellers returning from all parts of Italy, not just north, are now being advised to self-isolate if they have symptoms. The change in advice is understood to have been prompted by the recent surge in cases of people who recently come back from Italy, where the outbreak has escalated across the country in recent days. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in New York state has doubled to 22, governor Andrew Cuomo confirmed today. Cuomo said: \u201cWe are trying to contain as much as possible the spread of each case we find \u2013 but we expect more cases.\u201d As of Thursday, there are 3,296 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy, 590 more than on Wednesday, according to the country\u2019s head of civil protection, Angelo Borrelli, adding that 148 people had died. There are 1,777 people infected in Lombardy, 658 in Emilia Romagna, 380 in Veneto, 106 in Piedmont, and 120 in Marche. The virus has now spread to all the 20 regions, including Val d\u2019Aosta. The Italian government has announced it is making \u20ac7.5bn available to help families and companies, as parents struggle to cope with the nationwide closure of all schools until 15 March. Rome is set to ask the European commission to allow \u20ac6.3bn deviation from its budget deficit target, the equivalent of about 0.35% of Italy\u2019s GDP. The cabinet also asked the justice minister, Alfonso Bonafede, to postpone trialsowing to the outbreak, Ansa had reported. Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, has confirmed the death of an older patient who had contracted the virus in the UK. The patient, who was in and out of hospital for non-coronavirus reasons, is the first person to die from the outbreak in the UK. Whitty said: I am very sorry to report a patient in England who tested positive for Covid-19 has sadly died. I offer my sincere condolences to their family and friends and ask that their request for privacy is respected. The patient, who was being treated at the Royal Berkshire hospital, was an older patient who had underlying health conditions. We believe they contracted the virus in the UK and contact tracing is already underway. The Royal Berkshire NHS Trust has confirmed an older patient is the first to die from the coronavirus in the UK. The trust said in a statement: Sadly, we can confirm that an older patient with underlying health conditions has died. The patient has previously been in and out of hospital for non-coronavirus reasons, but on this occasion was admitted and last night tested positive for coronavirus. The family has been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time. We will not be commenting further and ask that everybody respects the family\u2019s privacy.\u201d The rise of the staycation is a perennial story. In the past five years, heatwaves, Brexit, the weak pound, overseas terrorist attacks and, more recently, the climate crisis have all boosted UK holiday bookings. This year, coronavirus looks likely to do the same as British travellers swap holidays abroad for a break closer to home. Figures released on 4 March by the International Air Transport Association (Iata) showed that January had the lowest monthly increase in global airline passengers since 2010, when the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud led to massive airspace closures and flight cancellations. Demand for flights increased by just 2.4% compared with January 2019, where year-on-year growth had been 4.6%. \u201cJanuary was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the traffic impacts we are seeing owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, given that major travel restrictions in China did not begin until 23 January. Nevertheless, it was still enough to cause our slowest traffic growth in nearly a decade,\u201d said Iata\u2019s chief executive, Alexandre de Juniac. Global travel companies are already feeling the negative impact of coronavirus: Booking Holdings (which owns booking.com, priceline.com, kayak.com, cheapflights and momondo.com, among others), is predicting a 15% decline in total bookings in 2020. But UK tourism businesses are reporting a rise of up to 40% in traffic to their websites. \u201cFor the period 1 January to 24 February 2020, we are, on average, 40% up on web visitors compared with the same period in the previous year,\u201d said Steve Jarvis, owner of Independent Cottages. \u201cInitial analysis of the most recent enquiries is that they appear to all be domestic \u2013 overseas enquiries have reduced significantly.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesperson has warned that the coronavirus was likely to spread significantly. The British prime minister was updated on the coronavirus by the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser as he opened an official Cobra meeting. The PM\u2019s official spokesman said: We will continue to try to contain this virus. However, it\u2019s now highly likely that the virus is going to spread in a significant way. Officials will therefore accelerate work on preparations for the delay phase of the government\u2019s plan focusing on steps we can take to seek to delay the spread of the virus. This will include detailed work on the optimum time to introduce further measures. The Italian government has announced it is making \u20ac7.5bn available to help families and companies, as parents struggle to cope with the decision to close all schools nationwide until 15 March. Italy has been grappling to contain Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of coronavirus, which so far has claimed 107 lives. On Thursday, Rome revealed that is evaluating the possibility of providing support to families, including reimbursements for babysitter costs and unpaid leaves of absence from work. \u201cWe should not assume that people are home using up holiday pay or paid leave,\u201d Elena Bonetti, minister of family affairs, told Radio Capital. The Department of Health has released a breakdown of where the coronavirus cases are in England. A healthcare professional in the west of Ireland is among the latest group of people to test positive for the coronavirus, the Irish Time reports. The person worked a shift in a hospital emergency department in Clare after returning from northern Italy. The healthcare professional was one of four people from the same family who tested positive for the disease on Wednesday evening. The chief medical officers from the different regions within the UK have responded to the latest figures on the coronavirus outbreak. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said: As of 9:00am this morning 25 further patients in England have tested positive for Covid-19. Seventeen were diagnosed who had recently travelled from recognised countries or from recognised clusters which were under investigation. Eight patients were identified in the UK where it is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad. This is being investigated and contact tracing has begun. The total number of confirmed cases in England is now 105. Following previously reported confirmed cases in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, the total number of UK cases is 115. Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales, confirmed that a second patient in Wales has tested positive for coronavirus. He said: I can confirm that a second patient in Wales has tested positive for coronavirus. All appropriate measures to provide care for the individual and to reduce the risk of transmission to others are being taken. I can also confirm that like the first case in Wales, this patient had travelled back to Wales from northern Italy, where the virus was contracted. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to assure the public that Wales and the whole of the UK is well prepared for these types of incidents. Working with our partners in Wales and the UK, we have implemented our planned response, with robust infection control measures in place to protect the health of the public. The Scottish government has not raised the country\u2019s coronavirus alert status from contain to delay, unlike health chiefs in England and Wales, because the number and type of Covid-19 cases are not yet significant enough. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said on Thursday morning the number of confirmed cases in Scotland had doubled overnight to six after three people came into contact with the three previous Covid-19 patients. By 2pm on Thursday, there had been 1,250 negative tests according to the first bulletin in a series which ministers in Edinburgh said will be published at 2pm every day. Scottish government officials said there was not yet evidence in Scotland of community transmission involving patients not in direct contact with known carriers or a sufficiently high infection rate to raise the alert from its lowest status, containment, up a step to delay. The delay phase is focused on slowing the virus\u2019s spread through the wider community, and could involve banning or delaying large scale public events, to buy time for medical supplies to be built up and reduce the risks of the coronavirus coinciding with the peak occurrence of routine winter illnesses. Officials said they expected that to change a matter of hours or days. \u201cWe\u2019re under no illusion that it\u2019s only a matter of a short period of time before we move it to \u2018delay\u2019,\u201d said a government spokeswoman. The Department of Health confirmed that as of 9am on 5 March 2020, 18,083 people have been tested in the UK, of whom the tests came back negative for 17,968. Police in Northern Ireland may face 12-hour shifts and cancelled rest days if coronavirus has a serious impact on staffing levels, PA media reports. The chief constable of Police Service of Northern Ireland, Simon Byrne, said the potential impact of Covid-19 was very much unknown at this stage, but added that there were contingency plans in place if high numbers of his officers were struck down by the disease. \u201cAt the moment we are not complacent, and we can use a lot of experience from operating at pace at different times, whether it is dealing with complex investigations or serious disorder to keep officers and staff available to work,\u201d he said. There are currently three cases in Northern Ireland. \u201cThe disease, whilst the dots on the map are increasing, hasn\u2019t yet exploded into the country,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cWe are following the advice about personal hygiene, clearly what I need to do with senior colleagues is make sure our preparedness is at its optimum, so we are looking at a range of scenario planning in terms of how we protect officers and staff.\u201d The Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities until 15 March as it tries to tackle Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of coronavirus. More than 3,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus in Italy, of whom 107 have died Teachers and lecturers have turned to online classes to continue providing lessons to their students. The Associated Press has this photo of a teacher at the Polytechnic University of Milan, the largest Italian technical university with 45,000 students, giving online lessons. Birmingham city council has confirmed its first case of the coronavirus The Department of Health will shortly be providing its daily update on the total number of UK cases. Donald Trump has said that, as a result of a hunch, he didn\u2019t believe the World Health Organization\u2019s assessment of the global death rate from coronavirus of 3.4%. \u201cI think the 3.4% is really a false number,\u201d he told Sean Hannity, one of his favourite conservative Fox News hosts, in a phone interview broadcast live. \u201cNow, this is just my hunch,\u201d Trump began, before continuing: \u201cBased on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it\u2019s very mild \u2013 they\u2019ll get better very rapidly, they don\u2019t even see a doctor, they don\u2019t even call a doctor.\u201d He continued: \u201cYou never hear about those people, so you can\u2019t put them down in the category of the overall population, in terms of this corona flu, and/or virus. So you just can\u2019t do that.\u201d In London, there was some concern earlier that two patients at King\u2019s College hospital in London may have contracted it while in the hospital. However, the Guardian understands that both people were exposed to the virus before they reached the hospital. One of them is now being cared for in an isolation unit in St Thomas\u2019 hospital in central London where a number of other infected people are being cared for. Staff at a British government department have received an unfortunately worded email offering help with planning their \u201cdemise\u201d, the Daily Mirror reports. The message was sent to staff at the Department for Business, Energy, Innovation and Skills (BEIS). The Mirror reports that the email was sent by a representative of ISS, an outsourcing company, and reads that it is monitoring the situation in relation to the coronavirus. \u201cShould, as part of your preparations need us to consider something more specific to your demise, ISS are happy to do so,\u201d the email adds. In England, the University of Sussex has told students that it has been informed by health authorities that a person associated with the university has tested positive for the virus, following travel overseas. The university added: \u201cHowever, as this person has not visited Brighton or our campus since travelling, Public Health England (PHE) has confirmed there is no need for any special measures and that campus activities should continue as normal. \u201cThere are no confirmed cases of coronavirus on the University of Sussex campus.\u201d Over the next few weeks, the Guardian will be be releasing extra episodes of Science Weekly exploring questions people may have about coronavirus and would like to put to experts on the frontline. In today\u2019s episode, Ian Sample investigates where the virus infects us when it enters our bodies, and what difference this makes to disease severity and transmissibility. Italy\u2019s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, has accused CNN of \u201cdistorting reality\u2019\u2019 after it published a map of worldwide cases of the coronavirus linked to the country. According to the Italian authorities, the map, featuring a big red arrows sprouting from Italy to other parts of the world, does not highlight other areas struggling with the emergency such as China, Iran, South Korea and Japan. \u201cCNN has shown a map in which it looks as though Italy is the origin of the coronavirus outbreak,\u201d Di Maio posted on Facebook. \u201cThis is a distorted vision of reality. CNN is not the issue though, as this is just an example because other international media organisations are portraying Italy the wrong way too. The disinformation of some organs does not clash with opinions but with facts. \u201cItaly is the nation that is addressing with most rigour this emergency which, as we know, developed in China\u201d. Confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the Netherlands have more than doubled to 82, according to Dutch health authorities. There\u2019s more now on that report earlier about a confirmed coronavirus case among employees at HSBC offices in London. The company has evacuated a floor of its Canary Wharf office after an employee was confirmed to have been infected. The bank has sent 100 people home and ordered a deep clean of the 10th floor, which houses its research department. This has so far not affected HSBC\u2019s trading floor, which carries out large transactions on financial markets for big institutions. The evacuation was first reported by Financial News. South Africa\u2019s health minister has said that the country\u2019s health system would be \u201ctested\u201d by the coronavirus, after it earlier confirmed its first case. Zweli Mkhize said South African citizens quarantined in China would be returning home in the next few days. Addressing lawmakers in Cape Town, he added that South Africa was working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other institutions to help diagnose Coiv-19 across Africa. \u201cI think we need to be upfront about it ... Our system will be tested by the impact of coronavirus,\u201d Mkhize said. Iran will begin putting up checkpoints to limit travel between major cities and has urged people to reduce their use of banknotes as authorities try to restrict the spread of the coronavirus, which has caused at least 107 deaths and infected more than 3,500 people across the country. The Iranian health minister, Saeed Namaki, announced the drastic new measures during a televised press conference on Thursday, adding that schools and universities would remain closed until Nowruz, the Persian new year, on 20 March. Namaki told people to stay in their vehicles at petrol stations and allow attendants to fill their tanks to avoid the spread of the virus. Iran and Italy have the world\u2019s highest death tolls outside China, where the outbreak began at the end of last year. So far, there has been 95,000 confirmed cases worldwide and more than 3,200 deaths. There is more here in this wrap up about the situation in different countries. Europe is experiencing delays in supplies of medicines and face masks because of coronavirus disruptions, according to EU and industry officials, compounding already acute shortages of drugs on the continent. The European Union is assessing the delays in drug shipments from Asia, a senior official from the EU commission told Reuters, as France warned it was overdependent on China with about 40% of the country\u2019s drug ingredients imported from there. The European concerns come as India, which is the world\u2019s main supplier of generic medicines and also relies on Chinese ingredients, decided to restrict some drug exports. \u201cMany active pharmaceutical ingredients are produced in China and the virus outbreak is affecting the manufacturing capacity and stability of the supply of these ingredients,\u201d the European Medicines Agency told Reuters. The total number of the new coronavirus cases in Greece has risen to 31, after 21 more people who came in contact with the country\u2019s ninth confirmed case tested positive, ekathimerini.com reports. The figures were revealed in a press briefing from Greek health ministry spokesman Dimitris Tsiodras. The country is moving into \u201cphase 2\u201d of the ministry\u2019s health risk containment strategy, meaning that official measures will focus on containing the virus from spreading from western Greece. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog again. Egypt has declared its first coronavirus infection of an Egyptian national. The country\u2019s Ministry of Health and Population said the 44-year-old display symptoms after returning from Serbia via 12-hour transit in France. The man has now been quarantined, as Egyptian officials say they have stepped up efforts to limited then spread of the virus, including screenings at airports. Egypt previously declared two foreign nationals had Covid-19. A Chinese national who tested positive in mid-February later recovered, while a 54-year old Canadian national was quarantined last Monday. As recently as last weekend, the Egyptian prime minister and health ministry repeatedly said that Egypt was free of the virus, despite raising suspicions after multiple foreign nationals dreturned from trips to Egypt displaying symptoms. \u201cOne trip to Egypt was the source of 11 cases out of 20 people,\u201d in the French town of La Balme-de-Sillingy according to Le Monde. The Egyptian health minister, Hala Zayed, travelled to China this week to discuss the outbreak. She told a press conference that Egypt had tested 1,443 people for the virus, with only one testing positive. The UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority has warned businesses not to take advantage of people by exploiting the coronavirus outbreak. The CMA said it would take enforcement action against companies that charged excessive prices or made misleading claims about the efficacy of protective equipment. The CMA chairman, Lord Tyrie, said: \u201cWe will do whatever we can to act against ripoffs and misleading claims, using any or all of our tools; and where we can\u2019t act, we\u2019ll advise government on further steps they could take, if necessary.\u201d Its chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: \u201cWe urge retailers to behave responsibly throughout the coronavirus outbreak and not to make misleading claims or charge vastly inflated prices. We also remind members of the public that these obligations may apply to them too if they resell goods, for example on online marketplaces.\u201d Here\u2019s the latest summary of today\u2019s events. South Africa has confirmed its first case of coronavirus. The person is a man, 38, who travelled to Italy with his wife in a group of 10 people who arrived back in South Africa on 1 March. At least 349 people are infected in Germany, the German government has confirmed, a rise of 109 cases within 24 hours. On Monday there were just 38 confirmed cases. All mosques and churches have been closed in Bethlehem. The Palestinian health ministry declared a medical state of emergency in the West Bank city after a suspected case of coronavirus at a hotel. No cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the Palestinian territories. Iran has reported 3,515 coronavirus cases and 107 deaths. The figures from the country\u2019s health ministry come as the Iranian authorities impose checkpoints to limit travel between major cities. Iran is now one of the centres of the outbreak. Starbucks has said it will only use disposable cups at its North American outlets. The company also said it was \u201cpausing the use of personal cups and \u2018for here\u2019 ware\u201d in its stores. A 33-year-old German man may be the first European to have contracted Covid-19 and to have transmitted it. According to the German doctors, the \u201cotherwise healthy\u201d businessman, known as patient 1, became ill with a sore throat, chills and myalgias (muscle pain) on 24 January. The following day, he developed a fever of 39.1C (102.4F) and a wet cough. However, he started feeling better during the evening of the next day and went back to work on 27 January. In the UK people who are elderly or have pre-existing conditions could be advised to stay away from crowds as the outbreak progresses. The remarks came from the government\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, during evidence to MPs. The federation of German industries, has warned the coronavirus is likely to send Europe\u2019s biggest economy into recession. The BDI said economic growth was likely to \u201cfall prey\u201d to the virus. \u201cEconomic growth threatens to come to a halt,\u201d it said in its first quarterly report for 2020. England\u2019s Six Nations game against Italy on 14 March in Rome has been postponed. Confirmed cases of coronavirus in Scotland have increased from three to six. Catherine Calderwood, the country\u2019s chief medical officer, said the new cases were in the Forth Valley, Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde and Grampian NHS areas, and were all linked to the three previous cases. The death toll in the US has climbed to 11. California reported its first fatality and declared a state of emergency. The person who died was an elderly man with underlying health issues. Greece has reported its 10th case. The latest person to be confirmed as having the virus is related to an individual who recently travelled to Israel and Egypt, health authorities have said. India\u2019s health ministry has issued a statement that there were 29 positive cases in the country by 4 March. Citizens have been advised not to travel to any country that is affected by the virus. Hello, It\u2019s Aamna taking over the blog from Ben so he can have lunch. The British government will release geographic information on coronavirus cases on a daily basis. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: : \u201cI think the prime minister and the chief medical officer have both said this morning we will provide geographic information on cases - it will be at 2pm, it will be with a 24-hour delay to make sure that all of the details are correct.\u201d The spokesperson confirmed the UK would not be asking for an extension to the Brexit transition period because of the outbreak. The spokesman said: \u201cThat work has been continuing throughout and I expect it to carry on as planned - no change.\u201d The first confirmed case of the coronavirus has been identified in South Africa. The person is a man, 38, who travelled to Italy with his wife in a group of 10 people who arrived back in South Africa on 1 March. The man attended a GP surgery two days later with symptoms including fever, headache, a sore throat and a cough. A team that will attempt to trace contacts has been sent to Kwazulu-Natal with epidemiologists and doctors. A school in the city of Osnabr\u00fcck in north-west Germany has sent a convoy of buses and ambulances to pick up a group of 55 pupils and teachers from a skiing holiday in South Tyrol, German media has reported. Two doctors and other medical staff, as well as parents, are part of the group sent to bring the children back, two of whom have suspected coronavirus symptoms. A child with a fever has already been picked up by her father and is being tested. The children are to be separated into two groups: suspected cases with medical staff will travel in one bus, with those considered healthy in the other. The convoy is expected back in Osnabr\u00fcck on Friday. Are you someone who has had the coronavirus and has recovered?

French plans to move at some point from \u2018stage 2\u2019 of its response to the coronavirus to \u2018stage 3\u2019 are to be discussed today at a meeting of advisors convened by France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron. Le Monde has details of the discussions in anticipation of stage 3, when the outbreak spreads to the entire country and schools and other institutions may close. David and Sally Abel, a British couple who contracted coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, are resigned to being kept in quarantine in a Japanese hospital for at least two more weeks. In a video update from the hospital room, David said both he and his wife still have coronavirus, more than two weeks after first being diagnosed on the ship as it was docked off Yokohama. Sally was tested negative last week, but has since tested positive again. David said he \u201ccurled up into a ball\u201d and felt close to death after the virus led to pneumonia but both he and Sally were now recovering and gaining \u201cmore energy\u201d every day. Asked by YouTube viewers when he would return to the UK, he said: \u201cUntil we get a run of negative tests that isn\u2019t even open for negotiation. We have to be given a certificate to say we are absolutely clear of the virus. My gut feeling is probably two to three weeks.\u201d David suspects his room is being monitored by CCTV camera, but he said his Japanese carers had been \u201cso gracious\u201d. And he added that the couple accepted they were being closely monitored \u201cfor our own good\u201d. An employee in HSBC\u2019s research department in London has tested positive for coronavirus, three sources have told Reuters. The employee informed the bank at the weekend and staff who came into contact with him have been told to work from home, a source familiar with the matter said. Deep cleaning is taking place of affected areas, the source added. A spokesman for the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, says the government will not need to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit transition period due to the coronavirus. DeepMind, Google\u2019s London-based AI research unit, has published predictions of the structure of proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes the disease Covid-19], in the hope that they help scientists understand how the new coronavirus functions, and allow for more precise investigation into potential treatments. The company used its AlphaFold system, which applies machine learning techniques to estimate the physical structure of proteins, to generate the predictions, which it has published without the normal, time consuming, review or verification process for such work. \u201cKnowing a protein\u2019s structure provides an important resource for understanding how it functions, but experiments to determine the structure can take months or longer, and some prove to be intractable,\u201d the researchers wrote in a post accompanying the publication. \u201cFor this reason, researchers have been developing computational methods to predict protein structure from the amino acid sequence.\u201d A \u201clong-term commercial niche\u201d for vaccines to counter the new coronavirus will be opened up, according to the head of a global NGO which acts as an umbrella for drugs researchers. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer plausible that containment will be a success and the new coronavirus disease knocked out,\u201d says Richard Hatchett, chief executive of CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations), in a Financial Times piece on the race to find a vaccine. It adds though that, for now, any commercial gain from involvement in creating a successful vaccine is a secondary concern to the drive to find a treatment. Full Fact, the UK fact-checking charity, has released some pieces of work countering misleading claims about the outbreak. They include: Claim: Scientists believe that coronavirus may have come from bats in a Chinese research facility. Full Fact conclusion: Two Chinese scientists have published an article suggesting that the 2019 coronavirus outbreak could have originated from bats in a laboratory in Wuhan. However, apart from maps showing the proximity of laboratories, they offer no evidence to prove this. Claim: Scientists knew about the new coronavirus long ago and called it \u201cDisease X\u201d. Full Fact conclusion: They didn\u2019t. This is a misunderstanding about the phrase \u201cDisease X\u201d, which the World Health Organization used to denote an unknown serious new disease that might cause a pandemic. The German government\u2019s main body for safeguarding public health has announced this morning that 349 people are officially infected with the coronavirus in Germany, a rise of 109 cases within 24 hours. On Monday the figure from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) was just 38. The real figure will be still higher \u201cbecause of the fluidity of the situation\u201d, a spokesman said, with the RKI never able to be fully on top of the new numbers as health authorities continue to report new incidents through the day. Meanwhile the government has given pharmacies permission to mix their own disinfectant solutions with industrial alcohol, in an attempt to keep up with the unprecedented demand. Following a suspected case of coronavirus at a hotel in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, the Palestinian Ministry of Health has closed all mosques and churches in the area. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian Authority news service, a medical state of emergency had been declared in the holy city, home to the Church of Nativity, a popular pilgrimage site revered as the birthplace of Jesus. While no cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the Palestinian territories, authorities also cancelled all sports events in the city and shut schools. It had also asked tourists to cancel hotel reservations, the Wafa report said. Some 3,513 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Iran, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. There have been 107 deaths, said officials. Multiple sporting events have been postponed, moved or cancelled, with others now cast into doubt. They include: Euro 2020 The Europe-wide, travel-heavy Uefa showpiece is due to take place at 12 venues, starting in Rome on 12 June. The semi-finals and final will be at Wembley. Uefa say the situation is \u201cunder constant scrutiny \u2026 we are monitoring it country by country, and football will follow orders of the individual countries\u201d. England\u2019s warm-up against Italy is scheduled for Wembley on 27 March. The FA is following developments. Premier League and domestic football Widespread disruption already, with multiple Serie A games called off and concerns over completing the Italian domestic season. The Swiss league, Japan\u2019s J-League, South Korea\u2019s K-League and China\u2019s Super League are all on hold, with pre-season International Champions Cup fixtures set for Asia also called off. Olympics and Paralympics Tokyo 2020 officials are sounding defiant but options are being discussed. The events start on 24 July and 25 August respectively; IOC member Dick Pound says a final decision could be made as late as the end of May, with cancellation, rather than postponement or relocation, the most likely outcome. The athletics world indoor championships, scheduled to take place in China next month, are already off. Iranian authorities are to begin manning checkpoints to limit travel between major cities due to the coronavirus in a country which is now one of the centres of the outbreak. The country has also moved to close schools and universities until the end of the Iranian calendar year on 20 March because of coronavirus. Health minister Saeed Namaki made the announcement Thursday at a televised news conference. Starbucks has said it will only use disposable cups at its North American outlets. The company also said in a statement that it was \u201cpausing the use of personal cups and \u2018for here\u2019 ware\u201d in its stores. Translation: there won\u2019t be any more drinks in washable mugs or customer-owned cups. Other measures include its move as a corporate body to restrict all business-related air travel. \u201cAlthough the situation remains fluid, our US and international markets have gleaned learnings from our leadership team and partners in China who were first faced with this epidemic,\u201d the company said. Dubai has asked sports events organisers to postpone all sports related activities until the end of the month, according to a government circular seen by Reuters. The circular, issued by Dubai Sports Council, said the request was a precautionary measure to ensure public health. A 33-year-old German man may be the first European to have contracted Covid-19 and to have transmitted it, Italian daily newspaper il Corriere della Sera has reported, citing a letter of German experts published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. According to the German doctors, \u201ca 33-year-old otherwise healthy German businessman (Patient 1) became ill with a sore throat, chills, and myalgias on 24 January 2020. The following day, a fever of 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F) developed, along with a productive cough. By the evening of the next day, he started feeling better and went back to work on 27 January.\u201d On 20 and 21 January, before the onset of symptoms, the man had attended a series of meetings with a Chinese business partner at his company near Munich. The business partner, a Shanghai resident, had visited Germany between 19 and 22 January. \u201cDuring her stay, she had been well with no signs or symptoms of infection but had become ill on her flight back to China, where she tested positive for 2019-nCoV on 26 January,\u201d write the doctors. The woman had immediately informed the company about her illness. Contact tracing was started and the 33-year-old German man was sent to the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine in Munich for further assessment. On 28 January, three additional employees at the company tested positive for 2019-nCoV and so far, none of the four confirmed patients show signs of severe clinical illness. \u201cThis case of 2019-nCoV infection was diagnosed in Germany and transmitted outside Asia,\u201d write the experts. \u201cHowever, it is notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of the index patient, in whom the illness was brief and nonspecific.\u201d People who are elderly or have pre-existing conditions could be advised to stay away from crowds as the outbreak progresses, the chief medical officer Chris Whitty has told MPs. He added that parliament was no more risky than any other environment, following reports the Palace of Westminster could be closed down as a result of the outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is encouraging countries who want to know how much of their population is sick with the virus to start testing people with symptoms. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme technical lead, made the comments in a briefing earlier. The Federation of German industries, the BDI, has warned this morning that the effects of the coronavirus on businesses is likely to send Europe\u2019s biggest economy into recession. Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute said that by Wednesday afternoon there were 262 confirmed cases in Germany, with all but one of the country\u2019s 16 states affected. The BDI said economic growth was likely to \u201cfall prey\u201d to the coronavirus. \u201cEconomic growth threatens to come to a halt,\u201d the federation said in its first quarter report for 2020. It added that if the coronavirus was not brought under control in countries affected by it, by the second economic quarter it expected a much bigger impact. Germany\u2019s economic growth had already been slower than expected before the virus hit, due largely to the slowdown in China. While we reported earlier that North Korea\u2019s leader has sent a letter to the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, offering his condolences for South Korean victims of the coronavirus, observers have expressed fears that the north could be suppressing information about infections. Given that countries with advanced health services are struggling to contain the outbreak, a significant number of infections in North Korea would place intolerable strain on its weak medical infrastructure. \u201cUnfortunately, the international community has no idea if the coronavirus is spreading inside North Korea,\u201d said a recent report by Jessica Lee, an East Asia expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a thinktank in Washington. \u201cThe fact that we know nothing about the level of infection or deaths within North Korea is extremely problematic and, left unchanged, could have serious public health implications.\u201d While continuing to declare itself virus-free, North Korea has banned foreign tourists, placed people who have traveled abroad in quarantine and closed its 900-mile border with China - a move that overseas monitors with contacts inside the country say has caused shortages of food, cooking oil and gasoline. As the number of cases south of the border dividing the Korean peninsula continues to grow, pressure is mounting on the North to allow international experts to assess the situation there. The UN special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, Tomas Ojea Quintana, has urged North Korea to \u201callow full and unimpeded access to medical experts and humanitarian actors, and relax restrictions on access to information. Further isolation of the country is not the answer\u201d. In addition, the US state department has said it would \u201csupport and encourage\u201d international efforts to help North Korea fight the disease, despite stringent sanctions imposed on the country over its nuclear weapons programme. A 74-year-old woman in western Switzerland has died after contracting the coronavirus, the country\u2019s first death from the rapidly spreading disease, Reuters reports. The woman had been hospitalised at Lausanne\u2019s University hospital in the canton of Vaud since Tuesday, police said. She was a high-risk patient suffering from chronic disease, authorities added. England\u2019s Six Nations game against Italy on 14 March in Rome has been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Press Associatino news agency has reported. Tournament organisers faced the option of playing the game behind closed doors at the Stadio Olimpico or delaying it until later in the year and have chosen the latter option. Official confirmation of the decision is expected from Six Nations later today. The UK response to coronavirus was already moving into its second \u201cdelay\u201d phase, rather than seeking to simply \u201ccontain\u201d the disease, Prof Whitty told British MPs. \u201cWe have moved from a situation where we are mainly in contain, with some delay built in, to we are now mainly delay,\u201d said Britain\u2019s chief medical officer, although elements of the contain process would remain in place. British health authorities \u201cmay have had a communications fumble\u201d when they announced on Wednesday that they would not be providing daily updates on new coronavirus cases, the UK government\u2019s chief medical officer has told MPs. They are intending in the medium term to provide more detailed updates with what Chris Whitty described as \u201ca proper dashboard\u201d but they would be having a delay of 24 hours to make sure details were correct. Three more cases of Covid-19 have been detected in Scotland among people who have had contact with the previous patients, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to six. Catherine Calderwood, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, said the new cases were found in the Forth Valley, Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde and Grampian NHS areas, and were all linked to the three previous cases. \u201cWith all these cases, our thoughts are with those diagnosed and their families. Scotland is well equipped to deal with this kind of infection and we are doing everything we can to contain the virus at this stage and minimise the risk to the public,\u201d she said. \u201cClinicians are now conducting contact tracing, the process of gathering details of the places those who have tested positive visited and the people they have been in contact with.\u201d Calderwood has echoed warnings from elsewhere in the UK that there is likely to be a significant surge in coronavirus cases, peaking in two to three months time. Following Scotland\u2019s first case at the weekend, two further cases were announced yesterday, after more than 850 negative tests for the virus. She said earlier this week that in a worst-case scenario between 50% and 80% of the population could be infected during the course of the epidemic, with 4% of those needing hospitalisation. There are now several cases in the UK where healthcare officials cannot see where coronavirus infection has come from clearly, whether it is from having been abroad or having been in contact with someone who has, Whitty adds. \u201cThat makes it highly likely that there is some level of community transmission in the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we should work on the assumption that it is here at very low levels and we should work on that assumption going forward.\u201d Although the total number of coronavirus cases in the world are still dominated by China, its numbers are coming down quickly, British MPs have been told by Professor Chris Whitty, the UK\u2019s chief medical adviser. He adds, however, that it won\u2019t be known if there will be a rebound until restrictions are lifted. Whitty is appearing along with Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, in front of parliament\u2019s health committee. Chances of containing the outbreak globally are \u201cslim to zero\u201d, he said. British hospitals may currently not have enough respiratory resources to deal with absolutely everyone who would need to be treated in hospital, according to a senior executive. The health service was coping well at the moment, said Neil Dixon, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, whose members provide services to the National Health Service. \u201cOf course there may come a point where the level of infection becomes so great that the NHS and doctors and so on will have to make quite difficult choices about who to treat and when to treat them. \u201cIf you take something like intensive care, people make those choices at the moment. The answer is that there will be more of those kinds of choices going forward. Things like intensive care, we have got 4,000 beds, but we will be able to flex that, there will be more, and it\u2019s mostly about giving respiratory support to people. \u201cWe can put in many more beds like that, which are sort of intensive care beds, to treat larger and larger numbers of people, but there may come a point where you say: \u2018well I am not going to move somebody because, a, the movement itself might be more difficult, we may not have enough respiratory stuff to deal with absolutely everybody, but none of us know.\u201d It was, Dixon added, about getting a balance right in terms of reassuring people, and Britain \u201cprobably\u201d had one of the best health systems in the world. The British government has hinted it may reverse a controversial decision to withhold information about the geographical spread of the coronavirus. Heath minister Edward Argar acknowledged public concerns about the news that the government would not be releasing information about the location of new cases until a weekly round-up each Friday. Speaking to BBC Breakfast he admitted the government was \u201clearning every day\u201d and was looking at a \u201ctech solution\u201d to allow it to keep the public informed about the spread of disease. On Wednesday, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer said the government would stop providing daily updates on the location of patients who had tested positive \u201cdue to the number cases\u201d. The decision prompted accusations of secrecy and concerns that it would led to the spread of fake news. Argar said: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely right, that we give out as much information as we can.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is whether we can find a tech solution that will enable us to do that to keep people informed [which] is hugely important. But to do it in an efficient way that it\u2019s easy to administer and easy to get the information out.\u201d His remarks suggest the government is considering the example of South Korea where phone alerts are available to signify when users come within 100 metres of a confirmed case, based on government data. Argar said: \u201cMy boss, the health secretary, is clear that we will report on geographical spread and geographical locations, but there\u2019s a little bit of a lag time because of that big increase.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue with that geographical information because I think in anything of this sort, and it\u2019s a new disease, we\u2019re learning every day, how it works. Understandably, people will have concerns and questions. It\u2019s important that we share as much information as we can with the public to reassure and to keep people informed. So I think there is a positive from this in terms of public engagement.\u201d Fresh figures are expected in an hour on the state of the virus in Iran, which has reported 92 deaths among its more than 2,900 cases. In the meantime, the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Wintour tweets this graphic of how the Iranian ministry of health think the virus has spread across the country: Some 322 new coronavirus cases have been reported in South Korea, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), an official body. South Korea has been carrying out a mass testing initiative of tens of thousands of people since the end of January. Earlier, the total number of cases stood at 5,766, with 35 deaths. The US death toll from coronavirus has climbed to 11 as California reported its first fatality and declared a state of emergency over the virus. The death in California was of an elderly man with underlying health issues, who tested positive for the virus on Tuesday and was probably exposed while traveling on a Princess cruise ship that departed from San Francisco to Mexico in February, public health officials said. It was the first death from the outbreak in the US outside of Washington state. The man lived in Placer county, an area north-east of Sacramento, near Tahoe national forest, and was kept in isolation at Kaiser Permanente Roseville. It was the second confirmed case of coronavirus in the county. California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency over the virus on Wednesday. In a statement, Newsom said he extended \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to those affected by the death in Placer county and that \u201cCalifornia is working around the clock to keep our communities safe, healthy and informed\u201d. As concern about coronavirus leads to Australian shoppers emptying shelves of toilet paper, one newspaper has decided to....er... do its bit to help alleviate shortages North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said he hopes that neighbouring South Korea will overcome a coronavirus outbreak, President Moon Jae-in\u2019s office said on Thursday. In a letter to Moon delivered on Wednesday, Kim also voiced concern over Moon\u2019s health, and discussed his view of the situation on the Korean peninsula, Yoon Do-han, Moon\u2019s senior press secretary, told a briefing. South Korea is battling the biggest epidemic outside China and reported 438 new infections on Thursday for a total of 5,766. North Korea has meanwhile quarantined hundreds of foreigners in an attempt to stop the virus from breaking out, although other states have expressed concerns about that secrecy and the authoritarian nature of the country mean that it\u2019s unclear how the situation is developing there. Greece has reported its 10th case of coronavirus, a person related to an individual who recently travelled to Israel and Egypt, health authorities have said. On Wednesday the government ordered the closure of schools and banned public gatherings in three districts in the west of the country as a precaution after a person from the region tested positive for coronavirus, authorities said. That person had recently returned from a religious pilgrimage to Israel and Egypt. The ban was in effect for 48 hours and subject to review, authorities said. The cases come as Greek authorities react to a developing crisis as thousands of people arrive at the country\u2019s border with Turkey. About 12,500 people are estimated to be waiting on the Turkish side of the Greek border after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said on Saturday he would open his country\u2019s borders for refugees fleeing the nine-year war in Syria to cross into Europe. In India, where citizens have been advised not to travel to any country that is affected by the virus, the health ministry has issued a statement recording that there were 29 positive cases in the country by 4 March. It makes a range of other points including flagging up concerns around Indian pilgrims and students stranded in Tehran and Quam, Iran, which it describes as \u201cepicentres of the Iran Covid-19 outbreak\u201d. Funerals of coronavirus victims in Britain could be transmitted to mourners over the internet to prevent the spread of the disease if it becomes a pandemic, the Daily Telegraph reports. The paper says bereaved relatives who have come into close contact with victims would be at greater risk of contracting the illness themselves, resulting in the government seeking to discourage them from holding large funerals. It also cites official government pandemic planning documents which raise the prospect of crematoria being open 24 hours a day, and all week, to cope with up to 50,000 extra deaths per week in the worst case scenario. Chinese President Xi Jinping has postponed his state visit to Japan in April due to the coronavirus outbreak, Japan\u2019s government said Thursday. Xi was to have been the first Chinese president to visit Japan since Hu Jintao in May 2008. Xi was scheduled to meet Japan\u2019s emperor, Naruhito, attend a banquet at the imperial palace and hold talks with Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. The leaders had hoped the visit would underline recent improvements in bilateral ties after years of tension over rival territorial claims to the Senkakus, a group of islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan but claimed by China, where they are known as the Diaoyu. Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said the two countries had agreed that their immediate focus should be on containing the coronavirus outbreak. Coronavirus continues to dominate the morning newspapers across Europe, including in the UK, where news of the collapse of Flybe, Europe\u2019s largest regional airline made it into later editions. The Guardian leads with our story on the UK government being accused of withholding information about the spread of coronavirus after a 70% increase in confirmed cases prompted health officials to stop providing daily updates on the location of new infections. In other titles, the Times leads with concerns that Britain\u2019s parliament could be suspended for months to prevents MPs spreading the virus. Others, including the Telegraph, and the Daily Mail lead on yesterday\u2019s news about the trebling of new cases of coronavirus, while the announcement that the new James Bond will will be postponed makes the front page of others such as the Mirror. Facebook has confirmed that a contractor at a Seattle office has been diagnosed with the coronavirus and the social media giant said it would close that location until March 9. \u201cA contractor based in our Stadium East office has been diagnosed with the COVID-19,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Facebook said it has notified employees, adding that workers in all Seattle locations were being encouraged to work from home until the end of the month. Seattle in Washington state has the largest concentration of coronavirus cases confirmed to date in the United States.

You can flag up news tips by emailing me at ben.quinn@theguardian.com or tweet me at @BenQuinn75 The Vietnamese government has released an educational coronavirus pop song \u2013 and it\u2019s a hit. In Australia, the ABC\u2019s Angelique Lu tweeted that the song had gone \u201cminor viral\u201din several countries. New infections, panic buying and schools closing continued worldwide, but Japan says the Olympics will go ahead in July. The death toll in mainland China passed 3,000, with a further 31 deaths on Wednesday taking the total toll to 3,012. All of the deaths were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. Confirmed cases in China rose by 139 to reach 80,409, and reversing two days of decreasing counts. South Korea\u2019s number of confirmed cases neared 6,000 on Thursday. So far 36 countries and regions have imposed a blanket entry ban on people who have recently been in the country\u2019s South, according to the foreign ministry in Seoul. California\u2019s governor has declared a state of emergency after the announcement of the first virus-related death there. The state now has 53 confirmed cases. Italy closed all schools and universities until 15 March and ordered that all major sporting events be played behind closed doors. The virus has killed 107 people there, and spread to all but one of Italy\u2019s 20 regions. Japan\u2019s Olympics minister said the Games would go ahead in July as planned, saying that cancelling \u201cwould be unacceptable for the athletes\u201d. The country has 1,036 cases and 12 people have died, its health ministry has said. Australia introduced a travel ban for South Korea and brought in enhanced screening for those arriving from Italy. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has said the government is \u201clooking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks\u201d. Germany\u2019s health minister has labelled the outbreak a pandemic, something the World Health Organization has so far stopped short of declaring. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that we have not yet reached the peak of the outbreak,\u201d Spahn told German politicians. Panic buying continued around the world. Masks and toilet paper, in particular, remain in demand. And here\u2019s today\u2019s Coronavirus Latest \u2013 At a Glance, by Graham Russell: Italy\u2019s government is likely to increase the value of measures to help the economy withstand the coronavirus outbreak to to 5 billion euros (US$5.57 billion). Deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said on Thursday. \u201cIt is likely that the government will reach (5 billion euros)\u201c Castelli said in an interview with daily Il Messaggero, adding that she thought it was \u201cnecessary to raise the bar as much as possible\u201d. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has promised tax breaks and other measures for the affected sectors worth 3.6 billion euros. A government source told Reuters on Wednesday this may be raised to 4.5 billion, or 0.25% of GDP. Apple Inc and Netflix Inc say they are pulling out of the South by Southwest music and tech festival to be held later this month, amid the coronavirus outbreak. The U.S. death toll from coronavirus infections rose to 11 on Wednesday and California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency amid the nation\u2019s largest outbreak. Facebook Inc had said earlier this week it would not participate in the festival. Organisers of the South by Southwest music and tech festival, set to be held in Austin, Texas, had said last month the event would proceed as planned despite \u201ca handful\u201d of cancellations related to the virus. Shelves are being stripped bare of toilet rolls, hand sanitiser and surgical masks everywhere from Japan to France to the United States as panic buying criss-crosses the globe with the coronavirus, defying repeated calls for calm and disrupting supply chains, the AFP reports. Australia\u2019s biggest supermarket this week began rationing sales of toilet paper after police had to be called to a shop in Sydney when a knife was drawn in a scuffle over the scarce commodity. On Saturday Japan\u2019s prime minister took to Twitter to calm fears of a national shortage, while social media photos from the US show toilet paper shelves lying bare. Last month ten thousand people queued outside a Hong Kong shop that had secured a shipment of single-use surgical masks, and days later masks were voted the most desireable gifts to receive for Valentine\u2019s Day. In London, masks are now going for more than 100 times their normal retail price, while French authorities said they will requisition all face mask stocks and production. This is despite the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying it did not \u201crecommend the use of facemasks\u201d to help combat the outbreak. Thailand has reported four new coronavirus cases. The latest cases bring the total to 47 since January, Suwanchai Wattanayingcharoen, director-general of the Department of Disease Control said in a news conference on Thursday. Correction: We reported earlier that the new Thai coronavirus cases involved people who had travelled from Iran, Italy and China. This was an error \u2013 they had travelled from Iran and Italy, with one case being a Chinese student who tested positive after being screened at Bangkok airport on his way from Iran to China, Reuters reports. A Turkish Airlines aircraft was flown back to Istanbul without any passengers on Thursday on orders from authorities in Singapore after a passenger who had arrived on the same plane on Tuesday tested positive for coronavirus. Singapore\u2019s aviation regulator said that the three pilots and 11 other crew of flight TK54 that had arrived on Tuesday were on the return flight to Istanbul, where they would be placed in quarantine. \u201cThe crew had come into close contact with a passenger on flight TK54 who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19,\u201d the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in contact with the Turkish Embassy, which has confirmed that the crew will be quarantined upon arrival at Istanbul,\u201d CAAS said. Singapore\u2019s transport ministry said in a statement on its website that authorities had begun tracing passengers on flight TK54 that may have had contact with the infected person. Here\u2019s a wrap on the latest coronavirus news from Helen Davidson and Justin McCurry. China\u2019s death toll passed 3,000, as Germany\u2019s health minister labelled the outbreak a pandemic and modelling in Australia predicted a worst-case scenario where millions could be infected with Covid-19. The developments came as the coronavirus continues to spread around the world. South Korea\u2019s number of confirmed cases neared 6,000 on Thursday and Italy ordered the closure of all schools after the virus spread to all but one of its 20 regions, killing 107 people. The UK has been warned an epidemic is likely. A further 31 virus deaths in China took the number of fatalities beyond 3,000 on Wednesday. All of the deaths were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, and authorities confirmed 139 new cases \u2013 a rise on the previous day\u2019s total. In the US, California declared a state of emergency over its 53 confirmed cases, and a cruise ship linked to the state\u2019s first virus death was being held off the coast of San Francisco. The Australian state of Western Australia has recorded its third case of coronavirus. The woman in her 30s returned to the state this week after travelling to Iceland and London and flying home via Dubai. State health minister Roger Cook, said the state had not yet recorded any cases of apparent on-soil transmission. \u201cWestern Australia remains coronavirus free in terms of internally contracted or transmitted cases,\u201d Cook told reporters in Perth on Thursday. \u201cAll the cases which have occurred in Western Australia have been those that have contracted the disease outside the state, so our ongoing campaign to constrain and isolate in relation to the coronavirus epidemic is still being highly successful.\u201d Dr Andy Robertson, Western Australia deputy chief health officer, said authorities were tracing the woman\u2019s movements. Robertson said she was not symptomatic on the plane and self-isolated when she became sick. The woman remains in home isolation. The other two cases in the state were a couple in their 70s who contracted the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and were transferred to Western Australia, where the 78-year-old man died. Cook said coronavirus clinics would be operational in the state from Tuesday and the state had spent $2.3m to purchase 50 new ventilators for hospitals. Just an update on what Australia\u2019s new travel restrictions involves. The government on Thursday banned the arrival of foreigners from South Korea It extended existing bans on foreigners arriving from mainland China and Iran and said there would be tougher screening processes for people arriving from Italy. New travel restrictions mean that any foreign traveller who has been in China, Iran and South Korea within two weeks of arriving in Australia will be turned away. The bans, which include anyone who has transited through those countries, will be reviewed on a weekly basis. Australian nationals and residents are exempt from the bans, but are required to self-isolate for two weeks on their return to Australia. Travellers from Italy will be given temperature checks and required to completed a detailed health questionnaire before they are cleared for entry. Most of the staff at a Sydney aged care home at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak did not turn up to work on Wednesday night because they were concerned about endangering their own family members, the union representing aged care workers has said. BaptistCare, which runs the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Macquarie Park, refused to comment when asked if a number of staff had failed to turn up to their shift after news broke of a Covid-19 outbreak at the facility. But the Health Services Union secretary Gerard Hayes said the union had been told by staff at the facility that \u201cmost\u201d of the workers rostered to work on Wednesday night had called in sick and the shift was covered by a work hire agency. Residents at the aged care centre have been confined to their rooms and employees have been told to stay home and self-isolate if they show any symptoms, as health authorities struggle to contain the virus. Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt has told the ABC that a \u201cremote Indigenous community in the [A\u1e49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara ] has chosen to self-quarantine to prevent anyone coming in with coronavirus,\u201d ABC journalist Anna Henderson has said on Twitter. Australian officials have not been able to visit a citizen locked up in China because of coronavirus, and there are concerns for another person jailed in Iran, AAP reports. The global outbreak of coronavirus has prevented Australian consular officials from visiting a citizen locked up in a Chinese prison. There are also concerns for another Australian detained in Iran, where the virus has spread among prisoners. Australian writer and pro-democracy advocate Yang Hengjun has been detained in China since January last year. Dr Yang is granted one half-hour consular visit each month. However, Foreign Affairs official Andrew Todd said his February visit was cancelled by Chinese authorities due to COVID-19 control measures in place. \u201cThese same measures apply across all prisons in China,\u201d he told a Senate estimates hearing on Thursday. \u201cWe are seeking through our embassy in Beijing with Chinese authorities alternative ways of making contact with Dr Yang, either through a telephone call or through written correspondence.\u201d South Australian senator Rex Patrick asked whether the coronavirus posed any risk to Dr Yang. \u201cNot that we\u2019re aware of at this stage,\u201d Mr Todd said. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that we\u2019re monitoring very closely with all Australian citizens detained across the world, but particularly in countries where there are current outbreaks of COVID-19.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s extra edition of the Science Weekly podcast looks at where exactly in the body Covid-19 infects us. Over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll be releasing extra episodes of the podcast exploring some of those questions with experts on the frontline. In today\u2019s episode, Ian Sample investigates where the virus infects us when it enters our bodies, and what difference this makes to disease severity and transmissibility. The death toll in mainland China has passed 3,000, with a further 31 deaths on Wednesday taking the total toll to 3,012. Confirmed cases there rose by 139 to reach 80,409. California\u2019s governor has declared a state of emergency after the announcement of the first virus-related death there. The state now has 53 confirmed cases. The victim, a 71-year-old man, travelled on the Grand Princess cruise ship last month, and the vessel is now being held off the coast of San Francisco while tests are conducted. Twenty one people on board have reported flu-like symptoms. Italy has closed all schools and universities until 15 March and ordered that all major sporting events, including Serie A football, would be played behind closed doors. The virus has killed 107 people there, and spread to all but one of Italy\u2019s 20 regions Japan\u2019s Olympics minister has said cancelling or delaying the Games in July \u201cwould be unacceptable for the athletes\u201d. The country has 1,036 cases and 12 people have died, it\u2019s health ministry has said. Australia introduced a travel ban for South Korea and brought in enhanced screening for those arriving from Italy. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has said the government is \u201clooking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks\u201d. The health minister for New South Wales has said containment of the virus is now \u201cunlikely\u201d. Germany\u2019s health minister has labelled the outbreak a pandemic, something the World Health Organization has so far stopped short of declaring. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that we have not yet reached the peak of the outbreak,\u201d Spahn told German politicians. The UK has seen the biggest daily increase to date, with cases jumping by more than 60% to 87 cases. India is restricting the export of several drugs, including paracetamol and antibiotics, leading to fears of a global shortage of essential medicines. The IMF has torn up its growth forecasts. The fund has warned this year\u2019s growth will be lower than last year\u2019s. Concerts, conferences and sporting events are being cancelled in countries around the world. MGM Universal has also announced the postponement of the release of the new James Bond film, No Time to Die. The Australian government has published guidelines for Australians who need to self-isolate either because they have been diagnosed with the virus, or because they\u2019ve been deemed at risk of acquiring it. As well as advising people to stay at home or in their hotel, including not going to public places, in particular work, school, childcare or university, the government has also issued advice on how to alleviate boredom while in isolation \u2013 including doing craft. \u201cKeep in touch with family members and friends via telephone, email or social media,\u201d the advice says. \u201cExercise regularly. Options could include exercise DVDs, dancing, floor exercises, yoga, walking around the backyard or using home exercise equipment, such as a stationary bicycle, if you have it. Exercise is a proven treatment for stress and depression. \u201cDon\u2019t rely too heavily on the television and technology. Treat quarantine as an opportunity to do some of those things you never usually have time for, such as board games, craft, drawing and reading.\u201d The selloff on world stock markets has been stemmed for now with decent gains across Asia Pacific on Thursday, but the issue of the virus is still front and centre in the minds of investors. Damien Klassen at Nucleus Wealth in Melbourne has been tracking the data and has posted some charts and thoughts on the firm\u2019s website. It\u2019s well worth a look, especially in light of what Australia\u2019s chief medical officer was saying earlier about the modelling scenarios about how it could infect millions in the worst case. Klassen makes the point that we should use data from South Korea, Singapore and the Diamond Princess to extrapolate how it might spread because figures from countries such as China , Italy and Iran come with question marks. For example, he questions how reliable Chinese data can be when South Korea now has more recorded cases than any Chinese province except Hubei. Also he looks at whether climate is a factor since there has been no significant outbreak so far in a tropical country. Japan\u2019s Olympics minister said the country is committed to hosting the summer games as planned from July even as the coronavirus outbreak spread to new parts of the country. \u201cCancellation or delay of the Games would be unacceptable for the athletes,\u201d Seiko Hashimoto said in parliament on Thursday. The minister had caused controversy earlier this week by saying the contract for the games \u201ccould be interpreted as allowing a postponement\u201d within calendar 2020. Confirmed coronavirus infections rose to 1,036 nationwide as of Thursday morning, 36 more than the previous day, according to national broadcaster NHK. It was the biggest one-day increase to date, with new cases in locations ranging from Kumamoto prefecture in the southwest to Hokkaido in the north. The Australian toilet paper-buying urge is strong even for two Australian behavioural scientists Liam Smith and Celine Klemm write, \u201cHumans are finely attuned to monitoring what everybody else is doing (even subconsciously). Most of us use \u2018what other people do\u2019 as a mental shortcut to decide on what the appropriate behaviour would be if we are unsure. It\u2019s a simple decision mechanism called \u2018social proof heuristic\u2019, a concept popularised by psychologist Robert Cialdini. For instance, we litter more when the surrounding environment is littered, because it signals to us that littering is the norm. Hotel guests are also more likely to reuse their towels if told that \u2018the majority of guests reuse their towels\u2019. So, when we see people stockpiling toilet paper, the natural reaction is to do the same. Social proof can help decide how to act, or reassure us that we are taking the right action.\u201d An Australian newspaper has printed extra pages for people to use as toilet paper. Coronavirus-fulled panic buying has led to shortages of loo roll across the country in recent days. It\u2019s the panic that keeps on giving. #ToiletPaperEmergency or the great #ToiletPaperApocalypse, as it has been dubbed on Twitter, has already rolled out hundreds of memes, witty asides as well as documented the madness of people stockpiling the toilet essential. In the real world it has led to Australian toilet paper manufacturers ramping up production to keep up with demand from people fearful of coronavirus. One newspaper has gone one step further by printing extra pages in its editions to help out those who have been \u2026 caught short. On Thursday the NT News, the Darwin-based newspaper with a national reputation for its headlines and antics, printed a special eight-page insert that can be cut into toilet paper. We have a bit more information about the latest cases from South Australia, from a press conference given at the Royal Adelaide hospital a short time ago. Two people, a baby and a 58-year-old man, tested positive to Covid-19 on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases in South Australia to seven. The public health physician, Dr Nicola Spurrier, said the baby girl was the daughter of a 40-year-old woman who was hospitalised in Adelaide\u2019s Flinders Medical Center on Wednesday after testing positive for the virus. The woman arrived in Adelaide from Iran via Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. \u201cThe little bub, the child of the mother that is currently in Flinders Medical Centre has tested positive but I am very pleased to report that the child is well and both mother and baby are doing well in that facility,\u201d Spurrier said. The 58-year-old man, from Taiwan, arrived in Adelaide on Tuesday and was taken to the Royal Adelaide hospital to be isolated on Thursday. Spurrier said authorities were also tracing any possible contacts that a 24-year-old South Australian woman, who returned from Europe on Sunday and had travelled through Italy, may have made since returning to Adelaide. That woman tested positive on Wednesday. \u201cThere are a number of places that that young woman visited before she had the test results and we are all following through on those potential places,\u201d Spurrier said. Italian tourists have been caught trying to evade virus containment in Mauritania A group of Italian tourists tried to escape coronavirus confinement in Mauritania but were caught and sent back to their home country, the West African country said Wednesday. The 15 tourists arrived in the capital Nouakchott on Saturday planning to travel to the northern tourist hub of Atar, health ministry spokesman Abdelkader Ould Ahmed told AFP. But Mauritania has imposed a confinement period on travellers from countries considered to be a high coronavirus risk \u2013 including Italy, which has Europe\u2019s most cases with more than 3,000 as well as 107 deaths. Italy\u2019s foreign ministry confirmed that the tourists had since all returned home, \u201cassisted by our diplomatic network\u201d. The Mauritanian spokesman said the confinement rules applied to \u201call travellers from risk areas, without distinction\u201d. He added that this \u201crigour has paid off\u201d as the country has yet to register a case of coronavirus. Hong Kong has warned residents not to kiss pets after a dog contracted coronavirus Hong Kong authorities have warned people to avoid kissing their pets, but also to not panic and abandon them after a dog repeatedly tested \u201cweak positive\u201d for coronavirus. The Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said experts unanimously agreed the results suggested the dog had \u201ca low-level of infection and it is likely to be a case of human-to-animal transmission\u201d. The Pomeranian\u2019s owner was infected with Covid-19 but the dog itself was not showing symptoms, authorities said. Coronavirus has spread to almost all of Iran\u2019s provinces President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that while the virus has spread to almost all of Iran\u2019s 31 provinces, the country will get through the outbreak with a \u201cminimum\u201d number of deaths, Reuters reports. \u201cThis disease is a widespread disease,\u201d he said during a Cabinet meeting, according to the official presidency website. The health ministry said on Tuesday that 92 people had died so far from coronavirus, one of the highest death tolls outside China where the epidemic originated late last year. It said 2,922 people had been infected with the disease. Among those infected is first vice president Eshaq Jahangiri, the IranWire news site reported, citing an \u201cinformed source\u201d. There was no immediate confirmation from officials. Several Iranian officials have come down with coronavirus and one senior official died from an infection on Monday. The Islamic Republic has cancelled Friday prayers in all provincial capitals this week because of the coronavirus outbreak, state television reported on Wednesday. In the US, all NASA employees will be working from home on Friday, POLITICO reports. The measure is partly in order to \u201cstress test\u201d their remote work technologies in case an extended period of remote work. A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California is being held off the coast of San Francisco, with 21 people on board reporting possible symptoms. Seven in 10 people worldwide would support sealing off entire cities or towns affected by coronavirus to slow the spread of infection, according to a poll of citizens in 10 countries, Reuters reports. As health authorities battle to stop a worldwide pandemic, a clear majority backed lockdowns to prevent anyone entering or leaving urban areas that have seen large numbers of coronavirus cases, found the survey by polling firm Ipsos. \u201cEven in Italy, where this is already happening, 60% support the total quarantine of affected towns and cities,\u201d Darrell Bricker, head of Ipsos Public Affairs said. Europe\u2019s largest regional airline collapses, Coronavirus last straw Flybe, Europe\u2019s largest regional airline, has collapsed into administration less than two months after the government announced a rescue deal. The impact of the coronavirus on flight bookings proved the last straw for the Exeter-based airline, which operates almost 40% of UK domestic flights, as the government stalled on a controversial \u00a3100m loan. Stronger airlines are likely to follow. In Australia, the Guardian has confirmed that a baby has been diagnosed with Covid-19 in South Australia. The baby\u2019s mother was diagnosed yesterday, after returning to the country from Iran on Sunday. Both the mother and child diagnosed with Covid-19 in South Australia are at Flinders Medical Centre in Adelaide. Trump has attempted to blame Obama for coronavirus test kit shortage Donald Trump sought to shift blame on to the Obama administration for a nationwide coronavirus test kit shortage. The president on Wednesday blamed a federal agency decision during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, which Trump said made it harder to quickly roll out testing for the virus. \u201cThe Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we\u2019re doing, and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion,\u201d he told reporters during a White House meeting with airline executives, whom he had called to discuss the economic effects of the outbreak. \u201cThat was a decision we disagreed with,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would have made it, but for some reason, it was made.\u201d Virus is \u2018once in 100 years catastrophe\u2019 \u2013 hedge fund boss Ray Dalio, one of Wall Street\u2019s highest profile hedge fund bosses, has described the coronavirus as \u201cone of those once in 100 years catastrophic events\u201d that will hit companies with large debt levels the hardest and potentially lead to a significant economic downturn. The founder of Bridgewater Associates, a fund with $160bn in assets, said the crisis could be broken into three parts: 1) the virus, 2) the economic impact of reactions to the virus, and 3) the market action. The market website Livewire has posted excerpts from his comments on Linkedin. Dalio says that the US Fed\u2019s rate cuts \u2013 and similar actions by other central banks from Australia to Canada \u2013 won\u2019t do much to boost demand, although they might \u201cgoose risky asset prices a bit\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s true in the US. In Europe and Japan, monetary policy is virtually out of gas so it\u2019s difficult to imagine how pure monetary policy will work. In Europe, it will be interesting to see if fiscal policy stimulations can pick up in this political environment.\u201d Chinese social media censors blocked neutral information about the coronavirus outbreak when they targeted references to the outbreak on WeChat and other platforms, a report has found. Hundreds of keywords and keyword combinations, including \u201cWuhan seafood market\u201d and \u201cSars variation\u201d were censored in late December, as doctors sought to warn about the new virus. Here is the full story on that press conference with Australia\u2019s New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard regarding the on-soil spread of coronavirus in the state. In China, a 36-year-old man who had been confirmed to have the virus and was discharged from a hospital in Wuhan on 26 February has died, according to the Chinese publication the Paper, who cited his wife. The man suddenly became ill on 2 March and died after going to the hospital. The cause of death was respiratory failure caused by Covid-19. China has been noting daily increases in the number of people \u201ccured\u201d or discharged from hospitals after being confirmed to have the virus. But, after several cases of released patients testing positive again, authorities in Hubei ordered that released patients be quarantined for another 14 days. Beijing Ditan Hospital in Beijing has meanwhile found that a patient who tested positive for Covid-19 has suffered viral encephalitis caused by the virus, adding to evidence the infections can cause damage to patients\u2019 nervous systems. Hong Kong residents who had been stuck in Hubei province, the source of the outbreak, have returned on flights chartered by the Hong Kong government. There were 244 passengers. Another 200 are expected to be brought back today. Anyone showing symptoms or a high temperature has not been allowed to board, and all will undergo quarantine for two weeks, the Hong Kong government said. Among the group are 14 pregnant women and 22 people in need of medical care, including cancer patients. South Korea\u2019s total number of novel coronavirus cases \u2013 the largest outside China \u2013 approached 6,000 on Thursday as authorities reported 145 new infections. The total stood at 5,766, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, with 35 deaths. So far 36 countries and regions have imposed a blanket entry ban on people who have recently been in the South, according to the foreign ministry in Seoul. Nearly 90 percent of the national total occurred in the southern city of Daegu and the neighbouring North Gyeongsang province. Australia\u2019s Scott Morrison says there is \u201cno suggestions that there should be no mass gatherings\u201d in the country, as he said the outbreak in Australia was significantly less challenging than those in other countries \u2013 in response to what the significance might be for Australia\u2019s economy. He urged any Australians experiencing symptoms to \u201cdo the right thing by their fellow Australians\u201d and \u201cprevent the spread of the virus\u201d. Still in Australia for now, the Guardian\u2019s Katharine Murphy has asked Scott Morrison to elaborate on the travel travel ban regarding South Korea. Part of the reason, Morrison responded, was the number of travellers arriving in Australia from South Korea. \u201cThe volume of travellers coming out of the Republic of Korea was more than five times what it is out of Italy,\u201d he said. It \u201cmay well be possible within a matter of days or weeks to be able to ensure that we can deal with that,\u201d he said, but for now the travel ban was \u201cthe way to go\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Sarah Martin has asked Morrison and chief medical officer Brendan Murphy about what they know about the likely spread of transmission in Australia. Murphy said the government is \u201clooking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks.\u201d Scott Morrison then jumped in to say the government had \u201cbeen careful not to be speculative about this in the public domain. What we have done all the way through this global health crisis, I think, is to be very candid and up front and we will continue to do that but what we won\u2019t do is be speculative, because we\u2019re not in the position of creating unnecessary anxiety.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy has addressed Australia\u2019s toilet paper hoarding behaviour as he urged the public to behave as they usually would. \u201cAt the moment, there is no reason to put a mask on when you are walking around the shops, there is no reason to stop going to football matches or community activities, there is no reason to dilute the shelves of lavatory paper in the supermarkets. We should continue a normal activity, we should watch the development of this and, we will focus on any outbreaks and control.\u201d Australia\u2019s federal chief medical officer Brendan Murphy has said the government is \u201cvery worried about Iran.\u201d Australia\u2019s National Security Committee is reviewing the progress of its preparations for a potential pandemic, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said. \u201cThat has gone from everything from availability of surgical masks and in particular, to working with the health sector,\u201d he said. He added that work was ongoing in particular with regard to Indigenous communities and aged care. \u201cWe have always gone about business with common sense and that is what we are known for so let\u2019s do that,\u201d he added. More on Australia\u2019s travel measures regarding South Korea from Prime Minister Scott Morrison: \u201cIn relation to the Republic of Korea, we will also be upgrading the travel advice to level three, which is to reconsider the need to travel to the Republic of Korea, and it will be at level four which is do not travel to the province of Daegu.\u201d Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is speaking now, and has announced that the current travel bans regarding mainland China and Iran will continue. A new travel ban has been put in place for the Republic of Korea, and enhanced screening measures are being introduced at airports for travellers arriving from Italy. Hong Kong authorities have confirmed the 105th case of Covid-19, in a 69-year-old Happy Valley woman who recently returned from India. The woman had an underlying illness, and fell sick in India on 23 February, the day before she returned home to Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific flight CX694 from New Delhi. Four days later she developed a fever and consulted a Chinese medical practitioner twice, before visiting an out-patient clinic on 3 March. After testing positive for Covid-19 the woman was admitted to Ruttonjee hospital on Wednesday, and is in a stable condition. The woman\u2019s husband and the domestic helper who lives with them are asymptomatic and will be quarantined, the government said. Passengers onboard the 24 February flight are urged to contact 2125 1122 if they are concerned. Authorities in New South Wales, Australia are assessing a group of children from a childcare centre who visited a Sydney aged care home last month, before four people at the centre were diagnosed with Covid-19. Four people at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care home in Macquarie Park, including a 95-year-old woman who has since died and an aged care worker, have been diagnosed with the virus. The centre has been placed into isolation. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard said young children were \u201coften super spreaders\u201d of respiratory illnesses and that he was recommending visits by childcare centres to aged care homes be discontinued. Meanwhile, authorities are also trying to contact 77 doctors and primary care officials who were at a radiology conference on 18 February that the 53-year-old doctor from Ryde Hospital, who tested positive to the virus, and another registrar from Liverpool hospital, who also has the virus, both attended. In New Zealand, the third person infected with coronavirus is a man 40s lives in Auckland. Close family members of his have recently returned from Iran. \u201cThis third case of COVID-19 is classified as what we suspect is a case of family transmission. There is what appears to be a clear link with travel to Iran by a close family member,\u201d the Ministry of Health said. The man is now at home in self-isolation as he doesn\u2019t require hospital care, nor does anyone else in the family home, who are self-isolating with him. A medical centre where the man sought advice has been notified, and two schools where the man\u2019s family members attended have sent children home for self-isolation. No other children are showing symptoms at this stage. In Australia, New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard has said there is an \u201cevolution\u201d happening in the spread of coronavirus around the world. While there had been \u201cno substantial change\u201d overnight in New South Wales, seven of the state\u2019s infections appeared to have been \u201con-soil,\u201d he said. There are currently 22 infections in the state. \u201cNew South Wales health is doing everything they can to try to still contain it, but we do know that containment is likely to be an unlikely outcome,\u201d he said. Japan\u2019s infections pass 1,000 Japan\u2019s confirmed coronavirus infections rose above 1,000 on Wednesday, most of them from a quarantined cruise liner, as Olympics organisers dismissed speculation that the Tokyo Summer Games could be cancelled. Twelve people have died in Japan, six from the cruise chip, the health ministry said. The president of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics said the option of cancelling the Games was not on the table, responding to deepening speculation of a delay or cancellation. \u201cI am totally not considering this,\u201d Yoshiro Mori told reporters at a briefing when asked about a possible cancellation. Asked when the organisers could decide on changes to the Olympics, Mori, a former prime minister, said: \u201cI\u2019m not God, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d Mainland China had 139 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Wednesday, the country\u2019s National Health Commission said on Thursday, up from 119 cases a day earlier, and 125 cases on March 2. That brings the total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 80,409. The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China had reached 3,012 as of the end of Wednesday, up by 31 from the previous day. The central province of Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, accounted for all of the new deaths. In the provincial capital of Wuhan, 23 people died. California governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus in the state, which now has has 53 confirmed cases. Earlier on Wednesday, health officials announced the first California death from the virus, an elderly person with underlying health conditions. It was the first coronavirus fatality in the United States outside of Washington state, where 10 have died. A M\u0101ori tribe in New Zealand\u2019s capital city has banned the traditional hongi at gatherings this week as more cases of coronavirus emerge. A hongi is a traditional form of greeting in which two people press their noses to each other and inhale one another\u2019s breath. In Wellington, local iwi (tribe) said a temporary ban would be placed on hongi between members at gatherings this week. On Wednesday night a third case was confirmed and the ministry of health asked for calm after sufferers and their families were criticised on social media. In Australia, health officials in the Northern Territory are yet to determine if any residents of small and remote Indigenous communities have been exposed to Covid-19 after the first diagnosis. A 52-year-old tourist tested positive to the disease and is now in isolation at Royal Darwin Hospital. The man flew to Darwin from Sydney on flight QF840 on Tuesday. NT Chief medical officer Dianne Stephens said it is unclear if any remote community-based Aboriginal people were on the plane, and it is impossible to determine how many people may have come into contact with the man. Stephens also said it was unclear how long it would take for a test undertaken in a remote community to reach the state\u2019s only available Covid-19 testing laboratory in Darwin, meaning diagnosis could be delayed if a case were to occur in remote NT. She said a Remote Health Pandemic Plan will be released by Monday. The government\u2019s current advice says that anyone who may have come into contact with the virus should seek accommodation within three hours of major municipalities in the state, and not visit or return to a remote community, even if they live there. Germany\u2019s health minister, Jens Spahn, said Wednesday the coronavirus outbreak has become a pandemic \u2013 defined as an epidemic that spreads throughout the world through local transmission, AFP reports. \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak in China has become a global pandemic,\u201d Jens Spahn told German lawmakers. The World Health Organization has so far stopped short of declaring a pandemic, though has said the world must prepare for the possibility. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that we have not yet reached the peak of the outbreak,\u201d Jens Spahn told German lawmakers. The virus has reached 81 countries and territories around the world, with South Korea, Iran and Italy emerging as hotspots outside China. Welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus. More than 100 people have now died in Italy.
