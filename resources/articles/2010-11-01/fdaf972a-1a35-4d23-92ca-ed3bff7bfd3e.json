Unless Smith feels he really has unfinished business in England's top flight \u2013 and a club from that division affords him an opportunity from next season \u2013 Wednesday night's Champions League tie at Ibrox will almost certainly be the final professional coming together of the Scottish managerial pair. Smith and Ferguson appear to have grown closer as their years have advanced, with the Rangers manager adamant his counterpart at Old Trafford is the best who has ever lived. \"I don't think there's any doubt about that,\" Smith says. \"To stay in the one place and continually build great teams is a remarkable achievement. Phenomenal. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has proved he's a fantastic manager, but there's a need within him to move [clubs]. \"It's the mental thing that drives Sir Alex. He's reached the stage of his life where he can't live without it, whether it's praise or aggravation. \"Coming back to Glasgow will have a wee effect on him because this is where he's from and this is the club he played for, but it doesn't matter where he goes because he wants to win every game.\" This latter desire was evident between Smith and Ferguson 24 years ago, when they were part of the Scotland coaching staff at the World Cup in Mexico, where they found a challenging way to pass the time. Their stories of what occurred differ, with Smith's thus: \"I beat him at Trivial Pursuit. We played throughout the whole World Cup in 1986. By his count we were quite close when we left Mexico and we agreed that, when we touched down in London, whoever was winning at that point was the winner. And it was me. \"He was then going to Aberdeen and I was going to Glasgow. Otherwise he would have made us play on. He has never mentioned it since. I won the game. Alex will try to tell you differently. He's probably erased it from his memory. \"He's still as competitive. The physical aspects of what you've got might start to go, but the mental aspect is as strong as ever.\" Smith cannot be counted among those who sense United have unnecessarily toiled during this domestic campaign. Rather, the Rangers manager feels Ferguson's men simply suffer from it not living up to their own exceptional standards. \"Manchester United sometimes are judged by their own high level and that doesn't necessarily mean they have dropped to any dramatic degree,\" the Rangers manager explains. \"If you look at some of their games this season, they have lost goals in the latter stages. They have drawn games they had been winning, so they are dropping two points. I think that might have happened to them four times this season. But they are still playing to a great level and it's a level we'll have to get up to.\" Rangers' hopes of an upset have been doused, in part, by the hamstring injury sustained by Madjid Bougherra. The Algerian might be vastly overrated in certain quarters, but can still claim to have snuffed out Wayne Rooney twice in the not so distant past; for his country during the World Cup and during the scoreless Champions League match in Manchester two months ago. Typically, Smith is unwilling to divert attention towards his own situation. Fine results in their closing two group games notwithstanding, Wednesday's game will mark the 62-year-old's last Champions League encounter at Ibrox. Unlike his old friend Ferguson, Smith has continually stated there will be no reversal of his decision to leave the club at which he has attained iconic status come the end of this season. \"There will be a whole load of things I'll miss, but, once you have made your decision, that's part and parcel of it,\" says Smith. \"The only thing I'm bothering about on Wednesday is that we do well. I hope we continue to do as well as we have in the previous home games. Everything else is irrelevant.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
