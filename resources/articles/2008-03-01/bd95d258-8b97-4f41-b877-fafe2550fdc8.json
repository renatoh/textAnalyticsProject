The pleas are included in a document sent to creditors, a bulletin on BBC Three Counties Radio reported yesterday. It is unclear how many of the 17 FA charges the club are planning to plead guilty to, but punishment is likely to be a minimum six-figure fine. The Keniworth Road club went into administration last year. Charges were first brought against Luton in November and relate to negotiations for nine players that took place between July 2004 and February 2007 and which saw payments totalling \u00a3160,000 made to six agents by the club's holding company, Jayten Stadium Limited, without first being disclosed to the FA on the required forms. The Hatters were also accused of providing misleading information to the FA and of dealing with unlicensed agents. The charges were denied in December, soon after Luton were docked 10 points for going into administration. They currently lie second bottom in League One. Their former chairman Bill Tomlins and former directors John Mitchell, Derek Peter and Richard Bagehot were also part of the investigation, which saw a total of 50 charges issued by Soho Square. Tomlins, who resigned in April last year, has admitted seven out of his 15 charges for breaking FA rules. Peter has denied nine charges, alleging that he approved payments made by Jayten in relation to the nine negotiations. Mitchell and Bagehot have denied failing to report the alleged rule breaches when they became aware of them and, like Tomlins and Peter, have requested personal hearings. The six agents - Sky Andrew, Mike Berry, Mark Curtis, Stephen Denos, David Manasseh and Andrew Mills - were charged with allegedly failing to ensure that payments were made and disclosed through the proper channels, and failing to enter into representation contracts with the club for specific services rendered in relation to the above negotiations. Denos, Manasseh and Berry admitted the charge relating to representation contracts and denied the other charge, with Denos requesting a personal hearing. The cases against Luton, who were unavailable for comment last night, their former officials and the six agents will all be heard by an FA regulatory commission."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
