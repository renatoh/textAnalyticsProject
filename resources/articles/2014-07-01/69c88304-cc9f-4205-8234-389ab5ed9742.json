Now comes the hard part. With Jos\u00e9 Mourinho showing no desire to keep the club\u2019s all-time leading scorer, the 36-year-old wanted another challenge. So when the chance arose to sign for New York City, the US branch of Sheikh Mansour\u2019s plans to establish Manchester City as a true global brand, there was little hesitation. Whether to follow Steven Gerrard\u2019s lead and retire from international football, though, is a far harder question to be answered. The dismal showing at the World Cup would have left most seasoned internationals, especially one with 103 caps, content to leave that world behind him once and for all. Yet Lampard insists he is uncertain as to where his England future lies. If he is to play a part in the push for Euro 2016 qualification he will need to find somewhere to play with NYC FC not starting until the next MLS season, which is due to begin in March 2015. A loan spell at City is highly unlikely, according to Etihad sources, as is spending time at Melbourne Heart, phase three of the club\u2019s global outreach programme. QPR\u2019s manager, Harry Redknapp, remains keen to take his nephew to Loftus Road although at this present time, England is at the forefront of his mind. \u201cIt was a bad tournament for us but I\u2019ll tell you what, I had a bit of a moment after the last game against Costa Rica,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cThe reception we got off the fans. Considering the way we\u2019d played. It made me very proud to experience that. \u201cI\u2019m going to make the decision very soon. I wanted to get this cleared up first. I\u2019ve enjoyed my time with England. I\u2019m too proud an Englishman to make a decision like this lightly. I have to be completely sure it\u2019s the right call for me. I\u2019m going to take a view on it now. It\u2019s one of the things I want to do quickly \u2013 talk with my family. I have to think about what playing for England means to me. I know I have to decide soon because obviously the games start coming round soon enough.\u201d Having seen Gerrard join Ashley Cole in international retirement, does that make it easier for Lampard to follow suit? \u201cI didn\u2019t need to see them retire to know that the end will come for me at some stage, of course it will,\u201d he added. \u201cYou get to a point when you just know. We need young players to come through. I\u2019m not silly. I know it can\u2019t go on for ever. People might have thought that the last game at the World Cup, when I was captain, that was going to be it. But then I was vice-captain \u2013 Stevie wasn\u2019t playing. If that turns out to be my last game I\u2019ll go out a very proud man.\u201d Quitting Chelsea after 13 years was tough to take but with Cesc F\u00e1bregas quickly brought in during the summer, the writing was already on the wall. Lampard admitted: \u201cI was aware before the World Cup that I was leaving Chelsea. I had a decision to make and I didn\u2019t want to make it during the World Cup \u2013 even though I was thinking about my future. \u201cThere were other options, yes. Some in England, other parts of the world, but this was the one that always stood out to me. The idea of coming to this city and playing for a new team with a really good vision for the future \u2013 it just made it easy for me. It wasn\u2019t a hard decision. \u201cWe had some conversations about QPR and so did my dad. I think my dad spoke to Harry quite a lot. But it wasn\u2019t really an option for me. \u201cI had 13 years at Chelsea and it\u2019s something very dear to me so it would have been difficult to play for a club so close. So from that point of view, coming out here to New York is a good option \u2013 it\u2019s a new start.\u201d Lampard received the warmest of welcomes from football mad fans desperate to get a glimpse of the new hero in town. But he was quick to respond to claims he was disrespectful to New York in the wake of the 11 September terror attacks in 2001. The 36-year-old was with a group of team-mates who were fined by Chelsea for insulting US tourists in a west London hotel hours after the atrocities. \u201cI have some regrets. I was naive and a young boy at the time,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI was out on a day I shouldn\u2019t have been \u2013 I certainly wouldn\u2019t do it today, put it that way. It\u2019s very important to pay respect. There\u2019s a huge memorial and I will certainly go there to pay my respects.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
