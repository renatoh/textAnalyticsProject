Mike Pence, the vice-president and taskforce chair, said on Tuesday that coordination of the pandemic response could be transferred back to federal agencies in late May or early June. But in the wake of a leaked internal White House report suggesting that the daily US death toll will climb to 3,000 per day by June, the move is likely to fuel concerns that Trump has all but abandoned a public health strategy in favour of economic imperatives. \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes,\u201d Trump said during a trip to Arizona \u2013 a battleground state in the 2020 presidential election \u2013 on Tuesday. \u201cBut we have to get our country open, and we have to get it open soon.\u201d In an interview with David Muir of ABC News on Tuesday evening, Trump was asked directly: \u201cDo you believe it\u2019s the reality we\u2019re facing, that lives will be lost to reopen the country?\u201d The president said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible there will be some because you won\u2019t be locked into an apartment or a house or whatever it is, but at the same time we\u2019re going to practise social distancing, we\u2019re going to be washing hands, we\u2019re going to be doing a lot of the things that we\u2019ve learned to do over the last period of time. And we have to get our country back.\u201d A prolonged shutdown, Trump added, came with its own costs in terms of increased drug use and suicide. Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state and 2016 presidential candidate, tweeted: \u201cIt appears the plan is, shamefully, to have no plan. Americans will suffer. We must replace this administration in November.\u201d David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama, added on Twitter: \u201cIf you can\u2019t shut down the virus, shut down the taskforce.\u201d Pence was responding on Tuesday to questions about a New York Times report that said officials in the Trump administration were telling the 22 taskforce members and their staff to expect the group to be phased out within weeks. \u201cI think we\u2019re starting to look at the Memorial Day [25 May] window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage our national response in a more traditional manner,\u201d the vice-president said, according to a pool report. Pence insisted that \u201cit really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we\u2019ve made as a country\u201d and promised to keep the response coordinator, Deborah Birx, \u201caround every bit as long as we need to\u201d. Birx herself said: \u201cWe\u2019ll still keep a close eye on the data because we have very good data now. It took us a while to build that capacity. And we\u2019ll make sure that, you know, we\u2019re watching that at a federal level.\u201d But there was also immediate confusion. Even as Pence spoke, Anthony Fauci, a leading taskforce member, was denying the Times\u2019s report. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d the infectious disease expert told CBS News. \u201cI\u2019ve been in every taskforce meeting, and that\u2019s not what they are doing.\u201d The taskforce was created in late January and Pence was named as chairman in late February. It met frequently to address the rapidly spreading pandemic and then explained its work in nightly press briefings dominated by Trump that sometimes lasted more than two hours. But the president was accused of using the platform to score political points, with Republican allies eventually warning that the briefings were damaging him at the polls. After a briefing in which Trump floated the idea of treating the virus with disinfectant injections, the events were soon killed off. There has now been no briefing for more than a week and the taskforce is meeting less frequently. Its demise would be the latest sign that the White House is pivoting towards the first phase of Trump\u2019s plan to reopen the country after many states ordered people to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus. The president has urged supporters to \u201cliberate\u201d states from pandemic restrictions and signalled approval for armed protesters who have defied his own social distancing guidelines. On Sunday, Trump held a Fox News virtual town hall at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington and was joined by Pence and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, putting an emphasis on the economy. Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host whom Trump follows closely, applauded the winding up of the taskforce. \u201cFor too long it seemed like unelected doctors were making policy,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cEconomic toll was disastrous.\u201d Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, denied that health concerns were being neglected: \u201cReporting on the task force is being misconstrued to suggest the White House is no longer involving medical experts,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThis is totally false. President Trump will continue his data-driven approach towards safely re-opening.\u201d But to critics, the timing is awry. On Monday, researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation almost doubled its previous US mortality model to more than 134,000 from 72,400 on 29 April. The change reflected \u201crising mobility in most US states\u201d with an easing of business closures and stay-at-home orders expected in 31 states by 11 May, the institute said. Fauci warned in a CNN interview on Monday that there would be a \u201crebound\u201d of new coronavirus cases in the US if the country rushes towards a \u201cpremature\u201d reopening of society and business. \u201cHow many deaths and how much suffering are you willing to accept to get back to what you want to be some form of normality sooner rather than later?\u201d he asked. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the governance studies programme at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said any attempt to sideline Birx and Fauci was doomed. \u201cHe might try to marginalise them but the press isn\u2019t going to try to marginalise them. \u201cThey are the people with the data and with the expertise and nobody with data and expertise is going to be marginalised. It\u2019s going to be the politicians who don\u2019t listen to the scientists who are going to get marginalised.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
