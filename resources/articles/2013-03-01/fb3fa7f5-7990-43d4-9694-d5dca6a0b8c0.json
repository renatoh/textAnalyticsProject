It is a botched job - too many last-minute fixes, too little transparency. But the outcry about statutory underpinning strikes me as misjudged. Whether a statute is good or bad depends on what is in it. No doubt King John thought Magna Carta was a terrible idea. The defamation bill will surely be hailed with relief by the press when it reaches the statute book. Energies would be better spent just now on the many adjustments that need to be made to the Cameron charter, especially incentives for the recalcitrant press to join a system of protection for victims without crippling responsible \u2013 and irreverent \u2013 journalism. Press and campaigners should seek to restore without equivocation the intent of the first paragraphs of three of the draft bills jettisoned for the makeshift royal charter. They required authorities to honour the freedom of the press to communicate opinion and information independently of parliament and the executive, and defend the independence of the new regulator. So concerned with a fantasy statute, the press may well miss a historic opportunity here to entrench the freedom of the press. Second, the punitive exemplary damages are not likely to survive the courts. Support is justified for the amendment being tabled by Lord Lester on libel and media intrusion. It is designed to afford a public-interest defence for publishers and writers who can demonstrate in the courts that they have acted responsibly, to high professional standards, whether or not they have chosen to subscribe to the regulatory body.
