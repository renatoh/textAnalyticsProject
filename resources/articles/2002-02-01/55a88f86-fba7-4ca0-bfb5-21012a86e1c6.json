That this is true is taken for granted. It is my belief, however, that instead of asking whether sportsmen are good role models for our kids, we should be asking whether our kids are good role models for sportsmen. Certainly all the evidence points in that direction. We know, for example, that the stars of the 1950s were gentlemen to a man (I make a point never to comment on the behaviour of women. Firstly because I am a gentleman myself and secondly because the letters one receives if one does are very, very scary). They played fair, spoke only when asked a direct question, shrugged off defeat and reacted to victory with no more than a shy smile and a muttered, \"Golly, what a stroke of luck!\" As to the children of the same era, well, we have only to consult the collected works of the great Nigel Molesworth to see that they were, if anything, even more unruly, insubordinate and violent than the present generation. They were, as the author of Down With Skool! so memorably sums up his contemporaries, \"oiks, tuoughs, weeds, wets, bulies, snekes, cads, dolts and knaves\". Since sportsmen's conduct has got worse over the past four decades and that of youngsters remained at much the same execrable level, it is my contention that, far from children's behaviour deteriorating as a result of copying sports people, it is athletes' behaviour that has gone downhill as a consequence of imitating children. Faking injury to get others into trouble, falling over at the slightest push, throwing tantrums when denied victory, random or retaliatory violence and the constant questioning of every statement or decision made by anybody in authority (for parents substitute referees), all these things have gradually crept from the playground into the stadium. The timing of the collapse in player morality adds weight to the argument. In the era of Matthews and Compton blokes left home early in the morning, returning only after their offspring were safely locked away in the nursery. On Sundays while the children ran loose, the sporting father hid himself away in a convenient shed. Then a social revolution occurred. As a result since the mid-1960s sportsmen have been exposed to the pernicious influence of youngsters almost daily. The effect has not been edifying. In a cafe at the weekend I witnessed a horrific scene. A gang of children, some of them mere babies, were running about the place, yelling, throwing food, exposing their bottoms to total strangers and demanding that respectable women exposed their breasts for their benefit and enjoyment. Youthful exuberance some might say. But I could not help wondering what the effects would have been if a group of impressionable young footballers had been present? Would they not have been tempted to imitate such appalling behaviour? It is all very well to fulminate against the exploits of John Terry and Jody Morris, reprehensible as they have been, but one has to ask what kind of example they are being set by the nation's under-sevens. Of course, we all know that being a child is a short career that can be ended any moment by a brutal collision with puberty but things have changed. The authorities have acted to outlaw common practices of the past such as the whack from behind, leaving the old-fashioned, uncompromising enforcers of yesteryear such as Mr \"Bites Yer Legs\" Chips chuckling ruefully about how, if they were still involved in the game, Esther Rantzen would have had them jailed by now. And childhood is no longer an amateur pastime, to be enjoyed only when the serious business of cleaning chimneys, polishing shoes or picking pockets is done. Nowadays it is fully professional and the financial rewards for the youngster are greater than ever before. Surely with that comes some form of responsibility? For that reason and for the sake of Martin Johnson and his fellow sports stars, I feel it is time we threw the book at misbehaving infants - and the board rubber and chalk too, if necessary. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
