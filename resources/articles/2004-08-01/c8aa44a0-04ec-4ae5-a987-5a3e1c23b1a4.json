Of course, if Mancunians had to endure London Bridge station and fight their way through the capital, they'd probably adopt the tired snarl and I'd-tell-you-to-eff-off-if-I-had-the-nerve expression of Londoners. But not everywhere in the north-west enjoys the benefits of the Metrolink tram. The decision to abandon the planned extension still appals many locals. \"Manchester is a far easier and more pleasant place to be than Stockport, where I live, which is smelly, noisy, choked with traffic and SMBC's traffic policy is abysmal,\" Frieda Chorlton wrote to the letters page of the Stockport Express. \"I believe in the light rail transport system and I think the government has withdrawn its support partly due to the success of the link. Call it jealousy of the north if you like... Blair and his capital see [Manchester] as a threat to London.\" Now, Frieda, that's going a bit too far. Michael Anderson of Tulse Hill in the south of the capital tells readers he wants to move back to Stockport. \"Everything down here is focused on London, London, London, Radio, TV, jobs, you name it. Arrogance and ill-manners. We should all go to the centre of London to protest about this.\" I think you'll find Ken Livingstone exercises pretty strict control over what goes on in Trafalgar Square, Michael. The last thing he's going to allow is a demo calling for better public transport in another city. _________________________________ \"If you've got a big hammer you can get a lot of business at the moment,\" David Sapsford, Liverpool University's professor of applied economics, told the Northerner yesterday. Demolition is big business on Merseyside. Such big business, in fact, that Scousers who fled Liverpool during the long recessions of the 1970s and 1980s are being urged to return to Merseyside and take advantage of cheap property prices there. The Daily Post was understandably intrigued. \"Give Us Back Your Scousers\" - no, really - is appealing to expatriate Scousers who grew up or studied in the city to help fill some of the vacancies created by the city's grand scale redevelopment projects. Construction and retail firms are trying to recruit 8,000 people to work at the GBP750m Albert and King's Docks developments alone. \"Come back home to Liverpool,\" pleads Liverpool Needs You's website. \"Your city needs you.\" If knocking things down and rebuilding doesn't appeal, there are also plenty of jobs in retail. \"Skilled workers are in very short supply,\" confirmed Prof Sapsford. \"The biotechnology sector is very large at the moment and growing very rapidly.\" The expansion of Liverpool John Lennon airport has also created many new jobs. The city, which was once a byword for unemployment and deprivation, now has an unemployment rate of 2.9% and the fastest rate of job creation outside London. \"We're finding it increasingly difficult to fill vacancies,\" Mike Hill, the director of a Merseyside recruitment consultancy and the architect of the campaign, told the Northerner yesterday. Many of the emigres spent three years studying in Liverpool, but \"once they'd done a degree, they decided there weren't sufficient opportunities in the city,\" Mr Hill said. Liverpool's population fell by 300,000 between 1972 and 2002. In recent months, however, the city centre has undergone a minor renaissance. Property prices have risen sharply as a result, though the number of houses changing hands fell this year. Lack of housing stock and fewer first-time buyers with sufficient funds is thought to be responsible. An influx of skilled professionals would make things even more difficult for first-time buyers, Mr Hill admitted. \"We envisage that the vast majority of people will come from either the south-east or Manchester. If you look at house prices in Manchester or London, one of the nice things about Liverpool is that there is the opportunity to upgrade.\" Failure to attract enough workers, he warned, could lead to wage inflation, scupper planned developments and tip the city back into recession. Liverpudlians were accustomed to the notion of economic mobility, he added. Many are the descendants of families who left Ireland in the 19th century. The surge in the city's economy echoes the boom in Ireland during the 1990s, when many Britons of Irish descent headed back across the water. ________________________________ The Environment Agency issued scores of flood warnings and even patrolled the streets of Sheffield with a loudhailer to warn of the danger the river Sheaf would burst its banks. In the end, however, the river banks held; the drains didn't. A month's worth of rain fell in 24 hours over parts of the Pennines and Sheffield, leaving cars stranded in surface water. \"This is the third time it has happened this year, but it is the worst so far,\" a Sheffield hairdresser with a drenched carpet and flooded basement complained to the Yorkshire Post. The Environment Agency was unable to offer any consolation. Unless carbon dioxide emissions were reduced, it said, freak weather conditions would occur more and more frequently. ______________________________ Never mind the flooded basements. Liverpool's Daily Post has asked readers to help it find a far larger body of water which is apparently lurking under Toxteth in Liverpool. The Cains brewery in Stanhope Street, a red brick edifice built in the mid-19th century, is thought to harbour a lake. \"Stories... tell of a large, deep mass of water at a great depth beneath the Liverpool plant where workmen used a boat to travel beneath the cellars,\" breathed the paper. \"Other tales tell how it couldn't be used for drinking water because it is badly contaminated by nearby cemeteries.\" How did they know, the Northerner wonders? The only employee thought to have known more about the whereabouts of the lake died two weeks ago. Unfortunately, for the Post, the directors of Cains appear to be wary of allowing amateur marine archaeologists to penetrate their brewery. \"People need to understand that the brewery site is vast and the cellars are incredibly deep and we are so busy we haven't got time to look for it,\" the joint managing director, Ajmail Dusanj, warned readers. Some might regard that as a challenge. ___________________________________ DAVID WARD RECOMMENDS...
