The natural order of things has been turned upside down. Union is poaching players from league, Britain has won an Olympic skiing medal, Scottish Nationalists call on their fellow countrymen to support the England football team, and blokes in the pub declare that \"Craig Bellamy's injury could determine the outcome of the Premiership\" without accompanying guffaws of sarcastic laughter. It's the sort of turbulence the crazed and fiery prophet Ezekiel (the Old Testament's answer to John McCririck) predicted would foreshadow the ultimate battle between Good and Evil - a fact which will surely not be overlooked by Don King as he searches for a tag-line for Lewis-Tyson. When all is turmoil, mankind seeks succour from the familiar, a constant amid the flux. Thank heavens then for renewed allegations about fiscal shenanigans within Fifa. Like the phrase \"Woodward's men choke\", this is a rock we can cling to as the waters of change rage about us. The latest comforting tale from Zurich came in the form of unsubstantiated reports that on the eve of the 1998 Fifa presidential elections an associate of the eventual winner Sepp Blatter sought out wavering voters and handed them sporting bureaucracy's equivalent of the party bag (contents as yet unknown, though rumours suggest that a large roll of cash, a Rugrats balloon and a packet of Chewits may have featured). These allegations have surfaced and been quashed before, but like the one about Herr Blatter and the World Society of Friends of Suspenders (the whisperers say he was once president of this \"international organisation pledged to the preservation of traditional ladies' hosiery\") they keep bobbing up. In large measure this is surely down to the bizarre milieu of Fifa itself. Anyone who has flicked through the TV channels in a European hotel room will be familiar with the Italian station Rai Uno. As far as I can tell, Rai Uno's entire output consists of shows featuring a dumpy middle-aged man in a tuxedo who spends his time flirting with women half his age and twice his height. In between these bouts of sophisticated romantic drollery the audience is entertained by a dance troupe who do the Hustle apparently oblivious to the fact that one day the combination of static from the polyester and fumes from the hair lacquer will result in the whole studio being consumed by a fireball. This world is completely unrecognisable as any form of reality. Unless, that is, you happen to have attended any major event organised by Fifa. In this head-spinning world it is possible for all sorts of perfectly innocent actions to be misinterpreted. Nevertheless one of Herr Blatter's main rivals, Issa Hayatou of Cameroon, has seized the occasion and is said to have been rallying support for a takeover bid at the elections due to be held in May. And the head of the African Football Confederation apparently visited Salt Lake City last month, leading some to suggest that the president of the International Olympic Committee Jacques Rogge is somehow involved - encouraging rebel forces within football as they carry out covert operations against the ruling elite. Why the IOC should be interested in who runs Fifa is a matter of conjecture. According to some, Rogge is simply interested in cleaning up the image of sports administration - a task that is the equivalent of tackling the Augean Stables during an outbreak of equine dysentery. A more Machiavellian interpretation may be that, since Blatter took over, Fifa has begun to challenge the hegemony of the IOC (whose previous president declared it the second most powerful organisation in the world after the UN). This was brought home to the Olympians when Blatter made public his desire to hold the World Cup every two years, an action which would surely lead to a fierce battle between the two bodies for corporate sponsorship, not to mention the lebensraum of the TV schedules. Fortunately for those of us who need some stability in our sporting lives, the sleek Swiss seems likely to survive and with him the constant controversy. True, he does not look in great shape at the moment. But as his opponents will discover, it is a dangerous business to kick Sepp Blatter when he is down. And not because of the possibility of breaking your toe on his corset, either. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
