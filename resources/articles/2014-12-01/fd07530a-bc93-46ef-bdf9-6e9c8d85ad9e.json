Before this week\u2019s official start to the runup to the 2015 general election, the Observer can reveal that the Conservatives have ignored Electoral Commission recommendations and secured a 23% increase in spending. With the Tories having amassed a \u00a378m war chest over the past four years, they can now funnel huge amounts of cash into key seats. The change to the law on candidates\u2019 election spending, passed without parliamentary debate, was made despite a direct warning by the commission against such \u201cexcessive spending to prevent the perception of undue influence over the outcome of the election\u201d. Lucy Powell MP, Ed Miliband\u2019s key general election strategist, admitted that Labour \u201ccan\u2019t match the depths of Tory pockets\u201d and accused the prime minister of seeking to \u201cbuy an election they don\u2019t deserve to win\u201d. Writing on this newspaper\u2019s website, she says: \u201cWith only a record of failure to run on, David Cameron\u2019s campaign is reliant on smear, fear and fat cats\u2019 cheque books. This is a party flush with big money backers but without the empathy or ideas the country needs, so they are rigging the rules of our democracy in their favour. \u201cWhen he was first leader of the opposition, David Cameron said he wanted to take the big money out of politics. He promised to address the \u2018big donor culture\u2019, arguing that we should, \u2018cut what is spent on a general election\u2019. Yet he has now cynically changed his tune. Desperate to hang on to power, the Tories have quietly changed the rules to allow them to spend big in the runup to the election. The changes would allow them to spend millions more than they\u2019re presently allowed, paving the way for Tory propaganda to flood constituencies.\u201d Under the new limits, the total amount the candidates of each political party can spend has increased from \u00a326.5m to \u00a332.7m. In March, the Electoral Commission recommended there should be no such increase in spending limits for candidates over the so-called \u201clong campaign\u201d period between 19 December and general election day on 7 May. It suggested there should only be an increase of \u00a32.9m on spending during the \u201cshort campaign\u201d, which starts 25 days before the election, to take account of inflation and some changes in the length of the election campaign. At the time the commission dismissed the Conservative party\u2019s submission that there should be a bigger rise because \u201cnew developments in campaigning technology are not making politics cheaper\u201d. It has now emerged that the government went ahead in the summer and slipped through increases twice those recommended by the commission. The Observer has learned that ministers changed the law through a statutory instrument, the terms of which were not debated in the Commons, and which is more usually a vehicle for consensual changes in the law. A Labour source said that the move had not been spotted by them at the time and so they missed the chance to force a vote in the Commons. The Conservatives, who are paying the Australian strategist Lynton Crosby \u00a3500,000 to mastermind their campaign, are in a strong position to take advantage of their changes because the donations they receive vastly outstrip that of the other parties. This summer alone, the Tories accepted more than double the \u00a33.1m that Miliband\u2019s party received. In the past four years the Tories have raised \u00a378,010,807, with \u00a321,072,508 (27%) coming from hedge fund donors. George Osborne\u2019s 2013 budget abolished stamp duty reserve tax on funds, a \u00a3145m giveaway to hedge funds. Since the last general election, the Tories have also received \u00a36m from secretive unincorporated associations, such as dinner clubs, which do not need to declare the identities of their members. This year the Carlton Club political committee, and the United and Cecil club have accelerated their donations to marginal seats, according to electoral commission figures. In the last quarter, 34 Conservative associations, all in marginal seats, received between \u00a32,500 and \u00a37,500 from the two clubs, totalling \u00a3116,600. The United and Cecil Club, whose honorary secretary is a former tobacco lobbyist, has made 59 donations to key seats since 2010. A donor who gives through a members\u2019 club is only named by the commission if their gift is in excess of \u00a37,500. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \u201cIt is crucial in a robust democracy that candidates are provided with a reasonable level of expenditure which would enable them to communicate properly with voters. An MP who wanted a debate on the rise could have called for one in the usual way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
