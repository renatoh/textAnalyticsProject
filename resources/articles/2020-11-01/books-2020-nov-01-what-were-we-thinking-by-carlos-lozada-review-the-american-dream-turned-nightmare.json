A chronicle of a so-called era that has lasted less than four noisy, nerve-racking years and with luck is about to end? A book that solemnly analyses 150 often trashy books about someone who is not known to have read a single book and hired stooges to write the 20 self-puffing volumes published in his name? Yes, Carlos Lozada\u2019s survey of what he archly calls \u201cTrump Studies\u201d is all of those paradoxical things and it is an utter marvel: sober though frequently very funny, fairer minded than the subject deserves, in the end profoundly troubling even as it looks ahead to America\u2019s recovery from the Trump malaise. Lozada, a book reviewer for the Washington Post, approaches his binge-reading chore as an exercise in cultural criticism. Trump may be thoughtless but he is also unthinkable: no one could have anticipated such an affront to institutional precedent, legal restraint, civic decorum and human decency. Some of the writers discussed by Lozada therefore seek the ogre\u2019s origins in the abyss that gave birth to Prospero\u2019s Caliban, Frankenstein\u2019s monster and Batman\u2019s Joker. For one sociologist, Trump emerges from a \u201cdeep story\u201d \u2013 AKA a myth \u2013 about the festering grudges of the white working class in the disaffected American heartland; another traumatised commentator describes him as \u201cthe confirmation of all past fears, like a recurring childhood nightmare\u201d. Seen this way, Trump is archetypally coughed up from our psychic sludge. Imagine King Kong with a strawberry-blond comb-over or, according to the eyewitness testimony of Stormy Daniels, an abominable snowman whose penis, like a dwarfish toadstool, nestles among \u201cyeti pubes\u201d. Trump\u2019s electoral promises in 2016 mapped a monster-ridden fantasyland. Hence his obsession with a border wall that was never more than a concept, an excuse for him to brag about his prestige as a builder of skyscrapers that likewise seldom made it into the third dimension. Lozada argues that the wall \u201cbegan as a gimmick, morphed into a symbol and grew into a war\u201d. But Trump fervently believes in its impenetrability and patient aides had to explain to him that an airborne virus could float over this non-existent barrier. The wall, like everything else in Trump\u2019s worldview, is an extension of him, \u201cbig and bombastic\u201d, as Lozada says, and also entirely bogus. However, it usefully cancels another more optimistic national myth: the border, according to the historian Greg Grandin, is \u201cthe negation of the frontier\u201d and it enables Trump to shut out migrant hordes by declaring that America \u201chas no more room \u2013 we\u2019re full\u201d. At its most primitive, this kind of conjuring resembles voodoo. The political philosopher Timothy Snyder points out that dictators rely on dictating slogans and catchphrases, repeated until they become \u201cshamanistic incantations\u201d; Trump\u2019s rallies, with their choral shouts from the MAGA-capped mob, are just such a retreat into mindlessness. It\u2019s no surprise that, when outlining his magical prescription for overcoming Covid-19, Trump extolled \u201cherd mentality\u201d rather than \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Other analysts emphasise Trump\u2019s reliance on slippery fiction, not atavistic myth. Amanda Carpenter, a conservative speechwriter sickened by Trump\u2019s betrayal, contends that \u201che can\u2019t compete in everyone else\u2019s reality, so he creates his own\u201d, usually in the form of retweeted conspiracy theories about paedophile cabals that have Hillary Clinton as their den mother and set up shop in the basement of pizza restaurants. Compounding lies or replacing them with ever more outrageous whoppers, he follows the logic of television soap operas or reality shows, which adjust the \u201cnarrative\u201d as they go along. The MSNBC host Joy-Ann Reid, a Trump opponent, views the current election as a programming matter. \u201cAmerica,\u201d she says, \u201cwill decide what story it wants to tell about itself\u201d. Should The Trump Show be renewed next season or do we need to \u201cfundamentally change the script\u201d? What we need to fundamentally change, as Lozada demonstrates, is the way we think. Many of the writers cited by Lozada refer a little tremulously to \u201cthe American experiment\u201d, a project that after more than two centuries is still provisional, put at risk by Trump\u2019s bigoted isolationism and his authoritarian thuggery. The need for a reckoning seems particularly urgent to Lozada, who was born in Peru and gained US citizenship just in time for the 2016 election. Trump imperils the American dream of such aspirants, which is why Lozada applauds the philosopher Yuval Levin when he summons voters on to the streets to \u201cenact democracy\u201d. That rallying cry resonates across the ocean. Embodying a soft, flabby fascism, Trump authorises campaign ads in which he sports a Superman T-shirt and, as the Fox News harpy Jeanine Pirro purrs, exhibits his \u201cKryptonite-proof aura of invincibility\u201d. It will take more than a few desultory push-ups to make a muscle-bound bruiser out of Boris, but he too equates performance on camera with leadership and mistakes his own narcissism for national pride. What were we (by which I mean some of us) thinking when we sentenced the UK to a future of impoverished insularity, elected a Trump-tongueing charlatan to govern it and then expected him to bother about saving our lives in a pandemic? Or, to further abbreviate the title of Lozada\u2019s brief history, WTF? \u2022 What Were We Thinking by Carlos Lozada is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a320).
