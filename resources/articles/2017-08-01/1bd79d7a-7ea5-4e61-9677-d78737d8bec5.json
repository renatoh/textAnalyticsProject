The four soloists and members of the chorus and orchestra gave their services for free for the one-off fundraiser, which took place in one of the most affluent neighbourhoods of west London. Many in the audience on Tuesday night made extra donations online or in charity buckets around the venue, and cash was also donated by those unable to secure tickets. Proceeds from bar sales were added to the total, which went to the Rugby Portobello Trust, one of the main community organisations in North Kensington. OHP lost one of its members of staff in the fire on 14 June, which killed at least 80 people and destroyed the 24-storey Grenfell Tower. Deborah Lamprell, 45, who has yet to be formally identified, worked front of house at the opera. She lived on the 16th floor of Grenfell Tower and was last heard from when she texted her mother at 11.30pm on the night of the fire to say she had got home from work safely. \u201cDebbie was a lovely, lovely person,\u201d said Michael Volpe, OHP\u2019s general director. \u201cShe had an ultra down-to-earth manner. She knew everybody here, but she also knew their mothers, sisters, children. \u201cShe was the most dedicated person, a perfect employee. For her to be taken was awful. Tonight will be an enormously emotional evening for everyone here.\u201d Volpe, who grew up on a council estate near Grenfell Tower and described himself as \u201ca proper west Londoner\u201d, said the idea of mounting a fundraising performance emerged in the first few days after the fire. \u201cIt affected us all in so many ways. A much-loved member of our team was lost, and geographically we\u2019re very close by. We thought, let\u2019s try to raise a few quid. We put out some feelers and were inundated with requests to sing.\u201d He rejected criticism that OHP was elitist or an unworthy beneficiary of public money, saying he and James Clutton, its director of opera, were \u201cpretty leftwing\u201d. \u201cIf we were asked the question: \u2018Should money be spent on opera or social housing?\u2019, you\u2019d only get one answer. But we don\u2019t believe it should be a choice. \u201cWe\u2019re probably the most accessible opera festival in the country. So it was a bitter irony for us to come under attack, having lost a friend and having a long association with this part of London.\u201d He said most of OHP\u2019s staff were working-class people, and the festival gave away 1,500 tickets each summer. It also offered discounted tickets to NHS workers, police and ambulance services, and last month hosted a free family day, attended by 1,000 people. Funding from Kensington and Chelsea council ceased two years ago with a \u00a35m grant from reserves aimed at helping OHP become a self-supporting charity. Its annual operating costs of \u00a34.1m are now covered mainly from box office sales, corporate and individual sponsorship and donations. Bill Goodall, who travelled from Woodford in east London for the performance, said he was equally keen to hear the Requiem and support a worthy cause. \u201cIt\u2019s terrific that OHP are doing this. I watched the fire with complete horror and a sense of disbelief,\u201d he said. Sarah, who declined to give her surname, had come from Bermondsey in south London. \u201cI\u2019m not local, but the fire touched everybody, didn\u2019t it? My heart went out to people.\u201d The Rugby Portobello Trust said it had distributed \u00a31.3m in emergency cash and grants to bereaved families, and was organising activities and outings for children and families over the summer. The OHP performance was one of several fundraising initiatives for Grenfell survivors and families. An online auction of contemporary art, which closed on Tuesday, raised up to \u00a340,000 after artists including Tracey Emin, Gavin Turk and Cornelia Parker donated works. Lucy Meakin, who organised the auction, said she was overwhelmed at the generosity of artists and galleries and the response of the public. \u201cEvery artist I know immediately offered an artwork, and a good artwork. I\u2019m really happy that everyone has been so supportive.\u201d Next month, Queens Park Rangers will host a celebrity football match in support of the North Kensington community. Teams of former footballers and entertainers will play at Loftus Road stadium, one mile from Grenfell Tower. Among those billed to play in #Game4Grenfell are Les Ferdinand, David Seaman, Trevor Sinclair and Alan Shearer. They will be joined by Marcus Mumford, Olly Murs, Damian Lewis and Jarvis Cocker. More than 2,000 tickets will be given to people directly affected by the fire, including families, emergency services, volunteers and local residents. The QPR chairman, Tony Fernandes, said: \u201cIt will take years, and in some cases a lifetime, for our community to recover from this. We hope this match, this event, this demonstration of support, will help in some small way to show that all those who have been affected are not alone. We all stand together.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
