But is it even about Brisbane? Separate interviews with the surviving members of the band reveal very different viewpoints and memories about the song\u2019s genesis, recording and legacy. The writing Streets of Your Town was written in Sydney shortly before the recording of the Go-Betweens\u2019 sixth album, 16 Lovers Lane, in 1988. Grant McLennan was in a relationship with multi-instrumentalist Amanda Brown when he wrote it. It was unusual in that the band\u2019s co-founder, Robert Forster, had not heard the song before it was brought to the group. McLennan died in 2006. Amanda Brown (violin, guitar, oboe): \u201cGrant and I were living together in Bondi Junction in Sydney, and that song was written very quickly in our sunny top-floor flat \u2026 It was written in, I would say, 10 minutes. I was singing along and I sung that \u2018shine\u2019 line, which is like the call and response answer in the verses, and that\u2019s pretty much it \u2013 that\u2019s how it came about. And I don\u2019t collect any songwriting royalties for that song, because that was a condition of my joining the band.\u201d Lindy Morrison (drums): \u201cWe were in a park in Glebe when Amanda and Grant played the song to us for the first time, and I guess I was hearing it through Robert\u2019s reaction, because Robert was so shocked. So I was feeling his pain, but that didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t see how magnificent that song was.\u201d Robert Forster (singer-songwriter, guitarist, band co-founder): \u201cThe fact that I hadn\u2019t heard the song, it did miff me \u2026 Every other song from every other album that we\u2019d done before that, and every album that we did after, I knew all the songs that Grant had. This was the one song that I didn\u2019t. But a week later it was fine. That was the thing with Grant and I, we didn\u2019t yell and scream at each other. There\u2019s things that I did to him that he must have just had to swallow, too.\u201d Amanda Brown: \u201cWhat I do remember is sitting down with [producer] Mark Wallis somewhere and Grant saying, \u2018And we\u2019ve got this one\u2019, and then just singing it with me, and Mark hearing it and going, \u2018Oh, we have to record that song.\u2019 Probably everybody concurs that it was a late addition to the album. And, I hasten to add, everybody [else] was dead against recording it as well.\u201d Lindy Morrison: \u201cWe all knew that it was going to be the single.\u201d Robert Forster: \u201cYou don\u2019t go into an album thinking this is going to be the single. It just felt like one of the other songs. It\u2019s only really in the studio, [when] you get to the end of the session, that you go, ooh \u2013 we\u2019ve got this, this is the single.\u201d Lindy Morrison: \u201cOh no, that\u2019s rubbish. Because it was so good, I mean, come on Robert! It was so hooky! It was such a standout. And to see the two of them play that together, and Amanda doing that backing vocal \u2018shine\u2019, you know, she composed that, and it\u2019s a hook.\u201d Amanda Brown: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of pointless to bear grudges about it. The band gave me lots of good things that I\u2019m very grateful for, but at the same time there was a pretty concerted effort to erase, in particular, mine and Lindy\u2019s contribution to the band.\u201d Robert Forster: \u201cThe one person who could really speak to that isn\u2019t here to defend himself.\u201d The recording 16 Lovers Lane was recorded with English producer Mark Wallis in Studios 301, Sydney, in May. Lindy Morrison: \u201cBecause it was the single, there was an enormous amount of pressure on me to use a drum machine. And that was fine by me because I understood that a single had to be treated differently. It was my beat that I programmed into it, so it\u2019s exactly as I would play it.\u201d Amanda Brown: \u201cI remember multi-tracking the vocals and Mark always telling me to sing it softer. We did several takes that were just really whispered, and at the time I was a bit suspicious of that process, because I didn\u2019t want to sound like some fey Jane Birkin-esque ingenue.\u201d Robert Forster: \u201cStreets was always difficult to play live, if only because the flamenco guitar solo is done by [bass player] John Willsteed, and when we were playing live he was on bass. So it was much more of a studio construction, and maybe the best version of it ever is on the album.\u201d Amanda Brown: \u201cJohn\u2019s bassline was actually played on a guitar, on an octave pedal, so that\u2019s why it has such a distinctive sound. It was a nylon-string classical guitar he played the solo on \u2013 it might have even been a crappy old guitar of mine that just happened to be lying around.\u201d John Willsteed (bass, guitar): \u201cIt was Amanda\u2019s guitar \u2026 I probably did a couple of takes. I know that the ending got fucked up \u2013 I didn\u2019t have an end, so had to kind of glue an ending on. I\u2019ve never been happy with the ending.\u201d Robert Forster: \u201cJohn Willsteed and Amanda were the great musicians in the band \u2026 Not every great musician gets that opportunity of being in a world-class studio, with a world-class engineer-producer with good songs, and that came to John, which I\u2019m really happy about.\u201d Streets of whose town? Streets of Your Town has long been identified with Brisbane, and has featured in an advertising campaign by Queensland newspaper the Courier-Mail (with the darker lyrics omitted). The Go Between Bridge, spanning the Brisbane river, is also named after the group. Yet it remains a source of passionate conjecture which \u201ctown\u201d the song refers to. Lindy Morrison: \u201cI always thought it was about Brisbane, because of the buildings being torn down; the nostalgia expressed for a town that once was. The most important thing I want to say is that Brisbane took it on as their own, so the Brisbane community grabbed it and ran with it, and because of that, for me, the song is about Brisbane. It\u2019s owned by the Brisbane community. But Amanda will have a different story, and Amanda was a lot closer to Grant than I was.\u201d Amanda Brown: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a few things to say about that. Firstly, is it important? It\u2019s quite a universal thing, which is how the controversy or perhaps the misconception has come about, because everybody thinks it relates to their town.\u201d Robert Forster: \u201cIt was written in Sydney, and a lot of the songs that Grant was writing around that time involved Amanda. Streets of Your Town, it could be Sydney, because that was Amanda\u2019s town. But I really don\u2019t know.\u201d Amanda Brown: \u201cThere\u2019s reasons for and against. First is the title, Streets of Your Town, the possessive noun there being, I think, in relation to me. But the song\u2019s bridge \u2013 They shut it down, they pulled it down \u2013 Brisbane people of that generation would feel that keenly, with Cloudland and other beloved buildings being torn down in the dead of night by the infamous Deen Brothers. In Sydney, it was the beautiful Regent Theatre. There\u2019s also the line I ride your river under the bridge, and I take your boat out to the reach \u2013 it could relate to Brisbane, of course, being a river town, and Sydney more commonly being known as a harbour town, although it does have rivers as well.\u201d John Willsteed: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really centred anywhere. I know Grant wrote it in Sydney, and if he wrote it about running around after Amanda in her town, then I guess that\u2019s Sydney. But at the same time there\u2019s the river, and the bridge. Maybe it\u2019s a beautiful amalgam of Grant\u2019s experiences!\u201d Amanda Brown: \u201cIt\u2019s a widely misunderstood song, in the same vein as something like [Bruce Springsteen\u2019s] Born in the USA \u2013 people think it\u2019s that kind of patriotic, parochial sentiment. It\u2019s actually very dark, with the lyrics about butcher\u2019s knives and battered wives. There\u2019s a lot more awareness of domestic violence now, so it\u2019s a very relevant song.\u201d Lindy Morrison: \u201cIt\u2019s really funny. It\u2019s always the same, everybody\u2019s got a different perspective, haven\u2019t they?\u201d The legacy Despite being the glossiest production of the Go-Betweens\u2019 career, Streets of Your Town wasn\u2019t a hit, stalling at 70 on the Australian charts and 80 in the UK, and the band broke up amid acrimony in late 1989. Robert Forster: \u201c[It wasn\u2019t the hit] that the band needed at that stage of our career. But before we went [into the studio], no one would have seen what it became, in terms of its commercial accessibility.\u201d Amanda Brown: \u201cIt\u2019s probably the closest thing to a hit we ever had. It certainly generated the most income of all the songs, and it\u2019s the song that everybody knows.\u201d John Willsteed: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many fucking great songs you make. There\u2019s a whole range of twists of fate that lead you towards something being popular or just disappearing. But obviously, it\u2019s retained some kind of place in people\u2019s cultural memory.\u201d Amanda Brown: \u201cThat duality inherent in the lyrics is really emblematic of Grant as an artist and human. He was charming, affable and loved by all who had the good fortune to know him. \u201cBut privately he was also melancholic, with an ever-present awareness of loss, absence and loneliness, and these qualities are all in his best work. If Streets did not have this, it might be too saccharine, too sweet. \u201cSometimes, when the stars align, we come together in unlikely formation and create something that resonates and touches the soul. I think, for the Go-Betweens, 16 Lovers Lane was such a moment, and Streets was the bittersweet, poppy gem at the heart of the album.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
