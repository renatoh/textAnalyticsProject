He promptly made a perfunctory nonsense last night of any advantage Essex had appeared to hold. Worcestershire were all out for 367 two overs before the end. Bichel, a genuine all-rounder and, by his demeanour a patently happy Queenslander, was last to go, blissfully slogging and skying to deep backward point. He had hit, with democratic efficiency, sixes off John Stephenson, James Middlebrook and Jon Dakin. Most of the shots were clean and purposeful. He has given Worcestershire, his adopted county, a new vigour and intent. Bichel engaged in spirited evening stands with Steve Rhodes and Kabir Ali. By then Essex knew that too many runs had been allowed to slip away. There had been other batting of merit against bowling of modest threat on a pitch that occasionally posed the challenge of varying bounce. Anurag Singh went to his fifty in just under two hours with intelligent care. He was out in the last over before lunch as he stretched well forward and Stephenson found a way through. Graeme Hick has not yet this season scored runs when they really mattered. He appeared to be rectifying this as he emerged from an introspective start. Then in the same over as he cut and pulled Ronnie Irani with almost risible ease, he played no shot and was leg before for 30. It is thought that Hick still harbours hopes of playing in one-day internationals. He continues to mask his aspirations; this season he seems even more bereft of emotion, leaving that broad bat to remind us of the innate talent that lurks within his capricious persona. He might have been caught at cover off Irani on six; he turned away phlegmatically. The only glimmer of visible feeling came when he was given out by John Steele - the glance down the track was more of disbelief than simply disappointment. Ben Smith is clearly an asset: correct, watchful and selective. There were eight boundaries in his fifty and he, too, was an lbw victim, this time to Stephenson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
