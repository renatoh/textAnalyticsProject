His country are top of the Six Nations championship, two wins away from a triumphant grand slam. His club, Saracens, are one point off the top of the Premiership and will shortly host a Heineken Cup quarter-final at Twickenham. By the end of the season, if all goes well, he could have shared in more success than many wings do in their entire careers. Ashton's rugby union journey, though, has never been known for its smooth trajectory. One swallow dive does not make a winter and all that. England may be winning but their happy-go-lucky wing has lost some of his Tigger-style bounce. Instead there is a hint of Eeyore-ishness as he lines up his detractors. \"Apparently I am playing badly but I don't really see it to be honest,\" he says flatly. Patience is clearly required on all sides but international sport waits for no one. Who will prevail in the end? The \"Ash-splashing\" extrovert capable of sniffing out chances no one else can spot? Or the suspect defender low on confidence who believes the world is out to get him? One poor defensive game against France has fuelled the debate, which ultimately boils down to whether England have any better right-wing options. Under the terms of the elite player scheme Christian Wade or Marland Yarde can be promoted to the senior squad only if there are injuries to others. For the next couple of games at least, therefore, Ashton remains in the frame, hoping for a change in fortune. The way he sees it he is the human equivalent of an enthusiastic small dog endlessly chasing a ball that never quite bounces his way. Two years ago he scored four tries against Italy on the Azzurri's last appearance in London. Times, he suggests, have changed as much as he has. \"Games are getting harder, especially in the Six Nations, and those kind of breaks are not coming along any more. I am probably doing too much at the minute, chasing absolutely everything and tiring myself out for the situations when I am actually needed. I am like a dog chasing a ball \u2026 I just chase absolutely everything and when the chance is there I am missing it.\" Along with England's attacking skills coach, Mike Catt, he has been looking at ways to be more selective and help restore the poacher's instinct that brought him 15 tries in his first 17 Tests. He has subsequently managed two in his past 15 internationals. \"I have got so desperate to get on the end of stuff I have just been chasing everything. I just need to sit back and realise the right time to strike.\" But what about when the opposition have the ball? Ashton's tackling technique, specifically his habit of shoulder-charging opponents, was under scrutiny long before Wesley Fofana waltzed past five English challenges to score for France last Saturday. Part of him wonders if people recognise the try-scorer's genius \u2013 \"I got caught by an outstanding player \u2026 at some point Fofana is going to do that again\" \u2013 but he also knows defence cannot be optional. \"I thought there was a lot of heat for one [missed] tackle but at this level you can't really afford to let those things happen.\" Suggestions that he is a defensive liability, however, receive short shrift. \"I don't know where this has come from, all this defence stuff. I am not afraid to tackle. I want to tackle and I want to hurt people, that was the issue with my shoulder charging. I just need to realise it is not always a situation where you can fly in and hurt people. Sometimes people are bigger than you and they are going to get the better of you. You have got to understand what kind of tackle you need to go into and I am working on that every day. I can't fly in and whack people with my shoulder any more, you can't even do that in league.\" Confidence lies at the heart of all this; when Ashton, who turns 26 on 29 March, is flying high good times normally follow. He admits the absence of his former Northampton colleague Ben Foden, displaced at full-back by Saracens' Alex Goode, has made a difference to him. \"Fodes is more like me \u2026 give him the ball in space and he will run in and create stuff. Goodey is more of a 10/full-back \u2026 he goes off and finds himself in the game at 10 or at second receiver so that is definitely something I've had to get used to. All full-backs are different. It is up to me to adjust and find different ways to get into the game.\" In the meantime there is rising frustration. Throwing the ball at Benjamin Fall \u2013 and missing \u2013 in the final seconds of Saturday's victory was just one example. \"Fall was having a bit of a go and trying to get me going the whole game. He was trying to drag me by my neck off the pitch and we had won so I just popped the ball up. I didn't think it would cause a little bit of a scuffle like it did.\" Which, some would say, is the recurring theme. Thinking straight is not always Ashton's strong point; what qualifies as innocuous stuff in Wigan does not always look so clever in high-definition slow-mo in a major fixture. The well-meaning advice of strangers tends to go in one ear and out the other. \"I try not to listen to the outside world \u2013 what is important to me is what the coaches think. I know what I need to do and what I don't need to do \u2026 I put a lot of pressure on myself and I always have.\" With competition for places increasing, even so, another four tries against Italy next week would help to silence the sceptics. What is not in doubt is Ashton's desperation to prolong his England career. \"When it comes to rugby I am 100% committed and I am not happy-go-lucky. Somehow I have got to change that perception by playing well. \"For people to say I am doing stuff wrong and shouldn't be in this team \u2026 it hurts. If I am not scoring a hat-trick and making tackles I am annoyed with myself until the next chance I get. I want to be in this team every week, that is all that matters to me. I don't really care about anything else.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
