Pepsi achieved all that and more this year as its advertising generated the most mentions in the national press. It was the David Beckham gladiator football advert wot won it for Pepsi. \"Becks signs up for Rome\", the Sun blared earlier in the year alongside a half-page photo of the England captain in a leather gladiator outfit, complete with leather Pepsi logo on his breastplate - but readers had to look pretty closely to notice. \"Celebrity sells\" is the clear message of the annual Ads that Make News survey, compiled by Propeller Communications and Durrants Media Monitoring. But the study supports the view that controversy comes a close second. McDonald's was in the news a good deal this year. Its adverts promoting its Salad Plus menu, plus its campaign to fend off the Morgan Spurlock film Supersize Me, where the filmmaker ate nothing but McDonald's for a month, made second place with 32 mentions. The core business of McDonald's places it at the heart of one of the media's hot issues, the obesity epidemic. Walkers Crisps, at number seven with 22 mentions, also felt the increased attention as the press asked if it would bow to pressure and dump Gary Lineker from its ads. Answer: no. The big loser of the year was Sainsbury's. Jamie Oliver has lost his headline-grabbing ability for the store. Sainsbury's, which featured in the top three for the last two years, crashed out of the top 10 this year. If you can combine celebrity and controversy, then you have the perfect PR storm that catapulted The Number 118 118 to number three, with 30 stories. The press loved the fact that 1970s runner David Bedford sued and won a legal action against 118 118 for using his distinctive image without authorisation. The glamorous and very expensive \"mini movie\" for Chanel No 5, starring Nicole Kidman as the most famous woman in the world, was number six, despite only first airing last month. The national press made much of the expense of the three-minuteadvert - reportedly \u00a318m. John Smith did well when a diver who appeared in its advert won a silver medal at the Olympics, which got it to number four with 29 mentions. A Conservative party advert featuring Michael Howard making a new year plea to Guardian readers bought complaints and coverage; Christina Aguilera caught in a seemingly compromising position for Virgin Mobile brought complaints and the numbereight spot; while BT's signing of Jeremy Clarkson saw it sneak in at number 10. But one of the strongest performers was the campaign for Dove firming cream that featured real women with real curves. Without celebrity or controversy, it made the ninth spot. Stephen Brook US television Red Letterman day for CBS Declaring mission accomplished can be a dangerous thing in any circumstances. A year ago, NBC chief Jeff Zucker announced the late-night ratings war on US television was over. Jay Leno on The Tonight Show had been attracting more viewers than his long time CBS rival David Letterman since 1995 and appeared to have an insurmountable lead. That boast could come back to haunt him. Letterman, always the critics' darling, appears to be staging a comeback. Leno regularly pulls in around 5.6m viewers, with Letterman attracting 4.6m. In the current season, though, The Late Show with David Letterman has beaten The Tonight Show six times, each of them on a Monday night. According to figures cited in the New York Times, Letterman has picked up an average 380,000 additional viewers across the week and Leno lost around 290,000. The 11.30pm slot on US TV is regarded as important, both culturally and financially. The New York Observer called The Tonight Show, now in its 50th year, \"the most important slot in showbusiness\" - a fact acknowledged even by would-be presidents who regularly include it in their schedules. Last season, The Tonight Show generated $220m in revenues for NBC and about $150m in profit. Although the viewing figures are relatively small, they attract the kind of young male audience that advertisers are desperate to reach. Leno gets paid $17m a year. So what lies behind the nascent fightback? The announcement in September that Leno would be leaving to make way for Conan O'Brien might have turned some viewers off. Letterman, no fan of Leno's since they fought bitterly to replace Johnny Carson as The Tonight Show host, made fun of the announcement, describing his rival as \"a lame duck\" presenter. There might be some truth in this. O'Brien's ascendancy represents a changing style in comedy. A former writer on The Simpsons, he is edgier than nice-guy Leno. NBC's announcement that he would be the new host could be interpreted as an admission that Leno's act is getting tired. Letterman's return to ratings form, though, is probably more easily explained. CBS has passed NBC in primetime this season to nab first place. On Mondays at 10pm it has scheduled CSI Miami, the Florida spin-off of the network's popular forensics drama. At the same time, NBC has lost many of its favourites throughout the week, including Friends and Frasier. It could simply be that Letterman is getting more promotion and a better lead-in. Britain's own Craig Ferguson will be hoping that Letterman's comeback continues. Ferguson was last week named to replace Craig Kilborn on The Late Late Show, which follows Letterman on CBS. He will be looking for a similar boost. David Teather in New York Radio Cash boost for gay station With digital radios flying off the shelves in the run-up to Christmas, stations that broadcast exclusively on the new medium are gearing up for expansion. One such station is Gaydar Radio, which launched three years ago as one of a burgeoning number of niche services broadcasting over the internet. Its popularity grew off the back of the success of the Gaydar website, a dating service that launched five years ago and now has more than 2.2 million subscribers. Earlier this year it took over the digital radio spectrum of struggling rival Purple Radio, broadcasting to London and the south-east. It also continues to broadcast over the internet and on Sky Digital. Last week, holding company Q Soft Consulting announced a \u00a31.5m investment in the station, which is aimed at a mixed gay audience but attracts a 90% upmarket, male listenership. It plans to use the increased funding to move to new studios, bid for more licences and open up its own sales arm. Jamie Crick, who runs the programming side of the station as well as presenting an afternoon show and an early morning programme on Classic FM, said the goal was to widen the reach of the station.
