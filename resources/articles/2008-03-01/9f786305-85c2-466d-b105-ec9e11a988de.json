You might even think it sounds idyllic. Well, let me tell you: it was horrible. Here is my cautionary tale. It's October and my thoughts turn, as they do each year, to finding a way to stop us from going skiing. I don't like skiing. I especially don't like what it does to my wife, Elaine. She becomes a different person. A frightening, over-daring side of her comes out. She bombs down black runs like a lunatic. It's like The Devil In Miss Jones but with skiing instead of sex. Last year she crashed straight into a ski school full of children. My son Joel and I watch her climb into the chair lift and give each other sad, scared looks that say, \"It's surely only a matter of time before she skis off a cliff and dies.\" So I try to find ways for us not to go skiing, although I'm resigned to the fact that we'll have to do something in snow. And then I have a brilliant idea. An overnight husky safari! It'll give Elaine all her skiing kicks (sliding in snow, etc), but the huskies will be in charge and they know what they're doing, so we'll be less likely to die. \"Plus,\" I think, \"it'll be nice to have dogs do something for me for a change. Usually, with dogs, I do all the work, throwing sticks, etc. I like the idea of them pulling me up a hill. It'll be an adventure but I won't have to exert myself. I'll just be standing there on a sled.\" The travel company says it has a great husky safari in Norway. I furrow my brow. \"Norway?\" I think. I have a saying when it comes to Scandinavian holidays: \"Norway? No way.\" My antipathy stems from a skiing holiday we had five years ago in Trysil. We paid a supplement to hear traditional Norse tales in front of a bonfire in the snowy wilderness. The bonfire turned out to be in the car park of a plastics factory. Snow or no snow, it was an industrial estate. They are a no-nonsense people, the Norwegians, and I like a bit of nonsense when I'm on holiday. But this time, the travel company promises, we'll be husky sledding through genuine wilderness, setting off from a tiny village called Bjorli on the edge of a vast, scarcely populated mountain range. We'll each get to drive our own sled, each pulled by five dogs, except Joel who'll sit in Kurt the guide's sled. We'll spend the night in a Norwegian government cabin on the banks of a frozen lake, then sled back to Bjorli the next morning. \"Sounds nice,\" I think, without really thinking about it. We arrive in Bjorli on New Year's Eve. The receptionist at the lovely Bjorligard Hotel says we're just in time for their traditional midnight firework display up at the ski slopes. She gives us each a flaming torch and tells us to follow the others. And so we do. We follow the villagers down a path and through a petrol station. \"Surely it's a bit dangerous to carry flaming torches through a petrol station,\" I think. We reach the ski slopes. It turns out that in Norway everyone brings their own fireworks to firework displays and lets them off wherever they like. They basically aim them at each other's faces. We Brits are always complaining about how Health &amp; Safety has ruined everyone's fun, but try visiting a Norwegian firework display. It's terrifying. It's like being in a war. I spend the whole night like a coiled spring, ready to take a bullet for Joel. But it's quite exciting, too. The next day is our free day and so, my teeth gritted, we ski. Bjorli's slopes turn out to be really great. They are gentle and family-friendly. I've never been less worried on skis. We drink hot chocolate. We have snowball fights. We eat a delicious dinner at our hotel and visit their fantastic-looking Ice Hotel. That night I sleep fitfully. I toss and turn. I know nothing about tomorrow's overnight husky safari. I have a sense of foreboding. I put it down to the fact that I tend to have a sense of foreboding about everything. But in this instance, as it will soon transpire, my foreboding will be a genuine premonition of doom. It's Wednesday morning. Kurt, our husky guide, meets us at 10.30am. He seems nice: young and eager. Marcus, the Guardian photographer, and his Norwegian wife, KP, join us. The six of us wander down to Kurt's kennels. \"OK!\" says Kurt. \"Everybody hand your mobile phone to me! You cannot have a proper adventure if you have your mobile phone with you! Come on, everyone! Hand them over!\" Marcus and KP and Elaine excitedly hand him their phones. Then they all look eagerly at me. \"Surely this is unnecessary,\" I think. \"I'm perfectly capable of having an adventure with a phone. Plus, I thought the dogs would be all harnessed up and raring to go, but they aren't. They're still chained to their kennels. Shouldn't Kurt be harnessing the dogs instead of setting the parameters of how I will or won't enjoy my adventure?\" I hand him my phone. I am no expert in dog harnessing, but I have to say Kurt seems to be faffing around a bit. He keeps disappearing off to his house up the hill to retrieve more ropes and clasps. He makes three trips up there. Consequently, three and a half hours pass and we're still standing at the kennels. It's going to get dark in a couple of hours and our cabin - although we don't yet know it - is 40km away. \"OK,\" Kurt says, finally, at 2pm. \"We are ready!\" And we set off. At first it's lots of fun. It's really great. The huskies dash excitedly along cross-country ski runs, tossing us thrillingly around. I...#8239;whoop with joy. I can see Joel up ahead in Kurt's sled. He gives me the thumbs up. Kurt takes a turning off-piste. Now we get bashed around in a forest. I keep getting whiplashed by trees. \"This part isn't as much fun!\" I yell to Marcus the gung-ho photographer who's driving the sled behind me. (Marcus spends a lot of time in the wilderness and in war zones.) \"It's the nature of the countryside,\" Marcus yells back. \"This isn't a city park, you know.\" \"I knew at some point someone would make a little comment about me not being as wildernessy as them,\" I think sullenly. And then, suddenly, night falls. So now we're sledding through the darkness - for hours. This isn't any fun at all. We're cold and tired. It's night-time. I want to be by a fire eating reindeer soup, or whatever treat Kurt has planned for us up at the cabin. \"Don't worry!\" Kurt yells. \"We just have to go across this frozen lake - another 15km - and we're there!\" \"I'm glad because I've frankly had enough,\" I think. Time and now-unpleasant sledding passes. I think we're on the frozen lake Kurt mentioned, but I don't know because I can't see anything. We go around in circles for a bit. And then - suddenly, and with a stomach-churning finality - we stop. And that's when the dogs start barking. \"Kurt?\" I shout. \"Bark bark bark bark!\" yell the dogs. \"Are we lost?\" I shout. \"Bark bark bark bark!\" yell the dogs. \"I'm coming over to talk to you!\" I shout. \"Don't leave your sled!\" yells Kurt. \"If you do the dogs might run away! Whatever you do, stay where you are!\" \"Bark bark bark bark!\" yell the dogs. Here's something I didn't know about huskies: they might be gloriously silent when they run, but when they stop - especially when they're forced to stop, mid-run, because the humans are lost and confused in the dark - they bark. They bark and bark and bark. We are standing on a frozen lake in the freezing cold darkness, surrounded by 25 relentlessly barking dogs. \"Joel?\" I yell. \"Elaine? Are you all right?\" \"Bark bark bark bark!\" yell the dogs. \"Kurt, do you have a satellite phone?\" I yell. Then I add, sternly, \"Kurt, we've had enough now. Will you get us to the cabin or phone for a rescue team, please?\" \"Bark bark bark bark!\" yell the dogs. \"What's that blood?\" I think. There is blood everywhere. \"What's that blood?\" I yell. \"Bark bark bark bark!\" yell the dogs. \"Where is all that blood coming from?\" I think. \"Joel?\" I yell. \"Elaine?\" \"Bark bark bark bark!\" yell the dogs. I need information. I am a worrier at the best of times. I once, for instance, misdiagnosed Joel with premature ageing syndrome because a few people told me he looked old for his age, but deep down I knew I was just being neurotic. Now, though, the worst-case scenario is actually happening. My neuroses are factually accurate. We really are lost in the dark in the wilderness and it's minus 20 and I've got my son into this mess and he's probably frostbitten and perhaps even bleeding but I can't find out because I have to stay with my sled and the dogs are barking so loudly that nobody can talk to each other. More time passes. \"Kurt!\" I yell. \"Kurt! Kurt! Kurt!\" Finally, the dogs settle down. It turns out that the blood belongs to one of the dogs and not Joel. In the confusion two dogs had started fighting, and one has a head wound. Joel is OK, but he's very cold and frightened. \"I'm sure the cabin is over there somewhere,\" Kurt says, indicating an infinite expanse of darkness. \"I think Marcus and I should go off to look. Why don't you stay here, Jon, with the women and Joel?\" I pause. \"OK,\" I say. We watch as Marcus and Kurt vanish into the darkness. \"Are you scared?\" Elaine asks KP. \"When I feel scared,\" she replies, \"I look to Marcus. If Marcus isn't scared, I'm not scared.\" There's a silence. \"Jon's always scared,\" says Elaine. I am scared. Kurt has brought no satellite phone, no compass and no light besides two tiny torches. He's got six Pot Noodles and a bar of chocolate, and that's our only food. He's brought sleeping bags but no tents. I want my wilderness guides to be, well, mystical. I want them to have special survival powers, etc. If Kurt and Marcus can't find the cabin, I think we're in trouble. Half an hour passes. Then we hear voices. \"Did you find the cabin?\" we yell though the darkness. \"No,\" Kurt yells back. \"But we found a cabin.\" Breaking into a cabin lifts all our spirits. It turns out to be very exciting to smash through the pane of glass and climb into someone else's house through the window. I can see why thieves want to do it. It's fab. It's a nice, homely, two-bedroom cabin. It belongs to someone called Ottar Tryggest. I don't want to have too much of a poke around his belongings - it seems like a bit of an invasion of his privacy - but I can't help investigating a bit. Ottar Tryggest is a keen birdwatcher. He comes here during the summer months and writes down what he sees. He rents the cabin out, too, which makes us all feel a bit less guilty about breaking in. Joel is much cheerier now. \"This is giving me about three weeks' worth of show and tells,\" he says. By now it's gone nine. Kurt gets a fire started in the stove. Unfortunately the chimney is blocked with snow and so the cabin instantly fills with thick black smoke. We all start coughing and scramble out of the...#8239;window again, but it's just teething trouble. Kurt gets on to the roof, unblocks the chimney, and we are safe. There's a guest book. While we warm up by the fire, Kurt writes in it. \"Are you OK?\" I ask him. \"Yes, of course,\" he replies, a little sharply. \"Why would I not be OK?\" I'm finding Kurt's reluctance to admit that anything bad has happened a bit annoying. He got us hopelessly lost, he had no emergency supplies, and I wish he'd be a bit more contrite. Later, KP reads what he's written in the guest book. It's heartbreaking. He pours his heart out. He tells Ottar Tryggest that he takes full responsibility for what has happened. He says he let everyone down and he feels just awful about it. He says he's really sorry. The cabin has no toilet. There's a padlocked outside toilet, but we feel we've broken into enough things tonight, so we leave it alone. There's also no toilet paper. The only paper we've brought is my notepad, filled with my pithy, clever thoughts. With enormous magnanimity, I sacrifice it to the greater good, but it breaks my heart to watch a stream of people climb outside into the snow to wipe their bottoms on my notes. \"I bet when we wake up tomorrow morning,\" I say, \"we will see that the lake is surrounded by millions of cabins. There's probably a five-star hotel here.\" The next morning, we wake up to discover that we are, in fact, in the midst of a freezing, desolate wilderness. The only other cabin in sight is the one we were supposed to have stayed in. It's right next door. It's 7pm, the next evening, back in the warm, safe Bjorligard Hotel. I'm sitting at the bar when Kurt wanders in. \"Oh, hi,\" he says, matter-of-factly. \"Oh, hi,\" I say. There's a silence. \"How are you?\" I ask. \"Fine,\" he says. It's a weirdly cool exchange. I imagine that, sometimes, lifelong friendships occur between strangers who have been in peril together out in the wilderness. But that's not Kurt and me. Kurt's too embarrassed and I'm too annoyed with him. Instead, I sit by myself and drink an Irish coffee. And I ask myself, now that it's all over, do I have any regrets? Yes. I have lots of regrets. I massively wish we hadn't gone. Was any of it exciting? Well, I suppose that breaking into the cabin was exciting. And I will say this: life seems to have been zooming by pretty fast of late. The years are whooshing by. But life slowed down a lot that night. Every hour seemed like a day. And that's good. The story has a happy ending. A week later I receive an email from Kurt: \"I spoke to the owner of the cabin,\" he writes. \"He turned out to be a really nice man and thought we did the right thing under the circumstances. He said we're the third group to break into his cabin in 30 years. But as far as he knows nobody has ever broken in with his own reporter and photographer before.\" Kurt is going back there next weekend to fix the damage and put in a new window. \u0095 Jon Ronson travelled with The Mighty Fine Company (mightyfinecompany.com) To organise a tailor-made holiday, call 0845 072 0090 or email ask@mightyfinecompany.com Five other family adventures Camping in an Andaluc\u00edan yurt Imagine a small cluster of yurts, nestled deep in an Andaluc\u00edan valley.
