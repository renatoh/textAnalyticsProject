The nationalisers think they're back in fashion, and that full-scale nationalisation is the answer to whatever the question is, as though public ownership by itself alone offered a solution to everything. The private marketers think once the current glitch is over, it's back to business as usual. Both these extreme responses are absurd. But the current breakdown does prompt a serious re-think of what new model is now needed \u2013 not an ideological ultimatum, but a hard-headed look at where the balance between the public and private sectors should now be drawn so as best to redress the problems that have been exposed. The problems in banking have been revealed to be a flocking into worthless financial derivatives (because they were thought to offer super-profits), a readiness for speculative trading rather than lending to businesses and individuals, a growing shift to offshore operations to reduce transparency and tax, and a resort to massive bonuses which promoted recklessness rather than innovation and dynamism in banks' proper functions. They also extensively promoted mortgage lending to a huge number of low-income households who could obviously never afford it \u2013 the UK's very own sub-prime market scandal. There is clearly a very strong case for at least one publicly-owned bank as an exemplar to transform the whole ethos of banking practices which have now become seriously corrupted, quite likely beyond the reach even of tighter regulation. Moreover, when the government (or at least Mandelson) is thinking of part-privatisation of the Post Office, there is also a strong case for pursuing the opposite course of re-establishing a new Girobank and bolstering the Post Office Card Account within the Royal Mail. The former would provide universal access to banking which the private sector never will. Britain has only 180 bank branches per million inhabitants, against triple that number in France, Germany and Italy and five times that number in Spain. The fashion for outsourcing transport contracts to the private sector also needs to be reviewed. Several rail accidents (including the Clapham train disaster) have been traced back to faulty work passed down the line to over-stressed contractors forced to work too long or to loss of managerial control through myriad sub-contracting. Notorious losses of highly sensitive IT data (including two CDs containing a mass of personalised data about half the entire population) as well as large passport batches have been due to private couriers. Bringing this work back under more secure public sector procedures could save substantial costs as well as political embarrassment. In pharmaceuticals the need for a public sector comparator becomes clearer all the time. The recent dispute about whether people who buy very expensive drugs privately should then have to pay for the rest of their NHS treatment misses the key point, as the chairman of Nice pointed out, that many drugs are far too costly. Regulation will never get close enough to the inner workings of pharmaceutical companies to be an effective constraint on excess profiteering. One or two publicly-owned drugs companies could make huge savings for the NHS. The government's prejudice against council housing (even in Thatcher's last year 13,000 council houses were built, compared to only 100 a couple of years ago) has crucified hundreds of thousands on ballooning council waiting lists which have now reached 1.7 million in addition to nearly 100,000 homeless. The private sector, whether through home ownership or renting, will never get anywhere near providing decent housing for the poorest quarter of the population. Why resist the obvious solution of good-quality publicly-provided social housing, not least when this offers the best counter-cyclical measure in an economic downturn? Ideological fixation in favour of throwing private markets at every problem must now give way to more commonsense solutions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
