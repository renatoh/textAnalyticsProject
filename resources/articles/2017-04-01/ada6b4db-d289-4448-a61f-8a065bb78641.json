Trophies bought rather than earned, plastic achievements from a club with no history. The most vehement taunts have come from Liverpool supporters whenever they have visited Stamford Bridge during the past decade or so and you just have to look at the banners hailing Chelsea\u2019s past heroes that have slowly but surely taken residence at the stadium during that time to know it has had an effect. As such, it was impossible for the attention not to be grabbed by Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s choice of words as he assessed Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s progress since they lost against Chelsea in the 2015 Capital One Cup final, before they face their London rivals at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. Pochettino\u2019s English is not the best, but neither is he a fool. His response seemed calculated. An early shot fired from an emboldened manager. \u201cI think our answer [to losing in 2015, as well as seeing Chelsea end Spurs\u2019 title hopes last season] is fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you analyse where we came from, it\u2019s a fantastic time for Tottenham. Tottenham is not building in an artificial way. It is not about putting in money, money, money and build a fantastic team. Tottenham is genuine, a very natural process, and it is so exciting because it is unique in the world.\u201d Some of that is true, some of it is not. For sure this is a fantastic time for Tottenham, with the 4-0 victory against Bournemouth on Saturday making it 12 successive top-flight victories for Pochettino\u2019s men at White Hart Lane and further enhancing the view that even if they miss out on the title this season, Spurs have what it takes to win it in the near future. The home side were dominant and thrilling in equal measure, taking full advantage of opponents whose sloppiness suggested they arrived in the capital expecting to get beaten by a superior side. They were not mistaken. However, the suggestion that Tottenham\u2019s advancement since Pochettino arrived from Southampton in May 2014 has been unique and not propelled by spending is somewhat far-fetched. This, after all, is a club which has invested more than \u00a3170m on recruits in the past three years, with their outlay increasing season by season. Five of the players who started against Bournemouth were signed by the current regime, with six of the seven substitutes having also arrived on Pochettino\u2019s watch. What is for sure is that in comparison with Chelsea, Tottenham are positively thrifty. The leaders have invested close to \u00a3307m on players since May 2014, with their outlay since Abramovich landed his helicopter in London almost 14 summers ago topping \u00a31bn. Money has, of course, been brought in through sales, but sizeable and sustained spending has undeniably been the driving force behind Chelsea\u2019s rise since 2003. Some, like a certain Argentinian working close to the Seven Sisters Road, may even suggest it has been artificial. Whatever the accusations and antagonisms, Saturday\u2019s contest between the country\u2019s leading teams is shaping up to be a keenly fought and potentially epic affair, with Tottenham going into it with their collective chests well and truly puffed out. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big semi-final at the weekend and we\u2019re feeling as good as we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d said Harry Kane, whose goal against Bournemouth means he has become only the fourth player to score 20-plus goals in three consecutive Premier League seasons. \u201cMentally we\u2019re strong. We\u2019re feeling ruthless.\u201d With Tottenham now only four points behind Chelsea in the Premier League following their 2-0 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, Kane also feels that a win against Antonio Conte\u2019s side at Wembley could benefit Spurs in the closing stages of the title race. \u201cIt could be a big thing psychologically,\u201d said the 23-year-old. \u201cOf course it\u2019s a different competition so it\u2019s hard to say, but if we win it might put a bit more doubt in their minds regarding the Premier League.\u201d A victory would also allow Tottenham to put right their poor record at the national stadium. Including, semi-finals, finals and European fixtures, they have won just one of their past eight matches there. \u201cWe must make Wembley our home because next season it is sure we will play there,\u201d said Pochettino. \u201cThe last game we played there, against Gent, was unlucky because Dele Alli was sent off and we dominated. That was the moment to realise we can play in the same way that we play at White Hart Lane, and this is a good example we need to work on, knowing that feeling.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
