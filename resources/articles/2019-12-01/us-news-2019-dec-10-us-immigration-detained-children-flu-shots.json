Customs and Border Protection (CBP) refused to grant a group of doctors access to provide vaccines in San Diego on Monday despite at least three recent flu deaths of children in US immigration custody, aged two, six and 16, and growing concerns about health hazards and unsafe conditions for asylum seekers in detention. Licensed physicians arrived at the Chula Vista border patrol station in San Ysidro prepared to operate a free flu clinic for the detained migrants, but CBP would not let them inside, claiming it was not \u201cfeasible\u201d to provide the medical care. \u201cMore people will die without the vaccine,\u201d said Dr Hannah Janeway, an emergency medicine physician turned away by CBP. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt. They are being locked in cages in cold weather together, without any vaccination, in a year that is supposed to bring a horrible flu epidemic.\u201d Janeway, a Los Angeles-based doctor who also works with asylum seekers in Tijuana, said CBP had a moral obligation to provide vaccines: \u201cOur government, who is creating these conditions and allowing them to persist, is basically saying some people\u2019s lives are worth more than others, and it\u2019s OK for children to die.\u201d For more than a month, a group of physicians has been urging the US to vaccinate migrants in custody, and in November they formally offered to set up a free pilot clinic. CBP, however, has rejected the proposal by arguing that there are logistical challenges and that because CBP operates short-term detention, a flu clinic is not feasible. A CBP spokesman, Matthew Dyman, said in an email on Tuesday that individuals in the agency\u2019s custody \u201cshould generally not be held for longer than 72 hours\u201d, adding: \u201cEvery effort is made to hold detainees for the minimum amount of time required.\u201d Dyman said CBP did not administer vaccines but was \u201cpart of a larger system that has these processes in place\u201d, noting that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), which operates long-term detention, has \u201ccomprehensive medical support services\u201d. Government records, however, have shown that children and adults have been held in CBP custody in crowded conditions for longer than 72 hours, and lawyers representing migrants in the region have reported clients being held for weeks with little explanation. Asked about vaccines on Monday, CBP\u2019s commissioner, Mark Morgan, told reporters he was \u201cnot a medical expert\u201d but that CBP was \u201ctaking a hard look\u201d at the issue to determine \u201cwhat makes the most sense\u201d. A Department of Homeland security spokesperson criticized the doctors in a tweet on Tuesday, saying: \u201cOf course Border Patrol isn\u2019t going to let a random group of radical political activists show up and start injecting people with drugs.\u201d Doctors argued that regardless of the length of detention, CBP should be providing life-saving services, noting that it would be efficient and free for the group of volunteers to administer vaccines. \u201cWe see this as medical negligence on the part of the US government,\u201d said Dr Bonnie Arzuaga, co-founder of Doctors for Camp Closure, one of the groups offering services. \u201cPeople are being held in close confinement and usually are under a lot of physical and emotional stress \u2026 and may be malnourished and may not have access to hygiene supplies. That puts them at risk.\u201d Arzuaga said the group of roughly 60 doctors and advocates were ready with 120 doses of the vaccine on Monday and prepared to operate an urgent mobile clinic. She estimated it could have taken as little as 30 minutes to complete the entire process. \u201cAll they really needed to do was open the gate,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be on the other side of the fence with all the resources we had available to us and to not be able to share those resources with the people who needed it most felt frustrating and disappointing.\u201d On Tuesday, the groups visited the San Diego border patrol headquarters to demand a meeting with officials. Some demonstrators blocked an entrance to the facility and lay on the ground, with six people ultimately arrested. Four of the people detained were doctors, according to organizers, and they were cited for \u201cfailure to comply with the lawful directions of a federal police officer\u201d before being released. Danielle Deines, a neonatologist working with the group, said she was able to speak with several local CBP officials on Monday who continued to express resistance. \u201cThey are having difficulty prioritizing something like this, because they have so far dehumanized people,\u201d she said, adding that one CBP official said something along the lines of: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s not like we can offer the flu vaccine to every Central American who comes knocking on our door.\u2019\u201d \u201cMy question is, why not?\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to hold people in detention, you can provide people the basic flu vaccine \u2026 You\u2019re saying death is acceptable to you, and that you don\u2019t value human life.\u201d A number of Trump administration anti-immigration policies have created what lawyers say is a humanitarian crisis at the border, and migrants in detention have reported difficulties taking care of basic hygiene and medical needs. At least six migrant youths have died in immigration custody or shortly after their release. \u201cAs medical professionals, we deem this an emergency,\u201d said Deines, who is based in Virginia. \u201cIt is our duty to help them and stand up for them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
