But that is the fate of pizza: in the right hands, the food of the gods, but also a global comfort food \u2013 so much so that technologists have spent years trying to find a way of getting an approximation of it into soldiers' ration packs. It is a tough ask: the right dough, the right heat, the right topping, all converted into something that can be stored for weeks at a time and emerge edible at the end of it. But, just as they prepare to pull out of Afghanistan, word comes that this new scientific milestone has been achieved.
