Sir Bernard wishes us to point out that this is not so. As does Pat Crick, Michael's mother, who assures us that his father is John Crick, a retired FE lecturer. When Conservative party official Vanessa Gearson warned colleagues that Betsy Duncan Smith's \u00a318,000 payment for work in her husband's office might trigger a \"Crick-style investigation\" she must have sent tremors through party HQ. Michael Crick, the son of Bernard Crick, the political philosopher and author of In Defence of Politics, is a formidable investigative reporter. He combines working on BBC2's Newsnight with producing well-regarded books. Among them are a book on the miners' strike, a biography of Michael Heseltine, and Stranger Than Fiction, an investigation of Jeffrey Archer's extraordinary career that revealed for the first time details now widely known, both creditable and deplorable. In true Crick style, the simmering dispute over Mrs Duncan Smith's role has taken months of quiet work to reach the front pages. His proposed investigation would have appeared on BBC Newsnight ahead of last week's Tory conference. But Tory lawyers threatened legal action. BBC chiefs, bruised by the Hutton inquiry, backed down. Predictably the story leaked again - into last week's Sunday Telegraph. Picked up by other papers, it set the disastrous tone for the Blackpool conference."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
