But this year is different. With homemade all the rage, and saving money high on most people's Christmas lists, I'm having a go at a frugal yet festive confection that anyone can knock up. I'm not a great baker \u2013 my biscuits rise higher than my cakes ever have \u2013 so I sought help from Sarah Randell, food director of Sainsbury's Magazine, who recommended Dan Lepard's easy maple Christmas cake as an alternative to the traditional number. It still has the dried fruit, nuts and booze you might expect, but is a little lighter on the stomach and the wallet. Made with top-end ingredients it could set you back just under \u00a312, but with a few cost-cutting moves you can take that under a tenner. \"As Christmas cake has lots of spice and there are lots of complex flavours, you can get away with using cheaper ingredients,\" says Randell. She puts the cost of using Sainsbury's Basics ingredients at \u00a39.95; using Mysupermarket to find the best prices I estimate you can do it for less than \u00a38. One of the problems with buying things specially for a recipe is that you often end up with more than you need. So, before you go shopping see if you have anything left in the cupboard from your last baking session. The good news is that it doesn't need to match the recipe completely. Randell says it's fine to use caster sugar instead of soft brown sugar or to switch golden syrup or honey for the maple syrup (and having tasted the finished article I can say I didn't notice the maple). You can also use baking powder instead of bicarbonate of soda\u2013 because the cake is quite acidic you don't need the cream of tartar that's in baking powder, but no harm will be done if it is there.. And if you don't want to buy orange extract, you can use fresh orange zest. \"I do think you want some alcohol in it to make it a Christmas cake, but a lot of people have a bit of something in their cupboards,\" says Randell. If you have to buy something specially, buy a miniature, rather than a large bottle. \"The proportions have to be the same in order for the cake to work, but other than that, people can use what they have,\" she says. Randell suggests cooking with a friend to cut costs. You can buy the ingredients between you, and you can save energy costs by cooking both cakes in one oven \u2013 you may need to leave them in there slightly longer, but nowhere near twice as long. To make the cake go further, use a square tin rather than a round one \u2013 this makes it easier to eke out lots of slices. For someone who takes fright at the sight of a recipe with more than six steps, this one is pleasingly easy. It's pretty much a matter of throwing everything in a bowl and stirring. Because we are using Basics flour, this does have to be sifted, but leaving the cherries and almonds unchopped makes things easier, and I think makes the cake feel more luxurious. Once the ingredients are combined, it's into a lined tin and into the oven for an hour-and-a-half. Today is stir-up Sunday when, traditionally, Christmas cakes are made. Because this one is lighter on fruit and alcohol it won't last, but if you want to make it now so you have one less job to do in December it will freeze well (just don't ice it yet). Randell reckons this recipe could produce 24 slices \u2013 it's certainly done a few tea breaks in the office. Weighing in at 1.8kg it compares well cost-wise with ready-made supermarket versions \u2013 and the sense of achievement at tucking into something you've made yourself is priceless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
