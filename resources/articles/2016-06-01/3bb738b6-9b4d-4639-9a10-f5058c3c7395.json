Rather than deploring the owners\u2019 apparent lack of moral scruple, let us instead ask from where the sense of propriety that defines our current crop of business titans draws its strength. Modern economics teaches many things that are of dubious merit but the idea that shipbuilding, steel manufacture, high street retail or healthcare are just different forms of money-making is the most insidious. Until the Chicago school economic principles that define our culture are overturned then no amount of talk of corporate social responsibility will put things right. Dr William Dixon London Dr David Wilson Walton-on-the-Naze Essex The problem with BHS and other big businesses is the structure of company law that is based on allowing owners to do as they please with no legal duties to the interests of staff, suppliers or customers, provided this is approved by the AGM. So far as I understand it, owners are able to take capital out of the firm for their short-term advantage, even if this leaves the company with insufficient resources to invest in the future of the firm, provided the firm is not trading as insolvent. What is needed is a wholesale reform of company law, adopting the German model that places a duty on company owners to take into account the interests of staff and suppliers as well as customers. The German legal structure of staff \u2013 not necessarily trade union \u2013 representation on supervisory boards as well as on remuneration committees is long overdue. I see no evidence that such a reformed model of company law reduces either investment or long-term profitability. It would stop some owners of companies from taking short-term actions that take unacceptable risks with the long term viability of business. Jeremy Ross Ashtead Surrey It is perfectly possible that the outcome of the two Commons committees investigating BHS, just as with tax dodging in Panama, will be that nothing illegal has taken place. So the people \u201cwho can just walk on to yachts\u201d having taken \u201cmoney out of the business that wasn\u2019t there to be taken\u201d will simply continue to do so, while those \u201cwho have mortgages and shop at Asda\u201d will lose their jobs and be forced to accept reduced pensions, shedding light on why inequality is growing in the UK. David Murray Wallington Surrey Excellent leader on the BHS situation. The behaviour of both Green and Chappell has been appalling but the greatest worry is that the system has allowed them to get away with it. In my opinion, Philip Green should never have been given a knighthood. Last Sunday, I changed to the Observer, having read the Sunday Times for a number of years. A good choice it seems from my first read. Christine Williams Swansea"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
