But, a trio of game developers want to point out that thoughts and prayers are no match for assault rifles like the AR-15, which critics have called the weapon of choice for terrorists and mass murderers. Players of the developers\u2019 online game Thoughts &amp; Prayers are invited to try and stop a sequence of mass shootings popping up around the country by either pressing \u201cT\u201d to think or \u201cP\u201d to pray. It\u2019s a futile endeavor where, no matter how many thoughts and prayers are sent, no lives are saved. There\u2019s a third button that pops up part-way through the game which reads \u201cban assault weapon sales\u201d, but it triggers a message saying you are \u201cun-American\u201d, \u201cweak\u201d or you are getting too much campaign funding from the NRA to do that. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen enough gun violence. Everyone gives out the same message and it\u2019s got to the point of complete ridiculousness. Politicians are skirting taking action,\u201d explains Brian Moore, who created the game with Mike Lacher and Will Herring. The three developers built the game in around six hours and published it on Friday. Since then more than 310,000 people have played the game, Moore says. Many of those plays came via a forum for supporters of the AR-15 assault rifle. Moore decided to join the forum and introduce himself as the game\u2019s creator. He was greeted with widespread derision. \u201cHow hard were you dropped on your head?\u201d asked one forum member. Another asks where the button is \u201cfor a concealed carrier to shoot\u201d him. Moore isn\u2019t fazed by the reaction. \u201cMass shootings are at an all-time high. We love the idea of people having a debate over this,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important topic to cover and some sort of action needs to be taken.\u201d Thoughts &amp; Prayers is one of several games that Moore, Lacher and Herring have created under the banner of GOP Arcade, described as \u201can on-going series of lightweight games, designed to make all the hoopla surrounding the election slightly more enjoyable\u201d. Other games include Trump Toss, where you fling Mexicans over a wall to \u201cmake America great again\u201d\u2019, and Good Guy With a Gun, where you sell guns to \u201cgood guys\u201d while trying to avoid selling them to \u201cbad guys\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
