Mr Milburn's proposal to stamp out antisocial behaviour by hitting culprits where it hurts most, comes in a thinly veiled warning that the party is in danger of losing its way. \"Six years into government, in an age of deep public cynicism, the government's renewal depends on pursuing policies that are shaped by common belief. Otherwise, politics becomes soulless and without purpose,\" Mr Milburn boldly writes in the Independent. \"And policies take on the feel of a Jackson Pollock painting - all splashes of colour but no defining theme.\" New Labour has a \"huge opportunity\" to build on the opposition's current disarray, Mr Milburn writes. He described the Conservatives' radical proposals for education vouchers and healthcare shopping as resting on a fault line, with tax cutting and free market aspirations on the one hand, and an instinct for appealing to vote-winning \"compassion\" on the other. New Labour must not indulge in \"lazy complacency\" , but seize on this \"confusion\" to regain political momentum and realise Tony Blair's decisive shift to conviction politics, said Mr Milburn, who earlier this month ruled himself out of a return to frontline politics for the next three years. He pins this to the core Labour aim of achieving social justice, by moving beyond public service reform to reclaiming the streets and making them safe. \"People will not feel better if improved schools and hospitals are merely little islands of modernity in a sea of grubbiness,\" he writes. Praising the home secretary David Blunkett's recent moves to tackle low level crime such as vandalism and begging, Mr Milburn said the government must go further, by making benefits conditional on individuals' conduct. \"We should reform housing benefit to make receipt of it by landlords conditional on the behaviour of their tenants,\" he says. \"If necessary, such conditionality should apply to other benefits. Rewards should be offered to councils that evict antisocial neighbours. And there should be a concerted preventative programme to build on the success of Sure Start and the investment going in to drugs treatments.\" This would include more street wardens working alongside police to help \"recapture the streets\". All this will allow the party to expose the \"smaller state\" solution of the Tories as inadequate. \"Clean, crime-free streets should not just be for those who can afford to shelter behind security fences,\" he writes. \"Reclaiming the streets cannot be left to the individual. It can only happen when families, communities, local agencies and government act together.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
