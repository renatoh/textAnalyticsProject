However tired they are of the old man, it is pretty certain, too, that Robert Mugabe will remain on top of the pile, outmanoeuvring pretenders within his party and rivals outside it. Age has done little to soften the man. And neither has the evident disquiet of his neighbours. The Southern African Development Community, and the African Union, both of whom wanted the rushed elections in Zimbabwe to be postponed, continue to be outwitted by the 89-year-old, unable to pursue a reform agenda before elections, or to ensure a fair election when the day arrives. So it should come as little surprise that Morgan Tsvangirai, Mugabe's main challenger, dismissed Wednesday's poll as a farce, alleging gross irregularities. These included an electoral roll stuffed with 2 million invalid names, including many dead souls, while excluding up to 1 million live ones; renewed intimidation in rural areas; and Zanu-PF hands bussed into Harare to make up the numbers. It may have been peaceful \u2013 so far \u2013 compared with 2008, when more than 200 people died. But, if the largest independent observer group is to be believed when it says that one fifth of all Zimbabweans of voting age were disenfranchised by voter registration, it cannot have been fair. Much has changed since the dark days of economic collapse. Food is back on the shelves. Schools and hospitals have reopened, power cuts are fewer and even the tobacco farms are showing signs of recovery. The economy is growing again. A middle class made destitute four years ago has been restored. Much of that is due to a coalition government, which includes the very people, like finance minister Tendai Biti, who are now alleging widescale election fraud. Power sharing has not been an unalloyed success for the image of Mr Tsvangirai. In a country where millions live on just $2 a day, he has been accused of succumbing to the good life, his private life the subject of scrutiny. His party has lost popularity and Zanu-PF has increased its. For all that, Tsvangirai, a dogged survivor, remains the only national alternative to Mugabe outside Zanu-PF. The campaign has been as notable for the skirmishing inside Zanu-PF between rival factions controlled by the defence minister Emmerson Mnangagwa and vice-president Joice Mujuru. Each is fighting for the role of heir apparent. The SADC and the AU should now think hard about endorsing the result when it is announced and call for a rerun of the elections in three months' time. In the meantime, the coalition government should continue. Mugabe's last stand? It looks much like all the others."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
