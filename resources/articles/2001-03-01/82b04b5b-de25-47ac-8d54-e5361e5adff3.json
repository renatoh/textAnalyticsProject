Key elements are: \u0095 An end to the last long-stay hospitals. \u0095 A five-year programme to modernise local council day services. \u0095 A new national learning disability information centre and helpline in conjunction with charity Mencap. \u0095 A national forum for people with learning disabilities. \u0095 A learning disability task force. \u0095 Specialist local services for people with severe and challenging behaviour and integrated facilities for children with severe disabilities and complex needs. \u0095 An extension of eligibility to \"directs payments\", a scheme which allows service users to choose and purchase their own care. New funds promised are: \u0095 A learning disability development fund of up to \u00a3100m over the next two years. This will be spent on modernising day centres, helping people move from long-stay hospitals to more appropriate accommodation in the community, developing specialist local services for adults with severe, challenging behaviour as well as integrated facilities for children with severe disabilities and complex needs. \u0095 An implementation support fund, worth \u00a36m over three years, to fund new advocacy services as well as the learning disability information centre and helpline. \u0095 Extra funds are also promised for self-advocacy organisations. For the first time, national objectives will be established for quality and performance monitoring of learning disabilities services. These objectives aim to provide clear direction for local agencies. They will be backed up by new targets and performance indicators. A new qualification route for care workers is also to be established, through a learning disability awards framework."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
