So I look upon it as my very own private tragedy that I will be celebrating the joys of Christmas in a house without a telly. But you will be watching, won't you? Please tell me what you think. My colleague Gareth McLean has very entertainingly trawled through the Christmas schedule to present his thoughts on the festive offerings. He likes: Crooked House, Doctor Who, Stanley Baxter. He doesn't like: Wallace and Gromit, Caught in a Trap or Gavin and Stacey. I'm sure I'll disagree with most of his comments \u2013 it's just easier that way. But then again that will only occur if I get to see any of the programmes \u2013 doubtful at this stage. Doubtless I will be hunched over my brother's office laptop watching the Doctor Who Christmas special on the iPlayer as soon as it is uploaded. I am also particularly keen to see the Royle Family Christmas special, and the documentaries on Stanley Baxter and Blackadder. And I love The 39 Steps, both as a film and as a stage play, but will the BBC go a step too far with its James Bond remake starring Rupert Penry-Jones? We shall see by Sunday. I'll be home by then and able to read all your views. Don't hold back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
