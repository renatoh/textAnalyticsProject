Bass-baritones are especially bad. So it's no surprise to find Bryn Terfel recording a disc of the nasty pieces of work he's so accomplished at portraying; still less to have him do a villains' tour. These cameo glimpses of roles for which he is acclaimed are tightly focused, every word perfectly articulated: Iago from Verdi's Otello, is cruelly calculating, M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s from Gounod's Faust is Satan personified, while, in the Te Deum from Puccini's Tosca, Terfel's Baron Scarpia, the corrupt chief of police, sounds gorgeous but is horribly menacing. Terfel's clever use of Sweeney Todd's cut-throat razor in the all-too-short Sondheim extract, and of the knife when playing Mack the Knife from Weill's Threepenny Opera, showed just how he layers his characterisations with vocal and psychological colour. Apart from a, well, vile bit of keyboard in the Weill, the young Sinfonia Cymru played stylishly under the baton of Gareth Jones, though we could have done with an intermezzo or two less from them, and a bad boy or two more from Terfel. Stealing un-ashamedly from tenor repertoire, Terfel delivered Sporting Life's It Ain't Necessarily So from Porgy and Bess with relish, and also Javert's Stars from Les Mis\u00e9rables. Even those for whom crossover is the work of the devil will smile here. At Nottingham Royal Concert Hall, tonight. Box office: 0115-989 5555. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
