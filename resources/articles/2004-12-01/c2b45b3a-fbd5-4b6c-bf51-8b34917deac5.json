The announcement by the London Evening Standard that it is to launch a mid-morning giveaway edition, known as Standard Lite, convinced critics that London's paper is on its way to oblivion, that the idea was both mad and disastrous, and that the editor is being pushed aside in favour of a rival. Spleen, rumour and guesswork are hardly unusual in Fleet Street tradition, but they obscure truth and analysis. If we are to make any sense of the Standard Lite initiative it is essential to put it in context. The overall newspaper market is in decline and nowhere has this been more obvious in the past quarter century than in the regional evening paper sector. Britain's highest-selling evenings - in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Wolverhampton - lost between 3-8% of their sale in the first six months of this year according to the official ABC statistics. The Standard's decline in the same period was just under 7%. Last month it managed a headline sale of 370,832, but that included more than 40,000 bulks. London is proving a particularly difficult city in which to sell papers. With the exception of the Times, every national title is suffering from a decline in the London market. The Sun's editor, Rebekah Wade, believes the Metro - published by the owner of the Standard and the Daily Mail, Lord Rothermere's Associated Newspapers - is strangling her paper. While no one at Associated wants to admit that the giveaway Metro has also harmed the Standard, it must have made some difference, none of it beneficial. A painful year of cost-cutting, redundancies and tight budgets has resulted in the paper returning, in the last quarter, to profit. But Rothermere and his Associated executives clearly did not see that as good enough. Unlike some rival companies, they are not prepared to manage decline and the mantra at the Kensington headquarters has become: \"Doing nothing is not an option.\" Hence the Standard Lite idea, a risky venture which could be described as blue sky thinking. Whether viewed as brave or foolish, it proves that Associated is both committed to print and willing to innovate. Again, seen in a wider context, this echoes the compact revolution. It would appear to be both an aggressive move - to pump up flagging sales by encouraging younger readers to try the Standard - and a defensive move to make it even more difficult for rivals to grab territory. Dummies were still being appraised last week though the editor, Veronica Wadley, is keen for the new edition to be on the streets some time later this week. There are logistical and technical difficulties in trying to publish a paper within a paper, because the 48-page Standard Lite will contain 12 pages of news in digest form which will be very different from what appears in the traditional Standard. There will be some TV and sport too, but the big focus will be on lifestyle and entertainment. It means that Standard journalists will have to prepare their normal four editions plus Standard Lite and, as one harassed senior executive told me: \"We're still at the bottom of what's proving to be a steep learning curve\". The whole enterprise is obviously experimental. Some 50,000 copies of the free edition will be given away by street-sellers in a relatively small area of central London, roughly bounded by the Circle line, for three hours from 11.30am onwards. No one at Associated, even those most in favour of the move, is certain what will happen. Will it erode the Standard's sale? Will it breed a something-for-nothing view of newspapers among the young, one of the persistent criticisms of all free titles, especially the Metro? Will it become so successful that Associated widens the circulation area and ends up printing as many Standard Lites as paid-for Standards? It is sure to prove expensive in terms of newsprint and distribution, with vendors being paid \u00a320 a day over the next six weeks to give it away and the need for Associated's circulation staff to monitor every outlet. Needless to say, some Standard journalists are bemused by the venture, but every change in every paper (in every office in every industry) is always rubbished at first. I recall sub-editors in the early 1980s who were convinced that computers would never catch on. Similarly, journalists like nothing better than to speculate about the supposed demise of their editor. As far as I can determine Wadley's position is not under threat from the Mail on Sunday's rambunctious executive editor, Martin Clarke, who has been seconded to help launch Standard Lite. Rumours of her departure appear to be as true as they were six months ago, the year before and the year she was appointed. Call it gossip lite. Scrooge lives and owns newspapers My article last week about lowly-paid journalists lacked that most essential ingredient: a case history. As I explained, people were prepared to tell me that they were suffering from poor pay and conditions but they would not go on the record for fear of losing their jobs. Similarly, some sympathetic editors, who believe their reporters and subs should be paid more, also spoke on an unattributable basis. I'm in the same position now, but I cannot overlook a couple of jaw-dropping stories that arrived by email last week. The people concerned wish to remain anonymous, but they have identified themselves to me and I feel I must share their experiences while concealing enough to protect them. The first case involved a graduate who started as a trainee on a weekly paper owned by Newsquest at a salary below \u00a312,000. After normal bills - rent, council tax, car fuel, food and clothes - he found his overdraft from his university days ballooning. He has now decided, despite what he calls \"a love for journalism\", to quit. The second involves the staff of Trinity-Mirror's papers in North Wales and the north west who have been told that they will not get their traditional, if pathetic, Christmas \"bonus\" - a \u00a310 bottle of alcohol - this year. Staff at the Chester Chronicle have protested after discovering that the company has decided to throw an unwanted party instead, for which they will be expected to pay a \u00a35 entrance fee. \u00b7 More examples please to roy.greenslade@theguardian.com Times overtakes Telegraph at last And so it has finally come to pass. Rupert Murdoch, the press magnate who set his heart on the Times surpassing the Daily Telegraph, has scored his first major goal. The latest official circulation figures reveal that the Times sold 504,568 copies a day during November at its full cover price while the Telegraph's full-price total is 500,214. Though this must be seen in the context of the Telegraph's continuing lead because of its 310,000 cheap-rate subscribers, it is a significant landmark. Murdoch can also celebrate the Times's sales surge since it went compact. Year on year it registered a 10% rise and it is the only paper to have improved its London sale in the past month. There have been some deserters, most of whom decided to take the Telegraph instead. But the figures suggest that only about 12,000 have made the switch. Two other notable factors have been the Times's TV advertisements and DVD giveaways on successive Saturdays. These undoubtedly helped boost sales and it is unlikely, given the usual Christmas circulation depression, that the Times will do so well this month. That said, the new year sales battle between the four serious titles is going to be fascinating. Will the Independent, which last month recorded its first fall in a year, be able to maintain its cocky compact success? Will more Times readers become disenchanted with their compact? When will the Guardian finally join the fray by introducing its Berliner-style format? Will the Telegraph's new management start spending money on promoting the paper and will they demand high-level editorial changes too? There is no denying that the Guardian has suffered worst so far in the compact revolution. Its latest sale, at 351,000, is more than 5% down on a year ago and its six-monthly average is slightly worse. But it would be foolish to spend promotional money before it publishes in a new shape. So its owners, the Scott Trust, must grit their teeth and hope that defecting readers will return to the fold in the future. With the compacts having enjoyed success in mid-week, next year will certainly see some of the Sunday titles adopting smaller formats. The Observer is bound to change along with the Guardian and Simon Kelner, the Independent's editor-in-chief, is committed to a tabloid-shaped Independent on Sunday. The Sunday Telegraph will stick to broadsheet because of its link to its daily stablemate. So the real mystery is the future of the Sunday Times. It has maintained a high circulation while its rivals have suffered so there cannot be a pressing need to go compact. Is somebody at Wapping - such as its editor, John Witherow - saying: if it ain't broke, don't fix it? Stars lose their shine on red-tops In 1980, the year after the launch of the Daily Star, the six mass-market newspapers recorded the following six-monthly averages: Sun - 3,837,215; Daily Mirror - 3,650,636; Daily Mail - 1,984,804; Daily Express - 2,325,099; Daily Star - 1,033,168; Daily Record - 729,364. Their total sale was 13,560,286. Last month's audited figures show falls for all but the Daily Mail, which has managed a 15.5% rise. The total (unbulked) sale for the six is 9,423,521. The so-called mass market has therefore fallen in 24 years by 30.5%. So a third of the buyers of popular newspapers have vanished. There has been a rise in the serious market but it doesn't come near making up for lost readers. Quite simply, the masses have given up on newsprint. The leading red-tops, the Daily Mirror and the Sun, are returning, month by month, historically low figures. The Mirror's is the worst since 1941. The Sun's is the worst since 1973. The Daily Record's is the worst since 1960. The Daily Star has started to fall backwards too. These papers, having sold their souls to celebrity, are surely paying the price for abandoning proper journalism. Indeed, one major reason for the Daily Mail defying the trend is the subtlety with which it has managed to incorporate celebrity material without sacrificing its commitment to proper journalism. However some may feel about its politics and its dodgy journalistic ethics, it is recognisable as a newspaper. It's time for the red-tops to get the celebrities out of their pages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
