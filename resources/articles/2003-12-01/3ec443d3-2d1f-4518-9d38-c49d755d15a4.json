But yesterday, in a part of the world where cricketers value brain as highly as brawn, he showed a bit of both to keep England in the third and decisive Test against Sri Lanka at the SSC. Flintoff lumbered to the crease amid the ruins of a top-order collapse. England had squandered Marcus Trescothick's raucous 70, slumping from 78 without loss to 139 for five. Forty overs later, Flintoff departed for a crucial 77 off 109 balls, and England were back in it. From a purely personal point of view, it was the most significant innings of his Test career. \"I was a bit nervous going out there after four low scores in the last two Tests,\" he said. \"I tried to trust my method, tried not to change too many things. I just tried to scrap that little bit harder. It was a fighting innings.\" It would not sit well with Flintoff to start using words like catharsis, but that is precisely how his innings felt. He would admit only that it was \"up there\" - modern jargon for \"I'm over the moon\" - but he was ignoring context. And, until yesterday, the context was miserable. In nine Test innings in India and Sri Lanka Flintoff had cobbled together 62 runs and had been out-thought by the spinners eight times. Here, at last, he made the transition from an easy wicket to thinking cricket, more than doubling his subcontinental tally in the process. The \"Runs in Asia\" chapter of a coffee-table photo book of Flintoff's career due next summer should now make more pleasant reading. \"Playing round here, with men round the bat and the ball spinning here, there and everywhere, the hardest part as a batsman is getting in. But once you get yourself in, you've got to get runs. I've tried to show aggression all through the series. It just hasn't really come off.\" Flintoff repeated time and again his claim that he had batted as he always does. But his words had a defensive ring to them, and the evidence, particularly against old Lancashire buddie Muttiah Muralitharan, was not quite so conclusive. In Galle and Kandy, Murali snared him three times. On two occasions Flintoff went back to big off-breaks and was trapped plumb in front; on the other he paid the price for over-aggression. Yesterday he played Murali as if he had learned his lessons, getting diligently forward to smother the spin and only going after the bad balls, of which there were approximately two. Murali eventually got his man - caught and bowled after a tame drive - but Flintoff's concentration against the trickiest spinner in the world surprised everyone - not least Murali himself. It was at the other end that Flintoff conformed to type, tucking into the leg-spin of Upul Chandana as if scattering tuk-tuk drivers loitering for a fare outside the stadium. Even amid the fireworks, there were signs that Flintoff was making a conscious effort not to self-combust. A flick-pull for six off Chaminda Vaas to bring up his fifty was followed by a forward defensive of such diligence that you half-expected him to look to the packed England balcony for a thumbs-up. On another - more carefree - day, Flintoff might have perished attempting something more murderous. But his promotion to No6 after the decision to leave out Paul Collingwood in favour of James Anderson was bringing out a steelier side. He played down his discipline against Murali: \"I can't change my game. I've got to keep trusting the way I play, trusting the method I've been working on with Mike Watkinson. Duncan [Fletcher] and Michael [Vaughan] back the way I play. It's just a case of modifying a couple of little things.\" This was about more than little things. It was about a big man taking a giant step towards self-respect in an environment that usually flummoxes him. For once, in these parts, it is his colleagues who are taking notes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
