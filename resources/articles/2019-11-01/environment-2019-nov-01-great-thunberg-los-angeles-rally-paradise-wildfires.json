Today the town with a lovely name is best known for the apocalyptic fire that ripped through it last year, decimating nearly every home and killing 86 people. This week California is once more in flames as fires rage in the north and south \u2013 a point that was not lost on the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who spoke at a rally in Los Angeles on Friday. \u201cWe can see the wildfires happening right around the corner,\u201d Thunberg said outside City Hall, just miles from an ongoing blaze. \u201cRight now we are living in the beginning of a climate and ecological breakdown, and we cannot look away from this crisis anymore.\u201d More than a thousand people joined Thunberg for an afternoon of youth-led environmental action, a scene that has become familiar as she \u2013 and young people like her \u2013 are increasingly frustrated with the inaction of their elders. \u201cThe older generations are failing us,\u201d she told the crowd, where organizers of the Youth Climate Strike were demanding that California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom impose an immediate moratorium on new oil and gas drilling. \u201cThey are failing future generations. But future generations do not have a voice. And the biosphere does not have a voice. So we will be the voice that speaks for them.\u201d Young people \u2013 especially young women \u2013 came out in force. Lily Olson, a 17-year-old high school senior from Los Angeles, said Thunberg was an inspiration to people of her generation, her existence a rejoinder to those who think the young should wait to speak out about their future. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see someone my age with such articulation and care and passion for what other people would consider \u2018not a big deal\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople seem to think because we\u2019re young we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about, or we don\u2019t have the ability to make change. But seeing someone like Greta speak about what she\u2019s truly passionate about \u2013 it really gives me faith in my generation.\u201d Morgan Wright, an 11-year-old from Burbank, attended Friday\u2019s rally with her mother. She too cited Greta as a role model. \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of her speeches and rallies in my history class,\u201d she said, noting that she had since helped start an eco-club to pressure her school to do more to protect the environment. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool to see someone that can go up there and talk, even though they\u2019re technically not an adult yet,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAnd they go up there and inspire people just like me.\u201d Casey Anell, 10, came from Huntington Park to attend the rally with her mother. She\u2019s been learning about climate change at school, and she too feels there is no more time for stalling. \u201cThere\u2019s a 50-50 chance the rainforest is going to be gone, and I\u2019m going to be sad,\u201d she said, and her classmates are frightened. \u201cThey\u2019re scared because they don\u2019t want any animals to go extinct,\u201d she explained. \u201cSome adults are doing something about it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know about the government.\u201d Though undoubtedly a star, Thunberg kept a low profile at the march. When young people began marching through the streets of downtown, she was not on the frontlines, where all the cameras were; she was just another marcher, somewhere in the back, melting into the anonymity of the crowd, rumors of her presence whispered by many who came to hear her speak. The limelight was ceded to local activists and their campaign: not just to address the global effects of the climate crisis, but the fact that Los Angeles remains a major producer of the very thing fueling it. Up to 8,000 barrels of oil are produced each day from wells in the city of Los Angeles, according to a July 2019 report from City Hall, and an estimated 1.6bn more barrels remain in the ground below. Over half a million people live within 2,500ft of an active oil or gas well, a number activists want reduced to zero. Not only does this production fuel the climate crisis, which in turn intensifies the fires now threatening the city, but the air pollution this drilling creates has itself increased rates of asthma and the risk of cancer among those living immediately next door \u2013 a majority of whom are members of low-income, minority communities. Nalleli Cobo, 18, has been campaigning against such drilling since she was 9 and growing up across the street from an oil well operating on land in South LA leased to a private firm, AllenCo, by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. \u201cAllowing this oil well to spew toxic emissions is another way the archdiocese is abusing children,\u201d she reminded Angelenos. \u201cIt is time to switch to clean, renewable energy. There is no more time to waste.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
