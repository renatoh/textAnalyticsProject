If the Massachusetts singer-songwriter \u2013 real name Claire Cottrill \u2013 is fazed by the adulation, then she doesn\u2019t let it show. From its opening note, her set appears precision-engineered to avoid undue fuss \u2013 more mood exercise than vehicle for grandstanding. The 21-year-old\u2019s stage setup is sparse: disconnected imagery \u2013 rolling clouds, raindrops on glass, worms \u2013 flashes across a blank backdrop, and she performs the songs from her debut, Immunity (which she co-produced with former Vampire Weekend member Rostam), beneath just a bare white bulb. It\u2019s daring, but they flourish under such scrutiny. Given her none-more-online rise to fame \u2013 precipitated by a home-recorded video for her song Pretty Girl blowing up on YouTube to the tune of 43m views and counting \u2013 it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that Cottrill\u2019s fanbase skews young. With a small asteroid belt of mums and dads ringing the room, a sometimes powerful exchange of emotional understanding plays out between artist and audience. Cottrill delivers her songs of hard-won lessons in a manner that\u2019s self-reflective, unvarnished and serious. Her first song, Alewife, is a paean to a friendship that helped mute her suicidal thoughts. When the crowd joins in, their voices barely rise above a collective whisper: \u201cYou know you saved me from doing something to myself that night.\u201d From the earliest thrashings of her career, Cottrill has faced barbs that generations of women in music have had to fend off. The allegation that she\u2019s an \u201cindustry plant\u201d who hasn\u2019t paid her dues might have originated on Reddit, but it\u2019s still rock snob 101. Stratocaster cinched about her shoulders as rolling blacktop flickers from the projector, her riposte is implicit and emphatic. Sofia, a jittery pop number on record, is recast with a rolling indie-rock gait by her nimble band, ending up sounding something like a supine Parquet Courts. Following a brief on-stage power cut, Cottrill kicks into a cathartic take on the hooky, lo-fi Bags without missing a beat. The screams start again. At O2 Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, 2 December. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
