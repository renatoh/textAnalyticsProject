Unless, of course, he betrayed his lack of managerial experience by calling up Mr Sheen, Fairy Liquid and Toilet Duck for the home friendly with Sweden on March 1. So there was really no surprise when the rosy-cheeked ruler named six uncapped players (although your ever-trusty FAI press release erroneously claimed it was seven) in the 23-man rabble he unveiled today - though eyebrows were certainly raised, along with many pairs of fingers, by his decision to extend Gary Breen's hapless international flouncing. Stan's starlets are Bolton handyman Joey O'Brien, Spurs sub Stephen Kelly, Reading revelation Kevin Doyle, Brighton goalkeeper Wayne Henderson, Manchester City midfielder Stephen Ireland and Liam Lawrence, one of the few candy-striped guinea pigs still unscathed by Mick McCarthy's ongoing Sunderland experiment. \"I've just gone with who I know for now,\" explained Stan, who is quite possibly a wonderful chap but is cursed with a monotonous Dundalk drawl that could bore its way to the Earth's core in 10 minutes flat. \"I wouldn't have them in the squad if they weren't in my thoughts for playing,\" he continued. \"I feel we have a right good blend of youth and experience.\" Lawrence qualifies for Ireland through his granny, which proves Stan wasn't joking (Stan tell a joke? good one!) when he said he'd fully exploit Fifa's ancestor rule. When Liverpool-born Swansea City showboater Lee Trundle heard that last month, he wailed: \"I've always wanted to play for Ireland!\" - but Stan today suggested the Republic aren't quite desperate enough to go dredging through League One. \"I've heard he's looking to move away [from Swansea] so the door isn't closed,\" drawled Stan, as his conspicuously absent sidekick Rir Sobby O'Bobson sat alone in a Reykjavik hotel room wondering why nobody else had turned up. Full squad: Given (Jongleurs FC), Kenny (Sheff Utd), Henderson (Brighton), Breen (Sunderland), Harte (Levante), Finnan (Liverpool), A O'Brien (Portsmouth), Dunne (Man City), Miller (Leeds), Kilbane (Everton), Reid (Blackeye Rovers), Duff (Chelsea), Keane (Tottenham), Morrison (Crystal Palace), O'Fiver (Fiver Towers), Kavanagh (Wigan), Doyle (Reading), Ireland (Man City), Elliott (Sunderland), Lawrence (Sunderland), J O'Brien (Bolton), Kelly (Tottenham), O'Shea (Man Utd), Douglas (Leeds). * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Good luck to Real Madrid. Let them enjoy the limelight we have enjoyed for the previous eight years. We are optimistic about our future revenue-generating expectations with the stadium expansion and the prospect of more lucrative sponsorship deals\" - a spokesman for the Glazers explains there's no ill-feeling at the Trafford DevilBowl after the Spaniards swept to the top of world football's rich list. ********************* FOOTBALL MOVES INTO THE 20TH CENTURY The Fiver hates being subjected to instant video analysis: the over-eager thrusts and tangled limbs; the puddles of salty sweat; the breathless grunting, like an asthmatic yeti at altitude. Our gym instructor sure gets frustrated with us. When it comes to football, however, we love the idea. After all, would the Robbens and Ronaldos of this world cheat so readily if emphatic justice was a rewound videotape away? Contentious offside and goal decisions would, like Michael Ricketts' England career, soon be consigned to history. And the game would be the better for it. So far, however, all prospects of football embracing the 20th century have hit a Sepp Blatter-sized wall of blubber - for the Fifa president remains implacably opposed to change. But the times may be a changin': today the French FA asked the International FA Board (whose acronym Ifab sounds like a swanky Apple feel-good device) for video replays to be tested in the professional game. And if six of Ifab's eight members (Fifa has four votes, while the four UK associations have one vote apiece) support the proposal next month, it could soon become law. But that's not all that's under discussion at an Ifab meeting in Lucerne on March 4: for Fifa want to yellow card any player who intentionally stops an opponent from restarting play [Isn't that the law already? - Fiver Ed] and, bizarrely, are also lobbying hard for a rule that says players' shirts and shorts cannot be attached to each other [Isn't that the law already? - Fiver Ed], following Cameroon's attempt to play in an all-in-one strip. Sadly reports that Uefa president Lennart Johansson wants to hoard said kits for use on the Stockholm Wrestlers' Over-60s Circuit (Heavyweight Division) remain unconfirmed. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Internazionale forward Adriano has gone all gooey-eyed at talk of a summer move to Real Madrid. The Pope's O'Rangers, the Queen's Celtic, Derby and Wolves face a summer John Woo-style stand-off over Elgin City defender Stuart Cumming. And after being spotted wearing a fake beard, woolly hat and giant scarf while sat among Walsall fans last weekend, David Platt is expected to take charge at the Bescot. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Having presided over Nottingham Forest's descent to 13th in League One, Gary Megson has left the former Big Cup champions by mutual consent. Gerry Francis has unsurprisingly welcomed speculation linking him with a job alongside the next England manager. \"If the FA come knocking and ask me for an interview for any situation with regards to the England set-up, I would obviously go and speak to them about it,\" he declared. Alaves president 'Deadly' Dmitry Piterman is looking for his fourth coach of the season - and his fifth in a little over six months - after giving Juan Carlos Oliva the boot. And Gary Neville is 12-1 with bet365 to kiss his badge during the MU Rowdies' FA Cup clash with Liverpool on Saturday - a shorter price than the 14-1 he is to score. * * * * * * * * * * WIN A SAMSUNG D600 PHONE Send your best sporting picture - Raymond van Barneveld betraying his Lakeside roots for the lure of the Sky shekel, Chemmy Alcott skiing to a fantastic ... 11th, Alan Shearer being uncharacteristically loquacious, albeit on the subject of his charity work ... whatever - taken with your mobile to the.gallery@observer.co.uk now.

Hasn't he done that already?\" - Neil Wadsworth. \"So Everton have 'applied' for the Intertoto Cup (yesterday's Fiver). It seems that wily David Moyes is trying the old 'just-ask-for-the-trophy' approach in a bid to bring some European silverware to Goodison\" - Joe McVey. \"I just read your heart-warming story about Alan Shearer kindly donating one of his many millions to charity. I take it he was advised it was a write-off against capital gains tax by his accountant\" - Paul Honeyfield. As the letters are apparently slowly turning into Monty Python's 'nudge-nudge, wink-wink' sketch, I thought I'd spare a thought for anyone with an Arsenal wife, who requires a ridiculous number of delicate touches before they get anywhere near the box\" - Simon Dunsby. \"I'd like a Tottenham wife. She'll know two little ones up front will never work\" - Simon Ryan. \"A Chelsea wife for me please. She'll stay on top for ages and be pleased to come first\" - Garreth Cummins. \"I have three ex-wives. My Bolton wife was physical and aggressive and got in my face. My Everton wife used to be good, but has seen better days and is now very bitter. And my Jongleurs FC wife was good for a laugh, but had a habit of letting anyone in at the back\" - Ian Medlicott. [Right, that's enough wives ... unless they're particularly amusing - Fiver Ed]. \"Interesting to see both ITV and Five were screening the movie Intolerable Cruelty last night. I watched the Five version, where a portly George Clooney tortured people in a half-empty football stadium\" - Peter Hart. \"If you type 'Allardyce fumes' into Google you get 662 different results. That man does a lot of fuming\" - Michael Dunn. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

Five: Live Euro Vase - VfB Stuttgart v Middlesbore (7.15pm) Even though you're the ones who are supposed to write this. Golazo Football Show (12am) It seems nobody has a website to plug or a sabbatical planned, nor could they be bothered to make one up. Not Live Euro Vase For Those Who Want To Watch VfB Stuttgart v Middlesbore Again (1.05am) Well, nobody except Christopher Bartlett. \"I'd spend my month's paid leave in Rio and use my wages to buy a couple of pallets of Tin,\" he writes, giving it the big I-earn with his TWO pallets. Dutch Football - Utrecht v PSV (2.45am) \"Once set up on the beach I'd hand out a Tin or two to any lovely lady with a bikini smaller than a \u00a310 note,\" he adds as his obsession with materialism gets more and more disturbing. Portuguese Football - Benfica v Penafiel (4.25am) \"Actually, better make that three pallets.\" Sky One: Football League Review (7pm) Honk! Now while we were despairing for want of something to fill up the rest of today's TV &amp; Radio, this crawled into our inbox, from Laura Parkes. \"I had a paid month off work last year,\" she says. \"I went to South Africa for a wedding and then sat around doing nothing for the remainder of the month.\" Fifa Futbol Mundial (11pm) In a bikini smaller than a \u00a310 note, we hope. FA Cup Classics (11.30pm) \"There was sun, nice weather and cheap booze, it's just a pity South Africa is so expensive to get to.\" Bravo: Football Italia: Mezzanotte (12am) And so full of South Africans, eh?

Talksport: Kick-Off (7pm) So why not tell us where you were and what you were doing between the hours of 10pm and midnight last night instead. (Note to Liverpool fans: we're not accusing you of anything). Newstalk 106FM (www.newstalk106.ie): Off The Ball With Ger Gilroy (7pm) We don't care how mundane it was, so tell all to the.boss@theguardian.com in an email marked I Was Working As A Waitress In A Wetherspoon's Bar ... * * * * * * * * * * * * FREE BOOZE AND FOOD?
