The 23-year-old from Bury was struggling, he did not have the look of a man on a good day, he might be on the point of cracking. In fact, every time the main group around Froome hit a major ascent, Yates did the same thing: he pedalled at a rhythm that suited him and rode in the way he always has. \u201cI\u2019ve done that all my life,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just at the Tour: watch any other race in the last two and a half years and I\u2019ll be close to the back looking at the group, working out who looks good. It\u2019s the way I like to ride. It works for me.\u201d His discreet style has earned him a nickname, The Shadow, which he says, \u201cis weird, but I\u2019ll take it\u201d. Just before the start of the final stage, Yates was on the point of becoming the first Briton to wear the White Jersey of best under-25 to Paris in the competition\u2019s 41-year history. Past winners include Francesco Moser, Laurent Fignon, Greg LeMond and Andy Hampsten. His fourth place overall equals Robert Millar\u2019s in 1984 and has only ever been bettered by Chris Froome and Sir Bradley Wiggins. In British terms, this is remarkable and it should not go unnoticed merely because Froome and Wiggins have set the bar so high; at least, it is worth comparing with Tom Simpson\u2019s sixth place overall in his first Tour finish in 1962. \u201cI feel good, we\u2019re here, it\u2019s all done. It\u2019s all been good experience. The plan wasn\u2019t to ride for general classification at the start, but we rolled with it,\u201d Yates said. He added that the decision to switch from targeting stages to aiming for a high overall placing came after he moved into second overall in the Pyrenees. Clearly, he has relished the learning process. \u201cEvery day there has been something new, trying to save energy in the bunch; sometimes it\u2019s hard to relax when there is so much stress so you have to learn to stay calm under pressure. Orica hasn\u2019t been a general classification team, but it\u2019s become more and more [that way] oriented over the race, all the team have been learning as well.\u201d Indeed, on Saturday, when Yates\u2019s overall place was under threat from Roman Kreuziger, Orica could be seen working at the front on his behalf. Understandably, Yates is reticent over the prospect of attempting to win the Tour in future, playing down the notion in the same style as his team manager, Matt White. \u201cI hope in the future I can try for the win, but I have got a couple of years before [that], I\u2019m only 23, this is my second Tour and I\u2019ve come fourth, but I can\u2019t imagine trying to win it all of a sudden. It\u2019s not just about improving my climbing, it\u2019s about time trialling, saving energy, riding in the wind \u2013 there are a lot of things I can work on.\u201d Yates had one off day in the three weeks, on Friday\u2019s stage to Saint-Gervais, where he slipped off the podium after having trouble with his gears. Of an episode that sums up the learning process, he said: \u201cI had a bike change, the pace went up for some reason\u201d \u2013 the Astana team decided to hit the front of the peloton hard \u2013 \u201cand it took a long time to come back. You waste a lot of energy, 100 kilometres from the finish, but that\u2019s the Tour, those are the efforts you pay for in the end. But I\u2019ll take one bad day out of 20.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
