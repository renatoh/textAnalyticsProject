The Welshman missed out on his first professional title when he was narrowly beaten by Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee at the Hana Bank Vietnam Masters but the 23-year-old responded positively, carding an eight-under-par 64 at the Phokeethra Country Club in Siem Reap. He made nine birdies and only a single bogey to end the first round of the Asian Tour event a shot ahead of the American Anthony King. \"I played really well today. I just went out there, got very focused, hit a lot of good shots and was rewarded with a low score,\" said Davies. \"Last week was a great week too. But I can't dwell over one little shot, which I couldn't control and missed in the play-off. It's a new week, great start \u2014 and I hope it continues.\" King, a two-time winner on the Asian Tour, shot eight birdies and a single bogey to take second place, one stroke ahead of Indonesia's Rory Hidayat. Thailand's Chawalit Plaphol is alone in fourth place on 67, with his compatriots Jaidee and Thaworn Wiratchant tied for fifth with Australia's Gavin Flint, Malaysia's Airil Rizman and Korea's Park Jae-bum a further shot back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
