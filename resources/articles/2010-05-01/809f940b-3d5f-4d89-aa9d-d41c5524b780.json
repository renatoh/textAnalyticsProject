That was the hot topic last Friday, after Alexander Chancellor marvelled at the rise and rise of \"SuperClegg\". At theguardian.com/g2, Marcella rejected any suggestion that the Lib Dem leader had grown in stature since the election: \"Oh dear Lord. The man has shown himself to be an unprincipled snake willing to jettison previously held beliefs.\" There were dissenters, but ofap summed up many comments when he remarked: \"A big newspaper made me vote LibDem and then ran away. Unprincipled snake . . . harlot . . . traitor . . . naive . . . yellow . . . Judas . . . Ant . . . Dec . . . toys . . . pram . . . something . . . something . . . DAARK SIIDE and I shall never ever buy the Guardian ever ever again. Except for the crossword.\" And David Cameron? Michele Hanson's confession \"I can't look at our new Leader's face\" drew 276 comments on the website, many likening the PM's face to an upside-down egg, or explaining how queasiness could also be aroused by the likes of George Osborne or Theresa May. \"Quite relieved to read this, I thought it was just me,\" posted wollybully. \"I haven't been able to bring myself to look at or listen to anything to do with the new C word since Tuesday.\" But woodlington reckoned everyone needed to grow up: \"I know it was meant to be a funny article, but I thought it just came across as mean. Slag off his politics if you want, but just for what he looks like?? I thought most of us left that kind of nastiness behind in the playground.\" Saintsimon agreed that the Guardian was \"dumming down\" (not a misprint, but possibly a joke.) Fortunately, Vampyra was there to raise the tone: \"I could look at Nick Clegg all day . . .\" \u2712 On Monday . . . oh my God, we stirred up a hornets' nest, and you, dear readers, were the large, angry insects. The last time we aroused such fury was when we said that Apple Macs were a tiny bit better than PCs, or possibly the other way round. What had we written now? That there might be a curse of The Wire, judging by the careers of four actors from that much-missed TV series. \"A dreadful bit of whingery\", commented saamvisual. \"Epic fail,\" wrote singleta. And they were two of the nicer comments. davejuliette questioned why we were even writing about \"a series that left the air two years ago in the USA . . . The Wire is gone. God bless it, but it's gone.\" We could point out that many of our readers don't live in the US, but . . . no. Move along. There's nothing to see here. \u2712 Unlike the comments on Tuesday, when Emine Saner explored how to deal with workplace stress. \"Thank you. I needed that,\" tweeted @JerichoAdmassu. On the website, there was a lively debate about the extent of the problem, as well as the solution. mirtilo questioned the claim that Britain has the longest working hours in Europe. binky1 advised workers to \"take the unfinished paperwork in the in-tray and put it straight into the out-tray\". Beyourself advised his or her fellow commenters to, well, be themselves: \"Rise up, people, take charge of your lives. Don't buy that house that is 6 times your salary. Holiday in UK. Buy less. Get a hobby. It sure feels better.\" bradgate reckoned this was \"spot-on\". \"It is not actually compulsory to work yourself to death so you can buy consumerist tat in ever larger and more extravagant quantities.\" There was a broad consensus that you shouldn't expect any help from human resources. \"The instant they become aware you have a problem they will begin working to remove you from the organisation,\" claimed Goldfinger.\" But Elle reckoned this was unfair: \"HR professionals are under just as much pressure and always get blamed when things go wrong. I recently got diagnosed with depression and my HR department went out of their way to support me.\" Was anyone listening to Trinity10? \"Might I suggest that actually doing some work rather than wasting time on the internet messageboards might mean you can get to go home on time?!\" Apparently not. Some of you even found a few moments to congratulate Steve Caplin on his cover photomontage, which featured a wrestling match between the Miliband brothers. \"What Photoshop was made for,\" tweeted @LouiseRidley. Elsewhere in G2, Aditya Chakrabortty was asking: \"Are markets our new religion?\" speccyjowlybellend seemed unwilling to commit: \"My own thoughts are between yes and no, but not quite maybe,\" he wrote. Others were more helpful. \"They have all the elements of primitive religion and some of Protestant theology,\" claimed postfeminist. \"They are capricious, angry and judgmental. Above all they demand sacrificial offerings: the poor must be offered up to appease their anger. It's not a flippant comparison by any means, but reveals the extent of the mystification necessary to complete the dismantling of social democracy. The problem is, the entire political class believes it.\" Amon commented: \"All the more reason to insist on the separation of church and state.\" None of this convinced LSEscientist: \"More blame the messenger. Markets are just the collective expression of confidence held or not by hundreds of individuals.\" \u2712 Is Brighton a bohemian paradise? Alexis Petridis's eulogy to his home city on Wednesday impressed Eric Wilkins. \"I will shortly be applying for posts as a secondary school history teacher,\" he emailed g2feedback@theguardian.com, \"and was considering Brighton as a potential place to move. I'd say this is now a certainty.\" In the Twittersphere, @smyjamie tweeted, \"This article made me long to live in Brighton again,\" while @roweenaweb trilled, \"Woo hoo, look fellow Brightonians, we iz coooool.\" This was just what Nocebo and others were fretting about. \"Please stop telling people about Brighton,\" he pleaded back on the website. \"There's enough idiots from London coming down at weekends and clogging the place up already. If more of them find out that it is actually very nice, it will be too full.\" Fortunately, the backlash soon appeared from the not inconsiderable number of you who don't live in the \"British equivalent of San Francisco\". \"Is Brighton Britain's coolest city?\" asked Percyflage. \"No. It's quite nice if you like that sort of thing but I think Alex and the youngsters just don't go to other nice towns very much.\" \"Yawn,\" agreed brokenbones. \"Everyone who lives there has to keep damn well telling us how nice it is.\" Bausage, meawhile, suggested: \"Brighton is only diverse in the sense that it has a wide variety of white middle-class idiots.\" So where would be a better place to live? Manchester, suggested BoftheBing. Stroud, said yianni. Actually, stoneweald pointed out, Brighton is not even the best place to live in East Sussex: \"Hastings down the road is cooler but don't tell anyone!\" \u2712 Finally, to yesterday's G2, and the \"whining\" middle classes, as described by Deborah Orr. On the website, AduDhabiMike popped up with a warning: \"I was once a member of the middle class, resident in England and paying a lot of tax. My tax bill was too high, I thought, so I moved to the UAE, where I earn just as much and pay no tax at all. Ms Orr should beware of advocating further dipping into the pockets of the middle classes in case more of them do as I did.\" That would make it harder to finance big-ticket items such as Trident, of course. But is Britain's nuclear deterrent a waste of money, Patrick Barkham and Richard Norton-Taylor asked in our cover story yesterday. Absolutely not, said MrMydak, who was \"glad to see some focus on the jobs that Trident creates and maintains. Not only in the building yards, but also in the associated industries, in the MOD police and the security companies. I like the fact we have nuclear weapons. Scrap them and you will be killing towns and villages across the country.\" But does Trident exist in the first place? \"We don't really need to have a nuclear deterrent,\" Aireman pointed out. \"We only have to fool the rest of the world into thinking we have one. But then, maybe the Americans thought, 'The British don't really need to have a nuclear deterrent, they only need to believe they've got one.' Is there any evidence that those missiles really work? \" Let's hope we don't find out before next Friday. We need you alive and commenting, at the addresses below. If you would like to comment on any of the stories in G2, or just want to join in the debates, go to theguardian.com/g2 to add your comments, tweet us @guardiang2 or email us at g2feedback@theguardian.com.
