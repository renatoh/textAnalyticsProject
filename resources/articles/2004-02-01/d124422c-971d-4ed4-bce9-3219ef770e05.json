In an emergency Commons statement on the tragedy, rural affairs minister Alun Michael admitted that the government now supported the \"objectives\" behind a backbench bill which has already been tabled for statutory legislation licensing such operations. Previously the government had favoured voluntary accreditation within the industry, but a highly topical bill by backbencher Jim Sheridan has already been tabled calling for full legal accreditation - and may now receive executive backing. Mr Michael told MPs: \"We want to see an end to the misery and exploitation that unscrupulous gangmasters operating outside the law can cause.\" But Mr Michael conceded that the government's normal approach was to consider alternatives to statutory regulation and it had been looking into the possibility of an industry-led accreditation scheme. But in the Morecambe Bay case criminal gangs, who would take no notice of a voluntary scheme, appeared to be involved. \"The government has not ruled out legislation,\" he said, although it had yet to reach a conclusion on the merits of a statutory licensing scheme. Mr Sheridan's private member's bill was due to be debated later this month. Recognising the depth of support for the measure, Mr Michael said he was carefully considering the move with ministers from other departments. He was replying to local Labour MP Geraldine Smith who criticised \"despicable, ruthless, evil\" gangmasters and urged ministers to back Mr Sheridan's bill. Mr Michael said the deaths were a \"human tragedy\" which happened in \"horrific circumstances\", and offered his condolences to friends and family. The incident, he said, involved the \"largest number of work-related deaths\" since the Piper Alpha oil platform tragedy. \"We must do all we can to prevent another tragedy of this sort. \"The exploitative activities of some gangmasters are already well understood. The government has been active in seeking to tackle this difficult and complex area. \"The activity undertaken by gangmasters is not inherently illegal. Some run legitimate business within the law.\" But it was clear a number were meeting shortages of labour in the agricultural and horticultural sectors with illegal immigrants. Cockle fishing in Morecambe Bay is already regulated by the Sea Fisheries Committee, with 700 permits issued. \"It is not clear at this stage whether the Chinese cocklers involved in this tragedy had permits,\" he said. Mr Michael said that if a licensing scheme was introduced the work done on a voluntary scheme would make a valuable contribution to it. \"Gangmasters who operate outside the law cannot be allowed to continue to put workers' lives at risk. The government will ensure the full force of the law is brought to bear on those committing these crimes.\" Ms Smith called on the government to support Mr Sheridan's bill, saying people hoped \"some good must come out of this appalling tragedy\". She paid tribute to the \"magnificent efforts\" of the rescue services and asked what more could be done to regulate fishing in Morecambe Bay where people who knew \"little or nothing\" about the dangers collected cockles. \"One thing we should be thinking of doing immediately is closing that public fishery after the hours of darkness. People should not be working out in Morecambe Bay after dark.\" She said: \"I hope we can stop exploitation - not only of foreign workers but of British workers. \"Some of these gangmasters are absolutely despicable, ruthless, evil people and the reputable gangmasters ... would welcome legislation.\" Mr Michael hinted that access to the bay at night time may now be closed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
