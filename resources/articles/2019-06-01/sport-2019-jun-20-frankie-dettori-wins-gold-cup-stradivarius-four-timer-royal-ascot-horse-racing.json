There is a statue of Dettori near the entrance to Ascot\u2019s Royal enclosure to mark his astonishing day in 1996, and he joked that the course \u201cmight need to get another statue\u201d after winning the first four races on Ladies\u2019 Day with a flawless series of rides. Lester Piggott, in 1965, was the last jockey to ride four winners on the same afternoon at the Royal meeting. A\u2019Ali (5-1), Sangarius (13-2) and Star Catcher (4-1) all won for Dettori before Stradivarius, at even money, completed the four-timer in the Gold Cup, the biggest race of the week. \u201cHe is a phenomenon,\u201d John Gosden, the trainer of Stradivarius, said. \u201cFrankie is like a player who gets to the final of Wimbledon and then raises it to another level. \u201cFor a kid of 48 he is remarkable. And when he rides here he goes to another level. \u201cHe\u2019s been in the gym, working out, and then he comes and rides out for me and he\u2019s so relaxed. The horses are here to do a job, but he does it so beautifully with them and that makes a difference.\u201d Dettori was short of racing room in the closing stages of the Gold Cup but waited for a gap to appear and seized his chance when it did. \u201cI don\u2019t normally hear the crowd because I\u2019m so focused [on the race] but the roar from the crowd was incredible,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cThis horse has captured people\u2019s imaginations and we\u2019ll bring him back next year.\u201d Dettori\u2019s winning streak came to an end when he could finish only second in the fifth race after leading with a furlong to run. \u201cTwenty years ago I would have won that,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cIt was 16-1 this morning and it was favourite [at the start], he gave me a great spin but it wasn\u2019t to be. Listen, I\u2019ve had a good day so I\u2019m not going to cry.\u201d Despite his failure to win either of the last two races on the card, bookmakers said it had been one of their worst days at the Royal meeting. \u201cWe are hugely relieved to have avoided the worst-case scenario of a Magnificent Six,\u201d said Nicola McGeady of Ladbrokes. \u201cBut we are by no means celebrating. A four-timer for the most popular jockey at the biggest meeting of the Flat season is a shocking result and can only be described as a bloodbath.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
