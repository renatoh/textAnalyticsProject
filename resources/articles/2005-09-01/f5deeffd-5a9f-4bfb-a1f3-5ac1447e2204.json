No story there", "bodyText": "It has been a long time coming, but last week's events will, with luck, mark the death of the role-model rant. For longer than is believable, bad writers have been harrumphing about footballers setting a bad example to 'the youth of today'. More often than not their ire is irked by the fact that a footballer whose image their son has on his bedroom wall has let himself and - by what means it is never even partially explained - the writer and his son down. Moving swiftly from the particular to the general, said writer will normally conclude that the footballer, who is an icon in his son's bedroom, has, in fact, let down every sentient teenager in the country. AND MUST BE PUNISHED! The send button is hit, the piece is filed away for future use (note to subs: replace 'Beckham' with 'Rooney') and, job jobbed, the writer toddles off for a self-righteous lunch. Not for a moment does it cross what's left of his mind that the article he has just written says more about his weaknesses than those of the object of his anger. Perhaps it might now, as he calls up the piece, replaces 'Rooney' with 'Moss', and hits send. Perhaps even he will realise that 'Model Takes Drugs!' is, as an excuse for his bile, well, a bit thin. As a result of behaving in a manner entirely consistent with her profession, Kate Moss will no longer be the face of H&amp;M. Pondering this, it might dawn on him that the denouement betrays the poverty of the story. Moss hasn't let down any children; she may have let down her corporate sponsors. A couple of brands may suffer. That's the story. It has always been the nub of the story. At time of writing it has yet to be scientifically proved that sending text messages to someone other than your wife affects your performance on the field. Whether it damages your lucrative endorsement deal is dependent on the markets. The story is more about economic models than role models. Celebrity is morally neutral. Only people who value the brand above all else will blindly follow the famous. Therefore, if we must have sporting role models, they should be people who mercifully buck the system rather than mercilessly screw every penny they can out of it. Sportsmen like Jose Maria Olazabal, the only European golfer currently playing who has a chance of winning a third major. This weekend he is captaining the European team for the Seve Trophy, an event that is unlikely ever to have come into existence if the two Spaniards had not combined for a Ryder Cup record that reads: P15, W11, D2, L2. Beating the Americans has always mattered to him. After the frat party on the 17th green at Brookline in 1999, it was the dignified Olazabal who calmly assumed the moral high ground in the post-tournament press conference, thereby infuriating the American media, who could not understand why someone might be talking about sportsmanship after 'the greatest comeback in the whole wide world of sports\u2122'. A month later at the Dunhill Cup at St Andrews, he holed a long putt and fell to the ground kissing the earth in parody of the pious Ben Crenshaw. It was one of golf's better jokes. Most notably, Olazabal has stayed with the same manager - Sergio Gomez from his home town of Fuenterrabia - throughout his long career. This caused a frustrated Mark McCormack to label him a 'strange guy. Doesn't seem interested at all in the money he could be making.' So strange that, in 1997, he returned six-figure cheques to Titleist and Lacoste on the grounds that, because injury had prevented him from playing, he did not feel that he merited the money. Now that's a role-model story: Beckham/Rooney/Moss returns cheque. Nor is he the only admirable golfer. This weekend Jason Gore opted not to play at the [now weather-threatened] $2million Texas Open so he could fulfil a prior promise to turn up at the $350,000 Boise Open. He first appeared on the scene at this year's US Open when, as a qualifier ranked 818, he went into the final round in the last group. He self-combusted and hit an 84. Instead of taking up sponsors' invitations to play at 'The Big Show' he returned to the Nationwide Tour and won three consecutive titles to earn a 'battlefield promotion'. Last weekend he won the 84 Lumber Classic. 'Around May-ish I was wondering if I could get formula for my child,' he said, 'and now they just handed me a check for $792,000. It's amazing where a little perseverance and grit and maybe a little ignorance can take you.' Gore's caddy wears a cap bearing the logo Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer. There is no deal involved, they both just like the product. He is decent, honest and truthful, just the kind of role model of whom the Advertising Standards Council would approve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
