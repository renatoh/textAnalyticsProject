(Full disclosure: five of my kids went there - and sang C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S many, many times). The Millfields children have recorded the song and video as part of a fundraising drive to help improve their playground and to support the efforts of UNICEF in Syria. To listen is to love it. Download from Amazon or iTunes. Give them your money in other ways via here. A seasonal slice of London at its best. Have a good one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
