The RMT move provoked the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, to quit the union altogether. Yesterday Robin Cook, the leader of the house and another former RMT-sponsored member, upped the stakes by saying he would \"not be bought\" by a union and accepted there was a possible case for a reference to the privileges committee. Mr Cook said all RMT-sponsored MPs in the house had declined to sign an oath of loyalty to the union. As a result, he said no offence had yet occured. \"We're not going to sign up to an oath of loyalty to anybody outside this house\", he added. However, a breach of privilege may occur if members of the campaign group take cash from the RMT in return for agreeing to fight on specific policies. Alternatively the MPs may be required by parliamentary rules not speak on behaf of the RMT in certain debates because they would be breaching commons rules debarring paid advocacy. Mr Cook told MPs: \"We come here as free representatives of our constituents with, of course, our political mandate as a party and we are here to make sure we exercise our best judgment on behalf of our constituents in line with the mandate we receive. \"We are not here to act on behalf of any other specific or particular vested interests or agency. \"That has to be a very important, cardinal principle of membership of this house. The union switched support from Mr Prescott and 12 other MPs to a new group of 14 left-wingers including Diane Abbott, Jeremy Corbyn and Ann Cryer. The issue of a possible contempt was first raised by Paul Tyler, the Liberal Democrat leader of the house. Mr Cook's warning came as the communication workers union at its annual conference agreed to back a decision of its union executive to cut its funding to the Labour Party by \u00a3500,000 over three years. A move to disaffiliate the union from the party altogether was thrown out. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, also joined the debate about the future of the union's links by urging the unions to have a mature relationship with their MPs. Milburn said Labour \"can't and will not act as proxies\" for the unions. The relationship should be about \"fairness not favours\" and unions had to decide what sort of relationships they wanted to have, Mr Milburn said. The health secretary, who has had many brushes with the public services unions, said: \"The unions have got to decide where they want to be, where they want to position themselves, what sort of relationships they want to have.\" He added he had perfectly amicable relations with some union leaders naming Sir Ken Jackson, the general secretary of Amicus, and Unison boss David Prentis. The RMT general secretary, Bob Crow, said Mr Prescott \"is not being dictated to\". \"We are not asking him to vote on any one of these issues at all, whatsoever. \"But I do have to say we set the Labour party up 102 years ago to gain influence for railway workers in parliament. \"It is no different what we are doing now to what we did 102 years ago.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
