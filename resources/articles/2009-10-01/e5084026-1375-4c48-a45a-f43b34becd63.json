Next summer is all about a 90s revival: sportswear and grunge mixed with a massive shot of sex and glamour. Some of the trends seen on the catwalks over the last month are as easy to slip into as an old Nirvana T-shirt, but others will take a little more practice. Here's our pick of the items you'll need to indulge that retro look. Kitten heels After several seasons of stilettos and platforms, the heel beloved of politician's wives has returned. It's true that it isn't the most flattering shape, but the kitten has had a makeover, as seen at Missoni with hippy ribbons and straps; meanwhile Marc Jacobs added feathers at Vuitton; and at Marni, the shoe took on an orthopaedic shape with a thick wooden platform sole. Best kept away from floral bias-cut dresses. Cycling shorts Yes, really. It's partly the new sporty vibe and partly a decency thing. Set to be next summer's answer to leggings, the lycra knee-length short was seen on the most unlikely catwalks, from the short disco versions that peeped out from Armani's cocktail dresses to baggier versions at Marni worn loose over stripy leggings, via Donna Karan, where they were worn under everything. As with leggings, they're not meant to be worn alone. When you see how short and sheer everything is for next summer you'll be begging for a pair. Sportswear Balenciaga made me want to hug its sexy and supple leather hoodies after their Paris show. Gucci's Frida Giannini was also inspired by extreme sports, which showed through in scuba-inspired bodysuits and dresses complete with buckles and cut-outs, while surf-inspired bermuda shorts were the coolest pieces at Topshop Unique. Think Bond girl rather than Bridget Jones on the treadmill, and accessorise with a Louis Vuitton rucksack for the ultimate sporty bag. Safety pins Back in 1994 a then-unknown Elizabeth Hurley wore a black Versace dress seemingly held together by gold safety pins and entered the celebrity stratosphere. Fast-forward 15 years and Versus, the Versace diffusion line now headed up by Scottish super-designer Christopher Kane, has gone safety-pin crazy. Oversized, colourful pins adorned bags and shoes while others were fastened across sexy cut-outs on dresses or used on jacket lapels in a palette of black and red. Visit your local haberdashery shop: this trend is ripe for some DIY experimentation. Bum bags Yes, they strike fear into my heart too. But at Marc Jacobs, the pioneer of the 90s grunge movement, models sauntered down the catwalk wearing bum bags matched to their skirts and shorts. Worn slung low around the hips, they achieved an overall mood of sporty utilitarianism. Over at Louis Vuitton, also designed by Jacobs, the bum bag had taken a luxe turn. In embossed leather complete with tassels and extra pouches or with a fur tail these were oversized and teamed with huge afros. For a cheaper and more immediate version, hit American Apparel where they come in nylon and denim. Neon From tie-dyed dresses at Blumarine to eye-popping fluoro bangles at Diane Von Furstenburg, neon was the alternative to the pretty pastels also fighting for catwalk space last month. Balenciaga's bright orange, green or yellow leather biker leggings really popped, while at Marc by Marc Jacobs dazzling colours were jumbled together apparently at random. Blue with red and green; purple with green and yellow \u2013 you name it, Jacobs had the combination. Layers With next season's sheer, floaty fabrics, we're being encouraged to layer up. Roberto Cavalli's sludgy floral apron dresses were unbuttoned over trousers, Meadham Kirchoff layered T-shirts with tailoring for a deconstructed look, while Marni's blouses were open over vests and wrinkled leggings. Put a long-sleeved T-shirt under a summer dress and add tights and boots if you want to try it now. The swimsuit/body hybrid With poppers at the crotch, the body was the strangest 90s creation. At Versace, swimsuit/body hybrids were worn under plastic dresses or tucked into trousers as tops. Maybe it's because they don't wrinkle up or maybe we've just forgotten how inconvenient they are, but they're starting to appeal for layering over T-shirts and under dresses. The rave whistle Spotted attached to necklaces at the Missoni show, which had a full-on Ibiza It-girl vibe. Remember the raving 90s and blow with pride."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
