Guardiola has until Monday to answer a Football Association charge of \u201cwearing a political message\u201d after he wore the ribbon on the touchline during City\u2019s FA Cup defeat at Wigan Athletic on 19 February. The ribbon was also visible during Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup win over Arsenal at Wembley, meaning he could be charged again. There is also the prospect of another breach of the rule if he decides to wear the ribbon for City\u2019s Premier League trip to Arsenal on Thursday. Guardiola now says he will consider stopping wearing the ribbon. \u201cYeah, of course. It\u2019s more important what is happening with the team and the club than my personal opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to happen but if they ask that, I am going to accept that. They are the bosses. The club is more important than my personal opinion. But my personal opinion is not a political opinion. When men and women put on a red [pink] ribbon it\u2019s because of the support for the breast cancer initiative. \u201cThe same as when I wear the prostate cancer badge. The idea is the same, there are a lot of ribbons, I\u2019m pretty sure there are people all around the world in Spain and Catalonia who do not want to be independent, but they are not agreeing with putting people in jail.\u201d Guardiola would also stop if City\u2019s form was affected. \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t want to damage my team or club,\u201d the 47-year-old said. \u201cMaybe, if at the end we decide [enough publicity] but it\u2019s not for the right or left [politically].\u201d Guardiola may argue the rule was unwittingly broken by him accidentally revealing the ribbon during the second half at Wigan. The ribbon was concealed before the break under a jacket and became visible later as the jacket was unzipped towards the top."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
