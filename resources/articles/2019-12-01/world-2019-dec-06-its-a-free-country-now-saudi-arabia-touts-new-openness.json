School was in full session but they were at the mall, and they didn\u2019t seem to care who knew it. Both girls were uncovered, their abayas held together by only a few buttons, as women dressed more conservatively in full black robes and niqabs breezed by carrying babies and shopping bags. Men in traditional thobes walked past without turning their heads, but the pair caught the eye of a Brazilian man wearing shorts and two full-sleeve tattoos, who stopped to try to talk to them. \u201cI can do what I want,\u201d said Maha, 16. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country now, don\u2019t you know?\u201d For the two teenagers, truanting appeared to be more an act of youthful defiance than an expression of new-found freedom. But in Saudi Arabia these days, that two girls are willing to publicly rebel also testifies to tentative signs of a wider change in the kingdom. \u201cIt\u2019s true I wouldn\u2019t have done this a while ago,\u201d said Rayan, 17. \u201cBecause the [religious police] would have found me. Now I\u2019m not worried about them or anyone else, except maybe my dad.\u201d Two years into a reform programme aimed at opening up a rigid society to a sceptical world, what to wear and how to behave seem very much up for grabs. Strict dress codes have been modified for locals and abandoned for foreigners, laws restricting women\u2019s movements have been rescinded, child custody has been made more equitable and segregation of men and women has been set aside. Rights group and critics in the west point out that the cultural reforms have been accompanied by a ruthless attempt to crush dissent. Activists, clerics and other perceived critics have been arbitrarily detained. A number of women\u2019s rights activists allege that they have been sexually assaulted and tortured. On the question of cultural reform though, there are palpable signs of change. In the Saudi capital, a bastion of cultural austerity and oppression for nearly four decades, is now accepting allcomers. Wrestling troupes, global performers, homegrown singers, and boxers \u2013 including the world heavyweight champion Andy Ruiz Jr, who on Saturday faces Britain\u2019s Anthony Joshua in a title rematch in Diriyah \u2013 are among a host of entertainers lured by the message that what was once forbidden is now welcome. The bare torsos of Joshua and Ruiz adorn posters across Riyadh promoting the kingdom\u2019s first world heavyweight boxing match. Saudi Arabia has taken a leaf from the playbook of its neighbour Qatar, which has built its brand partly by luring global competitions including the 2022 football World Cup. So keen are leaders to tout the new openness, they held a conference during the week to discuss challenges facing the media, inviting international press including the Guardian. The gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul 14 months ago by Saudi state agents was not on the agenda, nor widespread restrictions on freedom of expression, which have long made Saudi Arabia one of the most opaque and difficult places in the world for journalists The cultural transformation, rolled out steadily since late 2017, has been dizzying, and largely embraced by urban elites in Riyadh and the second city, Jeddah, where much of what is now being sanctioned had been enjoyed in private for decades. But beyond the city limits, and even in the outer suburbs, the pace of change \u2013 and the fact it is happening at all \u2013 has caused resentment, anger and even shame. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see this in my lifetime,\u201d said Monira Salman Quaratah, who opened a coffee shop, Cafe Barbera, in a Riyadh suburb three years ago and on Thursday hosted a women\u2019s empowerment forum that drew more than 15 local and foreign women to speak to a new foundation, Saudi Women Stories. \u201cIf I had tried to get such a gathering together back then, they would have shut it down,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now this is a forum for everyone. And I couldn\u2019t be happier. Sometimes I get a customer who complains about the music, or mixing, but I just tell them things have changed.\u201d Among the group was a life coach, Bayan al-Hazimi, 29, who spends one week a month studying in London and the rest of her time working on a fledgling practice that she hopes will become a career. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t understand the difference between therapy and coaching at first,\u201d she said. \u201cBut once you explain it to them, they get it. And I think it will be the same with people who don\u2019t like the cultural changes. When they see people coming here and respecting them and our customs, they soften. The conservatives need to learn how to coexist.\u201d Many in Riyadh and more in the country\u2019s smaller communities seem disinclined to do that. In the eyes of some observers, rural conservatives in particular may never fully embrace the changes set in motion by the heir to the throne, Mohammed bin Salman. Cultural reforms were one plank of an attempt to re-engineer most aspects Saudi life \u2013 an ossified economy, implacable opposition to most entertainment and a rejection of anything depicting the pre-Islamic era. The push has dismantled a long-held accommodation that allowed the country\u2019s leaders to run the affairs of state while hardline clerics defined and enforced the national character. In its place, an Arab nationalist police state is emerging, underpinned by the heir to an absolute monarchy who has ruthlessly consolidated his power base while eliminating dissent. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a difficult bridge to cross,\u201d said one observer who has spent much of the past two decades immersed in conservative Saudi society. \u201cFor many, it\u2019s actually shameful. And shame is a very powerful notion in this part of the world. They are saying this is against the values of the kingdom and of the faith, that this is an imposition which pays no heed to values or customs. \u201cThe other thing is, they won\u2019t dare speak against what is happening, because they have seen the price to pay for doing so. There is a culture of fear in Saudi Arabia now that wasn\u2019t there before the reforms. The pact is: you can have your freedoms, but in return you lose your tongue.\u201d Fear of cultural erosion remains strong within conservative ranks and is amplified by the western concerts and festivals now regularly passing through Riyadh. \u201cIf the cultural aspects were more indigenous,\u201d there would be less pushback, said a second observer. \u201cThe conservatives need to be handled carefully here.\u201d For Hazimi, the life coach, something has clearly changed among her conservative family. \u201cI am now regularly going outside my comfort zone,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not have been comfortable to express myself like this before, and nor would anyone else I know. \u201cOne of my [female] friends is now an archery champion here. Others are finding their voices. Our generation needs to accept that the children who come next will be raised differently.\u201d Last month, however, Human Rights Watch said: \u201cIt\u2019s not real reform in Saudi Arabia if it takes place in a dystopia where rights activists are imprisoned and freedom of expression exists just for those who malign the dissidents.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
