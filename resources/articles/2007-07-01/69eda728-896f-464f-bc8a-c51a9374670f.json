For odds compilers, the speculation surrounding the ins and outs at the top teams presents an opportunity to tweak outright odds and come up with a vast array of special bets. Now is the perfect time for punters to take the plunge. Major signings can have an impact on the 2007-08 outright market and with Manchester United having spent the most money so far it has been no surprise to see Sir Alex Ferguson's side cut in the betting. The champions are a best-price 11-8 (general) - in from 7-4 - to win the title. Chelsea, whose activity has centred mainly on free signings, are 13-8 (Betfred and Ladbrokes). Liverpool, steady at 6-1 (Betfred), have flexed their muscles by signing Fernando Torres. Arsenal, having sold Thierry Henry, have been pushed out to 12-1 (Bet365 and Blue Square) - their biggest price at the start of a season since Ars\u00e8ne Wenger took charge. As per usual, a large slice of the clubs' transfer funds has been spent on strikers, with Torres' move the most expensive. Those rushing to take the 16-1 (general) about the Spaniard finishing the season as the top Premiership goalscorer should be aware that only once has he managed 20 goals in a league season, and then five were penalties. In the five seasons he was first choice at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Torres averaged over 15 goals per term, suggesting the 8-11 Bet365 offers that he nets 12 or more in the league represents a touch of value. Carlos Tevez's move to Manchester United may have hit a snag, but the bookmakers believe he will ply his trade at Old Trafford. Betfred offers 11-2 he will not score in his first 10 league games for United (it took him 17 Premiership matches to get off the mark at West Ham), while 20-1 (Coral) is the best price about him winning the Premiership's Golden Boot. Coral was first out of the blocks regarding Craig Bellamy at West Ham, offering 2-5 he will score against a former club and 10-1 he will be booked or sent off for a challenge on John Arne Riise - remember the golf club incident? The Welshman has never been the most prolific goalscorer, so rather than take the 5-6 (Sky Bet) he nets 10 or more top-division goals in 2007-08, it could pay to back him at 8-11 (Coral) to score fewer than 12. He has twice managed more than that. A better bet for a double-figure goal haul could be Portsmouth's David Nugent, who is 11-8 with VC Bet to do so. Darren Bent and Andy Johnson have proved strikers from the Championship can have an impact in the Premiership. Sven-Goran Eriksson's arrival at Manchester City has produced options for punters wanting to back against the former England manager. William Hill will lay you 10-3 that Eriksson fails to last a full year, while Ladbrokes go 8-1 he will be out by Christmas and 33-1 the Swede is the next Premiership manager to leave his post."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
