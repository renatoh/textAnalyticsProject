That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for reading. Night! Gareth Bale speaks! \u201cWe had good chances that maybe we could have taken on another day,\u201d the Wales forward says. \u201cWe had a lifeline at the end. Tried to get it forward. Maybe rushed it a little bit.\u201d Nations League results GROUP A1 Netherlands 2-0 France GROUP C3 Cyprus 1-1 Bulgaria Slovenia 1-1 Norway GROUP D4 Gibraltar 2-6 Armenia Liechtenstein 0-1 FYR Macedonia GROUP B1 Slovakia 4-1 Ukraine GROUP B4 Wales 1-2 Denmark There\u2019s to be no famous comeback from Wales despite that late goal from Gareth Bale. Denmark, who took control thanks to goals from Nicolai Jorgensen and Martin Braithwaite, have won Group B4 and relegated the Republic of Ireland in the process. Wales gave it everything, but they lacked composure in both boxes against a good side. It\u2019s all over. That\u2019s a huge win for the Netherlands, who have deservedly seen off the world champions thanks to goals from Georginio Wijnaldum and Memphis Depay, giving them a chance to reach the Nations League finals when they host Germany on Monday. Oh, and if that wasn\u2019t enough, this win for the Dutch means Germany have been relegated. Ouch. Depay chips the penalty down the middle and the world champions are beaten! Moussa Sissoko\u2019s poor touch gives Frenkie de Jong a chance to nip in and win the ball. Sissoko compounds his error by tripping De Jong! A late equaliser for Norway in Group C3. Or is it? A hopeful long ball from Ashley Williams runs through to Bale, who controls brilliantly and rounds Schmeichel before slotting into the empty net. There are likely to be five added minutes. After all that nonsense, Denmark dust themselves down and Braithwaite makes the game safe. A throw-in from the right\u2019s somehow allowed to bounce to Braithwaite, who takes a touch before whacking a rising shot into the top corner. Ampadu was dozing. The group should be Denmark\u2019s. Tempers are frayed in Cardiff. Age Hareide and Ryan Giggs are having words on the touchline, the two coaches clashing after Ethan Ampadu, enraged by a nasty challenge from Kasper Dolberg a few minutes ago, picks up a booking for a slightly ridiculous foul. It\u2019s Gareth Bale. He takes that familiar run-up and wobbles a brilliant effort over the wall and towards the top-left corner. Yet Schmeichel\u2019s behind it all the way and the Denmark goalkeeper leaps to make a superb save. Wales can\u2019t believe it. Delaney picks up a booking for bringing down Harry Wilson. A free-kick to Wales in a promising position. Wilson or Bale? Denmark counter and Eriksen slips a disguised pass through to Poulsen, who lashes over. That should have ended up in the back of the Welsh net. Virgil Van Dijk\u2019s error almost lets in Antoine Griezmann, but the France forward can\u2019t bring the ball under his spell. Up the other end, Hugo Lloris mkakes two more outstanding saves from Memphis Depay. Hugo Lloris keeps France in the game, beating Memphis Depay\u2019s low free-kick to safety. A fine save from the France goalkeeper. Ousmane Dembele is on France, who are starting to spend a lot of time in the Dutch half. Over in Rotterdam, the Netherlands still lead 1-0 against France, who aren\u2019t doing much. As it stands, Germany are getting relegated. It\u2019s not been their year. Now Roberts goes down in the Denmark area, claiming a push from Andreas Christensen. The Welsh appeals are waved away. With Wales pressing for an equaliser, the unmarked Roberts heads wide from eight yards. That was a decent chance. Gibraltar were beating Armenia 1-0. Yura Movsisyan has responded by scoring four goals for Armenia, who lead 4-1. A red smoke bomb has been thrown on to the pitch in Cardiff. I\u2019m not sure the home fans have helped their team with that banter. Make that a three-goal lead. Slovakia have their two-goal lead back! Brooks twists and turns and tries to curl one into the top corner from 20 yards. Schmeichel watches it float wide. An email! \u201cYour post on the Holland-France \u2018greatest final that never happened\u2019 and link to highlights of their Euro 2000 group-stage clash at the Amsterdam Arena reminded me of this photo, taken by the German photographer Andreas Gursky and turned into a work of art,\u201d Peter Oh says. \u201cI remember seeing it in its full glory at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art about 15 years ago.\u201d It\u2019s all happening. The visitors have one back at the start of the second half. Another problem for Wales at the back: James Chester has a knee injury. On comes Chelsea\u2019s Ethan Ampadu. Here come Wales, Bale surging down the right and swerving a cross into the midfield. Under pressure from the flying Schmeichel, Brooks somehow volleys over! Peep! The second halves are underway. Half-times GROUP A1 Netherlands 1-0 France GROUP C3 Cyprus 1-0 Bulgaria Slovenia 1-0 Norway GROUP D4 Gibraltar 1-1 Armenia Liechtenstein 0-0 FYR Macedonia GROUP B1 Slovakia 2-0 Ukraine GROUP B4 Wales 0-1 Denmark Nicolai Jorgensen\u2019s goal means that the visitors have a deserved lead at the break. If it stays like this they\u2019ll have Group B4 wrapped up. Gini Wijnaldum\u2019s goal is the difference in Group A1. Wales press for an equaliser, attacking down the left, and Bale has an effort deflected over. Corner. A mistake from N\u2019Zonzi sees a long ball reach the pink-haired Ryan Babel in the France area. The Dutch forward sees his firm low shot saved by Lloris, but Wijnaldum is in the right place to convert the rebound and give the hosts the lead against the world champions! This is a wonderful goal. Denmark break and Poulsen\u2019s brilliant touch sends Jorgensen through, allowing the No9 to slot a clinical low finish under Wayne Hennessey. By the way, Armenia have equalised against Gibraltar. Yura Movsisyan got the goal. Paul Dummett\u2019s evening\u2019s over. The Wales left-back can\u2019t continue. On comes Chris Gunter for his 92nd cap, equalling Neville Southall\u2019s record. Wales probe down the right. In comes the cross. Bale rises highest and looks certain to score, only to nut the ball wide from six yards! He claims it came off a defender last, but a goal-kick\u2019s awarded. Not that he can complaint too much given that Martin Braithwaite had a good goal disallowed for offside a few moments ago. Ryan Babel uses his pink hair to head Blaise Matuidi\u2019s snapshot off the line. That\u2019s the closest France have come. Juraj Kucka doubles Slovakia\u2019s lead! A free-kick to France on the left. Wijnaldum heads Griezmann\u2019s delivery away, but Pavard runs on to the loose ball and rips a fierce shot just over the angle of post and bar from 25 yards. Shades of that goal against Argentina. But not quite. A left-footed shot from Panayiotis Zachariou gives Cyprus the lead. N\u2019Golo Kante makes an error - honest - and the Dutch almost break through on goal. But Memphis Depay\u2019s offside. Virgil van Dijk steps across to stop Kylian Mbappe going on a power surge. Obviously that means Liverpool will beat PSG. Ryan Babel has dyed his hair pink. That is all. The rather excellent David Brooks skips down the right, holding off Delaney and surging inside before finding Tom Lawrence. The midfielder\u2019s deflected shot flies over. Wales are pushing hard. Wales have stepped it up in the last few minutes, Bale testing Schmeichel from long range and Williams heading a good chance wide. This is a good, open game. This is what it\u2019s all about. Benjamin Verbic is credited with the last touch, giving the hosts the lead in Group C3. Marek Hamsik finds Albert Rusnak, who finishes coolly to give Slovakia the lead against the dominant force in Group B1. Denmark cause more problems, Larsen escaping down the left. His cross is poor but it almost drifts inside Hennessey\u2019s far post. The Wales goalkeeper is grateful to see the ball sail away from goal. Moments later Delaney rattles one over from long range. France look pretty rattled at the moment, with Kante giving away a free-kick after handling on the halfway line. Holland are playing with plenty of intensity. Can they keep this up? Or are France sucking them in? Denmark threaten in the third minute, Christian Eriksen letting fly from 25 yards. The midfielder\u2019s shot whistles inches over the Wales goal. Holland look to make a fast start and break down the right flank. France are opened up and a cutback from Depay reaches Wijnaldum, who sees his shot pushed away by Lloris! The Liverpool midfielder might have been more clinical with that effort. Peep! Off we go. It\u2019s noisy in Rotterdam, where the French fans are making themselves heard. We\u2019ve had the football. It\u2019s time for the Nations League to rock and roll. Here come the teams! They\u2019re also out in Rotterdam. Holland, all in orange, are going to receive tremendous backing from the locals as they take on France, the world champions. There\u2019s a cracking atmosphere at the Cardiff City Stadium. The teams are about to emerge. Ryan Giggs has just called this a cup final. In the Sky studio, James Collins says that he never really enjoyed playing at the Millennium Stadium. In a list of great finals that never happened, Holland v France at Euro 200 is up there. But let\u2019s enjoy what happened when they met in the group stages. Hello and welcome to another night of strangely compelling Uefa-sanctioned F.U.N. For all the weirdness of the format, you have to admit that there\u2019s something delightfully moreish about the Nations League, so much so that it\u2019s impossible to imagine a better way to soend a Friday evening than watching Gibraltar versus Armenia and Liechtenstein versus Macedonia in Group D4. However, less adventurous Nations League nuts might have their eyes on events in Group A1, where Holland host France in Rotterdam. France can seal their spot in the semis with a draw and will start as heavy favourites against Ronald Koeman\u2019s side. Yet the Dutch, who are still reeling from their failures to qualify for the last two international tournaments, will be buzzing after last month\u2019s win over Germany and will be a point off top spot with one game left if they beat the world champions. As an added motivation for Holland, they\u2019ll also relegate the struggling Germans with a win this evening. They visit Joachim Low\u2019s ailing side on Monday and would love nothing more than the chance to have a chuckle at the expense of their old rivals. Yet pulling off an upset against France will not be easy. The French boast class and experience in every position and will probably have too much for the Dutch if they hit their top level. It promises to be an intriguing encounter. But that\u2019s not all! Moving down a level, the eye falls on Denmark\u2019s visit to Wales in Group B4. The Welsh, who are two points above the Danes, will guarantee top spot if they win. But Ryan Giggs won\u2019t underestimate opponents who reached the last 16 of the World Cup. His team were outplayed when they suffered a 2-0 defeat away to Denmark in September and are going to need Gareth Bale to be at his absolute best, else the visitors may well secure the draw or win that would relegate the Republic of Ireland relegated. It\u2019s all to play for!
