He tied with Yu Yangyi, then crushed his Chinese rival 2-0 in the speed tie-break. Carlsen\u2019s first-round draw with the lowly ranked Georgian woman champion Nino Batsiashvili looked ominous but then he took off with some fine tactical and strategic chess, notably with a brilliancy against Li Chao and a fast win against the dangerous Shak Mamedyarov. A tougher test awaits Carlsen when the elite Tata Steel Wijk tournament starts on 15 January but, with victories in London and Qatar under his belt, he looks to be overcoming the erratic form which dogged him for much of 2015. Several potential Carlsen rivals competed in Qatar. The former world champion Vlad Kramnik tied for third half a point behind Carlsen and advanced to world No2 but Kramnik is not qualified for the Moscow candidates in March which will decide the next title challenger. Holland\u2019s current world No3, Anish Giri, and Russia\u2019s Sergey Karjakin, both candidates, halved too often. England\u2019s No2 David Howell, 25, scored 5.5/9 with only one defeat, a par result in such company despite his self-imposed handicap of continued addiction to time trouble. Howell was often down to just the 30-second per move increment and missed some chances. The big loser was Wei Yi, Chinese champion at 16 and freely canvassed as a future Carlsen challenger. The teenager lost in the very first round and from then on struggled to impose himself against opponents rated around 200 points lower. He did score in one elegant finish where he sacrificed queen for rook and bishop to create a zugzwang, then calmly marched his king up the board before transposing to a won pawn endgame. But another ending, featured in this week\u2019s puzzle, ended disastrously and Wei Yi\u2019s 4.5/9 total shed a bucket of rating points. Wei Yi, like Carlsen, starts at Tata Steel in a fortnight\u2019s time, so needs an urgent repair job. Otherwise China did well in Qatar with Yu, who won Qatar 2014, tying for first. Blitz chess is rarely played in Beijing, so Yu\u2019s play-off debacle against Carlsen was predictable. The tournament received glowing reports due to its high-class playing conditions and interesting entry. Elite GMs, top women players, talented juniors, and unknown locals were all in the mix. The rating floor 0f 2300 excluded weak players and meant that the field was sufficiently small for there to be several games among key contenders. Top chess now has three competing models: all-play-alls with a small select invited group, large knockouts (like the World Cup) and very strong opens (like Qatar and Tradewise Gibraltar). At present they all flourish but, come the next recession, it could be survival of the fittest. Mamedyarov v Carlsen was routine until the Azeri tried to be bold with 17 h4?! and 20 d5? Optically it looked good, in reality the white d5 pawn was self-pinned and lost. With Black a pawn up, Mamedyarov tried another tactic by 24 Bxf5? which lost a piece to Rc6!
