The exchange said its shares would be switched to the main London market by the end of July in a move designed to increase its flexibility and firepower as it bids for a dominant position in the battle over cross-border share trading. The plans, presented by chairman Don Cruickshank and chief executive Clara Furse, were given a generally warm welcome though shareholders will be looking for a detailed breakdown over the coming months. LSE shares are now traded through a dedicated facility run by brokers Cazenove, and the move to a main market listing will mark the final stage in its transition from a mutually owned organisation to a fully fledged publicly quoted company. Deutsche B\u00f6rse has already floated on the Frankfurt market, and Euronext - the alliance of the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam bourses, is due to come to market within weeks. Mrs Furse said the LSE operated in a \"fast moving and competitive market place. I am determined that the exchange should seize opportunities presented by its position in that market. If that means actively pursuing corporate deals, that is what we will do\". The battle between the bourses is increasingly shifting from trading to clearing and settlement where the industry sees scope for competitiveness enhancing cost cutting. Mrs Furse underlined the radical nature of the exchange's strat egy yesterday with a warning that: \"As a business we must seek to position ourselves as Europe's leading capital market exchange organisation and exchange services provider rather than purely as a stock exchange.\" The LSE does not plan to raise cash through the listing, reckoning it has plenty of financial firepower. It has \u00a3150m in the balance sheet, credit lines of up to \u00a3250m and will be able to use its shares as an acquisition currency. The strategy was announced alongside results which showed the exchange's operating profits up 39% to \u00a357.9m last year. Pretax profits were hit by costs of \u00a318.9m from the failed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse and the defence of the hostile bid from Sweden OM Group and fell more than a third to \u00a330.4m. LSE shares last night closed at \u00a335.50 - up from \u00a325 on the day Mrs Furse's appoint ment was announced and giving the exchange a value of just over \u00a31bn. As part of the move to the main market the LSE is planning a nine-for-one bonus issue and is seeking to remove the 4.9% limit on any holding. Mrs Furse yesterday played down fears that the removal of the cap would make the group vulnerable. Angela Knight, the chief executive of Apcims, the private client brokers association, said it would put an end to the position where the LSE was \"neither the fish of a mutual organisation nor the fowl of a full blown PLC.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
