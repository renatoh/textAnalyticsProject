Anyone of a delicate disposition should probably look away now, and avoid London's South Bank in June at all costs. If you get the chance to play God with an arts festival, you need to make damn sure you get to play ball with a personal hero. One can only imagine Cocker's chuffedness when he winkled film composer John Barry out of the hollow in his piano bench to conduct the London Philharmonic Orchestra through a selection of his classic works. Jarvis will be playing along, of course. Barry isn't the only venerable old master on hand. Long-lost singer-songwriter Melanie plays her first UK date for 30 years. This 14th nervous Meltdown hosts the first ever UK performance by Roky Erickson, the man who first gave the world psychedelic rock. Few seminal artists of the Sixties - save perhaps Brian Wilson - melted down so comprehensively as the legendary one-time leader of garage psych band the 13th Floor Elevators, whose insanity plea on a minor drugs rap in the late Sixties landed earned him punitive electro-shock treatment and a lifetime of damage. The 13th Floor Elevators influenced anyone who has ever wielded a guitar in disarray, not least Iggy &amp; The Stooges, Motorhead (both on the bill) and The Jesus And Mary Chain. Warring brothers before Liam and Noel had imbibed either cigarettes or alcohol, the Mary Chain have re-united after eight years (but hopefully have not reformed). Anyone who has ever wielded a synthesizer in anger - as Cocker often has - is in some debt to art-pop provocateurs Devo, who play their first European tour in 15 years. Now that Cocker is a dad, he has had it up to the gills with the tunes that accompany Disney's celluloid fare. Hence The Forest Of No Return, a series of performances of vintage Disney tunes marshalled for evil by ex-Saturday Night Live music producer Hal Wilner, who is now better known as a maverick compiler. Stranger still is The Valerie Project, in which a swathe of weird-folk musicians (from Espers, Fursaxa and their ilk) perform a new score to a 1970 Czech film, Valerie And Her Week Of Wonders. Elsewhere, cowled two-piece drone metallers Sunn 0))) will threaten the fabric of the South Bank's refurb with their bad vibrations. As befits a musician with a palpable interest in visual art and film soundtracks, Cocker's Meltdown offers documentaries about musicians, movies about art, and installations. That key-like jingling you might hear in the background of everything on the bill is the sound of an outsider who came in from the cold, and brought his good taste with him. But will anyone go see Motorhead and Melanie? Has Jarvis pulled off a blinder, or are you covering your ears already?
