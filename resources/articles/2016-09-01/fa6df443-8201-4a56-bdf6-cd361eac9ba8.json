But it is watchable and even intriguing in its weird way. Canadian star Sarah Gadon is in full Hitchcock-blonde mode as Natalie Drax, the mother of a strange, accident-prone boy called Louis (Aiden Longworth). Poor Louis tumbles from a cliff, after a confrontation with his violent stepfather Peter (Aaron Paul) during a family picnic, but miraculously survives in a coma and comes under the care of Dr Allan Pascal (Jamie Dornan), a specialist in sleepwalking and consciousness while in a vegetative state. Creepy stuff starts happening. It\u2019s a bit ridiculous, but hits its own quirky stride \u2013 quite similar to Soderbergh\u2019s thriller Side Effects in its way. Not a bad rental."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
