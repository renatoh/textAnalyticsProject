The manager\u2019s position is under scrutiny following the defeats, with Wednesday\u2019s 2-1 reverse to the Turkish champions of particular concern given the slipshod defending that preceded both goals. Yet Solskj\u00e6r shrugged off the criticism. \u201cYou have to be mentally strong, there are demands on any Manchester United player, coach and manager,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is also an expectation \u2013 we are at the best and biggest club in the world and you don\u2019t expect to have anything but criticism then; it\u2019s how you deal with that setback and from what I\u2019ve seen from the boys they\u2019ve been very focused.\u201d He is also confident that Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, and the rest of the hierarchy remain intent on the plan Solskj\u00e6r is pushing. \u201cI am going to say all my conversations with the club have been planning long term,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course we want results in the short term but I\u2019ve had positive good dialogue with the plans we have put in place. We have planted a seed, the tree is growing. Some clubs just rip up that tree and see if it is still growing and see if it is still getting water underneath. \u201cFor me I have had a backing all the way since I\u2019ve come in [regarding] the bigger picture. And the club needs to look at the bigger picture, we can\u2019t go thinking and reacting to one or two results, we have got to look further back and what is the direction we are going.\u201d\u2028 The 47-year-old was asked if Saturday\u2019s lunchtime trip to Everton is make-or-break regarding his job. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a very good, open and honest and positive dialogue with the club,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve shown strong leadership \u2013 I\u2019ve had good dialogue continually \u2013 since I came in and I don\u2019t expect the wind to turn [for his job be in jeopardy]. \u201cI have grown up here. I became a man at Manchester United [when a player from 1996-2007] and have learned how to deal with good and bad times. Every game of football becomes history quickly and we need to go to Goodison Park in a positive frame of mind.\u201d United have lost three Premier League matches \u2013 all at home \u2013 and stand in 15th place with seven points from six games. Solskj\u00e6r, however, still believes he will be successful at United. \u201cYeah, why shouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d the Norwegian said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t trust my beliefs and values and my staff\u2019s quality and players\u2019 quality, who else should? I don\u2019t look at one or two results and fall like a house of cards. \u201cIt\u2019s a setback, definitely [but] there\u2019s been too much made of not scoring against Arsenal and Chelsea [a 0-0 draw] because there\u2019s been more or less nothing in those two games.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r cited the 2-1 and 5-0 victories over Paris Saint-Germain and RB Leipzig in the Champions League as a reason to be positive. \u201cIt\u2019s not long ago we were the best thing since sliced bread when we beat Leipzig and PSG,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is in football. You have to have that belief in yourself, the club, the players. And the club have been very positive and shown me their character and strong leadership, so I\u2019m looking to Saturday lunchtime.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r did admit, however, he is concerned about how the coronavirus pandemic might be affecting his squad\u2019s mental health. \u201cTimes are different, times are strange. It is a strain on the players, football is not the same without fans and passion,\u201d he said. \u201cThat takes away from it. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s been in the situation the players are in now. They have had months and months of playing with uncertainty and the unknown of the virus and the pandemic. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s easy to sit at home and think football is the same and you [can] expect the same from everyone. Sometimes you have to look after them, physically and mentally, and these are things I think about a lot. I am thinking about how my players cope with the whole situation. I\u2019m a definite believer in these boys and they will come back and show how much they care.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
