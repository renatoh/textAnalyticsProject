Very little in her recital, which kicked off the Wigmore's new season on Saturday, was quite what one expected. She opened in quintessential DiDonato territory with a group of arias by Vivaldi. Thereafter, however, she determinedly explored new areas and styles with songs by Chausson, Turina and Copland, before ending with Gershwin and Judy Garland. She is, she told us, ultimately a Kansas girl, and dedicated her performance of Somewhere Over the Rainbow to her late father, who had always rather liked her singing it. Not all of it worked. Vivaldi sounds odd and at times perversely romantic with piano accompaniment, despite the bravado and sensitivity of DiDonato's singing and David Zobel's fluidly beautiful playing. The Chausson songs, meanwhile, proved an unvarying group, chosen, one suspects, to allow DiDonato to show off sustained pianissimos in the extreme upper registers of her voice. Technically, this kind of singing is beyond all but the most accomplished of mezzos. Too much of it, however, sounds like an exquisite effect rather than an integrated form of expression. Turina was represented by Poema en Forma de Canciones; Copland by eight of the Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson. They require great powers of declamation as well as vocal strength, and DiDonato was tremendous on both counts. These were performances guaranteed to dispel previous criticisms of imperfect diction on her part. Sound and sense were immaculately fused, and in the Dickinson we were conscious of hearing great poetry as well. Turina, meanwhile, makes the pianist as much a protagonist as the singer and Zobel delivered his big solos with moody intensity and formidable dexterity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
