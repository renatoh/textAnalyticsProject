USA!! USA!!! election, and the confounding peaks and troughs that have come with it, has probably been a doddle to follow for football fans. It\u2019s really been all about games in hand. You always want to count them as three points in the table of your mind\u2019s eye, but we really know deep down that there\u2019s a big difference in whether you\u2019ve got a tricky away at Florida Panhandle Rovers or you\u2019re taking on Lackawanna County United on home turf. After all, teams can get off to all the storming starts they want but it\u2019s all about who is top of the pile come the end of the season. The difference is that reaching a lofty perch early in a season isn\u2019t really for nought. Blackpool fans, for example, have been through the mill of late, but the Premier League table from 14 August 2010 \u2013 when a 4-0 opening-day win over Wigan had them at No 1 of the 92 \u2013 still has a special place in Tangerine hearts. And so it\u2019s no small deal that Southampton have the chance to vault to the Premier League\u2019s summit on Friday evening with a win over Newcastle. It\u2019s 32 years since the Saints last marched all the way to the top. \u201cIf you told me this would happen before the season, I would say you are a little bit stupid,\u201d chuckled Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. \u201cWe are lucky that we play Friday evening because it gives us a great chance.\u201d Indeed, six teams are in with a chance of topping the table by the end of the weekend \u2013 and two of them meet on Sunday. And not at the Etihad but at the King Power, where a managerial love-in (\u201che\u2019s done a fantastic job\u201d \u2013 cooed Brendan of Nuno; \u201che\u2019s an amazing manager\u201d \u2013 gushed Nuno of Brendan) should give way to a cracking contest between Leicester and Wolves sides with genuine top-four aspirations. Elsewhere, under-fire Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r (\u201cI don\u2019t look at one or two results and fall like a house of cards\u201d) takes a suspiciously house-of-cards-esque Manchester United to an Everton side whose own dalliance with top spot has been followed by a reality clattering into them like Jordan Pickford coming out for a corner. \u201cIt is true they were up and down in this first period of the season,\u201d said Carlo Ancelotti of his team\u2019s opponents. \u201cBut in some games they played really well,\u201d he added, patting Solskj\u00e6r gently on his head. Spurs travel to West Brom with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho rehashing some of his 2014 material about kick-off times. And to cap it all off Manchester City and Liverpool meet in the most pivotal clash to the outcome of a title since [shoehorn your own Pennsylvania/Wisconsin/Michigan reference here if you must].

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI don\u2019t expect people to write me a wonderful epitaph but I thought it was very disrespectful. Having said that, I moved on very quickly. It\u2019s not scarred me\u201d \u2013 Nigel Pearson gets his growl on with Ben Fisher about Watford\u2019s pithy 49-word statement to mark his exit, plus riding horses and what football needs to do now. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Football Weekly Extra is right here for you. Also, tickets are available for this on Monday. FIVER LETTERS \u201cSince we\u2019re into apologies (yesterday\u2019s Fiver), on behalf of at least 140 million Americans, I apologise for our national election results being as convoluted as the Uefa Nations League\u201d \u2013 JJ Zucal. \u201cAs a Wimbledon fan, it was wonderful to see the team finally return home on Tuesday night and have Joe Pigott claim the first goal at the new Plough Lane. At first I was devastated to see Doncaster claim a 91st-minute equaliser. However, over the last couple of days I have since learned from a certain global leader that we can stop counting when in an advantageous position. Therefore, I stopped counting goals at the 90th minute and, hey presto, Wimbledon have a 2-1 win and two additional points in League One. Can someone let Rick Parry know?\u201d \u2013 Robert Way-Bradley. \u201cMaybe Gunnersaurus will pay Mezut \u00d6zil\u2019s speeding fine for him (yesterday\u2019s Quote of the Day)?\u201d \u2013 Martyn Shapter.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Diego Maradona has been sedated by doctors to help him cope with withdrawal symptoms and will remain in hospital, even though he wants out. \u201cThis was one of the few times where Diego has been told no,\u201d said his doctor, Leopoldo Luque. Ongoing lockdown or not, Boris Johnson has been urged to fulfil a general election pledge [honk \u2013 Fiver Ed] and launch a fan-led review of football. Labour MP Ian Mearns wrote: \u201cThe Covid-19 disruption has brought to the fore some of the many challenges, both financial and at a governance level, which have been allowed to fester out of the spotlight for decades \u2026 It is becoming increasingly urgent that the government intervene and deliver on its promises.\u201d New manager news: League Two strugglers Mansfield have appointed Nigel Clough. Neil Warnock reckons his Middlesbrough side are unappealing opponents for Championship wannabes. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that we\u2019re very, very good, but I don\u2019t think you want to play us,\u201d he cheered. You won\u2019t find any envy from Wolves boss Nuno after Diogo Jota\u2019s hot start at Liverpool. \u201cWhen a player goes and succeeds, it makes us happy,\u201d he cooed. Super Mr 15%s are being targeted by Fifa under new regulations. Unhappy Queen\u2019s Celtic boss Neil Lennon is feeling funky after a home roasting by Sparta Prague in Big Vase. \u201cIt\u2019s poor.

It may already look bleak for Ronnie K at 12th-placed Barcelona, but he\u2019s hopeful of an improvement. \u201cTeams like Bar\u00e7a need to be near the top all the time and if they are, then there is always criticism,\u201d he tooted. \u201cWe cannot become obsessed by it.\u201d Tottenham manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is uneasy that Gareth Bale will be under the jurisdiction of Arsenal coach Albert Stuivenberg while with Wales. \u201cHonestly, it doesn\u2019t make me very comfortable,\u201d he parped. \u201cNational team matches should not [have] coaches who work for other clubs.\u201d STILL WANT MORE?
