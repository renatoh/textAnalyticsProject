Bank holidays traditionally prompt hordes of Britons to head for Ikea to spend the mortgage equity they've built up over the past decade. So it was entirely appropriate that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown should choose the Croydon branch for a campaign visit this morning. (The PM ordered baked beans and bacon at the staff canteen. Mr Brown chose fruit salad, orange juice and a croissant, and tried to pay for both meals with a \u00a320 note, but was told they were on the house.) The theme of Labour's press conference this morning - interrupted by the news that another British soldier has been killed in Iraq - was the Lib Dems' and Conservatives' supposed economic incompetence. Peter Hain, campaigning in Blaenau Gwent, warned that Lib Dem protest votes could be as damaging to Labour as Ralph Nader supporters were to the Democrat cause in 2000. \"The truth is that here, as in America, the choice is not between the Labour government, for all its imperfections, and the progressive government of your dreams, but between the Labour government and the right-wing government of your nightmares,\" he said. The Lib Dems invited Greg Dyke, the BBC's former director general, to tell reporters why he was backing the party. \"I always wanted a centre-left government,\" he said, citing the Economist's endorsement of Labour as the best \"centre-right\" option. The Tories welcomed Coronation Street's Ken Barlow (aka William Roache) into their fold in Manchester. More on these stories &gt;&gt;&gt; WHO'S WHERE Tony Blair's whereabouts this afternoon remain confidential. He will be appearing on Jonathan Dimbleby's Ask Tony Blair tonight. Michael Howard will address a rally at ExCel in the London Docklands this afternoon. Charles Kennedy is visiting an arts centre for disabled people in Dorset. He will join the Lib Dem candidate for Taunton for a walkabout there this afternoon before doing the same in Frome. &gt;&gt;&gt; QUOTES OF THE DAY \"Your argument is that of the wifebeater who sneers at his wife: 'You won't leave me, 'cos you haven't got anywhere else to go'\" - The BBC's Mark Mardell questions Tony Blair during Labour's press conference. \"I am very, very confident about the outcome.\" - Michael Howard, asked whether the Conservatives are still 2-0 down with minutes to go until full time, says he leaves it to journalists to analyse the polls. \"If there was ever a tacit understanding in days gone by, and I am not sure about that, that is certainly terminated. Forget what the starting point might be. I don't think the last election is the most reliable guide to this election.\" - Charles Kennedy refuses to endorse a Labour vote in constituencies where the Lib Dems are in third place. &gt;&gt;&gt; WHAT THE PAPERS ARE SAYING FT: Jack Straw will probably keep his job.
