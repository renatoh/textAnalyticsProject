Ideas", "bodyText": "On Friday, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren co-sponsored a bill to impose mandatory fines on companies that have data breaches. It was the kind of consumer welfare legislation that in the past would have been unremarkable. But in an era when Congress has consistently shirked its duty to shield consumers, the bill stood out. The legislation capped a week in which Warren surged in the polls. Less than eight months before the Iowa caucus, Warren is making strides in 2020 primary polls. According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey of 1,000 adults, 64% of Democratic primary voters in June were enthusiastic or comfortable with Warren, compared with 57% in March. Fewer of these voters were enthusiastic or comfortable with Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, who have lost 11 and six points, respectively, since March. There\u2019s more. In a poll last week of 2,312 registered voters in South Carolina, Warren gained nine points to reach 17% compared to Biden\u2019s 37%. Among 18-34 year olds, Warren is leading 24% to Sanders\u2019 19% and Biden\u2019s 17%. There\u2019s a simple reason for Warren\u2019s sudden rise in the polls: the public has an appetite for policy. Of all the Democratic candidates, Warren\u2019s campaign has been by far the most ideas-driven and ambitious in its policy proposals. And voters love it. Rather than condescend to voters, like most politicians, Warren has treated voters as adults, smart enough to handle her wonky style of campaigning. Instead of spoon-feeding prospective voters soundbites, Warren is giving them heaps to digest \u2013 and her polling surge shows that voters appreciate the nerdy policy talk. Indeed, since Warren declared her candidacy for president, she has been offering policy prescriptions for our country\u2019s most pressing ailments \u2013 and she hasn\u2019t been brainstorming in a bubble. Week in and week out, she has been crisscrossing the country to tell receptive voters her ideas for an ultra-millionaire tax, student debt cancellation and breaking up big tech. She has also weighed in on reproductive rights, vaccines, the opioid crisis and algorithmic discrimination in automated loans. Her bevy of white papers demonstrates that there isn\u2019t a policy area Warren won\u2019t touch and she isn\u2019t worried about repelling anyone with hard-hitting proposals. Better than any other candidate, Warren has articulated a connection between her personal and professional struggles and her ideas, lending an air of authenticity to her campaign. Her backstory \u2013 teacher turned reluctant stay-at-home mom turned Harvard Law School professor \u2013 clearly resonates with voters in important states such as Iowa and South Carolina. That sense of reciprocity has turned Warren into a populist rock star. Instead of appealing to the lowest common denominator among the voting public, she\u2019s listening to and learning from voters in an ideas-driven campaign that doesn\u2019t take voters for granted. The strategy is paying off \u2013 and proving wrong the outdated political wisdom that Americans don\u2019t care about the intricacies of government. In May, Warren traveled to Kermit, West Virginia, the heart of Trump country, to pitch a $2.7bn-a-year plan to combat opioid addiction. \u201cHer stance is decisive and bold,\u201d Nathan Casian-Lakes told CBS News. \u201cShe has research and resources to back her ideas.\u201d Jill Priluck\u2019s reporting and analysis has appeared in the New Yorker, Slate, Reuters and elsewhere"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
