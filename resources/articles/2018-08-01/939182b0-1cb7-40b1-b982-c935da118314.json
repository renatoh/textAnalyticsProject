He becomes only the second Australian to win the prestigious prize, after Terence Tao in 2006. It is only awarded every four years to up to four mathematicians who are under 40. Venkatesh was recognised for his use of dynamics theory, which studies the equations of moving objects to solve problems in number theory, which is the study of whole numbers, integers and prime numbers. He grew up in Perth and, at 13, became the youngest person to study at the University of Western Australia, where he went straight into second-year maths courses after he proved he could write the exam papers for all the first-year subjects. He earned first-class honours in pure mathematics aged 16 \u2013 again the youngest to do so \u2013 before studying at Princeton. His work uses representation theory, which represents abstract algebra in terms of more easily-understood linear algebra, and topology theory, which studies the properties of structures that are deformed through stretching or twisting, like a M\u00f6bius strip. Speaking in 2016, he described his work as \u201clooking for new patterns in the arithmetic of numbers\u201d. Receiving his award on Thursday, he said: \u201cA lot of the time when you do math, you\u2019re stuck, but at the same time there are all these moments where you feel privileged that you get to work with it. \u201cYou have this sensation of transcendence, you feel like you\u2019ve been part of something really meaningful.\u201d Venkatesh, 36, now lives in the US and is a professor of mathematics at Stanford University. One of his early mentors, Prof Cheryl Praeger, said he had always been \u201cextraordinary\u201d. Praeger, a professor of mathematics at UWA and a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, has known Venkatesh since he was 12, and supervised his honours thesis when he was 15. \u201cAt our first meeting, I was speaking with Akshay\u2019s mother, Svetha, while Akshay was sitting at a table in my office reading my blackboard which contained fragments from a supervision of one of my PhD students. \u201cAt Akshay\u2019s request I explained what the problem was. He coped with quite a lot of detail and I found that he could easily grasp the essence of the research.\u201d This year\u2019s other winners of the Fields medal are Alessio Figalli from ETH Zurich in Switzerland, who is Italian, Caucher Birkar from Cambridge, a Kurdish man who came to Britain as a refugee, and Peter Scholze from Bonn University, who is German."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
