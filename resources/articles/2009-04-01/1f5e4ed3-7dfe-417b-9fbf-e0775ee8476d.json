Gordon Brown will hand over a Beckham-signed England shirt to the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, during a visit to the 2012 Olympic park in east London tomorrowon Friday. Rio de Janeiro is bidding to host the 2016 Olympic Games and Lula is seeing how London's site might provide tips for his own government-funded campaign. Brown's focus is to woo the president of one of the world's few still-growing major economies during the G20 summit in London but there are tangible benefits for England's 2018 World Cup bid, too. Although strategists' efforts to attract world leaders to last night's England game were thwarted by the simultaneous hosting of a royal banquet (while none also wanted to appear at a comparatively frivolous football match during the crisis talks) Lula will be targeted otherwise. Beckham has a football academy franchise on Brazilian soil and is an official ambassador for the England 2018 bid, although club commitments have prevented him from joining the party. Yet accompanying Brown around the site will be the London 2012 vice-chairman, Sir Keith Mills, who doubles as an England 2018 board member. Brazil's sports minister and the UK ambassador to Brazil are also touring Wembley, ahead of that nation's hosting of the 2014 World Cup, alongside the England 2018 chief executive, Andy Anson, and international strategist, Jane Bateman. Hopes are high that Brazil's 2018 votes will not now automatically head to Spain-Portugal's joint bid. Brussels battle beckons The Premier League's lobbyists in Brussels will reopen the bitter broadcast rights battle with the European Commission if Setanta collapses amid the economic crisis. The pay-tv broadcaster is undergoing a thorough internal review following the loss of one of its two top-flight football packages to Sky from the 2010-11 season and has given the league new guarantees of its continued survival. But any hopes of asking the league for a discount by taking advantage of a European regulatory regime that forbids monopoly coverage of English football have already been scotched. The league has told Setanta it will reopen the tender process while hoping to persuade the Commission to permit it to sell all six broadcast packages to the Sky operation. It is currently limited to five: enough, Setanta fears, to cause it serious subscription problems. Shearer's profits in tune Newcastle United has always been good to Alan Shearer who has agreed to take over as manager. Shearer is believed to be activating a clause in his BBC contract to take an unpaid break from his punditry duties, but he first moved to St James' Park a year after winning the 1995 title with Blackburn Rovers. That coincided with a lucrative period for Shearer Promotions Ltd, as analysis of company accounts proves. While at Ewood Park, Shearer's company was worth between \u00a316,000 and \u00a340,000 - less than a week's wages to a 21st-century Premier League footballer. But with Shearer's agent having registered his name as a trademark in July 1996, and with Shearer Promotions receiving \u00a31.2m of property for directors' disposal during the year to October 1998, the money was soon rolling in. Twelve months later its net value had leapt to \u00a3400,000, with the most recently available accounts (to October 2007) showing its fortunes did not suffer in the 12 months after his retirement as a player, when the company was still worth almost \u00a31m. Lego bridge-building Thirty commercial directors from Football League clubs visit Legoland today. The trip is the brainchild of Mark Bradley who advises the league on its family excellence awards. He hopes clubs learn how the benefits of family attractions could be replicated for fans. They might hope the executives get lost in Loki's Labyrinth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
