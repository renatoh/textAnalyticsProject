The boy's sister runs alongside, her face braced in anguish. This was the image that disgusted the world when, on 16 June 1976, apartheid police opened fire on protesting school children in Soweto, the biggest black township in South Africa. Today that image of a fatally wounded 12-year-old, Hector Pieterson, greets visitors to a museum bearing his name. Tourists can take \"township tours\" and walk along Vilakazi Street which, guides are fond of pointing out, is the only one in the world with the homes of two Nobel peace prize winners \u2013 Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The date 16 June has been honoured ever since, but residents of Soweto will have something else on their minds and TV screens when the day falls in 2010: South Africa versus Uruguay in the World Cup. The streets that once ran with blood are now bedecked with the flags of competing nations. A generation after students joined the Soweto uprising, today's young people are wearing Bafana Bafana shirts and playing football in the park. Pekwa All Stars are a young team in Soweto's thriving amateur leagues, where teams enjoy unlikely names such as Pimville Cameroon, Woodpeckers and Emdeni Naughty Boys. Some of their members are so poor they go to school on an empty stomach. None can afford a match ticket for Africa's first World Cup. But don't try telling them it is a bad idea. \"The World Cup has brought many things like infrastructure,\" Pacific Nkosi, 18, said, wearing slippers on the grass at Dorothy Nyembe Park in Dobsonville, where groups of young players are practising near goalposts. \"There were potholes in the road over there but not now. There are job opportunities: people have been employed because of the World Cup. Even the crime rate is better because more police have been employed.\" Football is an important outlet for Nkosi and others in Soweto which, despite social and economic growth since the end of white minority rule in 1994, remains a place of limited opportunity for an estimated two million population living in squat but proud brick houses or rudimentary tin shacks. \"Football is a great sport because we interact with people,\" Nkosi continued. \"You can share with your team-mates. If you have financial problems, your team-mates will help you.\" Nkosi, who shares a room with his brother in a hostel, cannot afford a World Cup ticket so will watch on TV. \"It's disappointing,\" he admitted. \"I'd like to watch a match live in one of the stadiums.\" Despite this, Pekwa All Stars \u2013 motto \"One for all, all for one,\" \u2013 are adamant that sport's greatest show will have a lasting benefit for them and their community. Tshepo Maseko, 21, the assistant coach, said: \"It's a good feeling. We have learned a lot of things and achieved a lot of things. Our community has developed and we have a lot of opportunities, like being young entrepreneurs. The World Cup has improved our economy and transport \u2013 there are buses, taxis, trains.\" Maseko, whose favourite players are Kak\u00e1 and Lionel Messi, pointed into the distance. \"There's another small stadium being developed over there now. There are also two new fields for soccer and rugby and a swimming pool and tennis courts. All these have been developed new.\" One of the major World Cup projects in Soweto is a new bus network aimed at plugging a long neglected gap in public transport. But not everyone is happy: the system has been fiercely resisted by the owners of minibus taxis who see it as a threat to their business. Some buses have even come under gunfire, resulting in death and injury. Soweto's Orlando Stadium has been redeveloped but will not host World Cup matches. The opening ceremony and game, and the final, will be played at Soccer City which, strictly speaking, lies neither in Soweto nor Johannesburg but in a no man's land in between. Its location is a poignant legacy of the spatial apartheid that saw black people banished from cities and forced to live in townships out of sight and out of the minds of whites. For teenagers who live and breathe football, the prospect of the world's best players coming to their doorstep is breathtaking \u2013 an opportunity to reach for the stars, however remote. Mandla Khambule, 17, who plays left-back for the team, lives with his mother in a house where eight people share four rooms; his father has died. \"Life is difficult,\" he said. \"I don't have money to eat lunch. I found it difficult growing up \u2013 I didn't see a way forward. But now with this team I do. People who come here will see soccer is a way of life.\" Asked about his career ambitions after school, Khambule replied: \"My dream is to be a minister of finance one day. Or play for Bafana Bafana.\" Sizwe Mtshali, 19, a defender, is unemployed. \"I struggle. The problem is my parents don't have enough money to send me to school. You have to eat and dress. I'm trying to get my driver's licence.\" But he too is optimistic about the legacy of the World Cup. \"It's a great thing to see top players from other countries playing and South Africa is going to benefit. In Soweto they have developed streets, parks and stadiums and some people have even got jobs. It's time Africa hosted the World Cup. It's a beautiful country.\" South Africa has described the World Cup as its most important national moment since the end of apartheid and the election of Nelson Mandela as its first black president. Soweto was at the heart of the liberation struggle that made possible the country's return from global pariah status \u2013 and ultimately its place this year at the centre of the sporting world. Football was a political weapon against the apartheid regime. In the 50s, South Africans of all races formed the South African Soccer Federation and mounted a campaign to force the expulsion of the South African FA from Fifa. The pressure for boycotts, with the mantra \"No normal sports for an abnormal society,\" probably helped turn white public opinion. Just as in working-class Britain, football was a part of Soweto culture. Orlando Pirates, born in 1937, became a rallying point of social solidarity and self-worth. The Pirates and their arch rivals, Kaiser Chiefs, still have fanatical followings not just in Soweto but all over the country. The \"Soweto derby\" remains the must-see game wherever it is played. Oshebeng Alphie Koonyaditse, author of The Politics of South African Football, said: \"Football here is like second religion. It sounds like a rather extreme comparison but people here love the game. Teams like Chiefs and Pirates are brands in their own right, at least in the region given the support they enjoy in neighbouring countries. Football gave people hope. Back in 1973 the all white team played against the all black team \u2013 the aim really was to defy government policies but importantly to prove that integrated football was a possibility.\" Ever since South Africa was awarded the World Cup six years ago, its organisers have faced accusations that the event will service only tourists and the middle-class, with the huge investment excluding millions of poor black people still living in shacks without jobs or basic services. But Danny Jordaan, the head of the organising committee, dismisses the notion that sport should remain the preserve of the rich. \"Africa is entitled to all experiences and all events,\" he said. \"The World Cup has been an experience that we pursued so no one must question, begrudge that fact we are hosting our first World Cup on African soil. \"If you want to raise the social issue, ask them, ask those football fans who have no houses, no job. Ask them, 'Do you want the World Cup in this country?' You'll hear an overwhelming yes because that is the lifeblood, that is the generator of hope, that is what puts a smile on many African faces. That is important on the continent. Football is a giver of hope and life and we must never argue that we must deny the fundamental pleasure and joy that football can bring. Football is the one expression where Africans can compete equally with anyone in the world.\" Read the first part of our four-part series"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
