Extreme sports. It gives you a good reason to travel and means you're not like a regular tourist with a camera going to look at a bit of architecture. You get to see the real country by going to explore cave systems or climb rocks out in the middle of the jungle. It's really cool. When I'm travelling I always miss... Bear, a teddy bear I've had all my life. A friend of mine just shot its ear off which really pissed me off. My idea of paradise is... An amazing beach with rock-climbing right on it. Thailand is great by Railay Bay - but it's almost 100 per cent humidity and even the water's too warm to cool off in. Family holidays... Were to Hawaii. It was kind of cool but when you become a teenager and you've been there 40 times it starts to feel a bit like Groundhog Day My favourite hotels are... The Beverly Hills Hotel, the Dorchester and the Four Seasons on Maui. They call you by your first name and you can get away with anything. We lived at the Beverly Hills for about six months once, but living in a hotel is a bit of a pain. It's like an apartment, but with more regulations and the menu never changes. I'll never go back to... India. I went to Mumbai for a week but let's just say it was a little too raw for me. My ideal travelling companion is... Craig, the producer of my show. He's just really funny. He tends to get really wasted on the plane - drinking 17 or 18 miniature bottles of wine - and then has these heart-to-hearts with you. My last trip was to... The Yosemite National Park, climbing with friends. We camped out for about 10 days, did the whole backwoods thing and climbed every day. I like to travel... First class if I'm by myself. I'm very much a five-star all the way kind of guy. But if I'm going with a bunch of friends, I'll gladly sit at the back of the plane. The last person i sat next to on a plane was... An absolute psychopath. We were on a Virgin plane and he kept yelling at the stewardesses that BA was much better because he couldn't find the headphone socket. I ended up moving seats. My most memorable meal was in... Belize. We went to this little roadside hut where they serve their version of tacos. We just sat on the side of the road eating these things. Then someone threatened to kill my friend and it all got kind of interesting... \u00b7 Jack Osbourne's autobiography 21 Years Gone, published by Macmillan, \u00a316.99, is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
