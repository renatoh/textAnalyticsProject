Having chosen nursing as a plunge into \u201creal life\u201d after A-levels, I was terrified of what might face me and was so lucky to have been held steady by her reassuring strength and compassion. Beyond the necessary rules and the rigid hierarchy of nursing, her intelligence and sense of humour made one feel that she saw things in perspective. She inspired confidence throughout the ward and was not afraid to challenge doctors if she thought they were unfair. Her example stayed with me through my training."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
