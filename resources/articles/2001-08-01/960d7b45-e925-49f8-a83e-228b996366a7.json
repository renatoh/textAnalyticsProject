There we were, pupils who had been sent to Summerhill in the 1920s through to those who arrived with the new millennium. There was much reminiscing about games on the old beech tree with its sweeping swing, of impromptu music in the main hall and maths lessons where our teacher abandoned sums to read us Dickens. We remembered the feeling of knowing adults were on your side, wanting us to have fun with our childhood, and of the aggravation of teachers who weren't up to teaching us properly because pedagogic qualifications were ignored in favour of what were deemed the right human qualities. I particularly remember the science teacher who displayed his lack of inhibitions by parading naked with his dog along the top corridor, but was useless in the lab. We were gathered in the battered Victorian house, set in several acres of overgrown grounds in Leiston, Suffolk, which has been Summerhill's home since 1927. But the school was actually founded in 1921 by A. S. Neill and his first wife, Lilian Neustatter (my grandmother), in the village of Hellerau, outside Dresden - and only there after he had scoured Europe looking for a country prepared to let him put into practice ideas which were a radical reversal of the still popular Victorian notion that children were intrinsically bad and needed teaching to be good. Many saw Neill and his ideas as radical seducers of children's minds. Neill believed passionately that children were good and would thrive if given freedom and a democratic community. His community was one where boys and girls could mix without inhibition, where kids could choose not to go to lessons and play all day if they wished, where they could never wash and swear like troopers. And where the voice and vote of tiddlers equalled Neill's at the weekly school meeting, which still takes place on a Saturday evening and where they could truly learn about how to live democratically. For most schools, change is the essence of progress, but to Zoe Redhead, A. S.Neill's daughter and headteacher for the past 16 years, \"children are made as unhappy by the rigidity and repressiveness imposed on them by ordinary schools and by not being allowed to express themselves as they ever were. \"Where else do you find the unconditional freedom Neill wanted kids to have, where they really can have a happy, free experience of growing up which allows them to live the lives they want - not lives of pressure designed to please adults. \"Look around you and see what terrible things people brought up in conventional ways are doing, the amount of unhappiness there is, and then tell me we don't still need a better way for people to learn to live.\" It's a view given added weight by the battle Redhead faced last year when the Labour government - the only one ever to do it - decided on the basis of a damning report that it would close Summerhill on the grounds that it was not adequately equipping children to live constructive lives. A team of academics, convened by Professor Ian Cunningham, compiled an independent report which showed that the report's criticisms were \"unjustified and unjustifiable. The report said children would be adversely affected in pursuing future careers, but they had not bothered to check with past pupils,\" Cunningham said. \"We concluded that Summerhill had every right to go on existing.\" The High Court agreed and the government was seen off. \"That was a watershed,\" Redhead says. \"We really had to look at Summerhill and question ourselves about what we were doing, and why, and we came away more convinced than ever that we should not be intimidated into adapting and diluting our ideas. So obviously this anniversary is more of a celebration than usual.\" But, in the end, the best way of understanding the point of Summerhill and whether it works is through the experiences of former pupils. Time and again, pupils - such as Penny Anderson, 39, assistant to a Channel 4 director, who went to the school aged 10 in 1972 after a very regimented private school - recall lessons as something they often chose not to go to. \"I don't think I went to any at first and I do remember my mother worried, but I'd been so put off studying by the curriculum forced on me at my last school,\" Penny says. \"I started wandering into the art room and my confidence grew from doing things I liked and was good at. In the end I went to some classes because I was curious to find out what they were like and I ended up doing GCSEs in several subjects, including biology and art.\" All these ex-pupils, like Chino Osuka, 29, who was sent from Japan in 1982 at the age of 10 to 16 because her parents so disliked the Japanese way of education, have demonstrated the validity of Neill's belief that, given freedom, children will learn what they want and need when they are ready. She may have horrified her parents with her dyed hair, pierced ear and endless chatter about Duran Duran, but she got herself into art college and then the Royal College of Art to do a postgraduate degree in photography from which she now makes her living. There is an exhibition with her work at the Victoria and Albert museum in September. In every generation there are academics and professionals; doctors and teachers, architects, illustrators and musicians. Of my generation there is someone making it big in the music business, a now middle-aged whizz in the City who was a delinquent menace for many of his school years, a psychotherapist, a truck driver and a couple of people who are casual about what work they do. Some feel they have contented lives even if their jobs are lowly, others feel they have done less than they might have. Certainly one of the criticisms made of Summerhill by its pupils, as Jonathan Croall notes in his fine biography Neill of Summerhill - the Permanent Rebel, is that they wanted better and more teaching than Neill, who attached small importance to formal learning, organised. On one occasion a group of academically able pupils requested more lessons and when Neill refused they called a special meeting and carried the proposal by a large majority. These days Summerhill pupils choose to take GCSEs and, in some cases, A-levels. But Neill's wish was to be judged by the happiness of his pupils, and many of us who were there remember the extraordinary way children who arrived desperately unhappy, disturbed and wildly disruptive and destructive, calmed down into social minded, sweet-natured kids once they had run amok, tested everyone's patience, broken things and been ordered by their peers to mend them. In the end, Summerhill is a tiny school which is full to capacity right now with 75 children from many parts of the world. Yet Neill's influence has been tremendous. His books are translated into more than 20 languages, there are schools modelled on Summerhill around the globe and Neill's educational ideas have been absorbed into state teacher training even though they are not currently in favour. And in the view of Croall, it is vital the school goes on boldly and determinedly towards its centenary: \"Summerhill is leading the way in teaching children about citizenship and taking responsibility for themselves. \"This is still probably the only school to go on testing out the possibilities of freedom with children in a way that is not possible in the rigid state system.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
