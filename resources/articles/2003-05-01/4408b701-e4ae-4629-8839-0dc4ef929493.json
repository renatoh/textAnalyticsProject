Philip Weston (92), Craig Spearman (89) and Tim Hancock (82) were the main contributors to a 45-over total of 311 for four, the highest score Gloucestershire have made in the competition at their County Ground. Leicestershire's miserable start to the campaign continued as they were bowled out for 254 to go down by 57 runs, despite a sparkling 90 off 64 balls from their captain Phil DeFreitas and 65 from Darren Stevens. Martin Bicknell and Jimmy Ormond held their nerve to guide Surrey to a thrilling one-wicket win over Worcestershire at New Road. The visitors needed 245 to win and started well with Ali Brown (81) and Mark Ramprakash sharing in a superb second-wicket stand of 153. But a flurry of wickets saw them slip from 209 for three to 239 for nine before the final pair saw Surrey home. The defending champions Glamorgan coasted to their second victory in 24 hours - following Sunday's win over Leicestershire at Grace Road by 44 runs - when they overwhelmed Kent at Cardiff by seven wickets with eight overs and four balls to spare. Their acting captain Robert Croft - in the absence of the injured Steve James - played a starring role as he took three wickets for 33 in a nine-over spell and hit a useful 59 playing at the top of the order. In the Second Division the Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq put on a powerful display to help Middlesex scramble a last-ball victory over Hampshire at the Rose Bowl. Razzaq struck 20 in an over from Shaun Udal - including three sixes - as Middlesex surged to an unexpected four-wicket win. Phil Jaques continued his fine start to the season with a third successive half-century as Northamptonshire made it three wins out of three with a win over Sussex at Hove. The Australian fired 68 and Jeff Cook made 49 as the visitors, chasing a target of 218, clinched victory by four wickets with two balls to spare."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
