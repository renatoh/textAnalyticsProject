The fight, at the Cardiff International Arena, could be the most searching examination of the Welshman's credentials since he beat Chris Eubank to win the World Boxing Organisation version of the title more than four years ago. Calzaghe may not like the term but he is something of a homeboy. Still trained by his father, Enzo, in the Newbridge gym where he began and never happier than when fighting before those he sees as his own, the 30-year-old champion can be a reluctant sporting star. But boxing's mandarins would have it otherwise. Calzaghe's British reputation is assured. In nine title defences his form has not always been inspirational, yet he has found a way to maintain a 32-fight undefeated professional record and the publicseems convinced. The project now is transatlantic fame. However, he must first find a way past Brewer. The 32-year-old from Philadelphia needed two attempts to make the 12st limit in yesterday's weigh-in but still believes he can emerge victorious. With a record of 37 wins and eight defeats, he was good enough to hold the International Boxing Federation version of the title before losing a couple of questionable decisions to the German Sven Ottke. Brewer's performance in his 1998 defence against Herol Graham in Atlantic City, when he twice got off the canvas before ending the Sheffield veteran's challenge with a series of heavy blows in the 10th round, amply illustrated his fighting heart and Brewer has always prospered on the back of his puncher's reputation. \"I'm like a kid in a candy store,\" he said. \"As far as I'm concerned, I'm the best super-middleweight in the world and now I will get the chance to prove it. Joe Calzaghe and his camp made a wrong decision in choosing me. But the American's words do not overly concern the self-confident Calzaghe.\"He may be fancying this but he's never been able to take a shot too well. Herol Graham had him down and I can punch harder than Graham. \"I know Brewer's tough and I can't take nothing to chance. I'm not just up for winning, I'm up for winning in style. It's about making a statement that will go worldwide. He says I throw fast punches without power. Well, we'll see.\" Calzaghe may have his own resistance tested but is likely to get the win he needs to enhance his reputation prior to a planned American debut later in the year. Meanwhile, at the Wembley Conference Centre, Harrison should take another step forward by beating Long, whose record of six wins and one defeat record does not stand up to close scrutiny. Of his six victims not one had previously mustered a single victory. Long, with his size 20 feet and 85-inch reach, may be the tallest ever to set foot in a British ring and he says he will knock Harrison out. If he does, the Olympic champion's best laid plans will look ludicrous but logic suggests Harrison will collect a facile fourth victory. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
