When Davinson S\u00e1nchez arrived at Tottenham in August for a fee of up to \u00a342m, most headlines simply noted that at last Spurs had bought someone, anyone, after a summer of inactivity. Three months later, however, and that fee now seems significant because it is starting to look like a bargain. The 21-year-old Colombian centre\u2011half has taken to the upper echelons of club football with an ease as graceful as his running style. It was his S\u00e1nchez on S\u00e1nchez tackle that led to the free-kick which opened the scoring in last Saturday\u2019s north London derby. But it was not a foul. Holding off the Chilean, Davinson reached his long leg around his opponent to scoop the ball away. He was Tottenham\u2019s most composed defender on an unexpectedly torrid afternoon and carried that performance into midweek where he won his duel with Dortmund\u2019s feted striker Pierre\u2011Emerick Aubameyang. S\u00e1nchez combines imperious physicality with impeccable pace, but most striking is his composure. For someone so young, though the defender\u2019s single previous season in European football was a marquee one at Ajax, he never seems ruffled. He is able to read a defensive situation effectively and choose the appropriate means to deal with it. His role model, one he acquired after involved YouTube study, is Franco Baresi. You can understand why. Yes, he makes mistakes; Aubameyang ghosted behind him to turn Andriy Yarmolenko\u2019s glorious backheel past Hugo Lloris for the opening goal on Tuesday. But he has not made many and his manager, Mauricio Pochettino, looked pleased at being finally able to wax lyrical about his acquisition. \u201cI am so happy with him,\u201d Pochettino said before Saturday\u2019s Premier League encounter with West Bromwich Albion. \u201cHe is doing well, very well. He\u2019s only 21 years old but he is more mature than that. In only a few months, he\u2019s showing he can do a fantastic job for us. \u201cYou see against Dortmund how many times he was with Aubameyang one v one. Or look against Swansea against Tammy Abraham, or Real Madrid against Cristiano Ronaldo. How many central defenders can play one v one and escape? How many players can be tight and press and think \u2018If you run, I run\u2019 because they are so confident in their running? Not many centre-backs in the world can do this. But we expect more from him. He\u2019s one of the best today, but there is massive potential for him to improve.\u201d For his manager those areas of potential include, well, everything. \u201cTactical, physical condition, technique, every single aspect because he\u2019s still very young,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cHe arrived late in the transfer market and with no proper pre-season because he was playing in the qualification for the national team in Colombia. He had no time to work with us. We need one month and a half or two months\u2019 pre-season with him and then I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to show a different level.\u201d S\u00e1nchez\u2019s career to this early point has been action-packed. He has made 16 appearances for Tottenham this season, and played 45 times for Ajax as they finished runners-up in the Dutch and Europa League. Before that, as a 19-year-old, he won the Copa Libertadores with his boyhood club Atl\u00e9tico Nacional of Medellin. That season he learned his trade as a defender having passed through the Nacional youth system in midfield. Asked why S\u00e1nchez has adjusted to the rigours of the Premier and Champions League so quickly, Pochettino said: \u201cBecause he\u2019s so clever, very humble and he\u2019s very open to learn. \u201cHe\u2019s a player that when you tell him something his reaction is to be open and be critical with himself. That is a massive skill for a player, when he\u2019s so open to improve\u201d. If S\u00e1nchez continues the progress he has made in each year of his career so far, Pochettino is confident his name will feature in many more headlines yet. \u201cHe has the opportunity to be one of the best centre-halves in the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
