The Eton-educated Lord Cottesloe, admittedly, is not a fashionable figure for today; he is described in Peter Hall's diaries as a Bentley-driving, \"Polonius-like\" figure. But, as chairman of the Arts Council, he was a real mover behind the creation of the National Theatre. His name will be given to an adjoining public room, and presumably, in time, quietly forgotten."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
