Tindall had just led Gloucester to a Premiership double over their West Country rivals Bath, his former club, and created their try with a midfield break that saw him stopped just short of the line by Olly Woodburn. His contract at Kingsholm is up at the end of the season and he is in talks about a new one. Redpath said after Tindall, who was dropped from England's elite squad last month, returned from the World Cup in October that he hoped to resolve the centre's future by the end of January but talks are set to move into next month, with Gloucester looking for a one-year renewal while Tindall, who has been linked with a move to Biarritz, wants two. \"We agreed a new deal with Mike in March last year and there is no issue with timing,\" said Redpath. \"There is no great rush. We have to make the right decision for Gloucester.Mike has been a loyal servant to English rugby with Bath and Gloucester and he still has something to offer.\" Gloucester have a number of young centres in their squad, Henry Trinder, Jonny May and Ryan Mills will be supplemented by the arrival next season of Billy Twelvetrees, but Tindall, who will be 34 in October, provides experience. It was the mixture of youthful spirit and knowhow that took them to victory over Bath on Saturday and into the top half of the table. When an early brawl broke out, they needed no second invitation to take part. Gloucester are putting a run together, one defeat in their last five Premiership outings, and their next two matches, at home to Harlequins on Saturday and away to Leicester the following week, will go some way to laying down their play-off credentials. \"We are in the middle of a big four games,\" said Redpath. \"We have beaten Northampton and Bath and Harlequins are next up. We are due a performance against them that gives us some reward \u2013 the grunt at forward we showed in difficult conditions on Saturday took us to victory.\" Bath are only seven points behind Gloucester, but a top-half finish looks unlikely, never mind making the play-offs. It was their fourth home league defeat of the season and despite taking the lead with a neatly worked try by Tom Biggs and then pulling level on the hour, they were flattered by the final scoreline. Conditions were difficult, especially in a rainswept first-half, but Bath lacked Gloucester's quality and when they had the chance to salvage a draw or better from the final move of the match, they messed up a line-out. They are almost as close to the bottom club Newcastle as they are to Northampton in third. \"We have a number of injuries and are having to pick our 23 for a match from 24 players,\" said the Bath director of rugby, Ian McGeechan. They are reported to have withdrawn their interest in the Wales and Lions prop Gethin Jenkins, who could have been their marquee signing for next season. At the moment, there is nothing more marquee about Bath than the canvas flapping at the side of the pitch in Saturday's wind.
