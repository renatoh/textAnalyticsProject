Some pundits think Paris is creeping ahead, but William Hill still places London as the frontrunner to host the Games. The bid proposals are tied in with plans to regenerate undeveloped areas in the east of the capital in the Lower Lea Valley area. The official venue plans are expected to be announced later this week. Manchester's successful hosting of the Commonwealth Games in 2002 has boosted the UK's reputation as a competition venue. However, continuing uncertainty over the future of London's Wembley stadium is a potential achilles heel, as is London's outdated transport system. Odds: 6/4 Paris Paris is well-served with world class venues and has an advantage that its Games would all be relatively central, providing the \"compact\" venue that organisers have asked for. The centrepiece would be the 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the country's World Cup football triumph in 1998. A media centre and swimming pool are planned close by with an Olympic village in the central, 17th arrondissement. France also won plaudits for its successful hosting of the 1998 World Cup. Odds: 7/4 Madrid The mayor of Madrid, Alberto Ruiz-Gallard\u00f3n, has emphasised the \"concentration and proximity\" of venues in Spain's capital and the city's good transport system. The planned Olympic village would be a five-minute drive from the airport. But environmental campaign group Ecologistas en Acci\u00f3n claims Madrid is the most polluted city in Europe and not suitable to host the Games. Also, Barcelona hosted the 1992 Games and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) may consider this an indecent period of time to have elapsed before giving a second Spanish city the chance to host the Games. Odds: 11/2 New York New York has never hosted an Olympic bid or a Games. The city's bid is the most expensive of all nine, at a proposed $3.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) and would require the extension of several subway lines. The Games venue would be shaped in the form of an X, with the Olympic village at the intersection, on undeveloped land along the East River in the Queens district of the city. Vancouver's successful bid to host the 2010 winter Games might not dispose the IOC to site two consecutive Games on the same continent. Meanwhile, widespread criticism of US foreign policy has created tensions with European countries, which could also count against the US winning the bid. Odds: 9/1 Rio de Janeiro The centrepiece of Rio's bid is the Est\u00e1dio Ol\u00edmpico Jo\u00e3o Havelange, already under construction for the 2007 Pan American Games. The stadium, which is due to be completed by 2005, has a capacity of 45,000, but if the city does win the bid, this will be expanded. Legal wrangles between local and federal government, however, have cast something of a cloud over the building of the stadium. Odds: 10/1 Moscow Russia, which during the Soviet period had a world-beating reputation for athletics, still has formidable track and field sportsmen and women, and hosted a successful Olympics in 1980. A venue would be a PR coup for President Vladimir Putin, who has thrown his support wholeheartedly behind it. But, despite Moscow's good infrastructure, Russia is still beset by crippling economic problems, and recent terrorist attacks by Chechen and other separatist groups will increase security concerns. Odds: 16/1 Leipzig Leipzig's bid has suffered from a lack of leadership. The former Olympic swimming champion Michael Gross turned down an offer to head the city's bid last year. This followed the resignation of Dirk Thaerichen, the former managing director, after revelations that he had served in a guard unit of communist East Germany's dreaded secret police, the Stasi. Meanwhile, long shadows are still cast by Germany's two previous Games, in Berlin in 1936 and in Munich in 1972, which were marred by politics. Adolf Hitler turned the 1936 Games into a propaganda coup for the Nazis and the 1972 Games were the venue for the murder of several Israeli athletes by terrorists. Odds: 16/1 Istanbul This is Istanbul's fourth consecutive bid for the Games. The city has allocated 580 hectares (1,430 acres) of land for the Games and is building a 22,000-seat athletic arena. But the lack of a designated stadium could cause problems for the city. One 80,000-seat stadium, built for the 2008 bid, has been sitting empty due to poor road links. The Olympic committee has done a deal with the football club Galatasary, allowing it to rent their studio for at least two seasons while the club builds a new venue. Odds: 50/1 Havana The IOC has stressed that Cuba is in with as good a chance as any of the other nine bidders. But the Caribbean country's economic problems and poor relations between the communist government and the US will not stand in its favour. Nevertheless, Cuba's sporting prowess in track and field sports is legendary, and its vigorous bid has been praised by several high profile UK sports stars.
