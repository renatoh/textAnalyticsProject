The prime minister \u2013 who employed the former NoW editor Andy Coulson as his press spokesman \u2013 said he was shocked. The chief executive of News International \u2013 who was editing the paper at the time \u2013 said she was sickened. The chair of the Press Complaints Commission, which has wrung its hands for two years, said she was angry. The Labour party leader called on Rebekah Brooks to resign. The Lib Dems' president asked whether Rupert Murdoch was a \"fit and proper person\" to own any more of the media market. The Tory peer Lord Fowler called for a public inquiry. Meanwhile advertisers began to boycott the newspaper and thousands of people flocked to sign an online petition to stop the imminent Murdoch takeover of BSkyB. This is obviously a crisis for one particular company. It is a crisis of press regulation. And it is a crisis which touches on many other areas of public life, including policing, the privileges of parliament and media plurality. There are four separate but connected strands to the developing saga. The first concerns the governance of News International at a time when the company is asking the secretary of state to allow it to become quite easily the most dominant media company this country has ever seen. Rebekah Brooks refused to resign on Tuesday, announcing that she was determined to stay on to investigate herself. This would be comic if it were not so serious. The second concerns the future of the Press Complaints Commission. We warned in November 2009 that the PCC's cursory and complacent response to the Guardian's phone-hacking allegations would be damaging to the cause of self-regulation, and so it has proved. The credibility of the organisation is currently hanging by a thread. The third strand relates to the growing pressure for a public inquiry which will get to the bottom of all the issues, including why the police closed down the inquiry in 2006, never informing the thousands of potential victims \u2013 who included politicians, intelligence officers and the police themselves \u2013 that they might have been targeted. But, most urgently, there is the decision which the culture secretary must take in relation to the BSkyB takeover. Jeremy Hunt ignored the obvious initial route \u2013 which would have been to pass the matter straight to the Competition Commission, as he was advised to do by the media regulator Ofcom. Instead, he chose to enter into tortuous negotiations with News International over the governance and independence of Sky News, which was never the main issue. He protests that his hands are tied by the legal advice he has received on plurality matters. Until this week it looked inevitable that he would wave the merger through. The problem is that a significant majority of people in this country are opposed to the merger: it simply doesn't pass the commonsense \"bad smell\" test. So Mr Hunt should simply put the decision on ice. He should say that it is inconceivable that he should currently approve the creation of a giant media entity in this country while there are so many unanswered questions about the criminal behaviour of its employees and about the governance of the company. The people at the head of News International are the same people who paid hush money to conceal evidence of criminality within their own company and who led a news organisation which \u2013 according to the PCC chair, Peta Buscombe \u2013 lied to the regulator. Mr Hunt should announce a pause while we see who, if anyone, is charged with what offences. By doing so, he would, of course, open himself to the possibility of judicial review by News International. After the Milly Dowler affair it would take some nerve on the part of the company to dare to do so. \u2022 The following was published on 12 December 2011 in the corrections and clarifications column: An article about the investigation into the abduction and death of Milly Dowler (News of the World hacked Milly Dowler's phone during police hunt, 5 July, page 1) stated that voicemail \"messages were deleted by [NoW] journalists in the first few days after Milly's disappearance in order to free up space for more messages. As a result friends and relatives of Milly concluded wrongly that she might still be alive.\" Since this story was published new evidence \u2013 as reported in the Guardian of 10 December \u2013 has led the Metropolitan police to believe that this was unlikely to have been correct and that while the News of the World hacked Milly Dowler's phone the newspaper is unlikely to have been responsible for the deletion of a set of voicemails from the phone that caused her parents to have false hopes that she was alive, according to a Metropolitan police statement made to the Leveson inquiry on 12 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
