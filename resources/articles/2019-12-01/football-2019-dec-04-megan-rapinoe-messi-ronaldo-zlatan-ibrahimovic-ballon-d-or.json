Rapinoe won the Ballon d\u2019Or, recognising her as the best women\u2019s player in the year, earlier this week. Messi won the men\u2019s award for a record sixth time. As well as her achievements on the field \u2013 she won her second World Cup with the US this summer \u2013 Rapinoe is a powerful voice away from football. She has spoken out against racism, sexism and homophobia. She was also the first white professional athlete to kneel for the US national anthem, joining Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protest against racial and social injustice in the United States. \u201cI want to shout: \u2018Cristiano [Ronaldo], Lionel [Messi], Zlatan [Ibrahimovic], help me!\u2019\u201d she told France Football, the organisers of the Ballon d\u2019Or. \u201cThese big stars do not engage in anything when there are so many problems in men\u2019s football. Do they fear losing everything? They believe that, but it is not true. Who will erase Messi or Ronaldo from world football history for a statement against racism or sexism?\u201d After Napoli\u2019s Kalidou Koulibaly suffered racist abuse during a game against Internazionale last season, Ronaldo posted a message on Instagram saying \u201cNo to racism and any offense &amp; discrimination\u201d, while Ibrahimovic, whose father is Muslim, has said he has been a victim of Islamaphobia. Messi is notoriously reluctant to say anything to the media beyond events on the field. None of the three can be compared to Rapinoe in terms of activism. Indeed, Ibrahimovic sparked controversy in 2013 when he spoke about Sweden\u2019s women\u2019s team. \u201cWith all respect for what the ladies have done, and they\u2019ve done it fantastically well, you can\u2019t compare men\u2019s and women\u2019s football,\u201d he said. \u201cGive it up, it\u2019s not even funny.\u201d Rapinoe acknowledged that her reward may have partly been a recognition of her work as a voice for change. \u201cThis Ballon d\u2019Or rewards both,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the one hand, I am a good player. On the other, my activity away from the pitch brings me support as people understand I am acting to find solutions to our society\u2019s problems. The idea is to empower others to speak louder.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
