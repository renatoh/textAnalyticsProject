The High Court yesterday heard Sugar, who is selling two-thirds of his majority shareholding, agree that he had made a profit of nearly \u00a320m during his stewardship. Sugar, 53, also agreed that it would be no exaggeration to say he had a \"massive\" personal fortune - with that \u00a320m representing less than 10% of his net worth. He was continuing his evidence in his libel case over an article in the Daily Mail in December 1999 calling him \"miserly\" in his reign. He became heated as he sparred with Nicholas Stadlen QC, defending, who suggested that Sugar could personally afford the money to spend on players for Spurs if he chose. But Sugar retorted that Viscount Rothermere, owner of Associated Newspapers, was also capable of buying the Daily Mail a new printing press but it was unlikely that the newspaper would ask him to \"bung us a few quid\". \"It's absolutely ludicrous to suggest something like that. \"Do they say to Richard Branson, lend us a few quid to buy us a new plane?\" Sugar said that about \u00a3100m had been spent on players and White Hart Lane in his time and he agreed that the bank would \"most probably\" have loaned him \u00a37.5m to buy Dennis Bergkamp, but Tottenham's then manager Gerry Francis had vetoed the idea. Sugar agreed he could have doubled the \u00a312m budget that George Graham, his current manager, was initially given. \"The board wanted to restrict the activities within what it could afford to do,\" he said. \"What is the point of putting the company into debt?\" Sugar, who invested \u00a38.5m in the club in 1991, is selling shares for \u00a322m and keeping a stake worth \u00a36.5m. He said he and his family were \"passionate\" Spurs supporters and that he had not bought the club to make money for himself. He blamed his three previous managers for Spurs' lack of success. Stadlen asked: \"It's the managers' fault?\" Sugar replied: \"It ain't mine. I don't kick the balls, do I? Who else's fault is it?\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
