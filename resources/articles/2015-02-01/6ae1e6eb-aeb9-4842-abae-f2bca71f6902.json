Pearson\u2019s evening cannot have been easy but, the way he described it, the chaos surrounding the club did not impact on a very average Sunday. \u201cMy cat was sitting on my knee all afternoon, I was like Blofeld,\u201d said Pearson. \u201cI spent the day at home. There was a Canadian folk band at the Greystones pub. They weren\u2019t very good.\u201d That was the serene scene that Pearson depicted during a lengthy and rather awkward press conference on Monday at the King Power Stadium, half an hour in which he spoke a lot but said very little. There were no details about his conversations with Leicester\u2019s owners, no details about the assurances he received about his job, no details about the inexplicable decision to grab James McArthur by the throat while the midfielder lay on the ground. Instead there was plenty of straight-batting, a few tenuous jokes and the overall impression that it was business as usual, a mundane Monday as he prepared for the trip to Arsenal in the Premier League. However, Pearson was kidding no one. Leicester has been a club engulfed in farce since Saturday\u2019s 1-0 defeat to Crystal Palace, with a manager on the brink and a hierarchy unsure of the next move. There were four hours between reports of Pearson\u2019s sacking and a Leicester statement denying his departure on Sunday evening, a vacuum of silence from which no one has emerged smelling of roses. \u201cThe timescale was a lot different for me,\u201d said Pearson of an evening when indecision at Leicester was abounding. He insists that the club\u2019s owners have backed him in private, but it will be interesting to see whether their resolve is tested once more should City fall to a heavy defeat at the Emirates on Tuesday night. Leicester are bottom of the Premier League and, although the performances have perhaps not warranted their place at the foot of the table, time is ticking on a campaign that is threatening to end with an immediate relegation back to the Championship. Pearson seemed relatively calm but the signs indicate that he is feeling the pressure more than he is letting on. There was the ugly incident in November when he swore at a supporter who had been shouting abuse at him from the stands \u2013 resulting in a \u00a310,000 fine and touchline ban \u2013 and then the bizarre altercation with McArthur, a failed transfer target for Leicester, at the weekend. Perhaps even stranger than the incident itself was Pearson\u2019s assertion in post-match interviews that he could \u201clook after himself\u201d, following a remarkable flashpoint that saw the manager tangled up with a player who had inadvertently fallen into him. That was the one point which Pearson discussed bullishly here, lambasting the criticism he received on Saturday\u2019s Match of the Day from pundits Danny Murphy and Jermaine Jenas, and the presenter, Gary Lineker. Lineker described the whole incident as \u201ca bit strange\u201d, Jenas said \u201chis whole reaction shocked me a little bit\u201d, while Murphy added, \u201cif it was nothing come out and say it was nothing \u2013 maybe there\u2019s something underlying from the transfer that didn\u2019t happen\u201d. Pearson said: \u201cYou talk about these disciplinary things. Well, one was and one wasn\u2019t. Some people criticise me for not being animated enough, for sitting in stands and not showing any passion. I come down, get involved in a couple of situations and all of a sudden, it\u2019s a slightly different angle. I\u2019m a human being and I will make mistakes from time to time but what I will say is that any mistakes I make are very honest ones. \u201cIt was all very light-hearted. If you see a number of the pictures, there are smiles. These things happen. I have had both my knees replaced, you know. I did take quite a nasty tumble.\u201d For all the unsavoury business of the weekend, Pearson would not be drawn on how close he was to losing his job. He added: \u201cI\u2019m down here, sitting in front of you, talking about a situation over the weekend that has been generated by a speculative story. That\u2019s the nature of the beast. I want to talk about football but I fully understand that you are here to ask questions that are not necessarily what I want to talk about. \u201cI am today managing this football club as I have for at least three and a quarter years and I am looking to prepare my team the best way possible for a big game at Arsenal. And that, really, is all you\u2019re going to get from me today. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to shoulder the responsibility for my football team. I work for a football club that I\u2019ve worked for on two occasions, you think it\u2019s three but it\u2019s two. What goes on behind closed doors will stay there.\u201d And so Leicester go into Tuesday night\u2019s game against a side desperate to bounce back from a north London derby defeat. It is not the ideal preparation for an ominous challenge, to say the least, but Pearson admitted he was pleased to have a match to focus his attention on. For Leicester\u2019s owners, though, there are bigger issues. Opinions appear divided behind the scenes as the club attempts to pick itself up from a difficult and damaging few days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
