A statement issued by No 10 half an hour before the meeting ended described it as \"constructive and wide-ranging\". But before the summit two union leaders gave interviews making clear their distaste with the Labour leadership. Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB, said of the high command: \"Who do I wake up each morning excited by? Nobody.\" Unite's joint general secretary, Derek Simpson, said the prime minister had to abandon the New Labour platform, which he called \"suicide\", or \"stand aside\". He backed Ed Miliband as a someone he would pick \"in the future\". This displeasure is not expected to translate into another challenge to Brown, with one union source saying that the level of \"chatter\" in union circles about whether to get rid of him was \"low\". One of the Labour MPs behind the campaign to replace Brown a year ago also warned against a further putsch. Writing for the centre-left group Progress, George Howarth described the party leadership as \"yesterday's question\". He said: \"The moment when a leadership contest might have helped has passed. In any event, with a general election only a matter of months away, expecting a new leader to change the political weather would be a pretty tall order.\" Howarth led the move against Brown a year ago, but largely sat out the more serious challenge to the prime minister's position in June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
