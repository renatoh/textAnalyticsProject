Home-field advantage doesn\u2019t really apply to the Chargers, not when visiting fans routinely make the team feel like they\u2019re behind enemy lines in their own stadium. That was the case again on Sunday, when the Chargers hosted the Green Bay Packers. The predominant color in the stands was the green of the visitors, and the cheers rang out louder for Aaron Rodgers than Philip Rivers. The home team won, convincingly at that, but most people left the stadium disappointed. It has become one of the peculiar features of the NFL calendar since both the Chargers and Rams relocated to Los Angeles in 2017, marking a reunion between America\u2019s second-largest market and its most popular sporting league: more often than not, the teams\u2019 home games look and sound like home games for the opposition. Chargers players were showered with boos when they took the field against the visiting Philadelphia Eagles two years ago. The Rams got the same treatment last season at home against the Packers. Both Rivers, the Chargers quarterback, and Rams quarterback Jared Goff have regularly been forced to use a silent count to combat the noise generated by the away side\u2019s fans, typically an unnecessary measure to take for a team playing at home. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not ideal,\u201d Rivers said with a hint of resignation after the 2017 game against the Eagles. The home-field hostility hit a fresh apex for both teams on the same Sunday last month. That afternoon, the Rams were overwhelmed on the field and in the stands, which were blanketed by the red of the visiting San Francisco 49ers. \u201cThis turned into a home game pretty quickly,\u201d said San Francisco quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo after the game. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d It hasn\u2019t been quite as enjoyable for the ostensible home teams. A few hours later that day, the Chargers hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers, whose fans roared with approval when the stadium PA system blasted their team\u2019s adopted anthem, Renegade by Styx. It was supposed to be a gag; the song eventually transitioned to Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley, the punctuation to a long-running internet prank. But the joke didn\u2019t land, and Chargers players were miffed. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d Chargers running back Melvin Gordon said. \u201cThey started playing [the Steeelers\u2019] theme music. I don\u2019t know what we were doing \u2013 that little soundtrack, what they do on their home games. I don\u2019t know why we played that.\u201d Chargers offensive lineman Forrest Lamp was more blunt: \u201cWe\u2019re used to not having any fans here. It does suck, though, when they\u2019re playing their music in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re the ones at home. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s in charge of that, but they probably should be fired.\u201d The go-to line from Rams and Chargers brass is that it will take time to cultivate a true fan base in Los Angeles. Chargers owner Dean Spanos, who engineered the franchise\u2019s move from San Diego after voters there rejected his bid for public funding of a new stadium, told the New York Times earlier this year that it will \u201ctake maybe a generation\u201d for the team to find its footing in LA. On Tuesday this week, he was forced to deny rumors the team has discussed relocating to London. The two Los Angeles teams have varying histories in the city. The Chargers played their inaugural season there in 1960 before decamping for San Diego, where they remained for 56 years. The Rams have deeper roots in Los Angeles, playing in the area for 48 years beginning in 1946. But in 1995, the Rams moved to St Louis and the Raiders went up the coast to Oakland, leaving LA without an NFL franchise. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us some time to build the fan base back up again,\u201d said Ralph Valdez, the president and founder of the So Cal Rams Booster Club. \u201cThe Rams were gone for 21 years, and there were a lot of people who were left without a team to follow.\u201d Valdez started the group in 2004, when the Rams were just four years removed from winning a Super Bowl in St Louis, but he has been a fan since watching the team as a kid in the 1960s. \u201cOnce I saw the horns on the helmet, I was like, I\u2019m gonna follow them for the rest of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could be in Egypt. That\u2019s still going to be my team.\u201d Both LA teams are currently playing in temporary home stadiums \u2013 the Rams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the permanent home of the University of Southern California\u2019s football team; the Chargers at the 27,000-seat Dignity Health Sports Park, which serves as the home for the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer \u2013 before moving to the $5bn SoFi Stadium in the suburb of Inglewood next year. There is hope that the opening of the stadium, which will host the Super Bowl in 2022 and is expected to host the main opening ceremony for the 2028 Summer Olympics, will deepen the bond between the teams and the city. \u201cWhen we get to Inglewood, that\u2019s our home. That\u2019s the Rams\u2019 opportunity to start gathering new fans,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cWhen you have a home, you can build something.\u201d He added: \u201cIn 10 or 15 years, you\u2019re still going to have fans of other teams [in Los Angeles]. But their kids, their grandkids, I would expect them to be Rams fans.\u201d Perhaps. But to some outside observers, the recurring sight of away fans swarming Chargers and Rams home games has made the NFL\u2019s return to Los Angeles look frivolous. \u201cZero teams in Los Angeles \u2013 that wasn\u2019t enough. Two\u2019s clearly too many,\u201d said ESPN anchor Scott Van Pelt in a commentary that aired last month. \u201cThere are NFL fans in Los Angeles, plenty of them. Most of them just root for other teams. And they\u2019re going to have a fancy new place to see them play when they come to town.\u201d The Chargers and Rams are not only contending with lost time in their bid to attract fans. With the proliferation of apps like SeatGeek and StubHub, through which customers can easily buy and resell tickets, the away fan takeover has become ubiquitous \u2013 and not just in Los Angeles. Fans of the Minnesota Vikings flooded Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday for the team\u2019s away game against the Kansas City Chiefs, generating as much noise as the home supporters and performing their signature \u201cskol\u201d chant with impunity. New England Patriots fans turned out in droves for the team\u2019s road game last month against Washington; they did the same two weeks later when the Patriots played at the New York Jets. When iconic teams like the Patriots, Steelers, Packers or Dallas Cowboys come to town, whether in Los Angeles or elsewhere, the home fans are always at risk of being outnumbered. Resale ticket prices are an average of 53% higher than a typical game when the Packers are visiting, according to figures provided by SeatGeek. They are 55% higher for Cowboys road games. That can be enticing for a season-ticket holder, looking to resell a ticket. Johnny Abundez, a member of the Chargers fan group Bolt Pride who lives in the San Diego area, expected Packers fans to account for about 80% of attendees at Sunday\u2019s game, a projection that was easily corroborated both by those at the stadium and those watching on television. \u201cI know Chargers fans who sold cheap seats for $350 to that game,\u201d Abundez said. \u201cI\u2019m not one to judge. I know a lot of Chargers fans who like watching the game on TV.\u201d Abundez said that southern California, with its high concentration of transplants and warm climate, is particularly vulnerable to the away fan takeover. New York Yankees fans turned out en masse for the team\u2019s road trip against the Los Angeles Dodgers in August. And while the Los Angeles Clippers are NBA contenders now, the team\u2019s home games have long attracted throngs of visiting fans. It happened frequently to the Chargers in San Diego, too. \u201cSan Diego is a military community,\u201d Abundez said. \u201cAnd once it gets to this time of the year, you see snow and rain in the Midwest and on the East Coast, and we have beautiful weather out here.\u201d For Valdez, however, the secondary ticket market has been a source of frustration. His Rams group encourages members to sell to supporters of the home team. \u201cI don\u2019t understand people who call themselves Rams fans and who are selling their tickets to make a premium,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cWe tell them that if they\u2019re going to sell them, sell them to Rams fans.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
