A busy night of Champions League action was overshadowed by events at the Parc des Princes, where racist allegations led to Paris Saint-Germain and Istanbul Basaksehir players walking off the pitch. The game is set to continue from the 14th minute \u2013 when Tuesday\u2019s game was suspended after the the fourth official was accused of racism \u2013 on Wednesday, at 5.55pm (GMT), 6.55pm local time: Mbapp\u00e9 shows solidarity with Pierre Webo, the Basaksehir coach who was on the receiving end of alleged racist language: PSG v Basaksehir will continue on Wednesday, from the 14th minute onwards, Uefa confirm. \u201cUefa has \u2013 after discussion with both clubs \u2013 decided on an exceptional basis to have remaining minutes of match played tomorrow with a new team of match officials. Kick-off set at 18:55 (CET). A thorough investigation on the incident that took place will be opened immediately.\u201d In the Championship, players and staff from Millwall and Queens Park Rangers made a stand against racial discrimination: PSG v Istanbul Basaksehir will be replayed on Wednesday evening, at 6pm (GMT), 7pm local time, according to reports in France. Basaksehir players have left the stadium. The Turkish club tweeted: \u201cOur players has taken a decision NOT TO go back on the pitch after our assistant coach, Pierre Webo has been exposed to racist behaviour by the 4th Official. For the kind consideration. #NoToRacism.\u201d A much-changed Chelsea had to settle for a draw at Stamford Bridge. Match report by Jacob Steinberg: A simple message from the PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe: Manchester United crash out in Leipzig, despite rallying late on. Match report by David Hytner: A reminder that PSG v Istanbul Basaksehir was suspended following alleged racial abuse on 14 minutes at the Parc des Princes. The Turkish club were unhappy at the language used by the fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu, towards Pierre Webo, the assistant coach who was sent off. Both sets of players and staff left the pitch a few minutes later. Demba Ba vented his anger at the official. Ba could clearly be heard remonstrating with Coltescu. \u201cYou never say \u2018this white guy\u2019, you say: \u2018these guys,\u2019\u201d Ba said. \u201cSo, listen to me, why when you mention a black guy do you have to say \u2018this black guy?\u2019\u201d PSG players were ready to restart the match an hour ago but Basaksehir were unhappy that Coltescu would still play a part in the restarted game as the video assistant referee, swapping roles with the VAR, Marco Di Bello. There are reports that the Basaksehir players have changed out of their kits, a sign that the game will almost certainly not restart on Tuesday evening. Group E Chelsea 1-1 Krasnodar Rennes 1-3 Sevilla Group F Lazio 2-2 Club Brugge Zenit 1-2 Borussia Dortmund Group G Barcelona 0-3 Juventus Dynamo Kiev 1-0 Ferencvaros Group H Leipzig 3-2 Manchester United PSG v Istanbul Basaksehir suspended United crash out of the Champions League. Ronaldo scored twice to get one over on Messi, who endured a rather chastening evening at Camp Nou. Juve will progress from on top of Group G, with the La Liga side in second. \u201cIt never ends well for mega-stars at Bar\u00e7a (Stoichkov, Romario, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho, Neymar),\u201d emails Billy Graboso. \u201cThe club should\u2019ve let Messi go who is simply going through the motions this season.\u201d Full-time: Rennes 1-3 Sevilla! Full-time: Dynamo Kiev 1-0 Ferencvaros. The Ukraine side may have not made it through the last 16 of the Champions League, but they have qualified for the next best thing: the next round of the Europa League. Into stoppage-time in Leipzig ... 87 min: Three minutes to play in Leipzig and beyond. In Paris, it seems almost certain that we will not see any more football this evening. RMC, the French broadcaster, are reporting several Basaksehir players refused to restart tonight. Do not rule anything out ... Paul Pogba heads a corner downwards, it clips Harry Maguire and goes in via the Leipzig defender Konate! It might go down as an own goal. Regardless, are we about to witness another extraordinary United comeback? Meanwhile, Rennes pull a goal back against Sevilla. They trail 3-1. They can\u2019t, can they? 76 min: GOAL! Sevilla lead Rennes 3-0 in Spain! Pictures from the Parc des Princes show staff appearing to clear up some kit from behind the dugout. It does not look like we will have any football in Paris any time soon. 75 min: Leonardo Bonucci pokes in from close range after Ronaldo knocks down a corner ... but Juventus have a fourth goal ruled out at Camp Nou. It has just gone 10.30pm in Paris, where PSG\u2019s game against Istanbul Basaksehir has been suspended for almost an hour and a half. Surely that game is not going to restart, no matter Uefa\u2019s wishes. The noises are Basaksehir have no intention on restarting while the fourth official remains involved. \u201cOn Beinsport Turkey, the reporter in place said that Demba Ba doesn\u2019t want come back to game and sit on the bench,\u201d emails Alp Ulagay, a Turkish sports writer based in London. \u201cIt was said that some of the players are with him. The players are still in a meeting between themselves to decide on whether to continue to the game or not.\u201d From bad to worse. Surely that\u2019s it for United, who look resigned to the Europa League. Justin Kluivert reacts quickest in the box and Julian Nagelsmann cannot wipe the smile off his face. He dinks the ball in over De Gea. Maguire and Brandon Williams were static. 66 min: Krasnodar have just forced Kepa into a smart save down to his right. Chelsea have been fairly timid. Few players are staking their claim for a regular spot in Frank Lampard\u2019s starting lineup. Remember Chelsea made 10 changes. 65 min: Manchester United still trail RB Leipzig by two goals in Germany, while Chelsea are level-pegging with Krasnodar at Stamford Bridge. Elsewhere, QPR players celebrated taking the lead against Millwall by taking the knee. 61 min: Half-hour to play around the grounds. At Parc des Princes, there is still no sign of the game being restarted. \u201cWe\u2019re at a disturbing tipping-point, not a week goes by without an incident involving race,\u201d says the former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand. Here\u2019s more on events in Paris: 57 min: Chelsea are huffing and puffing. Elsewhere, the hold-up at the Parc des Princes seems to revolve around Istanbul Basaksehir being unhappy that the fourth official involved in that first-half incident, Sebastian Coltescu, could still play a part in the game, if restarted. They are adamant Coltescu should not be involved, even if he swaps places with Marco Di Bello, the video assistant referee. 55 min: GOAL! Dynamo Kiev lead Ferencvaros in Group G. A free-kick is head in by Popov. As it stands, that would be enough to send the Ukraine side into the Europa League. Uefa release a statement on PSG v Istanbul Basaksehir being suspended: \u201cFollowing an alleged incident involving the 4th official, the match was temporarily suspended. After consultation with both teams, it was agreed that the match would restart with a different 4th official. Uefa will thoroughly investigate the matter and further communication will be made in due course.\u201d He sends Ter Stegen the wrong way. Ronaldo 3-0 Messi. 50 min: The rest of the games are back under way. No changes at Stamford Bridge, but Donny van de Beek is on for Manchester United in Leipzig. Meanwhile, Juventus have a penalty at Camp Nou ... Ronaldo will take it! ... PSG\u2019s players are in the tunnel ready to go ... but there is no sign of the Istanbul Basaksehir players yet. \u201cAs far as we know Ba\u015fak\u015fehir would not to return to pitch unless the fourth official is immediately dismissed, as stated by a club official to Turkish public TV channel Trt Spor,\u201d emails Alp Ulagay, a Turkish sports writer based in London. If the fourth official remains involved, as reported, that might put pay to any restart. Things still remain unclear at the Parc des Princes. PSG v Istanbul Basaksehir is reportedly due to restart at 9pm (GMT), so in a few minutes, presumably without the fourth official involved in that first-half incident. The Istanbul assistant, Pierre Webo, was sent off before Ba confronted the official. Webo was shown a straight red card in the 16th minute before the players refused to continue the match amid allegations of racism by the fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu. Webo was sent off following a touchline row. The Turkish club appeared to be accusing the Romanian fourth official of using a racist term. Chelsea 1-1 Krasnodar Rennes 0-2 Sevilla Barcelona 0-2 Juventus Dynamo Kiev 0-0 Ferencvaros RB Leipzig 2-0 Manchester United PSG v Istanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir suspended following alleged racial abuse 44 min: Details on exactly what has happened at the Parc des Princes are unclear \u2013 but the commotion clearly centres on alleged racial abuse. We await confirmation of events which led the game to be suspended midway through the first half. 42 min: Demba Ba was livid with the Romanian fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu. In a clip of the moment the striker confronted Coltescu, Ba can be heard remonstrating. \u201cYou never say \u2018this white guy\u2019, you say: \u2018these guys,\u2019\u201d Ba says. \u201cSo, listen to me, why when you mention a black guy do you have to say \u2018this black guy?\u2019\u201d 37 min: Demba Ba was clearly incensed by something. There are images of the former Chelsea striker, a substitute in the game, railing at the Romanian fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu. Leonardo, the PSG sporting director, ended up on the pitch remonstrating with the officials. Both teams walked off the pitch in solidarity. 32 min: News of events in Paris is staggering, if reports are true that the reason both sets of players have headed for the dressing room is because of alleged racial abuse. There are reports such abuse was directed towards Demba Ba. Meanwhile Leipzig have had a third goal ruled out by the VAR. Manchester United breathe a sigh of relief. Play has been suspended at the Parc des Princes. There are reports of alleged racial abuse, from the fourth official towards the Istanbul Basaksehir assistant manager, Pierre Webo, and both sets of players have walked off the pitch. Hop, skip and jump, and it\u2019s in. 26 min: Chelsea have a penalty ... Abraham is upended in the box! It had been coming. The Russians pour down the left, the ball is worked in to Cabella inside the box and he proceeds to give Kepa, in goal for the night, the eyes and hammer a low shot into the corner. Chelsea trail. 20 min: Chelsea are not having too much fun at Stamford Bridge. Krasnodar are enjoying plenty of possession and are the ones asking questions. Lampard wants more. Juve double their advantage in style. Pjanic loses possession against his former club, Cuadrado crosses and Weston McKennie acrobatically thumps in on the volley. Cristiano Ronaldo strikes at Camp Nou for his 113th Champions League goal. Ronaldo rolls it down the middle of the goal after being fouled following neat buildup by Ramsey and Cuadrado. Oops ... 12 min: Krasnodar have a go at goal \u2013 but a volley sails well over Kepa\u2019s bar! 10 min: Chelsea are ticking along without too much fuss. They are yet to create a clear-cut chance. A reminder that Dortmund and Lazio progressed to the last 16 from Group F earlier. Jude Bellingham played 90 minutes in Turin. They fell behind to Sebastian Driussi\u2019s strike before goals by Lukasz Piszczek and Axel Witsel, via a Jadon Sancho assist, turned it around. Youssoufa Moukoko, at 16 years and 18 days, became the youngest player to feature in a Champions League match when he came on as a substitute. The last-16 draw takes place on Monday. The big question is: will Manchester United join them? 6 min: Billy Gilmour takes aim from 25 yards but it smacks Abraham en route. The rangy striker is all smiles. Chelsea have nothing to worry about tonight, after all. Elsewhere, Huddersfield lead Tony Pulis\u2019s Sheffield Wednesday 2-0. 4 min: Chelsea are playing some nice stuff early on, with Emerson\u2019s searching cross getting the fans going. It bounces in the box but Tammy Abraham cannot reach it. Lampard has made 10 changes but this team would worry most Premier League sides. Ah ... Championship: a couple of early goals at Vicarage Road, with Troy Deeney doubling Watford\u2019s advantage against Rotherham. They\u2019re two goals to the good. We\u2019re under way in Barcelona, Paris and beyond. Here we go, then! Chelsea\u2019s second string waltz on to the Stamford Bridge pitch before a crowd of 2,000 spectators ... Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has been talking that man Paul Pogba, whose agent Mino Raiola has opened his big mouth again this week. \u201cMy decision tonight is obviously tactical,\u201d he says, poker-faced. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing,\u201d he insists. \u201cWe made a team decision a bit before this game because we decided on Scott [McTominay] and Nemanja [Matic] in that midfield before West Ham.\u201d So close, but so far. Vanaken\u2019s equaliser is insufficient as goals by Ciro Immobile and Joaqu\u00edn Correa are ultimately enough to help the Italians progress. Axel Witsel\u2019s winner secures top spot in Group F. Meanwhile, Ed Aarons is at Millwall v Queens Park Rangers in the Champions League Championship, where the main pre-match takeaway is the welcome absence of booing: In injury time, 10-man Club Brugge have just smacked the crossbar. Had that gone in, they would\u2019ve snatched the second spot in Group F ... into the fifth minute of stoppage-time we go! Messi v Ronaldo at Camp Nou: any predictions? Group F latest: Borussia Dortmund are sitting pretty at the top with just a couple of minutes to play in Russia. They\u2019re 2-1 up at Zenit courtesy of an Axel Witsel strike. Meanwhile, despite playing with 10 men for 50 minutes, Hans Vanaken equalised for Club Brugge against Lazio in Turin. As it stands, Lazio would sneak through to the last 16 from second place. Stoppage time is fast approaching ... Chelsea v Krasnodar Chelsea: Kepa; Azpilicueta, R\u00fcdiger, Christensen, Emerson; Gilmour, Jorginho, Kovacic; Anjorin, Abraham, Havertz Subs: Caballero, Ziger, James, Tomori, Zouma, Alonso, Chilwell, Kant\u00e9, Mount, Pulisic, Werner, Giroud Krasnodar: Gorodov; Smolnikov, Martynovich, Kaio, Ram\u00edrez; Olsson, Vilhena, Wanderson, Claesson, Cabella; Berg Barcelona v Juventus Barcelona: Ter Stegen; Dest, Lenglet, Araujo, Jordi Alba; De Jong, Pjanic, Messi, Pedri; Griezmann Subs: Neto, I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a, Umtiti, Mingueza, Junior Firpo, Ale\u00f1\u00e1, Coutinho, Busquets, Riqui Puig, Matheus Fernandes, Konrad, Braithwaite Juventus: Buffon; Cuadrado, Danilo, Bonucci, De Ligt, Alex Sandro; Arthur, Mckennie, Ramsey; Morata, Ronaldo Subs: Pinsoglio, Szczesny, Dragusin, Frabotta, Rabiot, Portanova, Bentancur, Dybala, Chiesa, Bernardeschi, Da Graca, Kulusevski RB Leipzig v Manchester United RB Leipzig: Gulacsi; Mukiele, Konat\u00e9, Orban, Angelino; Sabitzer, Haidara, Kampl; Nkunku, Forsberg; Olmo Subs: Wosz, Poulsen, Tschauner, Adamas, Sorloth, Kluivert, Halstenberg, Martinez, Martel Man Utd: De Gea; Wan-Bissakae, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw; McTominay, Matic; Greenwood, Fernandes, Telles; Rashford Subs: Bailly, Tuanzebe, Pogba, Mata, Grant, Lingard, James, Fosu-Mensah, Ighalo, Williams, Henderson, Van de Beek On a make-or-break night for Manchester United, much hinges on how Paris Saint-Germain fare in Turkey. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side will reach the Champions League knockout stages if they return from RB Leipzig with a point, while PSG hope to seal a place in the last 16 without breaking sweat and will top Group H regardless of results elsewhere, providing they beat Istanbul Basaksehir. If United lose and PSG win, it is game over as far as the Champions League is concerned. If things do go pear-shaped, then United will face the rigamarole of Thursday-night fun in the Europa League. Meanwhile Chelsea, who have already secured top spot in Group E with a game to spare, will welcome Kepa Arrizabalaga back between the sticks against Krasnodar, who are guaranteed to advance to the Europa League. Elsewhere, Barcelona and Juventus do battle at Camp Nou having both already lit cigars and cruised into the knockout stages at the expense of Dynamo Kiev and Ferencvaros, who duel in Ukraine. Games in Group F, Club Brugge\u2019s visit to Lazio and Zenit v Dortmund, are already under way. If Brugge triumph in Turin, they will advance to the last 16.
