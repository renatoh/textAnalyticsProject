Now J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel is being dubbed \"the Che Guevara of finance\" and has a rapidly growing online fan base. Support sites opposing his incarceration and groups calling for Kerviel to be awarded the Nobel prize for economics have been springing up in cyberspace ever since the record loss-making rogue trader's name emerged on Thursday. US sites are already selling T-shirts for Le Rogue's most dedicated fans. Social-networking site Facebook, which removed Kerviel's page this weekend, has more than 20 groups dedicated to the man some are dubbing a modern-day Robin Hood. They include \"may J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel share\", \"a thousand and one questions sparked by the mysterious affair of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel\" and \"in support of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel returning to Facebook\". The Che Guevara group credits an \"amazing guy\" with the \"collapse\" of the whole system. More than 1,300 Facebook users have joined the \"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel should be awarded the Nobel prize in economics\" group, with the Prison Break mock-up below. Visitors can click through to a website selling tight-fitting tops bearing the caption \"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel's girlfriend\". The 31-year-old is celebrated on discussion walls as \"at last achieving a French world record in finance\" and as forcing the US Federal Reserve into last week's hefty rate cut. Some are even crediting the back office boy, whose move to a trading desk cost Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale billions, with averting a US recession. \"Merci, J\u00e9r\u00f4me,\" says economic analyst Ed Yardeni, former head economist of Deutsche Bank Securities. \"The recession is almost over, thanks to J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel and the panic reaction [of the Fed] ... I cannot remember any precedent for such strong support for the economy before the evidence of a recession became manifest,\" Yardeni told the Independent on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
