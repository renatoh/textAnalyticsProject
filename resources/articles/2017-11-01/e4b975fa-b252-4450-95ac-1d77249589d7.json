Pete Mailler, a 46-year-old cattle and grain producer from Boggabilla, has confirmed he will contest the New England byelection on 2 December, representing the micro-party he has established, CountryMinded. Mailler said he was running because it was important the voters in New England be given alternatives, and that the looming election was a genuine contest rather than a cakewalk for the National party. He said if he won, he would continue to support the Coalition government in Canberra, but he argued there was a \u201cunique opportunity to politically leverage the government\u2019s need for confidence and supply to maintain their hold on power\u201d. \u201cThe Coalition will be motivated to retain office for the maximum possible term,\u201d Mailler said. \u201cThey must deal with whoever holds the seat of New England on behalf of the electorate, unless that person is already a member of the Coalition.\u201d \u201cIn other words, Barnaby Joyce can\u2019t leverage the political power on offer to the electorate of New England, to get a better deal from this government from this election. \u201cThis election is a pivotal moment in the future of New England and for rural and regional Australia generally. \u201cThis election is an opportunity to show that the New England electorate can\u2019t be taken for granted by any political party and is an opportunity to secure better political outcomes for our rural and regional communities.\u201d Mailler said he understood that voters in New England had some sympathy for Joyce given his disqualification by the high court, but people should think about their capacity \u201cto influence politics positively for their electorate and the nation because this election affects the Coalition\u2019s one-seat majority\u201d. Nominations for the byelection close on Thursday. As well as Mailler, Joyce will face off against Labor\u2019s David Ewings, from Scone in the southern part of the electorate, and the Armidale-based independent Rob Taber, who has run at the past two elections. Taber, a local businessman, has told Guardian Australia he would not enter any minority government agreement with the Coalition, but deal with things issue by issue. \u201cI would not support either side. I would be right down the middle,\u201d Taber said last week. \u201cThey might come to me and say it all hinges on you, you\u2019ve got the balance of power, and my feel on that is they will come to me, and I will say it\u2019s not my problem. \u201cWhy are you going to make it my problem? You go away and sort it out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
