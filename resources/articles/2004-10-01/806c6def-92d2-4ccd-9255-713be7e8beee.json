With David Blunkett, the home secretary, this week due to issue his first annual report on the progress of the anti-social behaviour order (Asbo) strategy, his cabinet colleague, Lord Falconer, flagged up procedural reforms that ministers hope will encourage people to speak out against menacing neighbours. Mr Blunkett will give an audit of the number of Asbos taken out by councils and announce that 50 more areas will be given assistance in how to handle the new process. The controversial dispersal orders - telling local gangs to move on - have been used 400 times, he revealed last week. By focusing on the message that law-abiding citizens who take a stand will get the support they need, Lord Falconer claimed he will be \"rebalancing\" the justice system in favour of victims of crime and away from its perpetrators. Last night the announcement of the constitutional affairs secretary met with scepticism from the law-and-order lobby and concern from Liberty, the civil rights campaign, that the move is merely \"election window dressing\" which might undermine defendants' rights. Though crime is falling in most categories, ministers are aware that it is an important election issue for many Labour voters whose lives are made miserable by vandalism and other anti-social conduct. Before he unveils the Asbo record on Thursday, the home secretary must tackle another voter-sensitive issue: today's EU decision with 24 fellow-home affairs ministers to confirm majority voting procedures on asylum and immigration - except where Britain exercises its right to \"opt-in\" to new procedures only when it wants to do so. Mr Blunkett faces a fresh barrage of rightwing tabloid hostility to today's \"surrender of national sovereignty\" (the deal was actually agreed at the Amsterdam summit in 1997) and yesterday moved to cover his back. He let it be known that he had just rung his Dutch counterpart, in the chair at today's session, to stress that he will not accept a common asylum system or anything else that weakens the UK's control of its own borders. \"He said these things should not be on the table,\" a spokesman said. On the domestic front, Lord Falconer's changes to Asbo procedures include screening to hide witnesses from the defendant, the provision of separate facilities while waiting to testify in court, as well as the option of evidence by live link or in private and video-recorded testimony. There will also be a three-fold increase in the number of fast-track criminal courts in England and Wales - from 12 to 40 by early November. Full-time magistrates and prosecutors are put in place to deliver effective remedies quickly. David Davis, the shadow home secretary, was quick to criticise the proposal as a belated admission of neglect. \"While it is acceptable to enable witnesses to give evidence by video link, letting them give evidence from behind screens could be the start of a slippery slope. We also need to be told how the government intends to pay for all these extra courts, and whether other cases will have to be pushed aside,\" he said. \u00b7 The Association of Chief Police Officers yesterday signalled disappointment with 24-hour drinking which the new Licensing Act will permit. It comes at a time when violent crime, mostly drink-fuelled weekend violence, rose 11% last spring compared with the same period in 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
