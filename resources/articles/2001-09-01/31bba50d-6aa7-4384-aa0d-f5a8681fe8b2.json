Rangers now seem certain to pull out - or be expelled - from the tournament by Uefa, with chairman David Murray reiterating that he would not send a team to Dagestan because of safety fears. The club has longer to press its case after the postponement of today's ties, but seems unlikely to change its policy. \"The club is taking further advice on this matter and considering the detailed implications,\" Murray said. Rangers had launched the appeal for a neutral venue, initially to Uefa, after advice from the Foreign Office that they should not travel to the troubled state. It was Uefa's insistence that Rangers completed the first-round first-leg tie that triggered the club's appeal to CAS. Rangers have been unhappy about playing the tie since the draw two weeks ago, and a car bomb explosion in Makhachkala on Sunday - injuring two people - increased the club's worries, despite the country's Interior Ministry promising safe passage. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
