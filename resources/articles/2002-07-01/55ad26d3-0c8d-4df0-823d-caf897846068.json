Four years ago the Brazilian footballer was in despair, a 21-year-old facing humiliation as crushing as it was mysterious. Yesterday his two goals in Yokohama's International Stadium gave Brazil their fifth title, bringing an extraordinary tournament to a deliriously romantic conclusion and drawing forth tears of a very different kind. His mysterious illness on the day of the final in Paris in 1998 spread dismay through his team, giving France a relatively easy ride to the championship. Yesterday Germany were the victims as he took his revenge on fate and then dedicated the 2-0 victory to God, his family and his physiotherapist. By scoring after 67 and 79 minutes, he left his opponents without a hope of recovery. The many yellow-shirted Brazilian supporters in the crowd of 69,029 exploded with a euphoria that would almost certainly have registered in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Brazil is football's spiritual home, and Ronaldo's renaissance is now one of the game's greatest stories. Since leaving the Stade de France he has spent more time with doctors than with coaches. Yesterday Gerard Saillaint, the surgeon who operated twice on his right knee, was his guest at the match. So the 2002 World Cup finally did something predictable. Yet when the tournament began, less than a month ago, both the eventual finalists were rank outsiders. Despite winning the championship seven times between them, neither had shown any sort of form during the qualification rounds and both lost key players in the weeks leading up to the tournament. In the end, perhaps these setbacks enabled them to make progress free from the usual pressures. They were also able to profit from the phenomenon that got the tournament off to such a striking start, the unexpected early departure of Argentina, Italy and France. The 17th World Cup was the first to be held in Asia, and the first to be co-hosted. It was, indeed, a cup of two halves. Whereas the South Koreans supported their own remarkable team with a visceral passion that evoked football's oldest traditions, the Japanese responded to the arrival of Brazil and England with the kind of innocent and slightly synthetic enthusiasm that they might once have reserved for the simultaneous arrival of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The 64 matches have been watched by a total of 2.7 million people, an average of just over 42,000 a game. The rows of empty seats at many of the matches were the result of administrative errors all round, the responsibility of the governing body in Switzerland and the ticket distributors in Britain as well as the local organisers. Sharing a tournament between two countries inevitably reduces the event's cultural identity, an intangible quality that grows more precious in the memory. But Fifa's blazered functionaries are already talking about the possibility of holding the 2010 tournament in two African countries. Fears that the presence of the English and German teams would lead to the opening of new markets for hooli ganism in the far east were not realised. For the England party and those who followed them around Japan, it was difficult to comprehend the impact of the tournament on the home front. All those giant screens in public places and the time off school and work looked less like a rediscovery of the value of nationhood than the opening of a new ride in a theme park. Some of the old rides still remain to be demolished, of course, and with Wembley in mind it was humbling to enter the stadiums in Seogwipo, Kobe, Shizuoka, Niigata and elsewhere, apparently erected without restraint or distress. What happens now to these theatres of sport? In Japan, particularly, there is a feeling that they were built less out of need than as another outlet for the aggressively proactive concrete industry. In both host countries, for all their relative success in this tournament, it is by no means guaranteed that the domestic football programme will suddenly leap to the top of the sporting agenda, justifying the permanent existence of these facilities. Tae kwon do in Korea and baseball in Japan will remain the principal text of taxi drivers' conversations. But for a month, while all South Korea lined up behind the Fighting Reds and much of Japan divided itself between Beckham and Ronaldo, this really was the only game in town."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
