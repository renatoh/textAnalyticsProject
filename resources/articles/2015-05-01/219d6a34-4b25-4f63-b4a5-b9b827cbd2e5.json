Jack Sen, who was to stand for the party in West Lancashire, said that minorities in South Africa were being ethnically cleansed. And he laid the blame for a \u201cgenocide\u201d in western Europe at the door of the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, and other prominent Jewish figures across the world. He also included Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry, who is not Jewish. Sen made the comments in an interview with the far-right South African website the European Knights Project (EKP) published on 12 April. He said on Friday that he stood by them. Separately, antisemitic comments about Labour\u2019s candidate for Liverpool Wavertree, Luciana Berger, were posted on his Twitter account on Thursday. Echoing language often used by antisemitic groups, Sen linked Miliband to a \u201cshadowy elite bent on [the west\u2019s] destruction\u201d and said that his father, Ralph Miliband, who arrived in the UK after fleeing Nazi persecution of Jews, \u201cdid his utmost to destroy his host nation\u201d. The comments on Twitter accused Berger of having \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d \u2013 a common antisemitic slur meant to suggest that Jews are loyal to Israel, rather than to the country in which they live. Berger said that those comments were clearly antisemitic. She said: \u201cRemarks like these have no place in our politics. I am glad that Ukip has taken action.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian on Friday, Sen said that they had been tweeted by a party activist, not by him. But he failed to provide any further details. Referring to his EKP interview, Sen said that he was neither aware that the people he had attacked were Jewish, nor that his comments about them echoed well-known antisemitic jibes. The apparent implication that there was a group of Jewish people across the world that was culpable was accidental, he said. He said the link he was trying to draw between the people he mentioned was not their Judaism, but what he saw as their shared political views. In the EKP interview, Sen said: \u201cThe minority South African, and Afrikaner in particular, is an endangered species in my estimation. It is being systemically hunted into extinction by a people we were told wanted to live in democratic harmony back in 1994. \u201cRemember the rainbow nation propaganda campaign? Hard to reach that lofty ideal when people are being gunned down for sport from Joburg to Capetown. It\u2019s still hunting season from what I can see.\u201d He also said that there was a \u201ccommon thread\u201d that bound two prominent Jewish figures in South Africa and Miliband. \u201cYour audience will have to decide what that is,\u201d he told the website. A series of tweets were directed at Berger from his account. One read: \u201cIf you had it your way you\u2019d send the \u00a3 to Poland/Israel.\u201d Berger was accused of having \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d and one of the tweets read: \u201cBritain\u2019s youngest Jewish MP, Luciana Berger, is facing criticism over her record of \u2026 loyalties\u201d. The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, apologised for the comments attributed to Sen and those posted on his Twitter account. He told ITV News: \u201cWe\u2019ve got over 5,000 people standing for us at this election, and less than a handful have caused us a problem. \u201cUkip is a non-sectarian, non-racist party and we\u2019ve actually got a remarkable number of people standing for us from every single walk of life, from every religion and every ethnic group in this country.\u201d In a statement, the party said: \u201cJack Sen, a Ukip candidate, has expressed views that in no way reflect the views of the party and any other of our hard-working dedicated candidates. \u201cIn the light of these and other comments, Mr Sen has been suspended from Ukip with immediate effect.\u201d A party source indicated that he would have two weeks to appeal against the suspension and would be expelled from the party either at that point or if his appeal failed. Sen said he felt he had been let down by the party, which he said had offered him no support over these allegations, nor over earlier claims that he had received death threats. He told the Guardian that he had found out about his suspension from the media and that no one from Ukip had called him. The news of his suspension comes after Janice Atkinson, one of the leading figures in the party and a parliamentary candidate, was expelled from Ukip over fake expenses claims."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
