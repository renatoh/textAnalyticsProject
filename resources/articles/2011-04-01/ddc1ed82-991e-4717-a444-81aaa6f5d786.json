Suppose that you as South at love all pick up the following impressive collection, playing moreover for hard cash rather than master points: \u2660AQ \u2665AKQJ8643 \u2666AK \u26634 You open the bidding with two clubs, partner produces a negative reply of two diamonds, and right-hand opponent makes life awkward by jumping to five diamonds. What call do you make? The safe and sound approach is to bid five hearts, but I wouldn't call anyone deluded who bid six hearts instead. West leads a trump, and it occurs to you when you see the dummy that East must be a pretty desperate sort. \u266010754 \u266592 \u2666Q83 \u2663KQ75 You try dummy's low heart but East plays the five rather than the hoped-for 10 \u2013 the nine of hearts will not be a late entry to the table. When you draw a second round of trumps, it is West who produces the 10. How will you continue? There are two possible lines of play. You can cash the ace and king of diamonds, then exit with a club. If West has the ace, your problems are over \u2013 after playing it, he will have to lead a black card (since he has of course no diamonds), and that will take care of your losing spade. If East has the ace and returns a spade after winning the first club, you will have to finesse, and if West has the king your hopes are over. Alternatively, and far more subtly, you can play East for a singleton spade and the ace of clubs. If he has that, you must cash the top diamonds and the ace of spades before playing a club \u2013 East, with nothing but minor-suit cards left, will have to provide you with access to the two winners in the dummy. Anyone can make a slam by taking a finesse or two, but if the second of these lines happens to be the only way to succeed, you can dine out on it for months. Doubtless with this in mind, South embarked on the more sophisticated line, and West cashed the ace of clubs and the king of spades for one down. \"You idiot\", said North. \"Why did West lead a trump? Obviously he didn't have any diamonds, and if he'd had nothing but low cards in one of the black suits, he'd have led that suit to try to put East in for a diamond ruff.\" South bowed his head, and North relented somewhat. \"It's all right\", he said. \"But next time, save grandeur for grand slams.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
