He was arrested, and the policeman wrote in his report that he had a gun on him at the time of the purchase. Guns were later found at his home. That meant, because of mandatory minimum sentencing regarding a drug charge involving a firearm, Angelos was sentenced to 55 years in prison, a sentence that even the judge handing it down decried as \u201cunjust, cruel, even irrational\u201d. His long-term incarceration will cost the state an estimated $1.5m. Since then, Angelos has become the poster child for a growing campaign from both the left and the right wings of politics, the essential message of which is this: there is something deeply, deeply wrong with the US justice system. On Thursday morning, a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a bill that would make sweeping changes to criminal justice in the US, including a long-awaited scaling-back of the kind of mandatory minimum sentences that forced the judge\u2019s hands in Angelos\u2019 case. Mandatory minimum sentencing was greatly expanded following the drug scares of the 1980s. Politicians, all seeking to look toughest on drug crime, passed the draconian 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, in which Congress introduced a variety of mandatory sentences for drugs. Mandatory minimums were subsequently vastly expanded in Bill Clinton\u2019s 1994 omnibus crime bill. Introducing the bill at the Capitol on Thursday, Utah senator Mike Lee talked at length about Angelos. \u201cWeldon Angelos was a young man \u2026 He made some mistakes,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe judge \u2026 saw that this was manifestly unjust sentence \u2013 he didn\u2019t deserve to be in prison till he was 80. However, the judge pointed out his hands were tied. It\u2019s one of the reasons when I got here, I decided [sentencing reform] was something I wanted to work on.\u201d If passed into law, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act will reduce the mandatory life without parole sentence for a third drug or violent offence and the mandatory minimums on drug possession charges involving a firearm. Crucially for people like Angelos, many of the provisions in the bill would take effect retroactively. Molly Gill, the government affairs counsel for the lobby group Families against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM), told the Guardian that while the group was supporting the bill, \u201cit doesn\u2019t go as far as we would like \u2013 which is a full repeal of mandatory minimums\u201d. But she said that under the bill, Angelos \u2013 and the 140-odd others who fall foul of the law each year \u2013 would receive a sentence of around 15 years, not 55. Notably, the bill would also expand the \u201csafety valve\u201d exception, which allows non-violent drug offenders with non-serious criminal histories to escape mandatory minimums. It would also allow some prisoners to earn time credits on their sentence to complete rehabilitation programmes. Republican senator Chuck Grassley called it \u201ca landmark piece of legislation\u201d, and praised its bipartisan nature. \u201cThis is a bill we can be proud of,\u201d he said. \u201cToday is one of the finer days in Congress, especially when you compare with what\u2019s happening along the way [in the House of Representatives],\u201d said Democratic senator Chuck Schumer, who also spoke at the announcement, referring in general to congressional dysfunction. The bill may reduce mandatory minimums on drug crimes, but it also creates new ones: a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years for interstate domestic violence resulting in a death, and a new mandatory minimum of five years for providing weapons for terrorists. Many, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), have pointed out that this means the bill is not entirely positive from their point of view. \u201cThe bill offers many promising reforms that will reduce mass incarceration and its devastating effects on our country: changing sentences retroactively for drug offenses, increasing support for anti-recidivism programs, limiting the use of solitary confinement for young people, providing for the compassionate release of elderly prisoners,\u201d said Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU. But he added: \u201cWe have deep concerns about other aspects, especially the expansion of some mandatory minimum sentences. We believe that punishments must fit the crime and that a cookie-cutter approach too often gets in the way of justice.\u201d Gill, too, was wary of the new mandatory minimums added in the bill. \u201cWe hope they\u2019re removed from the bill before it passes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think they\u2019re unnecessary. These are serious crimes, and people are going to get serious punishments without mandatory minimums. We think there\u2019s no evidence that mandatory minimums deter crimes.\u201d Despite the new minimums, Holly Harris, the executive director of US Justice Action Network, a bipartisan advocacy organisation that works for criminal justice reform, was positive about the bill. \u201cLook, every piece of legislation in Congress is a compromise bill,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI think we won more than we lost here, and if it\u2019s what it took to get the deal done, we\u2019ve won so much more than we\u2019ve lost.\u201d The bill was introduced by Grassley, the chair of the senate judiciary committee, and Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat. Durbin, who worked closely with Republican Mike Lee on parts of the bill, thanked Lee, describing the two of them as a \u201cpolitical odd couple\u201d. \u201cThe question will be asked: can you get this through the Senate?\u201d Durbin said, but pointed to the bipartisan nature of the bill as a good sign that it could. \u201cThe next question is, what will happen in the House,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWho knows?\u201d Schumer cut in. A Senate aide who worked on the bill told the Guardian that Angelos case was reflective of the root of the bill \u2013 something that lawmakers on both the right and left of the political spectrum could agree was deeply wrong. \u201cI think there was common ground on those most severe, enhanced mandatory minimums,\u201d he said. \u201cThat Weldon Angelos case that Senator Lee mentioned, with [its] really severe enhanced mandatory minimums for gun crimes \u2013 that\u2019s kind of where we started.\u201d After the announcement, leading Democratic senator Patrick Leahy told the Guardian how the bill does in the House depends on how well the bill does in the Senate. \u201cIf you get a good groundswell here, there are a lot of people sympathetic to our coalition here that would support [the bill] in the House,\u201d he said. But he pointed to the upcoming change in House leadership as a point of uncertainty. Schumer echoed Leahy\u2019s concerns, but told the Guardian \u201csome of the people on the hard right\u201d support the bill, which differentiates it from other bipartisan efforts. Julie Stewart, president of FAMM, praised the measure in a statement on Thursday morning, calling it \u201cthe most significant sentencing reform legislation in a generation\u201d. She said, however, that it was \u201cone of the more historic pieces of legislation we\u2019ve seen in a long time. It would address some of the worst-case scenarios that often cross our desks here, in terms of people getting life without parole for drug offences.\u201d Momentum has been steadily building for reform in the area of criminal justice, but the Senate announcement represents a high-watermark of bipartisan support. In June, representatives Jim Sensenbrenner and Bobby Scott introduced the Safe, Accountable, Fair and Effective Justice Act, which goes even further than the Senate reforms proposed on Thursday, and the two leading members of the House judiciary committee are reportedly working on their own legislation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
