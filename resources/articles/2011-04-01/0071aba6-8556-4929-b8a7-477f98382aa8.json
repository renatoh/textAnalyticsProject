The 25-year-old Northern Ireland No1 is receiving counselling for depression and looked a shadow of his usual self for most of the match. Without doing anything special Stevens led 9-6 but it is not in Allen to stop trying and out of the blue he made a break of 103. In a tight finish to the next frame Stevens missed a cut pink for the match and Allen potted a long pink plus the black to close to 8-9. Stevens was by now feeling extreme pressure. A loser of two finals here and three semis, all of them close, he also lost a 2008 quarter-final to Shaun Murphy from five up with six to play. When Allen left the last red over a pocket , the Welshman had a prime chance to win 10-8 but quickly lost position and was caught at 9-9. Two dreadful blunders from Stevens starkly showed the extent of his disarray as Allen authoritatively took the decider and embraced his four-year-old daughter Lauren, who was a front-row spectator alongside her mother, Reanne Evans, the women's world champion. John Higgins, who began his challenge for a fourth world title by making three centuries, 132, 101 and 131, in taking a 6-3 overnight lead over Stephen Lee, arrived here at the peak of his powers. Since his return from suspension on 1 November Higgins has won five tournaments: a minor one in Hamm, Germany, his third UK Championship, the Welsh Open, a high-quality Chinese invitation event, the Hainan Classic, and last week the revived Scottish Championship.He quickly regained top form and top place in the world rankings. Graeme Dott progressed to the last 16 with a 10-7 win over Mark King after his 7-3 lead had been reduced to 7-6. \"I think John [Higgins] is the favourite,\" Dott said. \"Ronnie [O'Sullivan] would be a threat even if he played left-handed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
