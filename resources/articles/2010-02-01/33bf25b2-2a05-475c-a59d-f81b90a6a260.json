It was his long-range drive after 43 seconds of the 1997 FA Cup final that set Chelsea on their way to a 2-0 victory over Middlesbrough, a goal that was, until being bettered by Louis Saha last year, the fastest in FA Cup final history. Here his players were on the receiving end of a strike that was much less ferocious yet equally remarkable as Reading and Albion drew this frenetic fifth-round tie. Nine seconds was all it took for the home side to seize the lead. Albion had kicked off and the ball was fed swiftly to right-back Gianni Zuiverloon, but the Dutchman dallied, allowing Jimmy K\u00e9b\u00e9 to pilfer possession and then guide a low shot under the goalkeeper. \"That was part of the game plan, to concede an early goal,\" Di Matteo joked, his mood tempered by Albion's double comeback including a late strike from Joe Mattock that has forced a replay. The visitors were uncharacteristically servile in the first half as Reading's brutish approach earned them a greater share of the ball. Brian McDermott's team could have been 2-0 ahead within 10 minutes, but K\u00e9b\u00e9 buried his far-post header into the side netting from an acute angle. Albion equalised against the run of play when Robert Koren, a last-minute inclusion in the team after Andwele Slory's withdrawal due to an Achilles injury, tapped in at the far post from Chris Brunt's teasing cross. Reading's second half began almost as badly as Albion's first. Shane Long received a straight red card three minutes after the re-start for leaping into a challenge with Abdoulaye M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9. However, Youssouf Mulumbu wasted Albion's numerical advantage by earning himself a second yellow card when he tugged back Brynjar Gunnarsson. Chances were spurned as both sides sought the winner. Simon Church eventually re-established Reading's lead when he collected a delightful, weighted through ball and hit the target at the second time of asking. But Reading's hopes of a first appearance in the quarter-finals since 1927 were crushed, for the time being at least, when Mattock drove in the second late equaliser. McDermott, refused to bemoan the result. \"It was a dream start for us and I thought we'd won it, I thought we'd weathered the comeback,\" he said. \"We tried to keep the momentum going after the sending offs and we came very close. It's just a shame they scored with three minutes to go.\" Reading had won their previous three matches going into this tie, giving themselves a lifeline in the Championship's relegation scrap and conviction that they could overturn Di Matteo's league leaders. \"Since I've been here we've matched every team we've played against and, apart from the 4-1 defeat against Plymouth, we've done ourselves justice,\" McDermott said. \"My only nightmare is if we don't perform. But we've done that today, so I'm proud.\" THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Ian Maynard, Observer reader I didn't get too carried away when Jimmy Kebe scored in the opening seconds, because I feared we might have stirred up a hornets' nest. I thought Kebe was going to cross the ball but he shot instead and it was happy days for us. West Brom are a tough team who like to play passing football and it was always going to be hard. After Simon Church got our second I was hoping we could hang on for the victory, but it was not to be. The full-back Andy Griffin was our best player.

Graham Dorrans bossed the midfield and Roman Bednar led the line superbly. Youssouf Mulumbu didn't do us any favours by getting a second yellow for an unnecessary shirt pull. It was 11 v 10 in our favour at that point. It was pleasing that Joe Mattock got the late equaliser. We signed him for \u00a31.9m from Leicester in the summer and he's struggled. That first goal will help his confidence.
