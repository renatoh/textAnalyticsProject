You can hardly make a plausible story from them, yet they add up to one of the great modern myths. A single image says it all. Place the ape on a skyscraper, with the woman clasped in his fist, and send in planes to shoot him down. King Kong connects our origins in the swamp with our ambition to reconquer heaven by building towers of Babel; it is about atavism and aspiration, and, when the monster starts to fancy his screaming female captive, it forces us to rethink the divisions we have made between animal, man and god. Like all myths, the story of Kong must be retold, since its meaning is always changing. In 1933, the first film sold itself as a surreal nightmare, crudely exploiting popular terrors. Remade by John Guillermin in 1976, King Kong acquired a conscience and an ironic self-consciousness; this version of the fable was meant to provoke guilt and compassion, not simply to horrify us. Now Peter Jackson has spent $207 million on an interpretation that is, as one of its stars, Jack Black, enigmatically promises, 'so rad'. Jackson's monsters are digital, as is his reconjured replica of Manhattan during the Depression. But the FX dramatise a dilemma. In the poster, Kong clasps the spire of the Empire State Building and stares at the woman in his other hand, while she coolly, gravely stares back at him. He does not roar and Naomi Watts, cast as his squeeze, does not scream. Instead, they are considering their relationship, as zoological kin and, perhaps, as lovers. Jackson has treated the original film with solemn respect, which is why, unlike Guillermin, he does not update the story. He views King Kong, like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, as a saga about our early history, an epic of evolution. Merian C Cooper and Ernest B Schoedsack, who produced the 1933 film, would have been surprised by this reverence. They threw their King Kong together with an unthinking haste that accounts for its zany illogic. Schoedsack had visited the Galapagos Islands, whose regressive species first made Darwin think about the long process of mutation and adaptation that turned monkeys into men. He and Cooper first planned a film with the Darwinian title of Creation, set in a lost world stocked with a brontosaurus, a triceraptos and a pterodactyl. When that project was cancelled, the pre-fabricated ogres, all of them miniatures, jerked into a semblance of life by freeze-frame animation, were lined up to challenge Kong in a series of gruesome prizefights. The ape's blonde bride, played by Fay Wray, was a titillating addition; writhing and screeching, she catered to popular prejudices about miscegenation. In the novelisation of the screenplay by Delos W Lovelace, Kong's paw picks off her flimsy garments and she shudders as she begs her stalwart human rescuer not to let the filthy beast touch her again. The Empire State Building was new in 1933 and, like all early skyscrapers, it served as a ladder up which man clambered into heaven; the spire commandeered by Kong was designed as a mooring post for Zeppelins. To place the ape on this proud summit confounded such progress and declared that we are still embedded in the swamp. Kong's other rampages in Manhattan were jokily improvised. Why does he make a detour to tear down the elevated railway on Third Avenue? Because Cooper had once lived beside the tracks and still resented the way the clatter of the trains kept him awake. Kong's creators gave themselves the pleasure of destroying him; it is Cooper and Schoedsack who play the pilots of the plane that shoots him down. By the time of Guillermin's remake, the barbarous fable had to be rethought. In 1933, no one questions the motives of the showman Denham, who captures Kong, stupefies him with gas and exhibits him in chains as a circus freak. In 1976, this buccaneering entrepreneur could only be a villain; he is now not a movie-maker, like the Denham of the original film, but a cynical prospector for oil, whose business is the ravaging of nature; he imprisons Kong in the empty hull of a tanker meant to contain the fossil fuels he digs for. Driscoll, the ship's captain, who, in 1933, was content to flex his muscles and perform feats of derring-do to save the heroine, underwent a corresponding change of heart. Played by Jeff Bridges, he is a Princeton geologist whose Aquarian mane of hair voices for his liberal views. He possesses, as Bridges said at the time, 'a personal moral code', like a crusading knight; he ends by viewing Kong as 'a Christ-like symbol of the pure, moral being done in by greedy, unprincipled men'. That is quite a turnabout: the heights of Manhattan are Kong's Golgotha and instead of bellowing in fury, he grimaces in martyred sorrow. The beast's lust for beauty proved tricky in 1976. Black men in the American south were no longer being lynched for molesting white women; why shouldn't the heroine enjoy a liaison with a gorilla? Producer Dino de Laurentiis hoped to make defensive fun of the relationship. He wanted to cast Cher or Barbra Streisand, who could be relied on to mock Kong's inept wooing rather than abjectly yelling for help. The role finally went to Jessica Lange, who is sexually knowing, even flirtatious, although she did cut a line of dialogue which, during her bridal night in the jungle, expressed anxiety about the genital proportions of her swarthy partner. When Kong in 1933 peeps through a bedroom window and disturbs a woman's dreams, he defines himself as an erotic incubus, at once alarming and alluring. The character played by Lange is no stranger to pornographic fantasy. She is taken aboard the tanker after the yacht in which she was travelling with her sleazy protector blows up; at the time of the explosion, they were watching Deep Throat By 1976, the Empire State Building had lost its hubristic swagger; Kong ascended the World Trade Centre instead. His conquest of this new pinnacle caused problems, reminding the city of its physical and psychological frailty. The Port Authority worried that the mob assembled to cluster around the body of the fallen Kong, combined with the tonnage of production equipment, would cause the plaza to collapse. The police were unsure whether they could control the 30,000 obstreperous, unpaid extras. Bruce Bahrenburg's comment, in his book about the filming, has a premonitory ring to it: 'The crowd could suddenly become an instrument of terror.' Nevertheless, Kong now looks more like a defender than an aggressor. In the poster for Guillermin's film, he plants a foot on each of the Twin Towers and swats the planes that target him. Since 9/11, the image has lost its menace and become comforting: a cuddly but indomitable guardian bestrides the citadel and fends off the jets before they can slam into it and set it alight. No wonder New Yorkers have such an abiding fondness for Kong. He advertises the lottery, as if he, too, were a case history of the triumphantly gratified American dream; he could probably get himself elected mayor. That may well yet happen because, as befits a mythic hero, he is immortal. Merian Cooper wanted to transplant him to outer space, settling him on an asteroid where Denham would be reunited with him during a quest for the river of youth. The ape reproduced himself in an early sequel, Son of Kong; Guillermin also revived him in 1986 in King Kong Lives, which explains that the fall from the top of the World Trade Centre merely concussed him and left him comatose, in need of a heart transplant. The operation is carried out using blood from a giant female ape tracked down in the rain forest. Thanks to her, the revitalised Kong regains his virility, though this time he couples with a member of his own species. Kong has flourished off-screen, too. In 1983, he celebrated his 50th anniversary by returning to the Empire State Building. An inflatable ape of black nylon made the climb, bumpily hauled up by rigging; the promoter of the stunt likened the feat to raising the Titanic. Unfortunately, the cables stuck, the nylon snagged and Kong deflated in midair. That mishap was less embarrassing than the premature ejaculation of the hydraulic Kong used by Guillermin. As he held Jessica Lange aloft, someone noticed that a rivulet of brake fluid, meant to control his gears, was trickling down his hairy leg. 'Oh my God,' cried a technician, 'he's leaking!' 'Nah,' snarled a colleague, 'he just got excited seeing the girl!' Accidents like these have humanised Kong, as his infatuation for the squirming blonde was meant to do. He is, after all, not a monster or a 'beast-god', as Edgar Wallace called him, but a toy, a playmate. Hence Peter Jackson's insistence on impartiality when helping to design the video game that will be one of the new film's spin-offs. Jackson wants game players to alternate between the roles of hunter and hunted, to feel themselves inside Kong's hirsute skin, while also adopting the perspective of Driscoll (played in the film by Adrien Brody, and reconceived as a script-writer with a fraught sense of social responsibility). Naomi Watts has recorded a new collection of high-pitched shrieks for the game's soundtrack. But what, when we look at Kong, are we screaming at? Perhaps at the sight of our own face in the mirror. \u00b7 King Kong is released on 15 December"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
