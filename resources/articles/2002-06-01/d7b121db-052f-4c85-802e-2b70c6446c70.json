The Nigerian Jay-Jay Okocha has been snapped up by Bolton on a free transfer and Cameroon's Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9 has signed a one-year loan deal with Manchester City. Okocha, who quit the international scene after Nigeria's disappointing showing in the World Cup, has signed a two-year deal with Sam Allardyce's side after seeing out his contract at Paris St-Germain. The 28-year-old playmaker initially wanted a staggering \u00a370,000 a week to sign on at the Reebok but Bolton's chairman Phil Gartside has managed to attract the midfielder with a \u00a335,000-a-week deal. Allardyce clearly believes Okocha is worth the money. \"I'm absolutely delighted to bring Jay-Jay to Bolton Wanderers. Other clubs in other countries would like him but he wants to play in the Premiership. He is a player with tremendous ability and one of great experience at domestic and international level. He'll be a marvellous addition to our team.\" That team would be complete, in the eyes of Allardyce, with the addition of the Frenchman Youri Djorkaeff. The former Inter Milan forward helped Bolton avoid relegation after moving to the Reebok on loan from Kaiserslautern in February. With Okocha's place confirmed, Allardyce will step up his efforts to tempt Djorkaeff back to the club and is hoping to conclude a permanent deal for the 34-year-old before the start of pre-season training. At Maine Road, the 27-year-old Fo\u00e9 has turned his back on Champions League football with the French league winners Lyon to sign a \u00a3555,000 deal with City with a view to a possible permanent move to the Premiership newcomers. City's manager Kevin Keegan believes the former West Ham midfielder will be vital to the Blues' hopes next season. \"Marc has been a long-term target and an absolute key to what we want to do,\" he said. \"He is a tremendously important signing for us. The others, such as Nicolas Anelka, Peter Schmeichel and Sylvain Distin, are certainly exciting but some signings you know are just right and this one is. And we have an option to purchase him at the end of the season. \"I know he didn't stay long at Upton Park but that was not to do with how he played. If you talk to any of the players who were there, and we have talked to Paulo Wanchope, Eyal Berkovic and Stuart Pearce, they are all very respectful of Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9. \"He has left Lyon and the chance of Champions League football to come here and he wants to play Premiership football.\" Michael Svensson, who was in Sweden's squad in the Far East but did not play, will join his team-mate and namesake Anders at Southampton after the World Cup. The 26-year-old defender is currently with Troyes in France."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
