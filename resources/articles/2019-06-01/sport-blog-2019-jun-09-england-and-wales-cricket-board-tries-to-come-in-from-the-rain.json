It is a spy-parody-caper, in which a cartel of super criminals called things like The Professor and Sawn-off Carlo plan an extravagant international heist during a crucial Ashes game. It was the first thing that came to my mind when the news emerged last week that the England and Wales Cricket Board had met with a shadowy organisation called X. X, as it turns out, are the secretive R&amp;D arm of Google, the shiny, happy Doodle-makers who exist to make the world a better place and definitely aren\u2019t a frighteningly powerful mega-corporation that knows every bad thing you\u2019ve ever done online. The details of the meeting remain classified, but it is thought the discussion involved using new technology to prevent rain interrupting games \u2013 perhaps through the repurposing of the stratospheric balloons that X have been developing to bring wifi to remote rural areas. (See? They\u2019re definitely the goodies.) It is, on the face of it, an uneven match-up. X are helping to bring us driverless cars and have worked out how to store renewable energy in salt; the ECB invented The Hundred. X creates technologies \u201cthat aim to improve the lives of millions, even billions, of people\u201d, which suggests they may not have been completely accurately briefed on the current viewing figures for English cricket. Some may even wonder whether the ECB got the meeting under a false premise. Is it possible that X saw their trademark applications for the Leeds Superchargers and the Trent Rockets and assumed they were experimental technology patents? Still, it shows a charming ambition on the part of English cricket I can\u2019t help but applaud. Maybe it is because I can\u2019t quite muster the cynicism that others feel towards the much-maligned Hundred or because the game\u2019s growing self-confidence is quaintly out of step with its reality, like Buzz Lightyear\u2019s self-appointed mission to save the galaxy from the Emperor Zurg. England\u2019s director of cricket, Ashley Giles, recently said that reinventing the sport for a new generation was not about \u201cwhat people want but what people need\u201d, which at a time of impending Brexit and climate catastrophes seems a tad like overreach. As it is, I\u2019m enjoying cricket\u2019s reinvention as a sport that is prepared to travel to the very edge of its comfort zone (and beyond!). After all, plenty of us who sucked lemons at the notion of Twenty20 are now addicted to its fizzy brand of pop cricket. I haven\u2019t forgotten that when I came to the game in the 1990s there were many fans who still sighed tragically over the invention of \u201cpyjama\u201d cricket, a full two decades after it had proved quite a good idea. For more than a century, our game has clung to tradition with a tenacity that would have impressed a few cardinals at the Vatican. Now, after 100 years as a byword for a notional golden age of conservatism, it has fallen hard for modernity and it\u2019s keen to make up for all those wasted years. Weaning the game off tobacco sponsorship was the work of decades, but it seems to have taken minutes to rebrand the bowling speedometer as \u201cDelivery Speed\u201d and convince Uber Eats to put their logo on it. Or to turn drinks breaks into hydration intervals. Administrators can no longer afford merely to be in touch with the zeitgeist \u2013 they need to be ahead of it, tapping into new audiences and potential markets with the help of a panel of futurists and, possibly, Ian Ward in a VR headset. Cricketing shibboleths are being discarded: even Test matches are no longer assured of their once-irrefutable status as the most important form of the game. Ed Smith, England\u2019s chairman of selectors, has argued that Test cricket should stop concerning itself with mainstream popularity and let itself become the collector\u2019s vinyl to T20\u2019s Spotify playlist. So it is no great surprise that the ECB are seeking out Google\u2019s top boffins. They have already made it clear in the language they use that they\u2019re keen observers of Silicon Valley, even if it\u2019s just the box set version. Last month, the ECB chief executive, Tom Harrison, shrugged off criticisms of The Hundred with the words: \u201cIt\u2019s the same every time there is something that disrupts.\u201d I like to imagine he immediately headed home on a Lime scooter to watch a TED talk. While it is fun to imagine how the meeting might have progressed, it\u2019s even more exciting to consider where it might lead. What could the Googlefication of cricket ultimately look like? I picture the years skipping by in a Russell T Davies montage. 2020: the ECB moves its offices into the underground tunnels beneath Lord\u2019s and begins work on an algorithm that will help spectators select the optimum time to go for a pee break. 2022: MCC announces that 3D-printed bats are now legalised for use. 2025: Chris Gaffaney is the first umpire to volunteer for a bionic ball-tracking implant. Honestly, I am impressed the ECB even got through X\u2019s front door (if they have a door; it\u2019s probably a space elevator). According to its mission statement, the company exists to have a \u201c10x impact on the world\u2019s most intractable problems\u201d. It\u2019s mind-boggling to think that these now include the fact that it sometimes rains when there\u2019s a cricket match on. Especially when other sports \u2013 rugby, tennis \u2013 have solved the same issue with the staggeringly 21st-century invention of the roof."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
