Jerry I'm not sad, but I know it's not going to happen. Tim There's no reason it couldn't. They're American. It's never over until it's over. Jerry It's not going to happen. Tim Fine , but I don't like seeing you this down. Jerry It's just I saw good things for the two of them. Tim I know. Jerry You know how you wish two movie stars would get together. Tim I know. Jerry And then they finally do a a film together, or a even maybe a Christmas film, and it just feels right? I know this would be right. Something draws these two together. Tim They're very different kinds of people. Jerry That could have been the beauty of it. Overcoming differences. Posh man and wilderness woman. Tim Doing what? Jerry I imagined it would be late at night at Number 10. They would be working on something to do with climate change. Tim She doesn't believe in climate change. Jerry Then something with energy. Drilling. Tim But Cameron's all about green issues. Jerry Then something they agree on. Say they're chasing terrorists. What matters is they're up late, dressed casually. Tim In bathrobes. Jerry No, I see them together as politicians. That's all. Tim Cameron does have a very good casual look. Jerry He would have his shirt sleeves rolled up. Tim Probably a blue shirt, one of his light blue ones. Jerry And she might, I don't know, have let her hair down. Tim She's been doing that a lot lately, hasn't she? Jerry And the way I see it it's late at night and they're looking at each other and she gives him one of those winks. Tim He wouldn't wink back? Jerry Of course not. That's not something a prime minister would do. Tim He's not the prime minister yet. Jerry I see him seeing the wink and nodding back. The David Cameron nod. Tim But he's not prime minister. And if he was, wouldn't he be talking to McCain? Jerry Stop. I already feel it's ruined. Tim I thought you envisioned her with Gordon Brown. Jerry No. God no. He doesn't fit into the ... Tim The fantasy. Jerry I wanted just the two of them there. Together. It could have worked, you know?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
