Findings printed in the British Medical Journal from teams of researchers in Canada and Norway might suggest so. In the largest analysis of shift work and heart risk to date, involving 34 studies and more than two million people, while there was mainly judged no direct link to mortality, working shifts was discovered to raise the chances of a heart attack by more than a fifth, with the risk of a stroke rising by 5%. The sharpest increase for coronary events was with night shifts. Previously, shift work has also been linked to conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and long-term disruption of sleep patterns and body clocks. Experts say that this could be resolved by workers being given adequate time (two nights minimum) to recover properly between shifts. Great. Problem solved. But who's going to ensure that this is happening? It seems that the night-shift worker must contend with working in a state akin to constant debilitating jetlag. Furthermore, a night-shift worker is quite probably navigating an unregulated, or scantily regulated, work environment, where nobody needs to care very much about their basic human needs for a minimum of two lovely big sleeps between shifts. Lower socioeconomic status was taken into account in this study, as well as poor diet and other bad lifestyle choices, but there seems to be no overstating the high probability that these may be directly related to shift work. Shift workers are going to be exhausted, therefore they're going to eat like tired people (poorly); exercise like tired people (who's going for a jog after a night shift?); and even, as another study found, drive like tired people (erratically). So, hey, maybe they should stop doing these terrible shifts. Silly people \u2013 they are ruining their health! Well, it would be nice if they could stop. People prepared to take on night shifts are not usually in your high-end social demographic, the kind of people who have \"choices\". Stephen Frears's 2002 film Dirty Pretty Things highlighted the bleak underground world of the illegal immigrant worker. Even away from that, night-shift work remains mainly the province of the immigrant, the poorly educated and low-skilled, students, itinerants, also the working elderly. People such as my father, who, since his redundancy as an engineer, has worked night shifts in everything, from prisons to hotels, in conditions ranging from bad to very good. Night shifts are one of the few types of work a man of his age \u2013 he's in his 70s \u2013 can get in his area, presumably because younger, fitter candidates find it too boring and life-sapping. But my father has been fortunate \u2013 he's not been forced to work in the types of environments many face. Too many shift workers have insufficient or nonexistent unionisation and very few rights in their workplaces. Some are not even \"on the books\". They are the disadvantaged, desperate, powerless and invisible. The notion of employers caring about such people \"resting between shifts\" verges on the farcical. In our flexi-society, it could be argued that many of us experience disorientating schedules, over-working, trashing our systems, sometimes pulling \"all-nighters\". However, this is not comparable to the relentless grinding down of night-shift workers. Considering the shift-workers' lot, these extra dangers to their hearts, although judged \"modest\" by some authorities, are, to my mind, a social disgrace. The main problem is not just the night shifts, and the accompanying possible health issues, but the under-regulated culture of shiftwork per se. Put bluntly, no one cares a jot about them. Perhaps it errs on the dramatic to say that this kind of work is killing people. However, there seems little doubt that, if employment has a food chain, the average night-shift worker must be struggling unseen, disregarded, somewhere at the bottom of it. Janet Jackson, I salute you You know you're past it when you start furiously agreeing with the old person in a row. Such as last week when Janet Jackson was reported to have knocked the phone out of the hand of her niece, Paris, and called her a \"spoilt little bitch\" in broad daylight. Let's be clear: it's never right to knock phones out of hands or call people \"bitches\", especially if it's the daughter of your late brother, creepy, soft-speaking, sparkly gloved megastar, Michael. This is not traditional aunt behaviour. However, my first thought, after prolonged tutting and eye-rolling, was: \"Janet must have been driven to it!\" Oh for the days when, come what may, I would have automatically sided with Paris against her interfering wicked witch of an aunt. When I would have applauded 14-year-old Paris's decision to live alone with her siblings in some highly dodgy \"LA condo meets Lord of the Flies\" situation. When I would even have tolerated the bizarre accusations that her grandmother-cum-guardian Katherine had been abducted by her grown children when, it appears, she merely went on holiday, sat alone in a room, and turned her phone off. For some reason the words: \"Who could blame her?\" spring to mind. Back in the day, I would have always taken the side of Paris; young people were always right because grown-ups sucked, right? I would have tried to understand Paris, to \"connect\" with her. Well, one teenager of my own later, to hell with all that. Now that I'm old, bitter and twisted, yet strangely still juvenile enough to care about stories like these, I look at the Paris situation, and think: \"Yeah, little brat probably had it coming.\" Go Team Janet \u2013 we sour old trouts need to stick together. Kristen Stewart isn't the first to be led astray I've ignored the Twilight franchise \u2013 I can't be doing with vampire-lite. But it's interesting to see Kristen Stewart vilified for cheating on Robert Pattinson by \"making out vigorously\" with her Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders, husband of Liberty Ross and father of two. While it is Stewart's fault, on an important psychosexual emotional level, it really isn't. Stewart is 22, well within the age zone where bad judgment calls are legion. Her fraught appeal to Pattinson in her public apology (\"I love him, I love him\") reeks of helpless, quasi-hormonal melodrama. By contrast, Sanders is 41, an age when he is in control of himself, and could presumably handle the fleeting crush of a young actress. Stewart isn't an idiot, but life experience counts and Sanders has nearly 20 more years of it. It's not a gender issue: as he's older, it was his responsibility to call a halt to what is known chez Babs as \"shenanigans\". Now Kristen has not only lost Pattinson, she's been damned as a home-wrecker, just for a couple of silly snogs. People such as Sanders not only let their families down, but their gullible young cohorts too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
