A mysterious Israeli-based group uses 21 Facebook pages to churn out more than a thousand coordinated fake news posts per week to more than a million followers around the world. It milks the traffic for revenue from digital advertising. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who earlier this year became the first Muslim women to serve in the US Congress, have been singled out for vicious attacks by the coordinated effort. Somali-born Omar is the most frequent target. She has been mentioned in more than 1,400 posts since the network began two years ago. Tlaib has been mentioned nearly 1,200 times. Both totals are far higher than any other member of Congress. Omar and Tlaib are members of a group of progressive women of color known as \u201cthe squad\u201d that also includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. They have been subject to racist insults from Donald Trump. The Guardian uncovered contacts between a group of mysterious Israel-based accounts and 21 far-right Facebook pages across the US, Australia, the UK, Canada, Austria, Israel and Nigeria. The posts exacerbate Islamophobia by amplifying far-right parties and vilifying Muslim and leftwing politicians. Their content is a blend of distorted news and pure fabrication. An analysis by Queensland University of Technology\u2019s digital media research centre indicated a single entity is coordinating the publication of content across the Facebook pages. Using web archiving services and domain registry information, the Guardian has been able to confirm a key figure in the network is Ariel Elkaras, a thirtysomething jewelry salesman and online operator living on the outskirts of the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. Several of the network\u2019s websites were either taken down or had large amounts of content removed soon after the Guardian approached Elkaras for comment. Public posts on his Facebook profile were also deleted. Elkaras did not respond to multiple requests for comment via email and phone, but the Guardian was able to track him down in the Israeli town of Lod, near Tel Aviv, where he denied involvement in the network. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing related to me,\u201d he said through a translator. The uncovering of the network is likely to fuel concerns that Facebook is failing to tackle disinformation and hate groups ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election in the US. Abbas Barzegar, director of research and advocacy at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said: \u201cSpreading disinformation and faux-reporting through pre-networked social media accounts and pseudo-news websites has been the preferred tactic of the Islamophobia industry for a very long time. \u201cThese actors create entire media and information ecosystems that inscribe dangerous ideas and narratives in audiences across the world. The impact isn\u2019t personal prejudice, alone. Rather, such disinformation impacts our political climate, actual laws, policies and overall culture.\u201d Somali-born Omar, the first member of the House of Representatives to wear a hijab in the chamber, has been subject to hundreds of online death threats. In September she accused Trump of putting her life at risk after the president retweeted a post that falsely claimed she partied on the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Omar told the Guardian: \u201cAs this report makes clear, foreign interference \u2013 whether by individuals or governments \u2013 is still a grave threat to our democracy. These are malicious actors operating in a foreign country, Israel, spreading misinformation and hate speech to influence elections in the United States. The goal of these anti-Muslim hate campaigns is clear \u2013 they put Muslim lives here and around the world at risk and undermine our country\u2019s commitment to religious pluralism.\u201d She also slammed Facebook for its role in allowing users to spread misinformation. \u201cI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Facebook\u2019s complacency is a threat to our democracy. It has become clear that they do not take seriously the degree to which they provide a platform for white nationalist hate and dangerous misinformation in this country and around the world. And there is a clear reason for this: they profit off it. I believe their inaction is a grave threat to people\u2019s lives, to our democracy and to democracy around the world. \u201cWhen private corporations don\u2019t act, we as a nation need to think seriously about ways to address the spread of misinformation while protecting core values like free speech.\u201d When the Guardian notified Facebook of its investigation, the company removed several pages and accounts \u201cthat appeared to be financially motivated\u201d, a spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThese pages and accounts violated our policy against spam and fake accounts by posting clickbait content to drive people to off-platform sites,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow people to misrepresent themselves on Facebook and we\u2019ve updated our inauthentic behavior policy to further improve our ability to counter new tactics. \u201cOur investigations are continuing and, as always, we\u2019ll take action if we find any violations.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
