Various ingredients are hurled with gleeful abandon and beauty emerges from what could initially seem like chaos. Here, drummer Garrett Koloski fires off a deconstructed disco beat while keyboard players Emily Shanahan and Randall Coon emit twittering bird noises and what sounds like the hypnotic hum of an electric pylon. Stagefront, singer/guitarist Catherine Elicson shudders with her instrument, her jerkily melodic chords and sweet, delicate vocals bringing focus and pop melodies to what could otherwise be a glorious haze. This approach \u2013 showcased on their recent debut, Active Listening: Night On Earth \u2013 has led Rolling Stone to call them \u201cAmerica\u2019s most inventive young psychedelic band\u201d and made the effervescent quartet one of the buzziest bands in US indie. In the UK, they\u2019re under the radar and playing above a pub to 20 people, but the noise-pop quartet certainly offer something refreshing. Their anarchic maelstrom is similar in spirit to Nick Cave\u2019s Birthday Party and Captain Beefheart\u2019s Magic Band, although musically they sound like neither. Hulking drummer Koloski is pivotal. All vest, sweat and tattoos, the big man pounds a kit half his size, fires off machine-gun drum rolls and at one point is audibly, loudly cackling as the band\u2019s exultant racket becomes a punk rock take on bebop jazz. However, at the core are some sharp, infectious pop songs, initially written on acoustic guitar but which now rifle through the genres. Electronic riffs collide with church organs and surf punk. Fairground, whirling synths propel the catchy pysch-pop Soft Shape and the slightly Cure-like Hanging Out of Cars, the latter\u2019s lyric (\u201cHanging out of cars on the freeway\u201d) capturing their free-spirited outlook. Roses That Cry channels 1960s girl groups into Sonic Youth with such joyous effervescence it\u2019s impossible not to smile. Elicson, sporting a chic, short mullet, doesn\u2019t say a word all night beyond a mumbled \u201cThank you\u201d, but her band walk off to considerable applause and surely bigger things. \u2022 At the Hug &amp; Pint, Glasgow, tonight, then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
