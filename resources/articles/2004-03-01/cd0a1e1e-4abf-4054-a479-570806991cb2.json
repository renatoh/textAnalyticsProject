You can bet both teams will have spent hours poring over the videos and sorting out their game plans because the lineout has become the main area of conflict in top-flight rugby. Win it and you are well on the way to victory. Lose 11 of your own throws as England did against Ireland and you are in deep trouble. As the rewards get bigger, so too do the the risks. The throw to the front is the safest of the lot but the pay-offs are smallest. Unless the thrower tries something tricky like a peel around the front, the only real option is to catch and drive. Try anything else and the opposition flankers are free to attack your midfield; drive the ball and they have to stay involved. This is the best defensive option or, if calls are changed at the last minute, is the likely default throw. The ball to the middle balances risk and reward. The throw should not be too difficult and although it is a hotly-contested area the jumper who calls the throw has the advantage of knowing what to expect. The opposition back row has to be involved so once the jumper has taken the ball he can either drive or set the backs away. The ball to the back is high risk, but potentially has the greatest rewards. Because of the length of the throw the opposition sees the ball for the greatest period of time and any fault is magnified. But a clean catch can put the backs away with little risk of the opposition back row arriving along with the ball."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
