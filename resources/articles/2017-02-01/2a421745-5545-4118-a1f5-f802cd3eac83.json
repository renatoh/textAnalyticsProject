(Gotham City is said to be built on thin planks over a void that smells of \u201cdirty laundry\u201d. Like a kid\u2019s bedroom, maybe?) The Lego Batman Movie might even rescue DC\u2019s battered reputation and persuade audiences to feel good about Suicide Squad, Harley Quinn and the idea of Batman fighting Superman. In a world made of Lego bricks, Batman \u2013 voiced with basso profundo severity by Will Arnett \u2013 is a super-successful crime fighter who battles terrible loneliness back at Wayne Manor: superb scenes of poignant emptiness. This film incidentally has the most devastating use of Harry Nilsson\u2019s One (Is the Loneliest Number) since Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Magnolia. The Joker (Zach Galifianakis) is wounded by Batman\u2019s refusal to commit to an exclusive hero-villain combat relationship: Batman hurtfully says that he prefers to \u201cfight around\u201d with Bane, Superman and the like. So Joker devises a wicked plan that forces Batman to swallow his loner pride and ask for crime-fighting help from his stepson Dick Grayson (Michael Cera), butler Alfred (Ralph Fiennes) and new Commissioner Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson). It\u2019s packed with gags and smart allusions. Why can\u2019t non-Lego movies be as funny, exciting and weirdly moving as this?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
