How Anil Kumble must wish the same could be said of those in Guildford. A sticky wicket would have suited the Indian legspinner just fine on his long-awaited Surrey debut. Instead it was his misfortune to cross swords with Justin Langer on the sturdiest strip of Tarmac in southern England. By the close of a sweltering first day, Langer still seemed the coolest man in the county as he reached 234 not out, the highest first-class score ever made at Guildford, and just seven shy of his previous-best in the Championship. It was a brilliantly determined knock that made a mockery of Somerset's lowly position in the table, not to mention Surrey's runaway status at the top. Langer faced 279 balls with 31 fours and two sixes, and his placid experience coaxed the best out of two young team-mates: Neil Edwards, a 22-year-old Cornishman who contributed a classy 77 to an opening stand of 227, Somerset's first in excess of 100 all season; and Arul Suppiah, also 22, whose 71 from 138 balls included the shot of the day, a pulled six off Ian Salisbury that landed in the forecourt of a nearby petrol station. Langer emulated his recent pyrotechnics in the Twenty20 Cup, as he rattled to his first hundred at nearly a run a ball. What Somerset would give to prolong his five-week stint, which ends next Wednesday in a Pro40 knockabout against Kent Another, more emotional, farewell was denied to the Guildford crowd when their most famous old boy, Martin Bicknell - in his 20th and final first-class season- was omitted from the Surrey line-up. \"I was desperate to play,\" he admitted, \"but you don't get many fairytales in sport.\" On reflection, as he watched Rikki Clarke resume after tea with some speculative and rarely-seen offbreaks, he might have been secretly relieved to have taken refuge in the hospitality tent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
