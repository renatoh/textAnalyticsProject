The strict conditions had been labelled \u201cabsurd\u201d by civil liberties campaigners and prevented Ludlam from appearing in court on Thursday, due to restrictions on coming to the Sydney CBD. On Thursday morning in Sydney\u2019s Downing Centre local court, deputy chief magistrate Jane Mottley said the conditions imposed by New South Wales police were not necessary given the low seriousness of his offences. \u201cI note these are fine-only offences,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when one considers the ambit of matters before the court \u2013 these are not serious examples of offences which would ordinarily attract bail conditions\u201d. Ludlam and 29 others were arrested while protesting for action on the climate emergency in Sydney on Monday. The former Greens senator was charged with obstructing traffic, and given bail conditions which banned him from coming within 2.5km of the Sydney Town Hall, or attending future Extinction Rebellion events. According to documents seen by Guardian Australia, other protestors were given even harsher bail conditions that banned them from \u201cgoing near\u201d or speaking to members of Extinction Rebellion. Ludlam welcomed the decision, saying, \u201cI\u2019m glad common sense prevailed.\u201d \u201cThis decision sends a clear message to the NSW police that the bail conditions were wildly inappropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope that the restrictions placed on other arrestees on Monday night will be immediately withdrawn.\u201d On Wednesday, the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties said the conditions were \u201cabsurd\u201d, would affect thousands of people, and infringed on the constitutional right to freedom of political communication. That day, NSW Greens senator David Shoebridge said the conditions were so extreme NSW police \u201cknew they would be thrown out of court\u201d. On Thursday morning, magistrate Mottley dismissed the conditions and gave Ludlam unconditional bail. In arrest documents, NSW police stated that protesters \u201cif released from custody, will endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community [and] interfere with witnesses or evidence\u201d. But Mottley determined that these could \u201cbe appropriately addressed by unconditional bail\u201d. If the conditions had been upheld, they would have applied to Ludlam until 7 November, when the matter was listed for first hearing. The former WA Greens senator was not present in court, as the Downing Centre is within 2.5km of the town hall. Ludlam had been given three bail conditions on Monday: good behaviour, the 2.5km exclusion, and the ban from attending Extinction Rebellion events. Ludlam applied to have only the last two dismissed. In court on Thursday, crown prosecutor Wayne Law said police believed there was \u201can unacceptable risk\u201d that Ludlam and other protestors could cause harm to the community. \u201cThe objective [of Extinction Rebellion] is to cause civil disobedience [for] their political agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cThose conditions imposed address that issue, which is to prevent further civil disobedience. \u201cThe endangering of safety is effectively that they lay on the road which is a great concern to themselves \u2026 but also the community.\u201d But Ludlam\u2019s lawyer Greg James said the conditions were aimed at \u201cstifling legitimate political protest\u201d. \u201cThe road was closed, there was no traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that they can\u2019t contact others involved in a political movement show extraneous conditions were taken into account. There is no bail concern at all.\u201d Outside court, Shoebridge said police should now drop the conditions against other protesters \u2013 who were in some cases, given harsher restrictions than Ludlam. \u201cThere are at least 30 protesters that have these unreasonable conditions imposed upon them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police can either remove them voluntarily or we can waste all the court resources, all the police resources, all the time of the protesters in coming down and knocking them off one after the other.\u201d On Wednesday, the president of the NSW Council of Civil Liberties, Pauline Wright, told Guardian Australia these conditions were usually reserved for members of bikie gangs. On Wednesday, Ludlam told Guardian Australia that if the government wanted to stop climate protesters, they should take action on policy. Not all protestors arrested on Monday were given bail conditions, with some released unconditionally."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
