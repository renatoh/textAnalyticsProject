One of them has also attacked the National Enquirer for allegedly suppressing a 2005 interview with her in exchange for an exclusive from Cosby about his daughter\u2019s drug use. Beth Ferrier and Rebecca Lynn Neal were unidentified witnesses \u2013 known as \u201cJane Does\u201d \u2013 in a 2005 case in which Cosby was sued by Andrea Constand, the first of more than two dozen women to come forward with allegations of sexual abuse against the comedian. Last week a judge granted a motion by the Associated Press to unseal part of Cosby\u2019s deposition. Constand has now been joined by Ferrier and Neal in a motion to have the rest of the deposition, which has so far been barred from public view, unsealed. In a statement Gloria Allred, the lawyer representing both Ferrier and Neal, said she was concerned the partial testimony, \u201cif believed\u201d, would cause reputational damage to her clients. \u201cAfter reading Mr Cosby\u2019s statements in the deposition, I am surprised that he says that he doesn\u2019t remember me,\u201d said Neal in a statement on Monday. \u201cI saw and spoke to Mr Cosby for weeks and weeks at the health club I worked at in Las Vegas. He played tennis there. He even called my mother\u2019s home and talked to her and her sister that was visiting from Texas. \u201cI was at my sister\u2019s home years later after he drugged and sexually assaulted me, and I told her what had happened to me,\u201d Neal continued. \u201cThat was around 1986. Up until then, I hadn\u2019t told anyone about what had happened to me. I was embarrassed by it all.\u201d In her own statement, Ferrier said: \u201cIt is important for the world to know the truth about how Bill Cosby hunted me like a predator. \u201cMy refusal of his constant advances fuelled his desire and eventual drugging rape ritual. In the recently released excerpts of his deposition, Bill Cosby admits that he was with me in Denver and that he \u2018probably\u2019 had sex with me.\u201d Both Ferrier and Neal have told their stories to the press since the Constand lawsuit. However, while it was known that Ferrier was one of the Jane Does in the case, it was not until Monday known that Neal also was one. Allred told the Guardian that after Constand settled the suit, and the court proceedings were sealed, Ferrier tried to tell her story to the National Enquirer, which pulled the story after Cosby offered them an exclusive about his daughter\u2019s drug use. In her statement, Ferrier said she was speaking out not just against Cosby, but also against the Enquirer. \u201cI am extremely upset that Bill Cosby was able to quash my interview with the National Enquirer and that the National Enquirer suppressed my story, which if it had been published by them, would have shed light on Bill Cosby\u2019s horrific conduct years earlier,\u201d she said. The owner of the National Enquirer, American Media, issued a statement in response to the allegations last week. \u201cThe National Enquirer, more than any other publication, was unflinching in our aggressive coverage of allegations against Mr Cosby beginning in 2000 when everyone else avoided the story,\u201d a spokesman told the Wrap. \u201cWe continue to remain aggressive in our reporting today and stand by the integrity of our coverage of this story which we have taken the lead on for more than a decade.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
