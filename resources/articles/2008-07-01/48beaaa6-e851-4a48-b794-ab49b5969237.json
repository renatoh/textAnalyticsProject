Welcome to Latitude, Britain's most middle-class music festival. The Royal Court theatre is here, as are Sadler's Wells dancers. Hanif Kureishi is talking in one tent and Mark Lamarr is hosting his own night in another. It's enough to keep the Sunday newspaper review sections in material for months. The weather, of course, made its presence felt. Despite good forecasts earlier last week, the rainclouds turned up. But the sun shone brightly between the showers, there were no Glastonbury-style mudbaths and - fortunately - wellington boots are still very much in vogue for the discerning festivalgoer. The annual festival at Henham Park estate, near Southwold in Suffolk, began on Thursday evening and concluded with a headlining set by New York indie rockers Interpol last night. In between, it played host to talent from the worlds of music, literature, comedy, theatre and dance. Latitude, which is in its third year, bills itself as \"more than just a music festival\". On Saturday lunchtime they were already congregating at the comedy tent in anticipation of Bill Bailey's 3pm performance. Down the hill, in the literature tent, you could hear poet Simon Armitage read from his latest book, while over in the film and music arena a Q&amp;A with screenwriter Patrick Marber was in progress, in which he discussed his career, including the adaptation of Ian McEwan's novel Saturday that he is currently working on. Both Armitage and Marber said they only became writers after failing to become rock and roll stars. Other notable performers included novelist Esther Freud, poets Carol Ann Duffy and Adrian Mitchell, comedians Stewart Lee, Ross Noble and Phill Jupitus, actors from the National theatre and DJs from the Guilty Pleasures club night. Latitude prides itself on being a family festival and the unobservant individual was as likely to trip over a stray toddler in the scrum in front of one of the stages, as over a guy rope on their wobbly way back to their tent. A lavish children's arena was laid on, complete with its own flock of pink and purple-coloured sheep. But no show was complete without a smattering of children hoisted aloft onto shoulders, getting their first lessons in proper fists-in-the-air appreciation of live music. The beautiful, wooded and gently undulating grounds were the perfect setting for art trails, guerrilla gigging (a piano by the lake with a sign saying \"play me\") and, when the clouds parted, sunbathing. It was at night, however, that the festival really came into its own, with the trees and water illuminated by strings of fairy lights, fantastical projections and multicoloured beams playing through the leaves. At sunset, dancers took to a stage on the lake and clearings in the trees became the setting for midnight discos. Musical highlights included a typically stylish set on the Obelisk arena main stage from Franz Ferdinand, who got the crowd bouncing along to Take Me Out even as they were swathed in Friday night's drizzle. In the Uncut arena on Saturday evening, 90s indie band The House Of Love, recently reformed, seemed genuinely touched as fan roared their approval of old songs. Elbow rounded off a barnstorming set with rousing version of \"One Day Like This\" (\"One day like this a year/Would see me right\") as the sun broke through the clouds. Yesterday's proceedings were kicked off by singer-songwriter-harpist Joanna Newsome, who attracted a chilled-out lunchtime crowd and won them over by repeatedly forgetting the words to one of her own songs. \"You shouldn't applaud,\" she told the audience, when they cheered her every time she stumbled. \"You shouldn't encourage this.\" But the weekend belonged to the Icelandic band Sigur Ros, who took to the main stage on Saturday night as the sky finally cleared for good. Their lush, dreamlike music - fortified by a white-suited and bowler-hatted brass ensemble - rolled over the crowd and the thousand little lights of mobile phone faces, as above them the stars came out and a yellow moon rose over the trees. Down by the lake an overspill crowd was listening to a late-night poetry reading. And in the woods, a party was starting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
