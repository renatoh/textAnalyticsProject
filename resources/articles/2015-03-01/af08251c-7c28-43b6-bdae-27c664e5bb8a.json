In deference to a strict separation of powers, and in keeping with a strong tradition of parliamentary sovereignty, the Commonwealth has steadfastly refused to adopt a judicially enforceable bill of rights. Instead, non-government bodies like the Human Rights Commission and parliament are left to defend our liberty. The government has recently publicly criticised the Human Rights Commission and Gillian Triggs, its president. Whether or not we accept those criticisms, the Human Rights Commission has been damaged by them. Worryingly, cracks have begun to open in a second significant branch of our human rights infrastructure. The Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 enshrines a form of political rights review whereby parliament is tasked with ensuring that laws comply with human rights standards. The parliamentary joint committee of human rights (PJCHR) is central to that process. To date, the PJCHR has issued 37 reports. The first 33 reports and the most recent report \u2013 tabled in the Senate on 3 March 2015 \u2013 were all unanimous. The final two reports of 2014 and the first of 2015 each contained dissenting opinions. The emergence of dissent is not good. These are critical times for the fledgling PJCHR. If it divides along party lines it will lose all credibility. With it, Australia\u2019s only mechanism for ensuring the compliance of federal laws with international human rights norms will disappear. We must not allow that to happen. Committees \u2013 especially scrutiny committees \u2013 engage in technical analysis of legislation. They work to highlight flaws and on occasions to contribute to the debate. When they function well, the party allegiances of members are largely irrelevant \u2013 members are not subject to the party whip, they can speak frankly, and the resulting reports are non-partisan. The emergence of dissent, particularly repeated dissent, puts that non-partisan reputation at risk. If political parties come to see the PJCHR as contested territory, the committee\u2019s work will be undermined. To date there have been three dissenters: Ken Wyatt (Liberals); Senator Matthew Canavan (Nationals); and David Gillespie (Nationals). Wyatt joined the National party members in dissenting on citizenship issues in a report tabled in November 2014. The two National members dissented on an interpretation of gender equality in the committee\u2019s next report. Canavan has so far been the lone dissenter of 2015 on the right to social security. The report tabled on 3 March marks a return to unanimity. The simplest explanation for dissents is that the members could not bring themselves to agree with the majority opinions. The first dissent concerned provisions within the migration legislation amendment (2014 measures no. 1) regulation 2014 which the majority held were likely to undermine the right to privacy. The provisions allow an individual\u2019s previous names to be recorded on the back of their citizenship certificates. The majority were concerned that such measures could impact upon those who have undergone sex or gender reassignment procedures. The minority rejected this, arguing that citizenship certificates are \u201cfoundational documents\u201d and are different to passports or driver\u2019s licences in that you are not asked to present them to establish identity on a frequent basis. The second dissent resulted from the majority\u2019s interpretation of the right to equality and non-discrimination and the potential impact of the social services and other legislation amendment (2014 budget measures no. 1) bill 2014. The majority were concerned about the potential for some of the measures to disproportionately impact upon women. Canavan and Gillespie objected to \u201cthe blunt and inconsistent application of the indirect discrimination test in the committee\u2019s report\u201d. The most recent dissent was over the resource rent tax repeal and other measures bill 2014. The majority felt the bill might be incompatible with the right to social security and the right to an adequate standard of living. Canavan argued that the tax failed to raise the revenue forecast and as a result it was a legitimate policy objective to repeal welfare measures which were contingent on that revenue. It is possible that Canavan and Gillespie are dissenting due to strongly-held personal beliefs. Perhaps the two National party senators, who were both first elected in 2013, are seeking to demonstrate their independent thinking. There is nothing to indicate that the members are being directed in their dissent by the National party room. Most importantly, other government members of the PJCHR, Fiona Scott and Dean Smith, have not joined the dissenting reports. That has avoided a government/opposition split on the committee, which would be a disaster. In general, the standard of the committee\u2019s work has been good. However, there have been some concerns: the PJCHR\u2019s report on the National Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2014, for example, was not tabled until after the parliamentary debate. And repeated dissenting reports by members of one party puts the reputation of the PJCHR at risk. Particularly if the Nationals are seen to benefit electorally from taking a narrow stance on the scope of human rights. Debate about human rights within parliament is important; but for committee reports, consensus is vital. Without it, the PJCHR will become the play-thing of the political parties. In that context, the appointment of Philip Ruddock to the committee chair last week is welcome. Hopefully he will be a steadying hand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
