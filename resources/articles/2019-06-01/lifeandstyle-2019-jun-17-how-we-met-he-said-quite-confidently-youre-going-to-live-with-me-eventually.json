In his profile, Simon had written that he liked \u201cbooks, beards and cheese\u201d. \u201cI sent him a message saying: \u2018I work in cheese\u2019,\u201d Christian recalls, \u201cbecause at the time I was working for a dairy.\u201d They both laugh. He also had a beard. But, Simon points out, \u201cHe didn\u2019t mention the fact he didn\u2019t really like books.\u201d Both were single and had turned to Twitter to try to meet someone. They liked that it wasn\u2019t a dating platform. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have an expectation,\u201d says Christian. \u201cWe were just two people chatting and getting to know each other.\u201d They exchanged messages for a few days, then spoke on the phone. A couple of weeks later they met \u2013 Simon was moving house and Christian had offered to help move some bookshelves into storage. \u201cHe turned up on the Saturday,\u201d deadpans Simon, \u201cwith a Mini.\u201d Against all the odds, the bookshelves did fit. They had arranged to meet near where Simon was living in Heaton Chapel, near Stockport. Christian, who had driven over from Liverpool, saw him coming down the road, crossed over to meet him, and they happened to meet, romantically, outside the fishmonger\u2019s. \u201cEvery time we drive past now we\u2019re like: \u2018Ah, that\u2019s where we met,\u2019\u201d says Christian. Was it awkward? No, says Simon, \u201cI think because I\u2019d gauged his personality because of Twitter, and we\u2019d both put possibly not very recent photos, but recent enough. It wasn\u2019t like seeing someone you\u2019re not expecting to see.\u201d \u201cIt was just like meeting a person I felt I knew already,\u201d says Christian. What did they like about each other? \u201cIt was just that he made me laugh, and he had a cheeky glint in his eye,\u201d says Simon. Christian says: \u201cI loved his face, and his personality fitted his face because he was as nice as he looked.\u201d When did they realise they wanted to be together? \u201cI think it was really early on,\u201d says Simon. Christian agrees: \u201cFor me it was. People talk about love at first sight. I knew, as soon as I met him, that he was the person I hoped he would be, and that was quite lovely.\u201d Christian had told Simon he might as well store his boxes of books at his house. \u201cHe did say quite confidently: \u2018You\u2019re going to live here eventually,\u2019\u201d says Simon. \u201cI was, like, am I? But actually, we did move in together quite quickly.\u201d About three or four months later, Christian was having his tonsils out and Simon moved in to look after him. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t leave,\u201d he says. That\u2019s quite intimate \u2013 to look after someone when they\u2019re ill. \u201cIt was,\u201d says Christian, who adds that he is a \u201cterrible patient\u201d. \u201cAnd his tonsil wounds reopened,\u201d Simon recalls, \u201cwhich is something to wake up to when you\u2019ve only been with someone a few months and they\u2019ve got blood pouring out of their mouth. It also meant I got to meet his mum and dad quite quickly, at the hospital.\u201d Simon says he knew Christian was serious about their relationship when he half-jokingly sent him a screen-grabbed picture of a kitten he had seen on a listings site with a message saying: \u201cHe\u2019s called Oscar and I think he wants to come and live with us.\u201d \u201cIt was late and Chris hadn\u2019t come home, and I was getting annoyed,\u201d says Simon. \u201cHe phoned me, and I was possibly a bit off with him. He said: \u2018Simon, shush, listen.\u2019 The cat was in the car.\u201d Christian had stopped at a pet shop and bought a cat basket and food, then picked the kitten up after work. \u201cHe was reduced,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI came home with a kitten, and we were a little family.\u201d A risky purchase. \u201cIn hindsight I could have thought: \u2018Was that a little bit quick?\u2019,\u201d says Simon, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t because now we\u2019re married and we\u2019re really happy.\u201d And they have another cat. They got married last year and are now doing up a house together. It has a library for Simon\u2019s books. And a cheese room? \u201cNo, I no longer work in cheese,\u201d says Christian. Simon smiles and says: \u201cWhich is a slight sore point, but has not been too much of an issue.\u201d Want to share your story?
