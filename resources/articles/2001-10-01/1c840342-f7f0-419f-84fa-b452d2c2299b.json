At least three Israeli armoured personnel carriers rumbled down the main road of the biblical city towards an army checkpoint at its entrance, witnesses said. Asked about the report, an Israeli security source confirmed: \"The pullout has begun.\" Israeli forces were to have withdrawn from Bethlehem and Beit Jala yesterday but Israel suspended the pullout, citing what it called continued Palestinian shooting in the two areas. The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, gave the go ahead for the withdrawal despite two Palestinian shooting attacks earlier today which killed five people. Two Palestinian gunmen killed four women in the northern Israeli city of Hadera before police shot them dead. The attack followed a shooting near the border with the West Bank in which an Israeli soldier was killed. The Palestinian authority issued a statement condemning the Hadera attack which was claimed by the radical Islamic Jihad group. Commenting on the Hadera incident, Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, told reporters in Gaza: \"We are following this up to find out who's behind this. \"There is a decision in the Palestinian leadership to stop these operations in spite of the continuing Israeli escalation.\" The Israeli army said the gunmen were members of the authority's police force but acted on behalf of Islamic Jihad. Raising the spectre of Israeli retaliation for the shootings, the prime minister's office said in the statement he also \"stressed the importance of continuing to carry out operational activities\" in the face of the strikes. Israel had deployed forces into and around six Palestinian cities, including Bethlehem and neighbouring Beit Jala, on October 17 after the assassination of the far-right cabinet minister, Rehavam Zeevi, by Palestinian gunmen. The United States, which has been trying to calm a year of Israeli-Palestinian violence as it pursues an anti-terror military campaign in Afghanistan, brokered the Bethlehem pullout deal on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
