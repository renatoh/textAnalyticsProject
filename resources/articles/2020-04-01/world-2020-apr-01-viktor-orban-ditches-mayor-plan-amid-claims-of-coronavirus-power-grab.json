On Monday, Hungary\u2019s parliament passed a law that gives Orb\u00e1n the right to rule by decree for an indefinite period and also criminalises intentionally spreading false information about coronavirus with up to five years in prison. The move was roundly criticised by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s domestic and international critics. It was followed up by a bill of further measures published late on Tuesday evening that would target municipal authorities and mayors, many of whom are from opposition parties. During the state of emergency, mayors can take on the decision-making abilities of local councils, but the new regulation would submit these decisions to a review that could take up to five days. The move was immediately criticised as inefficient and unworkable, and later on Wednesday Gergely Guly\u00e1s, the chief of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s cabinet, said the government would not follow through on the measure. Budapest\u2019s mayor, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, had warned that the measures risked increasing the loss of life due to coronavirus. \u201cI think this proposition is dangerous not only for our democracy but it also makes the fight against coronavirus very difficult,\u201d he said, in remarks emailed to the Guardian by a spokesperson before Guly\u00e1s\u2019 announcement. \u201cIf soldiers, policemen and Fidesz delegates have to decide on local government issues they do not even know or understand and have five days to do so, we are losing precious time in saving lives. If this proposition is accepted it could cause the death rate to rise.\u201d Kar\u00e1csony beat Orb\u00e1n\u2019s candidate in elections last October, standing on a platform of a greener and fairer city. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party lost control of a number of big cities, including Budapest, in what was his first significant electoral setback for a decade. As of Wednesday morning, Hungary had 525 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 20 deaths. Opinion is divided on whether the country may avoid the nightmare scenario unfolding in many western European countries currently, due to relatively early restrictions on movement imposed by the government, or whether the epidemic is simply a couple of weeks behind and will soon enter an exponential growth phase. In a sign that even during a pandemic the Hungarian government has not ceased its rightwing culture battle, another part of the bill submitted on Tuesday would make it impossible for transgender people to legally alter their gender. The bill would introduce \u201cgender at birth\u201d into the Hungarian civil registry, in place of \u201cgender\u201d, and make the entry unalterable. Responding to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s power grab, Luxembourg\u2019s veteran foreign minister Jean Asselborn said Hungary should be stripped of its right to take part in the EU council of ministers, the union\u2019s prime decision-making body. \u201cHungary belongs in strict political quarantine,\u201d he told Die Welt. \u201cWe cannot accept the fact that there is a dictatorial government in the EU.\u201d The European commission has come under fire for its muted response to the Hungarian law that failed to mention Hungary by name. On Wednesday, the president of the European People\u2019s Party, Donald Tusk, said the group would have to reconsider its earlier reluctance to expel Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party from its ranks. In an open letter to the EPP - the centre-right political family long accused of turning a blind eye to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s excesses - Tusk said Hungary\u2019s emergency measures were \u201cdisproportionate and inadequate\u201d. But Tusk stopped short of saying that he supported Fidesz\u2019s expulsion and was accused of failing to take a stand.
