During the Fifties and Sixties, Hollywood stars, British actors, German artists and hippie icons caught a beaten-up ferry from Barcelona to lose themselves in the White Island's silent beauty. Deserted beaches, tolerant locals, all-night parties and a slow, measured way of life all contributed to a form of paradise for shattered post-war urbanites. These days, of course, that Ibiza is hard to find - and it costs plenty to find it. The island is criss-crossed by Tarmac, weighed down by concrete hotels and filled with thumping basslines from crowded beach bars. Silent contemplation is only available at expensive yoga retreats - which is why both the smart money and the celebrity money is turning to Ibiza's little sister, Formentera. Barely 15 kilometres offshore, Formentera offers a glimpse of Ibiza's glorious past. It's barely inhabited, with only 6,000 souls clustered into three villages across its 84 sq km. There are few cars, no traffic lights, and the only person who owns enough land to build an airport refuses to do so. As a result, former Ibiza fashionista regulars such as Kate Moss and Elle Macpherson are opting to hire a villa near Formentera's rustic capital of Sant Francesc Xavier, then catch a ferry - or hire a Sunseeker powerboat - to spend their Monday nights in Ibiza's superclub Privilege. Arriving at the port of La Savina from Ibiza - the only way to reach Formentera - it's possible to feel the same beatnik vibe that encouraged Pink Floyd to build a studio there in the Sixties and moved Denholm Elliott and his wife Susan to tears when they first saw the islands in 1962, ploughing through the Med from Mallorca on a steamer. 'As we approached the harbour, the sun was ris ing,' Susan wrote in her biography of Elliott, Quest For Love. 'It was quite the most gloriously exhilarating sight. We both had tears streaming down our cheeks.' When I made the crossing in the hourly, modern, fast ferry, I found a mellow bunch of cyclists, hippies, birdwatchers, naturists and sunseekers. There were way more German and Italian voices than English, as the up-all-nighters in their Union Jack shorts seem to find the unhurried pace of life and sparse bar culture of Formentera's sole resort, Es Pujols, deeply unappealing. To be fair, they aren't the first to eschew Formentera's isolation. The island has had a troubled history, spending much of the last 1,000 years uninhabited - due to raids from North African pirates and occasional outbreaks of plague. While the plague is long since departed, the pirates - Barbary corsairs to be precise - have left their mark. Spanish mainland indifference to the plight of the Formenterencs meant that the islanders had to rely on self-protection. Churches thus doubled as forts, offering shelter when the raiders' ships loomed on the horizon. The most imposing example is the Esglesia de Sant Francesc Xavier, standing on the north side of his eponymous town's main square, whose font dates from Vandal times. During the Spanish Civil War Formentera suffered brutally at the hands of Franco's Fascist Falange movement. When the left-wing Popular Front swept to power in 1936, it won Formentera, although Ibiza remained in the hands of the right. Nationalist troops supplied and reinforced by Mussolini's ships and planes eventually attacked Formentera and a notorious Italian platoon who called themselves the Dragons of Death began slaughtering left-wing sympathisers. Eighteen Formenterencs were shot, while at least five died in Nazi concentration camps. Investment in the island stopped, leaving the inhabitants operating at subsistence levels. From 1939 to 1942, Formentera became a concentration camp for political dissidents from mainland Spain awaiting execution. The island's nickname 'the island of women' probably stems from this time. With so many men dead or gone, only the sisters, wives and mothers were left to keep the island's fragile economy going. Formentera's rebellious instinct survived the slaughter. Today the island's green movement is strong and the authorities have pioneered sustainable tourism. Formentera's curious ecosystem deserves this protection. Buffeted by the cool, dry tramontana wind from the north, and hot gusts from Africa, its Sabina pine trees have been so beaten by the wind that they look like twisted old men from Dali's nightmares. Meanwhile, the salt pans - the island's main industry since Formentera was discovered by the Carthaginians - have now become home to marsh birds such as egret, heron, and the European flamingo. They flock to the delicately balanced environment, feeding on brine shrimp alongside black-winged stilt and other waders. This, I reason, clearly explains the preponderance of birdwatchers on my ferry. The hippies, meanwhile, were probably on a pilgrimage to Bob's windmill - the Bob in question being Bob Dylan. He spent time in the commune that took over two windmills near El Pilar De La Mola. Although the commune is long gone, the nearby village still has a counterculture feel, with Wednesday and Sunday art markets boasting handmade jewellery and live bands. Two kilometres away, through flat farmland planted with hardy looking vines, is the Far de la Mola lighthouse, the model for the 'lighthouse at the end of the world' in Jules Verne's novel Journey Around The Solar System . For the less cosmically minded, there's a fine cafe bar nearby, Es Puig, a popular place for the islanders to watch the first sunrise of the New Year. Formentera's real delight, however, is its beaches. The clarity and colour of the water is amazing, and the powdery white sand is usually quiet or, if you're lucky, entirely empty. The best way to get to them is to cycle. The bus network is excellent and car hire possible in La Savina, but pedalling along the green routes, a network of quiet country paths and lanes, seems to recreate a half-remembered scene from some dreamy subtitled movie. The coun tryside is a patchwork of golden wheatfields, vines, carob and fig trees divided by dry stone walls. At the end of most days on Formentera, the canny join a low-key procession to Punta de sa Pedrera, a small, isolated, thumb-shaped sandstone ridge where hippies gather to watch the sunset over Ibiza's spooky rock outcrop Es Vedra. The soft smell of hashish combines with the tang of pine resin and the odd whiff of charcoal from the nearby kiosk selling overpriced fish and beers. As the sun dips out of sight, there's usually some muted applause and then you can see the lights twinkling on Ibiza's hilly southern shore. Behind those hills lurks San Rafael, Ibiza Town and San Antonio, where the clubs and bars are open 24/7. The beauty of Formentera is - and you can read this either way - that Ibiza is a 30-minute ferry ride away. Where the Spanish go Model and actress Esther Ca\u00f1adas was born in Spain and now lives in New York, though she has returned to holiday in Mallorca, staying in a private villa near celebrity favourites Deia and Puerto Andraidx. Elysian Holidays (01580 766599; elysianholidays.co.uk) has many fabulous properties on the island, including Mela, a clifftop villa 30 minutes north of Palma. It sleeps 10 and costs from \u00a31,786 per week. Flights to Palma from Gatwick cost from around \u00a350 with EasyJet (0871 750 0100; easyjet.com). The best of Formentera: Stephen Armstrong's top tips The beaches Try Cala Sahona on the island's west side, Playa Illetas and its neighbour Playa Llevant on the northern peninsula or the Playa Mitjorn, sweeping around a 6km crescent to the south. Where to stay For a cute, boutiquey B&amp;B try Las Banderas (Playa Mitjorn; 00 34 6 0957 7417), but it only has a few rooms; Hostal Bellavista (00 34 971 322255) is more basic but is close to La Savina; the apartments at Pueblo Balear (Playa de Mitjorn; call the neighbouring Blue Bar to book 00 34 971 187011) are smartly turned out. Where to eat Fresh seafood at Juan y Andrea (Playa Illetas; 00 34 6 3093 0913) is served at tables on the beach; Es Moli de Sal (Playa Illetas; 00 34 971 187491) serves a decent range of local dishes in a converted windmill; El Mirador (La Savina-La Mola road, around the 14km sign; 00 34 971 327037) offers great views and good quality food - book ahead; rabbit features prominently on the menu at La Pequena Isla (El Pilar de la Mola; 00 34 971 327068). The nightlife Formentera is not Ibiza - indeed, it's sometimes hard to get a drink after 11pm. Clubs include the Blue Bar (Playa Mitjorn; 00 34 971 187011) and the waterfront 10.7 (Playa Mitjorn; 00 34 971 328485). In high season there's a boat from La Savina at 10pm that takes people to Ibiza's most glamorous club, Pacha, and returns to Formentera at 6am. How to get there Flights to San Antonio from Heathrow with British Airways (0870 850 9850; ba.com) cost from around \u00a3240 return. Take a ferry from Ibiza town to Formentera with Balearia (00 34 902 160180; balearia.com) for \u20ac18pp. \u00b7 Stephen Armstrong is the author of The White Island"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
