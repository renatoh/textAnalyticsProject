She could not have imagined it would spark the most astonishing chain of landmarks that have since been established. An amazing 18 world records have been set in swimming since Coventry achieved her feat - with the men's 50m freestyle going on four occasions - and, despite protestations from many coaches that it is down to individual technique, there is no doubting in some people's minds that it is linked to the new Speedo Fastskin LZR Racer bodysuit. Britain's Mark Foster, 37, six times world champion and 10 times European champion, has come out of retirement to contest the British Olympic trials which are taking place in Sheffield this week, and the world short-course championships which are being hosted by Manchester next week. He is convinced that it is linked to the suit. \"OK, it's Olympic year, and people always expect times to come down, but not like this,\" Foster said yesterday. \"I know a lot of the people in this event and it's not possible to say that these times would have been done without the Speedo suit. It's having an unbelievable effect.\" Fina, the sport's world governing body, approved the suits last year, although it is planning to meet the manufacturers in Manchester next week to discuss the incredible sequence of events since Coventry broke her record on February 16. Shortly after Coventry had set the ball rolling, the Australian Eamon Sullivan recorded a new best in the 50m freestyle to become the fastest man in the world. Sullivan was ranked just eighth in the world last year and was not the most obvious man to break Alexander Popov's world record. His coach, Grant Stoelwinder, put the improvement down to technique. \"He's taking two less strokes on the way back and one less on the way out,\" said Stoelwinder. In the pool yesterday, meanwhile, Jemma Lowe, who broke the British 200m butterfly record in the heats on Monday night, guaranteed her place in the Olympic team with a final victory in 2:07.61. All the finals at the Olympic trials this week in Sheffield are being held in the morning to mirror the Olympic schedule in Beijing. In the other three finals decided yesterday, David Carry won the 400m freestyle, Gregor Tait took the 100m backstroke and Caitlin McClatchey was successful in the 100m freestyle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
