Given that head-start, his seven-year absence from the recording studio has been surprising. But the traditionally swaggering tenor-sax tone with a soulfully imploring contemporary edge is still fully functioning on this new quartet set with pianist Andrew McCormack and the fine Jazz Jamaica rhythm duo of bassist Gary Crosby and drummer Rod Youngs. There's plenty of Coltrane-driven orthodox-postbop that largely avoids the rhythmically byzantine nu-jazz challenges of recent years. However, Baptiste's Caribbean and South American roots furnish the musical and extra-musical agendas he so often combines \u2013 reflected in the Sonny Rollins-reminiscent calypso Special Times, the group energy of the title track (dedicated to the civil rights struggles of his parents' generation), and Jamaican-born bass legend Coleridge Goode's spoken reminiscences purring over the clamour of the quartet. Baptiste's melodically sinuous The Long Night contains most of the album's boldest surprises, but if the set isn't as thematically memorable as Let Freedom Ring, it's still good to have Baptiste back on disc."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
