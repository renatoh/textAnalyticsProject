These days, fans of the biggest movie and TV franchises can discover depth and texture in the lives of their favourite characters with a wealth of tie-in fiction. The novels aren\u2019t just movie adaptations, spin-offs or fan fiction, they\u2019re added to the canon of the film or TV series that inspired them \u2013 stories that haven\u2019t made it to the screen but are officially part of those universes. The latest is Darkness on the Edge of Town, a novel by Adam Christopher set in the world of Netflix\u2019s horror series Stranger Things. Christopher\u2019s novel moves away from the series\u2019 fictional town of Hawkins and goes back to the 1970s, when police chief Jim Hopper was a cop in New York City. The third series of the TV drama is due in July, so when the US publisher Del Rey approached Christopher with an idea for a story about Hopper hunting a serial killer, he had to make sure the novel was a perfect fit in terms of tone and continuity. \u201cMy editor and I worked closely with the Netflix team \u2013 including Paul Dichter, one of the staff writers \u2013 to get everything aligned with the TV show,\u201d Christopher says. \u201cAs with any licensed work, there are a lot of eyes on it, and there are a lot of channels it has to go through for comment and approval \u2013 everything from the way the characters speak to detailed timelines is talked about and confirmed.\u201d It may be easier work for writers \u2013 like Christopher \u2013 who are already fans, but he says it\u2019s crucial not to get too close to your material. \u201cA story can easily become too fannish and you can get lost in minutiae that just turn readers off, so you have to know where to draw the line. You have to be true to the property, but you\u2019re also responsible for writing a compelling narrative.\u201d The American author Chuck Wendig, who has written a trilogy of novels set in the Star Wars universe after Return of the Jedi, also counts himself a fan. That may not be an absolute requirement, but for all the freedom writers have to invent new characters and situations, staying faithful to the source material is the bottom line. \u201cThe movies are king,\u201d Wendig says. \u201cEverything follows behind them in Star Wars.\u201d With the lion\u2019s share of money and time devoted to the cinematic versions, writers have to make sure everything moves together at the same time, \u201cnot disagreeing with the films but also not stealing their thunder\u201d. Like both Wendig and Christopher, Jenny Colgan made her name with her own original fiction before she was approached to write licensed novels. Her romance bestsellers have have brought her enough attention to fuel a second writing life as JT Colgan, writing adaptations of existing Doctor Who episodes as well as original novels set in that world. For Colgan the key is to get everything approved in advance. \u201cThere\u2019s no point just going for it and having to throw all the work out of the window if the people at the top have already decided the character can\u2019t swim,\u201d she says. Working within such strict constraints can sometimes be challenging, Colgan continues. \u201cThe most common thing to happen is you hit on something they want to use for the TV show, which obviously takes priority. And when you\u2019re dealing with a long-running property you have to watch for duplication \u2013 there are, for example, not a lot of British historical figures the Doctor hasn\u2019t met.\u201d But there\u2019s fun to be had bending all these rules. \u201cI always feel like I\u2019ve scored something if I get something through \u2013 for example, I got through the way the Doctor smells (a pleasant mix of chalk dust, lime and diesel) and how that stays the same through every regeneration, so I feel that\u2019s my building brick in the universe. And I invented River\u2019s sonic trowel, which then turned up in the telly version.\u201d As the market for tie-in fiction has expanded, so have the ways for fans to voice their enthusiasm or vent their frustration with any new material \u2013 enough to give Christopher pause for thought. \u201cWith a phenomenon like Stranger Things, I was very much aware that was I was creating would become part of the fabric of the show \u2013 officially \u2013 and I also knew that the fans would really be paying attention,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I got something wrong, they would have had no qualms in voicing their concerns.\u201d Fans may be protective of the stories they love, but new stories can also stir up strong emotions \u2013 as Wendig discovered when the first novel of his Star Wars trilogy was swamped with angry reviews. \u201cThe negative feedback can be pretty overwhelming,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me it was complicated by a specific kind of toxicity: fans mad that the book contained \u2018politics\u2019 in the form of LGBT characters or people of colour or what-have-you. I don\u2019t feel comfortable pushing back on people who simply didn\u2019t like the book, but I did feel a certain responsibility to push back against some of that specific brand of toxicity.\u201d Even though they\u2019re working with someone else\u2019s characters, Wendig continues, writers must remember where their duties really lie. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of responsibility writing any story, and that responsibility is first to yourself, I think: telling the best story you can in the way that you choose to tell it. So you can be proud of it \u2013 because though it will say Star Wars, it will also say your name, and so you have to be satisfied with what you\u2019ve done first and foremost. And if you\u2019re a fan of that world you have a standard to hold yourself to, which is: does this please me both as the author of the work and as a fan who might be reading it?\u201d Stranger Things: Darkness on the Edge of Town by Adam Christopher is published by Century.
