Now, with a global pandemic, and the country on lockdown, it\u2019s an arguably perfect time to look back on some of her drawings, which capture the poetry of solitude. To celebrate her work, the New York gallery Hauser &amp; Wirth has launched its first online exhibition, Louise Bourgeois: Drawings, 1947 \u2013 2007, showcasing 14 drawings from the artist\u2019s long career, which spanned seven decades. The gallery is calling it an online exhibit presentation and the drawings are featured alongside a short documentary of the artist in her studio. \u201cIt\u2019s a response to the current situation, in the sense that we\u2019re all glued to our devices,\u201d said Marc Payot, president of Hauser &amp; Wirth. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re not capable of going out into museums and galleries, but we\u2019re still interested in art. This is a possibility to share that.\u201d The drawings on view range from abstract landscapes to strange swirls, black holes and a pair of eyes gazing back at the viewer. There\u2019s a pink butterfly, grass-strewn landscapes and one that simply says: I Love You. \u201cWith drawing, she was capable of dealing with her anxieties,\u201d said Payot. \u201cTo some extent, it has a nice parallel in what we\u2019re all going through, collectively and individually. This selection of drawings is a great mirror for our current day-to-day.\u201d There\u2019s one piece from 1986 called Spit or Star, which depicts two pairs of scissors, large and small, referencing her own family history in the French tapestry business. Often, her reference to the tools of the trade are connected to emotional repair, rebuilding and self-healing. \u201cScissors are an aggressive tool of cutting, but they were also a familiar, tender thing with her family business,\u201d said Payot. \u201cIt\u2019s both.\u201d There\u2019s also a red and blue landscape, Untitled, from 1970, which calls to mind the curves of a woman\u2019s body. \u201cThat\u2019s something repeating throughout her oeuvre, the body,\u201d said Payot. \u201cThis piece is 50 years old, but looks like something out of a young artist\u2019s studio from Brooklyn.\u201d Bourgeois, who was born in 1911 in Paris, started drawing as a child, and helped her parents through the day-to-day of their tapestry business, drawing templates for torn fabrics that needed repairing. Later, after becoming an artist in her own right, her drawings became the starting point for her larger artworks, like her steel and bronze sculptures. But her drawings were also a daily meditation. \u201cThe drawings really had a healing effect, as she was overcoming pain and anxiety through her drawing,\u201d said Payot. \u201cWe all need this, these days.\u201d Though she had her first solo show in 1945 at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York, it wasn\u2019t until the Museum of Modern Art gave Bourgeois a retrospective in 1982, when she was already 70, that she took the art world by storm, riding the wave as a global art star until her death in 2010. Drawings were a daily ritual of the artist, and she used ink, watercolor and pencil to record her thoughts through images and words. \u201cI need to make things,\u201d she once said. \u201cThe physical interaction with the medium has a curative effect. I need the physical acting out. I need to have these objects exist in relation to my body.\u201d In the gallery\u2019s short video (which could very well be the start of a feature documentary), Bourgeois explains: \u201cMy childhood has never lost its mystery, it has never lost its magic and it has never lost its drama.\u201d Fade to black. \u201cIn this video clip, Louise speaks about the importance of drawing to her. It\u2019s very touching,\u201d said Payot. \u201cWhen you do an exhibition online, it can\u2019t just be a couple of images, we needed to add more. It\u2019s the only way to see art now because you can\u2019t go anywhere. For us, it\u2019s a challenge but we\u2019re working with that dilemma.\u201d Bourgeois is known for her giant spider sculptures but has also been called the reluctant hero of feminist art, for taking on the patriarchy, having lived through two world wars and making artwork about motherhood, rather than showing women as naked muses to male artists The main theme in her work is overcoming the trauma of her childhood, though she didn\u2019t always explain herself. She did once say, however: \u201cTo be an artist, you need to exist in a world of silence.\u201d Blocking out the busy New York art world was something she was an expert at. Loneliness didn\u2019t seem to faze her. Payot said that she hosted social gatherings for artists in her studio, where they would discuss artworks, like an old school Parisian salon. Bourgeois would often criticize other artists and their artworks. \u201cThat was her way to communicate and be in touch with the world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most of the time, she was isolated, interested in her work and not anything else.\u201d Though Bourgeois made much of her artwork about her childhood trauma and the complicated relationship between her mother and father, she also made artwork about the years her mother was critically ill from influenza and Bourgeois took care of her (sadly, her mother Jos\u00e9phine died when her daughter was just 22). Drawings were essential to her artistic process. They were often the start to her paintings and prints, even after she turned to sculpture in the 1940s. Some of these works, too, started as drawings. Her most well-known pieces, themed around a spider motif, started out as an ink and charcoal drawing in 1947. Though she kept a written diary and a spoken diary (where she recorded her voice on to a tape recorder), her drawn diary was the most important to her. \u201cHaving these diaries means that I keep my house in order,\u201d she once said.
