We don't have a discrete ICT course at key stage three, so we tend to use it as a problem-solving tool and deliver it through the curriculum. In year eight, for instance, all the pupils do a project to make a clip-together toy, which they design on CAD software then machine out of a flat piece of Perspex. In year nine the children make their own board game, using the computer to generate designs for the board and playing cards, and for the packaging for the outside. It's all about using a computer as a means of production, about enabling pupils to do fancy or intricate work they couldn't otherwise do. Using ICT concentrates on their thinking skills rather than hand skills. Modelling in 3D, for instance, is interesting and enjoyable and you can create lots of fantastic images, but turning them into an actual product you can make on the machine is a different matter. It's quite a high-level activity, and the machine is capable of producing high-quality junk if you let it. It won't make judgments as to whether something is good, bad or indifferent. That said, we don't always use the computer. In year seven, for instance, we do a basic timber-processing project to help the pupils gain some more traditional skills. It's important to get the balance right so it's not just about pushing buttons. Also, as a teacher, you've got to be careful how you plan the computer side, otherwise you end up with a backlog of projects waiting to be milled and lots of children sitting around doing nothing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
