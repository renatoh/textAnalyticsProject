To have a pre-negotiation vote allowing the Scottish government to enter discussions with the UK government and then a post-negotiation vote to ratify the outcome of negotiations between Edinburgh and London would be nonsensical. Not one country in the world has been required to hold two referendums on the road to independence. It seems odd that while the likes of Montenegro (2006), South Sudan (2011) and Iceland (1944) are able to gain their independence through one vote, Scotland should have to hold two. Two referendums also throws up the interesting prospect of what happens if there is a yes in the first vote but a no in the second. Scotland would then inhabit some twilight world, not quite independent, but not quite part of the union either. The UK government has clearly hit new lows in its attempts to stymie the independence bandwagon. Alex Orr Edinburgh \u2022\u2008The exact terms of separation would have to be thrashed out between the two parties. Where, for instance, do we draw the line between Scottish and English waters in the North Sea, and thus the distribution of the oil underneath? What proportion of the national debt would become Scotland's? How is nationality determined? Do I, born and brought up in Scotland, become English? What of the UK's armed forces \u2013 how are they to be divided? In the event of such a separation it would be the duty of any English government to negotiate the best terms possible for its population, even to the detriment of Scotland. In such circumstances, it may be the Scots who are sent home to think again. Philip Cowan London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
