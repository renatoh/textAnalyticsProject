According to family and close friends, Garner suffered \u201cmajor brain damage\u201d from a lack of oxygen. The family was holding out hope of recovery, though, as doctors had registered some brain activity. Garner became widely known in activist circles after her father, Eric Garner, was choked to death by a New York police officer in July 2014. Some media outlets reported on Thursday that Garner was \u201cbrain dead\u201d and had been given no chance for recovery. An unidentified close family associate who had been sharing updates from Garner\u2019s Twitter account rejected such reports. In August Garner, 27, gave birth to a boy named for her late father. She suffered a first heart attack shortly afterwards. Doctors said the pregnancy had put strain on her heart, which was found to be enlarged. Prayers and well wishes have flowed in from throughout the protest and activist community. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said he hoped Garner had \u201ca full recovery\u201d and could \u201crejoin the struggle for justice as soon as possible\u201d. Garner endorsed Sanders during the 2016 presidential campaign and attended a number of rallies. Eric Garner\u2019s death was caught on camera by a bystander, as police attempted to take him into custody on suspicion of the sale of untaxed loose cigarettes. As NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo tried to restrain Garner with a type of chokehold, Garner could be heard yelling \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. His words became a rallying cry of the Black Lives Matter movement and protests against police violence. Pantaleo was not charged with any crime and remains employed with the NYPD. In 2015, the Garner family settled a civil wrongful death suit with the city for $5.9m. Erica Garner became a vocal critic of the NYPD, a frequent speaker and an organizer of rallies, marches and other forms of direct action. Earlier this month, in an interview on the webshow Like it or Not, she talked about the physical toll that organizing and activism can take. \u201cI\u2019m struggling right now from the stress of everything,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause the system, it beats you down.\u201d Garner cited the mother of Kalief Browder, a Bronx teen who was wrongly held in jail for three years and killed himself in 2015, as an example. Venida Browder died in 2016 from complications of a heart attack. Her lawyer said she believed grief and emotional trauma was at least partially to blame. \u201cShe died of a broken heart, she had a broken heart because she kept on fighting for her son,\u201d Garner told Like it Or Not host Benjamin Dixon. \u201cBut I\u2019m not giving up, and this is the fight. I\u2019m in this fight forever.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
