The US army private, who is serving 35 years in military custody for leaking US state secrets to WikiLeaks, has let it be known through her lawyers that she attempted suicide. \u201cShe knows that people have questions about how she is doing and she wants everyone to know that she remains under close observation by the prison and expects to remain on this status for the next several weeks,\u201d the attorneys said in a statement. The comments bring to an end several days of uncertainty in which the US military kept silent about Manning\u2019s condition while she was under medical observation and her lawyers were also unable to clarify what had happened for privacy reasons. Manning\u2019s lawyers, Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union, Vincent Ward and Nancy Hollander, said they had spoken to her after several days in which she was not in contact with anyone outside the military prison. \u201cHearing Chelsea\u2019s voice was incredibly emotional,\u201d the attorneys\u2019 statement said. \u201cShe is someone who has fought so hard for so many issues we care about and we are honored to fight for her freedom and medical care.\u201d But the lawyers expressed their dismay that news of the suicide attempt had leaked out of the military prison without Manning\u2019s permission. \u201cThough she would have preferred to keep her private medical information private, and instead focus on her recovery, the government\u2019s gross breach of confidentiality in disclosing her personal health information to the media has created the very real concern that they may continue their unauthorized release of information about her publicly without warning,\u201d the statement said. The soldier\u2019s medical crisis comes amid ongoing legal action between her and military authorities. In May, Manning filed an appeal against her \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d sentence for the transmission of hundreds of thousands of classified documents to the open information group WikiLeaks. Manning, who is a Guardian columnist, also has a running legal suit in which she is pressing to be allowed to live according to her gender identification, as opposed to the gender she was assigned at birth. She has been given access to hormones and cosmetics while being held captive in a male military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, but is being required against her will to wear her hair cut short, according to male military standards. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255; Trans Lifeline runs a phone hotline staffed by trans people for trans people on 1 877 565 8860. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.
