In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Beyonc\u00e9 accused Feyonc\u00e9 Inc and three individuals, all from San Antonio, of \u201cbrazenly\u201d selling infringing \u201cFeyonc\u00e9\u201d merchandise on their website. The site sells shirts, sweatshirts and coffee mugs bearing the word. The singer said the Feyonc\u00e9 knockoffs confuse consumers and cause her irreparable harm, and that the defendants have ignored her requests to stop. The singer previously threatened legal action against Etsy over a line of coffee mugs also bearing the word \u201cFeyonc\u00e9\u201d. The suit noted one coffee mug in particular that read \u201cFeyonc\u00e9: He put a ring on it\u201d, which the singer said was meant to remind consumers of her song Single Ladies. \u201cDefendants adopted the Feyonc\u00e9 mark to call to mind Beyonc\u00e9 and her famous song,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cDefendants\u2019 conduct described herein is intentional, fraudulent, malicious, willful and wanton.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s lawsuit also seeks unspecified damages. It is unclear whether the defendants have lawyers. One defendant, Andre Maurice, speaking by phone, declined to comment, saying he had yet to review the lawsuit. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s law firm, Pryor Cashman, declined further comment. Reuters contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
