I kicked for the surface but my head banged against something soft. Looking up I could see what looked like rows of yellow tubes - I realised that I was under the inflatable raft. I pushed myself sideways and came up spluttering. Someone grabbed my lifejacket and hauled me back into the raft just as we smashed into another wave. This was my introduction to white water rafting on the Zambezi. We had put in at rapid number 11, just below Victoria Falls. The river was at full flood and the high water meant the upstream rapids were too dangerous: if you went overboard there, you might get sucked into a whirlpool. In fact, there were only a few days left before they were going to have to close the river for the season. I was in a raft with four Dutch guys and our guide. Tamiba was a huge, powerful lad who steered at the back using two long oars. We paddled down the first few rapids smoothly enough and I was beginning to think it was quite easy - when my world turned upside down. Shooting over rapid 16 we hit a wall of water. One of the Dutchmen was plucked out. All we could do was hang on for dear life. The raft was flipped up on its end and I went flying through the air. Bodies barrelled into me, and that's when I found myself underwater and under the raft. Safely back inside and with a bellyful of the Zambezi, I realized we had lost half the crew. The guy who fell out first was miles away clinging onto one of the rescue canoes that paddled with us. After picking him and the others up, we headed off again. I went in twice more before we reached the shore and started the long climb out of the gorge. Despite all the safety precautions, I really did feel I had put my life in danger. It was an immensely exhilarating experience, but not one I'll be quick to repeat. The town of Victoria Falls is pretty commercial. It's a bit like an African version of New Zealand's Queenstown: lots of operators offering all sorts of adrenalin activities. The only difference is that you are constantly hassled by money changers, curio sellers and drug dealers. The fact that there are very few tourists in Zimbabwe at the moment means I get these guys' undivided attention. And boy, are they persistent. In Bulawayo I had perfected a response of \"No thank you, my friend,\" said in my deepest, most authoritative voice. This was supposed to indicate that I was an experienced traveller who was not to be messed, with and that in my case, \"no\" meant no. It didn't wash with this lot. As far as they were concerned, \"no\" meant \"If I wave my wooden mask/animal/stick in your face and shout at you for long enough, then maybe you'll buy it.\" So I crossed the river and the border and travelled to Livingstone in Zambia for a few days. Everyone calls Zambia the real Africa, and Livingstone was much more like a normal working community. The wide streets were full of people milling about, everyone seemed friendly, and lots of people smiled and said hello to me. Reading the local newspaper (more of a monthly parish newsletter), I discovered that there had been a cholera outbreak here three weeks back. I also noted that Mr Mugati had been fined for slaughtering his goat in the street rather than in his shop. There were a lot more backpackers here, and the hostel I stayed in was almost full. People are obviously avoiding Zimbabwe and travelling up and down Africa through Zambia instead. I wandered around the National Museum, which had some interesting David Livingstone memorabilia, including his first-aid kit and some of his letters home. I also went on a game drive round the local park. This wasn't exactly a wilderness experience, as it was only a few miles from town, but I did see white rhino, zebra and warthogs. We were taken round by Don, an ancient English hippy who had bought a truck in Portugal and driven down through Africa in the seventies. Don certainly knew how to find the wildlife, but it was his driving I was more worried about. Stopping ten metres from a grazing rhino, he asked us to shout out if it charged the landrover. \"Now where's reverse on this thing,\" he said. I had planned on travelling overland from Zimbabwe up through Mozambique to Malawi. However, I was told that the recent terrible flooding in Mozambique had washed away the bridges and the buses weren't running. Obviously I was sorry for the poor people who were stuck in the middle of this disaster, but on a more selfish level this was a bit of a blow as it meant I would have to fly from Harare at great expense. Then, after buying the ticket, I kicked myself when I realized I could have gone overland through Zambia for about half the price. Mind you, it's probably just as well I didn't since, if I had, you wouldn't be reading this. When I was there, the email service was down across the whole country. Someone had rung up to find out what was wrong, and had been told that the satellite was broken and it would take a couple of weeks to fix. I had a vision of pot-smoking Zambian spacemen staring at the satellite and shaking their heads sorrowfully. See you by the shores of Lake Malawi."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
