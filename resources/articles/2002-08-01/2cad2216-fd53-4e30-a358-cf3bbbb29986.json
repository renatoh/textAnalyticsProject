He is in the St Leger too, but has got to improve a lot to go for that.\" Rae Guest got off the 13 mark for the season when Marakabei got the verdict under George Duffield in the BBC North Yorkshire Handicap. Duffield drove Marakabei past the front-running Lough Bow just inside the final furlong and kept the filly going well to score by a length. Guest was delighted with the win, explaining: \"She is a first horse owned by Jane Poulter who is a circuit judge from Winchester, but unfortunately she is taking a short break in Sweden at the moment.\" Quiet Times, thought to be lame when virtually pulled up at Doncaster on Saturday, had no problems when making a quick reappearance in the Jerry Scott Radio Show Selling Handicap. Visored for the first time and ridden by Robert Winston, the Tim Easterby-trained gelding got on top of the near side group and was always just holding the challenge of Esatto. Roddy Lappin was suspended for two days (August 14 and 15) for irresponsible riding of a minor nature on fourth placed Maybe Baby. Smart apprentice Dean Corby recorded his first success on the course when Mick Channon's Budelli completed a hat-trick in the Armstrong Memorial Stakes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
