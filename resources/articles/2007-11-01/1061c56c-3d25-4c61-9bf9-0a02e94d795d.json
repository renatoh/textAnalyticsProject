African leaders had threatened to cancel the Lisbon meeting if Mugabe was not invited, while the prime minister, Gordon Brown, confirmed yesterday that he would boycott the summit because of the presence of the Zimbabwe leader. \"I will not be attending this summit,\" he declared at his Downing Street press conference. \"Given the circumstances of the last 10 years and our attempts to give assistance in Zimbabwe, which have been thwarted and resisted, it is not possible for us to attend this summit and sit down with President Mugabe.\" It is expected in Brussels that Mark Malloch Brown, the minister for Africa, will represent Britain at the first Europe-Africa summit for seven years. Mugabe has asked the Portuguese, currently chairing the EU, for a visa to travel to Lisbon, despite being blacklisted by the EU and barred from travelling to Europe. According to sources in Brussels, the Portuguese are certain to enable Mugabe to travel when they issue visas for more than 50 heads of state or government. Britain is not expected to oppose the visa being granted. While other EU countries are unhappy about Mugabe's attendance, Britain is isolated in boycotting the meeting at the top level. Most say there is too much at stake to allow it to be derailed by Mugabe. Portuguese and EU officials sought to play down the Mugabe dispute. \"When the history of the Lisbon summit is written, this issue will only be mentioned as a footnote,\" said Jo\u00e3o Cravinho, the Portuguese official in charge of the summit. \"There is not a single reason for postponing or not having this summit. The time is now,\" said a senior Brussels policy-maker. \"I'm a bit sad that the summit could be taken hostage [by Mugabe]. I would not only be sad, but angry.\" But the expectation is indeed that the 83-year-old will use the summit to exact revenge for years of blacklists and isolation. \"The British fear a handshake,\" Mugabe's spokesman, George Charamba, told Reuters. \"We can't expect timid characters to be where men are.\" EU sources say the Portuguese have drawn up elaborate plans to try to minimise Mugabe's impact on the summit, organising his hotel, meetings, and venues to try to keep him from grandstanding before the television cameras and diverting attention from the meeting. \"They'll be watching very closely to make sure he doesn't hijack the summit,\" said one source, who doubted the Portuguese effort would succeed. France barred Mugabe from coming to a meeting of French and African leaders last February in Cannes, triggering a boycott by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa who is attempting to craft a deal between Mugabe and the Zimbabwe opposition on free elections next year. An EU scheme to appoint a special envoy for Zimbabwe is also being resisted by Mbeki, who is said to be furious that a European could upset his delicate, quiet diplomacy. An official working for Javier Solana, the EU foreign policy chief, has been chosen as the special envoy, but has not yet been named."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
