It includes agriculture and sustainable development but will not have responsibility for transport and planning. So how will Beckett respond to pressing local and international ecological challenges that will determine whether Britain meets its global commitments - and whether Labour fulfils its promises of a sustainable future and agricultural reform? Chris Haskins Northern Foods want steps to improve the public perception of, and confidence in, the food chain, from the farmer through to the manufacturer through to the retailer. In a European context, the time couldn't be better for a major review of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and to start the process of radical change. We see the need to develop policies, under the CAP, which secure safe and nutritious food - which is produced under environmentally friendly conditions. Lord Haskins is chair of Northern Foods plc. Tony Burton The new department provides an unprecedented opportunity to put the environment at the beating heart of farming policy reforms and to recognise the value of the beauty, tranquillity and diversity of the countryside to the nation. It needs to break free from the old structures of Maff and bring new voices into the heart of rural policy-making. And it will have to earn its environmental spurs in debates with Stephen Byers' new department over imminent decisions on the Hastings bypasses, regional housebuilding plans and expected reforms of the land-use planning system. Tony Burton is deputy director of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England. Charles Secrett Defra was cobbled together the day after the election. It has little internal cohesion. Planning and transport have been divorced from environment. These are big mistakes. You must defeat the Maff old guard. Farming must be greened, and local farm produce, family farmers and organic conversion promoted over industrial suppliers, cereal barons and the GMO brigade. In Cabinet, you must take responsibility for greening Whitehall. Sustainability means putting environment action at the heart of all decision-making. You must rein in the multi-nationals, phase out toxic chemicals and make company directors statutorily liable for any environmental or health damage caused by their products. Charles Secrett is director of Friends of the Earth. Fiona Reynolds You must seize the opportunity to champion and deliver new public benefits from the countryside - quality food, healthy water, air and soil, and access to a rich and diverse landscape. This needs not only sustained public investment but a recognition by everyone of the value and importance of the environment to the economy as well as to our quality of life. The foot and mouth outbreak has already shown how rural and urban needs are interdependent. You must work with others to build on these links and deliver root-and-branch change - from the village hall to Whitehall. Mrs Beckett, this is the kind of chance you get once in a generation. Fiona Reynolds is director general of the National Trust. George Monbiot The new department must break the deadly grip of the National Farmers' Union, the superstores and the agrochemicals firms on farm policy in Britain. It should recognise that small farmers trading locally offer the only hope of both sustainable food production and sustainable livelihoods for most of the people now working on the land. It will show that it has not succumbed to the institutional corruption which governed the Ministry of Agriculture only if it reverses Maff's policy of destroying small farms. George Monbiot is an environmental campaigner. Ian Gardner The NFU looks to Defra to assist farmers and growers to recover from their weak financial position caused by the strength of sterling against the euro, coupled with animal disease and weather problems. Defra should play a constructive role in dealing with the environmental issues that surround farming. All involved in this debate need to realise that farmers derive their families' livelihood s from their businesses. Sustainability involves profit. In Europe, we look to Defra to spearhead UK pressure to establish a more market-oriented CAP. Ian Gardner is deputy director of the National Farmers' Union. Tim Lang Maff is dead. Long live Defra! You and your ministers must ignore the siren voices urging inaction prior to business as usual. That won't work. The big challenge is how to make the complex, capital-efficient but wasteful UK food supply chain meet environmental, ethical and health objectives in affordable ways. A new food policy council should be created. The food and farming commissioner, promised in the manifesto, must be really independent. Options need to be explored. Courage! Labour created the visionary Agriculture Act in 1947; today, its task is to be strategic for the 21st century. The mess cannot go on. Tim Lang is professor of food policy at Thames Valley University. Patrick Holden Foot and mouth has forced Tony Blair to catch up with the public and recognise that intensive farming has failed. We need fundamental change, including a new set of guiding principles for the government and the promotion of farming systems that benefit the environment and public health. Mrs Beckett, you must recognise that tinkering with the unacceptable destroys wildlife and threatens health. An action plan is needed for organic agriculture, together with a phase-out of all public funding for farming practices which do not benefit the public. Much more local and organic food should be produced, and there must be no more worshipping at the altar of global free trade. Patrick Holden is the director of the Soil Association."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
