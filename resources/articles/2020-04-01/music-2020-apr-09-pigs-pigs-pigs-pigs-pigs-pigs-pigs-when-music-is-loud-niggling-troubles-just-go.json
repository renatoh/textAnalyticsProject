One night, the trio had a visit. \u201cEveryone suddenly stopped playing,\u201d chuckles singer Matt Baty, who was the drummer in those days. \u201cI looked round and there were two coppers standing in the room. We\u2019d been making full-on noise and they must have come to check out if anything untoward was going on, and they found us.\u201d Thankfully, the local plod didn\u2019t arrest them. \u201cWhen they left they told us, \u2018Keep on rocking,\u2019\u201d grins guitarist Sam Grant. \u201cWhich we have.\u201d Almost 15 years later, after word-of-mouth buzz and BBC 6 Music support, the now five-piece were the festival hit of last summer, playing a hypnotic mix of Black Sabbath-style \u201cprecious metal\u201d and Jane\u2019s Addiction with the repetition-based outsider rock of Can, Hawkwind and Sunn O))). Pigs x7\u2019s tour is on hold due to coronavirus, but see them when they come back around in November \u2013 gigs tend to be incendiary, hard-rocking but awesomely entertaining affairs, with audience members wearing pig masks or clambering on stage and Baty, stripped to his shorts, howling cathartically. \u201cThe policemen asked us, \u2018Is everything all right?\u201d he remembers. \u201cI said no, we\u2019re not all right. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this.\u201d The frontman finds \u201csolace in really loud music. I don\u2019t meditate \u2013 maybe I should \u2013 but it feels like I\u2019m achieving a similar state of consciousness. When the music\u2019s so loud that you can\u2019t think about anything else, all those niggling troubles just go.\u201d Band members talk of getting so lost in their playing that they have felt sick on stage, or come off with clenched jaws. \u201cIt\u2019s therapy through noise,\u201d explains bassist Johnny Hedley. \u201cWhether we\u2019re thrashing about or playing something slow and droney, the variety of expression mirrors how you feel internally.\u201d The mostly short-haired Pigs x7 don\u2019t particularly look like regular metalheads, but discovered Sabbath and Mot\u00f6rhead from their parents\u2019 collections before digging into extreme metal, Krautrock, noise and sonics. I meet them in February in Newcastle\u2019s Trillians Rock Bar, fulcrum of the city\u2019s metal scene for years. Shortly after relocating, Baty had a eureka moment in this very bar, when he came across local noise band Marzuraan, who were making, he says, \u201cbottles shake off the shelves. My eyebrows were vibrating. Downtuned guitars. An awkward uncomfortable guy on vocals. It was a whole new world of music.\u201d Gradually, Baty realised he didn\u2019t want to be the drummer any more, but the frontman, which coincided with a shift to more focused music than the original madcap plan to do \u201clong psychedelic jams, with 10 drummers\u201d, becoming a five-piece instead. They acquired the band name while in Newcastle. The waggish Grant explains that it functions as \u201can ego inhibitor. Having a silly name stops you getting ahead of yourself or hungering for success and keeps you focused on making music you believe in.\u201d Not that it hasn\u2019t caused some issues. \u201cWe get people trying to sell us pigs,\u201d deadpans Sykes, to howls of laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s happened three times recently. A Brazilian guy saw the name on the internet and thought we were a livestock auction. I did ask for photos of his pigs, but I usually try and explain the situation early on, before I find myself ordering a herd of animals.\u201d A chat with Pigs is like their gigs, and careers from hilarity to something more profound. Baty is \u201chumbled\u201d by the fan letters from \u201cpeople reciting lyrics back to me and telling me what they mean to them. Which is astounding, really\u201d. On their new album, Viscerals, the song New Body is about low self-esteem, which \u2013 especially delivered by a guy performing almost naked \u2013 is quite unusual in the metal canon. \u201cThe topless thing started shortly after I switched to vocals,\u201d Baty explains. \u201cHaving been a drummer it was unfamiliar territory, so during early gigs I tried to cover myself up by wearing a kaftan with a hood. Then one night the mic lead got caught in the hood and I ended up with my arms suspended over my head. I thought, \u2018Never again\u2019.\u201d As the gigs became hotter, he found himself unbuttoning. \u201cIt felt symbolic of unburdening. So now I\u2019m down to my shorts, but I\u2019m not going on stage in a loincloth\u201d. Freedom from societal constraints \u2013 whether in clothing, musical convention or health and safety laws on stage \u2013 is a recurring theme. Hedley sees their music as \u201can escape from a period of time where socially things are very difficult\u201d. Many of Baty\u2019s lyrics concern religion. Having been an avid churchgoer in childhood, and attending a Catholic school, three years ago he accompanied his mum to mass for Christmas, and found it \u201creally bleak. Like \u2018Enjoy Christmas, but remember you\u2019re a sinner and you\u2019re going to hell\u2019. It reminded me what I grew up with. I had a lovely childhood but all this is ingrained; I was taught about sin and purgatory, which are very heavy duty concepts for a child to try and process.\u201d He\u2019s at pains to point out that references to the seven deadly sins on 2018\u2019s King of Cowards and new songs such as Crazy in Blood \u201creally aren\u2019t bashing religion. I\u2019m just trying to make sense of why \u2013 aged eight \u2013 I was asking about who we are and why we die.\u201d The singer has a theory about why audiences are connecting with his band\u2019s catharsis-through-precious-metal. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s an arc,\u201d he decides. \u201cAt the start of life, you\u2019re dealing with grand ideas and \u2018the world is bigger than me\u2019. Then at the end of your life you\u2019re dealing all this again, sometimes assisted by religion. And in the confusing middle of life \u2013 which is where we are \u2013 there\u2019s us.\u201d \u2022 Viscerals is out now on Rocket Recordings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
