The 22-year-old Yamatji woman died in a police lock-up at the mining town of Port Hedland, 1,650km north of Perth, Western Australia, in August 2014 from septicemia caused by a rib broken some months earlier. Dhu, whose first name is not used for cultural reasons, was allegedly abused by her partner, Dion Ruffin, who told the inquest in November that her rib broke in a \u201ctussle\u201d, which he claimed Dhu started. But the Death in Custody Watch Committee WA, which will make submissions to the inquest, say police failed to treat her as a victim of domestic violence and instead arrested and booked her into custody alongside her alleged abuser. Ruffin was arrested after police received a tipoff that he had breached his bail conditions and Dhu was picked up for $3,622 in unpaid court fines. \u201cThe lesson from Ms Dhu to women, particularly Aboriginal women in WA, is that if you are a fine defaulter you had better not complain about domestic violence,\u201d said the human rights lawyer George Newhouse, who is acting for the Deaths in Custody Watch Committee. \u201cBecause you will be arrested, and you could die.\u201d Sixteen police officers working in Port Hedland on the weekend Dhu died are scheduled to give evidence at Perth magistrates court over the next 10 days, capped off by an assistant commissioner, Duane Bell, who is expected to tell the coroner what changes police have made since Dhu\u2019s death. All 11 police officers in the chain of custody were found to have failed to comply with police procedures after an internal investigation, the inquest heard last year, but none were fired or suspended from their role. Hannah McGlade, deputy chair of the Deaths in Custody Watch Committee, said that record would have to change if WA police wanted to address the systemic racism that she says contributed to Dhu\u2019s death, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t have change unless we have action at that individual level.\u201d Dhu\u2019s grandmother, Carol Roe, and mother, Della, have travelled from Geraldton for the inquest, and will hold a smoking ceremony outside court on Monday morning with other family members and the Noongar elder Uncle Ben Taylor to prepare themselves for the week ahead. Dhu was taken to hospital three times in her 43 hours in police custody and died on the third visit. Eleven hospital staff who saw her, plus assorted medical experts, gave evidence in November. Shaun Harris, Dhu\u2019s uncle, said the gap between the first and second lot of hearings made him even less confident that he would hear the truth of how Dhu died. \u201cHopefully we can make history \u2026 so that [Dhu] can rest in peace, poor girl.\u201d Listed among the causes for his scepticism was the announcement by the Barnett government two weeks ago that the promise to implement a custody notification service, for which Dhu\u2019s family has campaigned, had been watered down and delivered as an expansion to the Aboriginal prison visitors scheme. \u201cIt\u2019s just tokenistic crap so they can get more back pats from the broader community,\u201d he said. But a bright point has been an art project to project images of Dhu and her grandmother, Carol Roe, on to the walls of prominent Perth buildings, including two inner-city police stations. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Harris said. \u201cActually, it\u2019s awesome. It gives you a good feeling inside. You get that little bit of support to try and go on.\u201d The project, run by a group who describe themselves as \u201callies of Ms Dhu\u201d, has attracted the attention of the #sayhername and #blacklivesmatter movements in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure that this doesn\u2019t slip under the rug, that she won\u2019t disappear in the ways that settler colonialism wants to disappear Indigenous peoples,\u201d said a University of Western Australia senior history lecturer, Ethan Blue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
