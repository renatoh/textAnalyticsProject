The Sky Blues could net \u00a33m from the sale of the England Under-21 defender but are furious that a player who started the season in their team will now be competing against them and have called for a change in Football League rules. \"I find Tottenham's action totally unacceptable,\" said the Coventry chairman Mike McGinnity. \"What they have done is disgraceful, especially as we thought they might send the player out on loan and asked them to let us keep him until the end of the season. Obviously there's nothing we can do about this but a change in the rules is necessary. What other business would allow one of your assets to end up with a competitor under these circumstances?\" Spurs, however, remain unmoved by McGinnity's anger. \"It was important that Calum went on loan to a club where he would get first-team football to enhance his experience,\" said Frank Arnesen, Spurs' sporting director. \"It was equally important that the move was to a London-based club so that he would not have to relocate again.\" The Football League spokesman John Nagle confirmed there was nothing in the rules to prevent such a scenario but said clubs could propose changes to them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
