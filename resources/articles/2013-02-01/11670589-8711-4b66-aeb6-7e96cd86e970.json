That is why there is a perennial requirement, from the time of the prophets through Savonarola and Luther until today, for outrage, anger and calls for moral renewal. This social adrenalin has both destructive and creative effects: we rarely know which will be uppermost until later. Yet the need for figures like St\u00e9phane Hessel, who died this week, and Beppe Grillo, very much still with us, can hardly be denied. Hessel, whose pamphlet Indignez-Vous! shot round the world in dozens of translations, was an inspiration for Grillo's followers, and for the Spanish indignados and the Occupy Wall Street protesters in the United States. Outrage is different from revolution, rebellion and restoration, although it has some connections to all three. It can be simplistic, fraudulent or just misplaced, but without it there would never be any new beginnings in human life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
