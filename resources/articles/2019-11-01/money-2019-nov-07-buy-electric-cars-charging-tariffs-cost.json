I\u2019ve identified a model that I\u2019d like, but I\u2019m puzzled by the infrastructure I\u2019ll need. As far as I can tell, it\u2019d be cheapest to charge the car overnight, using a suitable tariff like Economy 7. But I\u2019m reluctant to commit to installing a charger until I\u2019ve worked out what to do next. Should I check with my energy supplier first to see if it has a suitable tariff, or go ahead and get the charger installed in the hope that I can find a suitable tariff afterwards. Or should I just buy the car and sort out charging issues later? SP, London Your caution is understandable since electric cars, while promoted by the government for their green credentials, made up only 1.1% of car sales this year and, although cheaper to run, they cost more than the average traditional car to buy. For pioneers like you, there\u2019s the issue of rapidly evolving battery and charging technologies and the dearth of public charging points. According to David Lewis, founder of the advice website electriccarhome, the cost of charging depends on where, when and how often, you charge. Charging at home overnight on an off-peak tariff would cost 5p per kWh rising to 30p at a motorway service station. At work, or at a hotel, it could be free if you have an obliging employer or all-in deal. A number of energy companies offer cheap night-time rates for electric car owners, depending on where you live. Find the provider first, preferably an eco-friendly one since that\u2019s the whole point, and get a free smart meter installed before you bring the car home. If you have off-street parking, it\u2019s safer and faster to get a dedicated charging point installed and you get a \u00a3500 government grant towards the cost. Lewis advises asking your electricity supplier to confirm that the type of charging point you have in mind is \u201csmart\u201d enough to charge automatically during the off-peak charging window. Once you\u2019re up and running that 5p off-peak tariff could buy you 10,000 miles for around \u00a3132 a year.
