Charles Kennedy's fear that it lacked principle will have found an echo in many an activist's heart. David Steel's appeal to heads over hearts was a necessary corrective, and this view prevailed in Birmingham last night. But Mr Clegg should remember that his party is a coalition too, one that has many more members who are intuitively sympathetic to Labour than to the Conservatives \u2013 just like the majority of Liberal Democrat voters. Scottish Lib Dems such as Mr Kennedy have every reason to be anxious about a deal that could cost them dear in the elections for the Holyrood parliament in a year's time. Scottish Labour has already unrolled the welcome mat with a web page devoted to recruiting the disenchanted. Mr Kennedy is also right to point to the unfavourable pattern of coalitions in the 20th century, which have twice severely damaged the Liberal cause. Not that they are uniformly disastrous \u2013 look at Labour's transformation in the wartime coalition \u2013 but Mr Clegg should beware. Meanwhile activists must watch the small print of government like a hawk, as the skeleton deal agreed last week is filled out, to ensure that the final coalition agreement does not dictate their party's future. There is common ground in the civil liberties agenda and a shared critique of the failings of central government, but beneath the umbrella of the national interest much more divides Lib Dems and Conservatives than unites them. That was the message activists delivered to their leadership yesterday. Liberals in cabinet for the first time in 70 years was a fine thing, but not at the expense of the party's core objectives: social justice, an end to tuition fees, the protection of the Human Rights Act and, above all, the ultimate aim of proportional representation. Few people voted Lib Dem so that they could provide ballast for centrist Cameroons against their more swivel-eyed backbenchers. Disenchanted activists may find a renewed Labour party with a young, energetic leader more appealing than a party that allowed its principles to be diluted in order to experience power. Above all, it must not sell the pass on electoral reform. The referendum on AV offers the Lib Dems nothing. But at the same time, making the coalition work could be a valuable argument in the campaign for proportionality. Otherwise, the possibility remains that the attempt to break the mould culminates in exactly the opposite outcome: the vice of the two-party system re-established, with the Lib Dems back in their traditional position \u2013 squashed in the middle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
