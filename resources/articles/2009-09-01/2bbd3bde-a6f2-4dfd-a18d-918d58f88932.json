I've known about Leonard Cheshire for a long time. I grew up in 1970s Lancashire and Group Captain Leonard Cheshire was a bit of a folk hero in that part of the world. The attraction of the organisation was deeply embedded, but, in addition to that nostalgic view, there have been several things about the charity that have really impressed me, particularly the extension of its work into finding the best possible opportunities for disabled people. With God's help, I've been very successful in business, but the heart that beats deepest is a charitable heart. What leadership qualities do you bring to this role? There are two or three things I think I bring. One is energy: we live in an intensely competitive world and for the Leonard Cheshire group to fulfil its ambitions and continue to grow, it needs that injection of energy. I also bring a late 20th-century perspective. All such organisations get to a point where there has to be a changeover in leadership from those who have taken it to where it has got to. I'm 47 and my peer group is now taking up responsibility and leadership in business, politics and finance, so I'm networked into that. I have a very international perspective. Hong Kong was home until recently, but I'm often in New York and have friends in senior positions in Shanghai and India. As chair of Leonard Cheshire, I will be aiming to build up the organisation for the next 25 years. I want money from hedge fund enterprises, from Indian and Chinese enterprises. What's your leadership style? My style is extrovert and transparent. I'm very direct in conversations and communications. What makes you cross? I rarely lose my temper. But petty people politics makes me cross. How do you deal with people when you are angry? I make sure the organisation or person gets it: I don't go off in a huff. I explain things clearly, and address issues quickly and directly. What made you return to the UK, after two decades in Hong Kong? The pull of raising a family here. I'm from Lancashire; I think we owe it to the younger Muslim kids not to lose a new generation. What are your personal passions? Anything to do with Lancashire, including Freddie Flintoff! I own Accrington Stanley football club. lcdisability.org"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
