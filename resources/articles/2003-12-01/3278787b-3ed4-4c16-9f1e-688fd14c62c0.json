The drink giant's deal will allow it two mentions on Radio 1's Sunday night Top 40 show and a further name check in the credits of the recently revamped TV programme. Rivals have accused the BBC of cynically accepting advertising through the back door and Coca-Cola is certain to face accusations of hypocrisy after recent declarations that it would stop advertising to the under-12s. The fizzy drinks manufacturer and other snack and fast-food giants are facing growing criticism from health campaigners concerned about the rise in childhood obesity. MPs have called for tobacco-style health warnings on food labels. The BBC, which operates a strict ban on sponsorship, was today accused of \"commercial creep\" in agreeing to broadcast Coca Cola's name on Radio 1's singles chart, the Radio 2 album chart and Top of the Pops. Coca-Cola's deal is not with the BBC but with the Official UK Charts Company but critics say it would not have sealed the deal were it not to gain exposure on the programmes, which attract millions of young viewers and listeners. \"It's par for the course,\" said Phil Riley, the chief executive of Chrysalis Radio, whose stations broadcast the rival Hit 40 UK chart. \"The BBC has been acting in a commercial manner in all sorts of areas for dozens of years. It's like commercial creep. Everything it gets away with emboldens it to do the next thing.\" He said the BBC appeared to be receiving a \"financial benefit\" from the deal, in which Coca-Cola is paying the Official UK Charts Company for a two-year tie-up starting in January. \"One assumes the cost to the BBC of the chart is in some way lessened by the chart being sponsored by Coca-Cola. The BBC is paying less - in effect a financial benefit is being received by the BBC from Coca-Cola,\" Mr Riley said. \"What the BBC is doing with Coca-Cola is exactly how commercial radio entered sponsorship market in the mid-80s with co-funded programming. \"If they can't afford to enter into a straightforward arrangement for a chart provider without it requiring subsidy, it's nonsensical.\" Mark Story, the managing director of Emap's radio programming, warned the indirect sponsorship could be construed as commercial activity and might damage the BBC's efforts to have its royal charter renewed in 2006. \"If the BBC is subject to commercial mentions, it's hard to see what the point of the BBC is,\" Mr Story said. \"They may well find that, if they get into that situation, it may go against them in terms of what they want to be supported by the licence fee. \"Radio 1 does contribute money towards paying for the chart. This is still making a commercial endorsement on the BBC. It's a decision they may bitterly regret later on. \"As the BBC moves towards to charter renewal they don't need the waters to be muddied. \"Radio 1 is going to be embarrassing to the BBC by putting it in the position where it's hard for them to take the moral high ground and extol the virtues of the BBC when they have a messy commercial deal. \"I think it's something regrettable and it won't do the BBC any good.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
