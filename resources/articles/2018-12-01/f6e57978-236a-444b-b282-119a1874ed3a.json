Tottenham\u2019s players and supporters will scan the fixture list and, first and foremost, circle the derby against Arsenal. It is doubtful whether it will ever change, because no opponent can stir the same depth of feeling as the old enemy. But these days, there is a bigger picture at play and Spurs folk have other highlighting to do, taking in top-four Premier League duels and decisive Champions League dates. The last week or so has seen the domestic visit of Chelsea and a European one from Internazionale. Sunday\u2019s showdown at the Emirates Stadium has lurked in the background \u2013 at least until now. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big game but so was Inter on Wednesday and so was Chelsea last Saturday,\u201d Toby Alderweireld says. \u201cThat says something about the evolution of Spurs. The derby is not the biggest game of the year, although it\u2019s a very big game and we know this. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to get three points.\u201d The balance of north-London power is a perennial discussion and Spurs can point to having finished above Arsenal in each of the last two seasons, having been below them for the previous 22. Top team in the capital last time out, they are currently three points better off than Arsenal. Yet when Alderweireld charts Tottenham\u2019s progress, both over the course of this season and, more generally, since Mauricio Pochettino took charge in 2014, the defender prefers to focus on internal markers. Chief among them is the mentality \u2013 which is Pochettino\u2019s obsession. Spurs have won six in a row in all competitions, with the 3-1 victory against Chelsea the most impressive. The 1-0 win against Inter was eye-catching in a different way, a triumph of patience and resilience, and it has all suggested that after a season of problems \u2013 some off the field, linked to the delayed new stadium \u2013 the team have rediscovered their best form. Alderweireld disagrees, partly because he can never be satisfied. It is a mindset he believes must permeate the dressing room. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel we are hitting our best,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are the most critical persons of our own performance. A lot has been said about the stadium and the pitch at Wembley, and I think we\u2019re doing very well but we can improve. And even if we go well, we can improve further.\u201d Alderweireld does accept the Chelsea and Inter victories have \u201cshowed we can compete with anybody\u201d. The team are \u201cmaking steps\u201d and the biggest one, he says, has been the return of attacking cohesion, particularly against Chelsea. \u201cWe\u2019re playing good football now and before was maybe different,\u201d Alderweireld says. \u201cFootball can ask for other things, like strength and digging out results. That\u2019s football as well. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult. Sometimes, in the past, we\u2019d play well but if we didn\u2019t play well, we didn\u2019t get the results. Now, if we don\u2019t play well, we\u2019re still defending very well. That\u2019s important. \u201cWembley and the pitch is not good \u2013 we know that \u2013 but we don\u2019t try to use it as an excuse and we\u2019re going well. Defensively, we\u2019re getting better, and also in terms of attacking football, as we saw against Inter. We play well as a team, defending and attacking as a team. Our goal against Inter started from the back. And if we defend, we start with Harry Kane up front.\u201d Alderweireld\u2019s personal evolution has been an interesting sideshow. The 29-year-old endured a nightmarish second half to last season, when a hamstring injury set him back. He struggled to regain his place and it felt as though his prospects were harmed by the impasse in negotiations over a contract. Mindful that he could leave for a knockdown \u00a325m at the end of this season, the club were open to offers in the summer. Manchester United were heavily linked but there was no movement and Alderweireld has bounced back. After a successful World Cup with Belgium, he has started 12 of Tottenham\u2019s 13 league games and four of five in the Champions League. Not many players have fallen from favour under Pochettino only to return on a regular basis but it would be a surprise if Alderweireld did not sit tight to test his release clause and a bigger one if a rival club did not meet it. Will he still be at Spurs next season? Is it now or never for him in terms of winning something at the club? Tottenham remain within striking distance of the leaders, Manchester City, but nobody seems to consider them title contenders, mainly because of City\u2019s form. That might change if they produce a statement victory at Arsenal to set alongside their dismissal of Chelsea. Alderweireld, however, is preoccupied simply by pushing his limits and those of his teammates. \u201cWe\u2019re not bothered about what people think,\u201d Alderweireld says. \u201cWe just like to stick to our own performances and try to improve. Even if we have bad results, we\u2019re doing the same things, because we know that\u2019s the way to win. There are good fundamentals and we go to Arsenal to win. They are pretty different under Unai Emery \u2013 good attacking and defensively more sorted than before. We have to be on top form to beat them but we\u2019re confident.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
