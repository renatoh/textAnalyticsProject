Despite Labour's recent strong showing in the polls, the extent of the prime minister's gamble in calling a late October or early November poll was underlined by the news that the financial turmoil of the past two months - culminating in the Bank of England lifeline to Northern Rock - has left the public markedly more concerned about the health of the economy. The monthly snapshot of consumer confidence from the research group Gfk found that consumer confidence weakened in September and grew worse after the Northern Rock crisis. Although voters were far gloomier about the state of the economy overall than they were about their personal finances. The findings of the survey are likely to intensify the debate inside the Labour party over the desirability of calling an election in early November, with some saying that turbulent financial markets make a campaign risky and others saying that the government should go to the country before a deteriorating economy erodes the impact of the \"Brown bounce\", which has given Labour an average poll lead of six points over the Conservatives. Richard McGuire, strategist with RBC Capital Markets, said: \"Clearly the market turmoil has had a negative effect upon consumer sentiment although it remains to be seen whether the post Northern Rock dip is a knee jerk reaction to the extraordinary images of a run on that particular bank or a more lasting decline in optimism.\" Gfk said consumer confidence fell from -4 in August to -7 in September, but conducted two rounds of interviews, before and after the three days of queues outside Northern Rock branches. After the crisis, confidence stood at -9, the lowest level since December 2005. \"Confidence might rebound once Northern Rock leaves the headlines,\" said Vicky Redwood, analyst with Capital Economics. \"Nontheless, consumer spending is likely to come under enough pressure in the coming months from higher interest rates and a slower housing market.\" Other evidence yesterday suggested that the economy - which grew strongly at an annual rate of 3% in the first half of 2007 - is likely to slow over the coming months. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve and now a part-time adviser to Mr Brown, said that the danger of recession had risen as a result of the turmoil in the global financial markets. While putting the risk of a downturn in the US or any other country at less than 50-50, Mr Greenspan said he was \"less optimistic than one would like\". Further pressure on household incomes is likely to come from rising energy prices over the coming months. The cost of Brent crude oil hit a record level of just over $81 a barrel in London, while prices in New York rose above $83 a barrel. On the foreign exchanges, speculation that the threat of a US recession would force the Federal Reserve into further cuts in interest rates led to a fresh bout of dollar selling. Ray Holloway, of the Petrol Retailers Association, said the increasing cost of crude would not affect the price of petrol or diesel but warned that the deferred increase in excise duty announced in the March budget and due to come into force on Monday, would add 2.35p to pump prices. Former French finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn was confirmed yesterday as the International Monetary Fund's new leader, continuing a six-decade tradition in which a European leads the world body. The decision by the IMF's 24-member board was taken in two stages, which included a secret straw poll followed by a formal vote. Mr Strauss-Kahn will begin his five-year term on November 1 and succeeds Rodrigo Rato, who will step down in mid-October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
