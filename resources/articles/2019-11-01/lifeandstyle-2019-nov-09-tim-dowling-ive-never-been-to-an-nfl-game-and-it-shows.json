It was my first international football match, and I had to endure the discomfort of having to have everything explained to me by an 11-year-old, in an atmosphere of extreme menace. Below us, a Ukrainian player with long blond hair was fouled and lay on the pitch bleeding, to the fury of everyone around us. \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d I said to the middle one. \u201cVoronin,\u201d he said. \u201cHe plays for Liverpool but he\u2019s on loan to Hertha.\u201d \u201cGet up, My Little Fucking Pony!\u201d shouted the man behind us. Ten years later I am on the train to Wembley, again with my middle son. I\u2019m taking him to see an American football game, and I am enduring the mild humiliation of having the sport of my people explained to me by an English-born 21-year-old who knows way more about the NFL than I ever did. He is running me through the starting line-ups of the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Houston Texans, two teams that didn\u2019t even exist when I still lived in the States. \u201cLast time I checked, Houston were called the Oilers,\u201d I say. \u201cThe Oilers moved to Nashville to become the Titans,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Jaguars\u2019 quarterback is like a sixth round draft pick, but he took over when their starter got injured.\u201d \u201cOK,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s called Gardner Minshew,\u201d he says. \u201cMinshew?\u201d I say. \u201cAre you making this up?\u201d \u201cDo you see these people wearing headbands and fake moustaches?\u201d he says, pointing down the carriage. \u201cThey\u2019re all dressed up as him.\u201d It\u2019s true: the train is dotted with people in fake moustaches and headbands, some of them women. \u201cMinshew,\u201d I say, quietly. We walk to the stadium in a sharpening drizzle. As we take our seats, the middle one explains that because the Jaguars are the designated home team for UK matches, and also due to persistent rumours that they might one day become the first London NFL franchise, the team enjoys considerable support in Britain. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to change the way they pronounce Jaguar,\u201d I say. I will later recall this as the least stupid thing uttered by me all afternoon, although that will be of little comfort. The middle one appears to have decided that we are Jacksonville fans for the day. I feel a bit weird about this, partly because I don\u2019t care and partly because the people right behind me are Houston fans who have travelled all the way from Texas for this game. But the seating is mixed: home and away fans, Americans and British, sober and very, very drunk, all sharing an infectious, demented enthusiasm. I think about how long it\u2019s been since I last attended an NFL game. Then I realise: I have never been to an NFL game. During the second half, the middle one begins to address his comments in part to the people behind us, twisting in his seat in search of an audience who might at least know what he\u2019s talking about. On the field, a long pass is ruled incomplete after it slips from a receiver\u2019s grasp, but the call is under review. \u201cI really thought he had that!\u201d the middle one shouts, craning his neck round. \u201cHe hung on to it for a good minute!\u201d shouts the man from Texas, leaning forward. I turn. \u201cWhat does he have to do, take it home with him?\u201d I say. The man and his wife stare at me in polite bewilderment. I spend the next few minutes trying to figure out why it was the wrong thing to say. \u201cMinshew,\u201d I mumble. By the fourth quarter, Houston have built up a commanding lead, and my fair-weather fandom has hit a bank of cloud. The English Jaguar fans leave early, one man high-fiving our entire row as he files past. A few seconds shy of the two-minute warning, the middle one signals that we, too, have seen enough, and we stand. \u201cGood luck with the rest of it!\u201d I say to the people behind us, which, in the context of what has gone before, makes no sense at all. I think about this as we make our way down the road, surrounded by people in headbands and fake moustaches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
