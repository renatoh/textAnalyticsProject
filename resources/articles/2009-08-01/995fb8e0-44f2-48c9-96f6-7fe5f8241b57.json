More interesting, though, is the way in which the community's knowledge is shared and expanded over a weekend. It's a beautiful thing. Almost as beautiful, in fact, as watching Sonofwebcore and LosttheLot having little digs at each other (I jest). As was observed in the middle of last week's record-breaking thread, there were far too many good songs recommended this week to make the first 10, or indeed 20, anything other than subjective (I'm not sure that it's ever possible to make it truly objective, or definitive, but I'm sure it's possible to get closer towards such a goal). Suffice to say that David Axelrod's Messiah, Kate Bush's Sexual Healing, the Clash's Justice Tonight, Cowboy Junkies' Sweet Jane, anything by Otis Redding, the White Stripes' Black Jack Davey, Lily Allen's Straight to Hell, Against All Odds by the Postal Service, Kraftwerk covers, the Futureheads' Hounds of Love, Aretha's Bridge over Troubled Water, Ella's Sunshine of Your Love, Ben Folds's Bitches Ain't Shit would have made a whacking, cracking (oversized) C-list. Here, however, is the list I have declared to be B: Jeff Buckley \u2013 Corpus Christi Carol It's an unlikely pairing of material and artist, but such is the strength of the vocal it seems as if the melody was crafted specifically for Buckley. Certainly, I prefer it to the slightly discomforting Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan cover. Tricky \u2013 Black Steel The infrequency of hip-hop covers was discussed, by Steenbeck among others, and this is perhaps the foremost in that shortlist (I also like the Pharaoh Monche PE cover). The change in tempo, the increase in tension, it feels like an escape from a penal colony on Mars. Tiga \u2013 Hot in Herre The usually hyper-sexualised DJ Tiga strips Nelly's, er, stripclub anthem of all its thrills, making it sound like the work of a jaded roue. Not so jaded that he forgets to add a banging beat. Cradle of Filth \u2013 Temptation Silly and slightly histrionic, but with lyrics like \"Adorable creatures / With unacceptable features\" this synth-pop original seems to have found its natural home as a piece of gore metal. Shinehead \u2013 Billie Jean All it does is skank, but it's lovely all the same. Hot 8 Brass Band \u2013 Sexual Healing Can a brass band sound sexy? Hmm, I'm still not sure, but it can sound joyous and ebullient. Which is what it does here. Limp Bizkit \u2013 Faith I suspect this might be another Abergevanny moment, but I think this is ace. When the chorus comes in, I almost want to take up skateboarding. Davy Graham \u2013 Better Get It In Your Soul Speedy fingerpicking replaces Mingus's full, swinging band, and the melody is left to stand on its own two feet and do a little jig. (This one's for you Shiv ...) Jose Gonzalez \u2013 Heartbeats Slightly spoiled by being the sound of Sony for a while, it's still an aching, wistful version that's as distinct from the Knife's original as one could imagine possible. Massive Attack \u2013 Light My Fire Dubby cover versions were quite common recommendations and so were covers of this song. I've plumped for the Bristolians, as much as anything else, because of that moment the beat comes in. OK. That's the world's biggest topic in the universe ever dealt with. This week's will be more restrictive. Sleep and insomnia have already been covered (in the same topic! That Dorian had it easy. Check the rr index for the full list), so this is about fatigue. Really I'm talking about lyrical content, but those who can argue their case might get a tired musical mood in too. The more tired the song, the more points you get. FYI \u2013 I appreciate the sourcing of links to go with a recommendation, but it's not essential. What is definitely encouraged though is justification of your choice. Posts which simply dump 30 track names aren't that helpful, and for two reasons: I can't get in your head and then fall back more on my own opinion; it doesn't generate debate with fellow recommenders. So let's redouble our efforts in that direction. Toolbox: The full archive and A-List (sorry about last week folks); index, spill, collabo playlist.
