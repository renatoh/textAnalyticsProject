Did it matter? Not in the slightest. The defence thrived forcing more turnovers than points allowed and shutting Jacksonville down. Quarterback Deshaun Watson the beneficiary throwing for 201yd and two touchdowns in their crushing win over the Jaguars at Wembley. Watson\u2019s play made him look more matador than gunslinger and showed up rookie Gardner Minshew who threw two interceptions as Jacksonville, who coughed up another two fumbles, were forced into throwing the ball while Leonard Fournette was restricted to 40 yards. The AFC South now looks pretty for Houston who enter their week off with six wins and three losses and hold the tie-breaker over Jacksonville after beating them home and away. Four wins and five defeats for the Jaguars means their play-off chances, conversely, look bleak. Houston head coach, Bill O\u2019Brien, was pleased with how his defence and quarterback controlled Jacksonville, \u201cThey did a great job. They played disciplined and did their jobs efficiently,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThe pass rush was good and everyone was disciplined in their gap control relative to the run game. \u201cThe quarterback is the coordinator. He makes the decisions. Deshaun is playing at a really good level right now. He is making good decisions and managing the game.\u201d Watson made sure his team finished with three points on the opening drive after Ka\u2019imi Fairbarn\u2019s 52-yard field goal. The crucial play coming on first and 34 as Watson danced around a defender and hauled the ball to Duke Johnson for 21 yards. The Watson show continued with an expertly navigated eight-minute 80-yard touchdown drive. Watson\u2019s next trick was somehow handing the ball off to Carlos Hyde with a defender clamped around his waist to take the Texans into the redzone. A pass to tight end Darren Fells sealed 9-0 but the extra point was blocked by Cody Davis. Minshew took over but had to settle for his side\u2019s 63-yard march ending with a Josh Lambo field goal. A 31-yard pass to Ryquell Armstead converting a third-down to avoid a third successive punt. Minshew\u2019s evasive action made sure the play stayed alive and Jacksonville had something at half-time. Minshew resumed and moved his side downfield but the Jaguars eschewed their quarterback\u2019s good work. A botched fake field goal kept the score at 9-3 and crucially leaving the game squarely on Minshew\u2019s inexperienced shoulders. What should have been a three-point deficit was now a mountain after the Texans converted the favourable field position for three. Jaguars head coach, Doug Marrone, was downbeat when asked about the decision, \u201cIt was disappointing. Josh didn\u2019t feel he was going to be able to kick it. We missed that opportunity.\u201d Jacksonville handed it straight back. Hyde - who had a monster day with 160 yards rushing from 19 carries - sidestepped into clean air for a 48-yard burst. Watson hit DeAndre Hopkins who bulldozed forward arriving at the goal line and Johnson punched it in for Houston\u2019s second touchdown. Defenders swarmed all over Jacksonville\u2019s receivers knowing time was ticking away and passes were inbound. Four successive pass attempts led to four failures and a turnover on downs from Minshew. Houston continued to upset him as Jahleel Addae intercepted a deep pass. Minshew stepped up again and another interception was costly, Justin Reid grabbing the errant throw and galloping to three yards out. Watson found Hopkins in the endzone to seal it with four minutes left. Teams often struggle on their first trip to London but the Texans embarrassed the Jaguars in their seventh appearance at Wembley and poured cold water on \u2018Minshew Mania\u2019. The quarterback heads back to Florida battered, bruised and looking over his shoulder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
