Dual Olympian Brenton Rickard, who won bronze with the 4x100m medley team in 2012, revealed on Friday a sample he provided in London had been re-tested and found to have contained a small amount of a masking agent, furosemide. The result means Rickard and each of his medley teammates \u2013 James Magnussen, Christian Sprenger, Hayden Stoeckel, Matt Targett and Tommaso D\u2019Orsogna \u2013 stand to lose their medals. Australia prides itself on an untarnished doping record at the Olympics and has never before been stripped of medals. In an email to teammates, obtained and published by the Sydney Morning Herald, a \u201cdevastated\u201d Rickard denied having ever taken performance-enhancing drugs and said the situation was his \u201cworst nightmare\u201d. The concentration of furosemide found in his sample was \u201cexceedingly small\u201d, he said, and the re-analysis did not detect any other prohibited substance. Nevertheless, the International Olympic Committee has filed proceedings to the court of arbitration for sport and will seek to void all Rickard\u2019s results from the 2012 Games. As well as competing in the 4x100m medley, he reached the finals of the 100m and 200m breaststroke events, finishing sixth and seventh respectively. Rickard, now 37, has engaged lawyers to fight the disqualification, which he said was \u201cgrossly unfair and disproportionate\u201d, not least because he did not swim in the final \u2013 his involvement in the heats was enough to earn himself a medal. \u201cAs you know I would never, ever knowingly or deliberately take a banned substance without a TUE [therapeutic use exemption],\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is not acceptable within my own personal values, nor ever acceptable within the culture of our team. \u201cI have always abhorred doping within the sport so you can imagine how sickened and horrified I am to find myself in this predicament. This is my worst nightmare.\u201d The case will be heard at the Cas in Switzerland on 9 November. When contacted by Guardian Australia, the Australian Olympic Committee said it would not comment as there was a process in place. Swimming Australia has also been contacted for comment. Rickard, who was the Australian Institute of Sport\u2019s athlete of the year in 2009 and is a former president of the Australian Swimmers Association, also won a slew of medals at world championships in 2007 and 2009 and has held national, Commonwealth and Oceanic records. Australia has long prided itself on its clean doping record. Current star Mack Horton was widely praised for taking a public stand against China\u2019s Sun Yang at last year\u2019s world championships. Sun was eventually banned for eight years in February after being accused of ordering a member of his entourage to smash vials containing his blood. But during the same championships where Horton was staging his protest, it was revealed his teammate, Shayna Jack, had returned a positive test for the banned substance ligandrol. She is currently appealing a four-year Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority ban which threatens to end her career."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
