Man the barricades behind the BMWs, Mercs and Porsches. Gird up your designer clothes and rattle your credit cards. Entertainment workers of the world unite: you have nothing to lose but your audience. Enough, enough. It is all too preposterous. 'Actors' strike threatens chaos' read the BBC news headline on Ceefax this Tuesday, which in the most sombre of times provoked the first genuine giggle of the week. And as for the Professional Footballers' Association making gruff noises about balloting its members on whether to take industrial action - forget it. Everybody knows that during the past decade our slick and suited lads, all the way from Torquay to Tynecastle, have filled their flimsy little bootees with wads of cash. Go on strike because their employers won't cough up a little extra for their union? Don't think so. Or work strictly to rule? Most wouldn't last 90 minutes. Let us be clear what we are talking about here, for all of a sudden those pervasive pongs of wintergreen and ultra-expensive aftershave in the corridors of football have been replaced with the pungent rhetoric of a good old pre-Thatcherite industrial punch-up. \"It's an insult,\" fumed Gordon Taylor, the PFA's chairman, after it was offered a slightly smaller slice of the TV cake. \"If the players decide to go down the route now apparently being suggested, as far as I'm concerned they would be in breach of contract and would not be paid,\" retorted the Leeds United chairman Peter Ridsdale. Millionaire football players v millionaire chairmen. Wallets at 10 paces. This is an Alice in Wonderland situation anyway, with the PFA beholden to the Premiership and the Football League for the vast majority of its revenue via television rights. And within the TUC, to which the PFA is affiliated, this is unique: an employer paying the employees to keep their union financially viable. At least - like the second-to-last Dodo left on Mauritius - almost unique. Witness Rupert Murdoch, owner of the Times, the Sun and many other fine newspapers throughout the world, who pays for his employees to become members of the News International Staff Association in order to stop journalists and other workers joining a proper trades union. No, no - the relationship between football's ruling bodies and the PFA is nothing like that. Symbiosis is the word. Sort of. Put it this way: the PFA is seen as a kind of stakeholder in the whole of the football world. It is getting a cut of all the money flowing into football to fund its many and varied operations and this is altogether different from an employee being bought off by an employer. Well it must be, mustn't it? You see, the football world must not be confused with the real world, or why would we punters shell out our hard-earned cash through the turnstiles knowing full well, because the clubs tell us so, that they cannot exist on our paltry offerings at all, and rely almost entirely on the television subsidy? We may argue until we are red, blue or black and white striped in the face that some of this TV money should be passed on to us to keep the cost of watching football down. No chance. Yet if this is the case, then why should the PFA expect to secure ever-increasing amounts of the TV money to place it in the pockets of those who already pocket the most, the players? The fact is that this is not a simple trade dispute. It is not the National Coal Board versus the NUM, and for the Football League, the Premiership chairman or the PFA to suggest otherwise is plain silly. Obviously not every club possesses the finances of Manchester United, nor every player the personal wealth of David Beckham. An awful lot of professional footballers still retire with little in the way of assets and even less in the way of skills (and don't laugh). The PFA does much to educate and support its less well-off members as well as working diligently to combat racism in football. From the TUC point of view the PFA is not like other unions, but it clearly has an eye towards social justice and progressive issues. But to threaten industrial action on this issue is patently absurd, and a strike is out of the question. Taylor must surely realise that. A compromise will doubtless be reached, but it remains an uncomfortable thought just how much virtually all of the domestic football structure is so utterly dependent on the shifting television shilling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
