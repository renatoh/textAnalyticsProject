Remember Vic and Bob struggling to control a corpsing fit because Matt Lucas was standing in the middle of the studio shouting \u201cPeanuts\u201d? Or Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson catching each other\u2019s eye and crumpling, mid-frying pan fight, during a Bottom live show? I always adored Jennifer Saunders pursing her lips and suppressing a snort when her comedy partner Dawn French did a new bit of business she hadn\u2019t done in rehearsals. A new BBC Three sketch show \u2013 the only channel that appears to still be making sketch shows; have you bathed in the wonder of Famalam? Please do \u2013 manages to capture a delightful portion of that ticklish glee. Ellie and Natasia is the creation of Ellie White and Natasia Demetriou. You may recognise them from sterling work in other people\u2019s shows: White did a brilliant turn as a conniving waitress in Inside No 9 episode The Bill and Demetriou is currently making a splash as a sassy vampire in Taika Waititi\u2019s What We Do in the Shadows. Their sketches rifle through the drawers of modern life, but the two save their pointiest sticks for how women feel they need to behave to be acceptable in \u2013 I\u2019m going to have to say it \u2013 this western patriarchy of ours. The pair\u2019s Mum\u2019s the Word vloggers are two women of indeterminate age who do lifestyle demonstrations for other mums while wearing padded gilets and rubber gloves. Their mission is to be \u201cas small and as clean as possible\u201d because a \u201cgood mum\u201d is one who throws out raw chicken once it has been out of the fridge for more than 20 minutes, and puts each piece of rubbish in a separate bin bag, \u201cuuh koy\u201d? And they remind us to invite other mums around at least once a day for a \u201cgirls\u2019 night\u201d that involves said chicken \u201cstuffed with a little bit of chee\u201d (cheese) and (props to the props department) a tray of champagne flutes inexplicably garnished with a piece of lettuce and a prawn. They are not just taking deliberate pot-shots from a grassy knoll \u2013 it\u2019s way more fun than that; the gag shrapnel sprays indiscriminately. Internet Nails sees them playing a version of the Sexy American Girls, a European double-act they performed in the equally brilliant BBC Three pilot People Time. White does a very good line in \u201chostage face\u201d as Demetriou pouts and grimaces at the camera, trying to promote their new beauty business, based in an \u201cexecutive kitchen\u201d somewhere off London\u2019s North Circular road. They play around with silly accents and unexpected word combinations like two kids freestyling in a big Lego box. It is immense fun watching as their brains will jump in every direction. Playing themselves in a bathroom scene, the pair discuss life and love and how they want to be remembered when they\u2019re dead. Demetriou says she\u2019s going to find love by making herself look like a sexy baby, because that\u2019s what men want really want: a small, hairless creature who will be sexually attractive and helpless at the same time. The closing musical number takes the idea to its conclusion with a comely R&amp;B parody video in which they twerk around a set of giant alphabet blocks in tutus, tight tops and big nappies singing about how they want Daddy to change their nappy \u201cwhen I brown myself\u201d. It directs a flame-thrower blast to the accepted idea of beauty in a way that is both uncomfortable and brilliantly to the point. There is a strong seam of feminist fury running through some of White and Demetriou\u2019s gags. I don\u2019t think they are positioning themselves as deliberately political, but the anger is there, barely a millimetre beneath the surface. I found it thrilling. So far, all we have is one 18-minute episode that I have already watched several times. Could we have more please? I am worried that the broadcasters won\u2019t bag White and Demetriou quickly enough and they will be off to more glistening pastures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
