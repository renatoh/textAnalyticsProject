The BBC news correspondent today defended herself against the allegations, made yesterday, that she compromised the prime minister 's security by speaking about his travel plans during BBC1's Breakfast programme. She also criticised Tom Kelly, the press officer who highlighted the gaffe at a briefing yesterday. \"Even though the BBC clarified and dealt with the problem, the Downing Street spokesman declined to withdraw the personal allegation, which has now been widely reported in the press,\" Adie said. \"His appropriate response perhaps should have been to have approached the BBC immediately after the transmission of the first report of the prime minister's movements. He should have clarified matters via the appropriate channels rather than briefed the press several hours later.\" Sambrook revealed further details of Mr Blair's travel plans on Radio 4's Today programme this morning. The BBC news director was defending Adie when he identified the British embassies of two countries, breaking an embargo on one of them. He also said Adie was \"the last person who should take the blame\" for yesterday's Breakfast blunder. \"There was a problem in the team, some members of which should have been aware that they couldn't say that,\" Sambrook said. \"We've looked into that, tried to tighten things up to make sure it doesn't happen again and apologised to Downing Street.\" But the BBC believes it has been unfairly criticised for Sambrook's accidental revelations about Blair's itinerary, details of which have appeared on several foreign news wires. Adie said she \"repudiated\" the allegation that she had endangered the prime minister's security. \"I responded neutrally to a question, which already contained the information,\" she explained. \"I did not discuss, at any time, the specific travel arrangements or plans for the prime minister.\" Adie's solicitor, Mark Stephens, said she was discussing with him the possibility of suing Mr Kelly and the Sun, which on today's front page called for her to be sacked."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
