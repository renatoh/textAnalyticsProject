It\u2019s been historic. Bye! It\u2019s over! Reece Burke, a Newham-born West Ham fan, has scored his first professional goal to take the Hammers into round four, where they will meet Bournemouth or Wigan, who replay tomorrow. At West Ham, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Stefan Payne\u2019s miss with half an hour of normal time remaining, apparently a wonderful chance. In other \u201cnews\u201d, a player who hasn\u2019t played for nearly three years isn\u2019t going to play again: Having made the fans wait for more than 200 minutes for a goal against Shrewsbury, West Ham at least served up a good \u2018un. A corner is half-cleared, sent back into the box and Burke, on the half-volley, slams it in! Ten minutes to play at West Ham, and still no goal. \u201cI\u2019ve grown accustomed to reading about VARdy making crucial contributions to Leicester results, but VAR is gonna take some getting used to,\u201d notes Peter Oh. Half time in extra time, and it is still West Ham 0-0 Shrewsbury. Shrewsbury have made a fourth substitution of the evening, bringing on Bolton in extra time \u2013 who has just made a goal-saving clearance to deny Lanzini. Reading will indeed play Sheffield Wednesday in round four! Here\u2019s a match report on Leicester\u2019s victory: This is the image that assisted the VAR decision. Blue lines, it turns our, are good. I took my screengrab a moment before Mahrez hit the ball, so the decision was even closer than this appears: The decision to award Leicester\u2019s VAR-assisted goal took 67 seconds. Or 1.24% of a standard 90-minute football match. Numbers can be very hard to read on stripes, though, hence the blank back. It\u2019s the identical number font and colour, though, that\u2019s really confusing. Paul McInnes is at West Ham for us tonight, and has the unfortunate task of filing an interim match report for the early editions. It starts thus: West Ham United were taken to extra time at the London Stadium by Shrewsbury as their third round tie went into a fourth hour without a goal. Chances were few and far between on a cold East London night and Shrewsbury had the best of them on a rare breakaway. The addition of second half substitutes for West Ham upped the intensity somewhat, but not enough for a breakthrough. There will be extra time at the London Stadium, where West Ham still haven\u2019t found a way through the Shrewsbury defence. Three games are over, and these are the new-look FA Cup fourth-round ties: Cardiff v Manchester City Peterborough v Leicester Sheffield Wednesday v Reading (probably, barring a crazy late Stevenage fightback) This is certainly many times clearer: Here\u2019s a picture from the first half at Reading. I think from the front it\u2019s easy enough to tell the teams apart, but from the back it\u2019s another matter: \u201cVAR at its best\u201d seems a strange turn of phrase, given that us English are only just working out what it looks like. Still, we can consider its intervention tonight to have been emphatically positive. Cardiff\u2019s victory now has a cherry on the top, courtesy of Hoilett\u2019s 25-yarder: It looks like Manchester City won\u2019t be coming to Mansfield \u2013 but their manager is there already: Some other football-related news for you: Mention of Liverpool 4-4 Arsenal has got Jonny Mac reminiscing. \u201cI watched that game one afternoon while working for a major record label in New York,\u201d he writes. \u201cI had to get a website finished and launched for a very important artist by 5pm and had the game playing in a small screen on my monitor. Each time Liverpool scored I had to pretend that me punching the air was down to a fix that worked and every time Arshavin scored, my \u2018effin\u2019 \u2018ell!\u2019 outbursts owed to glitches that were delaying the launch. It all worked out. Happy days!\u201d There\u2019s been a hat-trick at Reading! But there won\u2019t be one at Leicester, where Iheanacho comes off, and Okazaki is on. Also on is Jamie Vardy, who replaces Mahrez to great acclaim from fans of both sides. For the first time ever in English football, a goal has been awarded as a result of VAR intervention. It was a close decision, but a correct one. Another Leicester goal is disallowed: Mahrez runs forward, engages all defenders and slips in Iheanacho to his right, who lifts the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper and into the net, but was offside. The VAR again has to check it, and on TV replays it looks extremely close. Anthony Pilkington scores a third for Cardiff, who look all set to book themselves a home date against Manchester City in round four! Was Pond fouling Iborra at a Leicester free-kick? The VAR is called upon, and can\u2019t see anything that should convince Jonathan Moss to point to the spot. \u201cWhile following the Sheffield Wednesday v the mighty Carlisle game from British Columbia, I am watching Liverpool v Arsenal on premier league classics,\u201d writes David Marriott. \u201cArshavin has scored a hat trick and Torres has just scored his second. Whatever happened to these lads? Great game \u2013 tell you what, this could end up 4-4.\u201d Well you\u2019ve seen more goals than anyone else tonight. For everyone else, here\u2019s a visual reminder: It\u2019s snowing goals in Sheffield, Atdhe Nuhiu doubling Wednesday\u2019s lead. I can\u2019t tell you much about the goal, except that it exists. And that David Hoilett scored it. Fleetwood bring on Devante Cole and Wes Burns, while McAlany and Hiwula-Mayifula come off. Now here\u2019s a thing \u2026 Leicester are rapping on the door, the scent of a second goal in their nostrils. Leicester have a goal disallowed \u2013 Mahrez passes to Gray, who pulls back to Iheanacho, who sidefoots in, but Mahrez\u2019s pass was overhit and the ball crossed the line before Gray reached it. A delay at Leicester, where Benalouane has just gone for a ball that Pond was diving to head clear, and the defender got a boot in the bonce for his troubles. Leicester have a fine chance for a second, Iheanacho this time feeding Slimani, whose volley from 15 yards bobbles wide. So only West Ham v Shrewsbury remains goalless. Fans there will already be getting excited about a potential bonus half-hour. Peeeep! Action is back under way in Leicester, and at all the other 7.45pm kick-offs. Jon Dadi Bodvarsson has his second goal of the night, and it sounds splendid: This is impressive. His shots-to-goal stats when he broke through at Manchester City were entirely ludicrous. The half-time whistle blows in Leicester, and though Fleetwood had their moments, the home side lead at the break. This was, according to the Stevenage Twitter feed, Reading\u2019s first shot on target. And it\u2019s gone in, from Jon Dadi Bodvarsson. \u201cClearly the Leicester players can\u2019t be arsed,\u201d sniffed Rai Skrupskis, a minute or two too soon. \u201cNeither can I, and I remember us losing three finals in the 60\u2019s and actually attended the 1969 one at old Wembley. It mattered a lot then. Not now. Sad!\u201d That is Leicester\u2019s first shot on target, and it\u2019s also their first goal. Slimani plays to Iheanacho, whose first touch brilliantly takes it out of his feet and sets him running, and he bears down on the goalkeeper before popping the ball between his legs! Now McAleny sends a near-post header wide. For all Leicester\u2019s possession, Fleetwood have come closer to actually scoring. Oooh! Dempsey\u2019s lovely shot from 22 yards is fizzing and dipping and probably on its way onto the bar, but Jakupovic tips it over! Benalouane fouls Hiwula-Mayifuila, a really late ankle-cruncher, and is deservedly booked. It\u2019s no longer raining in Sheffield, though \u2013 it\u2019s snowing. Cardiff don\u2019t lead for long, as Rose equalises from close range. Meanwhile in Leicester, Mahrez\u2019s shot from that free-kick goes just wide. They\u2019re really flying in now! Bruno Ecuele Manga puts Cardiff ahead at Mansfield. Mahrez is fouled a couple of yards from the edge of the area, and Leicester have a fine shooting chance. \u201cMeanwhile in Hammerland,\u201d writes Patrick van Ijzendoorn, \u201cthe main excitement in the London Stadium is the 4,000 Shrews fans singing \u2018Is this a library?\u2019\u201d Marco Matias has scored a goal! An actual goal! And then Fleetwood break, and McAleny carries the ball from the centre circle before sending a nice curling shot goalwards. Jakupovic has to dive to stop it, but the save isn\u2019t particularly difficult. Mahrez sends a terrible cross into the Fleetwood area, but the defender seems distracted and his clearance skews behind. The visitors clear the corner, though. A shot! McAleny has a pop for Fleetwood from the edge of the area, and it\u2019s firm and on target, but straight at Jakupovic. GOA \u2026 What\u2019s that? \u2026 Oh. Fleetwood just had a penalty appeal turned down, after Bell went over int he penalty area. VAR is in play here, but has not intervened. So far as I can tell, nothing of note has happened or is happening anywhere. So here\u2019s a picture of it raining in Sheffield: As the game has settled down Leicester have taken control, but have yet to turn their massive territorial dominance into clear chances. Amartey gets into space on the right, reaches the byline still in space, and crosses straight to the Fleetwood goalkeeper, Neal. Including stoppage time, tonight\u2019s 10 teams have between them now played over 500 minutes of FA Cup third-round football without scoring a goal. 5 mins: Fleetwood are giving as good as they\u2019re getting at Leicester, though the home side we a decent final pass from Iheanacho away from creating a good chance for Slimani a couple of minutes back. Peeeeeep! The 7.45pm kick-offs have kicked off! Elsewhere in the world of football: \u201cI see Geoff Eltringham is the referee at Mansfield today,\u201d writes JR. \u201cAbout two hours ago I watched the game from Saturday where he completely hosed Middlesbrough and was thinking I\u2019m not sure he should be refereeing any games. Then I found out he used to be a Sunderland season ticket holder so that at least explained his performance. Maybe he just shouldn\u2019t be allowed to ref any games involving Newcastle or Boro?\u201d I daresay he won\u2019t be let anywhere near Middlesbrough for a good while. Claude Puel talks to BT Sport: I think a cup game is always difficult. Of course the first leg was not a good game, but we played a strong team, powerful, quality. Now we need to be in the fourth round of the FA Cup and I think it\u2019s an important game for us, the squad, and players without game time. It will be important to start with good focus, good concentration. It\u2019s important always to play good football. If we win this game, it will be a good reward for all the team, not just for some players. I think it\u2019s important to keep our focus. We play at home, it\u2019s another pitch, another atmosphere, and I hope of course we can start strong and put it right for the next round. The star strikers are on the bench at the King Power: Jamie Vardy and Devante Cole; on BT Sport Uwe Rosler is playing down the importance of his decision to relegate Cole to the bench, and playing up the ability of his stand-ins. So PA are getting their game together, and these are the names I\u2019ve been given \u2013 I\u2019ll add the rest as they arrive: Leicester v Fleetwood Town Leicester: Jakupovic, Amartey, Dragovic, Benalouane, Fuchs, Mahrez, Iborra, Adrien Silva, Gray, Iheanacho, Slimani.

Here are the Mansfield and Cardiff teams: The Press Association, the original and most reliable source of teamsheetly news, don\u2019t appear to have this down as one of their priorities tonight. Team news is rolling in. I\u2019ll collate it all in one place once it has all arrived. Hello world! Tonight\u2019s FA Cup games, then. You\u2019ll notice that none of the home teams start with a letter that comes before L in the alphabet, while three of the away teams do. Incredible scenes! Also, and not very promisingly, every single one of their first attempts to find a winner ended in a 0-0 draw 10 days ago. Leicester City v Fleetwood Town This is our report on the first meeting: Mansfield Town v Cardiff City Sheffield Wednesday v Carlisle United West Ham United v Shrewsbury Town Here\u2019s a report on the first encounter: Reading v Stevenage Who knows what fun the football gods have in store for us this evening.
