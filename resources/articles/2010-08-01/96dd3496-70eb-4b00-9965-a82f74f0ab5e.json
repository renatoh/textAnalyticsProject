Our appetite is unsated, our optimism undimmed, and we have cast aside the years of experience which suggest that the scrambled eggs will turn out to have the consistency of a bath sponge, the orange juice will be a totally different colour and flavour to that nice stuff we get back home, and that by the time the meal ends our hunger pangs will have been replaced by a sharp pain in the gut and a generic feeling of queasiness. But still, for one day we can all relax. The only problem is figuring out exactly which day that is. Today marks the start of the Premier League, and has an episode of Match of the Day at the end of it, but it's only the first day of a new season if you don't count the Community Shield. If the curtain was indeed raised at the traditional curtain-raiser this would be the seventh day of the season, though there's a strong argument for saying that last Saturday, when there was a full fixture list in the Football League, was when it all really began. However if that's the case, Norwich v Watford the previous evening must be when the ball truly got rolling. Whatever, we can all surely agree that by tonight the season will have begun. But, like an elephant's ear or the entire city of London when viewed on Google Earth, this is a very grey area. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger believes that mid-October, after the last of the autumn internationals, \"is the real start of the season, because there is now no big interruptions any more\". \"The season doesn't really get going until November,\" the Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard said once. Steve McClaren, the former Manchester United assistant manager, is a particular expert in this field (his success with FC Twente last season sadly prevents me from making a joke here about his lack of expertise in more useful kinds of field, though it's still tempting): \"It's February/March time, that's when the season really starts for me,\" he said in 2004. The following year he put even that date back a bit, encouraging his former side in their ultimately futile attempt to win the league title by saying: \"They know the season doesn't really start until you get down to the last 10 games. Then it's down to luck, nerve and injuries.\" But they didn't know that at all. For even at United, even from Sir Alex Ferguson, there is no consistency. \"Alex Ferguson always used to say that the season didn't really start until February or March,\" said Teddy Sheringham, an assertion that was hotly disputed by Darren Fletcher, who asserted that \"the manager always says Christmas is the period when the season really starts\". The truth is that Ferguson's seasons begin neither in December nor in February but sometime in between. As he said last January: \"The season really starts now.\" It is immaterial. After all, a league is just an artificial construct designed to add significance to a large number of football matches. Its brilliance comes from the fact that the longer the season drags on, and the more our natural enthusiasm is dimmed by the sheer quantity of football we have been asked to consume, the greater the significance it adds. Right now, it is long enough after our last exposure to club football for us happily to take what we're given. This weekend's matches may come to be seen, many months from now, as crucial, but for now they are encounters without real context. Winning is obviously good, but we do not yet know why. Only in the season's first flush can games be enjoyed so purely, for nothing but the drama generated on the field over 90 minutes. By April, when what we could call the McClaren Season gets under way, next March the context, the implications of a result, will in many cases be more meaningful than the manner in which it is achieved. Much as the excitement of a promotion chase, or the flight from relegation, or the scrap to finish seventh in the Premier League and thus earn a place in the third qualification round of the Europa League, has the capacity to thrill, this is the time I cherish most of all. And soon it will be hard to find a competitive match that can be enjoyed in isolation. Unless, that is, we uproot ourselves from our comfort zone and find a game with a context we neither know nor particularly care about. A campaign has begun to designate 4 September, the next Saturday without fixtures in the Premier League or the Championship, as Non\u2011League Day, the idea being that fans of football who happen to support big clubs will spend their free afternoon a little further down the football pyramid. If you're in England, you can find your nearest fixture here. There are any number of reasons to support this initiative, genuinely important ones to do with community and the future of sport, but above all I will welcome the opportunity to watch two teams boot the ball about for 90 minutes for a very important reason that isn't entirely clear to me. www.twitter.com/simon_burnton"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
