Well, he was a big man. London chairman of Ukip, a parliamentary candidate. Stood for the party in Scotland in last year's European elections. A man of many parts. According to his biog, he toured the world as a keyboard player with Stevie Wonder and Jean-Michel Jarre. He has shot films in Mexico, Belize and Switzerland. But late at night he felt moved to vent his anger on asylum to communitycare.co.uk. The rest was all downhill. \"You left-wing scum are all the same,\" he posted. \"Wanting to hand our birthright to Romanian gypsies who beat their wives and children into begging and stealing money they can gamble with, Muslim nutters who want to kill us and put us all under medieval Sharia law, the same Africans who sold their Afro-Caribbean brothers into a slavery that Britain was the first to abolish (but you still want to apologise for!). Worry about where we are going to live and grow food, you wanker, not the Ukip policy that might just save your worthless skin!.\" The end came quickly. We rang Ukip, and though he seemed quite defiant when we rang him, they last night suspended him from any party position with a view to disciplinary proceedings. He was a character. But he hardly seemed very nice. \u2022 Steve Tierney is different. He's a businessman, a Tory county councillor in Cambridgeshire and he doesn't like the Guardian very much \u2013 \"a horrible, snivelly, limp-wristed, weak little rag\". But we'll let that pass. The problem is that some might think him slightly dim. For he was taken in by the April Fool's confection in the Guardian yesterday \u2013 the one that suggested a more openly macho Gordon might biff David Cameron, push Andrew Marr and manhandle Jeremy Paxman for electoral advantage. But not just Steve was taken in. Quite a few were taken in. He was outraged. \"Gordon Brown isn't 'hard',\" he blogged righteously. \"He isn't a 'bruiser' and he isn't a 'great clunking fist'. He's not going to walk up to anybody and call them outside for a playground push'n'shove. And if he did, he'd quickly find himself out of breath, sweaty and chagrined.\" When he realised how gullible he'd been, he probably felt the same. \u2022 With Rupert Murdoch having set his face and his mighty organisation against Gordon Brown and all of Labour's works, heartening isn't it to see the Times's acclaimed sportswriter Matthew Syed on the hastily compiled shortlist of six to replace the late Ashok Kumar in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland? Result on Saturday. He had better win. \u2022 And so what if Lord Tebbit suffered the indignity of receiving \"words of advice\" from a Suffolk policeman last weekend following his little local difficulty during Chinese New Year celebrations in Bury St Edmunds? If you take the fire from his belly, what would you have left? But we worry that within a few days of resolving one issue, he was telling our man about another potential flashpoint. \"I'm sure someone referred to me the other day as 'a silly old blogger',\" said Tebbit, 78, who does indeed have a new home on the web. \"If my hearing was still perfect I might well have said something, but since it's not quite what it was, I let it pass \u2013 and probably avoided getting myself into a whole lot of trouble.\" That's right, Norman. Bird's not worth it. Turn the other cheek. Walk away. \u2022 Finally, the warm words are all very well but what price transparency? \"When I met David Cameron (pictured) recently in a restaurant, I introduced myself to him, and he denied being the Tory leader,\" complains author and one-time Tory Dominic Shelmerdine. \"I was most unamused that this wannabe prime minister should behave in this manner.\" But he shouldn't have been surprised: for once, while serving time as a public relations executive at Carlton Television, the Tory leader apparently dodged a hostile telephone call by pretending to be the cleaner. We all grow up, but old habits die hard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
