Now Michael Peterson, of Los Alamos National Laboratory, is using the pulses of illumination to produce \u201cfulminograms\u201d showing clouds from inside. \u201cThe output resembles an x-ray image of the storm,\u201d Peterson says. \u201cWhen light must penetrate thick convective cells, they stand out as dark spots in the image, while the brightest spots show us where lots of light can leak out of the cloud.\u201d Peterson\u2019s work is described in a paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres. The x-ray effect produces a map of the cloud density, giving an idea of the anatomy of the storm beneath its dark exterior. \u201cLightning measurements allow us to look through the anvil shield of intense thunderstorms to sense the dynamics at the heart of convection,\u201d he says. As well as giving close-up detail, the wide view from the GLM satellite means it should be possible to follow the progress of many storms simultaneously and provide weather warnings across a wide area. \u201cWe\u2019re essentially trying to use lightning to create something akin to a simple weather radar for all thunderstorms across the Americas for now, and later across the globe,\u201d Peterson says. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 October 2019 to correct the spelling of Michael Peterson.
