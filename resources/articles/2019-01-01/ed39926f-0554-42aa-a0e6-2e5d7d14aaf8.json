The former MP used his weekly programme on TalkRadio to repeatedly criticise claims of Russian involvement in the incident. He mocked those who agreed with the UK government that the Kremlin was behind the novichok nerve agent attack on the former Russian security agent and his daughter. Ofcom said it was minded to sanction TalkRadio, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK, for broadcasting the discussion last March without giving enough time to people with opposing views. Galloway said the media regulator had engaged in a \u201ctransparently politically motivated attempt at censorship\u201d that was designed to stifle his \u201clone voice\u201d on the airwaves. On the show, broadcast 12 days after the poisoning last March, Galloway repeatedly poured scorn on the British government\u2019s claims of Russian involvement in the attempted murder and pointed out that Salisbury was close to the UK\u2019s chemical research laboratory at Porton Down. Galloway suggested there was no reason for Russia to have carried out the attack: \u201cI\u2019m not saying the Russian intelligence services are above such a crime,\u201d he told listeners. \u201cThey have committed many such crimes, just like every other intelligence agency in the world, including \u2013 and perhaps particularly \u2013 our own. Don\u2019t get me started on intelligence services. The question is, why?\u201d Galloway then read 11 text messages from listeners, all broadly supportive of his views on the events in Salisbury, according to Ofcom. At one point, he broke from a discussion with an employee of the leftwing website The Canary to read a tweet from a London taxi driver that said: \u201cI haven\u2019t found a passenger who believes this story all week.\u201d TalkRadio argued that \u201cGalloway\u2019s colourful critique would be regarded by listeners as a highly opinionated personal view attack\u201d and therefore did not require a counterbalance. It said Galloway\u2019s producer made an effort to find guests to appear on the show and make the case for Russian involvement in the Salisbury poisoning, but \u201call of them declined\u201d. The radio station said it had since talked to Galloway about the need to include contrary voices on his show and, if a guest could not be booked, a TalkRadio presenter should come on air to challenge Galloway and provide an alternative viewpoint. The media regulator has already announced its intention to sanction the Kremlin-funded RT television station for breaking impartiality rules following the Salisbury poisoning. Two of the breaches related to programmes hosted by Galloway."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
