The biggest DNA analysis of whole human genomes will shed light on why some people are more at risk of developing a serious illness. A coalition of 50 groups, including 24 leading human geneticists, has completed a study which in the course of the next year will reveal genetic signposts for heart disease, diabetes, bipolar disorder and hypertension. The findings will mark the biggest single leap in the understanding of how genes dictate our propensity to get ill, opening the door to a new wave of tailored therapies and tests to predict the likelihood that people will develop a serious illness. They have also raised fears that people will abdicate responsibility for living healthily if they discover they have the genetic markers for conditions including obesity, hypertension and type II diabetes. Mark Walport, director of the Wellcome Trust, which sponsors the programme, said: \"This is the first time that anyone has been able to look at genetic variations at this scale - results for some other diseases are as important as those for obesity.\" Genetic tests are currently available for specific genetic disorders, but the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium is looking at the more mild and multiple genetic variations which combine with environmental factors to give a person an increased risk of developing a disease. This week Exeter and Oxford Universities revealed a genetic variation responsible for obesity carried by one in six people and documented how having one copy makes you on average 1.2 kilos fatter and two copies three kilos larger than average. Over the coming months, the consortium will release similarly detailed findings in major journals for eight common illnesses. The researchers have analysed 19,000 DNA samples, which include 2,000 for people who suffer from each of the diseases and a control group of 3,000. Separately, they are examining 15,000 markers for genetic variations relating to another four diseases - breast cancer, autoimmune thyroid disease, multiple sclerosis, and ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic swelling of the joints. Peter Donnelly, consortium chair, said: \"We are trying to identify the genetic factors which make some people more likely to develop a disease than others. We know genetics play a part but we haven't found the parts of the genome involved.\" Cardiff psychiatrists taking part will reveal genetic variations which dictate the probability a person will develop bipolar disorder. \"The genes will tell us which biological systems are involved and allow us to predict who is at risk,\" said Nick Craddock, leading the bipolar disorder research. Some scientists have warned that genetic testing could be problematic where genes are identified before therapies exist, meaning that people could be told that they have a risk of developing an illness, with no options to treat it. There are also fears that testing will fuel the fledgling commercial market for genetic testing and that people will not receive the counselling required to react to a positive result for an illness. FAQ: Secrets revealed What genetic tests are available? Those for rare illnesses such as cystic fibrosis which are caused by a single dramatic genetic disorder. What about more common illnesses? That's what these scientists are working on: milder gene variations which, when combined with environmental factors, increase a person's risk. What do genes tell us? Variation on the genes will hint at what mechanism is affected when a condition arises. But they will also lead to more general genetic testing which gives an indication of someone's likelihood of falling ill. What tests can I get? A doctor will offer a test for serious disorders if a family pattern is seen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
