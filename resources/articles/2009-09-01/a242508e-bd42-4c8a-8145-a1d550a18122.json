If you're familiar with Matt Groening's animated sitcom, and it still leaves you cold, you clearly have no sense of humour. Why not get a job with Fox? Those morons let Futurama die in 2003, and although it is now back, it has lost a little of its freshness. The original four series, however, have all of that new-car smell and none of that zombie lurch. Philip J Fry, a stupid but good-natured pizza delivery boy, is accidentally frozen in 1999 and defrosts 1,000 years later, where he becomes . . . well, a delivery boy, only now he uses a spaceship. His fellow losers at Planet Express include Leela, a one-eyed mutant from the sewers of New New York, with whom Fry falls pathetically and unrequitedly in love; the alcoholicPhil, whoremongering robot Bender, who inevitably becomes Fry's best friend; and the company doctor, a rubbish-eating lobster-thing called Zoidberg. This is not the shiny future imagined by Star Trek or even Iain M Banks. Global warming has been tackled, but only by shipping in giant ice cubes from Halley's comet. Christmas is a time of terror and destruction, when a robot Santa rains death down from the sky. There's a suicide booth on every corner, and Earth's president is Richard Nixon \u2013 or rather his bodiless head. Meanwhile, interstellar order is maintained by a kind of anti-Kirk, the spineless (and knickerless and trouserless) Captain Zapp Brannigan. Kids love it, of course, and so long as you're not worried about the drinking, crime, inappropriate sexual behaviour and so on, sitting them in front of a DVD will guarantee you a few hours' peace and quiet. You, meanwhile, should get the satire \u2013 not just of science-fiction, but of dumbed-down culture, capitalism, religion . . . If you can watch a single episode and not be hooked, then, in Bender's immortal words, bite my shiny metal ass."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
