In the wake of the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal, the Crown Prosecution Service has established improved liaison systems between agencies for sharing details about potential victims. The CPS report also contains an annex detailing common myths and stereotypes used in court to challenge the reliability of victims' evidence and matching instructions to prosecutors to ensure the jury do not dismiss it through \"unwarranted scepticism\". Among myths listed are that: the victim invited sex by the way they dressed or acted; the victim used alcohol or drugs and was therefore sexually available; the victim didn't scream, fight or protest so they must have been consenting; and the victim didn't complain immediately, so it can't have been a sexual assault. Prosecutors are reminded to point out that a person under 16 can never consent to sex under any circumstances, because someone is drunk or drugged does not mean they are a willing partner, that some victims experience a \"freeze\" response to trauma, and that feelings of shame and guilt may inhibit a victim from making a complaint. The guidelines cautions that: \"There is no one model of child sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of children and young people can be perpetrated by family members, family friends, girlfriends and boyfriends, gangs, 'peer on peer', strangers, adults via the internet and people in positions of trust such as teachers or carers.\" On the question of whether courts, local government, police, CPS or social services should divulge confidential information about possible victims, the new protocol states: \"Lack of consent to share information is irrelevant where there is a clear concern about a risk of harm to the child or young person.\" Police and prosecutors are now expected to share and seek appropriate information about vulnerable youngsters with and from social services, schools and family courts, the guidelines advise. The CPS document also recommends that police are expected to search for indecent images of young children \u2013 a common theme in many abuse cases. The latest advice, following a three month consultation, updates interim prosecution guidance issued earlier this summer. The director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, said: \"This change marks the most fundamental attitude shift across the criminal justice system for a generation. For too long, child sexual abuse cases have been plagued by myths about how 'real' victims behave which simply do not withstand scrutiny. \"The final guidelines ... confirm that the now accepted approach is that the prosecution must focus on the overall credibility of an allegation rather than the perceived weakness of the person making it. Sharing information, such as school files which may help police and prosecutors piece together compelling evidence of abuse, will now be done.\" Alison Worsley, deputy director of strategy at Barnardo's, said: \"We must make sure we always listen to what children are telling us, often through their behaviour rather than just words, and consign stereotypes and myths to the history books. The challenge comes now for police and prosecutors to live up to the word of the guidance and make the crucial changes needed in practice.\" Emily Thornberry MP, the shadow attorney general, said: \"These proposals are a welcome effort to correct the over-cautious stance the CPS took in the Jimmy Savile and street-grooming cases. \"However, the guidance contains a lot more 'shoulds' than 'musts' which makes me wonder how much of it will actually be implemented.\" Ann Coffey MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group for runaway and missing children, also welcomed the new guidelines but said that urgent action was also needed to tackle the problem of aggressive cross examination by defence barristers in court. She said: \"Tackling the problems in prosecuting child sexual abuse cases is just one half of the story but tackling the grotesque abuses by defence lawyers in court is the other half of the story that needs addressing. Barristers in child sex abuse cases must be stopped from manipulating child witnesses like puppets in the witness box.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
