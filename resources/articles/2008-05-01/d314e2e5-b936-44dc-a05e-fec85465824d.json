That night, Welch broke off mid-song to jump into a nearby swimming pool. She clambered back out again to finish the song, despite the risk of electrocution. Brooklyn psychonauts du jour MGMT, meanwhile, have a history of audience-baiting. At one of their early gigs, they apparently cut open a durian and passed it around the audience. Then they sacrificed it with a machete. The durian is no ordinary tropical fruit. It smells like rotting flesh. A night in the company of Welch, Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser promises to be many things - an assault on the senses, perhaps - but definitely not boring. But here are MGMT, expanded to a touring five-piece, jamming indulgently for what seems like an entire geological period. Large reptiles die out. Silt covers their bones. Children dig up their fossils with their plastic spades. Still, the keyboards and effects pedals whang on and hired guitarist James Richardson solos, gurning like a basket-weaver with piles. On their excellent debut album, Oracular Spectacular, MGMT's prog influences are kept tightly in check, overwhelmed by Bowie steals, electro-funk, wide-eyed psychedelia and a mischievous pop intellect. 'Time to Pretend', their super-catchy single and calling card, at once celebrates and satirises the indulgent rock lifestyle. It aptly played out the last series of Skins. When iTunes featured it as its single of the week, God-fearing America went on the offensive, aghast at its litany of rude words and drug references (the only ones on the album, in fact). Live, though, MGMT's influences shrink, their IQ withers, their vim droops and their lustrousness fades. Despite selling out bigger venues, they haven't stepped up their game from their last UK tour. They are not space-cadet imps fed on honeydew. They are superannuated students playing Yes covers. I want to cry. Only VanWyngarden, the singing guitarist, has made any effort to channel the South Seas psycho-tropical look of their album artwork and photographs. Everyone else looks like a penurious slacker temping Beavishly in a guitar shop. Where is the band who wore capes on David Letterman? Where are the feathers, lasers and tribal drums their album deserves? Where is the lurid Lord of the Flies stage set? They ought to be able to afford one. MGMT infamously signed to Columbia records for a four-album deal. They plastered the company's logo as large as possible over their CD, in an effort to distance themselves from what they perceived as the small-thinking indie mindset of their Brooklyn peers, many of whom are sharing plaudits this year with MGMT (Vampire Weekend, for one). Where is the band who asked Columbia to engage Barack Obama to produce their record? Not here. Despite three rallies around their pop gems - 'Time to Pretend', 'The Youth' and 'Kids' - MGMT manage to drive half their audience away by the bitter end. They make us doubly grateful for Florence and her Machine. She might look like a gypsy cheerleader with her white rah-rah skirt and dangling gold jewellery, but she is a dangerous musical predator. At least half of her thumping six-song support set is awash with blood. Accompanied by a drummer and guitarist (her Machine changes personnel regularly) 'Girl With One Eye' tells the tale of a woman who 'sleeps with one eye open'. Flo cut out the other in revenge for messing with her man. 'Bird Song', meanwhile, is about a bird that has the misfortune of witnessing some dark deed of Florence Welch's. He pays for it with his life. Then there's her imminent single, 'Kiss With a Fist', a rollicking, blow-by-blow account of domestic violence. Welch delivers these riveting tunes with a voice that's bluesy and full of belly. Occasionally, the loud guitar and drums drown out even her mighty voice; most of her stuff online is barely more than a capella. With her 'oh, oh ohs' and references to bricks, there is a slight risk that Welch could end up being pigeonholed as Kate Nash with a bodycount. But she is too weird and wonderful for that, as extraordinary a talent as MGMT's is ordinary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
