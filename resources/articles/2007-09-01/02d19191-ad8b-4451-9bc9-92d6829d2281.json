And what happens? Instead of approaching the most important match of his tenure with every tactical nuance in place, the sky has fallen in on Brian Ashton's head. He could yet end up with a fly-half who has never filled the role in a senior club game, not to mention a goalkicker who has yet to register a single point for his team. These things occasionally happen in amateur rugby but England has never known a chapter of accidents like it. If it was not so serious, it would qualify as a classic French farce. First Jonny Wilkinson twists his right ankle in a freak accident. His replacement Olly Barkley plays well in the opening match against the United States but then suffers a hip injury which is also threatening to rule him out of the big one against the Boks. England do not have another specialist fly-half or a specialist goalkicker available; the next two cabs off the rank, Toby Flood and Charlie Hodgson, are back in England still gutted at having missed out on the original 30-man squad. The captain Phil Vickery, meanwhile, is required in central Paris at a disciplinary hearing. Ashton must feel trapped in a vision of coaching hell. To make matters worse the management have been forced to revise their plans because of form as much as fitness. Danny Hipkiss has tonsillitis and Mathew Tait has a stomach upset - both have been isolated from their team-mates as a precaution. But the most notable absentees on yesterday's team-sheet were fully fit and keen to play; ditching Lawrence Dallaglio and Joe Worsley can only be viewed as a brutal demotion despite Ashton's insistence that squad players, by definition, cannot be axed in mid-tournament. With Jason Robinson switched to full-back - where he has not played for England since February 2005 - after months of steadfast refusal by Ashton to consider him at No15, there is even more of a sense of the emergency cord being pulled. Mark Cueto, apparently, is still suffering from a nagging groin problem, which might explain his diffident showing against the US Eagles. Paul Sackey, who might not have made the original party had David Strettle not been injured, is on the left wing with Josh Lewsey on the right flank. In their biggest game for four years England have ended up with a back three who have never played together before. As for the back row, the chosen triumvirate of Martin Corry, Tom Rees and Nick Easter all have considerable individual virtues; stick Corry's whole-hearted effort, Rees's pace and Easter's hands together and you have a potentially top-class unit. The giveaway word, unfortunately for Ashton, is \"potentially\". The only previous occasion the three have been selected together was against France in Marseille last month when England made precious little headway and should have lost by a wider margin than 22-9. If England do end up starting either Andy Farrell or Mike Catt at No10, furthermore, it would also mean Shaun Perry having to link up with his sixth different fly-half in 14 Tests. No wonder England struggle for consistency. Circumstances have now robbed them of Wilkinson, Cueto, Mike Tindall, Harry Ellis and Dan Ward-Smith, all of whom might have strengthened the spine of Ashton's team had they stayed fit and enjoyed an extended run of games. In the goalkicking department, above all, it is time for England supporters to cross all available digits. If Barkley and Wilkinson are both unavailable, the options are strictly limited as Catt's back no longer permits regular place-kicking and the reserve scrum-half, Andy Gomarsall, is only a part-time marksman. Short of pitching Flood or Hodgson - or Shane Geraghty or Danny Cipriani - straight into a frenzied encounter with the Boks, Ashton has no other option but to trust in Farrell, whose last kick at goal in an international match was for Great Britain's rugby league team against Australia in Leeds three years ago. \"Whatever happens I'm happy to do it,\" Farrell insisted yesterday. \"I've been around long enough to know that if you miss you're a villain and if you kick them all you're a hero.\" When Ashton took the top job he never imagined it would come to this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
