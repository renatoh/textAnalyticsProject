The midfielder opened the scoring for Fulham today against Middlesbrough and received a standing ovation as he was substituted with five minutes remaining, but media reports have put Bullard's future in south west London as negotiations over his contract continue. \"I think that I and the rest of the players can feel quite aggrieved that all press conferences revolve around one man. That doesn't seem to be correct,\" said Hodsgon, who compared the Bullard scenario to the Cristiano Ronaldo transfer saga this summer. \"I don't want to lose him, I don't want to put a figure on the guys head, I hope he is going to be playing for us for the rest of the season. When you're a club like us of course you can't say no one is ever going to leave, even the top clubs like Arsenal and Liverpool can't be absolutely certain [they will keep their players].\" Bullard has been linked with a move to Blackburn Rovers or Bolton, but Hodgson said that television reports on Friday claiming that the 30-year-old would be free to leave in January were incorrect: \"I made it very clear, but I was very concerned when I saw the scrolls yesterday on the television \u2014 what on earth have I said and how have they interpreted it. Luckily I've had the benefit of seeing myself on television, which I don't like happening very much but I went out of my way to see how they managed to interpret what I've said in that way.\" Hodgson said he was happy with his squad and he is keen for January to pass without incident, before adding that the club would \"have to take a position\" if any big offers were received: \"I don't want players to leave. If I have to accept that there is no money to improve the squad and I'll probably accept that as well. At this moment in time I would quite happily sign a contract saying no one in, no one out of the squad for the rest of the year. That is my position on the subject. \"If a big offer comes in for one of our best players I and the club will have to take a position on that,\" added Hodgson who will celebrate his first anniversary at Fulham on 28 December, while the former Wigan player only returned to the Fulham team after 15 months out with a knee injury last January, something Hodgson was keen to highlight. \"It's also quite strange that all is this talk is going on about a player who has a year and a half of his contract left to run, has missed a year's football through injury and is being nursed back into this type of form by the club during the year when he couldn't play at all.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
