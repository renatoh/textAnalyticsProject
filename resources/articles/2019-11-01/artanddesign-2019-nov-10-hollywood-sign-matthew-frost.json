The Los Angeles film-maker built up a collection: monks in orange robes goofing around; a mother in a onesie; an Irish travel blogger; a bemused park ranger; a barefoot woman with a sweatshirt tied round her neck; four Valley girls on their way to brunch; a Dynamo Moscow fan taking a picture of the team\u2019s mascot; a Chinese family in Levi\u2019s T-shirts; \u201csome German guys in blue\u201d. The photographs are now collected in a book, I Saw The Sign, which tells us something about celebrity, something about tourism and something about capturing moments in time. For Frost, not knowing what he\u2019s going to find up at the sign gives his routine a precious sense of the unknown. \u201cPeople line up to stand on these two rocks that sit in the path,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s symbolic, because it doesn\u2019t really change your perspective. It\u2019s funny, because we\u2019re used to people posing for selfies in front of [the Leaning Tower of] Pisa or the Louvre. These two rocks are so incongruous.\u201d Frost\u2019s book is less about the vista of the Hollywood sign than about the universal desire of people wanting to come together, share a moment and create memories. \u201cHopefully the accumulation of pictures becomes something else,\u201d Frost says. \u201cInstead of me thinking about my little life on my morning run, I disrupted by seeing people gathered around a rock in front of a sign that has no real meaning other than some folklore of LA. \u201cLA is so much about self-promotion and brand-building but this isn\u2019t that, or if it is, it\u2019s at the most basic level. In these pictures people, I think, want to show their togetherness. Or that, at least, is my intention.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
