Caballero is Claudio Bravo\u2019s deputy and although the Chilean remains City\u2019s No1 if his unreliable form were to continue Guardiola would have to decide whether to recruit an understudy or a goalkeeper who could provide direct competition. Caballero joined the club in summer 2014, being signed from M\u00e1laga by the previous manager Manuel Pellegrini, who promised the Argentinian he would have a chance to vie with Joe Hart for the No1 jersey. However, Caballero never established himself under Pellegrini, though he did claim a Capital One Cup winners\u2019 medal following an impressive display in the final last year, saving three penalties in the shootout. Hart is on loan at Torino and although he will return to City in the summer there seems little prospect of him being able to re-establish himself under Guardiola. The Catalan\u2019s lack of faith in Hart moved him to sign Bravo from Barcelona."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
