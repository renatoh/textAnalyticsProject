The Aidan O'Brien-trained colt was yesterday slashed to 9-2 from 8-1 by Coral for the Group One sprint at York on Thursday week, just half a point behind the 4-1 ante-post market leader, The Tatling. One Cool Cat is also an 8-1 shot with Coral for the Stanleybet Sprint Cup at Haydock, which is on the agenda for Ashdown Express (10-1) after his good fourth behind Somnus in the Prix Maurice de Gheest at Deauville on Sunday. \"We were very pleased with the way he ran - slightly faster ground might have been more in his favour, but I'm not going to look for any excuses,\" said Chris Wall, trainer of Ashdown Express. \"We'll see how he is and we'll probably aim him for the Haydock sprint. But often it comes up very soft ground there. \"The day before the Haydock race there is a Group Two sprint in Germany at Baden-Baden and we might switch him to that instead. We've got a few options round about that time.\" Lion Heart, runner-up in the Kentucky Derby, was cut to 8-1 from 16-1 for the Breeders Cup Classic by Coral after winning the Grade One Haskell Invitational Handicap at Monmouth Park, New Jersey, on Sunday night. The Patrick Biancone-trained three-year-old, who was also fourth in the Preakness Stakes, made all to beat Snookie's Boy by a length under Joe Bravo in the nine furlong event. Lion Heart, owned by Michael Tabor and Derrick Smith, is now due to contest the Grade One Travers Stakes at Saratoga on August 28."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
