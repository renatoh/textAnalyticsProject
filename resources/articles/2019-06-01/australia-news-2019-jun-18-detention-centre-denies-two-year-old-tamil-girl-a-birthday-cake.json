It was her second birthday inside the Melbourne detention centre and the second time visitors were blocked from bringing in a cake to celebrate, despite her father, Nades, going through the required rigorous application process, including submitting a \u201cspecial purpose food and/or medication request\u201d to Border Force. The form stipulated the conditions for a cake, including that it had to be consumed in the visits area and could \u201conly be shared with the detainee for which the visit has been approved\u201d. It could not be taken back to detainees\u2019 accommodation, and any leftovers had to be thrown out. \u201cHonestly, are we now at the point of denying a two-year-old a birthday cake?,\u201d said shadow immigration minister, Kristina Keneally. \u201cNo one denies there are rules in place, but surely common sense and compassion cuts in somewhere, even in the Morrison government.\u201d Guardian Australia has previously reported on complaints about rules and regulations which have affected the physical and mental health of detainees and their visitors. Tharunicaa and her sister Kopika, aged 4, were last month allowed to go to a playgroup for the first time, but the excursion hasn\u2019t been repeated. In May it was revealed Tharunicaa\u2019s teeth were in extremely poor health, and her mother, Priya, claimed she was being denied proper treatment. Medical records suggested the dental issues were due to vitamin deficiencies and lack of sunlight in the first year of their detention. A friend of the family said on Sunday the nerves of four teeth are now exposed, and the child requires surgery. The Biloela family has spent 15 months in detention since they were arrested in a dawn raid on their Queensland home over a one-day visa overstay. Separate asylum claims have been rejected, and ministerial intervention is their only avenue to stay in Australia. The family has pointed to recent terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, one of which occurred in the parents\u2019 home town, in claiming they fear for their safety if returned. Tharunicaa and Kopika are among at least five children being held in the Melbourne immigration transit accommodation. Thehome affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has repeatedly claimed that there are no children in detention. But the Sri Lankan children and their parents are in what\u2019s called a residential precinct, which thehome affairs department describes as an \u201calternative place of detention\u201d. The department also refers to people held within it as \u201cdetainees\u201d. While the residential precinct has some benefits which are not afforded to other detainees \u2013 such as limited self-catering \u2013 they are under guard, prevented from leaving the centre, and required to adhere to strict rules and visiting guidelines. A report by the Australian Human Rights Commission, released on Monday, found that while the residential precincts were \u201cfar less harsh and restrictive\u201d than other detention environments, \u201cclosed immigration detention generally should not be used for people who are vulnerable, and should never be used for children\u201d. \u201cThe commission therefore questions whether the ongoing use of closed immigration detention, even under less restrictive conditions, is necessary, reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances of the people detained at the BRP,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe commission considers that community-based alternatives to detention should be used routinely for children, families and people who are vulnerable, with conditions varied as needed to manage identified risks.\u201d The report found that Australia\u2019s onshore immigration detention was \u201cunlike any other liberal democracy\u201d and increasingly prison-like."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
