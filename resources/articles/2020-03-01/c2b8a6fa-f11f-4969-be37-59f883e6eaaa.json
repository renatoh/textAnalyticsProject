Dutton released a statement late on Friday confirming that he had gone into self-isolation after testing positive for the virus. The home affairs minister had recently returned from a trip to the US where he held meetings with senior Trump administration officials including Ivanka Trump, the US attorney-general, William Barr, and officials from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. In a statement, the White House said it was aware Dutton had contracted the virus, but that senior officials would not need to quarantine because the minister was \u201casymptomatic during the interaction\u201d. Instead the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser Ivanka, who was photographed next to Dutton during the trip, worked from home on Friday \u201cout of an abundance of caution and until guidance was given\u201d. \u201cThe White House is aware that Mr Dutton tested positive for Covid-19,\u201d the White House said. \u201cHe was asymptomatic during the interaction. Exposures from the case were assessed and the White House Medical Unit confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that Ivanka is exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine. \u201cShe worked from home today out of an abundance of caution until guidance was given.\u201d A spokesman for the attorney general William Barr also said the Attorney General would work from home on Friday but was not showing coronavirus symptoms. \u201cHe is staying home today and has consulted with CDC,\u201d Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement. \u201cCDC is not recommending he be tested at this point.\u201d Other officials including a senior counsellor to the president, Kellyanne Conway, said she had been advised she did not need to quarantine. \u201cWhite House Medical Unit (WHMU) informed me earlier that Mr Dutton was asymptomatic during the interaction,\u201d Conway wrote on Twitter. \u201cExposures from the case were assessed and the WHMU confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that I exhibited no symptoms &amp; need not self-quarantine.\u201d But New Zealand cabinet minister Tracey Martin, who met with Dutton during a Five-Eyes partners meeting in Washington DC, has reportedly gone into self-isolation following his diagnosis. A spokesperson for Martin told Radio New Zealand that while the minister and New Zealand First had shown no symptoms, she had been tested for the virus and was self-isolating until test results were returned. Martin reportedly did not shake Dutton\u2019s hand when she was overseas. On Tuesday Dutton attended a meeting with Australian cabinet members including the prime minister, Scott Morrison. He was also was part of a discussion of the national security committee of cabinet on Thursday via a video link. However Morrison said late on Friday that he did not intend to be tested and that no one in the cabinet would be required to self-isolate. The prime minister did cancel plans to attend a football match in Sydney on Saturday. Speaking to radio station 2GB on Saturday, Dutton, said he woke with symptoms including a fever, sore throat and a slight shortness of breath on Friday morning. But he said that he\u2019d spoken to Queensland Health authorities on Friday night who had begun contact tracing back to Wednesday morning and were not concerned about his earlier contacts. His wife and children had not displayed symptoms but were self-isolating. \u201cTheir advice to me is they\u2019re concerned with people that I\u2019ve had close contact with since the morning of the 11th. So beyond that, it\u2019s not further back, there\u2019s some speculation about my visit to the White House etcetera but all the medical advice says there\u2019s no issue in relation to that period or even cabinet earlier in the week. That\u2019s the very clear medical advice that I got from Queensland Health.\u201d Dutton is not the first person to be diagnosed with the coronavirus to have recently come into contact with senior members of the US government. On Friday the White House said the president, Donald Trump, had no plans to be tested for coronavirus or go into self-quarantine after attending events last weekend with a senior Brazilian official who tested positive for the illness. Fabio Wajngarten, a communications secretary to Jair Bolsonaro, met with Trump during a visit by the Brazilian president to Florida. On Thursday the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said both Trump and the vice-president Mike Pence, who was also at the meeting, had \u201calmost no interactions\u201d with Wajngarten and therefore did not need to be tested themselves. But during the visit Wajngarten shared on Instagram a picture of himself, Trump, Pence and Brazilian TV presenter Alvaro Garnero, while in one video, Wajngarten (wearing glasses) was seen just behind Bolsonaro and Trump."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
