Luca Mori was looking at Google Earth images of the region around his town of Sorbolo, near Parma, when he noticed a shaded oval area more than 500 metres (1,640ft) long, which marked the path of an ancient river. He reasoned that curious rectangular shadows nearby must be a buried structure and alerted the National Archaeological Museum of Parma. Ceramic fragments found at the site indicate a Roman villa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
