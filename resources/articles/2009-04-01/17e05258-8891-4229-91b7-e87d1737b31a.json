After Saturday's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Chelsea he criticised it for not being flat and, having had time to take stock, he declared there was no worse pitch in top-flight English football. \"It's the worst. In the Premier League it's 21st position,\" he said. \"Before, everybody wanted to play at Wembley because the pitch was so special. Now, nobody wants to play at Wembley because the pitch is so bad. When you spend \u00a3800m [on Wembley], I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a good pitch. \"If you go to a dentist and he says, 'Listen, I have a tool but it's from 1950,' you go to another dentist with a modern instrument. Football is the same. If they try to make you play on a pitch of 20 or 30 years ago, then anyone would prefer to play on a new, modern pitch. If the pitch is not right, then nothing else matters.\" Arsenal's clash with Chelsea was a long way from being an enthralling spectacle while the second semi-final 24 hours later, between Everton and Manchester United, finished goalless, with Everton advancing on penalties. The Carling Cup final at the beginning of last month between United and Tottenham Hotspur also finished 0-0, with United winning the shoot-out. \"Did you see a good game at Wembley on Sunday?\" said Wenger. \"You saw a game with very little chances. Have you seen the League Cup final? You saw a game with very little chances. It [the surface] slows the game down and everyone has a chance to come back in the right position because you have to control the ball instead of playing it one-touch and the whole game becomes slower. It is a matter of respect to the fans who pay good money to watch a football game. You will never see a good football match on a bad pitch.\" Wembley has been chosen to host the Champions League final in 2011 and it will also stage football at the 2012 Olympic Games. The FA accepted, in a statement last night, that \"there are still further improvements to be made\". Wenger is relieved there will be no such issues at Anfield where an Arsenal win could, perversely, work against them in their Champions League semi-final against United. A defeat for Liverpool would give United room for manoeuvre in the Premier League, allowing them to rotate players and, perhaps, leave them fresher for the Champions League ties. \"But you can never say to your team 'Take your foot off the pedal,'\" said Wenger. \"It is always better to win your big games because it makes you stronger for the next one. We will have nothing to do with favourising Liverpool or United. \"I have big respect for the Anfield crowd. I will never forget the day when we were leading 5-1 there [in the League Cup in 2007] and they were chanting 'You'll never walk alone' like one man. When you are a manager and you know what you usually get when you are 5-1 down, you have only respect for the city. That would be a bit more difficult at the Emirates.\" Wenger said Robin van Persie was out with a recurrence of his groin problem while his other leading striker, Emmanuel Adebayor, would be rested as a precaution because of a slight hamstring injury. Bacary Sagna returns to the squad after illness but two more defenders, Ga\u00ebl Clichy and Johan Djourou, remain on the sidelines, although both of them players hope to be back for the Champions League semi-final first-leg at United on Wednesday week. The injury update was more alarming on the goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, who will not play in the Old Trafford tie and has emerged as a serious doubt for the return leg six days later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
