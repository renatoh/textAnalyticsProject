Market analysts Datamonitor said insurers need to offer consumers better service rather than simply handing out a cheque in a bid to increase loyalty and attract more business. It added that in an increasingly competitive market place, with most people considering insurance to be a grudge purchase, firms needed to focus on becoming more service-led. Research carried out by Datamonitor found that the majority of people who changed insurance provider said they were moving to get a cheaper deal, but the group added that nearly half of those who stayed with the same company said it was because they were satisfied with the service. Vicki Summerhayes, Datamonitor financial services analyst, said: \"The view is that the claims process is the key moment that an insurer can prove its worth and make the customer see exactly why they have been paying the premium. \"Rather than treating claimants as a blot on a book of business, insurance companies should seek to maximise the benefits that can arise from this point of contact with the customer and provide a positive claims experience.\" She added that insurance firms should take a more individual approach to how they dealt with people's claims and offer different services depending on the age and circumstances of the claimant. She also suggested that insurers could improve relations with customers by setting up deals with suppliers to speed up the time taken for house contents to be replaced or homes repaired. She added that insurers could take this one stage further by offering customers access to items such as cheap electrical goods and car parts even if they were not making a claim."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
