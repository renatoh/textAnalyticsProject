Donald Trump has 214 electoral college votes after gaining one vote in Maine. As of early morning on Friday, Biden holds a tight lead in Nevada, which has six electoral college votes \u2013 just enough to get him over the line. Trump\u2019s lead in Georgia continued to narrow on Thursday and on Friday Biden went 917 votes ahead in the state and putting it him reach of its 16 electoral college votes. More Georgians voted by mail than voted in total in 2016 and these mail-in ballots are skewing blue. As of Thursday afternoon, Trump had led by 13,000 votes in the state. Biden could also net Pennsylvania, which would gain him 20 votes. The state has about 175,000 ballots left to be processed, with around 18,0000 votes separating the two candidates. Biden on Thursday called for patience while the vote is counted while Trump falsely claimed at a White House news conference that he was ahead in legal votes. He was cut off by US TV networks who then corrected his statement. It is still possible for Trump to win Alaska has not yet been called for Trump, but the result is not in doubt: he is expected to win its three electoral college votes, taking him to 217. In order to secure the other 53 votes he requires for victory, he would need to win all four remaining states and their 57 votes: Nevada (six votes), North Carolina (15), Georgia (16), and Pennsylvania (20). What is happening in Arizona? The Associated Press and several other news organisations have called Arizona (with its 11 electoral college votes) for Biden, although other outlets, including NBC, have refrained from doing so. The Guardian relies on the AP to call states. While Biden\u2019s lead in Arizona narrowed slightly on Wednesday night , at 4pm ET on Thursday, with 88% of the estimated votes counted, he held 50.5% of the votes. The Trump campaign has falsely claimed that it has won Arizona and on Wednesday night, Trump supporters descended on the state capitol in Phoenix and chanted \u201cShame on Fox\u201d after the TV news channel also declared Biden the winner in the state. What is happening in Nevada? Nevada still has 190,150 to go through as of 4pm ET on Thursday, 123,554 of which are mail-in ballots or ballots dropped of at in-person locations. Nevada officials said that 90% of the votes that still needed to be counted were from Clark county, which is home to largely Democratic Las Vegas and its surrounding suburbs. By law, ballots postmarked on election day can be counted as long as they are received by 5pm on 10 November, which means counting in the state could continue through the weekend. When will we have a winner? Pennsylvania could be called on Friday. With the state\u2019s 20 electoral votes, that would push Biden over 270 if it\u2019s in his favor. Georgia could also be called on Friday. Trump is threatening to sue his way to re-election Trump and his campaign have sued to halt vote-counting in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Georgia, which have not yet been called by Associated Press, and Michigan, which the AP called for Biden. Judges in Georgia and Michigan quickly dismissed the campaign\u2019s lawsuits on Thursday. Trump\u2019s campaign has also requested a recount in Wisconsin, which AP called for Biden. There is no evidence the campaign\u2019s legal challenges will have a bearing on the election result under the law."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
