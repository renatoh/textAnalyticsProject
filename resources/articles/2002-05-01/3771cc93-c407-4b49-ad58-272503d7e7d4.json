Launching tomorrow in the UK, the GameCube is the final entrant in the latest videogame console battle. But is it worthy of the hype? The machine is certainly attractive - dinky and compact - and contrasts positively with the enormous XBox. However, GameCube looks more like a toy than its competitors. The joypad is a slight disappointment, with loose buttons and a lack of the innovation that normally accompanies Nintendo controllers. But games are the key, and it's here that Nintendo is particularly strong. Historically, Nintendo hardware releases have been accompanied by a Mario game and little else. The GameCube has 22 releases out tomorrow, the largest ever for a console launch, with two from Nintendo itself. Although there is nothing that matches Mario 64 - released with the N64 in 1997 - there is a variety that was sadly lacking then. Luigi's Mansion and Star Wars: Rogue Squadron 2 are the standout games, encapsulating Nintendo's plan to widen its appeal. Luigi's is a gorgeous interactive cartoon, with variety and charm to interest all ages. The basic premise - sucking up ghosts - is superbly executed, although experienced gamers may find it a bit easy. Lucas Arts' Rogue Leader is the most realistic Star Wars game ever and will appeal to older gamers, even if the space blasting action is far from unique. Luckily, the graphics make up for any gameplay conservatism, with a Star Wars universe unmatched elsewhere. The second Nintendo title is Wave Race, a jet ski game that mixes impressive water effects with a solid racing challenge. However, the real difference with GC compared to previous Nintendo launches is the amount of third-party games available. Big publishers such as Acclaim (Burnout, Crazy Taxi) and UbiSoft (Batman Vengeance) are represented, as are Electronic Arts, with Fifa 2002 on the way. Older gamers will be surprised to see once arch-rivals Sega producing games for a Nintendo machine. In fact Sega's Monkey Ball is a launch-day treat whose simple premise - guide your ball-encased monkey to the end of the course - masks a tricky, yet satisfying experience. Other notable releases include THQ's snowboarding sim, Dark Summit, and Konami's ESPN Winter Sports. Overall, this is a well-rounded lineup aimed at a wide age group. Nintendo, which has historically appealed to a younger audience, needed a variety of releases. While the under-18 audience is still profitable, gaming has grown up in recent years. \"Titles like Capcom's Resident Evil show that we are serious about appealing to all ages,\" says Nintendo Europe's David Gosen. Nintendo has also improved relations with third parties. Rob Cooper, managing director of UbiSoft Europe, says: \"From the beginning Nintendo has ensured that third-party publishers have been involved with the GameCube.\" Creating the games seems to be easier as well: \"The power of the machine is easy to harness early on in development. Development teams are able to concentrate on content instead of battling against the hardware,\" says Matt Wilkinson, managing director of Bam Studios. All this is good news for potential owners: it means more games. The ability to link Game Boy Advance to GameCube is only available with one launch title - Sonic Adventure 2 - but the potential is massive. While GameCube doesn't have the high technical specifications of the Xbox, it has made a great start."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
