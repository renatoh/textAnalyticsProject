They had been made to suffer, more than they had expected after a seemingly perfect start, but they were safe now, so nearly there. Two early goals from Ferland Mendy and Karim Benzema had been enough \u2013 just \u2013 to take them to a ninth consecutive win, beating Granada 2-1, and within one victory of winning the title with two games still to go. The longest league will be theirs, secured when it became the shortest: an intense summer tournament in which they never even trailed, let alone lost. When the football restarted after almost 100 days of lockdown, Madrid were second, a club that had won only two of the last 11 La Liga titles on course to miss out on another. But this 11-game mini-league has been good for them. The covid league, as Sergio Ramos called it, meant a tangible target laid before them, something to reach out and take. Zinedine Zidane\u2019s team arrived here having won eight from eight and kept five consecutive clean sheets, leading Barcelona on the head-to-head record with a game in hand. They hadn\u2019t even trailed yet. And didn\u2019t here, either. In these five weeks, Madrid have not always been sparkling but it felt like somehow, someone would find a way through. Few expected it to be the man who did, not this time. Twenty members of Madrid\u2019s squad had scored in the league. Ferland Mendy, signed for \u20ac50m in the summer to offer the defensive stability Marcelo could not, was not one of them. He is now. There was ease in the way in which he ran past V\u00edctor D\u00edaz to the left side of the area and ferocity in the way he hit the shot, the ball flying high into the net at the near post. They had only been playing nine minutes. They only needed half of that to get another, and this time there was a more familiar look to it. A break that began with Darwin Mach\u00eds turning into trouble on the corner of one area ended at Benzema\u2019s feet in the opposite corner of the other. Same place Mendy had been, same conclusion, different means. Cutting back, Benzema bent the ball beyond Rui Silva for his 19th league goal. On the touchline the Granada manager, Diego Mart\u00ednez, swore loudly; to his left, Zidane clapped. It was done, he must have felt, and he wouldn\u2019t have been alone. Madrid played, the ball theirs, moved with a smoothness that belied their speed. It even sounded good. Tac, tac, it went, from one side to the other, through the lines and back again, round and round. Occasionally there was a shout. Carva, go. Case, Case. Tac, tac. Bats and swallows dived over the stadium, a high-pitched serenade to accompany the percussive rhythm. Tac, tac. Luka, wait. Tac, tac. Open, open. Tac, tac. The ease with which Benzema finds space, drifting free, was something to see; the ease with which Modric found him was too, a gentle, angled pass providing the Frenchman with another opportunity. This time it was a thump, Rui Silva pushing over just before half-time. But by then Granada, who had lost their way, left chasing butterflies, had found it again. Domingos Duarte drew a sharp save from Thibaut Courtois \u2013 a reminder of the goalkeeper\u2019s huge contribution to this incoming title and that there might still be life in this game. Early in the second half, there really was. Casmeiro was caught in the centre and Yangel Herrera led the charge, slipping the ball into Mach\u00eds. From virtually the same place that the first two goals had been scored, he drove it between Courtois\u2019s legs and the place erupted as much as any place with barely 200 people in it can. This was different now, Mach\u00eds guiding a half volley past the post then almost reaching Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s filtered pass. It sounded different, too: louder, more tense, protests accompanying the play where before there were none, even the ball hit harder now, less no room for subtlety. Duarte carried from deep all the way to the edge of the Madrid area where he was brought down. When the scene was repeated not long after, \u00c1ngel Montoro complained to the referee: \u201cYou could hear the bloody clash.\u201d He was right, too. the pace quickened, the pitch tilted towards Madrid\u2019s goal. There was a scramble in the six-yard box, Germ\u00e1n falling in the crowd. Still Granada came. Antonio Anton\u00edn controlled on his chest and hit an acrobatic volley that Courtois saved, diving full length. The ball came back in and reached Ramon Azeez, whose shot was cleared off the line by Ramos. \u201cBravo! Bravo!\u201d Mart\u00ednez shouted, applause intensifying as it echoed round, everything accelerating. Montoro\u2019s late header drifted over and then Rui Silva went up for a corner, only to watch it fly over his head. Madrid hung on, not least because they had something to hang on to \u2013 a league title that they surely won\u2019t let go of now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
