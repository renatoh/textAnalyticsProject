Ask Emile Heskey. Like goalkeepers, as Robert Green knows, they are at the business end of the pitch. Adam Le Fondre carries on hitting for Rotherham United. He is League Two's top scorer, with seven in seven games. It took him 89 minutes against Barnet and then it was a tap-in as Jake Cole failed to hold Kevin Ellison's shot. But that is what strikers do. He is well named. Fondre is to pounce in French. The goal, Rotherham's fourth, relaxed his manager, Ronnie Moore. The previous week they had led Burton Albion 3-0 and drawn 3-3. Barnet, quick to hit back through Mark Byrne after conceding three in eight minutes that defied the flow of play, were pressing. \"Here we go again,\" thought Moore, as he admitted afterwards. In added time Le Fondre might have had another, Cole saving with his feet. This was still a crazy scoreline. Rotherham, in Manchester City blue, tapped the ball about for 20 commanding minutes before Barnet rushed them out of their stride and ruled for 45. Mark Marshall, twice clear, wasted both and, when crossing dangerously, saw Ricky Holmes lunge and miss. Jordan Parkes fizzed two long shots past the far post before Andy Warrington's reflexes denied Phil Walsh. Then Le Fondre, burrowing too close to goal for Barnet's comfort, won a corner that Ellison forced home after Ryan Cresswell's header hit the bar; and two byline crosses from Nicky Law on the right set up Tom Pope and Danny Harrison for 3-0. \"Lucky bastards comes to mind\" were Moore's first sheepish words later. \"Up to 65 minutes anyone watching would think, if we get one goal, we'll go on and win,\" said Mark Stimson, his opposite number, after Barnet had sunk to the foot of the table. \"Every day we have shooting practice. We've just got to bring it to the game\" \u2013 which is what Le Fondre does. \"It's nice to have different people getting goals,\" said Moore. \"It takes pressure off Alf [nickname],\" to which end he is also courting a loan striker from Manchester City. Le Fondre agreed: \"It's good for me when others are scoring.\" Last season, helped by 10 penalties, he got 25 of the 55 league goals and two more in the play-off semi-finals before Rotherham lost to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge at Wembley. When he arrived from Rochdale in August 2009 he saw \"a progressive club with high ambitions\". In his absence Rochdale went up. Undismayed, he is seeking to extend a contract that was three years. \"I'd like to play in the Championship and to do it with Rotherham,\" he says. Moore took them there before from the fourth tier. The ladders of football's pyramid are crowded with players chasing dreams. Le Fondre will encourage them as England's very latest selections have. With a will and skill it is possible to climb the rungs. He is 23, born of a mother whose father was French, and he wanted to be a footballer from five. From 10 to 16 he was at Stockport's School of Excellence, when they knew a bit of excellence. His heroes were Eric Cantona and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. At 5ft 9in he more resembles Kevin Phillips. Here he was partnered by Paul Warne, a fitness phenomenon of 37 \u2013 not what one associates with the surname \u2013 then Pope who, at 6ft 3in, was more able to play the Niall Quinn foil. Orange heels to grey boots seemed like a signal to go and he went in a flash that Barnet watched warily and well. He is confident but not cocky. Moore, returning to the club where he is folk hero as player and manager, could hardly believe his luck in finding the striker just arrived. \"He has a gift from the Gods. He's deadly in the box, brave too, and we're working to improve his movement off the ball. He's a great personality, though the others rib him for being greedy.\" A former Pope, John Paul II, would have seen nothing wrong in that. He was a goalkeeper. Rotherham fended off inquiries from Derby and Leicester last month. \"Something like \u00a3850,000 with add-ons to \u00a31.5m might make the chairman think,\" said Moore, but the club have stabilised under Tony Stewart and should be back in town, near Millmoor, by 2012 instead of at Sheffield's Don Valley Stadium, where they attract gates of about 3,500. That is time enough for Le Fondre to fulfil his Championship wish and join his manager as a local legend, along with the Chuckle Brothers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
