Anastasiades, leader of the conservative Democratic Rally (Disy) party, came in first with 35.50% of the vote but fell short of the 50% required to win outright. In a repeat of the island\u2019s last presidential election, he now faces Malas, who ran as an independent with the support of the Progressive Party of Working People (Akel). The geneticist won 30.35%, sparking scenes of jubilation among supporters. The Diko party leader, Nikolas Papadopoulos, whose nationalist views are seen as anathema by ethnic Greeks still hoping to unite war-divided Cyprus, trailed with 25.74%. \u201cI know a lot of friends feel bitter and disappointed, so do I,\u201d he said once the results were announced. His failure to make it into the second round was greeted with relief by voters desperate to bridge the divide with their Turkish Cypriot compatriots. The European Union\u2019s most easterly member state, Cyprus has been partitioned since a rightwing coup for union with Greece prompted Turkey to invade in 1974. \u201cTwo-thirds of Greek Cypriots went for candidates who openly support a federal settlement,\u201d said the bi-communal lobby group Unite Cyprus Now. Anastasiades, 71, campaigned for re-election promising to re-energise the stalled peace process. UN-mediated talks aimed at uniting Cypriots in a bizonal federation collapsed amid anger and mutual recrimination last July but still came closer than ever before to success. Akel also backs rapprochement with Turkish Cypriots living on the other side of a UN-patrolled \u201cgreen line\u201d in the island\u2019s north. \u201cThe people have spoken,\u201d said Malas. \u201cWe turn a new page looking to the future with optimism, confidence and determination,\u201d he added, before congratulating Turkish Cypriots for marching in favour of peace and democracy after Turkish nationalists attacked a pro-reunification newspaper, Afrika, last week. The electoral outcome unleashes a week of political horsetrading. The far-right Elam party, which emerged in fourth place with 5.56%, said it would send a questionnaire to both candidates before deciding who it would endorse in the second round. The ultra-nationalists have close links to the neo-fascist Golden Dawn, Greece\u2019s fourth-largest political force. Revelling in the party\u2019s success, its leader, Christos Christou, said: \u201cThey should be sure that no one will ever be able to mock the patriotic front.\u201d Nine candidates competed in the all-male race for the five-year presidency. After a lacklustre campaign where the national issue took second place to the economy, voter apathy also emerged victorious with only 395,915 voters casting ballots. More than 550,000 citizens were eligible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
