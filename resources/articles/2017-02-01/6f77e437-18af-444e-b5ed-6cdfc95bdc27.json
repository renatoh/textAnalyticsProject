It will be an unlikely location to stoke one of international football\u2019s great rivalries, but the two sides currently hold the top two rankings places, and there is always degree of feeling between them. At full strength, Argentina\u2019s side would contain a host of superstars, with Messi joined by the likes of Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain, Javier Mascherano and Angel Di Maria. Brazil\u2019s best side would feature Messi\u2019s Barcelona team-mate Neymar, plus Philippe Coutinho, Oscar and Dani Alves. At full strength, the two sides would go close to matching the 95,446-strong crowd drawn by Liverpool for their 2013 MCG friendly against Melbourne Victory. The main sticking point will be the availability or otherwise of Messi and Neymar, two of the biggest names in the game, but on Friday one events company offering tickets claimed the involvement of Messi and Neymar was guaranteed. For previous goodwill and exhibition tours of Australia, larger club sides have tended to leave big-name players at home, primarily on account of the effects of the long-haul flight to Australia. Tournament organisers have not yet guaranteed the availability of the superstar duo. It would be Messi\u2019s first match in Australia since he piloted Argentina\u2019s 1-0 defeat of Australia in 2007. \u201cWe will have the best two teams clashing here at the MCG,\u201d Victorian sports minister John Eren said on Friday. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a blockbuster. It\u2019s going to be a sell-out.\u201d \u201cThere is 100 years of rivalry between Argentina and Brazil. These matches are always special,\u201d Argentina coach Edgardo Bauza said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to meeting in Melbourne. Our priority is to prepare for the important World Cup qualifiers coming up in 2017 and this match and the camp will be extremely valuable.\u201d In December 2016 the Australian revealed that one of the two touring sides was likely to stay on for a warm-up match against Australia before the Socceroos jet off to the Confederations Cup. The SuperClasico de las Americas was created in 2011 as a two-game home-and-away series, but the format was altered in 2014 to a one-off match played at a neutral venue \u2013 the first of which was Beijing that year. The format has been dormant since, and the Melbourne game would be the first in three years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
