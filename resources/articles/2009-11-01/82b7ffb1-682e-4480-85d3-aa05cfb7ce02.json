That outlay is intended to reinvigorate England's faltering bid to host the tournament in 2018. The former captain of the national team guarantees glamour that has been lacking so far in the campaign. Beckham, who misses tomorrow's friendly against Brazil because of club commitments at LA Galaxy, is intended to restore impetus to the FA's flagging bid. Transport and security arrangements for the 34-year-old are costly but it will still look like a minor outlay in the effort to see England stage the World Cup for a second time. \"He's a phenomenal asset,\" said Lord Triesman, chairman of the FA and of the bid itself. \"We want him there the maximum amount of time, we want him to be safe when he's there and to do as much with us as we can get him to do. Thank goodness he's totally up for it.\" Confirmation of Beckham's participation was announced the day after Triesman had restructured the board for the 2018 bid from 12 members to seven. The chairman insists on the continuing relevance of those who have now gone. Triesman highlighted the part that the Manchester United chief executive, David Gill, can still play. Gill has stepped aside from the board to form part of an advisory council. \"There are people,\" he said, \"who are absolutely critical to us like David, who is going to Kuala Lumpur on behalf of the bid in a few weeks' time. \"Nobody's been bumped off. The small group is going to do it day by day to ensure we have a focus. David will continue to use all his experience as one of the leading football administrators in the world.\" For all that, there is no concealing the fact that doubts have been raised about Triesman now that the original strategy has had to be overhauled. He promised a measure of self-analysis following criticism of the bid. \"It's not all pleasant,\" he said, \"but it's made us think.\" There was a note of defiance from Triesman. \"I am going to do my level best to prove people wrong,\" he said. His predecessor at the FA, Geoff Thompson, who is a vice-president of Fifa and Uefa, is now on the board. \"He's a huge asset,\" said Triesman. The chairman did not deny tensions with various parties. \"Certainly we have had our arguments,\" Triesman said, but he is adamant that the reaction to the World Cup bid is favourable. \"We've got huge assets,\" he said. \"I think I've seen every member of the Fifa executive committee \u2013 we are getting a very serious response. We are not getting rebuffed around the world. It's winnable and I am very, very determined that we should win it.\" He added: \"I am increasingly confident that we will do well in the first vote.\" Triesman rejected suggestions that he ought to resign his leadership of the bid since he sees it as an essential part of the office of FA chairman in which he intends to remain. His resolve to continue is not in doubt, although Triesman is aware of the resources being put behind rival bids and seems frustrated by a government of which he was once a member. \"I don't thinks it's being proposed in equity terms but in loan terms,\" he said of the funding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
