Image: Dan Logen, 1 February 2011 [velociraptorize]. Nikon D300s, 600 mm lens with 1.4 extender, ISO 800, f/8, 1/1250 sec. Question: This lovely African songbird is an Ethiopian endemic -- it is found nowhere else in the world. Can you tell me the name of its taxonomic family? Can you identify the species? Response: This is adult male black-headed siskin, Serinus nigriceps. This Ethiopian endemic is distinct from all other species in the area, so it's not easy to confuse with anything else. It is currently a member of Fringillidae (true finches), although the taxonomy of this family and genus needs a lot of work.
