No breathless outbreaks of discussion and frenzied internet activity ever follow Showtime's original programming. No one ever praises the channel as the embodiment of quality television. But does that rankle the bosses of the cable station chiefly known for not being HBO? Oh yes, it rankles. Showtime has unleashed a welter of made-for-cable movies and an even bigger welter of TV series - I've written about some of them here: Dead Like Me, Street Time, The L Word - and garnered zip in terms of noticeably increased ratings, appreciative reviews and, most crucially, respect from peers come awards season. Even the projects that attracted loyal audiences - the US Queer As Folk and the series spun off from the movie Soul Food - barely made the impact of a Deadwood, let alone a Sopranos or a Six Feet Under. So this month Showtime is making a concerted effort to create the perception that it's a worthy competitor in the appointment television arena that HBO had staked out as its own private property. Up until now, Showtime has never had a signature show capable of going up against HBO's winning hand. All that changed with the advent of Huff. Showtime has so much confidence in Huff's audience-and-award-attracting ability that it's made a big splashy deal of commissioning season two weeks before season one had aired. Does Huff live up to such a show of faith? Depends on how you feel about the genre of drama filed under \"Rich Guilty White Guy Struggling With Mid-Life Crisis\". Actually, forget the bit about struggling. Dr Craig Huffstodt (perennial character actor Hank Azaria finally snagging the spotlight) is a prosperous psychiatrist with a loving family and a huge sprawling home. Then a teenage patient who'd followed Huff's advice and come out to his parents with calamitous results puts a gun in his mouth and sprays his brains all over the doc's tastefully decorated office. \"I've been asleep for the past 42 years,\" realises the shocked shrink. In the wake of the boy's suicide, Huff re-evaluates his life and decides to ... stare. A lot. He stares at his loving wife as she goes toe-to-toe with his bracingly callous wasp mother (Blythe Danner), his drippily sensitive son, his institutionalised schizophrenic brother and his substance-guzzling, whore-mongering fat freak buddy (Oliver Platt, who's played variations of this role so many times, his character may as well be called Oliver Platt). A show with a tagline that reads: \"Life. Sometimes you wake up in the middle of it\" and starts with an earth-shattering epiphany kind of leads the casual viewer to expect the titular character to respond in an equally earth-shattering manner. But Huff doesn't jack in the shrink racket to become a vigilante. He mostly just stares. The only wrinkle the suicide seems to put in Huff's routine is the introduction of a homeless Hungarian, who keeps hitting the shrink up for donations so he can rebuild his musical career and who may or may not be a figment of his imagination. You know, a lot like the idea that two seasons of Huff could add a little sparkle to the empty display cases at Showtime ... A few months back, the TV industry was shaken to its core by the sneaky spoiler tactics employed by the Fox network. It beat Mark Burnett's boxing reality show The Contender onto the air with The Next Great Champ and launched Trading Spouses while ABC was still shooting its version of Wife Swap. But Next Great Champ was quickly cancelled and Trading Spouses acted as a trailer for Wife Swap, which became a much bigger hit. The reinvigorated ABC probably doesn't have to worry about Fox spoiling the national appetite for its version of Supernanny with the hastily thrown together Nanny 911, which seems to employ as many sweet-natured Australian au pairs as it does strict British governesses. Just goes to show, cheats never prosper (which is a great title for a TV show. Just watch Fox steal it ...)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
