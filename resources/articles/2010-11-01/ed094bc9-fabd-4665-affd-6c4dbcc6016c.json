Editorially, we are in difficult territory. Liszt rewrote many of them, drastically simplifying them in the process. But in musico-dramatic terms, the originals are often vastly preferable to the revisions, and tenor Matthew Polenzani and pianist Julius Drake opt for the first versions of the Petrarch Sonnets and the Lieder aus Schiller's Wilhelm Tell interwoven with shorter pieces, familiar or otherwise. Most of Liszt's songs are big statements, usually described as virtuoso. But as with so much of his music, their difficulty in performance is to be found in their emotional and expressive extremes. The challenges are more than met here, with Polenzani doing things in songs such as Der Fischerknabe or Pace Non Trovo that you never thought were possible for a human voice, while Drake's intensity is total and unswerving."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
