His club were deemed to have descended into \"crisis\" after the resignation of their executive chairman, Nicola Cortese, last week and those looking in from the outside are still busy speculating about Mauricio Pochettino's medium-term future as manager. According to Cork, though, the view from the dressing room is very different. \"Funnily enough the last few days have been much the same as other weeks, even though there was all that talk of meltdown and such,\" said the midfielder. \"It has never felt like meltdown. We go in and train and play football like we always do. \"We were laughing at talk of us imploding. That was never going to happen. There's been a lot of silly talk. The gaffer came in and said: 'I'm not going anywhere. We carry on.' That was nice to hear. Mr Cortese was a good chairman but I don't think it's really going to affect any of us lads.\" Or at least it might not if Pochettino remains in charge next season. The Argentinian has done a brilliant job at St Mary's and his side proved so irresistible in the first half that Sunderland could barely get hold of the ball. When Fabio Borini, a rare bright spark for Gus Poyet, scored from their first attack, the words freaky and flukey came instantly to mind. Eventually Poyet's game-changing second-half introduction of Jack Colback and Craig Gardner in central midfield heralded the radical improvement which prefaced Adam Johnson's equaliser. Nonetheless, had it not been for a few near misses and some outstanding saves by the excellent Vito Mannone Southampton would have had a comfortable lead well before the hour mark. An amalgam of high-calibre pressing and high-quality passing and movement, their style is extremely easy on the eye. \"The manager just gives us the confidence to play that kind of football,\" said Cork. \"It's accepted that every now and then we're going to make mistakes. He doesn't mind because we're playing nice football and the more we do that the better we get. There's definitely no blame culture; criticism is always constructive, not personal. \"Hopefully this mission we are on keeps going. It's vital Mauricio Pochettino stays next season and we keep this thing going. He's been fantastic for us. He talks to us every day and gives us the confidence to play.\" On far too many occasions Poyet's words have fallen on deaf ears but Saturday's half-time homily evidently got through. \"I'd prefer not to comment on what I said,\" pointed out a manager whose shambolic side had fallen behind to two volleys, from Jay Rodriguez and then Dejan Lovren. \"If we go to Manchester United on Wednesday [for the League Cup semi-final second leg] and play like we did for the first 30 minutes we're out for sure. Nothing was right. Nothing worked, no system, no organisation. Everything was wrong. Then Fabio scored.\" With Mannone, Colback, Gardner and the renascent Johnson subsequently doing their stuff, Poyet's day was, semi-miraculously, saved. Unfortunately Southampton's afternoon ended on a painful note featuring ankle damage, stretchers, leg braces, oxygen and x-rays as Lovren and Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edres were carried off late in the game. Lovren collided with Gardner but Ram\u00edres was the victim of an unpunished but contentious tackle from Wes Brown. The team's flight home on Saturday evening was delayed until Ram\u00edres's release from hospital, but the prognosis is slightly more optimistic than was first feared. Pochettino must wait until the swelling reduces before ankles can be scanned and specialists consulted but the early suspicion is that the pair have varying degrees of ligament damage, with Ram\u00edres also possibly nursing a hairline fracture.
