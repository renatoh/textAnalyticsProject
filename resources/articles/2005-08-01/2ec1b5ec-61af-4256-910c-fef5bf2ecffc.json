Pump prices have risen over the past year to a record this week of 90.2p a litre on average for unleaded and to 93.9p for diesel, although both are likely to rise again after the latest oil price rises, which feed through to the pumps after a delay of up to a month. In January last year, before the run-up that has seen crude prices more than double, unleaded at the pumps was only 73.9p, although even that was the dearest in Europe. Since crude prices began to rise, the Treasury has scrapped planned increases in fuel duty, which makes up about three-quarters of the price of a litre, thereby softening the blow. The government is wary of provoking motorists' anger since blockades of refineries nearly brought the country to a halt in September 2000, forcing the government to abandon a planned petrol duty rise. It had already stepped off the so-called \"escalator\" which increased petrol duty by six percentage points over inflation each year. That had helped push petrol above 80p a litre in the summer of 2000, a level that now seems quite cheap. But the overall cost of motoring has fallen as a share of the average family income. New car prices have dropped more than 10% in the past four years while the road tax on small cars has been reduced to promote their use. The gap between petrol and diesel prices has widened because the growth in popularity of diesel cars has caused problems for refiners who have been used to trying to extract the maximum amount of petrol from a barrel of oil. Refiners produce about 70% petrol from a barrel of oil - the rest being diesel, airline fuel and the building block for plastics - whereas 44% of new cars sold now are diesels, meaning there is not enough diesel to go round. Ashley Seager Aviation Surging fuel costs have forced a number of carriers to impose surcharges on ticket prices to help cover the rise. British Airways, for example, reckons its fuel bill for the current financial year will rocket from just over \u00a31.1bn to more than \u00a31.6bn. In response, BA, which began imposing fuel surcharges in May last year - and then only for long-haul flights - now charges \u00a38 on short-haul trips and \u00a324 on long-haul journeys. Rivals including Lufthansa and Air France have adopted a similar policy. The German flag carrier now charges customers \u20ac37 (\u00a325.61) on long-haul trips and \u20ac9 on flights within Europe. Air France charges \u20ac17 on European flights and up to \u20ac35 on longhaul destinations. Some carriers are not showing higher charges as surcharges but others argue they provide greater transparency by telling customers what they are being asked to pay in relation to higher fuel costs. Mark Milner Gas and electricity British consumers, already reeling from fuel bills which have risen around a fifth over the past 18 months, are now facing another round of price increases. Two companies, Powergen and EDF, have announced higher prices for gas and electricity and with prices in the wholesale markets up by 50% since the beginning of the year other companies are expected to follow suit. Retail gas prices had already risen by 21% since the beginning of 2004 and electricity bills were up by more than 17% before the latest increases, according to consumer watchdog Energywatch. One reason for the rise in prices is Britain's increasing reliance on imports of gas from continental Europe as Britain's North Sea reserves produce less of the country's needs. European gas prices tend to be linked to the price of oil but that link is coming under increasing scrutiny. A spokesman for Ofgem, Britain's energy market regulator, said it was supporting measures to introduce more effective competition in the European market. Ofgem is also concerned that rising bills will force more people into fuel poverty - spending more than 10% of their income on fuel bills. One other factor which is being blamed for rising prices is the European commission's carbon trading scheme under which companies are allowed set levels of carbon dioxide emissions and then pay for any excess. When EDF announced its electricity price increase it pointed to the impact of carbon trading on electricity from coal-fired generators. Mark Milner Shop prices The rising cost of oil has made life tough for retailers and logistics companies but consumers remain largely shielded from these effects by intense price competition. Retailers have seen electricity costs rise by as much as 50% compared with a year ago, according to the British Retail Consortium. But a slowdown in consumer spending has made competition even fiercer as shops battle to sell their goods. \"Costs have risen, but there's no way to pass it on to consumers with such fierce price competition,\"said a BRC spokeswoman, Dee Crooks. Logistics companies, including those who transport food around the country in refrigerated trucks, have seen the rising cost of fuel have an immediate impact on their costs. But these companies operate on fixed price contracts and so have to absorb these costs in their margins rather than pass them on to the supermarkets. Once again the consumer remains protected. The petrochemicals made from oil penetrate every corner of consumer society, from computers to plastic food packaging. As the price of oil has risen, so have these downstream chemicals, such as naphtha, which is used to make plastics.
