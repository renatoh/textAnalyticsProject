Sixty-five days to polling day and all the parties are wooing hard enough to make us bleed. Yesterday the PM himself was on Woman's Hour, partly to promote the family-friendly programme that Labour will be promising to implement should they be re-elected on May 5. Paid maternity leave will be extended from six to nine months, the statutory right to request flexible working from employers will be extended to parents of all children of school age and also to those who look after sick or disabled relatives. And, perhaps most interestingly, mothers will be given the right to hand over some of their entitlement to paid leave to the fathers of their kids. Things had, said Tony Blair, \"changed dramatically since I was a child. It [has become] far more part of the man's job as well as the woman's to look after the children.\" Hear, hear and all that, amid cynical noises from the Blair and Aaronovitch households, where the reality is not quite keeping pace with the rhetoric. But never mind the walk, for the moment, some people don't even talk the talk. Trade and industry secretary Patricia Hewitt was on the Today programme yesterday and was asked about the maternity/paternity proposals by a slightly incredulous Ed Stourton. Did she not realise, he asked, that some fathers might work for different employers? She had realised it. The implication behind the question was that it was somehow unfair for the employers of fathers to be expected to give dads time off just because their partners had had babies. As though some employers had effectively contracted for loss of baby time when hiring women, but that those who took on men had done so in the reasonable expectation of getting 25 solid, unbroken years out of them. Perhaps I'm being mean to Ed, but there is still some incomprehension out there. On the same programme a few months ago, I heard the Conservative front-bencher David Davis explain how his party would get rid of most of the civil service by natural wastage. This would include, he explained, the non-replacement of those who retired and of \"women going to have babies\". He hadn't quite caught up with social trends in the past decade or two, let alone the legislation that permits women to return to work after childbirth. The biggest objection to the government's proposals came, as ever, from \"small businesses\". David Frost, director of the British Chambers of Commerce, told the BBC News that all his members were \"being faced with a growing list of family-friendly policies which are clearly adding costs and making it more difficult to run a successful business in this country\". Especially at a time, he added, when they were being asked to deal with the competitive threat from China. Now, the government's proposals will actually be funded by the taxpayer (and quite right, too), but there may well be some cost to finding out that Bill, whose wife Jenny has given birth, has just decided to share the paid time off, half and half. But would this presumably fairly small expense really be sufficiently costly to stop us competing with the Chinese? If so, what other things mustn't we do for fear of losing out to the 1.3 billion inhabitants of that great country? When I was in Beijing last year I saw an alarming example of how elastic the Chinese conception of health and safety can sometimes be. On one of the great new highways I watched a street sweeper dodging speeding traffic to run his broom over the Tarmac. Anyone who has seen Chinese scaffolding will know the true meaning of the word \"precarious\". The Chinese peasant, come to work in the city, will toil for 12 hours a day, and is unlikely to demand childcare or paternity allowances. Nor will he be able to vote out a government that doesn't provide them. And, fair-dos, I am not sure that we can expect Mr Frost to compete with that. So let's not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
