He has written on the same subject on schmoller.net Being a virtual student used to mean skipping lectures after you'd signed up. Now, it's about attending lectures halfway across the world via the internet, replaying lecturers' best bits over a podcast and using online discussion groups to mull over questions. Being virtual can require much more work than anything that happens in a real lecture theatre. First, though, you need the right kit. This means persuading proud relatives, or the bank manager, that the following are essential if you are to leave university with a good enough degree to secure a five-figure salary: a lightweight, web enabled laptop with a good protective case that doesn't look like a laptop case; a small printer to attach to it, and a headset so that you can conduct free internet calls and therefore be in constant contact with home/your financial advisor. Oh, and it should have a good recent graphic card to that you can connect to Second Life - not for gaming of course but so that you can take part in virtual seminars as an avatar. If you've got them to agree to all these with ease, you can add: a PDA with a calendar to keep track of study timetables and deadlines, and a keyboard for text messages so that you can discuss the latest reading lists with your peers and take notes on field trips. It will also help you contact taxis late at night so that you aren't forced to accept a lift from whoever you've just met in the bar. And, of course, you will be using it to keep in contact with home when unable to phone or email. Parents/overdraft still got some financial slack? Then an MP3 player will allow you to listen to downloaded audio files of lectures and learning materials on the way to seminars. That way you need never waste a moment of potential study time. Naturally, you may also need to download the odd music track to help relieve pre-exam stress. If you are studying science or medicine you'll easily be able to make the case for an MP4 player to allow you to download revision videos while travelling and remind you of procedures on your first clinical placement. The next step, once you've collected all this hardware, is to find out what to do with it. Sign up in the library for every training session going, particularly those on how to conduct online searches. Typing a term into Google and hoping for something vaguely relevant is not going to get you to the kind of original research material that will impress your tutor. Nor is relying on Wikipedia. So find out from Google Help about such canny tricks as putting quotes around search items, learn how to search within a particular website, and use Google Scholar to search the scholarly literature. Intute, a free listing of high quality web resources for education and research, is worth a look, and don't forget to make use of all the add-ins available if you use Firefox as your browser. Don't feel you need to rely on your own university's virtual learning environment for course materials either. Check out the open educational resources website and you can have free access to lectures, lesson plans, homework assignments and videoed lectures from institutions all over the world. Virtually, you can be learning all about Game Theory from academics at MIT, while physically studying fashion at Leeds Met. If you find you've spent so long browsing that you've missed Freshers' Week but can't remember any more about it than those who overdid the first night cocktails, you'll need to start organising your time online. Create an account on a bookmarking service such as del.icio.us or Connotea so that you can bookmark stuff for future reference, sign up for RSS feeds, and install Google Reader so you'll be notified when new content is published on your chosen sites. And geeks don't have to be lonely. Collaborating through Facebook groups, wikis, Google groups, discussion forums and blogs are useful ways of practising online etiquette, although always beware plagiarism, which doesn't count as showing teamworking skills. Try seeing if you can get hold of the same plagiarism software as your university to check that you don't, completely by accident, submit someone else's essay instead of your own. Friendly as you find your online community, it is also worth remembering that you can also find things out from real people, real books, and sometimes even real lectures. \u00b7 This article was amended on Saturday October 25 2008 to acknowledge Seb Schmoller's contribution."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
