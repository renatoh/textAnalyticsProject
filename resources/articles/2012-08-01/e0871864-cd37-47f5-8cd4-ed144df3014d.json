The self-styled saviour of Radio 1, who will leave the biggest job in UK radio in September, saw his audience fall to 6.93 million in the three months to the end of June, according to the latest official Rajar listening figures published on Thursday. Moyles lost more than half a million listeners year on year, slipping below the seven million mark for the first time since the end of 2006, when he had an audience of 6.82m. BBC Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper announced the much-anticipated departure of Moyles from breakfast last month, although he is expected to move to another role at the station. He will be replaced by the station's late evening presenter, Nick Grimshaw, who at 27 is 11 years younger than Moyles. Cooper has come under pressure to retune the station to a younger audience. Moyles' imminent departure from breakfast is one of a number of changes instigated by Cooper, such as a clearout of many of its specialist DJs, including Gilles Peterson who has moved to BBC Radio 6 Music, and Greg James's move to drivetime in place of Scott Mills. Overall, Radio 1 had an average weekly reach of 11.27 million listeners in the three months to the end of June, up 1.2% on the previous quarter but down 3.6% year on year. It remains the second most popular station in the country, behind Radio 2 which had 14.46 million listeners, down 0.7% on the previous quarter but up 3.5% on last year. Radio 2 breakfast DJ Chris Evans remains by some distance the DJ most people choose to wake up to. Evans' audience of 8.95 million was down from 9.23 million the previous three months but up from 8.67 million in the second quarter of 2011. Moyles had long harboured hopes of presenting the nation's number-one breakfast show, particularly in the wake of Sir Terry Wogan's departure from the Radio 2 breakfast slot. The Radio 1 DJ steadily grew his breakfast audience from a debut of 5.93 million in 2004 to a high of 7.9 million at the beginning of 2010. But up against Wogan, and now Evans, whose lead is more than two million listeners, the number-one spot eluded him. Of the other BBC national stations, BBC Radio 4 was up 2.1% on the previous quarter but down 3.1% year on year to 10.52 million. Radio 4's flagship Today programme pulled in 6.76 million listeners. Its digital sister station BBC Radio 4 Extra added another 8.9% listeners on the previous quarter to a record 1.64 million and now has Radio 3, which had an audience of 2.04 million, in its sights. Not such good news for BBC Radio 5 Live, which was down 3.4% on the previous three months and down 6% year on year to 6.15 million. But its sister station, 5 Live Sports Extra, piled on the listeners, breaking through the one million barrier to 1.07 million. Among the BBC's other digital stations, BBC Radio 6 Music was down 5.2% on the previous three months but up 8.6% on the year to 1.38 million. BBC Radio 1 Xtra also had a record audience, up 24.1% on the previous quarter, to 1.14 million. But the BBC World Service suffered a big year on year drop in its UK audience, down 19.1% to 1.39 million, up 6.8% on the previous three months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
