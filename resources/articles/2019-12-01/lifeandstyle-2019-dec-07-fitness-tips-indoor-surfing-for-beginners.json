If you have those skill sets already it will help, but it\u2019s not going to make you a pro overnight. The boards are a lot smaller than conventional surfboards, and that\u2019s where the skill set changes. Don\u2019t move your upper body It\u2019s all about the balance of weight on your feet. If you put more weight on your backfoot you\u2019re going to travel upwards. If you put more weight on the front foot you\u2019re going to travel downwards. You really need to work hard to understand how to shift your weight. You will wipe out... ...and your friends will laugh. It doesn\u2019t matter how good you are \u2013 you\u2019re coming off the board. You\u2019re surfing a sheet wave of water about two inches thick, and the surface underneath is fairly similar to a trampoline. So when you take a tumble it\u2019s not going to hurt \u2013 but you will get very wet.
