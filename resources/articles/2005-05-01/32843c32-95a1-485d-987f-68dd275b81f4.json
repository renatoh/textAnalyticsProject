Ulrich Thomsen (from Festen) plays Michael, a career army officer about to be sent on a dangerous tour of duty in Afghanistan. He must first welcome the blackest of black sheep back to the family fold: his brother Jannik (Nicolaj Lie Kaas) has just been released from prison for assault. The action interestingly cuts between domestic drama on the home front and the war, and Bier has a strikingly real and powerful sequence showing an attack on a helicopter. You don't expect action-movie thrills in a Danish arthouse film - but you get them here anyway. It's all a little contrived, but Bier shows a refreshing interest in giving audiences the longed-for pleasure of an engrossing story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
