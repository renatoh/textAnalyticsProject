Read the full story on Trump and Kim\u2019s meeting here: Thanks for following along. Donald Trump has invited Kim Jong-un to visit the US during talks at Korean peninsula\u2019s demilitarised zone after he became the first American president to step onto North Korean soil. The meeting was organised yesterday, both leaders confirmed, after Trump tweeted Kim Jong-un suggesting they meet and \u201csay Hello(?)!\u201d while Trump was in the region for the G20 summit in Osaka. Trump travelled to the DMZ with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, while the three had an hour-long tri-lateral meeting at Peace House. Trump said the meeting was \u201cvery historic\u201d and criticised those who said that nothing had been come about from his two summits with Kim, which occurred last June and earlier this year. Trump announced that new teams would be set up by the three parties to the negotiations. Asked by journalists if he believed that North Korea\u2019s previous negotiators were still alive, he replied: \u201cI think so.\u201d Ivanka Trump had a slightly less glowing take than her father on the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea after she and her husband, Jared Kushner, stepped out of one of the blue houses alongside the demarcation line. \u201cHow was North Korea?\u201d she was asked by Margaret Talev from Bloomberg. \u201cSurreal\u201d answered the US president\u2019s daughter. With the dust settling on panmunjom, there\u2019s time now to pick up on some of the other subplots and details, in particular the cast-list of who else was present. According to Anna Fifield, Beijing bureau chief for the Washington Post, those on the sidelines for the handshake included: Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, the US conservative commentator and broadcaster Tucker Carlson, North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong Ho and his deputy Choe Song Hui, as well as the North Korean singer and Hyon Song Wol. After announcing that the sides would be setting up new teams to take forward negotiations, Trump was asked during the press conference if he believed that North Korea\u2019s previous negotiators were still alive. \u201cI think they are.. I know one of them is alive,\u201d he replied. Meanwhile, Trump talked up the fact that there has been no recent ballistic missile tests by North Korea. There had been some \u201cvery small ones\u201d - he added, but theres were missile tests which \u201cpractically every country does.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t consider that a test. We are talking about long range missile tests.\u201d Trump says that he invited Kim Jong-un to visit the US \u201cwhen the time is right.\u201d That bit of news - surely the cushions are being plumped up already in Mar-a-Lago - came towards the end of the short press conference he gave alongside the South Korean president. It looks like Trump also indicated that he was prepared to take up an invite to go to Pyongyang. Trump said that he had told Kim: \u201cYou know what? At the right time you are going to come over. We are going to to go over there. I would certainly extend the invite. Trump also said that it was he would suggested that he walk across the DMZ into North Korea. The US president asked Kim if he would like him to cross over and the reply was that he would be honoured. Moon maintained a poker face as Trump segued into a criticism of the previous White House administration \u201cIt was a fiery mess. Bad things were going on,\u201d added the president. After Moon spoke, Trump said that he wanted to thank Kim for saving him the media going after him if the North Korean leader had not taken up the Trump administration: \u201cHad he decided not to come you would have hit me, hit me hard. \u201cI want to thank him for doing it at such quick notice. We moved mountains.\u201d \u201cIn the meantime there has been no nuclear tests, there has been no nuclear missiles\u201d Trump addes that he\u2019s going to go off an speak with US troops now at a nearby military base. Trump is speaking to the press now alongside Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea. It\u2019s a mixture of his usual shots at the media for supposedly not reporting things accurately, and salvos at the Obama administration. If there\u2019s a hint at anything significant, it\u2019s that he says the three parties to the meeting have agreed that teams will be set up now - the US will have one under the auspices of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - \u201cto start working to see if they can do something.\u201d Trump began by saying \u201cNobody know show things turn out but certainly this was very legendary, a very historic day.\u201d \u201cIt will be even more historic if something comes up.\u201d The three leaders - Trump and the leaders of North and South Korea - have now emerged after more than an hour in talks. Here\u2019s a bit of snatched audio from that rather crowded encounter outside between Trump and Kim earlier, with a suggestion that the North Korean leader has invited his US counterpart to come and visit in the DPRK\u2019s capital Some more snippets from that bilateral meeting at the Freedom House between Trump and Kim, via the latest take from the White House press pool. Journalists were ushered into a \u201cchaotic bilat\u201d at the Freedom House, here Kim Jong Un and POTUS sat in front of the room, reports Seung Min Kim of the Washington Post Speaking through an interpreter, Kim talked of \u201cwilling to put an end to the unfortunate past.\u201d If not for the \u201cexcellent relations between the two of us\u201d this opportunity would not be possible, he added. Trump told the room: \u201cYou hear the power of that voice\u201d referring to Kim. Noted \u201che doesn\u2019t do news conferences.\u201d \u201cThus is a historic moment, the fact that we\u2019re meeting.\u201d He went on: \u201cYou made us both look good\u201d with this meeting. We\u2019ve developed a great relationship.\u201d The two leaders then shook hands and the press were ushered out. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog from Kate. Donald Trump has met with Kim Jong-un in the demilitarised zone and has become the first US president to step onto North Korean soil, after Kim invited Trump to step over the demarcation line into North Korean territory. The meeting was organised yesterday, both leaders confirmed, after Trump tweeted Kim Jong-un suggesting they meet and \u201csay Hello(?)!\u201d while Trump was in the region for the G20 summit in Osaka. Trump travelled to the DMZ with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, the three were expected to have a tri-lateral meeting at Peace House, but Trump and Kim appeared at a press conference without Moon, raising questions about how involved the South Korean leader would be in any discussions. Trump said the meeting was \u201cvery historic\u201d and criticised those who said that nothing had been come about from his two summits with Kim, which occurred last June and earlier this year. Trump said he would be willing to invite Kim to the White House \u201cright now\u201d Devastating analysis from Victor Cha, a professor at Georgetown University, who calls this \u201creality TV\u201d and \u201cfaked diplomacy\u201d that gives US, South Korea and North Korea \u201ctrivial domestic kudos while legitimizing the [human rights] abusing/nuke regime\u201d. There was a lot of jostling in the press pack as they attempted to cover the meeting. A female voice could be heard repeatedly saying \u201cPlease stop it, don\u2019t do that.\u201d Though it is unclear who that was, as she wasn\u2019t in shot, and if that event is connected to the alleged Grisham event reported by Jim Acosta from CNN. As well as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson was present in the White House pool. A reminder of that social media invitation from Trump : We have this pool report from a reporter on the ground with the president. At 3:44pm, POTUS walked out of Freedom House, together with President Moon, towards the military demarcation line between South and North Korea, located between the two famous blue huts. The North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, wearing his traditional Mao suit, was walking down the stairs towards him on the Northern side of the line. At 3:45pm, the two leaders shook hands over the concrete slab that forms the military demarcation line between South and North Korea. \u201cGood to see you again\u201d, said Kim in English, adding that he would have \u201cnever expected\u201d to see POTUS \u201cat this place\u201d. At 3:46pm, POTUS crossed the line, becoming the first sitting US president to step into North Korea. He then walked a few meters into the North together with Kim. \u201cGood progress, good progress\u201d, he said as the two leaders crossed back to the South. The two leaders are now holding a bilateral meeting in The Freedom House on the South Korean side. There is some discussion about the fact that this is supposed to be a tri-lateral meeting between Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in. All three leaders went into the building together, but only Kim and Trump fronted the cameras for that press conference. It is unclear whether Moon will join them for the rest of the meeting. Trump is speaking now. He comments on the fact that we are hearing from Kim directly. \u201cYou hear that voice, no one hears this voice, he doesn\u2019t do press conferences.\u201d Trump says he wants to thank Kim for responding to his Twitter invitation to meet. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t show up the press was going to make me look very bad,\u201d says Trump. \u201cIf you look back two-and-a-half years, before I was president, it was a very very bad situation, a very dangerous situation for North Korea, South Korea, for the world. The relationship we have developed has been so much for so many people,\u201d says Trump. \u201cThank you for asking me to step over that line, I didn\u2019t know if you were going to ask me to do that, I thought you might, but I was ready to do that if you asked.\u201d Trump calls the meeting \u201cvery historic\u201d. \u201cThe great relationship between President Trump and I, I don\u2019t think if we didn\u2019t have such a great relationship we could have organised this meeting in just a day. I would like to use this strong relationship to create more good news that nobody expects,\u201d says Kim. Kim confirms he heard from Trump yesterday afternoon and wanted to meet him again. \u201cI believe that meeting here, which is a symbol of division and a hostile past, I think meeting here, two countries that have a hostile past, we are showcasing to the world that we have a new present and we have a positive meeting going forward,\u201d says Kim. Trump and Kim are inside now, seated in front of a row of flags. Kim is speaking, will have the translation soon. Standing with Trump on the southern side of the DMZ, Kim said. \u201cPresident Trump just crossed became first US president to visit our country. This is an expression of his willingness to eliminate the aggression of the past and open a new future.\u201d Trump responded: \u201cThis is my honour. I didn\u2019t expect it. Stepping across that line was a great honour \u2013 a lot of progress has been made and this is a great friendship. It was short notice so I want to thank you,\u201d he said, gesturing to Kim. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go and talk for a while. A lot of positive things are happening \u2026 we met and we liked each other from day one. and that\u2019s very important.\u201d And the press conference has actually wrapped up this time and Trump and Kim are heading inside a building for discussions. Trump is still talking. \u201cWhen I became president of the US, there was great great conflict, now there is less conflict,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s my great honour and the Chairman\u2019s honour.\u201d \u2018Stepping across that line is a great honour,\u2019 says Trump Trump is speaking now, standing alongside Chairman Kim. \u201cI just want to say this is my honour,\u201d he says. \u201cStepping across that line is a great honour, great progress has been made, great friendships have been made and this has been, in particular, a great friendship.\u201d Trump has thanked Kim for being available to meet at such short notice, saying he called him up yesterday. \u201cWe met and we liked each other from day one, and that is very important.\u201d The press conference has finished up, Trump says he and Kim are going inside to talk for a little while. A reporter asks whether Kim will come to the US any time soon. \u201cI would invite him right now,\u201d Trump says. Donald Trump has crossed the demarcation line onto North Korean soil. This is huge, as Julian Borger writes: \u201cDonald Trump has become the first incumbent US president to cross, even if it turns out to be only a few inches, into North Korea. It has a particular symbolic importance to the Kim regime, and is a sign of the country\u2019s normalisation and status in the world as a power among world powers. Bill Clinton came close to visiting in his last couple of months in office, but decided against it, after it was clear in 2000 that George W Bush had been elected as his successor. Clinton felt he could not lock Bush into a peace process the latter would not support. \u201cJimmy Carter visited Kim\u2019s father Kim Il-sung in 1994 in pursuit of a diplomatic breakthrough, but he went as a former president.\u201d The US president has met with the North Korean leader in a hastily-arranged handshake meeting. Trump confirmed on Sunday that while the visit to the demilitarised zone has been scheduled for several months, he called up Kim yesterday to set up the brief meeting. Trump is in the region for the G20 meeting in Osaka. The meeting is just a greeting between the two leaders, and it is not expected that the two leaders will hold long talks today. Arirang News in South Korea is quoting sources as saying that Trump, Kim and Moon have already met at the DMZ. Though they also say: \u201cWe are also not really sure what is going on right now.\u201d It\u2019s a weird afternoon. We\u2019ll let you know as soon as we have confirmation of that meeting. So we are now just waiting for Donald Trump\u2019s handshake meeting with Kim Jong-un, which Trump said would happen in four minutes (roughly 10 minutes ago). Confirmation that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are in the DMZ with the president. Trump is greeting military personnel. This event is taking place at a base in the DMZ. He is now signing the wall of the base, in keeping with tradition. \u201cYesterday, I had the idea, maybe I\u2019ll call Chairman Kim\u2026We respect each other, might even like each other,\u201d Trump told the gathered military personnel and press. Trump has been presented with a golf shirt and cap with his name on it from a US military leader, in appreciation of his work for peace in the region. Donald Trump says this visit was organised several months ago when he told Moon he would like to visit the DMZ. But says that the meeting with Kim Jong-un was only organised yesterday. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t give him much notice,\u201d he says. He says the meeting with Kim will take place in about four minutes, so he needs to cut his remarks short. President Moon says we will witness an even more momentous event today. He says these great changes, from the DMZ being a place of hostility to peace is due to President Trump, whom he praises as \u201cthe president of all of you\u201d. President Moon Jae-in is speaking now in a meeting with Donald Trump and military personnel. The South Korean president thanks the personnel for keeping Korea safe and says this is a historic meeting, the first time that the US president and South Korean president have ever been in the DMZ together. Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior aide, is also in the DMZ and has signalled her willingness to cross into North Korea if invited. Interesting analysis from Frank Jannuzi, formerly of the state department, in response to Trump\u2019s comment that \u201call of the danger went away\u201d after the first summit between the two leaders last June. \u2018After our first summit all of the danger went away,\u2019 Trump addresses press in DMZ \u201cIt used to be dangerous, very, very dangerous. After our first summit all of the danger went away,\u201d Trump said, while addressing press in the DMZ. Trump criticised the press for their coverage of his summits with Kim Jong-un, particularly the most recent summit in Hanoi, which ended suddenly without an agreement. \u201cThey have no appreciation for what we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say to people who say nothing has been accomplished, so much was accomplished,\u201d he said. Trump was told that around 25 million people, including 10 million in the Seoul greater metropolitan area, are within range of North Korean artillery along the northern side of the DMZ. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like that anywhere, in terms of danger,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut it\u2019s all working out,\u201d he added in a reference to his dialogue with Kim Jong-un. \u201cIt always works out.\u201d While at the observation post, Trump\u2019s military minder pointed out the Kaesong industrial complex, a joint North-South venture where tens of thousands of North Korean workers made products, including clothes and watches, for more than 100 South Korean companies. The complex\u2019s fate has always been closely linked to the health of cross-border ties. It was closed by South Korea\u2019s conservative government in 2016 in protest at North Korean nuclear test and missile launches. Seoul said profits from Kaesong were funding Pyongyang\u2019s military programmes. The current South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, a liberal, would like to reopen Kaesong to encourage the North to make nuclear concessions, but restarting the complex is complicated by international economic sanctions against the regime in Pyongyang. It\u2019s unclear where Trump is going now and when and where he will be meeting with Kim Jong-un. Trump is speaking to press. He says that much has been accomplished in improving the North Korean and US relationship due to his meetings with Kim Jong-un. \u201cI would say to people who say nothing has been accomplished, so much was accomplished,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all working out, it always works out.\u201d And Trump has left the observation tower. A reminder that this issue has been a key branding point for Donald Trump who hails his meetings with Kim Jong-un (particularly the first meeting in Singapore last year) as one of the great achievements of his presidency. Footage from that meeting has featured in many of the video packages produced by the president\u2019s team, that resemble movie trailers, selling Trump\u2019s achievements. Looks like we might expect today\u2019s meeting to feature in the next video. Is this meeting significant? At a press conference an hour and a half ago South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in said the meeting represented a \u201cbig hope to everyone\u201d. Speaking alongside Trump at the start of their bilateral talks, Moon said even a handshake and brief encounter between Trump and Kim \u201cwould be a significant milestone in the peace process on the Korean peninsula\u201d. Moon, who has travelled with Trump to the DMZ, added that he could \u201creally feel that the flower of peace was truly blossoming on the Korean peninsula.\u201d He later told a joint press conference that he was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d with emotion about the meeting at the border village of Panmunjom. He described Trump and Kim as \u201cso brave\u201d adding, \u201cI hope President Trump will go down in history as the president who achieves peace on Korean peninsula.\u201d This is the third time the two leaders have met. The first was in Singapore last June. They met again in February this year in Hanoi, but the meeting ended abruptly without progress. Associated Press is saying that the meeting between the two leaders is not as impromptu as it has been presented. From AP: \u201cDespite Trump\u2019s comments Saturday, he had told The Hill newspaper in Washington in an interview this past week that he would be visiting the DMZ and \u201cmight\u201d meet with Kim. The paper reported it had withheld Trump\u2019s comments, citing security concerns by the White House.\u201d Trump is flanked by a large number of aides and military personnel and South Korean president Moon Jae-in. He is currently looking out over the DMZ from a bunker and being shown the landscape. Donald Tump has arrived in the DMZ for this fairly impromptu meeting with the chairman of North Korea. They are expected to shake hands and say hello, but not have any full-length talks. The president\u2019s motorcade is pulling up now. The live-stream embedded at the top of the Guardian\u2019s liveblog is making for some interesting listening at the moment. Reporters are preparing to get footage of the president\u2019s arrival and greeting of the North Korean leader. However, they are being given strict instructions about what they are and are not allowed to film and photograph. \u201cThe boundary is the tower, do not film anything past that tower,\u201d a minder\u2019s voice is heard saying in English. This is Kate Lyons taking over from Alison Rourke. CNN reports that Trump has landed in the demilitarised zone and will meet with Kong Jong-un shortly. Donald Trump first suggested the meeting with Kim in a tweet at the G20 meeting in Japan yesterday morning, in which he said he\u2019d like to \u201csay Hello(?)!)\u201c. During meetings in Seoul today he said that a handshake with Kim would \u201cmean a lot\u201d. The meeting between the two leaders was only confirmed in the past hour or so when Trump and South Korea\u2019s president Moon Jae-in, held a joint press conference. You can read our full story on that here. More images are coming in of Trump\u2019s helicopters arriving at the DMZ. Donald Trump has travelled to the so-called \u201cpeace village\u201d of Panmunjom, the site of the demarcation line between the two Koreas when their war finished in 1953. Helicopters have been arriving at the site in the past two minutes. Hello and welcome to this live blog for the highly anticipated meeting between President Trump and North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un. The two men are expected to shake hands at the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea, possibly in the next hour. There is also the possibility that Donald Trump may step over the border and in to the north, something he said yesterday he would be happy to do. Trump will be accompanied by South Korea\u2019s president Moon Jae-in.
