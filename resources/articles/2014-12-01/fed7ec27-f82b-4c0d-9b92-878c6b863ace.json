With a short picking season, and what can be a delicate, easily spoiled crop, cherries are usually expensive. A large bowl as a centre piece of the Christmas table, is decadent. That juicy bite into the red flesh of a cherry is one of the joys of summer. The crack of the skin, the drip of sweet juice down your hand or chin. Despite their expense they should be enjoyed. They\u2019re at their best in Australia in December, though later varieties, and the Tasmanian cherries are available through January and early February. An ancient cultivated fleshy stone fruit, they can spoil easily, so refrigerate after purchase and if it\u2019s one of those oppressively hot days taking a cool bag to the market can assure your cherries remain plump and delicious. Look for cherries that are firm of flesh and smell good. The recipe we\u2019ve given is a beautiful way to preserve a fruit that is available for such a short time, and a jar of maraschino cherries makes a pretty Christmas present for someone who is interested in fine food. This recipe is a far cry from the maraschino cherries of the fifties and sixties, the cherries preserved in brine and bleached, then dyed an intense artificial red. These maraschino cherries were used for cocktails, as well as adorning kitsch dishes like baked ham and ice cream sundays. They tasted nothing like a cherry. Maraschino is a Croatian liquor made from the distillation of the Marasca cherry \u2013 a sour cherry. (There are two main types of cherries, the sweet which is what is mostly cultivated here in Australia, and the sour cherries which are used predominately in cooking and are very common in Europe.) The maraschino cherry was originally preserved in this liquor, hence its name, but underwent an evolution that left even the process of preserving in liquor behind. We\u2019ve preserved our cherries in brandy, with aromatics that bring out the flavour of the cherry, rather than mask it with sweetness. We used our preserved cherries in a Manhattan cocktail, perfect for a balmy summer evening. Maraschino cherries 100g castor sugar A pinch of sea salt 100ml water A strip of orange rind, with no pith (20cm long) A quill of cinnamon 300g of cherries One cup of brandy Put sugar, water, salt, rind, cinnamon into a small saucepan and simmer until the sugar dissolves. Take off the heat, add the brandy and cherries. Place in a sterilized jar. Let it come to room temperature before placing in the refrigerator. You can keep them for a good while in the refrigerator, but they\u2019re so delicious, they won\u2019t last long. Makes 400ml of cherries in their liquid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
