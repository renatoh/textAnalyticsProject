That little sketch \u2013 \u201cD\u2019ya want some cheese?\u201d \u2013 comes to mind now Felix Magath has left Fulham and one of the stories that suggests he, too, had some strange ideas of his own before everything unravelled. Again, it involves a large mound of cheese and, much like Alan, it is difficult to know where it leaves him professionally. It goes back to last season when Brede Hangeland, then the Fulham captain, was diagnosed with a slight thigh injury and the club\u2019s doctor, Stephen Lewis, with more than a decade of working in elite sport, put together a recovery programme to try to get him fit for the weekend. Except Magath thought he knew better. There was another way to treat the problem, he said. So he sent the kit-man to the Tesco in New Malden, a short drive along the A3 from Fulham\u2019s training ground, to buy a large block of cheese. Hangeland was then told to perch on the end of a massage table and spend the afternoon in that position with a slab of cheese carefully positioned on the sore spot. The cheese, according to Magath, would have soothing effects. Hangeland was a sceptical patient and, funnily enough, Lewis decided a few months later he would rather stick to more orthodox practices and left to join Brighton and Hove Albion. Hangeland could not wait to get away either and has been a frequent critic of Magath ever since. Others, I suspect, will start to be more forthcoming now he is gone because it is clear, speaking to some of the people who have now left Fulham, that his regime was even more bewildering and unpleasant than previously thought. It is certainly difficult sometimes to remember that the man Fulham sacked on Thursday, bottom of the Championship and dropping like a stone in a well, had won two Bundesliga titles with Bayern Munich and another with Wolfsburg in the previous decade. The Strange Case of the (Craven) Cottage Cheese is one thing but the stories about Magath are multiple and it would not be any surprise here if Fulham, despite losing their first game with Kit Symons as caretaker manager, begin climbing the league once a bit of common sense returns to the club and now they have started to bring back some of the ostracised players. The list of outcasts featured Bryan Ruiz, who you may recall featured in many people\u2019s World Cup XIs because of his performances for Costa Rica, and previously included the club\u2019s \u00a311m record signing, Kostas Mitroglou, now on loan at Olympiakos, and Fernando Amorebieta, formerly of Athletic Bilbao. Every day they would be left to mundane exercises on the next pitch to where the first-team squad were going through their sprints. Maarten Stekelenburg used to be with them, too, until he moved to Monaco on loan, and the Magath way was very much to close them off as if they did not exist. Another player was seen talking to Stekelenburg and one of Magath\u2019s coaches ran over to tell him it was not permitted. Perhaps none of this would have mattered too much had Magath shown he was a brilliant tactician or motivator. Yet this was the man who played Dan Burn, a 6ft 6in centre-half, at right-back in the 4-1 defeat against Stoke City last season that tagged their toes for the relegation morgue. Burn found out on the day of the match and the poor bloke put in a performance that can be accurately measured by the Stoke Sentinel\u2019s post-match interview with Oussama Assaidi. \u201cI felt very sorry for their defender,\u201d the winger said. \u201cHe was a nice guy. He asked me to change sides, he didn\u2019t want to play against me any more.\u201d After that game, Magath turned on Burn in the dressing room. When Burn pointed out he had never played that position in his life he, too, was sent into a form of isolation (though, unlike others, he was eventually brought back). As for Magath\u2019s training methods, the stories are alarming. After one defeat, the German cancelled a day off and brought in everyone to play a full 90-minute match. At other times there have reputedly been three sessions in one day, some purely devoted to running the players until they were close to dropping. It was punishing and primitive and, slowly but surely, the Fulham players came to realise why Magath was known behind his back as \u201cSaddam\u201d at one of his former clubs. Fulham can hardly say they were unaware of what he was like when his other nickname from Germany was Qu\u00e4lix, a mix of Felix and the verb qu\u00e4len (to torture). Magath does have a record of achievement behind him but it is an outmoded style and now Fulham probably have a better idea now why Lewis Holtby, on loan from Tottenham, immediately asked to return to White Hart Lane when he found out that Magath, formerly his coach at Schalke, was taking over. In Germany, the joke is that Magath stopped winning matches because the opposition always included some of his former players \u2013 who disliked him so much they would give everything to beat him. Magath had not been in work for 18 months when Fulham\u2019s owner, Shahid Khan, offered him a way back in February and the only conclusion to draw is that his old-school style of boot camp management just does not work in modern-day football. Players don\u2019t want to run until they fall or operate in an environment where they hardly dare utter a word. When they have been made to run through woods for 45 minutes, they don\u2019t want to find the manager has emptied their water bottles for reasons only he knows. One story has emerged of Magath calling players into his office and then just staring at them for two or three minutes without saying a word. Another comes from this season when two of Fulham\u2019s first-year pros turned up late for training and Magath fined them so heavily it led to a meeting of the club\u2019s senior players to decide how to take him on. Eventually, the captain, Scott Parker, went to see him and tried to argue that the amount of money involved was not really fair for two teenagers on relatively low salaries. Parker explained there was a legitimate reason why they had been late and did his polite best to make it clear the punishment was disproportionate to the crime. Magath refused to budge. \u201cThey need to be taught a lesson,\u201d he said. Parker \u2013 a class act \u2013 ended up paying the fines. The theory here is that Magath brought through so many of Fulham\u2019s academy-produced players because it better suited his control-freakishness, on the basis they were less likely to argue and more likely to fall in line, like Daleks. There is a difference, though, between being a manager who wants power and rule and one who is unreasonable and dictatorial to the point that it alienates everyone. Magath, to put it bluntly, was an unpleasant man and the trail of ill feeling he has left behind him brings to mind what Jefferson Farf\u00e1n of Schalke once said about his former manager. \u201cAll the managers at Schalke in the last few years gave something to the club,\u201d Farf\u00e1n said. \u201cThe only coach who didn\u2019t leave anything positive behind was Magath. All he left behind were fines.\u201d For Fulham, it could take some while to repair the damage. Yet Symons, I\u2019m reliably informed, is one of football\u2019s good guys and already working to make Craven Cottage a happy place again behind the scenes. The chalk to Magath\u2019s cheese. Ferdinand should cut it out over Kick It Out It has been strange to see the amount of fuss about Rio Ferdinand having some uncomplimentary things to say about David Moyes \u201cbringing negativity and confusion\u201d in his latest autobiography. Ferdinand was one of the senior Manchester United players, with Nemanja Vidic and Ryan Giggs, whose position on Moyes influenced others and surely it is better that he is honest rather than sugarcoating everything with PR flannel. There is, however, something that puzzles me from the book\u2019s newspaper serialisation, when he gives his reasons for not wearing a Kick It Out T-shirt after John Terry\u2019s court case for allegedly racially abusing Ferdinand\u2019s younger brother, Anton, when Chelsea played a league game at Loftus Road in October 2011. \u201cThe group had refused to come to the court so I was not willing to go through the charade of wearing their shirt,\u201d Ferdinand has been, over the past week, widely reported as writing. \u201cMy parents would not have accepted it.\u201d Kick it Out refused to go to Terry\u2019s trial? That is some statement and wholly damaging for their reputation if true. Yet those of us who attended Westminster magistrates\u2019 court that week in July 2012 can distinctly remember the organisation\u2019s Danny Lynch sitting through every minute of the proceedings. He sat beside Ferdinand\u2019s parents, Julian and Janice, on all five days, right until the not guilty verdict came in and Terry\u2019s supporters started punching the air and pouring pink cava in the public gallery. At lunchtime every day Lynch and the Ferdinands would walk around the corner to Cafe Bolero to discuss the case. On the opposite side of Seymour Place, Terry\u2019s lot stared across from Eddie\u2019s Food Bar. Kick It Out could hardly have made it any clearer where they had aligned themselves. Andy Impey, a former team\u2011mate of Rio\u2019s from West Ham, was also in court to support the Ferdinands and was so impressed by Lynch he has become involved with Kick It Out. The book comes out on 2 October and you can imagine the deflation among the small yet dedicated staff at the Kick It Out office as a result of reading the serialisation. They probably deserve better than to be made someone else\u2019s punchbag when they are working on such a meagre budget above a pizza restaurant in Clerkenwell. Ferdinand has done plenty over a brilliant career to help the fight against racism and hopefully, when the book is seen in full, it will give a more rounded explanation of the real events. Time for Tour\u00e9 to quieten the critics In Florence to see how Micah Richards was setting into his new life, the conversation turned to the fact Fiorentina\u2019s new No4 was one of the few players at Manchester City to have been there before Abu Dhabi\u2019s money. When I asked him to nominate the best footballer he had played with in his 12 years at the club the first name he mentioned was David Silva. The next was Carlos Tevez because \u201a\u201cno disrespect to Sergio Ag\u00fcero, but he carried us\u201d. Richards also said Elano \u2013 \u201cridiculous talent, absolutely ridiculous\u201d \u2013 could have been a superstar if he had joined the club further into their development. Then he paused. \u201cThe most complete? Yaya Tour\u00e9. OK, we all know he doesn\u2019t track runners. We know that. But his technical ability \u2026 he\u2019s strong, he\u2019s fast, he can pass, he can shoot, he scored 20 goals last season from midfield and he\u2019s holding off defenders like it\u2019s the playground. He\u2019s the most complete, definitely.\u201d That is one hell of a compliment given the list of category-A footballers who have pulled on City\u2019s colours since the takeover and perhaps it explains why Tour\u00e9\u2019s deterioration this season has been so noticeable. He has struck me as semi-detached ever since the opening game at Newcastle and, for those of us in Munich on Wednesday, it should not have required his post-match clinch with Pep Guardiola to realise he did not seem entirely fixed on his night\u2019s work. Tour\u00e9 should be regarded as one of the outstanding players of the modern Premier League era. If he wants to turn the volume down on his critics, Sunday\u2019s game against Chelsea would be a good place to start."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
