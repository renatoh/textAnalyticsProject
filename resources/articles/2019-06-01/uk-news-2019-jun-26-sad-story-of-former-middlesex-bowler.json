But I then remembered that the \u201cWes\u201d Stewart I recalled from the late 1960s was only a nickname and that his real name was Richard. He was no batsman, but in two and a half seasons with Middlesex he took 127 wickets at the useful average of 24.25, and it was a surprise when he was released at the end of the 1968 season. Having heard nothing about him for over 50 years, it was shocking to hear that he had become a victim of the Windrush scandal and was now dead. A sad and disappointing story.
