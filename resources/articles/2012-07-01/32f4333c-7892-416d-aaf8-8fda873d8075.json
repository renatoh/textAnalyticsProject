As much as he loved it, it was not sufficiently nutritious to help the slim lightweight get past the second round in front of a similarly hungry crowd. Ron, the youngest of 10, was the breadwinner in the Cooper household, and custard and jelly was a cheap if unsubstantial staple of their diet in times when austerity was generated by the lingering hardship of a world war, not government policy. Ron, 84, lives not far from the site of the 2012 Olympics in Stratford and, as a surviving Olympian, he has tickets to the boxing. When he witnesses the fitness and stamina levels of the current squad, however, he might wonder how well he could have done if he had had the benefit of the hi-tech training methods and diet-to-the-minute eating regime of British boxers who will be as well prepared as those from any country in the competition. In 1948, their training was basic, with roadwork and sparring on alternate days, and their diet even more so. \"We were absolutely starved,\" says Ron, looking back on the days of wartime rationing, which went on until 1954. In 2012, a few weeks before the Olympics, a day at the Sheffield training headquarters of Robert McCracken's excellent group reveals how investment pays a dividend. The former British and Commonwealth middleweight champion and his team of strength coaches, nutritionists, physios and performance analysts will deliver a team of 10 super-fit boxers, seven men and three women, capable of winning a swag of medals, maybe even a couple of golds. It is a quite superb squad, maybe one with even more potential than the one Terry Edwards took to Beijing and which returned with a gold and two bronze. Edwards was poorly treated, a victim of the interminable squabbling that has dogged the sport for as long as anyone can remember, but McCracken has benefited from the subsequent full-scale structural shake-up of the sport. Boxers are virtually full-time athletes on fixed salaries, with weekday accommodation in Sheffield for easy access to the English Institute of Sport, where they have access to the latest developments in sports science. \"From here, it's full steam ahead,\" McCracken says in one of the many well-appointed offices in the EIS complex, while his fighters work the pads and three rings downstairs, each clicking to a meticulously worked-out timetable. \"They're really close, there's no issues with this lot, no prima donnas or egos. Your character in the squad is the captain, Anthony Stalker, who's ranked No1 in the world. They're a down-to-earth group. You'd maybe expect big [Anthony] Joshua to be a little bit [big-headed] but you couldn't meet a nicer, hard-working kid.\" Joshua could be the British star of the Olympics. He's big, fast and articulate, and professional promoters are already barraging him with offers. \"People forget when he arrived here he was a raw novice, nothing more,\" McCracken says. \"We took him to a couple of international training camps to show him how tough it was. He struggled. \"He won the ABAs but I didn't take him to the Commonwealth Games because he was very inexperienced. He took it fine, and developed. He's got a great attitude. Now to see him boxing the best [a silver that might have been gold at the world championships, in only his third senior tournament] it shows how he's improved. Above all he has the speed and that's the key: speed beats everything. \"There's good camaraderie between them \u2013 and they don't bat an eyelid with the girls in the gym. They never did two and a half years ago when they came in. They're just boxers to them. They work together, train together. There's a lot of experience there too: Nicola Adams, Savannah Marshall \u2013 as young as she is, she won a silver at the worlds two years ago. \"I was in China with the women [at the final qualification tournament] and Callum Smith sent a good luck message every day. And this is a kid who was really unlucky not to qualify [woefully judged in the last tournament, in Turkey, then passed over for a wild card in favour of a Montenegro boxer, Bosko Draskovic, whom he'd beaten by 10 points in April.] So, you'd think he'd be really down.\" They are used to success, their own and each other's. In three major tournaments before London \u2013 the world championships in 2011 and the Euros in 2010 and 2011 \u2013 the squad have won 13 medals: two gold, seven silver and four bronze. Mark Ellison, a nutritionist from EIS who works with GB Boxing \u2013 as well as Manchester United and Andy Murray \u2013 feeds them with scientific precision. So exact is the regime that weekly weight loss leading up to the Olympics will be measured in the tiniest amounts. \"You'll see the targets on the door for the next few weeks,\" Ellison says. \"No one's losing more than about 0.4kg to 0.5kg a week. It sounds like almost nothing but, at this level of elite sport, you've got to get that right over four, five weeks. Some of these guys are so good they're only dropping about 0.2kg a week, because that's all they need to do.\" In the gym kitchen, a fridge holds several boxes of pre-prepared food, individually sorted for each boxer. \"This is Nicola Adams's breakfast for tomorrow,\" Ellison says, \"chicken fajitas, there's the wraps to go with it. Nicky is the smallest boxer in the team so the portions reflect that, whereas Big Josh likes to eat two or three of these boxes. \"We get 48 hours' worth of food delivered to their door at a time. But then Nicky comes to me and says she's tired. We predicted her to lose 0.3kg over the week but the fact is she's lost 0.5kg. Tomorrow it's just a phone call to the company and Monday's delivery for Nicky is up by 200 calories, and I want all of that to come from carbohydrates. I ask them to put it all in the afternoon meal, because that's when she was feeling tired. Totally specific.\" Joshua walks in with a weighted neck-belt hanging around his shoulders, ready to do some serious strength work. He dips into the fruit box and peels back a couple of bananas. \"Nothing that fancy,\" he says of his cooking, but he attests to the claims that the diet, \"is really helpful. Best of both worlds. I've just got to take it home and eat it. But then I'll get some fresh meat, fresh fish, fresh salmon, maybe some potatoes. Couldn't survive on Nicola's diet. It's important to stay close to my best fighting weight, even at super-heavyweight. My best is around 106.5kg. At the minute, I'm at 107.1kg. I wouldn't want to be, like, 109kg. After competition you lose a lot of weight, sweating and so forth. I could weigh in after a fight at 104kg. If I sat back, that's losing energy. So I have a shake, something to eat, put the energy back in. It's all about smaller portions, no carbs at night. This [his condition] is going to stay on me now. I'll be ready.\" Luke Campbell is sitting on a nearby table, a wired-up ice pack strapped to his left shoulder. \"My shoulder's just a bit tight,\" he says. \"I need my body to recover so I can push it again tomorrow. If I'm not recovering, I can't push my body anymore, and get any fitter. It's like a lost day. \"I live in one of the flats nearby, Monday to Thursday. Then we go home Thursday tea-time, train at home on Fridays, Saturday. Sundays, rest at home, see my family. Definitely need them around me, to switch off from all this.\" What they all share with Ron Cooper is pride in the vest. \"The pinnacle of the amateur game was the Olympic Games,\" he said recently, \"to wear that Olympic blazer, with Great Britain on there. You feel proud, with the old beret, walking out, little 20-year-old, still wipin' his nose, like. When I got that Olympic blazer on, I thought I'd bust the buttons on me shirt.\" And you can bet it wasn't from being overweight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
