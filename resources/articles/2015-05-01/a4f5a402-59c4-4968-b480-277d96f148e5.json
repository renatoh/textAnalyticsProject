The body has made public its ruling of 23 April on the vexed question of whether the Kazakh team should have its licence to race withdrawn following two positive drugs tests in the WorldTour team and three in its development squad. \u201cThe commission reserves the right to reactivate the procedure,\u201d it said. The \u201creasoned decision\u201d of the licence commission, released by the UCI on Tuesday night, made it clear that Astana might well have lost its licence last autumn had the commission possessed the information revealed by the audit it commissioned from the University of Lausanne (ISSUL) at the end of last year after provisionally granting Astana permission to race. Instead, the Kazakh squad remains in the professional peloton after having shown sufficient signs of progress, and because, the statement said: \u201cThey have agreed to adhere to all the conditions set them, which will allow them to undertake profound reform to avoid the risk of doping.\u201d Their progress will be further monitored by the Swiss university and they clearly remain on probation, as they have been since December. The commission reveals that one reason why the UCI called for Astana\u2019s licence to be withdrawn was that the ISSU team found it had \u201cfabricated documents\u201d \u2013 training plans \u2013 \u201cexpressly to satisfy the inquiry team\u201d, but it concludes that this was done through \u201cclumsiness due to pressure\u201d rather than to an actual intention to deceive. It further states that, \u201cISSUL revealed that the team produced, both before the commission and for the attention of the auditors, documents presenting its way of working which did not correspond to reality\u201d. Astana is also criticised for \u201cglobally deficient\u201d management, \u201can old-school culture\u201d, poor back-up for its team of trainers, \u201cblurring of responsibilities due to the team management being too omnipresent\u201d and \u201cpoor control of riders who were geographically distant, notably the Russian-speakers.\u201d \u201cThe organization of the team is defective in that it pays little attention to at-risk riders,\u201d continued the report. The commission concluded that \u201cif these defects had been known in autumn 2014, withdrawal of the licence would have been probable\u201d and would have been even further justified because Astana initially claimed it was well organized and denied that it bore any responsibility for the doping cases.\u201d The UCI president, Brian Cookson \u2013 whose organisation had called for Astana\u2019s licence to be withdrawn following ISSUL\u2019s initial report \u2013 said he was satisfied with the commission\u2019s work and called the decision \u2018proportionate\u2019. \u201cAstana Pro Team has committed to a process of in-depth reforms thanks to this procedure initiated before the licence commission. Taking into account that the team will be under the supervision of the ISSUL and monitored by the licence commission for the rest of the 2015 season, we are satisfied by this decision \u2026 We are confident that the measures that the team has committed to put in place will help it improve its culture, its structures and its systems for governing anti-doping. We believe it is our responsibility to accompany each UCI WorldTeam towards increased professionalism.\u201d There is no implication that Nibali was involved in any of the activities outlined and Astana have still to make any formal comment on the commission\u2019s conclusions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
