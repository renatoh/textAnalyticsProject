Dani Osvaldo has said sorry for the training ground ruckus that led to the defender's injury last month and the striker being banished on loan to Juventus, but Fonte is not inclined to build bridges. For him Southampton's record signing is history. \"There have been a couple of text messages, apologising and stuff, but some things take time to heal,\" Fonte said. \"The situation has happened and the team, the manager and the club made everyone well aware that it would be best for him to move on. And for that to happen, obviously, the group felt there were no conditions for him to keep with us. It's as simple as that.\" Southampton will probably seek a permanent transfer for the Italian striker in the summer but with regard to the Premier League, what is the club's aim until then? Just how much does it matter that they twice let leads slip against Stoke before having to settle for a point? Saints are mid-table, removed from the relegation whirlpool but far adrift of the top four. The manager, Mauricio Pochettino, is adamant that although qualifying for the Europa League would be a tremendous achievement, the tournament does not interest him. He suggested last week that it should be abolished because it \"kills\" clubs. \"For Southampton it would be great if they were playing in the Europa League but it's not a competition that appeals to me,\" he said. So is the FA Cup the only thing left to excite Southampton players? Has the Premier League been reduced to a list of residual fixtures that must be fulfilled? No, because there are still some big clubs to be overhauled and, moreover, many squad members hope to go to the World Cup. \"We are playing with a lot at stake,\" Fonte said. \"We want to catch Newcastle, be closer to Manchester United or whoever is next. We will keep pushing hard and try and finish as high as possible. And people want to go to Brazil, people want to perform to be on the plane to play at the World Cup.\" There are half a dozen Englishmen at Southampton with decent chances of being summoned by Roy Hodgson and Fonte hopes Portugal will invite him to show how much he has improved. \"Why can't I dream about it?\" he said. \"I hope I have a chance at least to prove myself. Since Mauricio took over, he made me a better player \u2026 He gives a lot of emphasis to the defensive line. Tactically he's very, very good. He gives you a lot of advice in terms of positioning, in terms of aggression, anticipation, interceptions, play, be brave, and he gives you the confidence to go on the pitch and give everything for him.\" Stoke, meanwhile, want to extricate themselves from the brawl in the bottom half of the table. The draw at St Mary's, after a home win over Manchester United, convinced them they are on the right track. Before then Stoke had the worst away record in the league but goals from Peter Odemwingie and Peter Crouch cancelled out those by Rickie Lambert and Steven Davis to ensure that they secured the point their performance deserved. Odemwingie's goal was his first since joining from Cardiff last month and the striker says he feels more appreciated than he did at the Welsh club, where he never once completed 90 minutes. \"Very often I was pulled out of games [at Cardiff],\" he said. \"It was a similar situation all the time, the team not doing too well, I would be the first to be pulled off and no player can be happy with that \u2026 When I am happy I play well.\" Man of the match Charlie Adam (Stoke)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
