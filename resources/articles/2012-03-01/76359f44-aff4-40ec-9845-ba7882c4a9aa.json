It was taken over by AXA, and now Friends Life has appeared on the scene. The first word from them, in a 22-page letter that arrived on 2 February, was that the value of the policies would be reduced by 60%. Either that, or we could have the premiums trebled to retain the same value. Aged 72, we started these policies for our two sons as an inheritance, both being put into trust for them. We have asked for details of who Friends Life are and why the policy values are being slashed, but perhaps you could help? RS, Folkestone AXA merged its business with Friends Provident in 2010, which resulted in the new brand Friends Life. You now hold two \"whole-of-life\" insurance policies with Friends Life. Unfortunately, these policies are notoriously complex and often subject to huge, sudden premium increases. They also earned the person who sold it to you a bumper commission payment. Your policies passed the first review in 2002 and the following review in 2007, with no resulting increase in premium. This year, however, Friends Life decided your monthly premium of \u00a348.89 is not sufficient to maintain your benefits. You now have the option to either increase your premium to \u00a3146.56 each month, or reduce the level of your life cover from \u00a3142,658 to \u00a366,101. This is a huge drop and so we checked this with two financial advisers, one at London &amp; Country and the other at Informed Choice. Both said that, unfortunately, the figures are likely to be correct as this is the way these policies work and thousands of other people in your position are being hit by similar shocking increases. You now have three choices: to keep your premium the same but see your cover more than halve; to increase your monthly premium by almost \u00a3100 \u2013 something, as pensioners, you say you cannot afford to do; or to surrender the policy. This is currently \u00a31,795.65 on each policy. However, while you might have to accept that the figures are right you still have another course of action open to you. If you feel the policy was missold to you back in 1992 you can take your case to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), which will look at it free of charge. The FOS saw the number of complaints about whole-of-life polices almost double in the last six months of last year compared with the previous six months. It is currently upholding around a third of these cases in consumers' favour, which could entitle you to compensation. You can contact it on 0800 023 4567.
