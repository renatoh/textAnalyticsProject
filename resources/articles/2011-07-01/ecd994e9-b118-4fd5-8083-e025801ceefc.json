It would also be a seriously mistaken view of Sir Nicolas Bratza's new role \u2013 since, as the Daily Mail regretfully acknowledged yesterday, he is \"duty bound to act impartially\". Yet the election is welcome, timely and important. It is welcome because Sir Nicolas, who has served with distinction on the court since 1998, deserves the honour; Strasbourg watchers say that there is no finer judge there. But it is timely too, since it marks an opportunity to promote a more thoughtful debate about the court and human rights law \u2013 as well as a chance to assist useful reforms. Sir Nicolas will not be president for long enough \u2013 he only serves until late 2012 \u2013 to revolutionise the court, even if he wanted to. But all defenders of human rights should want Sir Nicolas and the justice secretary Kenneth Clarke (who becomes chair of the Council of Europe's council of ministers in November) to use this window of opportunity to help shape the court, and the debate about it, more constructively. No one person will ever be able to reverse the reactionary xenophobia which infuses so much of the debate about human rights in this country. But Sir Nicolas and Mr Clarke have a rare joint opportunity to give the convention and court greater trust and credibility. It is vital that they make the most of this important chance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
