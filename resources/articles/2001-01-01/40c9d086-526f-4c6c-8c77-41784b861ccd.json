At a meeting attended by NUJ and print union members at a venue outside Ludgate House, journalists discussed what they see as Ms Boycott's inability to improve redundancy terms for staff from Northern &amp; Shell. In particular, some journalists and managers believe the notorious email sent to owner Richard Desmond, which complained of his heavy-handed management, was inappropriate because it singled out some individuals whom he wanted to make redundant. In the email, which was leaked to the media, Ms Boycott castigated Mr Desmond after he outlined plans to get rid of two pregnant women and one long-term staff member who was disabled and had been promised a job for life under previous regimes. Although Ms Boycott was praised from some quarters for standing up for her staff, editorial sources say the people mentioned in the letter were not grateful for being singled out. Meanwhile, Northern &amp; Shell managers are in detailed discussions with unions about severance pay for staff in the sales, marketing and administration departments. Northern &amp; Shell is thought to have given ground on redundancy pay, and is now considering settlements of three weeks' pay for each year of service plus a month's full pay. The new offers are an improvement on the company's previous offer of a month's pay. Unions are also thought to have secured more voluntary redundancy terms. A source said: \"Northern &amp; Shell has accepted that it's easier to negotiate through the unions and the situation is improving. But Rosie's not interested and she's not helping the situation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
