But the ball drops short of Best, before bouncing past his comedy dive and allowing Jones to escape the strike. Join me at 5.45pm for more hot rearguard action. \"I noted a \"urination in the vicinity of a famous person story\" had crept in and thought I would chuck in my own personal favourite,\" writes Philip Langeskov. \"A few years ago Middlesex played Glamorgan at Lord's. So far, so believable. At close of play I popped into the Tavern for a drink. Several hours later, I found myself at the urinal with Robert Croft to my left, Tuffers to my right and Fat Gatt loitering in the background awaiting a space/forklift home. That, my friends, is pressure. Stage fright doesn't even come close.\" 81st over: England 230-8 (Flintoff 68, Jones 0) Flintoff plays out a Hinds maiden in the mistaken belief that it was the last over before lunch. It wasn't. \"Booker T's hand-waving exploits signify that he was in fact a \"5 time\" WCW champion,\" says Richard Mason, \"and occur after he has completed some kind of half-assed breakdance routine that he calls a spinarooney.\" 80th over: England 230-8 (Flintoff 68, Jones 0) Seven down at lunch would have given England hope. Eight down makes it very hard. They're doing what they often do in these circumstances and losing wickets at crucial moments. Meanwhile, Collins bowls his 14th no-ball of the innings. \"Yes, I saw that impression of Lara missing his catch,\" reveals Oliver Milman. \"The joker in the Windies team did a comical little skit involving waving his arms about and then falling over in front of his chuckling team-mates and the unimpressed looking Lara. He looked like he was about to say 'What about that 400 though eh?'\" WICKET! Hoggard c Jacobs b Collins 1 (229-8) Three balls after putting down Flintoff off his own bowling, Collins finally finds Hoggard's outside edge with a delivery that moves away as the batsman plays forward. Shame. \"Lawrence, Lawrence, pleeeeeease make it stop,\" writes Amy Jackson. \"I don't like it. Take us back to the glory days of a couple of weeks ago. Just lie, most of us won't realise until we hear a snippet at the end of the 10 o'clock news, by which time you'll be long gone. Actually, spring is making me feel a little flighty, I'll take Alex Clarke's bet on thumper Flintoff getting 401. I feel lucky.\" 79th over: England 227-7 (Flintoff 67, Hoggard 1) Not long to go before lunch now, and if these two can hang around until then, England will be delighted. The only problem is that the second new ball is due the over after next, and that could spell a swift end to the resistance. For the time being, Corey Collymore comes on for his first bowl of the morning and finds Hoggard's outside edge with his third delivery. But it drops short of Ridley Jacobs behind the stumps. A testing maiden to start with. \"If Hoggard gets a hundred you will eat your words about me dribbling yesterday!\" writes Howard Thomson, dribbling slightly. 78th over: England 227-7 (Flintoff 67, Hoggard 1) After another Collins no-ball Hoggard finally gets off the mark after 25 balls and 39 minutes with a single to midwicket. The Barmy Army enjoy that one. Flintoff celebrates by hammering Collins straight back past him all along the ground for four. As poultry supremo Bernard Matthews might have put it: bootiful! \"All your email correspondents seem to hail from such glamorous places,\" complains Monica Kendall. \"I'm in central London and the only cricket news I'm getting is by refreshing the Guardian - is that sad?\" On the contrary, Monica. It makes you a well-adjusted individual with impeccable taste. 77th over: England 220-7 (Flintoff 63, Hoggard 0) Hinds to Flintoff, who might well be playing his first-ever vigil here for England. Never thought I'd write Flintoff and vigil in the same sentence. Hinds serves up a full-toss which Freddie helps to long leg for four. \"So Batty fails,\" notes Darren Nesbitt, clearly setting himself up for the punchline. \"They should have picked Ashley Giles: he's in the runs.\" Good grief. 76th over: England 216-7 (Flintoff 59, Hoggard 0) Flintoff is playing sensibly here, taking the majority of the strike against the faster bowlers and working Collins for two more through midwicket, followed by a single off yet another no-ball, his 11th of the innings to go with a wide. Collins then beats Hoggard's push with a beauty that somehow misses everything. Dodgy rumours department: \"A friend of my sister is a doctor and she swears blind that one of her patients is billionaire Bill Gates's brother,\" claims Alex Porritt. \"The strange bit is that he's a heavily tattooed grave digger from Sussex. Seems unlikely to me. Has anyone else heard this rumour?\" 75th over: England 212-7 (Flintoff 56, Hoggard 0) The madman Best spent most of the drinks break talking to the Sky commentary team via the middle-stump microphone. What a character! Back to the cricket, and Hoggard is surrounded by close fielders as he faces Hinds. They were giving him grief in the last over - especially Sarwan and Best - but Hoggy likes a challenge and that's a maiden. \"I once saw an inebriated Roland Gift (of Fine Young Cannibal's fame) perform a solo dance entitled The Wasp,\" reports Neil Appleton. \"This involves waving a hand in front of one's face as if trying to ward off ... a wasp. I've also (inadvertantly &amp; on a separate occasion) urinated on his shoes. Does this help? 74th over: England 212-7 (Flintoff 56, Hoggard 0) Flintoff picks up two runs to long leg off Collins, who has looked dangerous all morning. But that's another no-ball, which Flintoff attempts to hit towards Barbuda. He misses. Flintoff is then dropped at wide third slip by Powell, who dives to his left but can only get fingertips to a tough chance. Great bowling, and that's drinks. \"No idea what Edwards's celebration is all about,\" writes Richard Mason, \"but did you see his impression of Brian Lara's missed catch as the Windies were walking off the pitch last night? Pure comedy genius.\" Missed that, Richard. Did it involve some amusing flailing of both arms followed by head in hands, by any chance? 73rd over: England 209-7 (Flintoff 54, Hoggard 0) Lara turns to Ryan Hinds, who bowls serviceable left-arm spin, and Flintoff works him for a single into the leg-side. This time Hoggard is left with three deliveries to face, which he manages, despite the advice of Sarwan from under the helmet at short leg. \"By the sounds of it, Edwards' \"funny wavey thing\" is probably accompanied by a shout of \"you can't see me\", which is apparently a common gesture in Northern America and quite accurate given the fact that Jones played all round his delivery,\" explains Ben Jackson. \"Don't ask me how I know this.\" 72nd over: England 208-7 (Flintoff 53, Hoggard 0) Flintoff works Edwards to square-leg for a chancy single. He's happy to give Hoggard two balls an over to face, although Hoggard is tempted to have a drive at a full-length ball that swings late and beats the outside edge. \"Having been in deepest China for the past two and a half weeks,\" writes Chris Armstrong, \"I'd quite forgotten there was a cricket series on, until I woke this morning, put CNN on and found out that some bloke called Brian had broken a record. Honest, it was on CNN. There's nothing like an American trying to get excited about cricket. Apparently Brian has singlehandedly prevented a 'four to zero shutout' with 'four maximum hits'.\" Well, it could have been worse... 71st over: England 207-7 (Flintoff 52, Hoggard 0) Flintoff pulls Edwards for a single that drops just two yards in front of Best at deep square-leg. That would have been a sickening conclusion to a very good innings. Whatever time England's last three wickets can eat up will be a bonus. Edwards oversteps by about a foot to take extras to 21 and Hoggard survives. \"There's a wrestler called Booker T,\" writes Peter Williams a propos Edwards's hand-wave, \"who does something a bit similar with his hand before crushing hapless opponenents, in the WWE (one-sided entertainment showpiece with pre-determined result - think the 2003 cricket World Cup and you're close). Maybe it's a tribute to him?\" 70th over: England 205-7 (Flintoff 51, Hoggard 0) Matthew Hoggard drags himself off the sick-bed to defend his first three balls from Collins. England trail by 546. \"No offence Lawrence,\" writes Sam Graham, \"but you seem pretty unenthused by this game. Is that the case?\" I take every offence, Sam. This is me at my most effusive. WICKET! Batty c Gayle b Collins 8 (205-7) Whoops. Just as I start to write Batty up he drives Collins into the midriff of Gayle at first slip. Poor shot. 69th over: England 204-6 (Flintoff 50, Batty 8) Another maiden from Edwards to Batty, who is knuckling down here and generally putting the top order (bar Butcher) to shame. \"Interesting to note how the dietary preferences of cricketers and commentators have changed,\" writes Richard Moseley-Williams in Santo Domingo. \"On Test Match Special 20 years ago Brian Johnston et al in the box at Lord's used to drool over the cakes sent by well-wishers. Meanwhile the players were looking forward to a serious session in the bar after stumps. Today not a drop of alcohol passes down the gullets of the Test squad for the duration of the tour, while our GU commentator struggles unsuccessfully to disguise the effects of last night's heavy sampling of donated Grenadian rum.\" Ok, ok, so I wrote \"opints\" earlier rather than \"points\", but I can assure that the slip was Freudian, as Duncan Carmichael wrote in to suggest earlier, rather than hangover-induced. 68th over: England 204-6 (Flintoff 50, Batty 8) Flintoff moves to his half-century with a sweet cover-drive for four off Collins, who is still going round the wicket. \"Isn't this innings further proof that Flinty is actually a class act with the bat (with a slight weakness against spin), as opposed to the slogger image which has been put forward in certain quarters?\" asks Daniel Jones. Class act is putting it a little strongly for a man who averages less than 27 in Tests, Daniel, but I think he's slowly learning how to play more responsibly. I saw him make a very mature 70-odd amid the carnage of a collapse in Colombo before Christmas. 67th over: England 200-6 (Flintoff 46, Batty 8) The first over after a rather long drinks break is bowled by Edwards, but Batty is right in behind the line, which is one of his favourite pastimes. I like Batty - he never looks flustered. \"Does anyone know what the Edwards celebration means other than possibly wiping the grin from the batsman's face?\" asks Craig Swinburn. Sounds like a good suggestion to me, Craig. 66th over: England 200-6 (Flintoff 46, Batty 8) Collins delivers another no-ball, and West Indies have already conceded more extras (18) than England did (16) in a total of 751-5. Flintoff then edges another no-ball just in front of Chris Gayle at first slip, before Collins oversteps for the third time in the over to bring up England's 200. Small mercies etc. \"So what are considered Lara's greatest batting performances?\" asks Franklin Kostia. Er, 400 not out yesterday is up there. As is the 501* he made for Warwickshire v Durham in 1994 and the 375 he hit at this ground, also against England, a few months earlier. There are a couple of knocks against the Aussies too. Too many to mention, really. 65th over: England 197-6 (Flintoff 46, Batty 8) Batty picks up four runs off the outside edge off the incandescent Best, who does all he can to stop himself taking a swing at the batsman. West Indies are sending a lot down the leg-side here, which England won't mind one bit. \"Not that I'd want to see England trying to shut the game out or anything,\" writes Josh Robinson, \"but now many overs are deducted from the total to be played for a change-of-innings? These things could make a huge difference.\" Fair point, Josh. The answer is two, unless the innings ends just before a scheduled interval. 64th over: England 193-6 (Flintoff 46, Batty 4) Pedro Collins replaces his half-brother Edwards, but there's no swing and one ball is so wide outside off-stump that Darrell Hair exercises his, er, muscular arms. Collins goes round the wicket and Flintoff thick-edges an uppish drive to third man for four. \"If you've got a moment, Lawrence, could you describe the \"funny wavey thing\" in front of his face that Edwards does,\" writes Naun Grewal. \"Is it like a regal wave ? Is it a 60 swinging swimming fish type ? I am actually interested and have no TV.\" No problem, Nanu. He holds the palm of his hand - not sure which one - in front of his face and shakes it from side to side with a big grin on his face. It's quite infectious, if not especially regal. 63rd over: England 188-6 (Flintoff 42, Batty 4) Best whistles one past Flintoff and then gives him the mother of all stares. But Freddie's damned if he's blinking first! Aleem Dar, meanwhile, gives Best his first warning for running on the pitch after several close calls. Just a Flintoff single to deep backward square in that over. A joke from Peter Lee. \"What's the difference between Brian Lara and Graeme Hick? One's a flat-track bully only capable of scoring significant runs on dead pitches against weakened bowling attacks in matches that no longer matter after having choked completely in the previous games and the other plays for Worcestershire!\" 62nd over: England 187-6 (Flintoff 41, Batty 4) An Edwards no-ball keeps the scoreboard ticking over as Gareth Batty tries to settle in and play one of the barnacle-like innings he came up with in Sri Lanka. Like Ashley Giles, Batty is something of a specialist No8, and he plays a lovely off-drive for four as Edwards overpitches. England trail by 564. \"The Geneva Windies community echoes Mr. Wrigley's experience,\" writes Richard Jones. \"Before the 400 they were angry about his 'prima donna' appearances in the batting order when it seemed best for him. The 400 seems to have prompted the following question: supposing someone else was captain, would Lara have been allowed to stay that long?\" 61st over: England 182-6 (Flintoff 41, Batty 0) That was a pretty impressive maiden Test innings from Geraint Jones. I liked the way he was aggressive throughout - must be the Aussie in him. Best is still staring insanely at Flintoff, on that occasion because a harmless leg-side delivery dribbled off Freddie's pads into the middle of the pitch. God knows what he'll do when he beats the bat. \"Is the whitewash still on?\" asks Allan Knox. \"I've been out the office over the weekend - what is the score - do Vaughan and co need a quick fifty to win? Do Harmison and Freddie need to knock over the tail? Tell me more.\" When you say out of the office, Allan, do you in fact mean on another planet? You've missed a world record. Not much apart from that. 60th over: England 182-6 (Flintoff 41, Batty 0) I still think these last four wickets are the key to whether England can save this game. The aim of the tail is to hang around for as long as possible to reduce the amount of time England need to bat in their second innings. Anything more than four and a half sessions will be very hard indeed. \"You clearly tried that rum last night, for it was Sunday that I popped round, not Friday!\" points out Mat Wrigley. Whoops. WICKET! Jones b Edwards 38 (182-6) So much for the fightback. Edwards gets some reverse swing into Jones, who plays round a full-length delivery and is bowled through the gate. Edwards does that funny wavey thing with his hand in front of his face and England are deep in the mire once more. \"Curious how your start time slipped gradually from 2:30 to 2:45 to 3:00,\" opints out the far-too-observant Tim Reston. \"Lunch down the pub perhaps?\" I wish it had been, Tim, but I think the guys on the desk here were hedging their bets about the start time. And generally getting it wrong. 59th over: England 179-5 (Flintoff 38, Jones 38) Tino Best is fit again after leaving the field yesterday afternoon and his first ball is short and cut away to the vacant third man for four by Jones. Best looks suitably aggrieved, although for once he seems lost for words. A leg-side bye follows, before Flintoff gets going with an edgy single through square-leg. Jones then takes two through midwicket and that's a good opening over for England. \"Ok - so the big money bet is on Freddie Flintoff scoring 401 not out,\" writes Alex Clarke. \"Any takers?\" The silence is deafening, Alex. 3.02pm If Flintoff and Jones can carry on where they left off last night, then all is not lost. If West Indies take an early wicket, life will be very difficult indeed for England. Here's Mat Wrigley, who kindly popped in on Friday with a bottle of rum before returning to Grenada. \"The customs officer at Point Salines airport was indignant when I asked her about Brian Lara on arrival yesterday,\" he reports. \"'Don't talk to me about Lara, I don't want to know - he only in it for himself!' She then went on to speculate as to whether he had taken money from an Englishman to throw the series. She then went on to take $25US from an Englishman for the import of a Jeep water pump.\" I like it. 3pm Hello. The office feels a bit fuller today, but I'll do my best to concentrate as England embark on what, we hope, will be a two-day vigil to save the fourth and final Test in Antigua. They resume this morning - on a day of 98 overs - on 171 for 5, with Flintoff (37) and Geraint Jones (32) holding the fort. The task is simple: bat out the remaining 188 overs in the match before they lose their remaining 15 wickets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
