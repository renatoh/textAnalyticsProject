Ars\u00e8ne Wenger reckons it is too early to wail about the same old failings, however. \u201cLet\u2019s not go overboard,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe lost one game. I can understand that [disappointment] but overall I believe there were a lot of positives in the game as well because we created many chances. We had great domination and unfortunately we dropped three points.\u201d It would be much easier to accentuate the positives if Wenger had not grasped for an almost Trumpian conspiracy theory straight after the defeat when suggesting that he was not surprised that fouls on H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn and Danny Welbeck had not resulted in penalties for Arsenal. \u201cWe don\u2019t get penalties, we know that. I can get the numbers, you will see. Look at the statistics: we had the highest penalties against us at home by a mile and the lowest for us.\u201d That is fake news. Arsenal did not have the highest number of penalties awarded against them at home in the Premier League last season: Watford had the same number (five) and Hull City had more (six). Nor did Arsenal have the fewest awarded in their favour: 10 teams got fewer penalties at home than Arsenal last season. Perhaps Wenger was thinking of the 2015-16 league campaign, when Arsenal were not awarded any penalties at the Emirates Stadium? If so, that will not do much to quell detractors who say the Frenchman is struggling to keep pace with events. But why was Wenger complaining about the number of penalties awarded against his team at home after being denied penalties in an away match? (For the record, Arsenal were given two penalties in away matches in last season\u2019s league campaign, which was more than Manchester United and the champions, Chelsea). Similarly Wenger\u2019s contention that Alexandre Lacazette\u2019s disallowed goal at Stoke was \u201c100% onside\u201d was invalidated by replays. The charitable explanation for Wenger\u2019s skewed versions of events is that he is a sore loser. Another explanation could be that he wanted to erect a smokescreen to obscure his team\u2019s failings. The most alarming explanation would be that he simply refuses to recognise reality when it does not suit him. These, of course, are not new choices. Arsenal fans have been puzzling and arguing over them for years and Wenger\u2019s eventual signing of a new contract earlier this summer does not seem to have changed that. Has anything significant changed at Arsenal? The evidence from Stoke was not encouraging. Sure, Wenger was right to point to positives: Arsenal\u2019s passing and movement was at times wonderful and the home team\u2019s goalkeeper, Jack Butland, had to excel on occasions, as did their centre-backs, particularly Kurt Zouma. But Arsenal\u2019s finishing was shoddy and their defending flaky. Not being clinical and not being solid is a recipe for not being title contenders. In midfield Granit Xhaka gave the ball away too often while Mesut \u00d6zil was inventive with it but ineffective without it. Again one had to wonder whether standards are set high enough at Arsenal. Who should Wenger blame for that? And what about Wenger\u2019s selections? Those of his counterpart, Mark Hughes, paid off, as Jes\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez sparkled and scored on his debut, despite training only three times with his new side. The Spaniard\u2019s goal came via a one-two with Saido Berahino, a substitute who made an impact. Wenger\u2019s substitutions, meanwhile, were unsuccessful, with the withdrawal of Lacazette as Arsenal chased the game quite curious. Arsenal had struggled to serve their \u00a352.7m striker for most of the match but, having scored against Leicester City on his league debut, Lacazette gave another demonstration of his finishing skills when lashing a shot into the Stoke net in the 72nd minute, unaware that he was millimetres offside. He had drifted in from the right to score that \u2018goal\u2019, having been shunted wide a few minutes earlier after the introduction of Olivier Giroud as a centre-forward. But Lacazette\u2019s display of sharpness did not convince Wenger he was likely to strike again, so the manager replaced him with Theo Walcott with 12 minutes left. \u201cI wanted to put Walcott on because he can cross for Giroud,\u201d Wenger said. Opta statistics show that Walcott went on to send no crosses to anyone. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, meanwhile, had supplied several dangerous crosses from his right wing-back role until his attacking influence dwindled after Wenger\u2019s shift to a flat back four. On the other side, Beller\u00edn continually raced into threatening positions as a left wing-back but then either bungled or, on one occasion, was fouled when poised to shoot. Beller\u00edn\u2019s influence waned after the switch to 4-4-2. All in all, things did not go to Wenger\u2019s plan. The manager is right that this season is very young \u2013 but the problem is old. Wenger still relies on players who have never been reliable. Maybe they will eventually develop consistency and he will be vindicated. Believing in that requires deep faith. At least Arsenal\u2019s defence should be stronger when Laurent Koscielny comes back. And their attacking will be even better if Alexis S\u00e1nchez returns. Rumours continue to swirl about Manchester City buying the Chilean but Wenger says the player could face Liverpool for Arsenal next weekend. He warned, however, not to expect too much. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how he goes through the week,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cHe was out with a muscular strain and hopefully he will survive the tests first before he comes back. He\u2019s not played now for six weeks and it\u2019s difficult to be at your best in the first game straight away.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
