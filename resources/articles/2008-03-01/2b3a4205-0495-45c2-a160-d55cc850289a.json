Under the renegotiated buyout, JP Morgan will pay nearly $1.2bn in stock for Bear Stearns rather than the $236m agreed a week ago. But the superior price met with resistance at the Federal Reserve which is guaranteeing Bear Stearns' riskiest assets with public money. To get the transaction done quickly, Bear Stearns' board is to issue 95m new shares allowing JP Morgan to take an immediate 39.5% stake. \"We believe the amended terms are fair to all sides and reflect the value and risks of the Bear Stearns franchise,\" said JP Morgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon. The higher offer sent Wall Street shares sharply higher as it helped to restore shaky confidence in the banking system. By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 221 points to 12,582. All week, employees and investors in Bear Stearns have raged against the knockdown price at which the firm was to be sold. Analysts believe up to 8,000 of the bank's 14,000 staff could lose their jobs and many employees had savings and pension funds tied up in Bear Stearns shares. According to reports in the American media, the degree of fury has been so intense that Bear's 74-year-old chairman, Jimmy Cayne, has acquired an armed bodyguard. Faced with the prospect of a lengthy legal battle with leading shareholders including the British billionaire Joe Lewis who has a 9% stake, JP Morgan came back to the table with more money. But the renegotiation met with scepticism from the US authorities who are anxious to avoid setting a precedent of using taxpayers' money to support a deal in which shareholders get significant compensation for an investment in a failed enterprise. Officials at the Fed and the US Treasury felt that their support for a rescue of Bear Stearns was easier to justify in political terms if a deal was the only option to avert bankruptcy \u2013 and if investors got little benefit. \"The Federal Reserve is in a very difficult position here,\" said Richard Bove, a banking analyst at stockbroker Punk, Ziegel &amp; Co. \"They're defending the US taxpayer, they're defending the banking system. They're looking at what precedents they're establishing in this situation. They have much broader things to think about that this one transaction with Bear Stearns.\" Under the amended deal, JP Morgan will take the first $1bn of any losses incurred in Bear's portfolio of derivatives and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed will take the next $29bn. But the Fed also stands to benefit from any potential upside. It will employ the investment firm Blackrock to \"manage\" Bear's riskiest assets and the public warchest will collect any profits if the portfolio's value increases. Staff at Bear's tower block in midtown Manhattan have been leaving work all week with boxes and carrier bags of belongings in preparation for redundancies. Insiders say that the firm's trading floor is doing little business \u2013 and there is concern that clients could be lost forever unless a buyout is swiftly concluded. Some of Bear's bankers are deploying a dark sense of humour to cope with the situation. In an email leaked to the New York Post, one executive, Mike Pagano, confirmed to clients that a Bear Stearns energy conference will go ahead but in a wry reference to job uncertainty, he added: \"If you need additional maintenance staff: I'm a great duster and I'm downright dangerous with a vacuum.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
