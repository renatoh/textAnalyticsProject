Even a syllable is precious now. It is a bit like a parent straining to hear language emerging from their baby\u2019s babble of sound \u2013 but with a baby this emergent language marks the beginning of the great formation of the self, and is full of hope and possibility. With the person who lives \u2013 and who dies \u2013 with dementia, the language that connects us to others is disappearing, the self is being broken up. An entire world is being un-made. We come to darkness, silence, the radical slowing of death: dementia\u2019s long goodbye. The honourable, often courageous, tradition of journalists to uncover what is hidden is celebrated by the Orwell prize. In the new category for which I was shortlisted, \u201cExposing Britain\u2019s Social Evils\u201d, there were wonderful stories that investigated hidden worlds (banks, hospitals, detention centres\u2026) to find out the stark truth of what went on there, behind barred doors. I wrote about dementia and the arts in an attempt to find a language for what has become wordless. Today, art is freshly and imaginatively illuminating the experience of self-loss in a way that no external, factual account, however vivid, can do. Art may take us to the very edge of darkness. But dementia is not hidden \u2013 or if it is, it is hidden in plain sight. More than a million people in the UK have dementia. One in three hospital beds are occupied by them. They are everywhere; among us, in the streets we walk along, the shops we go into; even in our homes. We see them, and we don\u2019t see them. We know them, and we don\u2019t know them. They are our society\u2019s ghosts, and we should be haunted. Instead, we often talk about them as objects: they are (cruellest phrase) \u201cbed-blockers\u201d. They are burdens. They are problems to be solved. They are terrifying statistics. They are bureaucratic impediments. Because they are incomprehensible to us, they scare us; and because they are old and their body decaying, they even disgust us, for they remind us of life\u2019s unbearable truth: we all must die. They are not hidden \u2013 but we are often hiding from them and their shattered meanings, and so hiding from ourselves, from the old person we will, if we are lucky, one day become. The piece that I wrote about dementia and the arts was one of many articles I\u2019ve written in the Observer about the care of people with dementia, and was born out of a campaign that I have been running with my friend and co-campaigner, Julia Jones. John\u2019s Campaign fights for more compassionate and person-centred care in the medicalised and often intimidating space of the hospital. Over the past 18 months, I have met and worked with fabulous, kind and heroic carers, nurses and doctors, and I have also seen the terrifying cost of dementia to all those whose lives are touched by it. There is so much loneliness and so much loss. But humanity must not be lost. On corkboards above the beds where dementia patients lie, confused and often scared, there are often photographs of them when they were younger. So somewhere inside that old woman lying slack and corpse-like is also her younger self: radiant, beautiful, just setting out on her journey. That man, crying out for help on a tormented loop, is also the father holding his new baby in his arms. Art encourages us to see them as precious and as human. As one of us. If the Orwell prize recognises journalists who uncover what is hidden, it also honours those who give a voice to the voiceless, to those who cannot speak for themselves or tell their own story. This is political journalism in its deepest sense (and it is why the Joseph Rowntree foundation, which works with the marginalised and the dispossessed, is such an appropriate sponsor of the \u201cExposing Britain\u2019s Social Evils\u201d category). Telling stories is part of what makes us human. With stories, we make sense of the world and impose a kind of order on to chaos. We continually edit our own lives into a narrative that will give it a coherent meaning: without this, we\u2019re lost. And people with advanced dementia become lost: lost to us and lost themselves. They can no longer speak themselves and without memory to bind the pieces of their life together, they are trapped in an endless present. Since my father\u2019s illness and his sad, long dying, I have been trying to tell their stories. After I won the prize and was walking around the hall grinning like a pumpkin and two glasses in, person after person came up to me to say: me too. I have a story to tell about my mother, my father, my loved one. Sometimes the stories are good ones: last Thursday, one woman told me how she had repaired her relationship with her mother during her illness, and how being her carer had been a painful gift. A man described his father driving his car through the fog and unable to find his way home. (Of course, home here also means the home of the self.) We are all Ancient Mariners, carrying the stories that we are compelled to tell, to share and pass on. The stories that journalists write can help us imagine what it is like to be other people, to empathise with experiences that are very different from our own, and to forge bonds with different cultures and histories. But while we can identify backward, because we know what it is to be young, it is hard to identify forward. Until we arrive there, old age is a foreign country. The question of how we care for those with dementia is also a question of how we live and how we die. It is about what it means to be human. We are all human. We all have stories."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
