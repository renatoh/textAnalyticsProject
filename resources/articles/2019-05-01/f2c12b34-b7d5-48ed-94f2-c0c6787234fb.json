Rice has been linked with Manchester United since he broke into the first team last season. But the 20-year-old says he is content at West Ham, citing a special relationship with the fans. \u201cI know that there\u2019s speculation but I signed a five-year contract with West Ham during the season,\u201d Rice said. \u201cSo my focus is fully on playing for West Ham. I\u2019ve got a great connection with the fans; the fans love me and I love them and that\u2019s the way it is at the moment. I\u2019m not thinking about anything else, for sure.\u201d Rice was one of the early arrivals at St George\u2019s Park as England prepare for the chance to claim a first piece of silverware since Le Tournoi in 1997. With players from Chelsea, Liverpool and Spurs still performing club duties, the group remains below full strength. Only 17 of the 25 players are on-site. Rice, however, has been part of the camp for more than a week and on Tuesday took part in his first training match, playing Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s under-21 side in a match the seniors won 5-0. Next Thursday the action begins for real when England face the Netherlands in Guimar\u00e3es. Rice says he can learn a lot from coming up against some of the Ajax tyros who excelled in the Champions League this season. In particular Frenkie de Jong, who is joining Barcelona this summer, is someone whose career Rice would like to emulate. \u201cYes, definitely, I want that,\u201d Rice said. \u201cHe\u2019s a top player and I think you\u2019ve seen that in the Champions League. When you start out in football you always want to play at the top. You want to play in the Champions League. If you were in football and you didn\u2019t want to do that there would be no point playing. De Jong has got his move to Barcelona and it\u2019s fully deserved. It would be great to come up against him in the Nations League.\u201d With a final against Portugal or Switzerland if England beat the Netherlands, the prospect of a trophy is real. But so is the possibility of disappointment for the second year in a row. Rice is adamant that winning the Nations League is vital if England want to continue their recent development. \u2018I think it\u2019s massive. It\u2019s really important,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ourselves into the semi-final. We\u2019ve got a massive chance now to create history. With the squad Gareth has put together, with the players that we have, for sure we\u2019ve got to be looking at the Nations League and winning it. It would stand us in good stead for the future and the Euros next year and the World Cup after that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
