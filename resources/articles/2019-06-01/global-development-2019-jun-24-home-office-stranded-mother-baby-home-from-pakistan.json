Nina Saleh has a Norwegian passport but full UK residency rights after living in London for 20 years. She was refused a visa to return home with baby Sofia three times, despite going through a stringent and lengthy adoption process in the UK with British authorities\u2019 involvement. Within 48 hours of the Guardian and others publishing her story, Saleh received news that the Home Office was overturning its decision and allowing her back home. Speaking from Karachi, where she has spent four months waiting for her case to be resolved, Saleh told the Guardian she had almost lost hope of ever getting home. \u201cJust this morning I was crying my eyes out. My friend who was also adopting here got her visa yesterday and was dreading telling me. We met through the adoption process, we were all in the same WhatsApp group. Obviously I was happy for her but I felt so upset for me and for Sofia. I was crying so much. I thought this would never end. \u201cThen my lawyer called and said it got overturned, and now I am so happy. \u201cThe media pressure was instrumental in getting this overturned. I think it\u2019s alarming how unprofessional the Home Office is. Since February they have stopped me from getting on with my life and I am left feeling still traumatised and highly vulnerable.\u201d Saleh\u2019s solicitor in the UK, Saimah Razzaq, at the Immigration Advice Service, told the Guardian earlier this week that the Home Office had been \u201cnegligent\u201d by not applying the correct regulations to let her come home. Saleh was originally refused on the basis that adoption is not allowed from Pakistan to the UK as there is no intra-country adoption agreement. However, couples or individuals coming from the UK use an established route of getting legal guardianship of the baby and then travelling back to Britain, where the authorities formalise the adoption process. Saleh says she is still angry with her treatment by the Home Office, who, she says, did not look properly at her three applications. \u201cI had a very stringent, lengthy process in the UK, led by UK social services. A social worker visited me at home for two hours a week, for a year. They knew I was coming here to Pakistan. The Department of Education, who have approved me for adoption, knew I was coming to Pakistan. \u201cIt\u2019s actually disgusting reading the letter they sent today. They have blamed me for using the word \u2018adoptive\u2019 mother when the adoption hasn\u2019t been finalised yet. But I had provided reams of evidence, detailing the legal process of guardianship in Pakistan.\u201d She told the Guardian that she believes she was refused a visa because of her status as an EEA national, despite having lived for so long in the UK. \u201cI believe I am being treated like a second-class citizen because I have Norwegian citizenship. The two other couples I travelled with, one British, one a mixed British-European national, both returned easily to the UK with their babies. \u201cYou know, I fought this for months but somebody else might not feel that brave. I expected delays or problems in Pakistan, but actually they were so professional this side. The Home Office was a complete shambles and totally unaccountable.\u201d Saleh expects to be home within two weeks, but her family, many of whom are in Norway, are already on their way to London. \u201cThey want to get everything ready for me. My mum is just overwhelmed.\u201d She still feels sad about what her family have missed over the first months of Sofia\u2019s life. \u201cMy mum turned 70 in April. I expected to be home way before then so \u2026 Sofia and I missed her birthday, and that is really sad.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
