That followed his opening win in similarly convincing fashion against the altogether different skills of Lukas Rosol on Monday. He added: \u201cI got myself in a situation that maybe I could have avoided if I had taken one or two of the set points that I had at 5-2 or 5-3. But I thought I did pretty well. There were some good points in there. That period of the match was very tough. I didn\u2019t play that well during that period and managed to come through it, thankfully, and play some good stuff in the second and third sets. \u201cI served at like 40, 42% first serves or something and still won in straight sets. I must have been doing things well other than serving. I was obviously hitting the ball pretty well and returning pretty good. But I could serve better, for sure. I only got broken once in a game where I had game points. It was all right.\u201d Murray said playing under the new roof provided some new challenges \u2013 not the least of them having to pick up the sound of the ball against the background of an echo in the cavernous stadium. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was too different to the other night when I played but, when the rain came, it was certainly loud. You can\u2019t hear anything, really. You could hear the line calls, but not so much the opponent\u2019s [shots] when he was hitting the ball or even when you\u2019re hitting the ball, really, which is tough purely because we\u2019re not used to it. That\u2019s what makes it challenging. \u201cWe use our ears when we play. It\u2019s not just the eyes. It helps us pick up the speed of the ball, the spin that\u2019s on the ball, how hard someone\u2019s hitting it. If we played with our ears covered or with headphones on, it would be a big advantage if your opponent wasn\u2019t wearing them. It\u2019s tricky. You know, you can still do it but it\u2019s harder, for sure. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely louder [than Wimbledon] but I don\u2019t think it changed the conditions on the court as much as it does at Wimbledon. \u201cWhen the roof is on, the humidity picks up significantly [at Wimbledon], whereas here it\u2019s always humid, even when the roof is open.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
