The five-time Super Bowl champion, who injured his right throwing hand during practice on Wednesday, had a chance to shed some light on what has become the biggest story of the week in New England but decided to keep everyone guessing. \u201cNot talking about it,\u201d Brady told reporters when asked how his hand felt. He repeated the same answer when asked if he threw a football at Friday\u2019s practice. Asked if he was confident that he would play against the visiting Jacksonville Jaguars, Brady simply said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Brady was listed as questionable when the Patriots released their final injury report on Friday afternoon, only fueling the intrigue. But Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone said he was not reading much into the storylines and fully expected the two-time NFL Most Valuable Player to feature on Sunday. \u201cTommy will play,\u201d Marrone said. \u201cWe know that.\u201d Various media reports said Brady injured his hand when a team mate ran into him at practice with 98.5 The Sports Hub\u2019s Michael Felger reporting he needed four stitches to close the cut on his hand. \u201cI heard it was a bloody mess but also that Brady\u2019s been throwing the ball well,\u201d NFL Network\u2019s Mike Garafolo tweeted. While the injury is not considered serious, Brady did not practice on Thursday and cancelled his media availability that day. Brady also gave away very little when asked if he had played in greater pain than he was currently experiencing. \u201cI\u2019ve played in a lot of games with pain,\u201d he said. Earlier, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick was just as tight-lipped when asked if Brady would be a game-time decision for Sunday, saying only: \u201cToday is Friday.\u201d Brady, the 40-year-old quarterback who was named to the Pro Bowl for a 13th time following another sterling campaign, has appeared on the defending champion Patriots\u2019 injury report since late in the regular season but has not missed a game due to injury since 2008. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to get ready for Jacksonville all the way through until game time,\u201d said Belichick. If Brady were unable to play on Sunday, Brian Hoyer would start at quarterback for the Patriots, who are in the AFC title game for a seventh straight season, the longest streak in the NFL since 1970. Hoyer remains the lone other signal-caller on the New England roster after the team dealt Jimmy Garoppolo to the San Francisco 49ers for a second-round draft pick earlier this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
