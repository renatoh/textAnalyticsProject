The surveillance video, first obtained by the CBS affiliate KOIN 6 News, shows the Parkrose high school football coach Keanon Lowe encountering Angel Granados-Diaz, then 18. While Lowe\u2019s actions in the May incident had been extensively reported, the video provided visual documentation of his quick thinking and compassion. KOIN said on its website it had obtained the video from the Multnomah county district attorney\u2019s office via a public records request. Other media outlets also obtained and published the video. \u201cIt is important to know we denied permission for this video,\u201d the school district superintendent, Michael Lopes-Serrao, said in an email to the Guardian. \u201cFirst, we believe it\u2019s a violation of Ferpa (the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) because this is part of a student\u2019s educational record. \u201cJust as important, this release of this footage has a significant negative impact on our students, staff, and families in Parkrose. We were not warned that KOIN had a copy of this video. We have asked KOIN to take it down. This was a very traumatic event for our community and the release of the video helps no one involved.\u201d The TV station declined to comment. The DA\u2019s office said: \u201cThe video was released yesterday afternoon pursuant to a public records request first submitted by KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon upon the adjudication of this case. We have no additional comment.\u201d The Guardian has removed the video from this article. At around noon on 17 May this year, Granados-Diaz walked on to campus, carrying a shotgun. He went into a classroom with the intent of killing himself, authorities said, not to kill other students, and did not aim the gun at anyone else. According to prior reports, Lowe, once a star wide receiver for the University of Oregon Ducks, said he was summoned to the fine arts building to get a student. \u201cThe door opens \u2013 I\u2019m within arm\u2019s length of the door, about 3ft away from the door, and there\u2019s a kid with a gun, a shotgun. In a fraction of a second, I analyzed everything really fast. \u201cI saw the look in his face, look in his eyes, looked at the gun, realized it was a real gun and then my instincts just took over. I lunged for the gun, put two hands on the gun. He had his two hands on the gun and obviously the kids are running out of the classroom and screaming.\u201d Lowe handed the firearm to a teacher and embraced Granados-Diaz. \u201cI just held him and told him that I was there to save him,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cI felt compassion for him; a lot of times, especially when you\u2019re young, you don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re doing until it\u2019s over.\u201d On 10 October, Granados-Diaz pleaded guilty to two charges of having a loaded gun in public. The gun was purchased legally, Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB) reported. Prosecutors and Granados-Diaz\u2019s lawyer insisted the incident was not a potential school shooting. The student made a suicidal remark before the incident and was drunk upon arriving at Parkrose, his lawyer said. \u201cThe evidence he was at Parkrose high school to commit suicide is overwhelming,\u201d said Adam Thayne, a defense attorney. \u201cIt is also overwhelming that he was there to hurt himself and nobody else.\u201d Granados-Diaz did not fire and only pointed the gun at himself. Under his plea agreement, he will be on probation for 36 months and undergo mental health and substance abuse treatment, OPB reported. \u201cI don\u2019t know if \u2018hero\u2019 is the right word but the universe works in mysterious ways and I was meant to be in that classroom and I was meant to stop a tragedy,\u201d Lowe recalled. Lowe, from the nearby city of Gresham, was employed as an offensive analyst for the San Francisco 49ers when he found out his best friend had died from a drug overdose. \u201cThat shattered my whole life. That changed everything,\u2019 he said, according to Oregonlive.com. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m going back.\u2019\u201d \u201cLife ain\u2019t about me, right? Life is about how I can help other people. So I came to help Parkrose. I came to change lives.\u201d In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 800-273-8255.
