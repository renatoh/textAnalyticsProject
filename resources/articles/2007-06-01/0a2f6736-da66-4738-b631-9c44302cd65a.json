Some may be tempted to regard this as junk mail about a junk job. This is a pointless contest for a meaningless position. So say many observers, usually misquoting 'Cactus Jack' Garner, the American Vice-President who described that office as not 'worth a pitcher of warm piss'. Roy Hattersley, speaking with the authority and expressing the frustration of someone who was deputy to Neil Kinnock in opposition for nine years, suggests that it is even more worthless than that. The competitors do not even know quite what position they are applying for. Alan Johnson thinks that whoever replaces John Prescott as deputy leader should also become Deputy Prime Minister. Jon Cruddas, making a virtue of his lack of ministerial experience, says he doesn't want to be DPM. Which is fortunate, because Gordon Brown wouldn't give him the position anyway. It will be entirely within Mr Brown's power to decide not to have a Deputy Prime Minister. There is also nothing in either the British constitution or that of the Labour party to prevent him from ignoring the vote and selecting his own DPM. That wily survivor, Jack Straw, manager of the Chancellor's leadership 'campaign', would be the obvious candidate for DPM if Mr Brown doesn't like the look of whoever the party elects. It may prove to be telling that, with Tony Blair absent abroad and with John Prescott on his sick bed, it was Mr Straw who chaired last Thursday's cabinet. And yet, when all that is said, this is still a vote that matters and a position of significance. The job counts and so does the contest for it. It has meaning, first, because the campaign and the result will send a message to the country about the state of the Labour party. On the positive side, this contest has not turned into the fratricidal bloodbath which Labour has so often excelled at in the past. John Reid, who is backing Hazel Blears, has taken a lump out of Peter Hain by accusing the Northern Ireland Secretary of manufacturing a row over anti-terrorism measures in order to promote his deputy leadership ambitions. But there has been a notable absence of personal venom between the competitors - in public, at any rate. Though the candidates have staked out some differing positions - that is, after all, the point of such contests - they have not exposed a huge ideological chasm within the Labour party. Labour MPs report to me convincingly that they have been having good-natured debates within their constituency parties about whom to nominate. One Yorkshire MP even goes as far as calling it 'civilised, refreshing and cathartic'. The generally comradely content of the contest has confounded those who predicted that all the demons - a civil war even - would be unleashed by the departure of Tony Blair. The candidates often agree to the point of banality. Nice Hilary Benn says: 'Winning the next election will depend on broadening our support.' It sure will, Hilary. They all say that Labour must talk to its members, try to reconnect with the country and communicate more honestly. Well, even Peter Mandelson now says there has been too much spin. Jon Cruddas has fashioned his campaign around the need to recover the lost support of working-class voters in constituencies such as his own in east London. Hazel Blears, the most unabashedly Blairite of the candidates, warns that 'throwback politics' will cost them the support of aspirational voters. Both are right. Labour has lost millions of its traditional supporters; Labour cannot win another election unless it continues to appeal to the more affluent constituencies of Middle Britain. It needs to reconstruct the coalition of heartland Labour and New Labour that first put this government into power. And this is where the candidates are so far failing. They have yet to produce a plausible account of how exactly that immense task is going to be achieved. Often acute in their analysis of where Labour has gone wrong, all the candidates are still struggling to produce the prescription for the government's revival. Between them, they have yet to fashion one strikingly original and sound new policy, even a single memorable phrase. As one astute former minister puts it: 'We have not found our next generation of communicators.' All of them have been using unBlairish words such as 'equality' and even 'socialism'. All of them have been, to lesser and greater degrees, making noises and striking postures somewhere to the left of Tony Blair, to the dismay of the outgoing Prime Minister and to some concern in the camp of Gordon Brown, who felt compelled to slap them down at a hustings in Leicester by saying there would be no 'retreat to the soft options'. The surprise is that anyone is at all surprised by this. The candidates for deputy are attempting to win a Labour election. By its nature, this is a body of opinion which is going to be more left wing than the country. The most shameless grovelling has been for the votes of trades unionists, an auction in which even the Blairista Hazel Blears has indulged. Only Alan Johnson, a former union leader, has not succumbed to the temptation. Smart trades unionists will ignore whatever they are promised by these wannabe deputies because Gordon Brown is simply not going to begin his premiership by turning the clock back on reform of union law. The other reason they have tilted to the left of Tony Blair is because, in Labour party terms, it would be very difficult to find space to the right of the departing Prime Minister. The Labour hustings do not ring to the sound of activists demanding to know which candidate will pursue public-service reform most aggressively or clamouring for pledges to go to war again. By my rough reckoning, Labour's centre of gravity is currently somewhere around the position occupied by the late Robin Cook. Had he lived to enter this contest, the former Foreign Secretary would have been very hard to beat. It is not shocking that two of the candidates - Jon Cruddas and Harriet Harman - say that they regret voting for the Iraq war when nearly everyone who has ever sat in the Blair cabinets now regards it as an absolute disaster. Peter Hain has set the pace when it comes to attacking the excesses of the super-rich. He probably thought he was being daringly radical when he denounced gargantuan City bonuses and attacked asset-stripping by private equity firms. Outrage about their behaviour turns out to be shared even in the City itself. The boss of one of the biggest private equity funds told the Financial Times a few days ago that it can't be right that executives in the buy-out business can pay lower tax rates than their office cleaners. Had one of the Labour deputy leadership candidates put it that way, he or she would have been denounced in some quarters as a dangerous Trot from the lunatic shores of the raving left. I hear them saying that the super-rich should make a fairer contribution; I do not hear them explaining exactly how. They may be unshackled from having to be slavishly loyal to Tony Blair, but they are all looking nervously over their shoulders at Gordon Brown. The head of a private equity firm can be ruder about his own industry than candidates for the Labour deputy leadership. For them directly to attack the tax privileges of the super-rich would mean criticising the man who has been Chancellor for the past decade and will be Prime Minister in a few weeks' time. Which brings me to the second reason why this contest is important: the relationship between the deputy and the new occupant of Number 10. Since Gordon Brown is being crowned without a contest, whoever becomes his deputy will be the only person elected to a leadership position in the Labour party for 13 years. That ought to give the deputy an elevated platform for his or her agenda and a special authority in dealing with colleagues, including the leader. Roy Hattersley contends that the job is worthless, but his own career demonstrates why it is not. His trenchant critiques of the government have always carried more saliency because he speaks with the credibility derived from having been the party's deputy leader. John Prescott may be widely regarded as a laughing stock, but Tony Blair never dared to treat his deputy as a joke because election made Mr Prescott the one member of the cabinet who could never be fired. All the candidates naturally want to suggest that they will be complementary to Mr Brown. Alan Johnson reckons he'd be 'a good Robin to Gordon's Batman'. Mr Johnson has several attractive qualities and among them is his ability to speak human and his sense of humour. But this is a line he should drop. I cannot be alone in shuddering at the image of him and Gordon Brown wearing tights. Harriet Harman says she'd be 'Radio 2 to Gordon's Radio 4'. I am still trying to work out what that means. Ms Harman, who has strong backing from the Brown machine, has a history which points up the dilemma. She can fairly claim to have played a large role in bringing family policy from the periphery of politics to its centre, not least by convincing Mr Brown that he needed to take issues like childcare seriously. Against that, it was her failure to stand up to him over cuts to lone parent benefits that destroyed her as a cabinet minister in the first year of the government's life. A mandate of his or her own gives the deputy a unique capacity to tell the leader the truths that no one else will dare confront him with. None of the candidates has so far made a convincing case that they would be able to tell the Great Clunking Fist things that he did not want to hear. The usual formula is that they would offer 'public loyalty and private honesty' to the next Prime Minister. That is exactly how Tony Blair describes his relationship with George W Bush."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
