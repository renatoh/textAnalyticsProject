The Silicon Valley giant has pulled out all the stops to promote the service, which launches in 100 countries on Friday, with the stars of its flagship new series The Morning Show, Jennifer Aniston and Reece Witherspoon, spearheading the publicity push on both sides of the Atlantic. Apple has earmarked about $6bn (\u00a34.6bn) to produce original programming over the the next few years \u2013 compared to the BBC\u2019s annual TV budget of \u00a31.7bn \u2013 but its library will be just a fraction the size of Netflix and Amazon which spend a combined $20bn annually. The phone and computer giant, however, is aiming to be a prestige brand, akin to the strategy employed successfully for decades by Game of Thrones to Chernobyl-maker HBO. Apple has paid $240m for two series of the Morning Show comedy drama - Aniston\u2019s first TV series since leaving Friends - and hopes to attract fans by releasing fewer, high quality original shows than the Netflix juggernaut. The new service hasn\u2019t exactly got off to a flying start with the first four shows released to critics \u2013 including the $15m-per-episode sci-fi See with Jason Momoa and Dickinson, a comedy drama about a young Emily Dickinson \u2013 receiving pretty average reviews. To counter the lack of content firepower, Apple has a two-pronged strategy. It will offer the cheapest service \u2013 at \u00a34.99 it is significantly cheaper than Netflix\u2019s most popular UK tariff of \u00a38.99 \u2013 and it will give it away for free for a year to customers who buy a new Apple device, which includes more than 100m new iPhones every year in the US and Europe alone. But the potential total market is huge: there are about 900m iPhones in use around the world and 500m other Apple devices. \u201cThey have come to the video market very late and Netflix really has stolen a march,\u201d says Neil Campling, head of global technology, media and telecoms at Mirabaud Securities. \u201cThey are pricing it very cutely as they are aware that their offering is probably substandard in a very crowded market. Giving it away for free will to a degree mask whether it is seen as a success or failure in the first couple of years.\u201d Netflix, which earlier this year raised its prices in major markets including the US and UK, is already beginning to feel the heat. Campling believes 2019 could mark the first time in the company\u2019s 22 history that it adds fewer new subscribers than the previous year. Nevertheless, with a $15bn annual budget Netflix has plenty of content firepower to unleash as new rivals emerge. This month will see the return of The Crown, a flagship series for the service and its fans, as well as Martin Scorsese\u2019s potential Oscar contender The Irishman, which stars Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. In less than two weeks\u2019 time Disney will make its move into streaming with Disney+ due to debut in the US and Netherlands on 12 November. The world\u2019s biggest entertainment company is flexing its content muscles on day one with the debut of the $100m Star Wars live action TV series, The Mandalorian. No launch date has yet been set for the UK because Disney still has TV and movie licensing deals in place for its content to air on Sky. Disney\u2019s vast content library \u2013 from the Marvel universe, Pixar films, family fare from Toy Story to Frozen and TV hits such as The Simpsons \u2013 make it arguably the biggest threat among the new wave of streaming launches. It\u2019s also priced to pull in viewers: in the US it will be $6.99 a month, almost half the cost of Netflix\u2019s most popular US package of $12.99 and not much more than Apple. Other new streaming services are coming soon. By the end of the year ITV and the BBC will introduce Britbox, a \u00a35.99-a-month offer that promises a best-of-British experience from Victoria to Love Island. Next year there will be two more: HBO Max (which won\u2019t be launching in the UK) and NBC Universal\u2019s Peacock, leading to a growing belief that consumers are heading towards subscription streaming burnout. Analysts believe that overall, including traditional pay-TV, the number of services viewers will be willing to pay for will settle at three to five. \u201cPeople can only watch so much and I believe that we\u2019re on the edge of multiple subscription fatigue,\u201d says Henry Daglish, chief executive of media agency Bountiful Cow. \u201cI think they will find it much harder than they think it might be.\u201d Apple\u2019s cheaper price point is a way of building an audience quickly, according to Tom Harrington, a senior research analyst at Enders Analysis. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to get to scale very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re basically giving it away for free. Apple wants to make the app a destination and once you\u2019re there you sign up for third-party subscription and then Apple takes a cut. It\u2019s a gateway to entertainment.\u201d Netflix\u2019s recent missed subscriber targets are not a positive sign for Apple, according to Harrington, who says for UK users, Apple TV+ will be an additional bonus or secondary streaming service \u2013 not something that replaces Netflix. \u201cThey\u2019ve got scale, they\u2019re making more than anyone else, they understand what shows work in streaming \u2013 more than anyone else does,\u201d he says of Netflix. \u201cBut in developed markets like the US and the UK, growth is difficult and if growth is slowing for Netflix, and you\u2019re coming in and being supplementary to them, it\u2019s going to be hard for you.\u201d Cost of major streaming services Netflix standard tier: \u00a38.99 a month, \u00a3108 annually Content Stranger Things, The Crown Amazon Prime (based on cheaper annual tariff) \u00a36.58, \u00a379 Content Good Omens, Man in the High Castle, The Grand Tour New launches: Britbox \u00a35.99, \u00a372 Content Love Island, Gavin &amp; Stacey, Victoria Disney+ \u00a35.99, \u00a372 Content Star Wars, Avengers, The Simpson, Avatar AppleTV+ \u00a34.99, \u00a360 Content The Morning Show, See, Dickinson plus shows from Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg HBO Max $15, $180 Content Friends (US only, for now), Big Little Lies, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, the DC universe including Batman and Superman NBC Universal \u00a37, \u00a384 (estimated) Content US version of The Office, films such as Jurassic Park and Fast and the Furious"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
