He had been withdrawn from the action a couple of minutes earlier and he was already weeping with exhaustion and relief. He knew that the shadows that have darkened his life for the past four years had finally been dispersed and that life as he had known it before that dreadful evening in Paris could finally resume. In the end it turned out to be one of the better finals, worthy of the occasion and the hype, but for almost the first 20 minutes yesterday every Brazilian outfield player appeared to have been struck by a recurrence of whatever nervous affliction turned Ronaldo into a zombie four years ago. A World Cup that began with an act of revolution when Senegal beat France was in danger of ending in the anticlimax of a victory for a workmanlike Germany. In all areas of the pitch during that period Brazil were coming second to white-shirted men who sliced open the flanks at will and continually relaunched themselves by gobbling up the second ball. At this stage Brazil were being kept alive by their much maligned trio of central defenders. But then, very slowly, the real Ronaldo began to appear before our eyes and the match started to assume its proper shape. At the start he had been as tentative and imprecise as his team-mates. Three good chances went begging in the first half and for a while it seemed hideously possible that fate might be repeating itself. But when he finally scored, the way he did it - the intuitive dart to reach the rebound off Kahn's chest for 1-0 after 67 minutes, the calm touch to bring the ball under control before doubling the lead 12 minutes later - spoke of renewed self-belief. With eight goals from this tournament Ronaldo has become the first man since Paolo Rossi in 1982 to win both the Golden Boot and a champion's medal at the tournament. He now has 12 World Cup goals in all, which puts him level with Pele and just behind Gerd M\u00fcller of Germany, the leader with 14, and Just Fontaine of France, whose 13 goals were amassed in one tournament. And, at 25, Ronaldo has at least one more World Cup - perhaps two, with luck - left in him. \"I'm slowly realising just what happened. My happiness and my emotion are so great that it's difficult to understand,\" he said afterwards. \"I've said before that my big victory was to play football again, to run again and to score goals again. This victory, for our fifth world title, has crowned my recovery and the work of the whole team. More than anything it's a victory for the group. The whole team ran and battled and helped each other. No individual conquest can beat what the group achieved.\" G\u00e9rard Saillant, the French surgeon who operated on his abused knee, was in the crowd as the guest of his patient. \"This gives hope to everyone who is injured,\" Saillant said, \"even those who aren't sportsmen, to see that by fighting you can make it. He's back to where he was; it's hugely satisfying and I am very moved.\" In the view of Luiz Felipe Scolari, Brazil's coach, the final turned out to be a victory for individual players within a team game. \"What made a big difference was the individual quality of each player,\" he said. \"At certain times that was the factor that gave us superiority.\" Not surprisingly Scolari praised the work of Lucio, Edmilson and Roque Junior in the centre of the defence. Edmilson, having been badly elbowed in the face early on by an unpunished Miroslav Klose, limped through the match after a collision in the 22nd minute. His mobility was impaired but he continued to exude tranquillity. \"The defence was so heavily criticised and it was not that bad,\" Scolari said. \"Maybe it's the best defence in the world.\" The last laugh A gift for ironic understatement was not among the coach's advertised qualities when he took the job two years ago with instructions to pull the disintegrating qualification campaign back together. Instead his militaristic tendencies were more widely noted. But, although Brazil used 77 players and four coaches to reach the finals, and suffered six defeats on the way, the signs of an improvement were present even before they arrived in the Far East. Now Scolari has enjoyed the last laugh over those who campaigned for his removal. He has also earned the undying affection of the Brazilian people by producing an expressive squad that appears to conform in most respects to the ideals of the old days. It is a pity they were given no chance in Japan to test the belief that they may be a genuinely great side. For that they need great opposition, something that was not always easily visible in this tournament. Germany were not that opposition, not by a long way. Their route to Yokohama was perhaps the easiest ever travelled by World Cup finalists. After the demolition of Saudi Arabia only the Republic of Ireland's last-gasp equaliser interrupted the string of parsimonious victories over Cameroon, Paraguay, the United States and South Korea. Nor in moral terms did they deserve victory yesterday, at least not since Michael Ballack publicly lamented his absence from the final through suspension by comparing his plight to that of Laurent Blanc four years ago. Blanc, some will remember, lost his chance of a World Cup winner's medal after being sent off when Slaven Bilic of Croatia mimed a reaction to a non-existent infringement. His suspension was a terrible miscarriage of justice. Ballack's, however, was fully justified, since it came after he had intentionally fouled a South Korean opponent in order to preserve Germany's advantage. V\u00f6ller's defence of his player's decision to commit the foul merely added another bad smell to the tournament. Yesterday Ronaldo and the rest of Scolari's team - even Rivaldo, the artist with the morals of a pickpocket - blew the stench away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
