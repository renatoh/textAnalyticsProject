Speaking to the Guardian in the south-west London seat of Putney, the Labour leader claimed he had instructed frontbench colleagues to fall into line, after divisions over Brexit sparked a furious row over whether to go for an election. \u201cI just said, \u2018look, this debate is now over. We\u2019ve done it, the party has now made its decision, and that\u2019s it; and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to campaign on\u2019,\u201d he said, describing last week\u2019s shadow cabinet meeting. Speaking after a campaign visit to a social housing development, an uncharacteristically assertive Corbyn also said he had made a unilateral decision to back Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to trigger a 12 December general election \u2013 despite the vocal objections of several colleagues, including Labour\u2019s chief whip, Nick Brown. \u201cI put it to them quite clearly: I said, our objections are now gone. We are now supporting a general election \u2013 and everybody gulped. I didn\u2019t alert anybody in advance \u2013 it was my decision. On my own. I made that decision. And they gulped, and said, Yes Jeremy.\u201d Labour\u2019s stance on Brexit has shifted significantly over the past 12 months, and the party now says it would seek to negotiate a new deal with Brussels \u2013 including a closer trading relationship \u2013 within three months, and put it to the public in a referendum within six. Several members of the shadow cabinet, including Keir Starmer, have suggested they would campaign for remain in that referendum, and Emily Thornberry recently described Labour as a \u201cremain party\u201d; but Corbyn has insisted any decision on Labour\u2019s position will not be taken until after the election. The detailed content of Labour\u2019s manifesto will not be taken until the \u201cclause V\u201d meeting of senior Labour decision-makers, expected to take place next weekend. But Corbyn insisted the Brexit policy decided at the party\u2019s conference in Brighton, which saw a remain-supporting motion defeated by trade unions and constituency delegates, must stand. \u201cI don\u2019t see why the clause V meeting would want to change anything, because my whole strategy has been to try and keep the party, the movement and the country together,\u201d he said. His robust stance echoed a piece written by union leaders including Unite general secretary Len McCluskey in the New Statesman, which called on shadow cabinet members to \u201ckeep their powder dry\u201d. The union leaders, including Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) and Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, alongside McCluskey, said, \u201cLabour\u2019s policy is scarcely going to maintain credibility if the very shadow cabinet members who would, in government, be responsible for negotiating a departure deal with the EU announce now that they will campaign for its public rejection. This is the politics of posturing, and not a serious approach to a pressing problem.\u201d The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has made stopping Brexit the centrepiece of her party\u2019s pitch to the country. But Corbyn said Labour\u2019s aim was to transform Britain. \u201cThis election is about the future of this country. It\u2019s about the environment. It\u2019s about the cohesion of society. We can\u2019t go on with austerity, poverty, inequality and injustice. We need a government that\u2019s committed to reversing that. And we are the ones to do that.\u201d With veterans of the combative Vote Leave campaign running Boris Johnson\u2019s bid for five more years in Downing Street, attacks on Corbyn\u2019s character are likely to feature heavily. But the Labour leader insisted he was undaunted. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of mud thrown at me for a long time, and it doesn\u2019t stick. I don\u2019t care. I know what I believe, I know what we\u2019re doing, I know what our policies are. If they throw personal stuff at me, it says more about them than me. They go low, we go high,\u201d he said. Asked whether he would attack Johnson\u2019s character, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not doing personal. I don\u2019t do personal. It doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Corbyn was speaking after a visit to Clyde House \u2013 a social housing block in Putney, where residents have fought a long-running grassroots campaign against their landlords, with the help of Labour community organisers. Sitting on a sofa in a chronically overheated flat, he listened while tenants detailed their struggles to get broken lifts fixed and tackle damp, mould and shattered glass. Labour has announced that it will spend up to \u00a360bn upfront on retro-fitting existing homes with insulation and clean energy sources, in a \u201cwarm homes\u201d pledge. Corbyn said he believed the policy helped to show how Labour\u2019s \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d could be a vote winner. \u201cMy offer is: we will insulate your home, we will save you \u00a3400 a year on your bills, and we will create jobs, in fitting those homes, and manufacturing the sustainable energy sources,\u201d he said. And he insisted such policies would have appeal beyond allotment-tending north Londoners like himself, describing tackling the climate crisis as a \u201cclass issue\u201d. \u201cIt is a class issue \u2013 when it\u2019s working-class communities that have the lowest life expectancy, the highest levels of pollution, the least efficient homes and the highest energy bills \u2013 whereas the wealthier middle-classes have cleaner air, longer lives, and much better insulated homes. And it\u2019s the poorest children who eat the worst food, and have the greatest problems of obesity as a result of it,\u201d he said. Labour is kicking off the campaign significantly behind Johnson\u2019s Conservatives in the national polls, and with the risk of the Lib Dems dividing the remain vote. The Tories are banking on winning a string of Labour-held seats, particularly in Brexit-voting areas, with a tough stance on law and order, and by painting Corbyn as a threat to national security. Asked whether he could promise voters that he would protect them and their families, the Labour leader said: \u201cWhat is real security in your life? Real security is somewhere to live, real security is a secure job, real security is a health service, real security is social care, real security is knowing that you can bring up your children in a safe, clean, sustainable environment.\u201d Pressed on whether he was prepared for the \u201c3am call,\u201d waking a prime minister to warn Britain is under imminent threat, he said: \u201cOf course: absolutely. You have to take decisions at times like that. The principle behind it will be sustainable peace, will be human rights, will be justice.\u201d Corbyn also rejected the idea that Jewish voters have anything to fear from a Labour government, after the Jewish Labour Movement said it would barely campaign for the party during the general election, amid concerns over its handling of reports of antisemitism among members and supporters. \u201cAntisemitism and racism is an evil within our society. I\u2019ve done everything to confront it throughout my life, and will always do so. We want this country to be safe for all people. An attack on a synagogue, an attack on a mosque, an attack on a church \u2013 an attack on a person walking down the street because they\u2019re perceived to be different from the rest of us \u2013 we simply can\u2019t tolerate it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
