The lawyers, at worst, face being referred to their bar associations for possible disciplinary action. This could result in a reprimand or even disbarment, ending any further legal career on the part of once high-flying government lawyers. The justice department has been conducting an inquiry into the role of the lawyers who wrote the now infamous memos giving the go-ahead for the CIA to use waterboarding, which simulates drowning, and other techniques such as slamming detainees against false walls and prolonged sleep deprivation. Waterboarding, which Obama calls torture but which Bush administration claim is not, was used against suspected al-Qaida members. The justice department inquiry is now close to completion. This emerged yesterday when the department wrote to a Congressional committee informing them that a deadline for comment on the draft report had passed on Sunday. The draft report of the inquiry was completed in December but publication was delayed to give those involved a chance to respond. The release of the Bush administration torture memos by Obama last month opened an intense debate in Washington and the country at large. Bush administration politicians and officials objected to the release of the memos, as did the CIA. Human rights groups called for punishment of those involved. Obama appeared torn, at one point opening the door to prosecution of the lawyers and then apparently retreating for fear of becoming bogged down in a prolonged row. He passed on responsibility, saying it was a matter for the justice department inquiry, not the president. Officials who claim to have seen the draft conclusions of the inquiry told the US media that though the lawyers may have been guilty of serious lapses of judgement, they should not face criminal prosecution. The 220-page report focuses on three lawyers who worked in the justice department's office of legal counsel during the Bush administration: John Yoo, Jay Bybee and Steven Bradbury. Bybee is a judge, Yoo is a professor at the University of California-Berkeley and Bradbury returned to private practice when Bush left office. Former US attorney Roscoe Howard, speaking to National Public Radio on the likelihood they will not face criminal prosecution, suggested it was hard to put a criminal case together: \"You'd have to have some sort of information that those three guys understood that the memo was in itself just garbage. I'd be looking for something that shows they understood what they wrote was just unsupportable, but they decided they were going to write it anyway.\" The conclusions of the inquiry, which could be made public before the end of the month, provide details of how the torture memos came to be written, including the email exchanges of the lawyers involved, Bush officials at the White House and the CIA. Obama administration officials, who have banned waterboarding and other techniques, have said several times they are reluctant to re-open issues that happened in the past, preferring to keep the focus on its hefty domestic and foreign policy agenda. But human rights groups say that the techniques approved for use by the CIA were contrary to US law. Techniques such as waterboarding had been condemned by the US when used by North Korea against captured US soldiers in the 1950s. The former vice-president, Dick Cheney, criticised Obama for releasing the memos and claimed that other still secret memos would show that the techniques helped secure valuable intelligence that save US lives. But Obama, at a press conference last week, said he had seen the memos referred to by Cheney and there was nothing to suggest that he information could not have been obtained by methods other than the harsh techniques used by the CIA."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
