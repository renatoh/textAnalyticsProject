Theresa is tough, too, but the dragons are very different\u2019", "bodyText": "Of all the people who sit in her cabinet, Damian Green has known the Supreme Leader for the longest. They first met four decades ago when they were students at Oxford and no one but Theresa May thought she could end up running the country. \u201cEver since Theresa became prime minister, people have asked me, \u2018What\u2019s she really like?\u2019 And the answer I give is, \u2018What you see is what you get\u2019. She\u2019s hardworking, conscientious \u2013 as a student she had a sort of sense of public duty, and was incredibly determined and calm.\u201d The \u201cincredibly determined\u201d is the key phrase in that sentence. It points to the ferocious drive that kept his friend in the Tory game over the many years when no one else took her seriously as a potential prime minister. That determination then powered her to the throne over the prostrate bodies of the Tory boys. If the polls are anywhere near correct, she will gain a renewed lease on No 10 on 8 June. And then what? The precise nature of Mayism is a topic of renewed debate since she launched a Tory manifesto whose intellectual influences appear to include Edmund Burke, William Beveridge and Ed Miliband. How has her philosophy of Conservatism evolved over the years that he has known her? \u201cIn 40 years, certainly I\u2019d hope everyone would evolve \u2013 but mostly she responds to the facts that are put in front of her and applies a very strong sense of right and wrong to the circumstances that she\u2019s presented with,\u201d says the work and pensions secretary. \u201cShe\u2019s always been like that.\u201d Green thinks that his wife, who was at Oxford at the same time and was the young Theresa Brasier\u2019s tutorial partner, has a good explanation of what makes the Tory leader tick. \u201cAlicia makes the point that they read geography; they weren\u2019t your classic Oxford PPE graduate that goes into politics, like me. And what geographers were trained to do was assemble their own evidence. You know, they went out and collected rainfall statistics at six in the morning. They don\u2019t discuss political theory, they go out and get evidence and on the basis of that evidence they construct what needs to be done. And Theresa has always been like that.\u201d The Tory manifesto declared a belief in the power of government to do good, not something you much heard from David Cameron and never from Margaret Thatcher. Is it fair to say that May is the first properly post-Thatcher leader that the Tories have had? Green says it is not fruitful to \u201ctalk about Margaret Thatcher\u2019s political philosophy\u201d, an observation that will not go down well with the many Tories who still subscribe to the Thatcherite creed. \u201cThe world is not the same now as it was in the mid-1970s, the priorities for government are not the same. One of the things that\u2019s happened to politics is a lot of the old certainties have gone and the ability to place someone on the left/right spectrum is more difficult than it used to be. \u201cThose few politicians that are straightforwardly ideological now look out of date. It\u2019s perfectly easy to place Jeremy Corbyn on an ideological spectrum, on the far left, because all of his views were formed a long time ago and none of them have changed. It\u2019s more difficult with someone like Theresa, who does react to the modern world. \u201cAttempting to put her in a Thatcherite or non-Thatcherite mould is pointless because the world has moved on so much. The similarity is that Mrs Thatcher saw dragons to be slain and was a tough-minded woman who succeeded. Theresa is a tough-minded woman who succeeds, but there are completely different dragons to be slain.\u201d The enemies Thatcher identified were all to her left. May\u2019s selection of dragons includes corporate excess. \u201cThe phrase she uses is \u2018burning injustices\u2019 and those burning injustices are indeed places where the pure free market isn\u2019t working for large numbers of people. It\u2019s always been part of the Conservative tradition that it is not a libertarian free-markets-at-all-costs party.\u201d State interventions, such as capping energy tariffs, are not to the liking of many Tory MPs and donors. The City is frothing with complaint. \u201cI would say to them that if you value something and want to preserve it, you have to be prepared to reform it.\u201d So is this the idea \u2013 May wants to save capitalism from itself? \u201cReforming capitalism is a permanent task for the Conservative party and the Conservative party is at its best when it is reforming.\u201d The domestic agenda is dwarfed by the challenge of extricating Britain from the EU. \u201cThis will be one of the most momentous half-decades that Britain will have known, because we\u2019ve got the Brexit negotiations. Getting those right is the overwhelming task facing the next government and it is our central proposition at this election \u2013 that given this huge historic task, you\u2019ve got a pretty stark choice of leaders.\u201d Green spent the referendum forecasting disaster for Britain if the country was reckless enough to quit the EU. \u201cThere are two things you can do if you were a Remainer, as I was. You can either say, \u2018OK, we argued the case, we lost, so now what\u2019s best for the country?\u2019 Or you can continue trying to play games, to say it didn\u2019t really happen. It seems to me overwhelmingly more sensible and more in the interests of this country to say the best thing to do now is to make sure the government gets the best deal to establish the close and special relationship our manifesto talks about. \u201cWe have, if you look back on our 40-odd years of membership, been a pretty truculent housemate from the point of view of the others. It may well be that it will be more comfortable for everyone all round that we remain close friends but we\u2019re living in different houses, as it were.\u201d He accepts that any deal will entail a continuing financial contribution. \u201cThere may well be projects we want to participate in. It would only be reasonable to expect us to contribute to those because they will be projects of ongoing benefit.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt would be preferable, massively preferable, to have a good deal than not a deal.\u201d Green, unlike many of his colleagues, is willing to acknowledge it isn\u2019t simply going to be a case of Britain making demands. Any deal will involve give as well as take. \u201cNo negotiation has ever succeeded without an element of compromise and no compromise ever satisfies everyone 100 per cent. I am sure all sensible people recognise there is a deal to be done that is mutually beneficial. But, you know, it\u2019s not easy. As Theresa said, this is going to be a difficult negotiation, there will be bumps in the road.\u201d What if there is no deal? \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a deal \u2026 and don\u2019t preserve the frictionless borders that we want and the market access we want, then there will be problems for this country. She \u2013 we \u2013 very much want a deal.\u201d In her attempt to broaden the Tory appeal, May has been promising \u201ca country that works for everyone\u201d. Green says this is a pitch to \u201cpeople who were \u2018just about managing\u2019 who may have felt that the world was passing them by and had become unfair. We are trying very hard to include everyone in what will be growing prosperity.\u201d The Tories plan to maintain a freeze on working-age benefits, a legacy of the Cameron-Obsorne era that May has not disavowed. That freeze will take a big bite out of the living standards of millions. Doesn\u2019t this give the lie to all the fine words about doing more for the \u201cjust about managing\u201d? \u201cI don\u2019t think it does because what our welfare policy is all about is encouraging more people into work.\u201d But that\u2019s an answer to a different question. We remind the work and pensions secretary that the question was about people already in jobs who face a continuing freeze of their benefits. He can\u2019t dispute that this very large group will suffer under the Tories? \u201cWell,\u201d he swerves, \u201cyou are assuming everyone\u2019s situation stays the same. What I\u2019m about is helping as many people get into work if they\u2019re not in work, or if they are in work, to progress so they can have more control over their own lives.\u201d Another answer to a different question. If May is returned to No 10 with an enlarged majority, it will be regarded, not least by herself, as a very personal mandate. She called this early election even though some of her closest colleagues, Green among them, were very sceptical. She has been utterly dominant in the Tory campaign, to the near-exclusion of the rest of the cabinet. What might a big majority mean for the way she runs the government? Ministers and civil servants already describe her regime as the most centralised and autocratic in living memory. \u201cAs far as I can see, every prime minister is the most autocratic prime minister ever for people working for them,\u201d Green shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve been around long enough to know that everyone says that about all prime ministers. To return to the point I made at the start about Theresa, she works on evidence and if you present a good case, then she will listen.\u201d Has he ever changed her mind? \u201cI\u2019ve certainly persuaded her of policies that I thought were very important.\u201d Give us an example. \u201cI\u2019m not going to repeat private conversations that took place inside the Home Office. Because, you know, she is very keen on proper behaviour.\u201d And she is also, as everyone from the Police Federation to dissenting colleagues have learned to their cost, a woman you cross at your extreme peril? He smiles: \u201cTheresa is a very tough individual.\u201d Ruthless? \u201cTough. She\u2019s a tough individual,\u201d he says, very, very carefully."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
