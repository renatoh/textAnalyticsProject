Hunt, who is now foreign secretary, has pitched himself as the \u201cserious leader\u201d the UK needs in the Conservative party leadership race, arguing that he is the best negotiator to deliver Brexit. Kay said he was sending his memoirs to MPs because he \u201cwanted to remind those \u2018honourable friends\u2019 with any honour quite what those in the health service actually thought of those \u2018negotiation skills\u2019 Mr Hunt has been boasting about\u2019. Speaking on Wednesday, Kay said: \u201cIf a week is a long time in politics then the 11 months since Jeremy Hunt left the NHS in tatters must be a generation ago. Much as I don\u2019t want to be complicit in a world where we have prime minister Johnson, I can\u2019t sit back and watch Hunt\u2019s record on health go somehow unmentioned.\u201d Hunt, who was health secretary between 2012 and 2018, clashed with junior doctors in 2015 and 2016 over a new contract that sought, among other things, to extend doctors\u2019 normal working week hours to include Saturdays and weekday evenings from 7pm until 10pm. The bitter dispute led to strike action across the NHS. \u201cIt was his actions \u2013 forcing an unfair and unsafe contract on the junior doctors and then leading a misinformation campaign when they fought against it \u2013 that led me to dig out my junior doctor diaries and have them published,\u201d said Kay, lambasting Hunt as \u201cthe biggest villain of them all\u201d for \u201chacking back at NHS funding, driving overworked staff to breaking point, leaving us with over 100,000 vacancies, then watching unflinchingly as his actions saw every imaginable waiting time soar, from ambulance call-outs to oncology appointments.\u201d A former junior doctor, Kay left medicine in 2010 and is now a comedian and author. He ends his 2017 memoirs with an open letter to Hunt, challenging him to work a shift alongside junior doctors. \u201cPalliate a cancer patient; watch a trauma victim have their leg amputated; deliver a dead baby,\u201d Kay writes. \u201cBecause I defy any human being, even you, to know what the job really entails and question a single doctor\u2019s motivation. If you knew, you would be applauding them, you\u2019d be proud of them, you\u2019d be humbled by them, and you\u2019d be eternally grateful for everything they do. The way you treat junior doctors demonstrably doesn\u2019t work. I strongly suggest you seek a second opinion.\u201d After This is Going to Hurt hit the top of book charts, and readers began sending copies to Hunt, the then health secretary invited Kay in for a meeting, at which the pair discussed the junior doctors\u2019 dispute, the number of junior doctors leaving their jobs and the rise in infant mortality. It did not go well. \u201cHe admitted he\u2019d failed to communicate properly and said how deeply he regretted that strikes ever took place. My turn. I asked him: \u2018If you could go back in time, what would you do differently?\u2019\u201d Kay wrote in the Mirror. \u201cHe insisted he wouldn\u2019t change anything he did at all, so I guess we have rather different ideas about \u2018regret\u2019.\u201d On the staffing crisis, Hunt denied to Kay that there had been a significant increase in junior doctors leaving the profession. \u201cI offered the latest official statistics showing only half of them now continue after their first two years, a huge change from past years. \u2018I don\u2019t recognise those figures.\u2019 he said. About official figures,\u201d wrote Kay. The initiative follows a tweet from Kay earlier this week in which he asked his followers: \u201cHow much is it going to cost me to send a copy of This Is Going to Hurt to every Conservative member who might vote for Jeremy Hunt?\u201d When many offered to crowdfund the gesture, Kay decided that there were \u201cmuch better uses for charitable donations\u201d and that he would fund sending a copy to the 330 Conservative MPs himself. Each copy will include a note from Kay that reads: \u201cI realise you have some big decisions to make, so I thought you could do with some light reading.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
