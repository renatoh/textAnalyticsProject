What startles me is how many courses are now available. When I was a student, in the prehistoric early Sixties, only two universities had a drama department: Bristol and Manchester. Indeed when I took an optional drama paper for an English degree at Oxford, my tutor had to scour the university to find someone willing to teach it. I also ended up sitting virtually alone in a vast exam hall one midsummer morning writing the paper. Even if Oxbridge remains sniffy about drama as an academic subject, almost no-one else does. Drama departments have multiplied. Courses have proliferated. Even more significantly, theatre is often combined with film, academic with practical work. If you want to be an actor or movie-director, it is still advisable to go to a post-graduate specialist school. However, many universities and colleges now offer a broad-based training that will equip you for a career in the media: everyone I spoke to talked about the importance of \"transferable skills\" which means you learn how to handle budgets or organise a production team. Each degree course has its own special quality, as I learned from talking to representatives of the top three in the Guardian league table. The fact that Douglas Pye is senior lecturer in the film and theatre department at Reading says it all. \"We're not,\" he explains, \"a specialist drama department. We cover film and theatre in equal measure. We have four purpose-built spaces available for theatre where students will work, for instance, on a compilation project: creating a text, staging it and learning all the different disciplines. But we also make, on location, as many as 30 or 40 films a year and we have good facilities for digital editing. It's a wide-ranging course divided between 35% practice and 65% theory.\" Pye admits that most of the students have to do paid work during term. But he still argues that the combined film and theatre course, which started in 1973, is one of the best anywhere. Jacky Bratton, head of drama and theatre at Royal Holloway College, has a slightly different emphasis. \"We have a separate media arts department specialising in film, though inevitably there is an overlap. We're unique in that we don't distinguish between practice and theory: we expect people to learn the theory by putting on a production. So you might be reading Aristotle, Marx or Baudrillard while learning how to light. What's also vital is that everyone on our staff of 18 is doing research, which means they can teach something close to their heart. At the moment we must have the only course anywhere on Chinese puppetry because one of our staff is doing a research project on that subject. But we also bring in a lot of people from outside, including directors of the calibre of Faynia Williams, and we get students to mount their own projects: one, currently, is to rewrite Antony and Cleopatra as a Greek tragedy.\" Having occasionally lectured at Royal Holloway, I can also vouch for their excellent facilities, including a replica Japanese Noh theatre built from unvarnished maple. Bristol, of course, has the advantage of a great tradition: it boasts the oldest drama department in the country founded by Glynne Wickham in 1947. But Janet Thumim, the current head of the department, stresses it has more than kept pace with the times. In the first year, everyone does film and theatre work: in the second and final years, the course is more focused on individual needs. Like everyone else, she stresses the vital importance of a \"research-active\" staff and transferable skills. But she also says the Bristol ethos is crucial. \"It's a city with a lively media culture: not only theatres like the Bristol Old Vic and the Tobacco Factory but also a host of independent film companies and galleries. We also have our own excellent Wickham Theatre which is used for performance and teaching and takes in visiting professional productions.\" But what happens to the vast army of students now equipped with drama degrees? Some go into theatre, some into film, some into independent companies as researchers and runners. The more academically inclined go into teaching. Jacky Bratton says that, at alumni days, she even comes across police officers and accountants who've studied drama; which is what must be meant by transferable skills. But if any one thing strikes me about drama studies today - both from talking to heads of departments and personal experience - it is that you don't just sit around studying Brecht and Stanislavsky. You're expected to do as well as read; and you're just as likely to end up lighting a movie as devising your own play. Eclecticism and media-savvy are the names of the game. I just wish it had been like this in my day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
