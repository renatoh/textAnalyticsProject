The City Ground board are due to meet later this evening to discuss the immediate replacement for Megson, who leaves the club 13th in League One, just four points above the relegation zone. \"Nottingham Forest can confirm that manager Gary Megson has today left the club by mutual consent,\" read a club statement. \"The board will be meeting this evening to discuss the matter of an interim managerial appointment. The club will make no further statement until chairman Nigel Doughty has spoken to the football staff and the players tomorrow.\" Forest have failed to force their way into contention for promotion back to the Championship, from where they were relegated last season, and last night's 3-0 defeat away at Oldham proved the final act of Megson's unsuccessful 13-month spell at the club. Last season they became the first former European champions to be demoted to the third tier of their national league, having dropped to that level for the first time in 54 years. Forest sit alongside Liverpool, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Milan as one of only eight teams to have won the European Cup in successive years, which they did in 1979 and 1980. Megson replaced Joe Kinnear at the City Ground in January 2005, having been out of football since the previous October after a spell in charge of West Bromwich Albion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
