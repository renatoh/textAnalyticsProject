They buy, for example, a package holiday and that is exactly what they get - a nice fat package of tickets, itineraries and brochure pictures of sunset seas. Then they start fretting about frivolous extras. Take Chris Kerr. He and his fiancee have been bugging the travel agent Going Places and Virgin Holidays for weeks because the \"newly refurbished\" Barbados hotel they booked a year ago as their wedding venue does not appear to have been built yet. The Almond Casuarina Resort was supposed to have been completed last summer, then the date was pushed back to winter. January was mentioned, then February, now Virgin is sure it will be finished by the end of May or June. The pictures posted online by a Barbados resident do not look encouraging, however. The building appears to be paddling in a tide of builders' rubble. Kerr is getting edgy because his \u00a311,000 wedding is booked for July. \"It seems that Virgin are not actually informing customers until they are in Barbados and then they are moving them to a non-comparable hotel on the other side of the island,\" he says. \"We specifically chose to be in the south because of the facilities, but Virgin says that if we want to move to another hotel in that area we will have to pay an extra \u00a32,500.\" Virgin's press office, always moved by romance, offers to move the wedding couple to the Almond Beach Resort on the west of the island. This is exactly where Kerr and his fiancee do not wish to be because, he explains, of inferior night life and poor reviews. And so, marvelling at its own munificence, Virgin decides that they can be transferred free to the swanky Turtle Beach Resort close by their original choice \"because the change has happened so close to departure and they are planning such a special trip\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
