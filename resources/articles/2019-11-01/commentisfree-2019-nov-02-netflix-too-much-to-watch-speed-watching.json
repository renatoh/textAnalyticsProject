Films? Well, it\u2019s tempting. The new Martin Scorsese movie is three and a half hours long, and some of us like to be in bed before midnight. This week we learned that Netflix has been testing a new feature that allows users to speed up their viewing without sacrificing the dialogue (making it different from the fast-forward button), prompting outpourings of fury from filmmakers on social media. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with our timing,\u201d frothed Judd Apatow, the director of Trainwreck and Knocked Up. \u201cWe give you nice things. Leave them as they were intended to be seen.\u201d \u201cAnother spectacularly bad idea, and another cut to the already bleeding-out cinema experience,\u201d raged Brad Bird, he of The Incredibles and Ratatouille. You can see why they might feel aggrieved. It\u2019s bad enough that Netflix has provided a \u201cskip intro\u201d function, because, really, who gives a toss about who did all the work? Now the expertise and graft they put into creating a visually stunning, expertly paced masterpiece can be bypassed by some idiot pressing a button and turning it into a high-definition Benny Hill Show. While you could argue that there\u2019s no compulsion to use the function, actors and directors would say that that\u2019s not the point. Novelists don\u2019t write imagining that readers will skim their latest opus; musicians don\u2019t write songs expecting them to be played back at double speed. While filmmakers don\u2019t get to decide when we press pause before we go to make a cup of tea, they should surely be able to count on the fact that their work will be viewed at the pace that was intended. Defenders of this function have cited podcasts as a medium whose programmes can be sped up for time-poor listeners without adversely affecting the experience. While there\u2019s something to be said for being able to up the pace in order to finish a show before the end of your commute or morning run, it hardly enhances the work. Studies have shown that time-compressed speech leads to a drop in comprehension for the listener, although I\u2019m more concerned about what it does to the voices. Podcast hosts sounding like characters from Disney movies don\u2019t always make for an engaging listen. Nonetheless, Netflix\u2019s new feature, currently only available to some Android users, could be seen as the logical solution to a world flooded with films and TV series that no one person could hope to watch in a lifetime. Right now, my list of unwatched but must-see films and TV series is so long that it\u2019s stressing me out; I am forever marooned in catch-up mode. Remember when we only had a handful of channels to choose from, and when watching a film at home meant seeing The Poseidon Adventure for the 67th time, or making a trip to Blockbuster? Back then, I would sit through any old crap. This is not about reduced attention spans supposedly afflicting viewers in the internet age, it\u2019s about a surfeit of stuff demanding our attention. Choice can be a good thing but, beyond a certain point, the impulse to skip forwards, or switch to something else, can be overwhelming. It stands to reason that networks will do their utmost to speed up our consumption \u2013 with greater competition between streaming services intensified by the arrival of Apple TV+ and the forthcoming platform Disney+, the fight for our eyeballs is becoming ever more brutal. More dispiriting is what this desire to speed things up says about how we, the viewers, have come to see entertainment. It used to be that it was something we did in our downtime to help lift us from the daily grind. But, increasingly, getting through the list of must-see series is a mountain to be conquered, or a job in which we are rewarded for increased productivity. Of course, there is another solution to the fact that we are drowning in what streaming companies charmingly call \u201ccontent\u201d, and that is to reduce the output, and focus on quality not quantity. It\u2019s hardly a revolutionary idea, but one that seems to elude the networks that see it as necessary to dump a lorryload of new shows on their platforms every week, much of it drivel. Directors could do their bit, too, by trimming their masterworks to a length less likely to give us all arse-ache. We live in a televisual world in which bigger is seen as better, and commissioning budgets have duly skyrocketed. Three and a half hours to watch a movie? I\u2019ve had shorter holidays than that. Perhaps it\u2019s time to scale things back \u2013 or the problem won\u2019t be speed-watching, it\u2019ll be cancelled subscriptions all round. \u2022 Fiona Sturges is an arts writer specialising in books, music, podcasting and TV"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
