This looks a long-term plan for the grey, a horse who loves a sound surface and is owned by a Scotsman, Ronnie Bartlett. Two years ago Fagan finished best of all to be second in the Albert Bartlett Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival, despite having started at 33-1. He has been lightly raced since then but his second place to Black Corton in October looks a lot better than it did at the time. With Davy Russell to nurse him through this, he can show himself to be the latest fine staying chaser based with Elliott. 1.45 Ayr Carrying the same colours as Fagan, Dandridge is based with Arthur Moore and is a talented two-mile chaser at his best, having twice made the first four in the Grand Annual. He has dropped to a good mark, has had a wind op and now gets cheekpieces. This looks winnable. 2.00 Newbury Roger Varian has been hitting the bar a lot but hopefully Defoe is ready to go, because this is a straightforward opportunity for a horse whose only defeat last year was in the Leger. 2.20 Ayr Lightly raced in recent months, Dingo Dollar gets the ground he likes and can bag his third handicap chase in a row. 2.35 Newbury Gavota might need this, so Dance Diva could be worth a shot, having shown plenty of talent in the first half of last season. 2.55 Ayr Tom Lacey\u2019s stable is on the run of a lifetime and his Flashing Glance could be the one here, having won tidily last month on his first start since wind surgery. 3.10 Newbury From a yard that has yet to have a winner in 2018, Expert Eye is opposable at these odds. James Garfield was not far behind him at Goodwood and improved to win the Mill Reef in September. This could be his big day. 3.30 Ayr Peregrine Run is not to be underestimated on this sort of ground but Mia\u2019s Storm looks the standout talent, her Boxing Day fall having been the only blip on her record this season. 3.45 Newbury A fine effort at Ascot last May suggests Graphite Storm might be quite well suited by the straight mile here. He starts the season on a fair mark and his yard has been among the winners."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
