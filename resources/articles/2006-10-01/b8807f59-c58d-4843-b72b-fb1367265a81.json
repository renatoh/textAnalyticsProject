A slow early gallop contributed to a modest final time of 2m 31.7secs - over four seconds slower than Hurricane Run last year when the ground was softish. Rail Link relaxed beautifully under Stephane Pasquier, who turned into the home straight in fifth place. Angled out for a run, the three-year-old hit the front a furlong out out and would not be denied. 2 Pride The unlucky horse of the race. Dropped out last, she had only daylight behind her on the home turn and was switched round tiring rivals before finishing best of all. 3 Deep Impact Yutaka Take was not to be caught out by the funereal pace and had the Japanese raider in the van throughout. Third into the home straight, Deep Impact battled his way into the lead two furlongs out but then came under pressure, Take not looking as strong in the finish as the riders of the first two. 4 Hurricane Run One of the worst sufferers from the lack of pace, last year's winner was close enough in fourth spot, though under pressure and struggling to quicken, when denied a clear run 1f out. Stayed on well, but would have benefited from an end-to-end gallop. 5 Best Name Another who did well to reach his finishing position after being held up. Sixth into the straight, he made his effort on the inside but did not have a lot of room two furlongs out. He ran on well and was going on again at the finish. 6 Irish Wells Known to be a front-runner from some of his earlier races, he duly took up the running but only at an ordinary gallop, his jockey perhaps anxious not to set the race up for others. It is a reflection of the overall slow pace that he did not drop away when headed two furlongs out. 7 Sixties Icon Dropping back from 1m6f, the St Leger winner, who sweated up before the start, never had the chance to show his form the way the race was run. Held up by Frankie Dettori, he turned into the straight with only Pride behind him but could never summon the pace to get involved. 8 Shirocco The disappointment of the race, having beaten Hurricane Run and Pride in a cat-and-mouse affair in the Prix Foy. Second into the straight, he had every chance but dropped right away in the final furlong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
