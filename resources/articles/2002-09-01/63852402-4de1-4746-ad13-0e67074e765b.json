Cue the Good Samaritan who whisks a cloth from nowhere and wipes off the mess, uttering various choice phrases about dirty, disgusting pigeons. Beware. While cleaning you up, they will be cleaning you out of any valuables in your pockets. Variations: Substitute spit or any other disgusting substance in the place of bird poo. Where: Anywhere from Barcelona to South America, but especially Peru and Rio. 2 The airport scanner setup How it happens You're at the airport and put your laptop on the luggage scanner conveyor belt before waiting behind two people to go through the metal detector. The first goes through without a hitch, but the second person triggers the detector and goes through the tedious process of removing his jewellery and emptying everything from coins to chewing gum from his pockets. By the time you get through the machine, the first person has disappeared, and so has your laptop. Variations: Substitute laptop for your handbag or other valuables. Where: Oporto, Portugal. 3 The street block How it happens Perhaps the most fundamental of all the scams, the block is often employed in a busy market or street. You're walking along when the woman in front of you stops to re-adjust her grip on the child she's carrying. As you are forced to stop, a granny relieves you of your valuables, either with the help of a razor blade or sticky fingers. Variations: Substitute the woman and child plus granny with any combination of two accomplices. Where: A widespread manoeuvre but especially in Quito, Ecuador. 4 The crooked currency exchange How it happens You're delighted to find that changing your money on the black market from the shady looking guy on the corner will give you a much better rate than at the bureau de change or the hotel front desk, and there's no commission either. You hand over the readies to get a huge wedge of notes, which you rush to put away: someone might nick them. Counting your money in the hotel room, you realise you've been handed a pile of worthless notes. Variations: Newspaper is used to bulk out a couple of 'good' notes on either side of the pack. Where: South America, India and anywhere there is a black market for the local currency. 5 The train compartment trick How it happens There you are, luxuriating in the fact that you've nabbed an empty compartment. While waiting for your train to draw out of the station, someone on the platform taps at the window, beckoning you. You approach, only to see them run off. When you return to your seat, you find an even emptier compartment: your bags have been nicked. Variations: Bus drivers stow your luggage away, slipping any small bags out of sight. Where: Europe, India and south-east Asia. 6 The taxi dodge How it happens You are just off the plane in a country you don't know. Everything's looking a little strange so you decide not to chance things: far safer to take a taxi to your hotel, even if has no meter. You hand the driver a $100 bill. As you wait for your change, he waves the banknote in your face, saying you've made a mistake: you've handed him a $1 note, though it's an easy error if you're not used to the currency. It all looks the same, after all. Only when you get into your hotel room do you realise he's somehow pocketed your first $100 bill and got you to give him a second one. Variations: The cab driver doubles his original fare and isn't taking no for an answer. Or his route to the hotel - 15 minutes, according to your hotel brochure - mysteriously ends up as a 45-minute journey. Where: The US, especially New York. 7 The flat tyre trick How it happens Cruising along on the motorway, a helpful soul in another car gestures to your back tyre to tell you it's gone flat. When you pull on to the hard shoulder to take a look, they draw up behind you to offer you help with the tyre, which seemed all right before you pulled into the last service station. They might rid you of the puncture, but while you are struggling with the jack, their accomplice will also relieve you of any valuables in the front of your car. Variations: Some thieves don't even bother with the tyre charade but simply wait for you to slow down at traffic lights and open your car door, seizing any bags they can grab. Where: The south of France, Spain and anywhere your car - your own or rented - marks you out as a tourist. 8 The fake policeman routine How it happens No, it's not something out of Monty Python . In fact, it all seems perfectly above board. A friendly stranger strikes up a conversation with you and while you're chatting away, a policeman approaches, saying he is on the trail of some fake banknotes and asks to see your passport and money. The other traveller hands his over and gets them back. When you hand over your cash, the policeman and the traveller disappear with it. Variations: Substitute fake policeman for fake official of any kind, at a roadblock, in a train station, or even someone charging you to take photographs at tourist sights. Where: Colombia (fake policeman) and Egypt (fake officials, particularly at the Giza pyramids). 9 The scratchcard scam How it happens Strolling along the seafront in your holiday resort you are handed a scratchcard offering you the chance to win a free holiday. To your delight you see that you've won a prize. However, in order to claim your 'free' holiday you will be asked to attend a short presentation or take part in a survey. You will be told emphatically that this is NOT a timeshare sales pitch. It's a 'holiday club' giving you lifelong access to discounted holidays. Three hours of hard sell later you hand over a hefty membership fee to join this club, only for the promised holiday deals never to materialise. When you follow it up the company will mysteriously disappear too. Variations: Sometimes you will be telephoned at home and told you've won a free holiday. Where: Spain and the Canary Islands. 10 The hotel 'pickup' ploy How it happens Local hoteliers get hold of a tourist guidebook that recommends certain hotels to travellers. When you arrive at your destination someone who claims to be from the recommended hotel meets you and offers to drive you there but ends up taking you to a completely different, and no doubt inferior, property. Where: Varanasi, India but can happen anywhere where you can't read or speak the local lingo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
