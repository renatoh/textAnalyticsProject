Between November and December last year, 414 men and nine women were found guilty during 13 trials held in selected courts in 13 districts around the country, according to the justice, law and order sector, a body that brings together government ministries working on legal matters. The perpetrators were handed sentences ranging from community service to up to 50 years in jail. \u201cOverall, the objective of the pilot was met with unprecedented success, leading to the disposal of over 788 cases against the target of 650 cases,\u201d said a report. Activists and campaigners have welcomed the convictions, which they described as \u201cdecisive action\u201d that sends a strong message. \u201cWe applaud the gesture of special court sessions on GBV [gender-based violence]. Convicting more than 400 perpetrators is an exciting and welcomed landmark,\u201d said Simon Richard Mugenyi, advocacy and communications manager at Reproductive Health Uganda. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive signal to those who plan to abuse women\u2019s rights. It has been one of the missing links. Therefore, this will go a long away to curb GBV.\u201d Florence Auma, programme specialist for gender and human rights at the UN population fund in Uganda, said: \u201cThe convictions were deterrent enough for those that went through the court process. For those that plea-bargained, the highest penalty was 28 years in prison, including time already served on remand.\u201d The mother of a 12-year-old girl abused by her 35-year-old uncle in the eastern district of Soroti welcomed the decision to sentence the man to 19 years in jail. \u201cI am happy with the sentence and I know it is a lesson for other men in the community,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody said the perpetrator would bribe the officials and be set free. When I heard the sentence, I felt that justice had been served.\u201d The Ugandan police crime report recorded 14,985 cases of defilement (sexual assault on a person under 18) and 1,335 rape cases in 2017. \u201cSGBV [sexual and gender-based violence] has been on the increase in Uganda. Decisive action is therefore required,\u201d said Livingstone Sewanyana, executive director at the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative. \u201cGiven that [sexual violence] involves infringement of the dignity and privacy of the individual, having special courts on SGBV is appropriate. Giving deterrent sentences is encouraged,\u201d he said. The special sessions were successfully piloted between 12 November and 15 December to help clear a backlog of more than 1,000 cases. Mercy Grace Munduru, a lawyer and human rights activist, said the convictions could not obscure the need for the judiciary to learn more about trying sexual violence cases. \u201cThere is need for specialised training for judicial officers who directly adjudicate over these matters; there is also need to comprehensively engage communities in this process prior to establishing special courts,\u201d she said. \u201cThe specialised nature of the courts requires a careful approach.\u201d The report said prosecutions for gender-based violence needed to be handled with greater sensitivity towards survivors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
