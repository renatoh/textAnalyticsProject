According to research by Norwich Union, thieves prey on UK homes during the holiday season. The company estimates that about 4.2 million people have been the victims of garden crooks. It states that the most common items stolen are bicycles and laundry that has been hung out and left to dry. But the Norwich Union study also says a growing number of thieves are also digging up plants and walking off with ornaments, pots and statues. The Association of British Insurers estimates that one in seven households will experience a theft in their garden before the year is out. With Britons becoming increasingly passionate about gardening, thanks largely to TV programmes such as Ground Force and Home Front, they are spending far more on plants and outdoor items such as barbecues. Norwich Union says more than half the garden thefts occur at night; but two in five happen in the cold light of day. Nick Pierson, head of household product development at Norwich Union, says: \"Homeowners are constantly being reminded to keep their actual houses secure from burglars, but the rest of their property is often forgotten. With more people spending money on their gardens, a few simple deterrents such as a strong padlock on the garden gate, a security light and a decent shed lock will put off all but the most determined of thieves.\" Research from Royal &amp; SunAlliance, another household insurer, found that, in the past year, eight out of ten people spent up to \u00a3300 on their gardens. Yet 80% did not know the value of their plants, trees and garden furniture and only 36% were sure that their gardens were covered by a household policy. This was despite the fact that one in three had experienced theft from their gardens over the past year, compared with one in five the year before. Anyone who has invested in their garden should make sure what is and isn't covered. In many cases they may find the insurance they have is inadequate. In some cases it is possible to add on extra cover for an additional premium. Norwich Union's Home and Garden package can be added to a Home Plus policy. It provides up to \u00a32,500 worth of cover for re-landscaping your garden if it's vandalised and will replace plants if they are stolen. Without an add-on, most insurers will only cover up to about \u00a3300 for gardens, unless items are locked up at night. But NIG and Marks &amp; Spencer are exceptions and both offer unlimited cover. Also, most ordinary policies do not include plants, though exceptions to this rule are Eagle Star, Royal &amp; SunAlliance and NIG. Eagle Star, for example, pays up to \u00a3750 for loss or damage to plants, lawns, bushes, shrubs, trees and flowerbeds. Since many older people also enjoy gardening, the Retirement Insurance Advisory Service, has produced a special policy called Garden Secure, which is available to those who already have buildings and contents cover with the company. For an outlay of \u00a31.75 a month, gardeners can obtain cover for up to \u00a3750 a year. This includes home boundaries such as fences, walls and gates as well as garden shrubs, plants, trees, lawns and ponds. Theft and malicious damage is also incorporated, along with damage by wild animals. TOP TIPS ON PREVENTING GARDEN THEFT \u0095 Have strong padlocks put on sheds. \u0095 Consider security lighting or an infra red beam, available from specialist security retailers. \u0095 Put a layer of heavy rocks in pots containing plants below the soil. This makes them difficult to move. \u0095 If you have a driveway, consider using gravel. This is noisy and slows down thieves using wheelbarrows. \u0095 Prickly hedges are an excellent deterrent. But, it is illegal to put broken glass set in concrete on top of a wall or use barbed wire. \u0095 Use a security marking kit to identify items in the shed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
