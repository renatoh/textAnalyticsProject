The wide-ranging survey, for the electoral commission in combination with the Hansard Society, also discovered that although nearly three quarters of people believed it was their \"duty\" to vote, only 51% said they were certain to do so. Perhaps most worryingly of all, a majority of people feel the current system of governing Britain needs improving \"quite a lot\" or \"a great deal\". And barely a quarter of those questioned realised that the statement: \"There has to be a general election every four years\" is untrue. Among the encouraging signs in the survey of just over 1,000 adults was that one in six consumers have boycotted a product for ethical, political or environmental reasons. But the study - entitled the national audit of political engagement - found that just 27% of people \"have trust in politicians\". However, people view individual MPs more favourably than MPs as a collective, with 41% of people satisfied with their own MP and just 13% dissatisfied. And people who have recently had contact with their local MP are much more likely to be satisfied with their performance than those that have not (62% as against 38%). But it found that less than half the public are \"well informed\" about politics, both in terms of their perceived and assessed knowledge. Correspondingly, the public - and MPs - believe that the media, business and local councils have more impact on people's everyday lives than the Westminster parliament or the European parliament Only 5% had attended a political meeting or donated money to a political party and just 1% had taken an active role in a party's general or local election campaign. The electoral commission chairman, Sam Younger, said: \"The audit clearly demonstrates that people want to have a say in the way decisions are made and to feel reassured that they are being listened to. \"As elected representatives, politicians at all levels must make that connection and we hope this audit will be the catalyst for debate and action.\" The Hansard Society chairman, Lord Holme, said: \"The essence of democracy is a continuous dialogue between governors and governed, but as this audit shows, that dialogue has broken down. People still care but don't connect. \"If we are to reinvigorate the health of our democracy, it is vital that politicians and political institutions take note of these findings and investigate new ways of engaging and consulting the public.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
