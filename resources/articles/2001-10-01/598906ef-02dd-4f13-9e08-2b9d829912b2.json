More than 1,500 people attended the funeral in O'Hagan's home town of Lurgan, County Armagh. Speaking at the graveside, Father Brian D'Arcy declared: \"Martin was gunned down because he got nearer the truth than the rest of us.\" Father D'Arcy, a columnist on the Dublin-based Sunday World for which O'Hagan worked, said: \"He was sadly and violently taken from us.\" He described the reporter as a tenacious seeker of the truth and said it was up to other journalists to carry on his work. The 51-year-old reporter was shot dead in front of his wife on Friday night as they walked home from their local pub. O'Hagan had been the subject of numerous loyalist death threats and was forced to flee Northern Ireland in the 90s after the former Loyalist Volunteer Force leader, Billy \"Kingrat\" Wright, threatened to kill him. Wright was shot dead by republicans inside the top security Maze prison in 1998. O'Hagan's murder was claimed by the Red Hand Defenders, a cover name used by both the LDF and the Ulster Defence Association. The security forces believe the LDF was the most likely suspect. O'Hagan's widow, Marie, and his daughters, Martina, Cara and Niamh, led the mourners from a private service in the family home to the burial. His journalist colleagues took it in turns to carry the coffin along the mile-long route. Among them was Jim Campbell, a fellow journalist on the Sunday World, who still carries a bullet from a loyalist murder bid. He was shot at his Belfast home in the early 80s. The junior Northern Ireland office minister, Des Browne, represented the government at the funeral, which was also attended by Brid Rodgers, the local SDLP assembly member and the agriculture minister in the Northern Ireland power sharing executive. All editorial staff from the Sunday World offices in Dublin and Belfast, where O'Hagan was based, travelled to the funeral. Downing Street today strongly condemned the \"barbarism\" of the killing. The prime minister's official spokesman said it had still not been established which paramilitary group was responsible for the murder but pledged all paramilitary ceasefires would be kept under review. \"The government would not hesitate to specify any group,\" the spokesman said. The Ulster secretary, Dr John Reid, was tonight due to take part in an SDLP fringe meeting at the Labour party conference in Brighton and was expected to face questions about the loyalist ceasefires. The European Commission today condemned the murder and the International Press Institute in Vienna denounced the killers and urged Dr Reid to bring to justice those responsible. The secretary of state was urged to do everything in his power to \"ensure the safety\" of journalists covering events in Northern Ireland. In a tribute to the murdered journalist, Northern Ireland Assembly members at Stormont held a minute's silence. O'Hagan was the first journalist to be murdered in Ulster during more than 30 years of violence. He was known for his pursuit of paramilitaries and drug dealers - a dedication that prompted numerous threats and led to his death. Police investigating the murder are expected to visit his office this week in the hope of pinpointing his killers by studying his computer records. The RUC chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanaghan, confirmed today police were pursuing a line of inquiry that \"local elements of the LDF\" were involved in the murder. He said: \"It would be wrong at this stage of the investigation to say it has been firmly established who is responsible for this horrific killing.\" Sir Ronnie added: \"Certainly there has been much speculation about this murder and we would have to acknowledge there have been links between the LDF and the UDA through certain individuals. \"However, at this stage, there is nothing to suggest definitely who was responsible.\" On Friday, Dr Reid made an 11th hour decision not to declare the UDA ceasefire over. He had received a UDA commitment stating the violence that plagued North Belfast through the summer would be brought to an end. He warned the organisations he would watch them and would not hesitate to act if there was more violence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
