The Australian prime minister stressed the move to grant a five-year extension to about 10,000 temporary visa holders already in Australia, and then a pathway to permanent residency, was merely an \u201cadjustment\u201d of existing policy settings. He told reporters gathered in the prime minister\u2019s courtyard of Parliament House on Thursday he was also \u201cnot expecting large numbers\u201d of people now in Hong Kong to apply to come to Australia, and in any case, they would be subject to \u201cthe normal application mechanisms\u201d. This was not \u2013 he insisted \u2013 anything like Boris Johnson\u2019s offer to as many as 3 million residents of the former British colony, those with British national overseas status, the right to settle in the UK. No, Australia was not talking about such large numbers, and the UK\u2019s history meant it had a \u201cvery special set of responsibilities\u201d to deal with any exodus from Hong Kong. Dr Lee Morgenbesser, a senior lecturer at the Griffith Asia institute at Griffith University, says Australia\u2019s tweak to its visa rules \u201cwould not be sufficient\u201d without being accompanied by the UK\u2019s offer. He says Morrison chose his words carefully. It certainly was not framed as \u201cTiananmen Square 2.0\u201d \u2013 a reference to when as prime minister Bob Hawke offered asylum to about 42,000 Chinese students after the 1989 massacre. Ben Bland, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute and the author of Generation HK: Seeking Identity in China\u2019s Shadow, believes Australia\u2019s move will provide much-needed relief and options for the Hongkongers working and studying in Australia who are concerned about their future back home. \u201cBut Canberra is letting the UK, which bears a direct responsibility as Hong Kong\u2019s former colonial master, do the bulk of the heavy lifting in terms of those who are in Hong Kong and want to leave.\u201d Perhaps the most forward-leaning portion of the government\u2019s press conference was the suggestion from the acting immigration minister, Alan Tudge, that Australia wanted to persuade highly talented business owners and entrepreneurs to relocate from Hong Kong because \u201cwe know that many individuals now might be looking elsewhere, because they do want to be in a freer country, they want to be in a democratic country\u201d. There are several unanswered questions, including whether the government will make arrangements for family reunions for the tens of thousands of Hong Kong-born people who are permanent residents or citizens of Australia. But it was notable that the offer was couched as an attempt to recruit skilled migrants rather than a humanitarian gesture: Australia\u2019s refugee program would continue as normal without a special intake being created. It\u2019s no surprise that Morrison sought to minimise the scale of the changes, given that the relationship between Australia and China has become increasingly heated \u2013 and difficult to navigate. While Australia was quick out of the blocks in calling for an independent coronavirus inquiry \u2013 and copped a furious reaction from its largest trading partner as a result \u2013 this time Morrison has pointed out Australia is merely one of many countries raising concerns about the impact of the national security law on Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms; so worried, in fact, that Australia would also suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong. Australia was simply \u201cadjusting its laws, our sovereign laws, our sovereign immigration program, things that we have responsibility for and jurisdiction over, to reflect the changes that we\u2019re seeing take place there\u201d. Nothing to see here. In the end, the government\u2019s formulation wasn\u2019t enough to hold off a swift rebuke from China, which is especially sensitive when Hong Kong and Taiwan are mentioned because it believes they relate to \u201ccore interests\u201d of national unity and sovereignty. The Chinese embassy in Canberra said Beijing \u201cstrongly deplores and opposes the groundless accusations\u201d and called on Australia \u201cto immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China\u2019s internal affairs under any pretext or in any way, otherwise it will lead to nothing but lifting a rock only to hit its own feet\u201d. The Australian government has been receiving advice to be patient and hold the line amid the turbulence in its relationship with China. The Guardian understands that one emerging view is that Australia eventually needs to find a new landing point in the relationship; that there can be no return to the status quo and that it is becoming harder to paper over the differences. It is well known that Australian ministers have lately struggled to arrange calls with their Chinese counterparts to talk through issues including the barley tariffs \u2013 but some within the government have cautioned that this may be a pressure tactic from Beijing. After all, Chinese officials have long had objections to Australia\u2019s arrangements to prevent other countries \u201cdumping\u201d products at low cost on Australia, and China may have chosen the timing and framing of the barley tariffs for political effect. Differences about Hong Kong make it increasingly difficult to see what a breakthrough in the Australia-China relationship might look like but each side is likely to be warier of the other when high-level talks resume. In the meantime, Australia is moving to shore up ties with its other important regional partners, including Japan. To that end, Morrison held a virtual meeting late on Thursday with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in which they shared \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the Hong Kong national security law as they both believed it \u201ceroded Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy under the \u2018One Country Two Systems\u2019 framework\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
