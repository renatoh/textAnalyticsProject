The late change of heart on Found\u2019s target here was confirmed only on Monday morning, when she was declared for the Turf rather than the Classic, which had been listed as her \u201cfirst preference\u201d engagement. The switch means that O\u2019Brien will be double-handed in the Turf, in which his colt Highland Reel, the King George winner, is also a leading contender, but the trainer said that John Magnier, the prime mover in the Coolmore Stud syndicate which owns Found, had been \u201cmore comfortable\u201d sending the Arc winner back to the Turf, a contest which she won at Keeneland 12 months ago. \u201cThe lads were more comfortable doing that,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThere were an awful lot of unknowns on the dirt. What was pushing us to the dirt was that she\u2019s tactically fast, she stays very well and she\u2019s a quick breaker, that\u2019s what was leaning us that way, and we had Highland Reel for the Turf. He missed [Champions Day at] Ascot and came straight here and we always thought that a mile and a half on fast ground around here was going to suit him, that was the thinking. \u201cIf anything happened to Found \u2026 you\u2019re pitching her in, it would have been unfair to her, she would never have experienced anything like that, and she\u2019ll be in her own comfort zone on the turf. \u201cJM didn\u2019t want to risk her, he knew that she\u2019s irreplaceable. She\u2019s probably the most genuine mare I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, if you saw her in the Arc, she put every sinew of her body into going forward when she was asked to. If you watch it in slow motion, it\u2019s the most incredible thing you ever saw, she gives it all and gives it freely.\u201d The turf track at Santa Anita was relaid in the summer and is expected to ride even faster than usual this weekend, which will be a sharp contrast to the easier ground on which Found beat Golden Horn, the Derby winner, in last year\u2019s Turf. \u201cShe\u2019s run on fast ground a lot,\u201d O\u2019Brien said \u201cI think when she was just beaten in the Coronation [Stakes at Royal Ascot] last year, that was fast ground. They say it\u2019s very quick here, but she has very good form on it, and it wasn\u2019t really soft at Chantilly [for the Arc]. You don\u2019t come here and expect it to be anything else. \u201cShe\u2019s a hardy lady and she\u2019s in good form since Ascot [where Found was second to Almanzor in the Champion Stakes]. Having the two of them in the race gives us a better chance, but obviously it\u2019s a very good race.\u201d O\u2019Brien has saddled 21 Group One winners this season and has runners in six of the 13 Breeders\u2019 Cup races this weekend, when four wins would see him equal Bobby Frankel\u2019s all-time record of 25 top-flight victories in a calendar year. Monday\u2019s draw for post positions dealt his team a few tricky stalls, however, prompting Ryan Moore, his principal jockey, to text the trainer before leaving Australia after riding in Tuesday\u2019s Melbourne Cup. \u201cHe was just getting on the plane, and \u2018there\u2019s a lot to think about\u2019 was what he said,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cDraws are what they are, but we have to go through them and see what the story is. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to running Washington DC [in Saturday\u2019s Turf Sprint], there\u2019s no pressure with him and he\u2019s very fast and getting better. He\u2019ll be coming from the back, but he\u2019s hard and progressing. It\u2019s six furlongs but he has to have five-furlong pace to survive round there, and he should get it. \u201cWe\u2019ve always felt that Highland Reel would be suited by the turf here, and also Alice [Springs] in the Mile. Seventh Heaven [in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf] will be suited by the track and the ground, and we\u2019re interested to see what Roly Poly and Hydrangea do on the fast ground [in the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf].\u201d Other leading contenders for the weekend\u2019s 13 Grade One events to exercise on Tuesday morning included Tepin, the Queen Anne Stakes winner at Royal Ascot in June, and Henry Candy\u2019s Limato, her main market rival in betting for the Mile. \u201cShe\u2019s great and she\u2019s happy,\u201d said Mark Casse, Tepin\u2019s trainer. \u201cShe likes going to different places, she travels much better than the rest of us. \u201cShe\u2019s got a great post in eight, and it looks like there\u2019s a fair amount of speed in there, which is good for us. Tepin is very versatile, and once we won at Royal Ascot, this was our main objective.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
