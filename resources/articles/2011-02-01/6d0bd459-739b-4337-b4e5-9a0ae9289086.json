That might seem an odd question, since we're living through something of a golden age in this country. In London, the London Symphony are at the top of their game, the Philharmonia and the London Philharmonic are thriving; while the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the Hall\u00e9 in Manchester sound as good as anyone on their day. But there's something missing in our orchestral culture, at least according to many musicians based in Europe: a vital spark of intensity and engagement. British orchestras have an unimpeach-able reputation for speed and accuracy. Talking to Simon Rattle ahead of his London residency with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, he told me that one of the principal players in Berlin had a stint as a section leader at one of London's orchestras. He was amazed at the brilliance of the British musicians in the first rehearsal of a complex piece by Bart\u00f3k. The technical standard was much better than it would have been at the Berlin Phil at a first rehearsal. The problem was, the final concert wasn't any more exciting than that first run-through. That's the exact opposite of what happens in Berlin, or Vienna with their Philharmonic, or Amsterdam with the Concertgebouw. With those great European orchestras, there's a journey. You would be shocked if you heard these bands when they rehearse a piece for the first time: they are much less together than their British counterparts. The payoff is, though, that the concerts of the Vienna Phil or the Concertgebouw often have an expressive intensity that British orchestras rarely manage. It's a different way of thinking about what performance is. The goal in Berlin or Munich is to get to a place where the music is in the bones of the players; in Britain, the problem is getting further into the music than playing all of the notes in the right order. As the Association of British Orchestras convenes for their annual conference this week, the challenge for our orchestras is to turn that unrivalled reputation for technique and speed into the x-factor of the thrill of performance. Get that right, and there's no reason why our concerts shouldn't be as seat-of-the-pants exciting as the Berlin Philharmonic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
