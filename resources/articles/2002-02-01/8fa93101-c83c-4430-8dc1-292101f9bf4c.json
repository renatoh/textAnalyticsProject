Forest rejected a \u00a34m bid from Newcastle for Jenas, 18, a fortnight ago. But Monday's revelation that Dyer has a stress fracture in his left foot, an injury that could mean an absence of six weeks, has forced Newcastle to renew their interest. There are still details to be finalised but Newcastle are confident that Jenas will sign early next week. Forest's dire financial plight means they are vulnerable to any persistent suitor - they yesterday agreed to sell their top scorer Stern John, whose contract would have expired this summer, to Birmingham City for a nominal fee. Bobby Robson, meanwhile, has urged Sven-Goran Eriksson not to rule Dyer out of England's World Cup plans despite his injury, which could keep him out of all but England's final friendly, against Paraguay on April 17. \"As long as he doesn't break down again he'll be as fresh as a daisy,\" he said. \"He'll be the freshest man at the World Cup. I would hang in there for him if I was Sven. He's a great player and I would have him in my England team, but I don't pick it any more.\" Jenas would not be a straight replacement for Dyer but is likely to take the central position held for 10 years by Robert Lee. The injury to Michael Carrick at Southampton on Wednesday night, meanwhile, means that West Ham's desire to recruit Lee is stronger than ever, though they may need to sell Paolo di Canio to raise funds for the move. Di Canio has claimed that he is being forced out of the club, despite the fact that his protracted dealings with Manchester United appear to have permanently derailed. His manager Glenn Roeder describes the move to Old Trafford as \"definitely in the history books\" but the Italian insists he is being pushed towards the exit door at Upton Park. \"The manager does not want me to go but I don't know if I'll be here at the end of the season,\" he said yesterday. \"I'll stay because I have a contract but . . . the club want to sell me.\" If Di Canio is right he may play his last match for the club against Blackburn tomorrow, after which he starts a three-match suspension."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
