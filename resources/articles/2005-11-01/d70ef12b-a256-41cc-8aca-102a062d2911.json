The deal raised questions about the future of Gale's Horndean brewery near Portsmouth, famed for HSB ale. The Campaign for Real Ale vowed to fight closures. Fuller's insisted its integration would be driven by quality, not accounting. Fuller's won the backing of more than 80% of Gale's voting shares, including those of the Bowyer family, which bought the brewery from the Gale family in 1896, with a \u00a344.21 offer for each ordinary share."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
