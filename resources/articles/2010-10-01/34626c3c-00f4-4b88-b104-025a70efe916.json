Is it really almost a year since Zenyatta won the Breeders' Cup Classic? Apparently so. That sense that everything is happening ever more swiftly is a normal part of the ageing process. It is a little disturbing, though, when the same stories seem to be recurring more frequently too. Take the idea of an owners' boycott to protest about low prize money levels. Didn't we do that two or three years ago? Surely it's not time for it to come around again? When it comes to some owners, though \u2013 generally the ones who want to retain their seats on the Racehorse Owners Association council \u2013 there's never a bad time to protest. Racing is their hobby, what they choose to do with the money that they earn, or inherit, elsewhere, but they still want to strike for more. Next we will have yacht owners going on strike for bigger boats. The notion of militant millionaires will always be faintly comic, but the point to note about a proposal to organise a boycott of a race or meeting where prize money is deemed insufficient is that it needs to be organised at all. Unless the ROA tells its members not to enter - and probably even if it does \u2013 the races in question will still get the horses they need. This exposes the ROA for what it is, or at any rate, what it should be: a group that speaks on behalf of owners, rather than one that expects to be some kind of power-broker. The only measure of owners' happiness that matters, particularly as the sport looks to a more commercial future, is whether or not they are willing to run their horses for the prize money on offer. And, for all the complaints from Paul Dixon, the ROA chairman, and his acolytes, the evidence suggests that they are. This is not to suggest that racecourses should only offer what they can get away with. In a modern, commercial environment, tracks would compete for horses, which is an incentive to increase the purses, not to cut them. If bookmakers are licensed to bet on racing at a given track or group of tracks, regardless of whether the bets are placed overseas, the shortcomings of the levy system would largely be overcome, and revenue would flow more efficiently from punters to tracks, another recipe for bigger pots. Over time, the supply of horses should also change to reflect the demands of racing, rather than those of owners and breeders specifically. The ideal must be to have the right number of horses running for the right amount of money, and a free market has more chance of achieving that than the levy system \u2013 or owners' boycotts \u2013 ever will. Another story that comes around more often than it should is the suggestion that there is some flaw in the system of riding penalties for jockeys. Richard Hughes's six-day ban, received for an offence in a Class 5 race at Wolverhampton, was the catalyst this time, as it seems to have killed off the title race just as it was building towards an outstanding conclusion. It was certainly a frustrating incident, as the drive and dedication of both Hughes and Paul Hanagan has been a superb advertisement for racing this year, and both deserve to be there at the finish. Yet a suggestion that Hughes's ban should be deferred until after the turf season would not only set a dreadful precedent, it would also be deeply unfair on Hanagan, who is now champion-elect thanks at least in part to a conscious decision to avoid silly bans. The idea that he should, in effect, be penalised for sticking to the rules is bizarre."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
