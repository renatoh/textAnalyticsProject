This was certainly the case when the 31-year-old scored the decisive goal in their 2-1 win over Wycombe Wanderers . And he got it with a cheeky backheel - not bad for a striker noted more as an orchestrator than a finisher. QPR also won, 3-0 against Grimsby ; but none of the other teams in the top six did. Bournemouth 's 2-1 defeat at Hartlepool caused the latter to replace them in the play-off area, which must have delighted Sir Alex Ferguson. Last week Fergie, who worked with Hartlepool manager Neale Cooper at Aberdeen, sent him and his team a public good-luck mes sage. He said: 'It would be amazing if Hartlepool made it into the First Division - I think they would all faint up there.' One suspects many of their fans might have been on the brink of that during the Bournemouth match. James Hayter gave Bournemouth the lead, but Hartlepool hit back with two goals from Adam Boyd.
