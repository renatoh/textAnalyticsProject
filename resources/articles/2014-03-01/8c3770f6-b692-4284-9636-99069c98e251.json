But in a country that cannot, allegedly, afford decent elderly care, realistic university finance, or access to justice, it is extraordinary that the only pre-budget debate is about how to reduce the fairest source of state revenues. The Tory backbench is obsessed with raising the start-point for 40% tax, which exclusively benefits the minority who earn enough to pay it. The Lib Dem counter-proposal is for a costly fresh hike in allowances. Spreading jam thinly among almost everyone in work, this was always a woeful way to compensate low-earners for cuts to housing, childcare and tax credits. Now \u2013 as the threshold rolls past the \u00a310,000 target \u2013 an army of workers who can't get the hours to earn that amount will see no gain at all. Besides, after the sharp VAT rise, any such cut is a giveaway that disappears the moment you try to spend it. Leave income tax alone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
