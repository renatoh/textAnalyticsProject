A little while ago filming a trailer for a book was a daring novelty now it's becoming the norm. A presence on the internet is vital, particularly if you're trying getting kids' attention. We made trailers for the first three books in my Enemy series (in a nutshell, kids v zombies in a post apocalypse London) that were short and cheap and fairly simple, but for the new book \u2013 The Sacrifice - Puffin wanted to push the boat out and make something more substantial. So we came up with the stupid idea of making a cinema style trailer as if for a full length feature film. Stupid because cinema trailers usually have at least 90 minutes of glossy finished film from which to cherry pick the best moments. We were going to have to make everything up from scratch. It reminded me a bit of Roger Corman, the great exploitation producer, who would sometimes make trailers for non existent films and if they got enough interest he'd film the actual movies. Fortunately, my American publishers (Hyperion) were up for it and matched the money that Puffin were putting in, but we were still operating on a children's publishing budget rather than Hollywood. Our entire outlay probably wouldn't even pay for the sandwiches for one day on the Dark Knight Returns. We couldn't hire professional actors (apart from one boy), so we made up our cast from keen school kids and a bunch of adult zombies I recruited on Twitter and through various websites. Luckily there's a craze at the moment for dressing up as zombies \u2013 there are zombie walks, zombie festivals, zombie parties, zombie weddings, I'm sure there must even have been some zombie funerals - so it wasn't hard to find a keen bunch of amateur walking dead. The problem I was faced with was whether any of them were going to be able to act. I arrived on set with some trepidation, but soon realised my fears were unfounded. Set a bunch of 30 blood-splattered adults on some kids and they don't have to act, they are genuinely terrified. I also tried doing a bit of 28 Days Later style guerrilla filming on the early morning streets of London, and all I can say is hats off to Danny Boyle. How he managed to find any empty London streets at sunrise I have no idea. We tipped up at 5am to find the streets around St Paul's crawling with taxis, buses, cars and hordes of revellers returning home drunk. I did get one good shot, though, of some kids crossing the wobbly bridge, that gives something of the flavour of a deserted London. If only I'd waited until the Olympics were on then I could have shot everything at midday in Piccadilly Circus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
