Speaking on ABC radio in Alice Springs on Wednesday, Wyatt said he thought the current system, under which dealers voluntarily join the Indigenous Art Code (IAC), was not working. \u201cThe Indigenous art code was put into place [in 2009],\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cWe made assumptions that would work but it hasn\u2019t, and we\u2019re seeing this carpetbagging.\u201d Wyatt was responding to allegations raised this week that a private dealer in Alice Springs had taken at least three elderly Indigenous artists from their communities, and at least one was being forced to pay off tens of thousands of dollars loaned to her son by making new artworks. The ongoing practice, which appears to be re-intensifying as the Indigenous art market grows, has been described as \u201cmodern day slavery\u201d. Under the IAC, sanctions can be imposed on dealer members who have acted unethically but it has no power to regulate private dealers who are not members. \u201cI\u2019d like to see stronger sanctions,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cAnd I am talking with my colleagues about how to do this. \u201cIn my own state, I\u2019ve had experiences where people were \u2026 misled. The state government and commonwealth intervened then; we\u2019re going to do that with this one.\u201d Wyatt said he did not think it was the case that Aboriginal artists were choosing to seek better economic opportunities in working for private dealers. \u201cCarpetbagging is to the advantage of the art dealer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve often seen artists who\u2019ve sold at a much lesser price, and then [their work] has incredible mark-ups overseas.\u201d In its letter to the minister, the APY artists\u2019 collective called for the \u201cunderstaffed and under-resourced\u201d IAC to be housed within the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and given more support to regulate the industry, demand dealer transparency and end \u201ccarpetbagger sweatshops\u201d. Vivien Anderson, a Melbourne-based gallerist and director of the IAC, said when the code was established they sought to engage bodies like the ACCC to support its action. \u201cBut it became clear that we were not going to be funded to perform the task,\u201d Anderson told Guardian Australia. Anderson said police should be brought in for such exploitation cases but this was not an isolated incident \u201cand it\u2019s been going on for a while\u201d. \u201cPublic awareness is growing and I think all credit to the IAC,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it still shocks me that these individuals are able to move with such stealth, and their objective is to make money. There\u2019s not much else in it, really. It\u2019s highly opportunistic behaviour.\u201d She said the IAC successfully used its limited funds to focus on public awareness and education of consumers and artists, but it needed much more to have \u201cthe kind of weaponry, if you like, to be proactive in this [exploitation] space\u201d. In the meantime the IAC had tightened the application process, including \u201cstringent\u201d transparency requirements, for private dealers who want to be members of the code. \u201cYou also have to look at who is a fit and proper person to be working in the industry and under the circumstances this is an alarming situation. I can imagine the family is devastated.\u201d The federal minister for communications, Paul Fletcher, said the incident was a serious matter, and he welcomed the South Australian premier\u2019s referral to police and the attorney general. \u201cMy office met with minister Wyatt\u2019s office yesterday to discuss appropriate action and government is waiting on urgent advice.\u201d Fletcher said he was aware that carpetbagging had been a \u201crecurring issue\u201d and was a problem for Indigenous artists, particularly when the market was strong. He said the code was set up to address such issues and he had met with IAC a number of times to discuss further action. APY artists have been instrumental in fund-raising for the Purple House, an Aboriginal community-controlled health service which provides dialysis in remote communities. The Purple House began in 2000 with an auction of paintings at the Art Gallery of NSW, which raised $1m in one night to set up the first clinic in Alice Springs. Community controlled art centres are a very important part of the Purple House story, said CEO Sarah Brown. \u201cIt is absolutely vital that senior people are able to stay on country, to paint and pass on culture. We absolutely support the community-controlled arts sector and strongly encourage anyone who is buying art to ask serious questions about sourcing. If it feels dodgy, don\u2019t buy it.\u201d The Art Gallery of South Australia, which hosts significant Indigenous art exhibitions and events, joined calls for action. AGSA director Rhana Devenport said more than 3,800 artists had exhibited at the gallery and affiliated events, and almost 1,000 had been supported to come to Adelaide for openings, workshops and collaborations. \u201cDuring this time, AGSA has worked closely with the APY Art Collective, art centres, artists and their galleries and we support the call to address any unethical practices in the industry.\u201d A spokeswoman for the South Australian government did not provide details of the intervention flagged by Wyatt, but reiterated SA police were aware of the allegations. \u201cWe will continue to work with the federal government on implementing strategies to prevent Aboriginal artists being exploited,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
