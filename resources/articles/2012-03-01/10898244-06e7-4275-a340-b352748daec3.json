", "bodyText": "With just days to go until the end of the current tax year, banks and building societies are continuing to increase their Isa rates in the quest for savers' cash. Savers have until midnight on 5 April at the latest to get their Isa applications in. Last week, Cheshire building society, part of the Nationwide, launched its Direct Cash Isa paying 3.5%. This matches the top-paying postal Isa from the AA. Anyone with more than \u00a31,000 can invest with the Cheshire, but it doesnot allow transfers. The rate includes a 2.5% introductory offer ending on 30 September next year, so savers will need to look for a better rate before then. The best instant-access Isa for those wanting to transfer money from an existing provider is with Santander at 3.3%. You need to invest at least \u00a32,500 and the rate includes a 2.8% bonus for a year. \"Savers who opt for a standard cash Isa need to remember that the headline introductory rate is likely to mask a much poorer underlying rate,\" says Miles Bingham, CEO of money management website Governor Money . \"Once the introductory bonus expires, the average was just 1.22% on the products we examined.\" Cheshire is best for those who want to be able to access their saving at any time, but there is more on offer elsewhere. \"Fixed-rate cash Isas currently have the highest rates,\" says David Black at financial information provider Defaqto. \"But only invest funds in a fixed rate if you know that you won't need them for the duration of the fixed-rate term. \"Early withdrawals or transfers are likely to be either subject to an interest penalty or not permitted at all.\" Saga has a one-year fix at 3.6% for savers over 50, but the Halifax has the best-buy long-term fixed rates, offering 4.25%, 4.35% and 4.5% respectively on three- four- and five-year fixed Isas. Closing these accounts early will cost you dear, however, with a loss of between 270 and 365 days of interest depending on the account. What you can invest The maximum you can invest in a cash Isa this tax year is \u00a35,340. This comes out of your total allowance of \u00a310,680 before 5 April, which means you could invest the balance \u2013 \u00a35,340 \u2013 in a stocks and shares or equity Isa. Alternatively, you can use the full allowance to invest in stocks and shares, an option that has been increasingly used by savers over the past few years, despite instability in investment markets. \"One of the reasons why equity Isa sales have continued to do well is that cash returns are still so poor,\" says Ben Yearsley, investment manager at advisers Hargreaves Lansdown. \"Income-generating funds continue to be the most popular, be that equity or bonds.\" He adds: \"Corporation tax cuts in the budget should also be good news for dividends. In three years, corporation tax will be 22% compared to 28% in 2010. This 6% differential should feed through to dividends.\" Where to invest Fund management company Fidelity also believes that investing in companies that pay dividends continues to be the way forward for many investors. \"Investing in dividend-paying stocks provides defensive qualities to a portfolio, while the yields currently on offer are high by historical standards and compared to other assets,\" says Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Worldwide Investments. \"Total returns can be hugely enhanced if dividends are re-invested.\" Yearsley suggests those looking for income opt for investment stalwart Neil Woodford's Invesco Perpetual Income fund. More cautious investors should consider Jupiter's Corporate Bond fund with a yield of 4.4% at the moment. For those looking for a long-term growth opportunity, Yearsley points to Aberdeen's Asia pacific fund. Though he is loathe to recommend ethical investment to anyone, he does say that two funds do tick the box of combing ethical considerations with good investment credentials. \"Jupiter Ecology and Kames Ethical Equity fund would be my picks, with the former investing globally and the latter concentrating on UK stocks,\" he says. Andy Parsons, head of investment research at The Share Centre, says investors are much less willing to take on risky funds than they once were, because of economic uncertainty. \"Three funds we believe offer investors a lower degree of risk through the management styles adopted by the fund managers are the Newton Real Return fund, the Invesco Perpetual High Income fund, and the M&amp;G Optimal Income fund,\" he says. \"All of which have the potential to deliver above market bench returns over the longer term.\" Spread your equity While investors can spread their equity Isa money across a number of different funds, up until recently there has been nothing that has allowed cash Isa savers to do the equivalent between banks and building societies. Governor Money was set up last year to offer such a service to Isas. It works like this: you open an account, let it know about any savings accounts you have and it will manage the transfer of that money into a Governor Isa account, which allows you to split your money between a number of providers in any way you want. So, you could put \u00a31,000 in a one-year fix, \u00a31,000 in a two-year fix, and the remaining \u00a33,340 in a five-year fix, for example. It doesn't currently offer any instant access Isas or regular savings. You can check the balance via your single Governer account \"wrapper\" at any time, and receive alerts about the end of any bonuses on them. Governor only works with a handful of providers, mostly building societies, and the current best buy is a three-year fix with the Saffron building society at 3.75%, which is well below the Halifax's best-buy over the same period of 4.25%. Governor is planning to increase the number of providers on its panel, however, and is continually negotiating deals to offer rates it says are always near the top of savings accounts. Earlier this year it topped the best-buy tables with a three-year fix paying 4%, so it's one to keep an eye on. \u2022 Check the latest cash Isa deals here \u2022 Use the Guardian's fund supermarket and financial advice tool to search for the best Isas"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
