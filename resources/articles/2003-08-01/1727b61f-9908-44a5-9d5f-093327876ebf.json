Few, however, would spare a cent for the chances of Denise Lewis at the world championships after what they saw here. In temperatures of more than 100 degrees Britain's Olympic heptathlon champion finished last in the long jump, one of her strongest events, raising the possibility that she may not even travel to Paris when the championships open next week. Lewis managed only 6.06 metres, 63 centimetres below her best, in a competition won by Jamaica's Eva Goulbourne with 6.77m. It was a disappointing performance by the 30-year-old Birchfield athlete, who had been training in Germany with her controversial coach Ekkart Arbeit. Lewis had already admitted to having reservations about competing in the world championships, despite finishing second in last month's Euro pean Cup of Combined Events in Tallinn in what was her first heptathlon since her Olympic victory in Sydney three years ago. A world silver medallist in 1997 in Athens and again two years later in Seville, she is clearly still not fully fit for this demanding seven-event competition. A recent illness disrupted her training and she may have run out of time, although she was refusing to concede that publicly. \"I'm a bit disappointed in terms of preparation but I'm still hoping to go to Paris,\" she said afterwards. At the start of the summer Jade Johnson was considered among Britain's medal contenders for Paris after her performances last year, when she won silver medals in the Commonwealth Games and European Championships but she, too, must be having doubts after her performance here. The 23-year-old Londoner finished only seventh with 6.37m. It has been a steep decline for Johnson, who had opened her season in June with 6.69m. At least there was an encouraging performance from Kelly Holmes, whose participation in Paris had been in doubt due to a calf injury. She followed her victory over 1500m at Crystal Palace on Friday by finishing fourth in a high-quality 800m here in 1min 59.68sec, her fastest for two years. Holmes's calf injury has cleared up following treatment at the English Institute for Sport in Sheffield. \"Dr Bryan English from UK Athletics got together with other doctors and physios, who put their heads together and came up with the conclusion it could be related to my nervous system and a nerve running down from my back getting trapped and affecting a smaller muscle in my calf,\" said Holmes. \"They prescribed a series of homeopathic and anti-inflammatory injections along with an epidural and I felt immediately better.\" Holmes also took interest in the 1500m, the distance she is due to run in Paris, where Turkey's Sureyya Ayhan ran 3:59.58, the fastest time in the world this year. The European champion used her usual Radcliffe-like tactic of breaking away at the gun and simply running away from the field. \"We know what she is going to do in Paris and it's about whether we can close the gap,\" said Holmes. Mutola, the 800m winner and Holmes's training partner, kicked away from Austria's Stephanie Graf in the final 80 metres to cross the line in 1:59.01. It was her 14th consecutive victory over the distance and she is now only two races away from scooping the biggest cash prize in athletics history. Mutola must avoid defeat in the final two Golden League meetings, at Zurich on Friday and in Brussels on September 5, to become the first athlete since the inception of the series in 1998 to lay sole claim to the $1m reward. Previously it has been shared by at least two athletes. The chance offered itself as Sturrup had earlier been beaten in the 100m when her legs crumbled in the final 10 metres and she was passed by the American pair of Kelli White and Chryste Gaines. \"It was just a bad day,\" said Sturrup. \"My legs weren't working. Never mind, good luck to Maria.\" Much will now depend on how Mutola copes with the burden. \"Of course I knew what happened in the 100m and I must say I was a little bit surprised,\" she said. \"I don't want to think too much about it, because it gives additional pressure, but who would not think about $1m?\" Maurice Greene prepared for the defence of his world 100m title with his first race for five weeks, anchoring an American quartet home in the 4x100m relay, although he was being caught rapidly at the end by Joshua \"JJ\" Johnson. The performance of the meeting, though, undoubtedly came in the high jump where South Africa's Hestrie Cloete leapt to a Commonwealth record of 2.05m, the fifth highest in history."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
