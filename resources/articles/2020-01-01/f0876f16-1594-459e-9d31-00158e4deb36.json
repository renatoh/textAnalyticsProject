Gavin, the president of the university\u2019s Liberal National Club, is believed to have taken his own life in the early hours of Monday morning after videos of the protest went viral online at the weekend. In the videos Gavin and a number of other protesters are seen yelling \u201cDrag queens are not for kids\u201d at two performers at the Brisbane Square library. The club\u2019s Facebook page was inundated with comments in opposition to the protesters\u2019 actions, and the group was condemned by other students and federal MPs including the Brisbane Liberal National party MP Trevor Evans and the LNP councillor Vicki Howard. Gavin\u2019s death was confirmed on Monday afternoon. His friend Drew Pavlou, also a UQ senator, said on Twitter Wilson was \u201cat his core a very decent and kind person that cared for others\u201d. \u201cHe had his struggles and made mistakes, and it is a tragedy for us all that he ultimately succumbed to his suffering and pain.\u201d Brisbane\u2019s LNP lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said he was deeply saddened by the news, and the events of the previous two days had been \u201ctruly tragic\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s all do our best to ensure something positive comes from this tragedy.\u201d Gavin was a staunch conservative and was interviewed in 2017 about his opposition to same-sex marriage, despite being gay himself. Rainbow Families Queensland, which organised the library event, said LGBTQ+ people were at high risk of suicide, which is why it promoted programs such as Safe Schools and drag storytime. The University of Queensland said it was providing support for staff and students. \u201cMutual respect and diversity are core values of the university, and we hope that everyone shows consideration for those affected during the difficult days ahead,\u201d a spokeswoman said. The Liberal National Club was disendorsed by the LNP in December, and on Monday night the UQ Liberal National Club Facebook page was deleted. Some politicians, including the state LNP MP Mark Robinson and the federal LNP MP George Christensen, linked Gavin\u2019s death to the reaction on social media. \u201cTwitter is broken,\u201d Christensen said in a tweet before deactivating his Twitter account. \u201cIt\u2019s for ad hominem attacks &amp; pile-ons, not real discourse. And it\u2019s aided and abetted by the media.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the UK and Irish Republic, contact Samaritans on 116 123.
