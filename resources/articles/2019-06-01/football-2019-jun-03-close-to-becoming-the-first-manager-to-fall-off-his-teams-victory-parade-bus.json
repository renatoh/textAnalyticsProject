To put that in context, a comparatively paltry 250,000 protestors are expected to converge on the streets of London (population: eight million) to ridicule, mock and barrack the obnoxious, lying, narcissist Donald Trump on his official visit to the UK. While the Fiver\u2019s not so good at sums, even we can tell this proves a hell of a lot more UK citizens chose to turn up to show their appreciation for Klopp and his players than can be bothered to demonstrate their contempt for the current president of the USA. And when you consider just how deeply unpopular that particular whinging, narcissistic man-baby is, you\u2019ve got to say Liverpool\u2019s win has been very well received indeed. While POTUS whiled away the minutes between touching down in Airforce One and stepping on to the tarmac firing off angry, abusive tweets about the Mayor of London and CNN, Klopp appeared to make better use of his time when Big Cup VI was winging its way from Madrid to Merseyside. Over-served and well refreshed, the Liverpool manager will probably forgive The Fiver for suggesting he may have been completely paralytic by the time the victory parade got under way and sat giggling to himself, swigging from a bottle of lager, singing Salt-N-Pepa songs and coming perilously close to becoming the first manager in football history to meet a grisly end by falling off the top deck of his own team\u2019s open-top victory parade bus. \u201cI cannot really describe it because I cried a little bit as well because it\u2019s so overwhelming what the people are doing,\u201d said a tired and very emotional Klopp. \u201cWhen you have a direct eye contact and you see how much it means to them that\u2019s touching to be honest. It\u2019s brilliant.\u201d Meanwhile in the Spurs camp, things were more melancholy although their likeable manager was as gracious in defeat as the aforementioned American president is ungracious in ... well, everything. \u201cIt is so painful but at the same time we have to be calm and be proud,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to congratulate Liverpool too. They did a fantastic season. You want to experience this again and repeat it. It is the best game in the world after the World Cup.\u201d The biggest, maybe, but while Liverpool fans won\u2019t care, the decidedly dreary spectacle that unfolded on the pitch on Madrid on Saturday certainly couldn\u2019t be accused of being anywhere near the best. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019m sorry but he was over the hill\u201d \u2013 Louis van Gaal gets his chat on with Big Website about Wayne Rooney, Manchester United, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and \u2026 well, let\u2019s just say he\u2019s getting quite a lot off his chest here. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Max got everyone out of bed early again to record the pod, so the least you can do is listen. FIVER LETTERS \u201cThese beauties are still on sale for an eye-watering \u00a355, I\u2019m predicting they\u2019ll be down to \u00a35 by the end of the week\u201d \u2013 Tony Crawford. \u201cHaving printed his letter twice last week, it\u2019s third time lucky for Johnny Connelly and his quest for prizeless letter o\u2019 the day on Monday then. Admittedly it is an amusing viewpoint\u201d \u2013 Johnny Mac. \u201cLetter for publication: Uefa are to be commended for their noble mitigation of fan attendance at Big Vase final. Who\u2019d have thought that the lion\u2019s share of the 2,800 mile journey would be due to the pitch being roughly 2,400 miles away from the stand? A rare win for the armchair pundits on this occasion, provided you managed to avoid the vertigo brought on by the funny camera angles\u201d \u2013 Joe Lowry.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS The Leyton Orient manager Justin Edinburgh is in hospital after unexpectedly falling ill. European Leagues chief suit Lars-Christer Olsson reckons Uefa should take a gigantic jug of cold water and pour it all over greedy clubs\u2019 plans to reshape Big Cup. \u201cThis closed shop is a proposal for the richest clubs to get even wealthier. This is an attempt to form a super league, absolutely,\u201d he roared. West Ham have increased their bid for Barcelona dreamboat Andr\u00e9 Gomes to \u00a320m in the hope that he will choose them over Everton or whoever else went weak at the knees watching him last season. Wydad Casablanca want Caf to investigate the controversial end to the African Big Cup final which was awarded to Esp\u00e9rance after Wydad players refused to play on when VAR was not consulted over a decision to disallow a possible equaliser. \u201cWe are calling for a fair investigation to save the image of football in Africa which was terribly tarnished,\u201d fumed Wydad chief suit Sa\u00efd Naciri. And Philippe Hes, the striker who scored no goals all season for Dutch non-league side AFC Amsterdam, has responded to videos from Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Ruud Gullit and other footballing luminaries who poked fun at him after being egged on by AFC players. \u201cI think the films are very funny, but they are also d!cks,\u201d he parped.

And Suzanne has also written this fine piece on the tournament as a whole, and why it is harder than ever to pick a winner for the most anticipated World Cup in history, as well as an article on England and why a win a decade ago could play a big part in 2019. Basically, she\u2019s been quite busy. Oh, and do tell us your hopes, dreams, fears and thoughts for the tournament in France, via this handy online form.
