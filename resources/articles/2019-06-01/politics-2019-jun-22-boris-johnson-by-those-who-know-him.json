Boris Johnson by those who know him", "bodyText": "After the Guardian reported that police were called to Boris Johnson\u2019s home after neighbours heard an altercation with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds, questions were again raised about the would-be Conservative leader\u2019s character. Ever since he became a politician, there have been questions over Johnson\u2019s colourful private life \u2013 though he has had as many enthusiastic cheerleaders, who argue that his flaws pale in comparison to his charismatic appeal to the public. Johnson has sought to downplay concerns over his past behaviour in his few media appearances during the campaign to date, referring to one journalist\u2019s question listing concerns that he was untrustworthy as a \u201cgreat minestrone of observations\u201d. But over the years, many of those who have known him well have questioned his suitability for high office: \u201cBoris, well, he\u2019s the life and soul of the party but he\u2019s not the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening.\u201d Cabinet minister Amber Rudd, speaking during a 2016 debate before the Brexit referendum \u201cIt is a common mistake to suppose Johnson a nice man. In reality he often behaves unpleasantly.\u201d Max Hastings, Johnson\u2019s editor at the Daily Telegraph, in a 2018 column for the Times \u201c[He is] much diminished in terms of integrity, in terms of political courage and in terms of credibility\u2026 I used to think he would be fantastic at Number 10 but those days look a long time ago.\u201d 2018 BBC interview with Guto Harri, director of communications for Johnson\u2019s mayoral administration, 2008-2012 \u201cI wanted to help build a team behind Boris Johnson so that a politician who argued for leaving the European Union could lead us to a better future. But I have come, reluctantly, to the conclusion that Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead.\u201d Michael Gove, launching the leadership bid that derailed Johnson\u2019s attempt to become prime minister in 2016 \u201c[Johnson is] a man who waits to see the way the crowd is running and then dashes in front and says, \u2018Follow me\u2019.\u201d Michael Heseltine, Good Morning Britain interview in 2018 \u201cThe Johnsonian creed [is] that it is, in his own words, acceptable, sometimes desirable to lie. Certainly that approach has been advantageous to him. But it must come at a price.\u201d Sonia Purnell, Johnson\u2019s biographer and one-time deputy in the Telegraph\u2019s Brussels bureau, writing after he withdrew from the leadership race in 2016 \u201cHe\u2019s lied his way through life, he\u2019s lied his way through politics, he\u2019s a huckster with a degree of charm to which I am immune. As well as being mendacious he\u2019s incompetent.\u201d Conservative former minister Chris Patten in May interview with Bloomberg \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s shown, especially during his period as foreign secretary, that he doesn\u2019t have the necessary skills and capacity [to be leader].\u201d Conservative MP and former attorney general Dominic Grieve in May interview with LBC \u201cHe\u2019s an enormous character but not a team player\u2026 And he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s a journalist or a politician, but he does know it\u2019s all about him. The more he repeats what everyone can see is not credible, the more his own credibility disappears.\u201d Former foreign office colleague Sir Alan Duncan, 2018 interview with the Times \u201cThe worst foreign secretary we\u2019ve ever had... Disinterested and out of his depth he cared nothing for our situation. Good riddance.\u201d John McKendrick, attorney general of Anguilla, bidding farewell to Johnson as foreign secretary with criticism of his response to the British Overseas Territory\u2019s devastation during Hurricane Irma in 2017 \u201cI think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else.\u201d Johnson\u2019s Eton housemaster, Martin Hammond, in 1982 school report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
