One is surprised not that it is done well, but that it is done at all. The PM walks the walk and talks the talk, but it is patently obvious that he knows nothing at all about the stuff. This, remember, is a guy who once tried to order flowers for his wife on the Internet - and failed. Still, we don't choose Prime Ministers on the basis of their keyboard skills. Given that New Labour has been obsessed with 'modernisation' ever since its emergence as a political force, it was inevitable that it would find the internet irresistible. And so it proved, with Downing Street and the Cabinet Office pumping out windy phrases about making Britain the most 'e-friendly' country in the world, the appointment of an 'e-envoy' and a deluge of hooey composed by picking words and adding the 'e-' prefix - as in 'eGovernment', 'eLearning', 'eDemocracy' - and, now, 'eSummit'. At the eSummit in London last week, Blair was in his rhetorical element, promising to give every school, university, hospital and doctor's surgery a high-speed link to the internet. (The fact that universities have had such high-speed links for 20 years seems to have passed him by.) Like a sinner who has suddenly got religion, the Prime Minister now has an eAnswer for every question. It's called Broadband, and it is apparently etched on the Prime Ministerial heart. It explains, for example, why the Government is spending more than \u00a31 billion on broadband for key public services over the next three years as part of a \u00a36bn investment in information technology. A rosy future - in which, for example, ambulance crews will be able to carry out roadside heart surgery guided by surgeons communicating over broadband links - beckons. 'Britain', gushed Blair, 'has the potential to become a technological powerhouse.' And to prove it, he unveiled a government report which claims that 'the UK is now the second-best place in the world to do e-business after the US.' The report was compiled by Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), a consulting firm, which was commissioned to develop an international 'benchmarking framework' and compare the UK e-economy against those of the G7 countries plus Australia and Sweden. The consultants were asked to assess the UK's progress towards New Labour's dream of becoming 'the best environment in the world for e-commerce', to explain why some countries have done better in particular areas, and 'to identify and share best practice policies'. On closer inspection, the BAH report does not seem to justify Blair's childish delight. On the one hand, it concludes that the UK is relatively strong in its market and in the readiness of its business community and government for online transactions. On the other, it tells us that the UK is relatively weak in the extent to which citizens and government have taken to e-commerce; and it points out that the country still has an 'inadequate' information infrastructure. For inadequate read abysmal. Koreans have better access to the net than we do. Britain is paying the price of BT's reluctance - or inability - to roll out broadband access on anything other than a piecemeal basis. So there was a satisfying touch of schadenfreude in the revelation that Pierre Danon, the BT board director responsible for broadband, cannot get an ADSL connection from his own home and is unlikely ever to get one via the telephone network. But the most reassuring discovery of all was that Andrew Pinder - the 'eEnvoy' charged with dragging Britain, kicking and screaming, into the online world - is likewise unable to get broadband from home.
