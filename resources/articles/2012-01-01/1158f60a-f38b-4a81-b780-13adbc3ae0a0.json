We have plans to kickstart the economy here, said Dave. But clearly it was something of an effort for the PM, navigating his way past the Watford Gap. Prepare yourselves, said the breathless press release from Downing Street. The prime minister is on his way to the \"north-east\". And on Monday our geographically confused PM and his staff pitched up in Leeds. \u2022 Wise words meanwhile, from Kirsty Young, the formidable presenter of Desert Island Discs. She tells the Radio Times of her determination to succeed on her own terms. \"Here's the thing: I know I didn't get the job (at Channel 5) because of my looks, which are average, but because they thought I could do the job ... The idea that you have to be young and beautiful to be on TV is boring.\" That's her view. It is for others to agree or disagree. But given her clear stance, one wonders what she would like to have said during her Desert Island encounter the other day with that dear friend of this diary, the writer, historian and sexual adventurer Paul \"Spanker\" Johnson. \"I wish the audience could see you now,\" he said. \"This pretty young thing I'm talking to. I wish they could see you ... sitting there in your polka dot shirt. So pretty.\" Her response: a momentary silence and a stern look, no doubt. That probably got him going too. \u2022 The shock rise of Bernard Hogan-Howe to the pinnacle of British policing was always likely to have seismic consequences. Don't think you can sleep easily in your beds, the Met's new hard man warned the remaining Stephen Lawrence murder suspects. But he might just as logically have been referring to colleagues at Scotland Yard for \u2013 one way or another, whether for advancement or sanctuary \u2013 the turn-over has been startling. Since his arrival, Assistant Commissioner Ian McPherson, has opted for life in the private sector, Tim Godwin, who was in charge during last summer riots, has gone to shake the money tree at Accenture. And Lynne Owens, who had hands-on command during the riots, has taken the top job at Surrey. Another day, another departure, for now he is losing Scotland Yard's director of resources, Anne McMeel. She has been four years in the job and as the new commissioner has tinkered with his vast new train set, observers say they haven't always seen eye to eye. A revolving door. Takes a deal of detective work to find out who's still there. \u2022 And with fresh revelations about the tug of war between Surrey police and the News of the World over the disappearance of Milly Dowler, the phone-tapping saga turns ever more ugly. What's clear is that the paper used phone hacking as a main weapon in its armoury. But where did the idea come from? Could be that they just copied it from the telly. And not even Spooks. The greater possibility is the cult detective/magic show Jonathan Creek. A synopsis for the first ever episode, aired on BBC1 on May 10 1997, reads: \"Maddy taps into Francesca's answerphone, and discovers that she is meeting someone in the foyer of the Prince of Wales Theatre, so Maddy goes along.\" Maddy, as devotees will know, was a journalist. We never learned who her main employer was. But, with hindsight, we can guess. \u2022 Staying with the corporation, there are fresh and exciting plans to plunge the BBC into the sensitive debate on assisted suicide. I am working on a new show, reaveals Jon Plowman, the producer of Absolutely Fabulous and The Office, to students at Coventry University. He's made a comedy pilot on the subject with the working title Way to Go. Tabloid trouble guaranteed. \u2022 Finally, what price freedom of information and government transparency when officials refuse to answer quite reasonably levelled questions. In the matter of Liam Fox and his meetings with Adam Werritty at the Ministry of Defence, asked one Robin Rowe under FOI: \"Were any nibbles provided? If so, at what cost to the taxpayer?\" No response from Whitehall, and it's been two months, and so officials are now breaching the legislation. What about our right to know?
