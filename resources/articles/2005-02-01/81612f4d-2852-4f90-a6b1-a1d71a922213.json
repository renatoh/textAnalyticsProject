The shadow secretary for work and pensions says this is wrong on two counts. A Conservative government would not abolish winter fuel payments. And after four years of a Conservative government, the basic state pension would be about \u00a37 a week higher for a single pensioner, and \u00a311 a week higher for a couple - above increases in line with inflation. A picture of a gas platform in Morecambe Bay was described as being part of BG's operations when it is owned and run by Centrica (Onwards and upwards, page 17, February 16). Both companies were part of British Gas until it demerged in 1997. The person behind the new writing company Show of Strength, mentioned in a caption, page 31, My Bristol, published with the Guardian, February 21, is Sheila Hannon (not Hanson). The author of a piece headlined Stop laughing, page 22, February 26, is Paul Flynn, not Paul Flint. His email address is paulflynn71@btinternet.com We said that \"one of the last lads called up for national service\" had left the RAF in 1955. In fact, conscription in the UK did not end until 1961, and the last national servicemen was not discharged until May 1963 (Barry Lloyd Jones, obituary, page 17, February 17).
