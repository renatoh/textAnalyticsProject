The defeat continued Leicester's woeful form and left them just outside the top six, with sixth-placed Brighton due to play Charlton on Tuesday. Barnsley's win also means Huddersfield find themselves in the drop zone before they kick off against Bolton on Tuesday evening. Wolves gave their hopes of avoiding relegation a lift with a 3-2 win at Birmingham. Stephen Hunt found the net from close in before two goals by Sylvan Ebanks-Blake, one from the spot, saw them into a three-goal lead at half-time. Wade Elliott replied with a penalty and a rebound from another which was saved but that was as good as it got for Blues. \"It's absolutely ridiculous that we've had to play Saturday-Monday, it's just ridiculous,\" said the Wolves manager, Dean Saunders, who bemoaned an ankle injury to Ebanks-Blake which may have finished his season. \"Some of the teams are playing Friday-Tuesday.\" Sam Baldock scored an injury-time equaliser for the bottom club Bristol City in a 1-1 draw against Sheffield Wednesday at Ashton Gate. That cancelled out Jermaine Johnson's opener to leave City seven points adrift of safety with Wednesday just above the teams in the relegation zone on goal difference from Huddersfield. Matt Phillips's late goal saw 10-man Blackpool defeat their former manager Ian Holloway's Crystal Palace at Bloomfield Road. He fired into the top corner to earn the win after Barry Ferguson had been sent off late in the first half for a second bookable offence. \"The game's getting too soft,\" said Blackpool's manager Paul Ince. \"I felt the referee got that badly wrong.\" The result leaves fourth-placed Palace two points behind Watford and six off Hull, who face one another on Tuesday. Lewis McGugan's last-gasp penalty salvaged a point for fifth-placed Nottingham Forest at Burnley, who took the lead through a deflected shot from Junior Stanislas before McGugan was hauled down by Kevin Long in the box. Forest are two points clear of Brighton. Derby County came from behind to pick up the three points at Leeds United, who took the lead after 67 minutes through Ross McCormack only for Paul Coutts and Jake Buxton to take the game for the visitors, leading the Leeds manager, Neil Warnock, to announce his departure. Ipswich had beaten Leeds 3\u20130 on Saturday and Mick McCarthy's side followed up with a 0\u20130 draw at one of his former clubs, Millwall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
