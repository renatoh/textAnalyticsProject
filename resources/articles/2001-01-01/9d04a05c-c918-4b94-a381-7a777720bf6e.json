But he promised legislation to increase the numbers of people who receive free personal care, and said he would introduce within two years a new system of \"needs assessment\". He also announced a \"development group\" headed by health minister Malcolm Chisholm to look at ways of extending free provison of personal and nursing care. Mr McLeish's decision, announced today, ends months of speculation that he would use Scotland's devolved powers to diverge from England over the provision of long-term care. But the British Medical Association called the decision \"disappointing\" and accused the Scottish executive of \"procrastination\" over the issue. Unison called the decision \"perverse\", and the Royal College of Nursing said was it was \"disappointed that all personal care will not be made free\". In England, health ministers rejected the recommendations of the royal commission on long-term care that personal care - such as bathing, feeding and dressing of elderly patients - should be universally free. Mr McLeish hinted last October when he became first minister that he wanted to \"move forward\" on long-term care - interpreted as a sign that Scotland would go it alone and implement the commission's recommendations. But in recent weeks he has come under pressure from party colleagues at Westminster who were worried that a commitment to free personal care could fuel demands for parity from pensioners in England at a sensitive time before a general election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
