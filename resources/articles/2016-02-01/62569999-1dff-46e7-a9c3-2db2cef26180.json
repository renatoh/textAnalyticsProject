Ben Wrigglesworth announced this week on social media that he is joining Sunday\u2019s opponents after more than three years at Leicester. The Leicester assistant manager, Steve Walsh, was also linked with a move to Arsenal in December but the former England striker and Match of the Day host Lineker, who says his boyhood club\u2019s achievements so far this season have been \u201cmagical\u201d, believes Walsh is the man who deserves most credit for recruitment at the club. Asked to name his Premier League team of the season so far, Lineker said: \u201c[Christian] Fuchs, for sure. Underrated, we got him on a free transfer. I love how Arsenal nicked the wrong scout. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, for sure, Riyad Mahrez, Jamie Vardy. Four at least. \u201cSteve Walsh is the guy who found these players and bought them in,\u201d he added. \u201cI know when he found Mahrez he was sent to watch someone else and came back with Mahrez. He\u2019s done a brilliant job and that\u2019s been the large key to Leicester\u2019s success. As in all clubs, it\u2019s about the people you bring in and they\u2019ve done it on a relatively small budget compared with the giants.\u201d Even Lineker, who describes himself as \u201ca proper boyhood fan\u201d who went home and away to watch his hometown team from the age of seven, could not have dreamed what has happened to Leicester over the last few months. Ranieri\u2019s side go into Sunday\u2019s match at the Emirates with a five-point lead over the chasing pack and as the new favourites to be crowned champions for the first time. \u201cI have watched it very closely, they have done it because they have good players,\u201d said Lineker. \u201cThey have a wonderful spirit and a great dynamism and pace on the counterattack. The fact that so many players have found form at the same time, while so many of the big clubs have been inconsistent, all things considered. But it\u2019s not a fluke because it has been almost a year.\u201d He added: \u201cRight throughout the side, the two centre-backs are in many ways journeyman pros, good pros, but they have got that wonderful attitude and never-say-die spirit that has culminated in them being at the top of the league.\u201d Lineker remembers coming home from Wembley in tears after seeing Leicester lose 1-0 in the 1969 FA Cup final to Manchester City \u2013 the fourth time in 20 years that the club had finished as runners-up \u2013 so is certainly taking nothing for granted with 13 games still to play. But after promising on social media in December that he would present the first Match of the Day of next season in his underpants if they win the title, he is starting to get worried. \u201cI stupidly said that, yes. But at that stage I absolutely categorically knew that they weren\u2019t going to win the league. The nation is in trouble \u2026\u201d Vardy\u2019s rags to riches story from Stocksbridge Park Steels to top scorer in the Premier League has attracted the attention of the Hollywood producer Adrian Butchart. Yet even though he had already scored 29 goals for his country by Vardy\u2019s age, Lineker sees no reason why Leicester\u2019s current leading man cannot translate that form to the international stage. \u201cI was about pace and I didn\u2019t peak until I was mid to late 20s, so I can relate to that,\u201d Lineker, who was speaking ahead of the return of the Champions League on BT Sport, said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a regular in Leicester team until I was 21 or 22. I didn\u2019t break into the England squad until I was 24 or 25. He is a little bit later than that but he\u2019s just kept improving and that is the key. \u201cHe thinks about his game a lot, he works really hard and he has exhilarating pace. He has good touch as well. His finishing has improved a lot, which was the one part of his game a couple of years ago you\u2019d have said was his weakness but he has improved a lot and has finished consistently this season.\u201d With a 12-point lead over fifth-placed Manchester United, it seems inconceivable that Leicester will not at least qualify for next season\u2019s Champions League. Lineker does not hold out too much hope for any of England\u2019s three representatives going all the way in this year\u2019s competition, tipping Barcelona to finally end the sequence that has seen the holders fail to retain their title ever since the new format was introduced in 1992. As for whether Vardy, Mahrez and co will be lured away at the end of the season, that can wait. \u201cI was just pleased that they managed to keep the whole squad together in the January window,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about any danger in the summer \u2013 if they win the league, that\u2019ll do. They could not even exist again after that and it wouldn\u2019t matter! It\u2019s just magical what\u2019s happened.
