Gudjon Thordarson's side went into this clash knowing the omens were not good. A decent start to the season in the league was brought to a shuddering halt at Wigan last Tuesday night as they were annihilated 6-1. Paul Jewell's side followed up that result by becoming the highest-profile victims of this season's FA Cup when they were beaten at home by Canvey Island on Saturday. Lewes, of the distant Ryman League Second Division, five tiers below Stoke, arrived at the Britannia Stadium for what was technically a home game having elected to switch the tie in order to gain an estimated \u00a340,000. They probably would have hoped for a bigger crowd than the 7,000 who turned up yesterday, but the Sussex team raised the spirits of their travelling support when they nearly took an early lead to shock their more celebrated opponents. The Stoke right-back Wayne Thomas, under pressure from Chris Dicker, played the ball back to Gavin Ward, only for the Lewes midfielder to rob the goalkeeper inside the box. But he was forced too wide to slot the ball home and his attempted shot ran across the face of the goal before going out for a goal-kick. Stoke opened the scoring in the 18th minute after Lewes failed to clear J\u00fcrgen Vandeurzen's corner, allowing Brynjar Gunnarsson to flick the ball on for the captain Peter Handyside, who steered the ball home with his head. The Lewes goalkeeper Ross Standen prevented his side going further behind on the half-hour when he saved brilliantly from Bjarni Gudjonsson. The Second Division side killed off their opponents in the 57th minute with another goal fashioned from a set piece. Vandeurzen's corner was met by Gunnarsson, his thumping header speeding past Standen to book Stoke's place in the next round. Lewes nearly produced the biggest cheer of the day five minutes from time when their substitute Andy Johnson skimmed the outside of the post after getting the wrong side of Thomas, but the Stoke goal was to remain unbreached on an afternoon when their passage to the next round never looked in doubt. Thordarson admitted afterwards that his men needed to get Tuesday's Wigan result out of their system and now he believes his side can get their season back on track before facing Halifax in the next round. For the Lewes manager Jimmy Quinn there was nothing but pride to be taken from the performance of his men, whose next tie against Sidlesham in the Sussex Senior Cup, is sure to bring them back to earth with a bump. \"The money from this tie will be enough to improve our facilities and maybe ensure our ground is good enough for us to get into the next division,\" he said. \"I am just happy we gave a good account of ourselves.\" Man of the match : J\u00fcrgen Vandeurzen (Stoke)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
