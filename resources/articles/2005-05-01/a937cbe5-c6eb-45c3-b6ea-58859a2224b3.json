Perhaps he was trying to make a point to Sir Alex Ferguson's team. Reyes, named unexpectedly early by Wenger, may owe his berth to Thierry Henry's injury but it was a striking vote of confidence from the manager to announce three days before the game that he will include the former Seville player against United. He also made a point of stating that Reyes is now physically stronger and coping better with tackles. It is a tribute to Reyes's skill that on previous occasions he has been singled for special treatment by United but he likes to think he has not been targeted by Ferguson's side despite Wenger's complaint after the defeat in October. \"Players never think that but, it is true, every time I got the ball I did seem to get kicked quite a lot,\" Reyes said of this season's game at Old Trafford. \"But sometimes, you don't get kicked at all. You just don't know.\" The carry-over from that game prompted Patrick Vieira to confront Gary Neville in the tunnel at Highbury before the return in February. Vieira's support left its mark on Reyes. \"It's really nice when your own team protect you like that and more so, when it's the captain or someone like Henry,\" he said. \"It makes you feel much more part of the team.\" Wenger's unusual decision to confirm he will play the 21-year-old tomorrow, while refusing to be drawn on the starting prospects of Sol Campbell or Freddie Ljungberg, may have been designed to make a couple of points. If the first was to send a message to United that his players are not intimidated, Wenger may also have been underlining publicly to Reyes the faith he has in him. Earlier this year Reyes was tricked by a Spanish radio station into admitting he would love to return to Spain. Wenger is desperate to keep him. Reyes stated that personal issues, including the death of his grandfather, had undermined his attempts to settle in England but insisted he was a lot more comfortable now and said he expects to be at Highbury next season. \"I feel the most integrated I have done with the team,\" Reyes said. Not everyone is convinced he will remain when Real Madrid are interested, but it is far easier to imagine him staying than it was a few months ago. As winter has cleared, Reyes' form has picked up. A goal against Tottenham on April 25 visibly lifted his confidence after he had failed to make an impression at Chelsea in the previous match. \"It has been a season full of ups and downs,\" the Spain international said. \"Right now, I am passing through a good moment and, for Saturday, I have to make the most of it.\" He preferred not to talk about the radio hoax but admitted the reaction from within the club and the fans have helped him to feel wanted at Highbury. \"After that happened, it was not only the other players who made me feel very welcome but everyone at Arsenal,\" he said. \"So it's because of things like that that I am starting to feel very comfortable at the club. \"I wasn't nervous [coming into work the next day] but when I came into training, I did want to see what the reception was like. More than anything, I was worried about the fans and it was incredible, they were very nice to me.\" Having taken a few blows from Manchester United, Reyes would love to land one tomorrow that finishes them off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
