The Chilean is set to return against Leicester City on Tuesday and Wenger is confident he will remain fit for the remainder of the season. S\u00e1nchez has missed two matches with a hamstring problem, including the 2-1 defeat at Tottenham on Saturday during which Arsenal failed to spark. His return, on the back of a deserved defeat, represents a welcome boost for Arsenal who are sixth in the Premier League behind Spurs. S\u00e1nchez has scored 18 goals and Wenger will decide on Tuesday whether the player will start against the bottom club. Arsenal are without Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for at least two more weeks while Jack Wilshere\u2019s return date remains unknown. Wenger, when asked if S\u00e1nchez reminded him of any former players, said: \u201cIan Wright. He is a bit like Ian Wright. His enthusiasm, the enthusias1m of Ian Wright. He has that. He is very friendly and bubbly every day. He is quieter than Ian Wright but that is not difficult and he doesn\u2019t get booked. \u201cHe has had a bit of a winter break now, [one] that he didn\u2019t really want but he got one and I think he will now be recovered and fit until the end of the season. It was difficult for him not to play [against Spurs]. If it was the last game of the season he would have played. \u201cFor us it is important that he has no setback as once you go into February, if you have a muscular injury and a guy has a setback, you say bye, bye as the season is over as it is six weeks out. By the time you come back to your full level it is April and that is why we didn\u2019t take the gamble [of rushing him back].\u201d Wenger also questioned the clarity of Uefa\u2019s financial fair play regulations after Jos\u00e9 Mourinho suggested last week that clubs who fall foul of the rules be deducted points. Wenger said: \u201cI think we have a good sense of humour here. \u201cThe financial fair play rules have to be respected by everybody and if one club respected always the financial fair play you can underline Arsenal. \u201cIs it is just your income created by the gates? Is it the gates and commercial and then you can already start to be creative? \u201cIs it only the gates and the television? Is it naming rights as well? It is not clear to people what financial fair play means, the rules are very complicated.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
