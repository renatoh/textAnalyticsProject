Did they warn that this amount would be totally inadequate to provide a replacement service? Your report clearly says: \"Most GPs ... saw they could do out-of-hours work ... and recoup their loss within seven or eight nights.\" No surprise there then. GPs deserve to be given the option of avoiding long hours, but the BMA should have clarified the replacement service with the NHS well before the change if they truly had the concern for patients that they are now displaying.
