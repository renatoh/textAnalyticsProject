Now another local teenager has gone missing and the TV stations are lit up with the news. A search party has gathered, Facebook is in meltdown and \u201cJ day\u201d \u2013 Jessica day \u2013 has just been named. \u201cHe\u2019s probably kissing her right now,\u201d says Sam of Jessica and her kidnapper. The scary thing? There\u2019s envy nestled in there, amid the fear and sorrow. Sarah Kosar\u2019s latest play isn\u2019t easy. It doesn\u2019t always work, or even make sense. But her follow-up to Mumburger is horribly captivating and, in all its twisted eccentricity, peculiarly contemporary. There are hints of Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? as we watch Sam (Michelle Fox, electric) descend into a strange depression and, with the help of husband John (Mark Quartley), embroil brother Scotty (Nima Taleghani) in a dangerous game. There\u2019s an element of fairytale too. Sara Joyce\u2019s triumphantly disjointed production, all neon lights and jagged blackouts (bold work from Jessica Hung Han Yun), never feels quite real. Jasmine Swan\u2019s eerie dreamscape set is lined with a moat, filled with glowing stepping stones. Then there are the guns. Lots and lots of guns. Guns line the wall; they\u2019re stashed in the freezer and they\u2019re brandished in the bedroom. They offer protection and stimulation, comfort and fear. On huge screens fixed on the back wall, TV snippets flash, fracture and melt away to nothing, the mesmerising work of video designer Ash J Woodward. The footage lights up Sam\u2019s face with a ghoulish glow. Here is a world at once horribly familiar and utterly strange, where fame and depression, danger and love dance together in the spotlight. \u2022 Armadillo is at the Yard theatre, London, until 22 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
