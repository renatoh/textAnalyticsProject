Look at the North-South cards from a team match. How would you play a contract of six hearts? Game all, dealer North. The opening lead is the four of spades. The contract seems to depend on the diamond finesse, but technicians and psychologists alike are always on the lookout for extra chances. If the jack of clubs falls in three rounds, you may be able to establish two club winners in dummy to take care of South's two losing diamonds - a technical extra chance. If the diamond finesse loses, but the defenders then fail to cash the ace of clubs, South's losing club will disappear on North's long diamond - a psychological extra chance. To take advantage of the first possibility, you win the opening lead in the South hand, draw trumps and play the king of clubs. If West wins he will play a diamond and you will need the finesse, but if East wins you will have time to test the clubs before falling back on the diamonds. To take advantage of the second possibility, you should play dummy's ten of spades at trick one. East covers with the jack, but you win with the ace (not the king) and immediately finesse in diamonds - do not draw trumps, because that will give West a chance to signal in clubs or spades. If East does not have the ace of clubs, he may try to cash the wrong black-suit trick when he wins the king of diamonds, since it looks as though you may have \"misguessed\" in spades on the opening lead. At one table South was a psychologist, so he followed the second line, but when East won the king of diamonds he banged down the ace of clubs, and the contract failed. At the other table South was a technician. He won the opening spade lead, drew trumps, cashed the king and queen of spades, and only then led a club. East won with the ace, but having only minor-suit cards, he was forced to return either a club or a diamond into one of dummy's tenaces.
