Sorry, we mean, of course, Guardian Music Weekly, we have a sit down and good old-fashioned chat with Vampire Weekend. Their debut album, also called Vampire Weekend, is out this week and the band were in town playing some shows and doing some promo and generally soaking up the English hospitality. We discussed whether their LP is a \"concept album about privilege\", how their distinctive sound came about, and what J-Lo has do with their next album. Another artist whose album is propping up the shelves at Zavvi as we write is Lightspeed Champion, otherwise known as Dev Hynes. The 22-year-old singer used to make up one-third of electro-punkster Test Icicles, so it made for a pleasant surprise when he released an acoustic album all about Falling Off the Lavender Bridge. Hynes popped into the studio to play his track Dry Lips and talk about how he's coping with his new-found popularity. Furthermore, there's music from Queen of Hip-Hip Soul Mary J Blige, London quintet the Duke Spirit and new single Please Read the Letter from Robert Plant and Alison Krauss. Opinions on the worth of this week's dongles are divided between Paul MacInnes, Rosie Swash and guest pod critic Tim Jonze. There's also one more wee interview, the details of which are a huge secret and you'll have to wait until the end of the show to find out who we've been talking to, but the clue is: British Sea Power."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
