Health secretary Patricia Hewitt's strong defence of the NHS reform programme, including the use of the private sector, drew scorn from the health conference of the public sector union Unison in Gateshead. The anger was directed at both job cuts and the spread of the private sector into the NHS through the private finance initiative and independent treatment centres. Ms Hewitt refused to apologise, or withdraw her much derided claim that the NHS was enjoying its best ever year, even though she admitted she was taking stick for the assertion. Her speech came only hours after the Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, warned of strikes to fight job losses, while the Royal College of Nursing warned of an end to cooperation. The anger over the job cuts, mainly of agency staff, is frustrating Downing Street, which yesterday published figures showing an extra 87, 000 nurses have been employed since 1997, training places have doubled and the NHS workforce as a whole has risen by a third. At his monthly press conference, Tony Blair gave an upbeat assessment of the overall state of the NHS. He sprang to the defence of his health secretary, but studiously avoided repeating her claim that the NHS had had its best ever year. He said next year would be \"very challenging as the NHS changes\", but refused to reveal the internal estimate of NHS deficits, or whether he would sanction whole hospital closures as a way of controlling financial mismanagement. He ruled out fining trusts that over-spend, but said \"hospitals will have to live within their means for their first time\". He claimed the problem of deficits was concentrated in a small number of trusts, pointing out that the total size of the deficit was less than 1% of NHS turnover. He denied the Department of Health had badly underestimated the cost of GPs' contracts, although later his former advisor at Downing Street Julian Le Grand differed with him by blaming the department for giving the doctors so much extra cash and receiving little in return. Ms Hewitt, emphasising the fall in waiting times for patients, offered an uncompromising defence of her reforms, but stumbled as she was jeered for asserting that the NHS building programme based on the private finance initiative was not privatisation, but progress. She quickly apologised in a hostile question and answer session for suggesting that health assistants were not skilled workers. Ms Hewitt promised frontline services would not be affected by deficits: \"Improving financial management does not mean compromising services for patients. Any action that the NHS takes to reduce deficits should not lower the quality of care provided to patients.\" She said: \"We are bringing in the private sector not to take over from the NHS but to contribute more capacity and even more innovation.\" In a more emollient passage she said: \"We will have to face up to some difficult decisions, and we all know that there are some staff facing redundancies.\" She largely blamed poor management for failing to organise hospitals in the most efficient way, adding that in some places management owed staff an apology. The Tory leader, David Cameron, hit out at the government's \"arrogant\" manner in blaming the crisis on health chiefs. Best medicine Rather than slow handclap or heckle, delegates at the conference erupted in laughter on a number of occasions during Ms Hewitt's speech, particularly when the health secretary said: \u00b7 I know that Unison isn't against change. You helped lead the way in negotiating Agenda for Change ... which not only means higher pay for most NHS staff, but even more important, new opportunities. \u00b7 We are bringing in the private and independent sector - not to take over from the NHS but to contribute more capacity and even more innovation. \u00b7 By the end of 2008, we will effectively have abolished ... (heckler: \"The NHS\") ... waiting lists - the way the old NHS rationed care and kept within its budget. \u00b7 We're using private finance to build new hospitals, 70 already with Barts and the Royal London, St Helen's and Birmingham to follow. That's not privatisation, that's progress."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
