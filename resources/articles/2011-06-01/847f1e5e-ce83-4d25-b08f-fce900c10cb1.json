But, as the first person to act as solicitor for Richard in the 1960s in his virginal brush with the law, when he ran Student magazine, I think it would be better still had he responded to my appeal to his charitable foundation for the Prison Video Trust, a charity I'm involved in which makes educational videos for prisoners and highlights the need for programmes that seek to rehabilitate inmates, not least the thousands of drugs offenders that clutter up our prisons. The trust faces extinction because of public funding cuts, and if the relatively few publicly spirited entrepreneurs like Richard will not come to our aid, who will? Benedict Birnberg London \u2022\u2008The assertion that \"the right to intoxicate is a fundamental human right\" (Letters, 4 June) triggered a flashback to my days as a student stoner. Perhaps it also sheds some light on where all the civil libertarians were as Thatcher and Blair dismantled our freedoms to demonstrate and organise our labour \u2013 still where I left them in 1979, draped like Dal\u00ed's watches over the sofa, eating Monster Munch and waiting for the revolution.
