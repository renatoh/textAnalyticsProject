But the club\u2019s director of rugby acknowledged the turmoil his star player is enduring. \u201cHe\u2019s a human being, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said McCall. \u201cHe\u2019s also very keen to do well for his teammates. He\u2019s a great team man and a great club man. I thought he did very well [today against Bristol] but I\u2019m sure there was a lot of stuff going on in his head.\u201d McCall would not be drawn on his own views but confirmed the club would be dealing with the matter internally. \u201cWe haven\u2019t sat down with him as a club. I\u2019ll talk to him myself but the club will talk to him as well in due course. I don\u2019t want to get dragged into this. I\u2019m not going to give my opinion. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll keep referring to the club statement. I don\u2019t think my opinion is particularly relevant.\u201d Saracens resisted the temptation to pull Vunipola from the squad, having picked him on the bench earlier in the week, ahead of next weekend\u2019s date with Munster in the Champions Cup semi-final. \u201cBilly didn\u2019t play last week. The decision to select him was made before what happened happened. We saw no reason not to keep him in the squad.\u201d Bristol\u2019s director of rugby, Pat Lam, is a fellow Pacific Islander, likewise guided by his faith. \u201cThe number one thing that I know with my faith is,\u201d he said, \u201cJesus is very clear \u2013 I\u2019m not here to judge anyone. I\u2019ll judge their performances later as a rugby coach, but I\u2019m not going to judge anyone or what anyone does. It\u2019s about what I do, about my relationship with the big feller, how I treat people - and that\u2019s all I can control. I\u2019m not going to judge anybody on their views or beliefs.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
