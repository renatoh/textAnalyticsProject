Her parents took her to an airport near where they lived in New Mexico and she got up close to a Douglas DC-3, an early airliner. \u201cI go right to the wheel and I try to turn the nut,\u201d she says. \u201cMother said: \u2018She\u2019s going to fly.\u2019\u201d Just over 20 years later, in 1961, Funk\u2019s mother dropped her off at a clinic in Albuquerque, where she became the youngest participant in a programme to test whether the US\u2019s best female pilots could become astronauts. She didn\u2019t make it into space, but, nearly six decades on, she is still trying. We meet at the home of Funk\u2019s friend, the journalist Sue Nelson, who has written a wonderful book about her. Funk is 80, straight-backed and sparkling. She is dressed in a black shirt embroidered with \u201cWally\u201d on one side and the logo from the organisation Women in Aviation International on the other, neatly tucked into black trousers on which she has sewn a patch for SpaceShipTwo \u2013 Virgin Galactic\u2019s suborbital plane. Funk spent $200,000 on a ticket in 2010 and is still waiting for the opportunity to use it. She talks energetically and loudly, and you have to speak up if you want her to hear you, thanks to a lifetime spent near plane engines. She is unlike anyone I have ever met. \u201cOK, lay it on me,\u201d she says, fixing me with a direct look. Mary Wallace Funk was born in 1939. She grew up in Taos, a town in New Mexico, where her parents ran a chain of shops and let her run wild. She grew up riding her bike or her horse, skiing, hunting and fishing. When she was 14, the National Rifle Association sent her incredible shooting results to the president, Dwight Eisenhower, and he wrote back to her. \u201cI did everything that people didn\u2019t expect a girl to do,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was nothing I couldn\u2019t do.\u201d She was expected to be home, washed and wearing a dress every evening for dinner, but other than that they encouraged her outdoors nature. When she wanted to build a treehouse, her father got her the tools. \u201cToday\u2019s kids wouldn\u2019t know what to think of it,\u201d she says. Funk didn\u2019t give the idea of space much thought, but she wanted to fly. By the time she was seven, she was making planes from balsa wood. At nine, she had her first flying lesson. She remembers \u201cthe air and how pretty it was, and how the ground looked. It was probably all of 15 minutes.\u201d She didn\u2019t fly again until her teens, when she enrolled at Stephens College in Missouri and got her flying licence. She went on to study education at Oklahoma State University, mainly because it had an aviation team known as the Flying Aggies. \u201cAs a Flying Aggie, I could do all the manoeuvres as well as the boys, if not better,\u201d she says. After that, she became a flight instructor \u2013 the only female one \u2013 at a US military base. Then Funk read an article about the Woman in Space Program, run by William Randolph Lovelace. A doctor who had worked on Project Mercury, Nasa\u2019s drive to put a man into orbit around the Earth, Lovelace launched this privately funded programme to discover if women were as able as men. Funk contacted him, detailing her experience and achievements. Despite being underage \u2013 the women were supposed to be between 25 and 40; she was 22 \u2013 she was invited to take part. \u201cThe first day, they said: \u2018Come in, don\u2019t drink, don\u2019t eat,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe first thing they do is temperature, take all the blood tests they can, and then I was put in a chair, strapped in, and they inject [ice-cold] water into my ear.\u201d The test, which was intended to induce vertigo so that the scientists could record how the participants dealt with it, was painful, but Funk says she was taught never to give in to discomfort. The other woman being tested that day dropped out within hours, so Funk spent the rest of the week on her own. \u201cI took it. I can take anything. You can whip me and it won\u2019t bother me.\u201d She was taken to another room to relax, then brought back in so they could do the other ear. \u201cI think I said: \u2018Wow.\u2019 They unstrapped me, I wasn\u2019t dizzy, I was normal.\u201d For the rest of the week, \u201cnot only did they poke needles in me all the time, but tubes were poked down me and stuck up me. For what reason, I have no idea.\u201d One of the tests involved floating in the dark in a sensory-deprivation tank. \u201cI turned my brain off and I went up into the heavens,\u201d she says. \u201cI lay there and lay there. Pretty soon \u2013 many hours later, although I had no knowledge of time \u2013 a voice came over and said: \u2018Wally, do you need to go to the bathroom?\u2019 and I said: \u2018I\u2019ve already done that.\u2019\u201d She laughs. \u201cThey said: \u2018OK, how do you feel?\u2019 I said: \u2018I feel great!\u2019 Then silence. And that\u2019s the way I sleep today.\u201d She spread-eagles her arms and legs and says: \u201cYou will sleep better.\u201d When she came out, she was told she had been in there for 10 hours and 35 minutes and broken the record. \u201cI said: \u2018Good. Whatever you want to do, keep on doing it.\u2019\u201d There were numerous x-rays and a brain scan. Some of the tests were brutal \u2013 one included swallowing a 3ft-long rubber tube to examine her stomach. Did she ever feel like giving up? \u201cOh, heavens, no. Higher, faster, longer \u2013 that is my motto. I can go out there and do anything.\u201d Did she think she would become an astronaut? \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Funk and 12 other women \u2013 who became known as the Mercury 13 \u2013 passed and were put forward for the next phase of testing. But then the programme, which was not sanctioned by Nasa, was cancelled after doubts were raised about whether women should even be taking part in such a thing. Two of the 13 pleaded their case at a congressional subcommittee meeting; one of those testifying against them was the astronaut John Glenn, who said including women in the space programme \u201cmay be undesirable\u201d. How did she feel when it ended? \u201cWell, it\u2019s not going to stop me. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Wasn\u2019t she disappointed? \u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of a life. I\u2019m a positive person. Things were cancelled? So what? Wally\u2019s going on. Why are people so negative? I\u2019m not a quitter.\u201d For the next few years, she sought out more tests to prove her capability. \u201cEvery test I took I exceeded,\u201d she says. \u201cI took probably about six or seven different tests throughout the US. Then I went to Russia and took the cosmonaut tests. I beat all the guys.\u201d She wrote repeatedly to Nasa to try to get on one of its training programmes, but she was told she couldn\u2019t because she didn\u2019t have an engineering degree. \u201cI was living in Ohio somewhere and I went to the college and I went to the head guy and said: \u2018I want to come in and get my engineering degree,\u2019 and he hit me like that, hard.\u201d She gets up and swats at my shoulder. \u201cHe said: \u2018You\u2019re a girl \u2013 go to home ec.\u2019\u201d She continued working as a flight instructor and later became the first female investigator for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), looking into plane crashes. Did she ever feel intimidated in these all-male environments? \u201cWhy would I? I\u2019ve never been intimidated by anybody. When I was with the FAA and a guy got a little too close to my desk and he tried to touch me, I got up and walked out. I came back and told my secretary about it; he was fired the next day.\u201d Was there ever a point when she thought trying to become an astronaut wasn\u2019t working? \u201cNo, I never thought that,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me questions that are negative. I never had anything negative.\u201d She experienced weightlessness on a parabolic flight when she was 61. But is she worried she won\u2019t live to use her Virgin Galactic ticket, given that Richard Branson\u2019s project has suffered years of setbacks? \u201cI don\u2019t worry about anything, honey. You have never spoken to anybody like me, have you?\u201d She smiles kindly. \u201cI\u2019m positive \u2013 there\u2019s no worry. I will get up there somehow.\u201d Hers is an extraordinary life. \u201cExquisite,\u201d she calls it. We barely have time to touch on the two and a half years she spent travelling around Europe and Africa in a camper van with only a poodle and a chipmunk for company. The photographs she shows me become more and more outlandish \u2013 here she is with her first plane, a Stearman biplane; there is the house she built herself; here she is, riding an alligator. Funk had relationships, but boyfriends \u201cdidn\u2019t show me much\u201d. She never wanted children. \u201cI\u2019m not a person who likes kids,\u201d she says, then clarifies: \u201cI\u2019m talking about babies. I have never really held a baby in my life. Do you know how many people I know now, in different organisations, who are so busy with husbands and kids and school and homework? I\u2019m just so glad I don\u2019t have to mess with any of that.\u201d She wears a band engraved with wings on her ring finger. Funk still flies every Saturday, instructing people. Can she see a time when she will have to stop? \u201cNo!\u201d she shouts. \u201cI\u2019ll be flying \u2019til I die.\u201d As for making it into space, it feels almost a given that Funk, unstoppable as a rocket, will get there.
