Stay with us as we cover the Democratic debates tonight here. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus condemned the vote to pass the border aid bill in a statement on Thursday saying, \u201cwe will not forget this betrayal.\u201d \u201cIt will not stop the Trump Administration\u2019s chaos and cruelty. It will not stop the abuse and detention of children.\u201d Rep. Ilhan Omar condemned the House\u2019s passage of the border spending bill: \u201cWe had an opportunity to put forth a humanitarian policy and we wasted that opportunity, and it\u2019s quite sad. And I hope that Americans are as appalled as I am,\u201d she said. New York mayor and 2020 presidential candidate Bill de Blasio is facing backlash for quoting the late Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara at a rally in Miami on Thursday. De Blasio encouraged workers on strike at the airport there and then shouted, \u201cHasta la victoria, siempre,\u201d a phrase popularized by Guevara and popularized during the Cuban revolution that roughly translates to \u201cuntil victory, always!\u201d De Blasio was criticized for invoking such a controversial historical figurehead who is \u201cconsidered a murderous sociopath by Miami\u2019s Cuban exile community,\u201d according to the Miami Herald. De Blasio has since apologized. \u201cI did not know the phrase I used in Miami today was associated with Che Guevara &amp; I did not mean to offend anyone who heard it that way. I certainly apologize for not understanding that history,\u201d de Blasio wrote on Twitter. Texas Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar called for a moment of silence on the House floor Thursday for migrants who have died trying to reach the United States. She referenced the shocking photo circulating this week of Salvadoran migrants Oscar Alberto Martinez and his daughter Angie Valera, who died while crossing the Rio Grande. From CNN: \u201cThe photograph that all of us saw this week should tear all of us up,\u201d said the congresswoman form Texas\u2019 16th Congressional District, which includes El Paso.\u201dFor those of us who are parents, to see a toddler with her little arms wrapped around the neck of her father,\u201d Escobar said, adding \u201cthere is nothing that we wouldn\u2019t do for our children, nothing, to give them a better life. \u201cOscar and Valeria represent tens of thousands of migrants who have died as they have tried to build a better life for themselves, only to find that they are demonized and locked out of the promise that those of us who are natural born citizens are so fortunate to enjoy,\u201d Escobar said.\u201dIn their name, let us never forget their sacrifice and the sacrifice that so many parents make for the most vulnerable among us.\u201d From the Associated Press: The Democratic-controlled House voted Thursday to send President Donald Trump a bipartisan, Senate-drafted, $4.6 billion measure to care for migrant refugees detained at the southern border, capping a Washington skirmish in which die-hard liberals came out on the losing end in a battle with the White House, the GOP-held Senate and Democratic moderates. The emergency legislation, required to ease overcrowded, often harsh conditions at U.S. holding facilities for migrants seeking asylum, mostly from Central American nations like Honduras and El Salvador, passed by a bipartisan 305-102 vote. Trump has indicated he\u2019ll sign it into law. Dozens of liberal Democrats opposed the bill, reluctantly brought to a vote by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., after her plan to further strengthen rules for treatment of migrant refugees ran into intractable opposition from Republicans and Vice President Mike Pence. Many moderate Democrats split with Pelosi as well, undercutting her efforts, which faded shortly after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he would swiftly reject them. The legislation contains more than $1 billion to shelter and feed migrants detained by the border patrol and almost $3 billion to care for unaccompanied migrant children who are turned over the Department of Health and Human Services. It rejects an administration request for additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds, however, and contains provisions designed to prevent federal immigration agents from going after immigrants living in the country illegally who seek to care for unaccompanied children. Hello readers, Kari Paul in San Francisco hopping on the blog for a bit. More news to come. Thanks for joining us so far today \u2013 here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: The Supreme Court walled itself off from partisan gerrymandering cases, ruing that \u201cpartisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts.\u201d In a blistering dissent, justice Elena Kagan said, \u201cFor the first time ever, this court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities.\u201d Pro-democracy advocates said the ruling would be a \u201cgreen light\u201d for party insiders to engage in partisan gerrymandering, with disastrous results for voters. In a separate ruling, the court rejected a Trump administration attempt to insert a citizenship question on the US Census, saying the administration\u2019s stated rationale for the move didn\u2019t make sense. In reply, Donald Trump said he was looking into delaying the Census so his team could have another crack at a move which critics say would disenfranchise Democratic-leaning voters. In non-Supreme-Court-news, the House Democratic leadership dropped its opposition to a Senate bill to fund aid on the southern border, which Democrats previously said did not do enough to help kids and families. But the left wing of the party criticized the move which they saw as a cave. \u201cHell no,\u201d tweeted Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort pleaded not guilty to state-level mortgage fraud charges. He\u2019s in prison after convictions on different fraud charges he previously pleaded not guilty to. Anticipation was building for tonight\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, the second in a series featuring a fresh crop of candidates. Senator Cory Booker is getting razzed, deservedly, for the typographic layout of quotes he\u2019s tweeting of things he said last night: Democrats on the left in the House \u2013 more than 70 of them (the Democrats currently hold a 235-198 majority) \u2013 are not pleased with the leadership\u2019s decision to abandon opposition to the bipartisan Senate border funding bill. Here is an edited extract from Justice Elena Kagan\u2019s searing dissent in the partisan gerrymandering case (you can read the full dissent here): \u2018Partisan gerrymanders have debased and dishonored our democracy\u2019 For the first time ever, this court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities. And not just any constitutional violation. The partisan gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most fundamental of their constitutional rights: the rights to participate equally in the political process, to join with others to advance political beliefs, and to choose their political representatives. In so doing, the partisan gerrymanders here debased and dishonored our democracy, turning upside-down the core American idea that all governmental power derives from the people. These gerrymanders enabled politicians to entrench themselves in office as against voters\u2019 preferences. They promoted partisanship above respect for the popular will. They encouraged a politics of polarization and dysfunction. If left unchecked, gerrymanders like the ones here may irreparably damage our system of government. And checking them is not beyond the courts. The majority\u2019s abdication comes just when courts across the country have coalesced around manageable judicial standards to resolve partisan gerrymandering claims. Those standards satisfy the majority\u2019s own benchmarks. They do not require \u2013 indeed, they do not permit \u2013 courts to rely on their own ideas of electoral fairness, whether proportional representation or any other. And they limit courts to correcting only egregious gerrymanders, so judges do not become omnipresent players in the political process. But yes, the standards do allow \u2013 as well they should \u2013 judicial intervention in the worst-of-the-worst cases of democratic subversion, causing blatant constitutional harms. In other words, they allow courts to undo partisan gerrymanders of the kind we face today from North Carolina and Maryland. In giving such gerrymanders a pass from judicial review, the majority goes tragically wrong. Read further: You can read the full dissent here. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez weighs in on the speaker\u2019s announcement that the House will pass the senate bill: House speaker Nancy Pelosi has said Democrats will \u201creluctantly\u201d pass a bipartisan Senate bill funding emergency aid at the southern border. The House leadership had argued that the Senate package did not go far enough to care for thousands of migrant families and children. The troops did not rally: \u201cIn one of the most awkward moments of his time as U.S. secretary of state, Rex Tillerson realized his Mexican counterpart was in Washington only when he walked into a restaurant and found him dining with President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner,\u201d Reuters reports: On another occasion, neither Tillerson nor Jim Mattis, who was then secretary of defense, knew Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates planned to blockade their regional rival Qatar even though Kushner and another Trump adviser, Steve Bannon, had been told about it at a secret dinner with their governments. Tillerson recounted the embarrassing incidents in a seven-hour closed-door interview with leaders of the House of Representatives\u2019 Foreign Affairs Committee last month. Trump fired Tillerson in March 2018 after months of friction and on Twitter called him lazy and \u201cdumb as a rock.\u201d Tillerson\u2019s testimony, a transcript of which was seen by Reuters House of Representatives\u2019 Foreign Affairs Committee, shows how Tillerson\u2019s 13-month tenure as secretary of state, one of the shortest ever, was undermined by public disagreements with Trump and a sense that the former ExxonMobil chief executive was being excluded from key discussions. Read further. President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman has pleaded not guilty to state mortgage fraud charges in New York City, the AP reports. In a previous case, Manafort pleaded not guilty to federal fraud charges, but he was convicted by a jury. Here\u2019s AP with more: Paul Manafort entered the plea at an arraignment Thursday in Manhattan. Manafort walked with a limp as court officers led him down a public hallway to the courtroom. He wore a blue jail uniform. The state case could keep Manafort locked up in the event Trump pardons his federal convictions stemming from the Russian probe. Manafort\u2019s lawyers are expected to challenge the state case on double jeopardy grounds. Prosecutors say their case is solid because it involves state, not federal crimes. Manafort, 69, is currently serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence on federal charges of tax and computer fraud and money laundering. University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck points out that during arguments in the citizenship/Census case, the government repeatedly rebutted requests for more time from the challengers by insisting that a deadline to finalize the Census was nigh: Here\u2019s some reactions to the president. In reaction to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling Thursday that the commerce department was not within its rights to add a citizenship question to the 2020 US Census under its proposed rationale, Donald Trump has asked lawyers if the census can be delayed so the question can be inserted, he tweeted. Does the president have the power to delay the US Census because he disagrees with a Supreme Court decision? If only there were a founding document to resolve such clashes between branches of government. Kidding and yes let\u2019s look at the constitution on this: But apart from Trump\u2019s provocative suggestion that the count be delayed, his tweets here are doing the familiar work of changing the facts on the ground in a bid to change them. The court did not throw out the administration\u2019s bid to add a citizenship question because the court felt it needed \u201cadditional information,\u201d as Trump suggests. The court threw out the bid because it found the commerce department\u2019s rationale for adding the question to be bushwa (or, in chief justice Roberts\u2019 assessment, not \u201creasonable\u201d). \u201cReasoned decision-making under the Administrative Procedure Act calls for an explanation for agency action,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cWhat was provided here was more of a distraction.\u201d It appears the Trump administration may attempt a second bid to insert the question using different reasoning. We included this tweet in the blog earlier but it does seem to strike the nail on the head: If you missed last night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, fear not \u2013 there\u2019s another one on tonight. With different candidates onstage this time, but will anyone notice? Tonight we will have onstage: Former vice president Joe Biden Vermont senator Bernie Sanders California senator Kamala Harris South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand Colorado senator Michael Bennet Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper California congressman Eric Swalwell Entrepreneur Andrew Yang Author Marianne Williamson For more about what to expect tonight, read on: If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, we hereby recommend David Daley\u2019s weekend essay, \u201cThe real reason Republicans are so interested in the census\u201d. From the essay: If you want to understand the real purpose of Republican proposals to add a citizenship question to the US census, a good place to start is last November\u2019s Texas state house elections. Democrats captured 12 seats in Texas\u2019s lower chamber, propelled by long-simmering demographic changes that have made this red state less white, rural, and conservative. The Republican party\u2019s enormous majority has commensurately crumbled: a 101-49 advantage in 2011 has now been sliced to a narrow 83-67. That slight edge could easily evaporate by the mid-2020s. The master Republican strategist Thomas Hofeller didn\u2019t live to see those dramatic results. He died three months earlier, in August 2018. He anticipated them, however, and left behind a simple yet sophisticated plan to hold back the new face of Texas and keep state government in Republican hands regardless of demographic changes. The citizenship question would be the sandbag. Continue reading: Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is serving a seven-and-a-half year prison sentence on federal fraud charges, appeared in court this morning in New York to face state-level mortgage fraud charges and other crimes. Congress is at a standoff over a $4.6bn aid package for the southern border as House Democrats say a Senate-passed measure doesn\u2019t go far enough to care for thousands of migrant families and children, the AP reports: Speaker Nancy Pelosi is considering a fresh vote Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re not making predictions, threats, or anything else. We\u2019re just saying this is a moral imperative for us to do the right thing for the children,\u201d Pelosi said Thursday morning. Democrats want to add more protections for the children including medical and hygiene standards at facilities, and a requirement that any death of a minor be reported within 24 hours. Democratic leaders will convene early Thursday and Pelosi\u2019s spokesman says they plan to push the amended measure through the House quickly. The White House said it opposes changes planned by the Democrats. It\u2019s a risky stalemate over a border crisis that has captured global attention amid unsettling reports of gruesome conditions at federal facilities and the deaths of migrants and children. The funding is urgently needed to prevent the humanitarian emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border from worsening. Money runs out in a matter of days. The reactions to this morning\u2019s Supreme Court rulings on partisan gerrymandering and a citizenship question on the US Census continue to pour in. On partisan gerrymandering \u201cChief Justice Roberts\u2019 ruling that no federal court can ever consider claims of extreme and unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering is truly appalling for the long term health of our democracy. It\u2019s a judicial green light for egregious partisanship, a permission slip for politicians to entrench themselves without fear of judicial intervention.\u201d \u2013 Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice \u201cThanks to the appointment of Justice Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court to replace Justice Kennedy, Trump\u2019s new conservative majority just made it impossible for federal courts to protect Americans from being disenfranchised by partisan gerrymandering. As Justice Kagan said, gerrymandering has \u2018debased and dishonored our democracy.\u2019\u201d \u2013 People for the American Way executive vice president Marge Baker \u201cAccording to the Court, if a question cannot be decided using legal doctrines and judicial tools, and instead involves essentially political, or even partisan, considerations, then it is not a question for federal judges. ... Although many believe that partisan gerrymandering undermines democratic processes and political accountability, the Court\u2019s majority was correct to stay its hand, to exercise restraint, and to call on elected officials and engaged citizens, rather than judges whose power is limited to deciding legal controversies, to address the issue.\u201d \u2013 Notre Dame Law School Professor Richard W Garnett On the Census question \u201c \u2018Contrived.\u2019 That\u2019s what the Supreme Court called the Administration\u2019s trumped up explanation for adding the citizenship question on the 2020 Census. In documents that Common Cause received in the North Carolina state challenge, Common Cause v. Lewis, emails and reports created by Thomas Hofeller, the chief Republican redistricting mapdrawer, reveal the real reasons for the citizenship question \u2013 to make redistricting \u2018advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites\u2019. Suspending the citizenship question is a step in the right direction.\u201d \u2013 Karen Hobert Flynn, Common Cause president \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision to block the Trump Administration\u2019s inclusion of a citizenship question on the U.S. Census is an important win for our country and our state, which has always been a beacon of hope and acceptance for immigrants. This decision will help ensure each and every New Yorker will be counted and provided with the critical services they need and deserve, regardless of their immigration status. Shame on the Trump Administration for its attempt to make the U.S. Census a political pawn in their continued anti-immigrant agenda. \u2013 New York governor Andrew Cuomo \u201cWe applaud the U.S. Supreme Court for stopping the citizenship question in its tracks. An addition of the Census question would have chilled minority participation in the 2020 Census and made it less accurate. The quality of the census has been protected today from the hasty addition of a politically-motivated question. It is of the utmost importance that the census reflect all communities living in the country.\u201d \u2013 Paul Smith, vice president at Campaign Legal Center \u201cIt should not be controversial to ask how many American citizens are in the United States of America. The only people who don\u2019t want to know are Democrats in Congress. Democrats went to work to influence the Supreme Court\u2019s consideration --cherry-picking facts to create misleading narratives, repeating baseless conspiracy theories, and manufacturing controversy.\u201d \u2013 Republican Representative Jim Jordan, ranking member of the House oversight committee The Dalai Lama has said Donald Trump lacks moral principle and that he is open to the next spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists being a woman, but only if she is \u201cattractive\u201d. In an interview with the BBC, the Dalai Lama also said that while he was a supporter of the EU and thought it would be better for the UK to remain part of it, he did not want to see Europe become \u201cMuslim\u201d or \u201cAfrican\u201d. Asked about the US president, whom the Tibetan spiritual leader has previously unflatteringly impersonated, he said: \u201cHis emotions [are] also a little bit,\u201d and made a gesture waggling his finger near his temple. \u201cOne day he says something, another day he says something. But I think [there is a] lack of moral principle. When he became president, he expressed America first. That is wrong. America, they should take the global responsibility.

The most recent content @realdonaldtrump might not violate the terms of service but it sure as heck violates the terms of taste, if you are into the whole constitutional democracy thing: Stepping away from the Supreme Court for a moment, the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington reports from the country\u2019s largest child detention center, in Homestead, Florida: Bernie Sanders is the latest Democratic presidential candidate to make a beeline for the children\u2019s detention center in Homestead, south of Miami. Having spoken at the first Democratic debate last night he has now had some pointed words to say about Trumps\u2019s treatment of migrant kids. He began on a favorite Sanders theme - berating big corporations for running private prisons. This center is run for some $1bn a year by Caliburn - a for-profit company upon whose board of advisers sits Trump\u2019s former chief of staff John Kelly. \u201cIn the United States you shouldn\u2019t have private corporations making money out of imprisoning children,\u201d Sanders said, engulfed in swarms of mosquitoes and even more pesky TV people. Sanders said in the first week of his presidency he would call a summit of leaders from Central America and Mexico to try to get to the root causes of the northward migration of thousands of families fleeing violence. \u201cI say to all Americans, if a gang member came up to you and threatened to kill your children, wouldn\u2019t you try and flee the country too?\u201d Sanders is one in a long line of Democratic candidates coming to this detention center to add their words of condemnation about what is happening to the up-to-3,000 children being detained here. Next up: Beto O\u2019Rourke. A few more reactions to this morning\u2019s Scotus action: And University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck notes how the shift from retired justice Anthony Kennedy to justice Brett Kavanaugh might have made the difference in the partisan gerrymandering case: The big question around the citizenship/census ruling: will the Trump administration have the time / organization to mount a new effort to put the question in place before 2020 Census season (and it\u2019s unclear just when the cutoff here is)?: More reactions: Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice, issued the following statement: On the census, the Trump administration\u2019s lies went so far that even this Supreme Court had to say no. If this leads to a result with no citizenship question, that would be a very welcome outcome, and it would also preserve the status quo. This should have been an easy case, and in the end, it was. But Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 ruling that no federal court can ever consider claims of extreme and unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering is truly appalling for the long term health of our democracy. It\u2019s a judicial green light for egregious partisanship, a permission slip for politicians to entrench themselves without fear of judicial intervention. On the Census ruling, NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman declared \u201ca victory for all New Yorkers\u201d: This is a victory for all New Yorkers who refuse to be undercounted, discriminated against, or driven into the shadows. The Trump administration must not be allowed to weaponize the census in its war on immigrants, people of color, and the poor. From the very beginning, the administration has hoped to add a citizenship question in order to undercount, marginalize, and limit the political power of immigrant communities. The justices saw through the Trump administration\u2019s absurd excuses for the addition of the question. We will do everything we can with our partners to ensure that all New Yorkers are counted.\u201d Negative reactions to the court\u2019s diffidence on partisan gerrymandering continue to come in: It\u2019s a \u201csetback in the fight for fair maps,\u201d said Paul Smith, vice president at the campaign legal center: Today\u2019s decision is a setback in the fight for fair maps around the country. While we are disappointed that North Carolina voters will continue to vote in districts that were shown at trial to be severely biased, the fight is far from over. We must redouble our efforts outside the courtroom to keep advancing efforts that put the voices of voters first. Independent citizen-led commissions, such as those passed in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, and Utah in 2018, have been highly successful in ensuring that district maps fairly represent the population. Reformers from other states should follow this lead and continue to fight back against gerrymandering.\u201d In a statement, Alex Keena, a Virginia Commonwealth University political science professor and co-author of \u201cGerrymandering in America,\u201d calls the decision perhaps \u201cone of the most consequential court decisions in 21st century American politics\u201d: This decision may be one of the most consequential court decisions in 21st century American politics because it forecloses the possibility that citizens can challenge unfair districting maps in the federal courts on the grounds that they favor one party over another. It also means that political parties are free to manipulate legislative districting to advance nakedly political ends, and it further intensifies the battle for control over state government in the run up to redistricting in 2021. The irony in the decision is that the Court applied the \u201cpolitical question doctrine\u201d that was established in Baker v. Carr, which was the case that originally gave citizens a tool for challenging gerrymandering in the 1960s.\u201d The Trump administration will not be able to move ahead with its original plan to include a question about citizenship on the 2020 US census, after the supreme court on Thursday upheld a lower court decision rejecting the commerce department\u2019s stated justification for doing so. But the commerce department might have time to advance alternative reasoning for including the citizenship question on the census, resulting in its inclusion, analysts said. More details soon ... Important caveat on the census ruling: it might leave the Trump administration a window to get the citizenship question on the census after all, Eric Citron at Scotusblog writes: Here\u2019s how I would characterize the bottom line on the census: The Court has rejected the proposition that it is impossible for Commerce to add a citizenship question, but it has also held that it does not believe the voting-rights related justification that Commerce offered. That means Commerce could get another chance to justify its decision. Whether it has the time to do that is a practical question, not a legal one. The Supreme Court has issued a second major ruling, on the question of whether the Trump administration can include a question about US citizenship on the 2020 Census. It appears that the court has agreed with a lower court which ruled that the commerce department could have reasonable grounds for including the question but was skeptical of the Trump administrations claim that it was just looking for better data to enforce the Voting Rights Act. Looks like a defeat for team Trump. But stay tuned... The advocacy group Common Cause has blasted the Supreme Court ruling in a statement from President Karen Hobert Flynn: \u201cToday, five Supreme Court Justices turned their backs on hundreds of thousands of people in Maryland and North Carolina stripped of their voice in Washington by power-hungry politicians. The Supreme Court had the opportunity to end partisan gerrymandering once and for all but instead a narrow majority chose to wash their hands of the undemocratic practice. \u201cWithout recourse to the Supreme Court, the American people must continue to take the battle to the state courts, to the polls, and to the streets, to make their voices heard and to end partisan gerrymandering once and for all.\u201d \u201cThis decision is part of a disturbing pattern from the Roberts Court of undercutting or eviscerating reforms passed by Congress to protect the integrity of our democracy. This Supreme Court has gutted the landmark Voting Rights Act, shredded campaign finance limits in Citizens United, and now it has condoned extreme partisan gerrymandering.\u201d How will partisan gerrymandering cases be weighed in the future? Assuming that lower federal courts hew to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling this morning and stay away from partisan gerrymandering cases, plaintiffs would still have recourse through state courts. But as Kagan points out in her dissent, state court benches (like federal courts) can include political appointees, or judges elected on gerrymandered maps that warranted a challenge in the first place \u2013 potentially undermining faith in the judges\u2019 ability to rule fairly on partisan claims. Justice Kagan is reading her dissent in the partisan gerrymandering case from the bench, according to reporters in and out of the room. Reading a dissent from the bench is SCOTUS-speak for \u201cthe majority royally messed this one up.\u201d Pro-democracy activists warned that the Supreme Court ruling opened the way for more aggressive gerrymandering. \u201cLetting politicians manipulate voting maps is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse,\u201d the advocacy group Common Cause said in a statement. \u201cWhether they favor Democrats or Republicans, gerrymanders cheat voters.\u201d State-level courts would still be able to hear partisan gerrymandering cases, but the supreme court\u2019s demurral meant that no federal standard to block the practice was likely soon. Powerful words from Kagan\u2019s dissent: In a bit of snap analysis over at ScotusBlog, Eric Citron says that the partisan gerrymandering ruling is every bit as far-reaching as voting rights advocates feared. The troublesome concern here is that should, for example, a Republican-led legislature in North Carolina or elsewhere redraw district lines in a way that disenfranchises Democrats, there would be no way to appeal that action beyond the circuit court level (and it seems that the supreme court in this case is saying that not even circuit courts should look at partisan gerrymandering cases): The holding here is that such claims are non-justiciable -- that they are not of the kind that courts can decide. That admits of very few factual exceptions, if any. Essentially, if your claim sounds in partisan gerrymandering, the courts cannot accept it. In his majority opinion, chief justice John Roberts rebuts Kagan\u2019s claim that the decision of the court to try to stay out of partisan gerrymandering cases represents a failure of duty. \u201cNo one can accuse this Court of having a crabbed view of the reach of its competence,\u201d Roberts writes. \u201cBut we have no commission to allocate political power and influence in the absence of a constitutional directive or legal standards to guide us in the exercise of such authority.\u201d The partisan gerrymandering ruling, which takes in two cases before the court last term, splits 5-4 along ideological lines, with justices Kagan, Ginsburg, Breyer and Sotomayor dissenting. Kagan\u2019s dissent sharply criticizes the court\u2019s diffidence: For the first time ever, this Court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities. The court has demurred in the partisan gerrymandering cases, meaning that plaintiffs bringing future claims of partisan gerrymandering, by which political party insiders manipulate district lines for partisan advantage, could have limited recourse and be unable to appeal to the high court. From the opinion just released: Partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts. We have our first opinion of the day from the supreme court, which has ruled that the state of Wisconsin was within the law in drawing blood from an unconscious driver without a search warrant. It\u2019s a 5-4 ruling not quite along ideological lines, with justice Neil Gorsuch joining the minority. But Gorsuch\u2019s dissent is based on the fact that he would have dismissed the case, which the high court should not have heard he says. We expect some action out of the Supreme Court in a half hour or so. We\u2019ve speculated about who \u201cwon\u201d the first Democratic presidential debate. But have you reflected on what the dumbest moment of the night was? The advocacy group Media Matters nominates moderator / NBC News host Chuck Todd\u2019s lightning round. Todd said: \u201cI want to go down the line here, finish up foreign policy,\u201d NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd said toward the end of the first Democratic presidential primary debate of the 2020 election cycle Wednesday night. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple question: What is our -- what is the biggest threat to -- who is the geopolitical threat to the United States? Just give me a one-word answer.\u201d Click through for video of the moment: Do you think a clear winner emerged from last night\u2019s Democratic debate? We can at least confer awards on the candidates who talked the most, and they would be Cory Booker, the New Jersey senator; Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former congressman; and Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts. On a crowded stage, Booker spoke for a total of 10.9 minutes to Warren\u2019s 9.3, according to a Washington Post analysis. Speaking least was Washington governor Jay Inslee with an even five minutes. As for who \u201cwon,\u201d the Iowa Starting Line politics site has an interesting roundup of reactions from Iowans, who will be first to vote in next year\u2019s primary season. The Iowans found something to like about many of the candidates. Here\u2019s one reaction in favor of Booker and Warren: Melissa Hale, 55, Bondurant Hale came into the night looking forward to hearing from Booker and Warren and left thinking both were impressive. She also mentioned that there was a bit too much bickering and fighting on stage for her. \u201cWarren and Booker are strong because they\u2019re concise and precise, and they know what they\u2019re talking about. I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re showboating, it seems like it\u2019s coming from the heart,\u201d Hale said. \u201cGoing in, I had about ten [candidates] I like, but Booker is probably my top one.\u201d Read further over at Iowa Starting Line.

And if you\u2019re looking for reviews of the first Democratic debate last night, you can read our roundup coverage here: In about an hour, the supreme court is expected to issue rulings in multiple cases with significant implications for the functioning of American democracy. Today is the last day for the court to issue rulings for the past term\u2019s cases, and so anticipation is running high. In one set of cases, the court is expected to rule on whether partisan gerrymandering is constitutional \u2013 or, alternatively, the court might sidestep the cases, in a move that could prevent future appeals of gerrymandering cases to the high court. The court is also expected to rule on whether the inclusion of a question about citizenship in the 2020 US census would be lawful. Republicans have been pushing for the inclusion of the question as part of a multi-stage strategy to suppress voting among Democratic-leaning populations and to alter the way congressional districts are drawn. \u201cThe justices are set to take the bench at 10am EDT, with five cases in all still unresolved,\u201d the AP reports: Congressional redistricting is at issue in two cases, from Maryland and North Carolina. The others include control of a large portion of eastern Oklahoma that once belonged to Indian tribes and the rights of unconscious, suspected drunken drivers. [Chief Justice John] Roberts is the only justice who has yet to write an opinion in cases argued in March and April, when the court heard the redistricting and census cases, respectively. Justices customarily write at least one opinion every month that cases are argued. In addition, the chief justice often, but not always, takes on the burden of deciding the most difficult issues facing the court. That he also is the justice closest to the center of the court only magnifies Roberts\u2019 role in the outcome of cases with the potential to alter political power across the United States.
