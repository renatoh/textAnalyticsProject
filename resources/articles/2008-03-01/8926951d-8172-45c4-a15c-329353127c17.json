I'll be here from 7-9, covering all the action on BBC2 until, after four days of canine competition, one dog shall rule over them all. Join me - or don't, that's also fine - with your predictions, comments and pithy observations. Live blogs, for those unfamiliar with the notion or point, are something we do quite often on the media site, and are, basically, a light-hearted way of covering an interesting or notable televised event. Or not that interesting. Or, in fact, notable. But in this case it is both. So if you happen to be online, you can hit refresh to update and for new comments if there are any, which there probably won't be, because it's Sunday night. And it's Crufts. And if you're catching up with things you might have missed over the weekend, welcome. 7pm: To the strains of the Final Countdown by Europe, the camera swings around an overexcited crowd at NEC Arena. Ladies and Gentlemen, it's Crufts: Best In Show. 7.05: After a breathy introduction which saw Ben Fogle cuddling last years Best In Show winner, Something Something Fabulous Willy, whose fabulous name has surely provided the headline writers of Dog World with a boundless amount of fun in the last year, and Clare Balding looking tired as they wished the best of luck to someone out there in tellyland who was trying to hold off delivering her baby until the end of the show, we're plunged into the Agility finals. Dogs run through tunnels, over see-saws and around poles. Fast. Sometimes they run through them the wrong way, and get disqualified, but carry on running because, at the end of the day, they're dogs, and having a reasonable amount of fun, and are left to do just that. 7.15: As we wait for the actual judging of things to start, we watch as Ben Fogle wanders around the halls enthusing about things wildly. Ben, he reveals, met his wife while they were both out walking their dogs in a park, which will be a great disappointment to his great many female admirers out there, though it is a nice story, if true. 7.18: We get to see a profile of a particular kind of dog - the Bedlington Terrier, which has a head like a large sponge, no hair on the back, big fluffy legs, and is, over all, quite unattractive. If, in fact, you were ever attracted to dogs in the first place, which is possibly not something we want to get into here if so 7.25: While waiting for the Best of Group judging for the Terriers, we get to see some of the breed rounds from earlier today. Brilliantly, every single dog that the camera crew and presenter decide to talk to and follow manages to get knocked out immediately, none of them being awarded anything at all. We do, however, get to see the brick-headed Bedlingtons again, which Clare admits to being terribly partial to. \"They're really fluffy and bouncy!\" she says, technically. After a quick chat to Peter Purves, we cut to the Best in Group finals, already in progress. The Judge is putting them on the table, patting them down - for concealed weapons, we presume - and lifting their tail, which is something that has worked out badly for me in the past. Don't try it. It's like a pump handle on some of them. No kidding. 7.32: One of the dogs, a brown and white one, since you ask, was just described excitedly as a 'Real pet dog! He lives at home!' which just makes me feel a little sad, really. Where do the rest of them live? The terriers are happily - or at least placidly - trotting around the green carpet for the bow-tied judge. We're about to find out which will take the terrier group. It's a terrier! No, it's a soft-coated wheaten, which has a shaggy coat and a heavy fringe and I don't fancy it much, to be honest. But then, I'm rooting for the Chihuahua. Mainly because it was one of the only judging sessions I was able to attend in person, so I feel like I have a personal connection with the little tyke, but partly because I do so enjoy watching an enormous man run around the ring with a rodent-sized pet on a string. Accroding to Mike in the comments, whose partner has been lost to the dogs for the last several days, the winner of the Gundog group was apparently 'a travesty' - and he has a point, it's one of those mop things that looks like they're on wheels. 7.44: As my blogging software creaks under the strain of such excitement, we get an extended profile of the Best In Show judge Clare Coxall, and if you do have the time, I recommend you reading the Dog World profile of the lady herself here - unless you have already, of course, as I believe it's the most exhaustive newspaper biography I have ever, ever had the pleasure to read. There is a rumour, says Clare Balding, that the grand old judge will be spraying her hair gold for the occasion. Oh please say that's true. Please. We get to see a lot of Clare Coxall and her big fluffy poodles. How nice. 7.50: Soon, the Hound group will be judged, but first we get to talk about how the hounds have been doing over the day. Well, they've mainly been quite big, and on the whole, fluffy. We get an indepth look at the afghan hounds of Liverpool, which are quite the epitome of big and fluffy, and which, apparently, enjoy racing. 7.54pm: In one of the most instructive moments of the coverage so far, we see an afghan being washed and dried. Washing takes place in a large bath, obviously, where as drying is done in a blow-drying cupboard with a perspex front. The front is opened, the dog placed in the cupboard, the door closed and hot air pumped in. The dog sits sedately, its hair flying out to all sides. It's one of the best things I've ever seen. I'm not trying to imagine doing that with a cat. 7.59: After a long conversation with a boring breeder (a dog-breeder, rather than slang name for a hetrosexual, although possibly that as well, I'm in no position to comment, I'm unfamiliar with the nice lady and don't want to conjecture) we see all the Best of Breed Hound Group, trotting around a ring to the sound of The Beach Boys who may well be, apparently, big Hound fans. We go straight to the Best of Group judging, where the judge is checking out a basenji, who is, according to the voiceover 'the most catlike of all breeds'. I'm looking quite carefully, and he still looks like a dog to me. Quite a lot like a dog, in fact. I think he just said 'woof'. 8.05: \"Three words you should always remember about the dachshund: Long, Low and Level\". Like Holland, perhaps. Now don't say you haven't learnt something here tonight. 8.09: The Norwegian Elkhound, we are informed by the voiceover is a 'marvellously relaxed dog, as you can tell', and if relaxed means standing about looking doglike then yes, I suppose he clearly is. He has, apparently, a web-shaped head. This is crazy-talk. head like a web? No! Head like a dogs head. The Norwegian Elkhound comes third, behind a beagle, and a miniature something else. The winning of the beagle, however, means that there are, we are told, seven breeds up for Best In Show that have never, EVER - not a one of them, not a single one - taken BiS before. Ladies and Gentlemen, you're witnessing a true historical event tonight. Who SAID this didn't belong on News blog? I can't think of anything more newsworthy, frankly. Well, not more than ten or twenty things, anyway. 8.16: After a quick recap of the nominees, we find out who has won the public 'Friend For Life' vote. What is the Friend For Life vote? I'm so glad you asked. It's a vote for nice dogs who have, in some way, changed the lives of their owners. It is won by a tearful girl with Cerebral Palsy and her dog, who is brown. Yeppa or something. That's the dog, not the girl. The girl, unbelievably sweet and in a wheelchair, cries and thanks her granddad. \"If you're not sitting at home with a tear running down your face, you're made of stone\" Oh dear. Call me Cliff. Or Pebbles. I'm dry, here. 8.24: The other presenters who isn't Ben or Clare is talking to some of the handlers backstage. \"How are you feeling?\" he asks one, and then forgets to hold the microphone over toward him, so we never get to find out, just here IdiotBoy saying 'Yes. Mhm' before clearly being shouted at by the producer and told to move on. What do the winners win, and do they get to keep the trophy, asks a reader email. Clare says \u00a3100 and no. Which might sound a bit tight, but then if you imagine how much it would cost to have sex with it after that, that's where the money comes from. For your dog to have sex with it, I mean. I mean, their bloodline becomes very precious because they're a champion, and they stud price goes up exponentially. Probably. YES! It's Mary Ray and her Heelwork to Music routine! Everyone - an awed hush please. It's dancing dogs. 8.29: My cats, who have been paying bugger-all notice to this so far, have lined up in front of the television, one of them stretching up and batting at the performing pooch with her paws. You've emasculated the dog, Mary. Not even the feline world is afraid anymore. 8.32: Dogs dance with Mary, dressed up as a ringleader, and her assistant, who's dressed up a clown. Her assistant, interestingly was Richard Curtis. \"Not that one\", apparently. No, this one I saw in the heelwork to music freestyle finals the other day. He was dancing to the A Team theme with a Portuguese water hound and a gun. The dog lost concentration, they both marched off halfway through the 'Bah-bah-ba-BAH!' section, and all you heard was a single shot and some whining fading into silence. No, not really. That last bit's not true. The rest is though. Oh goodness, it's arrived. After a couple of confused attempts to pass over to the BBC booth in the arena, we're there. It's about to start. The final round. The big one. I'm still rooting for the Chihuahua. Come on. 8.37: We finally cut to the arena, there are seven spotlights, filled with seven trumpets, playing a fanfare in preparation to the dogs. The hall is packed, and judge Clare Coxall - apparently one of the most dramatic judges on the circuit, so lets brace ourselves for a whole bunch of excitement and some showy pointing - comes onto the stage wearing some kind of cross between a cardigan and an antimacasser. 8.40: The dogs are brought into the arena to rounds of rapturous applause - the Shiba Inu, winner of the utility group, the pointless and cute little chihuahua, the american cocker spaniel, giant schnauzer, the 'Samoyed', which sounds like a sword or a hat, but is in fact a do, and winner of the Pastoral group. And then the other two that we've already seen win this evening. 20.50: Each dog is poked and prodded and then sent to run around in a circle. As each dog moves, the crowd goes absolutely wild. The dog runs! Watch the dog run! Run, dog, run! (clap clap clap clap clap) That's the real skill of dog handling, of course. If it's a little dog, like the chihuahua, for example, you must walk slowly around the ring so his tiny little wind-up legs have a chance to keep up. But if you are showing a large hound, you must run very fast. Which in a neat little skirt suit always looks a bit funny. 8.55: After watching them run, and then moving the dogs (it's a technical term, I'm quite the expert by now, you know) a second time, Clare Coxall chooses ... wait for it... THE GIANT SCHNAUZER! An enormous schnauzer, Ch Jafrak Philippe Olivier to give him his full name, has won Best In Show. The Samoyed comes second, I think. But no one cares who is 'almost best in show but not quite'. It's all about the Schnauzer, which is not only a nice dog, it's also pleasant to say. Schnauzer. (bless you!) 8.58: So there we have it. It's all over for another year. Why did you choose the Schnauzer, Clare the presenter asks Clare the Judge. \"It came through the ARCH! And he just Moves straight ahead, All the way forward, like this, and I thought yes and he looked like he OWNED the place and of course the Samoyed did too but Oh, when I put my hands on him and he's got muscles upon muscles and the biggest roundest blackest eyes I've seen and...\" And we all realise why dog judges are mainly restricted to pointing. 9.00 And that's the end. Thank you all for your comments, thank you for reading - well done to the bonny black dog with the droopy moustache and the big black eyes; we can only imagine how much a eggcup of his manliness would cost you now. Quite a lot, though. Thank you, and good night. And woof."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
