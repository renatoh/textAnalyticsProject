Gilchrist, who scored centuries in each of the previous Tests, cracked 10 boundaries on his way to an unbeaten 60, his half-century coming off only 47 balls, and once again turned the Tasman tide. When play ended early after an hour under floodlights, New Zealand were in some trouble. Glenn McGrath had removed Craig Cumming and James Marshall to reduce the home side to nine for two. \"I can understand why the New Zealand team are feeling disappointed and frustrated at that,\" Gilchrist said afterwards. \"It is difficult batting in artificial light with a red ball but it's a horrible task for umpires to make a judgment.\" New Zealand enjoyed an encouraging early success when James Marshall ran out Michael Clarke with a direct hit. But the nightwatchman Jason Gillespie continued to frustrate them and the Black Caps added no more wickets in the morning session. Gillespie's innings was finally ended after 145 balls and 35 runs when he wafted a Chris Martin delivery to the wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum. James Franklin took the final four wickets to finish with career-best figures of six for 119, but Gilchrist, his rhythm and timing unaffected by rain delays, remained unbeaten. \"They're the greatest team in the world at the moment,\" Franklin said. \"Every wicket you've got to work bloody hard for.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
