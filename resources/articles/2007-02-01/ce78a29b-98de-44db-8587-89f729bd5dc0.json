The strategy aims to address the key challenges identified in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Stern review of the economic impact of climate change. Nerc is focusing on funding science that will enable a more precise prediction of the effects of climate change on the environment. It says research is needed to be able to predict the impacts of climate change over a shorter timescale than scientists are currently able to do. This will allow policymakers to design strategies to mitigate and adapt to the effects of global warming. \"One of the main outcomes of the science we will be funding is to be able to give foresight about what will be happening in the future. Our goal is to look at the effects of climate change on the environment and to be in a position to predict what will happen, say a few tens of years ahead, and also on a local and regional scale,\" says Alan Thorpe, Nerc's chief executive. One gap in climate-change science, identified in the Stern review, is the ability to predict \"high-impact but low probability\" events, such as the likelihood that the global temperature will rise by the maximum estimate of six degrees by the end of the century. The strategy identifies seven themes, including the climate system, biodiversity, and pollution and human health. Nerc will fund research into improving climate models in order to map the frequency and intensity of extreme events, and into understanding how the loss of biodiversity affects human wellbeing, and how pollutants and pathogens move through the environment. The council will also launch two new multidisciplinary research initiatives. It will work with a number of partners, including Defra, to address the science needs of businesses, policymakers and society, and team up with the Department for International Development and the Economic and Social Research Council to fund research into the sustainable use of natural resources. Nerc will look at what skills environmental scientists need today and in the future, and how this tallies with the research fellows, PhD and masters students it currently funds. The council is working to improve its knowledge transfer activities, including the use of its science in policymaking and the commercialisation of research, by actively encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship among its scientists. The consultation closes on April 16, and Nerc hopes to publish the final strategy by the end of 2007. \u00b7 Natasha Gilbert is news editor of Research Fortnight, ng@researchresearch.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
