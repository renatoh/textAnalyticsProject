Leaked information from within Helloworld showed earlier this year that the company had not charged Cormann and his family for international flights worth $2,780.82 in 2017, not long before it won a $1bn contract with the finance minister\u2019s department. The Nine newspapers reported on Friday that two former Helloworld staff were now under investigation by Victoria police, and were visited on Wednesday for questioning. Victoria police confirmed in a statement that its fraud and extortion squad was \u201ccurrently investigating allegations an employee accessed unauthorised data from a private company\u201d. \u201cAs the investigation is ongoing, we are not in a position to comment further on the matter,\u201d a police spokesman said. Cormann has denied any suggestion that he lodged a complaint with Victoria police. \u201cIt certainly hasn\u2019t got anything to do with me, I wasn\u2019t involved in any complaints, I mean I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he told Sky News on Friday morning. The finance minister said he had only found out about the investigation in media reports. \u201cThis is state police in Victoria, a Labor jurisdiction, I don\u2019t think anyone can credibly suggest that anything there is happening at my behest,\u201d he said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cI suspect that state police in Victoria, like police everywhere, act independently.\u201d Cormann also denied any suggestion he had received free travel from Helloworld. He sought to characterise it as an invoice that was simply not processed correctly. \u201cI booked travel, I supplied my credit card expecting obviously that the payment would be processed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it wasn\u2019t processed, what I would have expected staff to do that became aware of that would be to either process the payment with the credit card details that were provided for that purpose or if there was any outstanding invoice and credit card payment couldn\u2019t be processed, to chase me for it.\u201d Cormann booked the travel directly through the chief executive of the company, Andrew Burnes. Burnes was then the Liberal party\u2019s federal treasurer. Asked on Friday why he had booked the flights directly through Burnes, Cormann initially said it was for privacy reasons and to avoid him having to walk into a travel agency. He couldn\u2019t explain why he didn\u2019t simply book the flights online. \u201cI could have, that\u2019s right, I could have, that\u2019s quite right,\u201d he told Sky News. Cormann said he didn\u2019t know why the fraud and extortion squad was investigating the matter. He said he had forgotten about the story. Cormann has since paid the invoice. The police investigation comes just months after the federal government enacted strong new corporate whistleblowing laws that extend protections to former company employees who speak out about misconduct. Those laws give corporate whistleblowers protection in some circumstances for speaking out publicly, and create civil penalties for anyone who causes or threatens detriment to those who blow the whistle. \u201cIt broadens the scope of who a whistleblower is, and so now it includes not just employees but former employees, contractors, volunteers, and even the spouses of employees,\u201d the Transparency International Australia chief executive, Serena Lillywhite, said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite transformative really because it significantly broadens the scope of who can be deemed a whistleblower and \u2026 there is no longer a requirement that a whistleblower must first go internally to blow the whistle.\u201d The laws also require large companies to have a plan and policy or dealing with whistleblower complaints. Those plans must be in place by January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
