Supreme Commander (PC) and Excite Truck (Wii) are worth a look if you fancy splashing some cash on a new release - Fusion Frenzy 2 is barely worth a mention, let alone 30 quid - but Okami is still the most interesting game of February. Me? I'm planning to spend some time with Crackdown (360) - the GTA style game that looks a whole lot better than I originally thought. And it has a decent co-op - hurrah. What are you planning to play this weekend?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
