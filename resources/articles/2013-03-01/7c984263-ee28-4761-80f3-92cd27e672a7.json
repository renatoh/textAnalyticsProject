Its story of loss, love, guilt, awakening and redemption \u2013 while artfully shot, tightly written and well-acted \u2013 ultimately served as a vehicle for a handful of familiar and uncomfortable facts about a disease that it is well within our power to eradicate. Facts such as these: that despite malaria being both curable and preventable, we allow it to claim more than half a million lives a year; that we routinely spend the cost of a life-saving mosquito net on three paper cups of coffee; that the number of lives Britain and the US have lost in military action since the last world war is minuscule in comparison to the deaths permitted by our inaction; that, as we all well know, we do far less than we could. Mary and Martha themselves, a pair of mothers from different sides of the Atlantic, learn the power of such facts firsthand. Hilary Swank's wealthy and willful Mary hauls her young son out of school in the US and halfway across the world to teach him at an idyllic country getaway in South Africa, only to lose him to malaria on a visit to Mozambique, while Martha, a British mother played with a bashful warmth by Brenda Blethyn, loses her own son to the disease when he visits Mozambique to volunteer as a teacher. After a chance meeting, the pair strike up a friendship, united by their need to answer the question: what should we do now? Martha volunteers at an orphanage, while Mary heads home to seek audiences with politicians and civil servants in a bid to make her country do more. Eventually, Martha, too, heads to the US, where the pair \u2013 somewhat implausibly \u2013 make an impassioned plea at a Senate meeting to find the money to stop malaria now. At which point, it would be fair to say, the plot stretches credulity. An accusation to which Curtis, cast, crew and all those affected by the disease would, I suspect, respond: no more so than our inaction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
