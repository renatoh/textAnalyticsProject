What an exasperating film. Each of the half-dozen or so thinkers gets around 20 minutes to maunder on - simultaneously not long enough and far too long. Frustratingly, no subject is investigated in depth, and the glibness is dull. Cornel West comes across like an insufferably conceited name-dropper as he holds forth in the back of a car that the director is driving around New York. At one point, he airily implies that the teeming masses on the sidewalks around him are an unthinking mob. None of the speakers is interested in, or equal to, the challenge of discussing the concerns of philosophy without referencing other philosophers. Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, usually such a great turn, gives a feebly equivocal riff on ecology, which I fear will only give ammunition to the climate-change rubbishers. Disappointment is something the critic must endure philosophically."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
