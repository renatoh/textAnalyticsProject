So that might be a good time to wrap up, so we can tackle another huge day on Monday. Here\u2019s our front-page story about today\u2019s drama: Read it all here: Thank you, as ever, for reading and commenting. It\u2019s been a wild weekend. See you shortly. GW All over Athens people have been queuing tonight, but the lines outside the National Bank branches were by some distance the longest, reports Jon Henley. And that\u2019s because the National Bank supplies the banknotes, and lots of other Greek banks, by midnight on Sunday, had no more of those. \u201cPeople are feeling very concerned \u2026 very insecure,\u201d said Maria Poulimeniou, outside the National Bank on Eleftherios Venizelos street in Kallithea, a southern Athens suburb. \u201cThe situation changes from one minute to the next. First they say the banks will be closed on Monday, now for the whole week.\u201d Pouleminou, who works in the finance department of a shipping company, said she had tried the local branch of her bank, Alpha, but \u201cthey had nothing left. Empty. So I\u2019m here. I\u2019m taking out the limit \u2013 \u20ac600, it is here. But they say after midnight it will be \u20ac60. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a queue.\u201d While Greece\u2019s government announced on Sunday night that the country\u2019s banks would not open on Monday, that capital controls would be introduced and limits set on withdrawals, there was no official confirmation yet of what those limits would be. But there were at least 70 people queuing outside this one branch, and most National Bank branches on the way back into town had similar lines. As their debt-laden, all but insolvent country \u2013 and the eurozone \u2013 entered uncharted territory last night, it seemed plenty of Greeks were taking no chances.\u201cI\u2019m not taking out all I have,\u201d said Stathis, 58, who described himself as a private sector employee. \u201cBut the government has just said the banks will stay shut for a week, so I\u2019m here to take out what I need for that \u2013 maybe a couple of hundred euros.\u201d He was quite clear about who he though was responsible. \u201cWe should never even have tried to negotiate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever the government did, I think we would probably have ended up exactly where we are right now. This whole thing has been planned, from the start, by the Germans.\u201d Yannis, a postgraduate finance student, was more phlegmatic. \u201cI just want to withdraw what I can now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s far from clear to me when we will be able to take money out again. I\u2019m aiming for \u20ac300 \u2013 enough for at least a week, I hope.\u201d But he said he had \u201cno idea\u201d what would happen after that. \u201c(Prime minister Alexis) Tsipras says he\u2019ll be able to go back to Brussels in a better position after this referendum, and reopen negotiations with the institutions from a position of strength...But nobody knows if that will be the case. Nobody knows anything, in fact.\u201d Anna, 63, a pensioner, wanted to make clear she was not standing in a bank queue just before midnight because she had panicked. \u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no cash, and I obviously need some. My pension has just been paid, and I\u2019m here with my neighbout to take some of it out. Not all of it \u2013 just some. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m not scared, not in the least. We\u2019ve seen worse, here. We will come through this.\u201d The Big, Big question isn\u2019t whether shareholders lose money. It is whether investors are still confident that debt issued by Italy, Spain, Portugal, et al is safe. Three years ago, Mario Draghi calmed the crisis by vowing to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to save the euro. We are about to find out if people believe him. Sam Tuck, a senior currency strategist at ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd, has told Bloomberg that we\u2019re entering a \u201cvery very volatile\u201d time. \u201cThe knee-jerk reaction is for flight out of the euro and into safety. Defaulting to the IMF tomorrow looks like a certainty and when that happens there is no proposal, there is no legal mandate for Europe to bail out Greece. There are a whole bunch of unknown unknowns.\u201d Analysts at RBC Capital Markets confirm that traders will be racing for safety on Monday, and watching Greece very, very closely. Here\u2019s their early take: In the early hours of Saturday, the PM announced plans for a referendum. Events have accelerated since then. The euro is trading significantly weaker at the Asia open (spot 1.0970) and risk aversion seems likely to dominate the day ahead As the week progresses, if polls point to a Yes vote and more clarity emerges regarding what happens after the programme expires on Tuesday, that initial market reaction may soften. The day ahead is quiet for scheduled data leaving focus squarely on Greece. Remember, when stock market traders switched off their machines on Friday night, there was broad confidence that Saturday\u2019s eurogroup meeting might bring a Greek deal closer. Instead, Alexis Tsipras announced his shock referendum plan as Europeans headed to bed - leaving investors watching the crisis unfold, but unable to reach. Until now. Oh Goodness Me. Global stock markets are just getting into gear for the new week, and it\u2019s already clear that shares are going to fall sharply on Monday morning. The future\u2019s market is predicting that the main US stock markets could fall by close to 2%. European indices are also going to be hit very hard, judging by IG\u2019s futures market: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has written about how Greece\u2019s crisis could be even more serious than some people recognise. He\u2019s dubbing it a \u201cSarajevo moment\u201d for the eurozone - whose full consequences aren\u2019t quite apparent yet, but which are truly seismic. Here\u2019s a flavour: A fully fledged monetary union has the means to transfer resources from one region to another. This is what happens in the US or the UK, for example, with higher taxes in areas that are doing well being redistributed to areas with slower growth and higher unemployment. The euro, however, was constructed along different lines. Countries were allowed to join even though it was clear they would struggle to compete with the better performing nations such as Germany. A stability and growth pact designed to ensure a common set of budget controls was a poor substitute for fiscal union. From the start, it was obvious that the only mechanism for a country that ran into severe difficulties would be harsh austerity. Greece is the result of what happens when politics is allowed to override economics. If Greece leaves, the idea that the euro is irrevocable is broken. Any government that runs into difficulties in the future will have the Greek option of devaluation as an alternative to endless austerity. Just as importantly, the financial markets will know that, and will pile pressure on countries that look vulnerable. That\u2019s why Greece represents an existential crisis for the eurozone. It will be said in response that Greece is a small, insignificant country and that the single currency has much better defences than it had at the last moment of acute trouble in the summer of 2012. Diplomats in Europe\u2019s capitals took very much the same view in late June 1914. The euro is continuing to be pummelled in early trading in Asia -- it has now shed almost two cents against the US dollar. Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway sums it up: Alastair Winter, chief economist at City firm Daniel Stewart, fears Greece is now certain to leave the eurozone. He believes that Greece\u2019s creditors have been angling to trigger the formation of a government of national unity, which would accept the measures they proposed. But even if that happened, other European parliaments might not back such a deal (the Bundestag could be particularly unreceptive). Winter adds that other eurozone governments could come under threat too: In the meantime, the Greek government is likely to run out of money to pay pensions and public sector salaries: it has already stopped paying suppliers, many of which are going bust, and businesses and individual taxpayers are withholding their dues. In other words, Grexit is inevitable even if the timing and mechanics are far from clear and it appears that the EuroGroup et al are decreasingly uncomfortable with that outcome. How long, however, before the domino theories of other exits start to circulate? Here\u2019s the moment that Greece officially entered the era of capital controls tonight, as Alexis Tsipras addressed the nation. Helpfully there are English subtitles too. Macedonia, the Balkan state to the north of Greece, has instructed its banks to take action to protect themselves from the Greek crisis. The central bank of Macedonia has told commercial banks to \u201cwithdraw all deposits and loans from banks situated in Greece and their branches around the world.\u201d It also asked them to take \u201cpreventative measures\u201d to limit the flow of capital to Greece. It said the move was \u2018temporary\u201d, and designed to protect the Macedonian system from disruption. More here on Reuters. The rumour mill keeps turning tonight -- the Kathimerini newspaper says that the Athens stock market may also stay closed until the referendum has been held. Eurozone leaders and finance ministers have been insistent recently that the world economy is better placed than in 2012 to handle the Greek debt crisis. And it\u2019s true that the ECB does have much more tools to hand -- including the ability to buy up unlimited quantities of government bonds if a country risks loses market access (through Mario Draghi\u2019s OMT programme). But the potential implications of a Greek default and disorderly exit from the single currency are still serious. The Greek governments\u2019 total debt pile is around \u20ac320bn. Plus, there is commercial bank lending to consider. As our data editor Alberto Nardelli explains, eurozone banks have put their toes back into the Greek water as the crisis eased: German banks\u2019 claims on Greece, which dropped to \u20ac3.9bn at the end of 2012 after having peaked at above \u20ac30bn just two years earlier, were back to \u20ac10.6bn at the end of last year. Although at a reduced scale, Dutch and Italian banks have also seen their exposure increase over the same time period. The aggregate claims of French banks remain relatively low, compared with an exposure that was higher than \u20ac50bn five years ago. The closure of banks for a week, and the imposition of tough ATM limits, is particularly tough on those with little spare cash to hand: Tomorrow\u2019s front pages are coming in, and Greece gets top spot in the FT (again...) The White House has confirmed that Barack Obama weighed in on the eurozone crisis today, in a call with Angela Merkel: AFP has the details: US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday agreed that Greece needed to find its way back to a path of reform without exiting the eurozone, the White House said. In a telephone call about the unfolding crisis, Obama and Merkel \u201cagreed that it was critically important to make every effort to return to a path that will allow Greece to resume reforms and growth within the eurozone,\u201d the White House said. Obama and Merkel said their teams of economic advisors were closely monitoring the rapidly changing situation, the statement said. Here\u2019s another queue for ATM machine in central Athens: Greeks continue to flock to cash machines tonight, in response to tonight\u2019s announcement of capital controls. Reuters is reporting tonight that Greece\u2019s financial stability council recommended that ATMs should be closed on Monday, and that the \u20ac60 limit would then kick in on Tuesday. That\u2019s according to a source. I cannot find an official announcement detailing the capital controls, I\u2019m afraid. And a recommendation isn\u2019t necessarily enacted. Here\u2019s the snaps: * 28-Jun-2015 20:49:00 - GREEK FINANCIAL STABILITY COUNCIL RECOMMENDED DAILY CASH WITHDRAWAL LIMIT OF 60 EUROS AS OF TUESDAY, ATMS CLOSED MONDAY- SOURCE* 28-Jun-2015 20:51:22 - FOREIGN BANK CARD HOLDERS WILL BE ALLOWED TO WITHDRAW MAXIMUM LIMIT SET BY THEIR BANKS- SOURCE* 28-Jun-2015 20:53:57 - FOR CAPITAL CONTROL MEASURES TO TAKE EFFECT GREEK CABINET MUST APPROVE COUNCIL RECOMMENDATIONS, PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NEEDED The BBC\u2019s Joe Lynam, though, reports that there is talk of a rather higher limit - at \u20ac200 per day. So the picture remains murky. Another report that ATM limits will be pegged to \u20ac60/day -- it\u2019s a confusing picture right now. I\u2019d got used to not seeing riot police outside the Athens parliament. But they\u2019re back there tonight, guarding the entrance, as hundreds of anti-austerity protesters rally in Syntagma Square Arrivals at Athens airport tonight get an early taste of the situation in Greece: Over in Athens, Greece\u2019s governing Syriza party has now issued an appeal for Greeks to attend a mass rally in Syntagma Square on Monday night to say \u201cNO\u201d to austerity. Helena Smith reports The radical leftists are urging Greeks to rally under the banner: \u201cThe Greek people cannot be blackmailed - cannot be terrorised. Defend Democracy.\u201d The appeal said: \u201cOn the 5th of July we will say OXI (NO) to austerity. We will say OXI to the lenders\u2019 ultimatums. We will say NO to the abolishment of democracy. We will participate in tomorrow\u2019s rally and send a strong message of pride, hope and dignity to Greece and Europe,\u201d The Euro has just plunged at the start of trading in Asia, as the financial markets finally get an opportunity to react to the last 48 hours. The single currency immediately fell 1.5% to $1.101, down from $1.116 on Friday evening. Two nights ago, traders though that Saturday was going to yield a short-term bailout extension for Greece. Greeks will be restricted to taking out just \u20ac60 per day for the next week, and that banks won\u2019t reopen until July 7 -- two days after the referendum has been held. That\u2019s a staggeringly small level -- suggesting that Greece\u2019s banks have been drained all-but-dry by the withdrawals this weekend. The leader of Greece\u2019s largest opposition party has urged Alexis Tsipras to abandon his plan for a referendum. Antonis Samaras, of New Democracy, said Tsipras should consider a national unity government instead: \u201cOur country needs to remain in the heart of Europe and in the euro. Mr Tsipras must continue the negotiations. If he can\u2019t do that by himself, he should attempt a big national consensus.\u201d Louka Katseli, the Yale-trained chairwoman of the National Bank of Greece, has also called for calm. Speaking just before Tsipras\u2019s address, she told Skai TV that: \u201cThese are unprecedented moments that we are living in\u201d Foreign minister Nikos Kotzias is reported to have summoned foreign ambassadors to his office to discuss developments too. A protest has taken place in Athens tonight, calling for Greece to vote NO to Sunday\u2019s referendum, and head towards the exit door from the EU. There are also reports tonight that President Obama has weighed in, telling Angela Merkel to avoid Greece crashing out of the single currency bloc. The US Government has been watching events in the eurozone with growing alarm. And it has now revealed that Treasury secretary Jack Lew spoke with the IMF, Germany and France on Saturday, and urged a resolution to keep Greece in the euro area. Lew also told them that the issue of Greek debt relief must be discussed (as the IMF also argues) Le Monde journalists Adea Guillot has also spotted queues building up at a cash machine, as Greeks respond to the news that capital controls are being imposed. (Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s famous Inaugural Address in 1933, of course) Tsipras\u2019s team are tweeting the key points from his speech tonight: People are still queueing at Greece\u2019s cash machines tonight, reports my colleague Jon Henley in Athens. Tsipras also said he has repeated his request for a bailout extension, beyong the 30 June deadline. That would give the ECB the right to restore emergency liquidity, he adds. It\u2019s official, capital controls are being imposed in Greece, as the financial crisis takes an even more alarming turn tonight. Speaking on live TV, Alexis Tsipras is saying that the Greek central bank has been forced to recommend a bank holiday and the introduction of capital controls. He blames the ECB, and other institutions, for trying to obstruct the democratic referendum he has called for next Sunday. This is a \u201cinsult\u201d that shames European democracy, he says. Tsipras also appeals for calm, and he insists that bank deposits are secure. More to follow Here\u2019s our latest news story on the unfolding financial crisis in Greece: Journalists are gathered outside the PM\u2019s residence, to await the end of the cabinet meeting -- and presumably an announcement on capital controls from Alexis Tsipras/ A few photos of ministers arriving at tonight\u2019s emergency cabinet meeting: This turn of events comes just hours after Greece\u2019s finance minister tweeted that the government opposed the \u2018very concept\u2019 of capital controls within a monetary union. As we covered this morning, Varoufakis also said it would be a failure of European democracy if the eurozone didn\u2019t allow Greece\u2019s banks to keep running. According to the FT, Greece is planning to impose limits on bank transfers, cash machine withdrawals, cheque cashing, and early access to money stores in fixed-term deposits. A wide range of capital controls, in other words. The FT says: Officials said the bank closure would last for several days and would be accompanied by limits yet to be announced on bank transfers abroad and withdrawals from cash machines. The cashing of cheques would be halted and fixed term deposits would be locked down. The Athens stock exchange was also set to be closed. The day\u2019s events followed the surprise move by the Greek government to call a referendum on new bailout terms offered by the country\u2019s international creditors, triggering a rupture with Athens\u2019 eurozone partners and pushing the country closer to exiting the single currency. The closure of Greece\u2019s banks (assuming it\u2019s confirmed) looks like a winding blow to the country\u2019s tourism sector. It surely damages hopes that tourists could help drag the country out of recession soon. The decision to keep Greece\u2019s banks closed was probably inevitable, once the European Central Bank decided this morning that it would not provide any more emergency funding (statement here) By not raising the ELA limits, the ECB left the Greek banking sector with insufficient resources to cope if large numbers of savers tried to withdraw funds. There are reports that the Greek banking sector could remain closed all week, until Sunday\u2019s referendum has been held. The Athens stock market won\u2019t open tomorrow morning either. Greece\u2019s finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, and central bank governor Yannis Stournaras, have told reporters that they have made a \u201crecommendation\u201d to the Greek government. GREEK FINANCE MINISTER SAYS WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATION TO GREEK CABINET THAT WILL BE ANNOUNCED LATER* GREEK CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR SAYS ANNOUNCEMENTS TO FOLLOW CABINET MEETING That cabinet meeting is starting now, and there is talk that prime minister Tsipras will address the nation afterwards. His second pronouncement in 48 hours, following the decision to call a referendum. Bloomberg is also reporting that Greece\u2019s banks won\u2019t open tomorrow: Greece ordered its banks shut Monday to avert a financial collapse after the European Central Bank froze emergency loans to the nation\u2019s lenders. Piraeus Bank SA Chief Executive Officer Anthimos Thomopoulos spoke to reporters after meeting the government\u2019s financial-stability panel in Athens on Sunday. We\u2019re seeing news flashes that Greek banks will not open on Monday, according to the head of Piraeus Bank. That follows today\u2019s meeting of the Greek financial stability council this afternoon, which just broke up. The Greek Financial Stability Council Meeting has just ended, Reuters reports. A Greek solidarity rally has been called for 6pm Monday evening in Trafalgar Square. French President Francois Hollande has called a cabinet meeting for 8am BST on Monday to discuss Greece, Reuters flags up. The British government has updated its advice to people travelling to Greece, to include a warning that cash machines might run short of funds, with little warning. The new advice says (I\u2019ve bolded up the extra line) The currency of Greece is the euro. When travelling outside of the UK, you should take more than one means of payment with you (cash, debit card, credit card).Visitors to Greece should be aware of the possibility that banking services \u2013 including credit card processing and servicing of ATMs \u2013 throughout Greece could potentially become limited at short notice. Make sure you have enough Euros in cash to cover emergencies, unforeseen circumstances and any unexpected delays. (we posted the original advice this morning) Ladbrokes, the betting firm, has slashed the odds of Greece voting YES in next Sunday\\s referendum to just 1/3 (so you\u2019d get \u20ac4 back for every \u20ac3 you put on). Yesterday, when it opened the book, it was offering 2/1 on YES and only 1/3 on NO. But now, the position has been reversed: Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: \u201cAt first we thought the Greek public would dig their heels in, but there appears to have been a u-turn in sentiment and should the referendum go ahead a \u2018yes\u2019 outcome is looking more and more likely.\u201d Greek media are reporting that Alexis Tsipras has called a cabinet meeting in an hour\u2019s time: A group of UK left-leading MPs, union chiefs and charity leaders have signed a letter today calling for a debt relief conference for Greece, and an end to austerity: It says: We call on David Cameron to support the organisation of a European conference to agree debt cancellation for Greece and other countries that need it, informed by debt audits and funded by recovering money from the banks and financial speculators who were the real beneficiaries of bailouts. We believe there must be an end to the enforcing of austerity policies that are causing injustice and poverty in Europe and across the world. We urge the creation of UN rules to deal with government debt crises promptly, fairly and with respect for human rights, and to signal to the banks and financiers that we won\u2019t keep bailing them out for reckless lending.

There\u2019s a petition to cancel Greece\u2019s debts here, too. Failed to mentioned this earlier, sorry, but Greece\u2019s finance minister has released the text of his \u2018intervention\u2019 at yesterday\u2019s eurogroup. It shows that Yanis Varoufakis tried to persuade colleagues that a referendum made sense, as well as being democratic. He said: Colleagues, the referendum solution is optimal for all, given the constraints we face. If our government were to accept the institutions\u2019 offer today, promising to push it through Parliament tomorrow, we would be defeated in Parliament with the result of a new election being called within a very long month \u2013 then, the delay, the uncertainty and the prospects of a successful resolution would be much, much diminished. But even if we managed to pass the institutions\u2019 proposal through Parliament, we would be facing a major problem of ownership and implementation. Put simply, just as in the past the governments that pushed through policies dictated by the institutions could not carry the people with them, we too would fail to do so. The full intervention is worth a read to understand what happened yesterday afternoon: Vodafone, the telecommunications giant, says it plans to keep operating in Greece for the long term. A spokesman tells us: \u201cVodafone has been committed to Greece for the past 20 years and plans to stay committed for the next 20 years.\u201d JUST IN: A statement from Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, just landed in our inboxes. Lagarde is reiterating that the IMF believes Greece\u2019s debt sustainability needs to be addressed -- code for saying that the eurozone must put more money up. And the Fund is still prepared to work with both sides. Lagarde says: \u201cI have briefed the IMF Executive Board on the inconclusive outcome of recent discussions on Greece in Brussels. I shared my disappointment and underscored our commitment to continue to engage with the Greek authorities. \u201cThe coming days will clearly be important. I welcome the statements of the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank to make full use of all available instruments to preserve the integrity and stability of the euro area. These statements underscore that the euro area today is in a strong position to respond to developments in a timely and effective manner, as needed. \u201cThe IMF also will continue to carefully monitor developments in Greece and other countries in the vicinity and stands ready to provide assistance as needed. \u201cI continue to believe that a balanced approach is required to help restore economic stability and growth in Greece, with appropriate structural and fiscal reforms supported by appropriate financing and debt sustainability measures. The IMF is prepared to continue to pursue that approach with the Greek authorities and our European partners.\u201d Apparently, somewhere in that pile of bodies is the Greek finance minister and the country\u2019s central bank governor. They must be heading into that meeting to discuss Greece\u2019s financial stability. The seven-page draft proposal released by the Commission don\u2019t appear to contain any clear reference to addressing Greece\u2019s debt sustainability.... ...even though the accompanying statement states that this issue would have been discussed yesterday. They do show that the EC was offering to set VAT at hotels at 13%, not the top rate of 23% as had been proposed before.... It looks like the Commission is trying to lure Athens back to the table, or persuade the Greek people to push them there. Pierre Moscovici has just tweeted that the door is still open to consider the latest EC proposals, which they just released. And France\u2019s prime minister, Manual Valls, has said this afternoon that he believes Grexit must be avoided. In his second intervention of the day, Valls told i-Tele TV that it was important to respect Greece and democracy, and also European rules. \u201cSo Greece needs to come back to the negotiating table.\u201d The European Commission has just released the latest draft proposal which the two sides were working on until Friday night, when Greece shocked the eurozone by announcing a referendum. It has also claimed that creditors would have considered Greece\u2019s future financing needs, and debt sustainability, at Saturday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Instead, of course, euro finance chiefs decided Greece\u2019s bailout should end on Tuesday night and then planned for the future without Athens at the table. The EC says: Discussions on this text were ongoing with the Greek authorities on Friday night in view of the Eurogroup of 27 June 2015. The understanding of all parties involved was that this Eurogroup meeting should achieve a comprehensive deal for Greece, one that would have included not just the measures to be jointly agreed, but would also have addressed future financing needs and the sustainability of the Greek debt. It also included support for a Commission-led package for a new start for jobs and growth in Greece, boosting recovery of and investment in the real economy, which was discussed and endorsed by the College of Commissioners on Wednesday 24 June 2015. And here\u2019s that draft proposal, which I guess is what the Greek people will be asked to vote on on Sunday -- expect it never became a formal offer. Marks &amp; Spencer has about 25 stores in Greece. This weekend, it declined to make any comment on what it might do should Greece\u2019s banks close. Rival retailer Dixons Carphone, which owns the Kotsovolos chain in Greece, has already said it could benefit from tough times in the country which might force some of its competitors out of action. In fact the company has already done rather well out of Greece\u2019s troubles. Kotsovolos, which has just under 100 stores making it the country\u2019s largest electrical goods retailer, returned to profit in the three months to 2 May as underlying sales rose by more than 8%. The chain benefited from a government scheme helping disadvantaged people with free tablets and laptops. Seb James, chief executive, told The Independent this month that Dixons Carphone has got detailed contingency plans in place if Greece does exit the euro. \u201cObviously we don\u2019t want to see civil unrest because that\u2019s not good for business, but we\u2019ve been there before and are well prepared. Professor Karl Whelan of University College Dublin just launched a blogpost which explains why he thinks some Greek banks won\u2019t open tomorrow. The ECB\u2019s decision to cap emergency liquidity at its current level means capital controls are now coming, he argues. That\u2019s because commercial bank reserves have probably been significantly depleted by the rush to some cash machines this weekend. So, they have little left in cash or reserves at the central bank, leaving them exposed when they open their doors on Monday morning. Professor Whelan explains: In that case, the only way the Greek banks could finance the (presumably very large) demands for withdrawals on Monday would have been to get access to additional funds from the Bank of Greece in the form of additional ELA. That will not be possible now, so most likely the banks will not open on Monday. The statement that \u201cECB will work closely with Bank of Greece to maintain financial stability\u201d is probably code for \u201cECB will help Greece to design a programme of capital controls\u201d. So it has come to this. No matter how well things go from here (and positive scenarios are hard to imagine) restrictions on Greek banks could be in place for a very long time. It is easy at this point to panic and say it\u2019s the end of the world and a new currency must be days away. It\u2019s worth remembering, however, the Cyprus coped surprisingly well with its capital controls and ultimately they were lifted this year and the banking system survived. There is probably still a small window of opportunity left to keep Greece in the euro, even if the banks don\u2019t open tomorrow. The Bank of Greece has denied that governor Yannis Stournaras has threatened to quit if capital controls aren\u2019t implemented, as has apparently been rumoured. A BoG official told Reuters that: \u201cWe categorically deny that Governor Stournaras threatened to resign.\u201d The latest word is that Greece\u2019s financial stability council will start meeting at 4pm BST, or 6pm local time, to discuss the situation. That meeting will be chaired by finance minister Varoufakis (who has already come out against capital controls this morning), and Bank of Greece governor Yannis Stournaras. Dow Jones Newswires reporter Stelios Bouras is taking the mood at the cash machines too: And here are photos of those lengthening ATM queues in Kifisia. Across the Greek capital, our Southern Europe John Hooper spies longer queues at the cash machines: Alarm is growing, even in affluent parts of Athens that were unaffected on Saturday. I am in well-heeled Kifisia, a northern suburb, and I just counted 78 people queuing at four ATMs. There is a more than slightly surreal atmosphere in central Athens today, reports my colleague Jon Henley. Sun shining, cafe and restaurant terraces full, whole families out for Sunday lunch \u2013 and elsewhere, in teleconferences and committee rooms, the nation\u2019s fate (or at least, its near-term economic and financial future) is being decided. Most Greeks I spoke to are confused. \u201cI have a lot of questions,\u201d said Yannis Georgousopoulos, an MBA student. \u201cDo the banks open tomorrow? What actually happens when the bailout ends, Tuesday? If the referendum\u2019s a yes, does the government go? If it\u2019s a No, will the institutions change their mind? It\u2019s just a real mess. Crazy.\u201d Marina, who works for a women\u2019s magazine, and her friend Jenny were anxious about getting at their money \u2013 they had finally found a functioning ATM \u2013 but more worried about what the coming week would do to Greece. \u201cWe\u2019ll tear ourselves apart,\u201d said Marina. \u201cIn fact it\u2019s already started happening. No one really knows what\u2019s going on, no one is really informed, but everyone\u2019s got opinions \u2013 strong opinions \u2026 That scares me.\u201d Neither had a clue what to expect (\u201cWay too many questions \u2013 nobody knows,\u201d said Marina), neither wanted Greece to exit the euro (\u201cNobody wants a Grexit,\u201d said Jenny) and both disagreed over how their government had handled the situation. \u201cTsipras has fought, he really fought,\u201d said Jenny. \u201cI hope he keeps fighting. We should get a better deal than this.\u201d Marina, though, was not so sure the prime minister would be able to \u2013 or even should.\u201cI don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll get a better deal, actually, whatever happens,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s pissed them off now, especially with the referendum. Maybe he should have taken what they offered.\u201d More reaction: We shouldn\u2019t underestimate the importance of this quote, from Greece\u2019s central bank governor: \u201cThe Bank of Greece, as a member of the Eurosystem, will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances.\u201d All measures could potentially mean restrictions on bank withdrawals to get Greece through until next Sunday, and the referendum. Karl Whelan, professor of economics at University College Dublin, fears that Greek banks will struggle to open tomorrow: Other economists agree that the decision to cap emergency liquidity puts Greece\u2019s financial system under even more strain: The European Central Bank has not taken the nuclear option of crashing the Greek banking sector today (although, as covered this morning, it wasn\u2019t really on the cards) But by not providing any more emergency liquidity assistance, the ECB is putting huge pressure on the Greek banking sector, as top officials wonder how they will cope if many Greeks try to withdraw savings on Monday. ELA has been a lifeline that has been steadily raised this year, to make up for the outflow from banks. So by effectively capping it at \u20ac89bn, the ECB has ensured that Greece\u2019s emergency pot will run dry soon. That means Greek officials must now consider what measure they need to take to get the system through the week, until Sunday\u2019s referendum. And as flagged up earlier, Greece\u2019s Financial Stability Council (including Varoufakis and Stournaras) is meeting this afternoon. It\u2019s a classic move from the ECB, avoiding the political decision that Greece is definitely going to do bankrupt. It\u2019s official, the European Central Bank has decided to maintain the emergency liquidity support on offer to Greece, but it has also not provided any extra help. In a statement, the ECB says that it has decided to maintain the ELA ceiling at Friday\u2019s limit (that\u2019s \u20ac89bn). So it hasn\u2019t pulled the plug, but it also hasn\u2019t provided extra funding to cover the funds that have flowed out of Greek banks this weekend. For weeks, the ECB has been agreeing to requests from Greece for extra emergency liquidity, often providing a billions euros or more each week. So if there\u2019s no extra ELA, that is going to make it harder for banks to handle withdrawals, if people keep taking money out. Here\u2019s the full statement: The Governing Council of the European Central Bank today welcomed the commitment by ministers from euro area Member States to take all necessary measures to further improve the resilience of euro area economies and to stand ready to take decisive steps to strengthen Economic and Monetary Union. Following the decision by the Greek authorities to hold a referendum and the non-prolongation of the EU adjustment programme for Greece, the Governing Council declared it will work closely with the Bank of Greece to maintain financial stability. Given the current circumstances, the Governing Council decided to maintain the ceiling to the provision of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to Greek banks at the level decided on Friday (26 June 2015). The Governing Council stands ready to reconsider its decision. Mario Draghi, ECB President, said: \u201cWe continue to work closely with the Bank of Greece and we strongly endorse the commitment of Member States in pledging to take action to address the fragilities of euro area economies.\u201d Yannis Stournaras, Governor of the Bank of Greece, said: \u201cThe Bank of Greece, as a member of the Eurosystem, will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances.\u201d The Governing Council is closely monitoring the situation in financial markets and the potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the balance of risks to price stability in the euro area. The Governing Council is determined to use all the instruments available within its mandate. Varoufakis also insisted that Greece needn\u2019t be forced out of the eurozone. Indeed, there\u2019s no mechanism to exit the single currency. The euro was never designed to solve a problem such as Greek insolvency, and we\u2019ve had a comedy of errors since, he adds. So will you repay \u20ac1.6bn the IMF? Varoufakis replies that Greece is due \u20ac1.9bn in profits which the ECB made on its holdings of Greek banks. We owe money to one part of the troika, and we are owed money by another..... Those profits, though, are likely to vanish from the table if the bailout expires on 30 June (based on what the Eurogroup said yesterday). BBC Radio 4 have just broadcast their interview with the Greek finance minister (live here). Is it inevitable that restrictions will be imposed on how much money people can withdraw from banks? This is a matter that we will have to work overnight on, with the appropriate authorities in Greece and Frankfurt, says Varoufakis. Q: So will there be capital controls? Varoufakis replies: I, as minister of finance, with the Bank of Greece and European Central Bank, will work out what to be done to minimise the burden on our people from Europe\u2019s refusal to grant us our basic democratic right. So he\u2019s not announcing capital controls are certainly coming (as had been rumoured earlier). Varoufakis also argues that it would be a fundamental breach of European democracy if the ECB decides that Greece\u2019s banks shouldn\u2019t be allowed to keep functioning while its Greek people have their say. He\u2019s tweeted this point too: But what about the prospect of the ECB pulling emergency funding today? As a politician, and a European citizen, I find it appalling that we are having such discussions within a monetary union, Varoufakis replies. If it happens, it would mean that: That Europe has failed in its duty to preserve in parallel a democratic process and a monetary union. In a monetary union, a central bank should do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d, and in a democracy the people should be able to vote on momentous issues without seeing their banks shut. More to follow... My colleague Jon Henley reports from Athens: Things are starting to move fast. Reuters is reporting that Greece\u2019s Financial Stability Council is due to meet this afternoon to discuss the banking situation. That council includes of Yanis Varoufakis, his deputy Dimitris Mardas, Central Bank Governor Yiannis Stournaras, and also the head of the Greek Banks Association, the chairman of the HFSF bank bailout fund and the head of the Capital Markets Commission. Even before Tuesday when Greece\u2019s bailout programme expires, another deadline is coming towards Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government like an express train. The end of the month is fast approaching, and with it the payment of wages and pensions which should begin on Monday. That \u2013 and not the bailout expiry \u2013 could trigger the closure of the banks and the shutting down of their cash machines, the daily Ta Nea reported today. It said the government was hoping the central bank would transfer \u20ac1.5bn to keep people from leaving bank counters and ATMs empty-handed. But what no one knows is whether \u2013 with or without the support of the ECB -- the Bank of Greece has the money to transfer. If not, then the banks may well be shut tomorrow as they prepare for restrictions on depositor withdrawals. Even if the central bank can scrape together the funds for Monday\u2019s heavy withdrawals, without ECB support, the retail banks look certain to run out of cash once that wages and pensions have been paid. At that point, restrictions would become inevitable. Ta Nea said that adjusting the country\u2019s ATMs would take two to three days, during which the banks would need to remain closed. Heads-up: BBC Radio 4 is going to broadcast an interview with Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, sometime after 1pm BST (3pm Athens). In it, Greece\u2019s finance minister talks about the ECB\u2019s imminent decision on bank support, and the issue of capital controls. It should be broadcast live here. I believe it\u2019ll be uploaded here once it\u2019s been broadcast. Associated Press reports that some Greek cash machines have been busy again this morning, as we await the verdict of the ECB. Worried Greeks continued lining up at ATM machines Sunday morning, the day after the Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a referendum on creditors\u2019 financial proposals in return for rescue loans. While some machines were running out of cash, others were being replenished. A couple of photos from Athens today: From Athens, John Hooper writes: The European Central Bank was facing one of the most momentous decisions of its brief history on Sunday as its board members considered whether to keep providing more of the emergency lending that has kept Greek banks open despite a steady run on deposits that accelerated dramatically at the weekend. An ECB spokesman declined to comment on reports that the board had already made up its mind to scrap the programme, known as Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA). But a source hinted that talks were already in progress on Sunday morning. Here\u2019s his full take: The European Central Bank has begun holding a conference call on whether to continue providing emergency liquidity to the Greek bank sector. There are various rumour swirling around, so let\u2019s be cautious. Reuters is reporting that the ECB is considering keeping ELA running, but demanding a higher \u2018haircut\u2019 on the assets that Greek banks hand over in return (reflecting the fact that those assets are now riskier). The bigger the haircut, the less liquidity is still available to Greek banks to keep running. It says: \u201cThere is a possibility of an extension,\u201d said one of the people with direct knowledge of the ongoing telephone discussion among the ECB\u2019s decision-making Governing Council, adding that a bigger \u2018haircut\u2019 is being discussed. This chart shows how Greek bank deposits have fallen steadily this year, to an 11-year low. And this chart shows how a higher haircut woulc cuts the amount of extra ELA funding available: In short, it\u2019s the ost Greece\u2019s president has been meeting with senior political leaders today to discuss the situation, following last night\u2019s referendum vote. Prokopis Pavlopoulos has just seen Antonis Samaras, head of the right-wing opposition New Democracy party. He\u2019s now expected to see Stavros Theodorakis, head of the centrist To Potami party. Both parties opposed the decision to hold a referendum, but were outvoted. Looks like there\u2019s been a translation glitch out of Austria, so have updated that earlier post: CORRECTED-AUSTRIA\u2019S FINANCE MINISTER SCHELLING SAYS GREECE WOULD HAVE TO ASK TO LEAVE EU, OTHER COUNTRIES WOULD HAVE TO AGREE (DID NOT SAY GREXIT APPEARS ALMOST INEVITABLE) Apologies for confusion: Here\u2019s the official line from Britain\u2019s government on the crisis this morning: A spokesperson for HM Treasury says: We urge the people of Greece to resolve the current uncertainty, and ensure economic and financial stability across Europe. \u201cWe have taken measures to increase our economic security so we can deal with risks like this from abroad, and we continue to take steps to prepare and protect ourselves from all eventualities\u201d. One senior executive at one of Greece\u2019s largest conglomerates says her firm has taken steps to cope with the possibility of capital controls being imposed. She told John Hooper, our Southern Europe editor, that: \u201cWe are ready for everything.... \u201cWe have foreign banks ready to support us and enough cash to deal with payments inside and outside Greece We have ensured that, for a long period ahead, we have everything we need.\u201d But smaller firms, she added, will be much more dependent on the Greek banks. Here\u2019s John\u2019s take: Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, has flagged up that Greece would have to leave the European Union in order to leave the eurozone. He told the Die Presse newspaper that: \u201cGreece would have to file a request to do so. The other EU countries would have to approve the request. Only then could Greece leave the eurozone.\u201d There simply isn\u2019t a clear way for a country to simply exit the single currency. Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, told my colleague Ian Traynor recently that any country leaving the euro must also leave the EU. The Foreign Office hasn\u2019t changed its advice on managing your finances when travelling to Greece. A spokeswoman tells us that the advice was \u201calways under review\u201d and the FCO website would be updated if necessary. At present, the current advice says: \u201cWhen travelling outside of the UK, you should take more than one means of payment with you (cash, debit card, credit card). Make sure you have enough money to cover emergencies and any unexpected delays.\u201d William Hill, the UK bookmaker, has refused to accept any more bets on Greece leaving the eurozone, after a flood of wagers on an early Grexit. Hill\u2019s spokesman Graham Sharpe says: \u2018The only option people want to back at the moment is that Grexit will happen this year and we can no longer hope to balance the market so we have decided to pull the plug\u2019 Greece is also the 1/3 favourite to be the first country to leave the European Union, followed by the UK at 4/1, and Hungary at 12/1. French PM Manuel Valls also urged Greece to return to the negotiation table and reach a deal: \u201cI cannot resign myself to Greece leaving the euro zone ... We must find a solution.\u201d France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has dropped a clear hint that the European Central Bank should keep supporting Greece\u2019s banks: Speaking on Europe 1 radio, Valls said: \u201cThe European Central Bank is independent, but I don\u2019t doubt it will assume its responsibilities. I don\u2019t think it can cut off support, to put it another way.\u201d Technically, it takes a two-thirds majority at the ECB to reject a request for more emergency funding from a national central bank. Valls also warned Greek voters that a \u201cno\u201d vote in the upcoming referendum would effectively be a decision to leave the euro zone. \u201cThe Greek people must be able to decide lucidly. If there\u2019s a negative vote, there is a real risk ...of exiting the euro zone.\u201d The BBC is reporting this morning that the European Central Bank will vote to \u2018turn off\u2019 Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) for Greek banks at its meeting later today, but many experts are doubtful. Economics editor Robert Peston had blogged that the ECB will conclude that it can\u2019t continue extending credit to Greek banks, given the high risk of the Greek government defaulting. One \u2018well-placed source\u2019 told Peston: \u201cWe think the Greek government will have no choice but to announce a bank holiday on Monday, pending the introduction of capital controls.\u201d ECB to turn off emergency help for Greek banks We\u2019ll find out later today. However, there\u2019s a huge problem with the ECB pulling the plug -- Greece is technically still in a bailout programme for another three days. Crashing the banking sector now would be a deeply political decision, with the referendum coming up. It\u2019s more likely that the ECB would vote to cap the existing ELA, at its current level of \u20ac89bn. That would still leave Greek banks exposed if funds continued to be withdrawn. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis. The eurozone is entering the most perilous period since the creation of the single currency 16 years ago, after yesterday\u2019s dramatic scenes in Brussels and Athens. And today could be just as gripping, Greece is on the brink of default this morning, after eurozone finance ministers yesterday refused to extend its bailout to allow a referendum to be held. And in the early hours of this morning, Greek MPs voted to press on and hold the poll anyway, a week today: The path to that vote looks perilous though. Without the extension, Greece will exit its bailout at the end of Tuesday night, and presumably unable to repay the \u20ac1.6bn it owes the IMF on the same day. The other eurozone finance ministers have already been drawing up measures to protect themselves, as our Europe editor Ian Traynor wrote last night: Europe\u2019s single currency entered the stage of rupture for the first time in its 16-year life on Saturday night when 18 governments told Greece its bailout package would be terminated within days. The country plunged towards financial collapse after its leftwing prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, abandoned negotiations and called a referendum on his lenders\u2019 terms for continuing the lifeline. An emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers took place in Brussels on Saturday evening without Greece for the first time since the crisis began in 2010. It turned into a crisis planning session devoted to quarantining Greece and insulating the rest of the eurozone from the impact of anticipated financial mayhem... EU ministers refuse bailout extension for Greece as referendum looms Attention now turns to the European Central Bank, which must now decide today whether to continue providing the emergency liquidity needed by the Greek banking sector to keep running. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
