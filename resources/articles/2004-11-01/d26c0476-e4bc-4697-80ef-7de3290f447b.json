Pared down to an ensemble of 12 players, Olsen manages a compositional conjuring trick, performed by the Belcea Quartet and a crack team of chamber musicians, conducted by Paul Kildea. Olsen preserved the orchestral sweep of a number such as Reveille, with its vivid percussion writing and woodwind fanfares, but he transformed the effect of Urlicht. This was the song Mahler later used as an upbeat to the finale of this Second Symphony, but in Olsen's arrangement it was an intimate evocation of spirituality rather than a visionary experience, complete with soft-focused lines for the harmonium. There were moments of deft characterisation and drama from baritone Simon Keenlyside and soprano Ann Murray, such as Keenlyside's innocence in the song of the drummer boy being led to his execution, with a chilling accompaniment of a side-drum and a cortege of woodwind chords. He created a vocal bestiary in a song about a singing competition between a cuckoo and a nightingale, presided over by a braying donkey. Murray was impressive in the flowing lines of the Rhine Legend and the emotional intensity of the final number, telling of a soldier's farewell as he goes to war. But in the more intimate numbers, she was often swamped by Kildea's accompaniment; his enthusiastic direction made the instrumental lines clear at the expense of the drama of the vocal lines. Keenlyside stole the show in the first half, with a searing performance of Barber's Dover Beach, accompanied by the Belcea Quartet. After the power of the final climax, describing the hopelessness of life, the music subsided with a hollow viola line. There was more insight in this 10-minute song than in the whole of the Belcea's performance of Mendelssohn's E minor string quartet Op 44 No 2, which for all its sonic power was an exercise in technical brilliance rather than musical sensitivity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
