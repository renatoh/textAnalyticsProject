Coupled with annual snowfalls of 500 inches of air-dried powder, it's little wonder that the state is now almost as popular as its more established neighbour, Colorado, and counts among its regulars Tom Hanks, Dustin Hoffman, and former US president Bill Clinton. What is appealing about this area of the Rocky Mountains is that virtually all the ski resorts fall within an easy 10 to 50-minute drive from Salt Lake City. For example, an Interconnect Day pass costs $150 and allows you to ski five resorts in a day - Park City, Solitude, Brighton, Alta and Snowbird - remarkably inexpensive considering that the price includes transport, guides and lunch. My first three days were spent in the comparative luxury of the Little America hotel in Salt Lake City, where the entire IOC clan are staying during the Games, and which is a short walk to the Olympic Village and Rice Stadium, where the opening and closing ceremonies will take place. But my first action was in Snowbasin, a 50-minute drive north of Salt Lake City, where six Olympic events, including the men's and women's downhill, combined downhill and super G will take place. The conditions were near perfect and I managed a couple of quick warm-up runs before skiing over to the top of the Olympic downhill track where the greats will go for gold. From the start gate, I could admire the snow-covered peaks that form part of the Wasatche mountain range. A quick glance downwards, however, revealed the first perilous 50 yards of what has been rated as one of the world's toughest downhill courses. Designed by former Olympic gold medallist Bernard Russi, racers will reach speeds up to 90mph and complete the 2,770ft course in less than two minutes. It took me around nine minutes before I shuddered to a halt, legs shaking uncontrollably with fatigue and adrenalin. On to Park City, a former mining town and sprawling mass of houses, hotels and apartment blocks. Robert Redford's celebrated Zoom restaurant is here and it's also where all the snowboarding and giant slalom events will take place. Park City is an interesting mixture of gentle terrain and well-groomed slopes. But at the top there are over 750 acres of amazing unpisted powder skiing. Accommodation this time was a small but adequate condominium within walking distance of the new Legacy Lodge, near to the base triple chairlift that takes you up to the Pay Day and Bonanza runs. There's also a free regular bus service into town and one that serves nearby resorts, including the Canyons, destined to become the largest ski area in Utah. Park City is the resort with the liveliest nightlife - no mean feat in a state where more than 70% of the population are Mormons and where strict religious rules still apply, especially where alcohol is concerned. In an attempt to ease this problem, a $5 mandatory \"introductory membership\" fee has been introduced that allows visitors to purchase drinks over the counter in most bars and restaurants. A way round this levy is finding a friendly face willing to \"sponsor\" you for the evening in return for a couple of beers. But bars and clubs still close promptly at 1am. A short distance from Park City, nestling in the Wasatche Mountains, is Deer Valley, Utah's answer to Aspen. This is the venue for all the Olympic freestyle, slalom and combined slalom events. On arrival green-jacketed greeters \"valet\" skis while you change in the comfort of Snow Park Lodge's spacious locker room, a few yards from the base lifts. There is a free mountain guide service led by expert skiers, who are available to ski with you for a couple hours in the morning or afternoon to acquaint you with the lifts and runs. All runs are clearly marked and named, however. The run that will doubtless catch most people's imagination is Know You Don't - the official Olympic slalom course for men and women. But there are plenty of other runs in Deer Valley for all standards. The one thing lacking in Utah is decent mountain restaurants, with skiers normally having to eat in enormous self-service places at the base of the resorts - hence the notices on chairlifts advising early or late sittings in order to avoid \"lunch-hour traffic\". A consolation is that the food is cheaper than in Europe. Deer Valley to Snowbird deemed unsuitable as an Olympic venue owing to the narrow approach road that can lead to traffic jams over weekends. Given half a chance, I would have happily forsaken my Park City condo for the luxury of the Cliff Lodge Spa, a self-contained complex owned by millionaire and mountain enthusiast Dick Brass. Olympic Park is where bobsleigh, luge, ski jumping and Nordic combined events take place. Blinds that can be raised and lowered according to the position of the sun will protect the artificially-refrigerated ice tracks built specially for the Olympics. Anyone with grit and guts and willing to pay $40 can experience the thrill of tobogganing down at speeds up to 90mph. Obviously Salt Lake City is determined to put on the best Winter Olympic show whatever the cost, and in spite of the disastrous publicity that followed its notorious bid, (a fraud trial concerning this is due to start in July). But, even without the Olympics, the skiing in Utah has to be experienced to be believed. The practicals Crystal Holidays (0870 8487000, brochure hotline 01235 824324, website: www.crystalski.co.uk) offers seven nights' skiing in Utah from \u00a3455 per person in April 2001 based on four sharing a suite at the Hampton Inn, close to the multi-ski area and inclusive of return flights from Gatwick, free car hire, deluxe continental breakfast and use of the hotel's indoor heated swimming pool. Ski Utah Passport costs \u00a3201 for six days and allows you to ski in all the Olympic venues. Delta flies Heathrow to Salt Lake City for \u00a3514. A double room in the Little America hotel, Salt Lake City, costs $150 room only, while the downtown Carlton Hotel charges $64 including breakfast. \u0095 Who flies where?
