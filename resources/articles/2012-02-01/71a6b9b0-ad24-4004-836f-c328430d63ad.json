In the circumstances it feels insensitive to speculate on what the financial implications are for the club that Doughty devoted so much time to, yet questions are being asked because of the level of his support. Doughty bought Forest in 1999 for \u00a311m and, according to the last set of accounts, was owed \u00a375.6m by the club, comprising \u00a364.2m of cash plus \u00a311.4m of accumulated interest. His detractors \u2013 and there were many of them towards the end of his time as chairman \u2013 often overlooked the size of his investment. It is understood that Doughty made provision to ensure the club's debts are met for the next two and a half years when he decided to step down as chairman in October amid growing supporter unrest and after admitting that he made a mistake when he appointed Steve McClaren as manager that summer. Doughty's backing meant that he would invest a further \u00a323m between now and the end of the 2013-14 season. The wider issue of what happens regarding the \u00a375.6m that Doughty is owed will only become clear when details of his beneficiaries are revealed. Doughty, 54, was found dead at his home in Lincolnshire on Saturday, 24 hours before Forest were due at Derby County. The match was postponed due to the weather. He was a staunch supporter of the Labour party as well as being a lifelong Forest fan. He leaves a wife and four children, including Michael, a promising footballer with Queens Park Rangers who is on loan at Crawley Town. Doughty is believed to have died from natural causes. \"He was a thoroughly decent man,\" said David Pleat, who worked for Doughty in a consultant role at Forest. \"He had a passion for the club and he ran the club properly. He was a generous, kind and humble man. I have met so many people in football and Nigel, with all his wealth, had real humility. I never saw him angry, and if he lost a football match, he lost it with dignity. He loved Forest; it was his pride. And he was determined to get it back to the promised land.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
