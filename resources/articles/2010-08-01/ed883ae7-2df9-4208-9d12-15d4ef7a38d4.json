The court is considering whether to proceed with a hearing over the 43-year-old's bankruptcy. Oyston resigned his post as executive chairman in unexplained circumstances on Wednesday, also stepping down from the board altogether. The Premier League newcomers said he would continue as chief executive of the club while it seeks a successor. If the courts pursue the proceedings and Oyston is declared bankrupt, he would not be permitted to hold a boardroom role at Blackpool. That is due to bankruptcy falling foul of the Premier League's new directors' test, which replaced the former fit and proper persons' test for this season. Oyston is a highly respected figure in football and has served as a divisional representative on the Football League board. There was widespread surprise in the game at his departure from the Bloomfield Road club. After the success of promotion in the Championship play-off final against Cardiff City at the end of last season, Ian Holloway's side got off to a flying start to the Premier League season with a 4-0 win over Wigan Athletic. But it is not on-the-pitch matters that have led to Oyston's departure. After his club's triumph last Saturday Oyston expressed his dissatisfaction with the activities of agents in their dealings with his club during its first summer in the Premier League. \"There was some accord with some of the things that I did and said in the Championship but there doesn't seem to be any in this division,\" he said. \"Everyone else seems to subscribe to the way that business seems to be conducted and things that I find unacceptable.\" In June Oyston felt obliged to deny that his club had any connection to Maxim Bakiyev, the son of the deposed president of Kyrgyzstan. Valeri Belokov, a substantial shareholder in Blackpool, was a business partner of Bakiyev and according to reports had several investments in Kyrgyzstan during his father's presidency. It is unknown if the current court hearing is connected to the matter. Oyston could not be reached yesterday, but last Friday he said that Belokov's influence on the club had been entirely positive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
