There is no lingering warmth from that win in September, just scalding anger over performances that tottered towards the ignominy of the 4-2 defeat by Bolton at Elland Road on Sunday. He never looks furtive or hunted. A television pundit is a professional smiler and Venables, despite the results, has been projecting gladness ever since he got the manager's job late in the summer. Like any other 59-year-old in his occupation, he is no longer surprised by woe. What must it have been like to stand before the press in Melbourne and explain how Australia had blown a 2-0 lead and so lost their place in the 1998 World Cup finals to Iran? There always has been a debate over Venables, with the sceptics decrying a man who, with just one Spanish League title for Barcelona and an FA Cup at Spurs, has never been a remorseless accumulator of trophies. Admirers cast him as a prophet and their sacred text is the 4-1 scoreline when England beat Holland during an otherwise scrappy campaign in Euro 96. It was as if, given the football stereotypes of the past 30 years, the dunces had trounced the dons in a special edition of University Challenge. The trouble for mid-table Leeds is that tactical acumen, no matter its subtlety, is not the quality they need most. Venables last made an impression two seasons ago, when he was brought in to refine and organise Bryan Robson's Middlesbrough so that the club held on to their spot in the top flight. Venables appeared to have ripened into the perfect management consultant. If a trend ever developed for such specialised work, he would do a nice line in re-engineered football sides. At Elland Road, however, there is a lot more to be done than fine-tuning. Venables, whether he knew it or not, was being thrown into the fight of his life. He is not the only one to be on the end of a few punches. The popular esteem of Peter Ridsdale, the chairman, is badly bruised, even though he will stick around to seek re-election on November 29. If Venables subjected himself to the vote of the Elland Road crowd they would pass a motion of no confidence by a crushing margin. Managers regularly encounter, and sometimes overcome, such difficulties, but one feels Venables has been left in a horrible situation. Leeds were in far greater disarray than he can have realised. Perhaps he thought of them as the club that had finished in the top five of the Premiership every year since 1998. Maybe, like the rest of us, he had a fondness for the fairly recent period when the side were every bit as young and exciting as David O'Leary claimed. Time has brought disillusionment instead of maturity. Some fail to justify their wages and those who merit them look as if they might leave. Transferring Rio Ferdinand and Robbie Keane while acquiring only Nick Barmby and Paul Okon may have put Leeds on a more even keel financially but it has helped to capsize the club. The trial of Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer somehow continued to be destab- ilising even after the verdicts had been reached, particularly because of the widely held view that the latter will depart as a free agent next summer. In their disillusionment, some fans no longer care enough even to try to divine Bowyer's intentions. Leeds are in uproar and in debt. The discordant note will continue if, as feared, compensation for O'Leary cannot be agreed and the whole issue comes before the courts. There is nothing like legal proceedings to force men to live miserably in the past. Venables may deserve sympathy more than blame, but the board seem to have picked the wrong candidate. They required someone to challenge and change every aspect of Leeds. There is a general belief that Ridsdale and the others knew as much. Four months ago, the reports that they wished to recruit Martin O'Neill were incessant. Until the advent of the forceful Irishman in Glasgow, Celtic were a club associated with factions and failure, but discipline and indefatigability are now the characteristics of a team who won easily at Blackburn Rovers last week. Perhaps Leeds will think of O'Neill once more, since his contract with Celtic ends next summer. The magnetism of English football could draw him south, but Elland Road is no longer quite so alluring as it was. If an interview ever takes place, it will be O'Neill who asks the questions and the Leeds board had better have convincing answers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
