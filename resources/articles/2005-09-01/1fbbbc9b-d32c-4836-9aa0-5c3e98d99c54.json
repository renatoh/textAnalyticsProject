This could lead to one or more of China's world-famous terracotta warriors going on show at the British Museum and to Chinese crowds having their first chance to see Egyptian mummies and cuneiform tablets from London. The directors of the British Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum, who are in China with Tony Blair, unveiled the exchange deals after two years of secret preparations. The first result could be as soon as next year, when the V&amp;A expects to host an exhibition of 17th century Chinese porcelain. The other most wanted objects on each country's list will be agreed in a memorandum of understanding in the next few months. Britain is likely to be keenest on recent Chinese archaeological finds and on treasures such as jade burial suits from the Han dynasty, which reigned from 206BC to AD200. China, it is thought, will be avid to see British-owned treasures such as bas reliefs from the Mesopotamian cities of Nineveh and Nimrod and tablets telling the story of Gilgamesh, one of the world's earliest creation myths. One Egyptian artefact, known as the Unlucky Mummy, is to be exhibited soon in China. The country's aspiration is to show its citizens more of the objects which would be found in a \"universal\", not just a national, museum. Under the agreement, the National Museum of China has agreed to lend a major exhibition of its antiquities to the British Museum, whose Chinese collection dates back to its foundation in 1753. To coincide with the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the V&amp;A will host an exhibition of the best of Chinese design. Yesterday Neil MacGregor, the director of the British Museum, said the agreement would allow \"many in China to explore other civilisations and ensure that the audience in London can appreciate the cultural achievements of China\". Mark Jones, the V&amp;A's director, said: \"There is enormous interest in both our countries in seeing cultural treasures from the past as well as learning about the latest design ideas from across the world.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
