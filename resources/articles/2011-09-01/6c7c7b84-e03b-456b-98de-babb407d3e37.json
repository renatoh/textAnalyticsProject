He's probably dog food now'", "bodyText": "Firstly, I read that you had a nasty accident recently. How are you feeling? Yeah, I broke my back in four places in June. I rode again for the first time two days ago, and it was brilliant to be back in the saddle. It didn't hurt, well not when I rode \u2013 I've been aching for two days since. Is that the worst accident you've had? Yes, but it's got competition. I've broken my collarbone, I've been unconscious twice, broke my finger, ripped the skin off one side of my face. And this is something that people say I'm good at. Small Talk grazed itself skiing once and has been scared of snow ever since \u2013 after all those accidents do you not even get a frisson of fear when you're on a horse? Well, just before I get on I might have a flashback to the accident, but you shouldn't ride if you're that nervous. Horses are so big, though, and so terribly easy to fall off. As you know. Are you at least clad in an all-over protective body helmet? I'm wearing a back protector. It's what they wear on cross-country events when they're jumping the really big hurdles. It just means that hopefully if I do have another accident, it won't be as bad as the last one. With the Paralympics coming up, I'm going to keep wearing it for the foreseeable future. I heard you learned to ride on a donkey. Yes, I learned on Sally the donkey. She was a stubborn old thing. She wouldn't turn right, so if I wanted to turn right I had to turn all the way round in the left direction. She was very well behaved with me, but she threw off all my friends. Is donkey-riding anything like riding actual horses? They're not as big, but they give you an idea of what riding horses is like. You've got a living, breathing animal underneath you and it's about building a relationship with that animal. And from the day you met Sally you never looked back? Oh no, I was rubbish for years. I then had a pony that threw me off every day. It was nothing like that. Small Talk will never know what business we might have gone into if we had been continually thrown off our childhood pony \u2013 but we're willing to wager it wouldn't have been a equestrianism. Yes, but I just love horses. It was more the challenge of having another go, and overcoming your weaknesses. I'm just stubborn. Other than racing cars I'm pretty rubbish at everything else, and I'm absolutely allergic to paperwork. Was there a moment when you realised you were actually good? No single moment \u2013 it's taken a lifetime really. The first time I competed against able-bodied riders I was one of many. But in my first year focusing on dressage I became a world champion, and within four years I became national champion against able-bodied riders. I started in 1998, was world champion in 1999 and Paralympic champion in 2000. Crikey, that is some impact. And you've won every Paralympic medal for every event in which you've been entered since 2000. Yes, two individual gold medals and the team gold, in Sydney, in Athens and in Beijing. So if I'm selected to represent the team next year and the team does well, I'd like to win my 12th gold in London. So how good is the British Paralympic equestrian team? Pretty good. We've won the team gold at every major championship since 1994, which is four years before I started competing. That's European, world and Paralympic events. So we've got a strong team, but the other countries are chasing our tail \u2013 literally, given that we're on horses. As a child you were cuddled by Margaret Thatcher. Yes. I remember it vaguely. It was at the Children of Courage Awards in 1980, so I was six years old. She wanted to carry me up the stairs at 10 Downing Street, and I remember my dad saying, \"He's too awkward, I'll carry him.\" And she glared at him and said, \"I'm carrying him.\" It wasn't for show \u2013 there were no photographers there \u2013 she was genuinely involved in the event. And she carried me up the steps of Downing Street, showing me the portraits of all the Prime Ministers. But I knew that when we got to the top of the stairs I was going to be given a toy fire engine, and that's what I was focusing on. That's quite a claim to fame. Have you got any others to rival it? Loads, but nothing I could tell you. My life's been surreal from start to finish. You'll have to wait for the autobiography. Is that in the pipeline? It's in my head, that's where it is. It'll happen one day. Have you got any hobbies? Motorsport. My family say I should concentrate on horses, but I've just got a motorsport license. What do you do with one of those? I'll start by doing speed events, and then eventually I'll reapply for a race licence. You've also got to take an exam and have a medical assessment. At the moment I'm moving house, to my own farm. We've got to build a stables for the horses and everything. And I'm also looking for a motorsport sponsor. That's a totally shameless plug right there. Here's ours. You're speaking to us courtesy of Visa, who sponsor athletes in Team 2012. But with that out of the way, are there any similarities between riding horses and racing cars? Absolutely. It's all about feel, so they use similar ingredients. Whether I'm riding a horse or driving a car, I'm feeling them, judging what they're doing, trying to work out what I can take them up to. You'd ride anything for thrills, that's basically what you're telling me. Probably. I've got a quad bike, which I've raced against neighbours. You could give me a go-kart with a lawnmower engine, I'd still have fun. I like jetskis, speedboats, all the boys' toys. You're having a dinner party and you can invite anyone at all from all of history. Who's on the list? Um, Alan Carr, the camp comedian, because he's funny. I'd invite my mum because she always makes dinner for us and I'd like her to enjoy the experience. [long pause] It would probably just be family and friends. I'm not really into the fame thing. I've met so many celebrities now and everybody's just the same. I'm a bit of a family bird. Fair enough. What's your favourite biscuit A chocolate Hobnob We don't mean to pester, but could you specify what kind of chocolate you've got on your Hobnob? Yes, it's a milk chocolate Hobnob. Don't do the dark chocolate thing with me. Dark chocolate is for posh people. What's the best birthday present you've ever had? [Instantly] A pony. Though that was a Christmas present, is that allowed? Not really. I think I was about nine years old. He was a black pony called Duke and he bucked me off every day. So it wasn't love at first sight? No. I sold him after about a month. He's probably dog food now. Then I gave up for a while and started again in my mid-teens. It's Small Talk's round, what are you having? I'm not a great drinker. I'm usually pissed after one drink \u2013 I'm a very cheap date. I like a Bailey's milkshake, one night a week, or Malibu and Coke. If it tastes of alcohol it's no good. What's your favourite pasta shape? I'm too common to even consider that. One that's easy to get on your fork. I don't like those shells, they've got a mind of their own. We had them the other night and my partner was being entertained watching me trying to stab them on the plate. I like the twisty ones. Fusilli. I love fusilli. Who would win a fight between a lion and tiger? Well I was at [popular Midlands-based theme park and zoo] Drayton Manor the other day with a group of disabled children and they had tigers there that looked pretty fierce. Having said that I've been an inch away from a lion's face in a Norwegian zoo \u2013 they took me into an area that isn't normally open to the public \u2026 The lion's enclosure, from the sounds of things. Well, they were behind some glass. But this lion's head was as big as my torso. They are humongous. But I'm sticking with the tiger. Fair enough. Cheese or chocolate? That depends what mood you're in. I don't like cheese straight after dinner, which is when people usually eat it. I'm always too full. But cheese rather than chocolate. Small Talk couldn't help but notice that you got an MBE in 2001, an OBE in 2005 and a CBE in 2009. At that gong-every-four-years rate, what's Her Majesty going to give you in 2013? I think the next one would be a knighthood. I don't like the sound of \"Sir Lee\", though. It sounds like \"surly\", and that's not me at all. My first name's actually David and I think \"Sir David\" sounds a lot better. It sounds like you've given this a lot of thought.Not a lot of thought, but it has crossed my mind. Probably while I'm brushing my teeth, that's when I do most of my best thinking. Well we'll leave you to get back to the sink, in that case. Thanks for the chat, Sir Lee. You're welcome, Small Talk!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
