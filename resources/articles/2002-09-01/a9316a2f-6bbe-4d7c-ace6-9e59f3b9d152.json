Fulham will earn a win bonus no more easily this season. \"We've become a soft touch at home,\" said Niall Quinn after Sunderland failed to add to their paltry four victories this calendar year. Their last win on home soil arrived almost six months ago and Saturday's defeat at the Stadium of Light followed a similar reverse at Middlesbrough earlier in the week. Quinn added: \"Teams used to hate coming here but now we lack consistency and need to rediscover our desire. \"We're victims of our own success. We scored three and four goals a week when we won promotion and then did well in our first two Premiership seasons. We talked about Europe and set ourselves up for a fall. Things can evaporate quickly.\" As player-coach the Irishman's task is to lift spirits ahead of Saturday's Tyne-Wear derby date at Newcastle. It is a crucial fixture at any time but, with both sides languishing around the foot of the table, the latest episode of this bitter rivalry assumes gargantuan proportions. Quinn added: \"The Newcastle game couldn't have come at a better time. We need to stand up and be counted and to believe in ourselves. We can feel sorry for ourselves and be stuck in a rut or we can stick our chests out and go there and get a win which would be worth 12 or 15 points with the boost it'd give us.\" A fortunate win at Leeds allied to the \u00a310m outlay three weeks ago for Tore Andre Flo and Marcus Stewart - who both looked sadly out of touch - seemed to have bought Reid valuable breathing space. That came to an abrupt halt as those from a stadium-low Premiership crowd of 35,432 who bothered to stay to the end made their feelings known. Chants of \"Reid out\" echoed around the rapidly emptying venue long before the final whistle. Reid said: \"It looked as if we'd turned the corner but there has to be concern at how we lost our discipline. When you do that at this level you put yourselves under pressure. We were all over the place at times. We weren't a team in the second half and looked anxious and lacked confidence. We were ragged.\" As Sunderland manager, Reid has yet to lose a game at St James' Park and he desperately needs to cling on to that record if the chorus of disapproval is not to become deafening. Even victory over their arch rivals, however, will fail to placate many supporters who are desperate to see an end to Reid's seven-and-a-half-year managerial tenure. His side's failings should not detract from a fine display by Fulham, who weathered an early storm to take control and merit a first top-flight win on Wearside in half a century. Junichi Inamoto, their impressive Japanese midfielder, struck his sixth goal of a productive season to put the Stadium of Light on edge. When Barry Hayles muscled Stephen Wright out of the way to double the lead, the dissatisfaction in the stands turned to anger. Several supporters had to be restrained by stewards from putting their views forcibly to Reid. Steve Marlet, again from an Inamoto pass, ensured Fulham's first Premiership victory on their travels this season was rounded off with a flourish and directed Jean Tigana's side towards Thursday's Uefa Cup tie at Hadjuk Split brimming with confidence. Tigana admitted his team had been fortunate in the opening stages but added: \"My aim is to be playing Champions League next season but that has always been the case since I arrived here.\" Man of the match: Junichi Inamoto (Fulham)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
