Those are the results of a survey of 10,000 Australian employees conducted by unions, which found that 40% are working longer hours and 90% are not being paid overtime or penalty rates for extra hours worked. The Australian Council of Trade Unions released the survey on Wednesday ahead of an executive meeting to adopt a charter of rights around working from home. Working from home will be one of the union movement\u2019s major demands as the government attempts to kickstart the economy out of the Covid-19 recession, along with its reconstruction plan proposing renewable energy investments and free childcare. The industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, recently encouraged companies to bring their staff back to the office \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d where safe to do so as part of efforts to restore the normal functioning of the economy. But according to the ACTU survey, workers are not yet ready to give up Zoom meetings in pyjama bottoms \u2013 the reality for many stuck at home during coronavirus lockdowns. The number of workers who spent most of their days at home leapt from 12% before the pandemic to 31% in September, with about the same number reporting they worked once a week (9%) or once a month (6%) at home. According to the survey 81% of workers said they would like to work from home if they were provided with enough support and 47% said they were more productive at home. But working from home has imposed an average $530 in additional expenses on each worker and about a third (32%) reported an increased workload. Despite saving time on the morning and evening commute, most workers (62%) reported starting work before 8am and one in three worked up to or past 9pm. The majority (60%) of home workers reported they were now spending more time as a carer, an issue exacerbated by school closures. Half (49%) of home workers reported experiencing a mental health issue including debilitating workplace health issues like stress, anxiety, depression and self-harm. In a report released alongside the survey, the ACTU argues that a working from home charter should make clear that \u201cthe rights and benefits of those now working at home not be less favourable than what they were prior to the move to home-based work, and that working from home not be grounds for discrimination\u201d. The charter of rights proposes that employers will have to commit that all workers\u2019 time and expenses should be compensated, and workers should have the \u201cright to disconnect\u201d to preserve work-life balance. The other demands are for a safe workplace, connection to other workers through unions, and rights at work including maintenance of all conditions and the prospect of sharing productivity gains. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said the union movement \u2013 which represents 1.6 million workers across all industries \u2013 \u201cwill be working to support our members \u2026 to ensure we lock in fair working from home arrangements\u201d. \u201cWorking from home should be voluntary and people need control over the hours they work,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all need to be aware of the problems if there is not sufficient choice and control, and this survey shows the potential impacts on mental health.\u201d \u201cWe also need to be aware that working from home has particular impacts on women and carers, and we don\u2019t want to see existing gender inequality entrenched through new forms of work.\u201d Many employer groups are yet to develop a policy position on whether and how working from home should continue. In October the Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, told the Ron McCallum industrial relations debate there was a \u201cmixed view\u201d about working from home and the length of Covid lockdowns had revealed \u201cstructural problems\u201d with the practice. \u201c[We\u2019ve] got to make sure we\u2019re very careful about [making] huge assumptions that everyone now will work from home and it\u2019s good for everyone,\u201d she said. Westacott said working from home should be safe and \u201ca choice\u201d \u2013 requiring changes to the workplace system and discrimination laws. Westacott also called for a \u201cgender lens\u201d to ensure women weren\u2019t working from home because the childcare system hadn\u2019t been fixed \u2013 \u201cdenying them opportunities for promotion and advancement\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
