We were together in a consultation game on BBC radio - the only game he ever played with a partner - and he was articulate and relaxed. The game was broadcast in half-hour instalments over several months, and the BBC paid him \u00a350. Bobby was pleased. He had a new passion for tailored suits, and the money paid for a visit to Savile Row. I and others who knew him hope he will now be helped in his psychological sickness rather than punished, and we still wish him well. Whatever happens to him after his detention in Japan, he will remain a chess legend for his feats in 1971-2. Fischer won a record 21 top class games in a row, beat two elite grandmasters 6-0, and, most famously, won the world title against Spassky in Reykjavik. The games were great, but it was the offboard antics which really caught the headlines. Despite the match being turned into a frenzied cold war proxy by the Soviet and American administrations, Fischer turned up late and was finally persuaded to play when the London financier Jim Slater doubled the prize money. Fischer again tried to walk out and was coaxed round by, among others, Henry Kissinger. Spassky defied instructions from Moscow to claim a default, applauded with the audience at the end of Fischer's best win, put his prize money in a Swiss bank and was punished by a travel ban on his return to Russia. One of Spassky's aides, a Russian grandmaster, decided Fischer was using foul means to win and persuaded the organisers to x-ray his chair and dismantle the light fittings above the board, where they found two dead flies. The match led to a boom in chess around the world, not least in Britain. Tournament numbers increased tenfold, and an inspired generation of young British masters made England second only to Russia in world team contests. Fischer himself turned down numerous profitable endorsements, defaulted his official world title (though he still claimed to be champion) and became a recluse. \u00b7 Leonard Barden is the Guardian's chess correspondent"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
