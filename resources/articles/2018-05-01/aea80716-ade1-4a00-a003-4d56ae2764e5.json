Moyes\u2019s donation was not disclosed, but charity the Reading Agency, which runs the scheme, had previously said it would need \u00a3120,000 a year for at least three years to keep Quick Reads going. Moyes said her funds would cover that time frame, and that she would help the organisation find future funding thereafter. \u201cThere\u2019s a political side of me that feels dismayed that it\u2019s down to an individual to keep a scheme that is basically for the public good going. In an ideal world it wouldn\u2019t be me \u2026 but we are where we are,\u201d she said. \u201cWe live in really difficult times and I felt sometimes you just have to put your money where your mouth is, and this is a cause I believe in.\u201d Aimed at the one in six adults in the UK with reading difficulties, Quick Reads publishes entertaining, simply written books by well-known writers from Andy McNab to Malala Yousafzai. Launched in 2006, it announced in April that it was preparing to close. Its funding from Mars Galaxy ended in 2016, and from Arts Council England in 2017, and the quest to find money elsewhere had failed. According to the charity, 95% of literacy practitioners say that Quick Reads has boosted learners\u2019 reading confidence and 91% say the books have directly improved literacy skills. \u201cAs soon as I heard the news I just couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cI\u2019d written a Quick Read myself and I\u2019d recently visited a women\u2019s prison, and thought long and hard afterwards about the importance of literacy \u2026 how impossible it is ever to get ahead if you don\u2019t have reading skills. You are tethered forever to the bottom rung if you don\u2019t have the ability to just be able to read to a certain level, so it seemed incomprehensible to me that this scheme, which was well run, got great results and had a very low-cost outlay in comparison to a lot of charitable schemes [was shutting down]. At a time when libraries were closing, I thought this was nuts. I talked about it to my husband for a weekend and we thought we\u2019d just put in a few tentative inquiries. And here we are \u2026 I am lucky enough to be in a position to help, and proud to provide the support it needs for the next three years.\u201d The funding from Moyes, whose novel Me Before You has sold 8m copies around the world and was adapted for film in 2016, means that Quick Reads will be able to continue commissioning books, with the next new title to be released in 2020. The Reading Agency\u2019s chief executive Sue Wilkinson said the charity \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more thankful to Jojo for recognising the importance of the scheme and so generously providing the funding to enable it to continue\u201d. \u201cIt was with a heavy heart that we announced the end of Quick Reads last month, after seeking ongoing support for the initiative for 18 months,\u201d said Wilkinson. \u201cThe moving testimonies from the public, authors and all of our partners last month demonstrated how much they value these wonderful books and how Quick Reads have touched so many people\u2019s lives. As a charity, we are continually working to secure enough funding to keep our high-quality programmes running and support the 1.4 million people who rely on our work each year, so this is an extraordinary gift.\u201d Moyes said she would also be more involved with the scheme. \u201cMy aim is to give them a three-year window, so hopefully I can encourage other people to support them. My intention is to make publishers take a bigger role as well, because if we don\u2019t feed the seedbed of reading then frankly we\u2019re not going to have readers. It\u2019s in their interest to have this scheme not just survive, but flourish,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
