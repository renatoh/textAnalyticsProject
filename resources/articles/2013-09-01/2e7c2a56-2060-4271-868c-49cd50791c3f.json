Tuesday's was no exception. But the 2013 vintage was a substantively different and better kind of speech than its predecessors. In his previous autumn conference addresses, Mr Miliband has been strong on clever concepts but weak on both grittier substance and upbeat credibility. Over recent months, and with his rating dipping, the call has been for the clever positioning and brainy phrase-making to give way to commitments of substance and a stronger sense of leadership. Mr Miliband has clearly been listening because that was what he delivered in Brighton. As ever, though, Mr Miliband still likes to make a speech with a framing idea \u2013 a leitmotiv like the responsible capitalism call in 2011 and the one-nation Labour refrain in 2012. This year's recurrent line was that \"Britain can do better than this.\" This served two rhetorical purposes in one. First, it allowed the Labour leader to fold his earlier calls together to produce an upbeat pre-election message that the Conservatives' \"global race\" can also be a race to the top not the bottom. Second, it allows Labour to acknowledge the economic recovery while demanding that its proceeds are more fairly shared. Will this \u2013 or any other clever phrase \u2013 be a strong enough argument for change to fight off the inevitable coalition claim to have mended an economy that another Labour government might ruin? This remains work in progress. Mr Miliband got on to stronger ground when he became more substantive. The speech was full of the kind of pledges that were so noticeably absent from his previous conference addresses and for which critics have been calling. Some were familiar or had been well trailed \u2013 votes at 16 and 17, repeal of the bedroom tax on claimants, 50% of Labour MPs to be women. Others had been leaked but were still essentially new \u2013 a boost for small businesses (traditionally a favoured target for Tory largesse) by reversing planned increases in business rates from 2015 while also scrapping a 1p cut in corporation tax for large firms. But the politically big announcements \u2013 big both in their potential material impact and in their symbolic significance as vote winners \u2013 were on housing and on fuel bills. The pledge to be building 200,000 homes a year by 2020, along with the renewed emphasis on new towns, is arguably the most important of the lot, a generational shift that is massively needed on both economic and social grounds. The freeze on energy prices from 2015 to January 2017 provided the speech's big untrailed moment, going to the heart of what the Labour leader sees as a national crisis over living costs and corporate profiteering. It is probably the sort of pledge that Mr Miliband would have preferred to keep under wraps but was forced to reveal because of his poor poll ratings. But it is a thoroughly healthy political move to confront energy market manipulation. If the opposition leader has sparked an electoral bidding war on utility costs, then so much the better. There were omissions in the speech. Nothing about HS2, on to which Ed Balls had poured cold water on Monday but which shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle went out of her way to supporton Tuesday. Which side is the leader on? Nothing on Europe either. And the issue of party reform, which Mr Miliband had propelled up the agenda in the spring, was not substantively addressedon Tuesday, any more than it had been at the TUC earlier. That issue remains a looming test for Mr Miliband's leadership next year. But he went out of his way to assert his leadership credentials towards the end, making an issue of the contest of character with David Cameron. Was it wise for a man who trails his party in the polls to emphasise himself rather than the party? Time and the opinion polls will tell. But this was a tough and engaged speech, warmly received. Mr Miliband can be well pleased with a good day's work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
