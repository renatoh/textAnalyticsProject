Last year, two web-based events made news and were dismissed in the same way: Egg's online banking customers being able to access other customers' details, and Dell customers attempting to purchase a speaker system at a tenth of its \"actual\" price. If system designers accept that users will make inevitable mistakes, they are in a unique position to understand these mistakes and create systems that allow their results to be corrected. There are methods at their disposal: cognitive modelling, monitoring of critical incidents, prototyping and testing. People are willing to accept human error as the cause of a tragedy - the lone gunman explanation. Systems psychology has yet to fully permeate the public's understanding of science, and commentators must play an active role instead of dismissively claiming human error as the cause of all problems. Gerred Blyth gerred@amber-light.co.uk 2003 wish list What a geeky load of things you think we ought to know in 2003 (Online, Jan 2). Human beings, trying to survive and earn bread in the real world, need very different things. Among them are: an easier user-interface for the 50% of humans resistant to screens and keyboards, accurate health records available instantly and anywhere, tougher security to deter terrorist hackers, tighter data-standards to cope with the Tower of Babel of XML dialects, and cheap high-speed wireless connections across the country. By the end of the year, I predict we will have to protect ourselves against the obscene spam likely to be released by mobile picture messaging.

In 2003 they may enter the dictionaries, so we'll all have to move on.\" Reaching for my copy of the Encarta Concise English Dictionary I find that \"blog\" was listed as far back as 2001 - as a noun and a verb. You should have moved on more than a year ago! Gordon Kerr gordon_kerr@bloomsbury.com IT surgery Unlike Bernard Mathews (Feedback, 2 January), I have never been involved in implementing any hospital IT system. As an end user, I can see how appropriate IT systems could make my job (as an anaesthetist) more effective. I can see how a single system to manage an entire hospital may well be so complex as to be unmanageable and like him, I believe the future lies in smaller single-department systems. My hospital has been procrastinating over the purchase of an operating theatre management system (TMS) from at least 20 commercial systems available. We have been pressured into using the system in use by our sister hospital. That system is badly in need of an update. NHS should centrally write the software for such systems, which would then be released under an open source licence. The software would be stan dard issue to all NHS hospitals and by being open source, generic systems could then be customised by individual hospitals. However, I think the battle is already lost. The decision to spend \u00a32.5 billion of NHS IT money in the private sector has already been made. It is government policy to stuff as much public money as possible into private pockets. Yoav Tzabar Strathmuiryoav@tzabar.org Sync is a cinch Ashley Norris (Online, December 19) seems to imply that, with a Palm OS PDA, you have to have third party software to be able to synchronise your contacts in Outlook with your PDA. I don't know about other brands, but that is not so with Palm devices - as you install the software, you are asked if you want to use Outlook as your default; click \"yes\" and everything syncs to that rather than the Palm Desktop. No need to create CSV files, or generally confuse yourself - everything is automatically synced every time, and if you are unfortunate enough to run out of battery on the PDA, all you need do is synchronise again once you have put a new battery in.
