In a joint commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and the 50th anniversary of the death of Bohuslav Martinu the Czech-themed programmes feature what is believed to be the first complete cycle of Martinu\u02da's piano concertos to be undertaken in the UK. Not that there is anything stylistically Czech about Martinu's First Piano Concerto. Far from it, the work, written after the composer had emigrated to Paris, shows him turning away from the folk-inflected Romanticism of his youth and embracing the cosmopolitan style of neoclassicism. Hints of Stravinsky, jazz and references to baroque music abound in a boisterous, uncomplicated work that is worlds away from the Czech nationalism of Dvorak or Martinu's contemporary Janacek. Soloist Piers Lane took a flamboyant larger-than-life approach to the concerto that seemed entirely in keeping with its jazzy insouciance. That he wasn't taking the piece too seriously was reinforced by his choice of encore: Dudley Moore's Beethoven parody on the Bridge Over the River Kwai whistling theme. If Martinu's concerto was pure entertainment, it was in sharp contrast to Janacek's orchestral ballad that preceded it. The Fiddler's Child is a disquieting work, its discordant intensity underscored by its spare musical language, expressed clearly in the contrast between Elizabeth Layton's sweet-toned solo violin and the harsh orchestral interjections. Dvorak's symphonies are another of the Bohemian Rhapsodies series; here it was the good-natured Eighth that was the sole work in the second half of the programme. Native Czech conductor Petr Altrichter, making his debut with the BBCSSO, didn't provide any remarkable insights into the piece, though there was a natural sense of flow to this performance that was easy to enjoy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
