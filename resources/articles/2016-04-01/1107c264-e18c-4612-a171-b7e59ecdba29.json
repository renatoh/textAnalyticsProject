As the bus gathers speed on its journey up the A1402 towards the airport, Newcastle may have turned a significant corner and find themselves pointing in a promising new direction. Alternatively, the club could be contemplating Championship football, with Ben\u00edtez tacitly acknowledging that the challenge of keeping them out of it is a more poisoned chalice than even he had envisaged. Well before they land at Samson Aviation, a private terminal tucked discreetly away from the public\u2019s prying eyes in a quiet corner of Newcastle airport, the future will have begun to be mapped out. Should Ben\u00edtez\u2019s new side lose to 17th-placed Norwich they will be red-hot favourites to finish second bottom ahead of Aston Villa and it would take a particularly brave player to venture out from the sanctuary of their gated mansions in nearby Woolsington, Ponteland and Darras Hall this weekend. Win, though, and they will be level on points with Alex Neil\u2019s side with a game in hand and the prospect of next season\u2019s exciting \u201cRafa-lution\u201d to play for. If things go wrong, the former Valencia, Liverpool, Internazionale, Chelsea, Napoli and Real Madrid manager is almost certain to walk away, leaving Tynesiders agonising about the prospect of what might have been. As things stand, the possibilities are tantalising. Providing survival is secured, the Spaniard has carte blanche to rip up the club\u2019s flawed management structure and recruitment strategy while enjoying the sort of autonomy the ultimately cowed Alan Pardew and Steve McClaren probably did not even dare dream about. Ben\u00edtez, however, is in effect managing with one arm tied behind his back. Newcastle\u2019s board may have spent \u00a382m on new players this season but their refusal to listen to McClaren\u2019s pleas for a left-back, a centre-half, a decent back-up goalkeeper and a reliable goalscorer threatens to bite them on the backside. It does not help that the squad consistently top the Premier League injury charts, with 11 senior professionals undergoing treatment this week. Their number includes Rob Elliot, a revelation in goal since replacing the seriously injured Tim Krul last autumn but now another casualty statistic after rupturing a cruciate ligament playing for the Republic of Ireland last week. His replacement, Karl Darlow, has made one, distinctly iffy, league appearance this season. Not that Darlow\u2019s latest manager sees things in quite such a bleak light. \u201cWhen I received the news about Rob I was thinking: \u2018Pfft, I cannot believe the injuries we have,\u2019\u201d said Ben\u00edtez, who lost his first game 1-0 at Leicester City before securing a 1-1 home draw with Sunderland, on Friday. \u201cIt was very bad news for us. \u201cBut afterwards I realised we still have a good keeper in Karl, we have to support him and prepare the team to do well. This morning when I was coming here I was thinking about that. We have eight games to play, so why say: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s impossible to stay up.\u2019 It\u2019s not impossible. At the moment we have the players doing what I\u2019m asking. They\u2019re following instructions and working really hard. We\u2019re going in the right direction \u2013 we just have to convert these things into wins.\u201d By uncanny coincidence Friday was seven years to the day since Alan Shearer\u2019s unveiling as Newcastle\u2019s manager at a packed St James\u2019 Park press conference, with the club\u2019s former captain and England striker given eight games in which to stave off relegation. One win, two draws and five defeats later Newcastle were consigned to the drop at Aston Villa, where home fans taunted them with banners inquiring: \u201cWho\u2019s your next Messiah: Ant or Dec?\u201d At least Shearer\u2019s latest successor possesses a slightly different coaching pedigree. \u201cIt\u2019s different to when Alan was here,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said, somewhat diplomatically. \u201cThe only shame is that we can\u2019t bring Shearer back again as a striker; he could score some goals and that would be helpful.\u201d While their penchant for conceding goals represents a considerable problem for a Newcastle defence in which France\u2019s Moussa Sissoko is likely to be played out of position at left-back on Saturday, scoring them is far from this team\u2019s forte either. Concerned about this drought, Ben\u00edtez swiftly hired Allan Russell, a Glaswegian former striker turned specialist attacking coach, to offer his shot-shy centre-forward Aleksandar Mitrovic one-to-one tuition. When Mitrovic headed home Gini Wijnaldum\u2019s cross to earn Newcastle a point against Sunderland, this move appeared inspired but Ben\u00edtez seems likely to resist resorting to the sort of fundamentalist cross-propelled tactics best suited to the Serbia striker\u2019s game. Instead, he hinted that a newly fit Papiss Ciss\u00e9 could possibly replace him. \u201cYou can go wide and high and have good crosses but in England the strongest part of the majority of teams is the centre-backs in the air, so I don\u2019t think we just need to concentrate on crosses we know are important for Mitrovic,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cWe have Ciss\u00e9; maybe the attack can be in a different way. I can see Ciss\u00e9 giving us a hand. He\u2019ll be a big boost for us.\u201d The 55-year-old likes his teams to pass intelligently but this Newcastle squad have generally enjoyed most success adopting the low possession, counterattacking tactics with which Pardew propelled them to a fifth-place finish. Arguably, part of McClaren\u2019s failure was down to a bold attempt to alter the team\u2019s philosophy, with his introduction of the subsequently abandoned so-called \u201csix pass rule\u201d proving especially disastrous. The idea was that the team made six, normally sideways, passes to ensure they \u201ccontrolled the phase of play\u201d before advancing, with this policy not only failing to enable them to \u201cpass through\u201d opponents but proving even more self-destructive than the similarly patient approach Louis van Gaal forlornly endeavoured to introduce at Manchester United. Gameplans aside, McClaren \u2013 who would have given a lot to swap his head coach title for the power-suffused manager label Ben\u00edtez demanded \u2013 was hindered by the board\u2019s insistence on signing players aged under 26, leaving him low on leadership. Although that rule is now scrapped, his successor has necessarily inherited the same deficiency. Perhaps tellingly, an upbeat media briefing punctuated with repeated use of \u201cconfidence\u201d and \u201cself-belief\u201d \u2013 McClaren, who liked his buzzwords, would have approved \u2013 featured Ben\u00edtez seeking to play down the leadership issue, which he has addressed in individual meetings with players. \u201cThey realise it\u2019s time to do things better,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know they\u2019re responsible for this situation. I don\u2019t think anyone wants to go down; it\u2019ll be bad for everyone if we do.\u201d Jamaal Lascelles is certainly buying into the new mantra. \u201cThe gaffer\u2019s starting to get a reaction from us,\u201d said the centre-half. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a lot of brilliant tactical stuff and our ball play\u2019s been a lot better. Everyone\u2019s much more passionate. There\u2019s a desire to win and do well.\u201d With Newcastle in danger of missing out on next season\u2019s \u00a3100m-plus Premier League broadcasting bonanza and losing Ben\u00edtez, Mike Ashley can only hope the biggest, and most welcome, volte-face of his Newcastle ownership has not been made too late. \u201cThe stature of this club\u2019s massive,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said, a little wistfully. \u201cIf we can stay up we can build something here. We can do well.\u201d If, if, if \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
