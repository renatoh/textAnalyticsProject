Almost three years ago we highlighted that loneliness and isolation among disabled people is a critical issue, with one in four feeling lonely every day. However, it seems not much has changed in terms of loneliness and life satisfaction \u2013 it is still a major issue. Many of the contributing barriers, such as the need for accessible transport and buildings, financial support and appropriate social care still exist, and in areas such as social care the situation has even worsened. A lack of understanding and awareness of disability is also a significant obstacle; nearly half of non-disabled people feel that they do not have anything in common with disabled people, and 26 % admit to avoiding engaging in conversation with a disabled person. It\u2019s time society was made truly accessible, and this includes providing the right social care to disabled people so they can be full and active members. Richard Kramer Chief executive, Sense \u2022 The Office for National Statistics findings show businesses are failing those with a disability. Business leaders have continued to underestimate the value of disabled people for too long \u2013 people should not be excluded for simply being different. It\u2019s disappointing to see that the area where this disparity is the greatest is London, where disabled people are being paid 15.3% less than non-disabled employees. It\u2019s time that businesses stand up and ensure disabled people are fully included. We\u2019ve seen over 200 CEOs commit to this by joining The Valuable 500, but others need to make closing the gap a priority \u2013 the gap needs to close and businesses need to be the ones to do it.
