Held in a natural amphitheatre in Sydney's finest green space, the films are an eclectic but enjoyable mixture of directors' cuts and new releases. Sealing its position is this year's Gold Grass experience. For AS$30 (\u00a312.70), a little more than the price of entry to a British multiplex, you get a prime position, a glass of bubbly and a special beanbag to lounge on.
