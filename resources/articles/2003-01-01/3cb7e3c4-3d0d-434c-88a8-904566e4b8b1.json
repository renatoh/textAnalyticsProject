None of the 70 passengers was injured in the incident near Redhill but some were suffering from shock, British Transport police said. \"The cause of this derailment appears to be a landslide caused by the recent heavy rain,\" a spokesman said. Network Rail said the derailment, of a train travelling from Brighton to London, was being classed as \"minor\" and that services would be affected for three to four hours before the eight-carriage train was put back on the tracks. \"The train was derailed on the London side of the Merstham tunnel due to a small landslip,\" said Network Rail. \"The front two sets of wheels of the front carriage came off. Both lines were blocked but there is a diversionary route so it's still possible to get to Gatwick and Brighton.\" The accident occurred as more than 80 flood warnings were issued in northeast, central and southern England as swollen rivers came close to bursting their banks. \"Anyone living or working in a vulnerable area is urged to take urgent action now to help protect their property,\" said Ray Kemp of the Environment Agency. The agency said one of the worst hit areas was the village of Yalding in Kent, which was flooded overnight after almost an inch of rain fell in the early hours. Heavy rain hit the traditional New Year's Day sporting fixtures. The Premier League match between Fulham and West Bromwich Albion was among 11 games called off. The Met Office warned of more heavy rain late today and tomorrow, followed by colder and drier conditions at the weekend. \"The rain keeps on coming,\" Met Office national forecaster Martin Rowley said. \"There'll be prolonged heavy rain tonight with another dose lasting much of Thursday.\" He said rainfall was nearly a third higher than the average, with about 4.7 inches falling in the last month. Unseasonably mild winter temperatures were blamed for the persistent rain in Britain in recent weeks. Temperatures in parts of southern England reached 13C (55F) on Wednesday, well above the seasonal average of about 7C (45F). The Environment Agency said the flooding was far less severe than in autumn 2000 when floods damaged 10,000 homes and caused an estimated \u00a31bn of damage. After those floods the government pledged an extra \u00a351m for flood defences after it was accused of failing to do enough to tackle the threat. Earlier today, Devon firefighters rescued five people from their flood-trapped cars, and the Devon fire service dealt with a number of flooded properties in Paignton, Torquay and Lympstone. Properties were also flooded in Helston in Cornwall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
