The artist\u2019s name. Though many of the artists\u2019 names were not recorded, and will forever be anonymous, many that have been recorded are now being recognized as never before. Hearts of Our People: Native Women Artists is the first ever museum retrospective of Native American and Canadian female artists. It opened at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, and until 18 August, over 115 artists from 50 Native communities are being given the credit they deserve. \u201cThis is the first, believe it or not, show devoted to Native women artists,\u201d said Jill Ahlberg Yohe, who co-curated the exhibit with Teri Greeves. \u201cIt\u2019s the first to honor Native women from ancient times to the contemporary moment.\u201d Then why did it take so long? Most 19th-century art collectors were \u201cmen with a Victorian sensibility,\u201d Yohe said. For the most part, these men weren\u2019t interested \u201cin identifying women, or individualizing Native people\u201d. She added: \u201c90% of Native art is made by women. Native artists know this. It\u2019s just non-Native people who haven\u2019t recognized that.\u201d Yohe has been working on this exhibition since 2015. \u201cIt dawned on me after scouring the collections that all the work is made by women,\u201d she said. Putting together the show meant more than just plucking out items from renowned collections. Rather than repeating the same old narratives, the co-curators wanted to incorporate fresh voices. That led them to working with 21 women, both Native and non-Native scholars and artists, to curate this show as part of their \u201cexhibition advisory board\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s what made it special,\u201d said Yohe. \u201cWe have the voices, expertise and knowledge from all these women.\u201d Upon entering the exhibition, there\u2019s a parked 1985 Chevy El Camino by Rose Simpson, a work which pays homage to the 20th-century potter Maria Martinez, \u201cthe first self-identified non-anonymous Native artist,\u201d said Yohe. That sets the tone for the entire show, which is divided into three sections: legacy, relationships and power. The exhibition includes the work of 12 Canadian artists to trace tribes and communities that were established long before borders between the two countries. \u201cThe borders between the US and Canada weren\u2019t created by indigenous people, but by outside influences,\u201d said Yohe. \u201cAll this work is connected to our history, whether it was made in 1500 or 2019. It\u2019s all a part of the American and Canadian story.\u201d M\u00e9tis artist Christi Belcourt shows The Wisdom of the Universe, a painting from 2014 that features animals on the endangered species list in Canada, alongside Haida fashion designer Dorothy Grant, who sketches Haida artwork on to clothing, is showing her wool Hummingbird Dress from 1989, the same year she debuted her first collection. Though craft and fashion play a role in this exhibit, it\u2019s not where it ends. \u201cIt\u2019s the gendered aspect of women\u2019s work,\u201d said Yohe. \u201cThese categories don\u2019t work; they just don\u2019t work in Native communities.\u201d One of the most fun pieces in the exhibit is a pair of heels by the Luise\u00f1o/Shoshone-Bannock artist Jamie Okuma, who is showing her Adaption II shoes from 2012. The artist has taken a pair of Christian Louboutin heels and covered them in what Yohe calls \u201cNative couture\u201d \u2013 including the likes of glass beads, porcupine quills and buckskin. The work counteracts the stereotype that Native art lives in the past and lacks sophistication. The Creek-Cherokee artist Joan Hill is showing her 1990 painting Women\u2019s Voices at the Council, which shows the head of a tribe, a woman she refers to as the \u201cBeloved Woman\u201d, meeting with other women as part of the decision-making for their tribe. Haida artist Freda Diesing shows Mask, Old Woman with Labret from 1974, which depicts a woman with a labret, a body modification known as \u201clip plugs\u201d, which were recognized as status symbols for women on the north-west coast. (Diesing was one of the few female carvers of her generation and her Haida name Skil Kew Wat means \u201cmagical little woman\u201d). The artworks here are more than just decorative or folk-art masterpieces. They offer an overlooked, often silenced narrative. \u201cTheir work tells the story of Native people, the idea of resilience, despite all measures of annihilation of federal policy, settlers and acts of genocide,\u201d said Yohe. The Anishinaabe artist Rebecca Belmore shows Fringe, a sculpture from 2007, which draws attention to the violence against First Nations women with a gaping back scar the artist believes will never disappear. But this exhibition is, in part, about healing. For one, it aims to be a counter-narrative. They\u2019re calling it \u201ccorrective art history\u201d to the dusty old textbooks that ignored them for decades. \u201cIt\u2019s long overdue,\u201d said Yohe. \u201cNative women\u2019s art history is American history.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 June 2019 because an earlier version referred to the painting The Wisdom of the Universe as a tapestry.
