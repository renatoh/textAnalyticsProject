Three golden boot winners in the squad but no goals so far. Their reliance on Zinedine Zidane has been confirmed in his absence. Their 1998 success was built on a solid back four but age appears to have taken its toll. Not helped by bickering or the Thierry Henry tackle against Uruguay. What must they do? Defeat unbeaten Denmark by at least two clear goals - which could even see them win the group. How confident are they? \"It's not such a big mountain to climb\" - full-back Bixente Lizarazu Survival prospects 4/10 URUGUAY Winners in . . . 1930, 1950 What's their problem? Never expected to pose a major threat. They qualified via a play-off against Australia and their best days are long behind them. Too many of their stars played little club football last season. Not tight enough at the back against Denmark and lacked ambition against 10-man France. What must they do? Beat Senegal by a two-goal margin, although a win by one goal will be enough if France triumph by two. How confident are they? \"So far we've created 10 good chances to score, so at least that's something\" - coach Victor Pua Survival prospects 3/10 GERMANY Winners in . . . 1954, 1974, 1990 What's their problem? Far more vulnerable at the back than has traditionally been the case. Badly hit by injuries with Jens Nowotny, Sebastian Deisler and Mehmet Scholl not even travelling. What must they do? Draw with Cameroon and they're safe. How confident are they? \"We will not lose. The 1-1 against Ireland was quite good - victory would have been followed by a holiday-week and the tension would have been lost\" - multiple World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer Survival prospects? 8/10 ARGENTINA Winners in . . . 1978, 1986 What's their problem? Started serenely against Sweden but slipped up against England. Played the second half without their captain and inspiration Juan Sebastian Veron. Not entirely convincing in defence without Roberto Ayala and are they, like France, too tied into one system, with only one man up front? What must they do? Beat Sweden, although a draw may be enough if England lose, depending on the goals in those two games. How confident are they? \"I am convinced we will win. It will be 2-0\" - forward Ariel Ortega Survival prospects 7/10 ENGLAND Winners in . . . 1966 What's their problem? Hardly in crisis - at least not until tomorrow. Sluggish, wasteful in possession and tactically poor against Sweden. Responded perfectly to beat Argentina. Repeat performance against Nigeria will surely suffice. What must they do? Avoid losing to Nigeria. How confident are they? \"If we slip up now it would be absolutely ridiculous\" - skipper David Beckham Survival prospects 8/10 ITALY Winners in . . . 1934, 1938, 1982 What's their problem? Blame decisions by Graham Poll and his assistants for their 2-1 defeat by Croatia. But the game highlighted the defensive reliance on Alessandro Nesta. With an uninspiring midfield, will they need to play Francesco Totti behind two strikers? What must they do? Beat Mexico, or draw if Croatia do not beat Ecuador. How confident are they? \"We always suffer in qualification - it's nothing new. I am an optimist but also a realist\" - coach Giovanni Trapattoni Survival prospects 6/10"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
