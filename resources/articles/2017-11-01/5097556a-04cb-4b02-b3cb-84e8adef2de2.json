Scientists at the University of Bath are developing fake human excrement to help them understand the drying process of faecal sludge. Made from a concoction of ingredients including yeast, hemp fibre, shredded tissue, peanut oil, calcium phosphate and water, the lab-created sludge is designed to replicate the chemical and physical properties of faeces as closely as possible. The scientists hope that by studying the sludge they will be able to help the 2.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a flushing toilet and rely on static sanitation systems, like pit latrines, to deal with their waste. \u201cDeveloping and testing batches of fake poo isn\u2019t something many people can say they do as part of the day job,\u201d said Naomi Deering, postgraduate researcher in faecal sludge management at the University of Bath. \u201cThis area of research at times may not be the most pleasant but the potential impact of this project makes this work so worthwhile.\u201d A lack of suitable disposal sites, as well as poor understanding of the risks involved, means sludge is often deposited in fields and rivers. Germs found in it cause illnesses, such as diarrhoea \u2013 responsible for the deaths of more than 750,000 children under five every year. The scientists are examining what happens to the sludge when it is exposed to natural sunlight and heat. As it loses water, the temperature within the sludge rises, killing off parasite eggs and pathogens such as E coli and salmonella. Once dried to a suitable consistency for removal, the sludge can be composted to allow safe use in agriculture as a soil conditioner. \u201cThe development of a low-carbon solution for faecal sludge management has the potential to transform the lives of millions of people around the world,\u201d said the university\u2019s Sukumar Natarajan., director of the University of Bath\u2019s Centre for Doctoral Training in Decarbonisation of the Built Environment (dCarb). The researchers hope their project will have a significant impact in reducing illness and death associated with the unregulated disposal of faecal sludge, and provide vital information for governments and NGOs about how best to dry it out using low-cost, low-energy solutions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
