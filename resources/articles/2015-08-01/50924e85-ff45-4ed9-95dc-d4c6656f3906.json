That\u2019s it. One debate in New Hampshire,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, adding that the New Hampshire debate was \u201ccynically wedged into the high point of the holiday shopping season so as few people watch it as possible\u201d. Parts of his speech demanding debates received standing ovations from the crowd. After he spoke, there was frost in the air between O\u2019Malley and the DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, as the governor left the podium, which led many on Twitter to believe that she snubbed him. In fact, they did shake hands \u2013 but with visible enmity. O\u2019Malley has long expressed frustration with the DNC for scheduling just four debates before the first primary in Iowa, and just six in all. By contrast, the Republican party has 12 primary debates scheduled. He told the Hill in May on the campaign trail in Iowa that the DNC was trying to \u201cpreordain the outcome [for Hillary Clinton], circle the wagons and close off debate\u201d, and said that he had raised the issue with Wasserman Schultz. Speaking earlier in the day, Clinton kept her focus on her potential Republican opponents. She said that \u201cthe party of Lincoln has become the party of Trump\u201d, and described the other 16 candidates in the Republican race as \u201clike Trump without the pizzazz or the hair\u201d. In a thinly veiled reference to Clinton, leftwing insurgent Sanders said in his speech that in a debate when turnout would be crucial, \u201cthe same old, same old will not be successful\u201d, and that the nation doesn\u2019t need \u201cmore establishment politics or establishment economics\u201d. Another Democratic presidential candidate, former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee, also appeared to refer to Clinton, telling the DNC: \u201cAfter 30 years in public service, I\u2019ve had no scandals. That\u2019s not easy in Rhode Island.\u201d Former Virginia senator Jim Webb, the remaining Democratic candidate, did not appear because he was taking his daughter to college, Wasserman Schultz said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
