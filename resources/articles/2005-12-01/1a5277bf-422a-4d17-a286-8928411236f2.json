For a substantial and growing minority, however, compulsive eating is a practice that continues all year long. What goes on inside the head of overeaters is of particular interest to Professor Victor Zammit and his colleagues at Warwick University's clinical services research institute, a formidable team working on all aspects of diet and lifestyle. \"We cover from straight science to straight medicine and everything in between. Either side of me are world experts with considerable experience in their specialist fields. There are six distinct research groupings, but we have a combined long-term aim: to come up with a strategy to control body weight and, through that, to make a major improvement to the nation's health.\" Appetite and eating patterns are controlled by the brain. \"There are lots of inputs into the hypothalamus, that part of the brain that controls main functions. One of those functions is feeding behaviour. The gut releases hormones that go to the brain, which then tells us that we are either satisfied or still hungry. With binge eaters, their brains are telling them that they want extra food when they have already consumed more than enough. With anorexics, the problem is the other way around. There are psychological factors, like stress, which affect this process. And there are some rare genetic conditions that prevent the signals from getting to the brain.\" As well as being director of the institute, Zammit is professor of metabolic biochemistry. \"I study one of the mechanisms that brain cells use to translate what's happening in the blood that surrounds them,\" he says. \"We may be able to modify the electrical signals that they send out in relation to the amount of fat, glucose and hormones within that blood.\" His team has isolated three enzymes that regulate the oxidation of fat in cells. \"We've discovered one of these enzymes is only present in the brain. Not only that, it's in those parts of the brain that we know are involved in appetite control and the setting of our internal clock. We want to find out in which neurons this brain-specific enzyme is located. And then we need to discover what happens when you change its function through drugs. That may be the key to controlling appetite.\" Being located in the Midands has ensured that Zammit and his colleagues have an ethnically diverse population on their doorstep. \"Different ethnic groups have different susceptibilities,\" he says. \"South Asians are more susceptible to diabetes than the population as a whole. African-Caribbeans have a particular tendency towards strokes and cardio-vascular problems.\" For the population as a whole, the implications of Warwick's research are immense. Needless to say, the pharmaceutical industry is taking a keen interest in what's going on at Warwick and at Coventry's Walsgrave Hospital, where much of the research takes place. \"There are similar projects going on in other parts of the world,\" Zammit concedes. \"There are already some appetite-control drugs on the market. But they're not particularly good.\" It will be a few years before the Warwick team is likely to reveal the fruits of its labours. \"It's vital that we get it absolutely right,\" says Zammit. \"We realise that this is an important issue for the whole country.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
