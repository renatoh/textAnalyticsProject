The independent group Scientists for Global Responsibility argues that government policy has \"driven a corporate agenda into the heart of universities\", undermining their openness and independence. It calls for Lord Mandelson's newly formed Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to be broken up. \"There is very obviously a trend pushing in the direction of commercialisation. It is as strong under Labour as it was under the Conservatives,\" said Stuart Parkinson, co-author of the report, Science and the Corporate Agenda. \"We have gathered extensive evidence of the damaging effects of the commercial influence. Urgent action \u2013 by government and others \u2013 is needed to resolve these problems. The trustworthiness of science and scientists is at stake.\" The report also raises concerns that commercial funding of research often results in only findings favourable to the funder being reported. It explored commercial influences on research in pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, defence, biotechnology and tobacco. In pharmaceuticals researchers found industry influence can lead to a focus on treatments for wealthier communities, rather than more common global diseases. Oil and gas industry influence \"can lead to a focus on fossil fuel-based technologies or controversial biofuels\" rather than controlling energy demand.The report chimes with concerns raised by a growing number of academics over the government's emphasis on science's role in a knowledge-based economy. Scientists and universities are worried that the recession has intensified the focus on short-term commercial benefits from science and that blue skies research will suffer as public spending gets tighter. Parkinson warned that funding constraints will also affect basic research with social and environmental goalsenvironmental research. \"Science is about establishing knowledge, understanding how things work,\" he says. \"Our understanding of issues like climate change and biodiversity is important in helping decrease our environmental impact,\" he said. He cited two instances of the government's drive to commercialise research. First, the merger this year of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills with the Department for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform to form Mandelson's BIS department. It has been criticised by academics who believe higher education should be in a department dedicated to education, not commerce. Secondly, the two most recent appointments as science minister: Lord Sainsbury and Lord Drayson. \"[They are] scientists who have made a lot of money out of the commercialisation of science and want to see this agenda pushed further forward.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
