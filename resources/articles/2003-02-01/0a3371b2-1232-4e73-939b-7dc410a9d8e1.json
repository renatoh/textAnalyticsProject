In 1951, Isaiah Berlin wrote an essay called \"Leo Tolstoy's Historical Scepticism\". Doesn't exactly grab you by the short and curlies, does it? George Weidenfeld read it and renamed it \"The Hedgehog and the Fox\", after the old proverb that the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. Now you're talking; and so, crucially, was Berlin, who, the following year, went on to give the six hour-long lectures on BBC radio that constitute the book now under review. Never before collected, they were apparently delivered virtually off the top of his head. Berlin's train of thought is a joy to follow, never dull or dry; the overall title may well be said to magnetise the attention, but the chapter headings, which are simply the names of their subjects, may not: Helv\u00e9tius, Rousseau, Fichte, Hegel, Saint-Simon and Maistre. I shall assume that you are keen on knowing what Berlin has to say about these people, but the ignoramus sitting opposite you on the tube, who has in fact been cretinised by bastard, half-baked notions of liberty, may very well not give a damn. That is unfortunate. For it is thanks to at least five of these people, argues Berlin, that the world was in such a miserable, frightened and shell-shocked state for so much of the 20th century. And the horrible paradox is that five of them went on and on about liberty, said it was a wonderful idea, the supreme good, etc. The sixth, De Maistre (as I call him), was revolted by it; and yet he has been the most marginalised thinker of the lot. I shall get back to him in a minute. How, though, can a love of liberty lead to totalitarianism and murder on an epic scale? This is what Berlin spent most of his life thinking about, and the lectures here are among the most lucid and useful he ever wrote on the subject. If you had to grab only one book of his off the shelves, you could do worse than take this one. In it, his concept of the two kinds of liberty - positive and negative - is largely taken as read, but amply illustrated. Briefly, positive liberty means utopianism, social engineering, \"equality\"; negative liberty means just being allowed to do what you want as long as you don't bother anyone else. The worst destruction in the world, said Heine, and so says Berlin, comes from the idealists: \"Kantians will appear,\" said Heine, \"who in the world of mere phenomena hold nothing sacred, and ruthlessly with sword and axe will hack through the foundations of our human life, and pull up the past by its last remaining roots. Armed Fichteans will come, whose fanatical wills neither fear nor self-interest will touch . . . A drama will be performed in Germany in contrast with which the French Revolution will seem a mere peaceful idyll.\" In 1952, Berlin did not need to gloss or add much to this horrified prophecy. Of all the thinkers considered here, it is De Maistre who will give Guardian readers the heebiest of jeebies. You may argue that it takes a certain degree of sophistry to claim that Rousseau was a proto-fascist, but with De Maistre no such fancy intellectual footwork is necessary. You hardly even need that \"proto-\". He is, though, a brilliant, compelling thinker, and as exciting to the gentle liberal as hard pornography. He tells brutal, uncomfortable truths about the human condition, and you can certainly sense Berlin's admiration amid the horror. De Maistre, if I may paraphrase his argument, or Berlin's account of it, pointed this out: why, when we meet a soldier, who kills other, blameless people in his line of work, are we polite and maybe admiring; yet when we meet a hangman, who kills only those who deserve to die (in theory at least), we recoil in disgust? \"Nevertheless,\" writes De Maistre, \"all greatness, all power, all social order depends upon the executioner; he is the terror of human society and the tie that holds it together.\" As for Rousseau's famous remark about being born free yet in chains, De Maistre's response to this is summarised thus: it is just like saying \"how strange it is that sheep, who were born carnivorous, should nevertheless everywhere be nibbling grass\". So there you go: liberty is a paradoxical business, and the search for it has led to grotesque aberrations. Berlin's work in this area has not lessened in relevance since the end of the cold war; indeed, we are always going to need it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
