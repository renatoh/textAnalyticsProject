Michael Horn, who had served as VW\u2019s US president and chief executive since 2014, was not quoted in the company\u2019s three-paragraph statement announcing his immediate exit from the firm after more than 25 years of service. VW said Horn\u2019s resignation was by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d and he would be \u201cleaving to pursue other opportunities effective immediately\u201d. The company did not explain why Horn was leaving the company now \u2013 six months after VW was caught using \u201cdefault device\u201d software to systematically cheat on US regulators\u2019 tests. Martin Winterkorn, the global CEO of VW, resigned in September 2015 in the near-immediate aftermath of the scandal, which has wiped billions of euros of VW\u2019s market value and left the company facing fines of as much as $20bn and a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice. It was revealed last week that Winterkorn was told about the illegal emissions crisis more than a year before the company admitted it to regulators. Horn has at times appeared frustrated with the German company\u2019s handling of the crisis. When he was called before the US Congress in October, he denied any prior knowledge of the software, and said its installation was not a corporate decision. \u201cI agree it\u2019s very hard to believe,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cPersonally, I struggle too.\u201d Herbert Diess, CEO of Volkswagen brand, said: \u201cI want personally to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to Michael Horn for the great work he has done for the brand and with the dealers in the United States. During his time in the US, Michael Horn built up a strong relationship with our national dealer body and showed exemplary leadership during difficult times for the brand.\u201d Horn will be replaced on an interim basis by Hinrich Woebcken, who was recently appointed head of VW in North America. A federal judge has given the company until 24 March to reach an agreement with the government on recalling the affected vehicles. Both state and federal regulators will have to sign off on any planned recall. VW has not indicated whether it will be able to meet the deadline. The \u201cdefeat device\u201d, which dramatically reduced VW diesel emissions only when cars were undergoing regulatory tests not when they were on the road, was installed in 6000,000 vehicles in the US and 11m across the world. VW has set aside \u20ac6.7bn to deal with the costs of recalling and fixing cars across the world, but penalties in the US lawsuit could cost Volkswagen more than $30,000 per vehicle, which could total as much as $20bn. Analysts have warned that the total cost of the scandal could be as high as \u20ac78bn, which would be 60% more than the Deepwater Horizon disaster cost BP."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
