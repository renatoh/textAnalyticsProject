Murder squad detectives had been hunting for Bidhya Sagar Das in the aftermath of the incident. After appealing for help in tracking down the suspect, they arrested him not far from the scene of the incident on Sunday evening. Emergency services were called to the scene in Finsbury Park in London just after 11pm on Saturday night. They found a one-year-old baby boy and a baby girl, believed to be his twin sister, with serious injuries. Both were rushed to hospital, where the boy later died. His sister remains in hospital in a critical condition. Det Ch Insp Dave Whellams, of the homicide and major crime command, said: \u201cThis is clearly a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family of the two young children. Despite the best efforts of medical professionals, a baby boy sadly died in the early hours of this morning. A baby girl currently remains in a critical condition and is receiving specialist medical care. \u201cWhilst we remain in the early stages of the investigation, a man has now been arrested. I would still like to hear from anyone who may have any information regarding this terrible incident.\u201d Mihai Manea, who lived on the second floor of the building, said the toddlers were twins who lived on the top floor. \u201cIt\u2019s really tense,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s police coming and going all the time.\u201d A woman living opposite the building where the children were found, who gave her name as Gui Gui, said she heard a woman shouting late on Saturday night and opened the window to offer help. \u201cI was watching TV,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard someone was shouting. She kept on shouting. I do not know what she was shouting. I opened the window and I asked her: \u2018Can I help you, can I call the police for you?\u2019 She said: \u2018My kids\u2019.\u201d Anyone with information can call 020 8345 3775 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
