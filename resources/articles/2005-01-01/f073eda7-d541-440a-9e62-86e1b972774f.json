There are the designers, who have turned flamboyance into a circus act: John Galliano, for instance, taking his catwalk turn in a vast pirate's hat, fully made up, and then retreating, once backstage, into a miniature VIP area the size of a four-poster bed, to which only the likes of Monica Bellucci are admitted. And the models, who are so freakishly tall and narrow that they make Gisele and her ready-to-wear comrades look like Hobbits. Not to mention the clients, my all-time favourite of whom is Astrid de Weddingen, teenage star of last year's haute couture ball in Paris, and a direct descendent of Count Dracula. I kid you not. But the real stars of couture are harder to find. Behind an anonymous door on the Rue de Faubourg Saint Denis, the only clues to what happens upstairs are a few stray black feathers on the doormat. This is Lemari\u00e9, home of some of the most highly skilled and specialised craftspeople in fashion: the plumassiers, or feather specialists. In 1900, there were more than 300 plumassiers in Paris; today, the last few in existence are based in two rooms of this atelier, or workshop. Every single feather that graces an haute couture catwalk - the maribou feathers of a Dior boa, the ostrich plumes needed for a Chanel corsage - comes from the tissue-lined brown-paper boxes that are stacked from floor to ceiling. By the window is a shop dummy wearing a coat of shaved black fur. Fran\u00e7oise, a homely looking woman of a certain age, the type one finds in department store haberdashery departments everywhere, is using fine tweezers to attach glossy black feathers to the hem. The clothes and accessories being made in the room - feather camellias for Chanel, ostrich feather corsets for Dior - will all need to be ready for haute couture catwalk shows within a few days of my visit, but the atmosphere is one of total serenity. The manic timekeeping of the designers, who will rarely commission the ateliers until days before a show, and are even then liable to change their mind several times, is discussed with a patient, nannyish indulgence. This is a stark contrast to the catwalk show venues themselves, where a fever pitch of hysteria and panic is considered de rigueur in the hours before any fashion show of note. The ambience in Lemari\u00e9 is also quite unlike almost any other modern office: although haute couture recently relaxed its stringent rules forbidding machine sewing on garments, the work done in Lemari\u00e9 and the other couture ateliers can be done using only hands and brains, so there are no machines or computers to be seen. Some of the implements used are more than 100 years old, as are some of the feathers. Increasingly, the exotic birds of paradise whose feathers are the most sought-after are protected species, so the existing stock of plumes is precious. That Lemari\u00e9 survives at all is down to Chanel. Several years ago Chanel bought it, along with four other couture ateliers that were struggling in the wake of an haute couture industry that was dwindling fast. This was not a straightforward act of charity, however: Chanel haute couture, which is central to the image, if not the bank balance, of the Chanel business, could not exist without the skills perpetuated in the ateliers. Although Chanel owns Lemari\u00e9, along with the embroiderers Lesage, the hat-makers Michel, the boot-makers Massaro and the costume jewellers Desrues, the ateliers continue to work, as they had done before, for all the couturiers, and increasingly for ready-to-wear brands. At Lemari\u00e9, for example, a room of eight \"florists\" are fulfilling the atelier's other specialism, which is in providing silk or feather flowers for hats and clothing. The head florist is 56, and has worked in the atelier for 42 years since leaving school at 14. Chanel is their major client - they have made 40,000 camellias, the house's signature corsage - but while some of the women make camellias, or bonnets made of swan feathers, for the Chanel haute couture show, others are sculpting blooms from golden emu feathers for Christian Dior or black silken rosebuds for Dolce and Gabbana. Likewise, at the hat-makers Michel, a woman making a white mink skull cap for Chanel sits alongside another moulding a zebra head for the Lion King musical. Theatrical clients, like haute couture clients, demand the technical excellence that these ateliers provide. A mile away at Lesage, an embroidery atelier which is home to 60 tonnes of beads and archives dating back to 1858, a pile of double \"c\" badges with camellia motif, embroidered in silver and gold metallic thread, are stacked between sheets of tissue on a table, waiting to be sent back to Chanel, where they will be sewn onto the pockets of ready-to-wear blazers. Twelve thousand of these badges will be made in all. Lesage, like Lemari\u00e9, now does around 80% of its work for ready-to-wear, and the rest for couture. Only Massaro, the bootmakers, makes only made-to-measure pieces. Eighty per cent of these are for private clients. Most of the small number of haute couture outfits that are produced are destined for the catwalk, rather than for sale. The embroidered outfits, in particular, are expensive even by couture standards, so in an average season, 10 embroidered haute couture dresses will be ordered in total from Lesage, of which three will be Chanel. The level of perfectionism involved in the haute couture garments is humbling. In one room, five women are working on one skirt. The first is dabbing a length of pale silk ribbon, barely three millimetres wide, with a cotton bud dipped in alcohol to lighten the colour infinitesimally; two more are sewing this in careful loops onto net to make tiny flowers, a centimetre or two wide; the rest are working on the lilac bows that form the centrepiece of the design. And then, in the next room, several more women are adding sequinned petals. What's more, the fabric, so intricately worked, will be layered three deep by the time it appears on the catwalk. The ateliers are full of quiet talents, but they are not without their larger than life characters. At Lemari\u00e9, it is the young, Vuitton briefcase-carrying creative director Eric Charles-Donatien, who has a French-American accent exactly like the wedding planner in the Steve Martin film, Father of the Bride. At Lesage it is Monsieur Lesage himself, who presides over his family business from an office crammed with thank-you letters from Christian Lacroix, signed photos of Yves Saint Laurent and snapshots of Ralph Lauren at the Lesage worktables. He is refreshingly open about how the increasing demand for embroidery in ready-to-wear saved his business - \"after 1992, we were going to hell\" - and breezily lacking in nostalgia about any supposed good old days. \"If you look at Schiaparelli from before the war, it was extremely badly made,\" he declares. Haute couture, as the most expensive branch of fashion, is often assumed to be the most snobbish. But one of the peculiar things about couture is that while great pride is taken in the skills of the atelier, and huge respect is paid to the creativity of the designers, the rich women who buy the clothes are very rarely mentioned. This is quite different from ready-to-wear, where enormous play is made of celebrity clientele, and great store set by having a brand worn by the right crowd. In the couture world, the very fabric of the dress is the thing: the women sweep their hands over the curves on a dummy like lovers, as they show off their work. What matters is not who wears a dress, or what it says in the label, but how fine are the layers of tulle, how perfect the spacing of the feathers and how artistic the embroidery. Unfortunately, such lofty ideals don't come cheap."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
