The San Francisco 11-judge panel affirmed a 2016 judgment that found no proof the classic 1971 Zeppelin song breached the copyright of Taurus, written by Randy Wolfe from a Los Angeles band called Spirit. In 2018 that ruling was overturned by a three-judge panel in San Francisco, which said certain instructions to the district court jury had been \u201cerroneous and prejudicial\u201d, and failed to clarify that the arrangement of elements in the public domain could be considered original. Led Zeppelin took the case to a larger panel whose decision on Monday, based on the 1909 Copyright Act, put the original ruling back in place. Stairway to Heaven is estimated to have grossed $3.4m during the five-year period that was at issue in the earlier civil trial. The Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page \u2013 who was sued along with the group\u2019s singer Robert Plant and another surviving bandmate, John Paul Jones \u2013 testified in 2016 that the chord sequence in question had \u201cbeen around forever\u201d. But Wolfe\u2019s trustee, Michael Skidmore, said the songs had similar chord progressions and Page may have written Stairway to Heaven after hearing Taurus while Led Zeppelin and Spirit toured together. \u201cObviously the court got it wrong,\u201d said the trustee\u2019s lawyer, Francis Malofiy. \u201cThis is a big loss for creators, those who copyright laws are meant to protect.\u201d Malofiy said he may appeal to the US supreme court. Lawyers for Led Zeppelin did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The decision in the five-year-old case was a victory for a music industry still combating fallout from a 2015 verdict that Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams\u2019 2013 hit Blurred Lines copied Marvin Gaye\u2019s 1977 hit Got To Give It Up. Jurors awarded Gaye\u2019s children $7.4m, which was later reduced to $5.3m. The singer Katy Perry is appealing against a $2.8m verdict reached last August in a copyright case over her song Dark Horse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
