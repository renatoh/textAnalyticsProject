But these souls are so sensitive that they cannot, apparently, cope with a few dozen swear words. Ken Loach - a titan of British cinema - has produced a much-lauded movie, Sweet Sixteen, about teenagers enduring the grittier sides of life in the Scottish town of Greenock. It has been acclaimed as social realism at its best. However, the British Board of Film Classification has judged the earthy language of the script unsuitable for those under 18, even if the words which trouble the BBFC are commonplace in most playgrounds. Thank goodness that our censors rest untested by Chaucer - 'cunning' was a favourite joke - or Shakespeare's references to 'country matters'. If they were to realise that 'Figo' was an Elizabethan expletive - it creeps into Henry V - they might wish to interrupt coverage of Real Madrid's matches. And what a relief that they are not required to review the sex education literature available in every school. These efforts to shield teenaged ears from an Anglo Saxon word too far would look faintly silly at any other time. Coming in the same week as a damning report from the United Nations on Britain's abject failure to protect its children, they denote a tragic irony. While we stop teenagers hearing the word 'fuck' in a cinema, we are failing the one in three children still living in poverty, the two a week who die of neglect, the thousands daily abused in the worst ways. While we baulk at teaching teenagers to put on a condom, sexually transmitted diseases - including not just gonorrhoea but HIV - are on the rise. We have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe. As we sentimentalise the innocence of our own children, 100,000 of other people's have no permanent home. Latest figures show that in the 12 months up to early 2000, 77 children were murdered, not by strangers but by abusive parents. Fourteen committed suicide in young offenders' institutions. Meanwhile, unlike a string of other more enlightened countries, we still permit smacking. It is the 'sticks and stones' of the old playground chant that we need to be tackling, and tackling aggressively. Swear words are the very least of our problems."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
