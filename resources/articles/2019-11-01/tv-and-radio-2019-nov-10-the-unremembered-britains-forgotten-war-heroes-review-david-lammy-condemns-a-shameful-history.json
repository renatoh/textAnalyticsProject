Unbeknown to many, certainly to me, this rural town near the Tanzanian border was a major military gathering point in the first world war. A war into which 2 million Africans were dragged, and 1 million died. In the beautifully tended burial ground, each British serviceman who fell in the surrounding area is commemorated with a single headstone, according to the egalitarian policy of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CGWC). Except the black Africans. The bodies of those British subjects who died for their country, then British East Africa, are not here. So where are they? \u201cYou see the bush?\u201d says caretaker Antonny Wachira Kimani, pointing to an overgrown wasteland beyond the perimeter fence. The two black men walk through the tall grasses and rubbish. \u201cThey worked together, but nobody take care of them,\u201d Kimani observes with terrible matter-of-factness. \u201cThis is apartheid,\u201d says Lammy, kneeling on the earth and clasping his hands together. \u201cI want to find out how the hell this happened.\u201d So begins The Unremembered \u2013 Britain\u2019s Forgotten War Heroes (Channel 4), a shocking documentary broadcast as we mark the centenary of the first Remembrance Sunday. Part detective story, part takedown of our selective and self-congratulatory culture of remembrance, this is the buried history of the establishment\u2019s failure to acknowledge how the racism inherent in colonial rule continues to result in a whitewashing of the past. Here is proof \u2013 in the unmarked, unnamed burial of hundreds of thousands of black African bodies killed in the war \u2013 that the only way to take pride in our collective history is to acknowledge its shame. Say sorry, and mean it. Do something. Unsurprisingly, this is not how this scandal plays out. In London, delving into the CWGC archives with professor Mich\u00e8le Barrett of Queen Mary University of London, Lammy finds out exactly how the hell this happened. Despite the CWGC\u2019s pledge to treat everyone as equal in death \u2013 \u201cWhat was done for one should be done for all\u201d \u2013 exceptions were made. Barrett unearths a 1920s document by a Maj George Evans revealing that \u201ceveryone\u201d meant white Europeans fighting on the western front. \u201cMost of the natives who have died are of a semi-savage nature and do not attach any sentiment to marking the graves of their dead,\u201d Evans observed. His conclusion? \u201cI consider the erection of individual headstones would constitute a waste of public money.\u201d A letter signing off on the plan was authored by the chairman of the then Imperial War Graves Commission, Winston Churchill. A cascade of devastating moments follows. Lammy meets a man, Mwamkono Mwavaka, whose grandfather was one of the estimated 100,000 Carrier Corps \u2013 the men, women and children recruited to transport supplies to the frontline in what was effectively a death march \u2013 who died in the war. Only the hair shaved from his head was brought home. In a vast war cemetery in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where British and enemy German soldiers are buried side by side, campaigner Kathleen Bomani breaks down as she recalls going through every single gravestone and finding not one African name. \u201cWhere do I go in my own country?\u201d she weeps. Most heartbreaking is the urban wasteland off Pugu Road in Dar es Salaam, where Barrett reckons thousands of black African carriers are buried. No names, graves, nothing. The minutes of a CWGC meeting reveal a recommendation that the area \u201cshould be allowed to revert to nature as speedily as possible\u201d. Finally, Lammy returns to London and the swish headquarters of the CWGC for a reckoning with its director general, Victoria Wallace. It may be the most grim moment of this enraging documentary, which is saying something. Wallace responds with defensiveness, recalcitrance, ignorance (\u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d she says of the racial segregation at Voi. \u201cBut do we have the names? I don\u2019t believe we do\u201d) and a fallback on the increasingly trotted out argument that we cannot judge those racist times by the standards of our own. No apology, only a cursory mention of a \u00a3500,000 cemetery for black African Carrier Corps planned for Nairobi. The CWGC has since released a statement on its website, in which it argues the interview was \u201cobfuscated\u201d. \u201cWe have seen no documentary evidence that the claims about Voi cemetery are true,\u201d it continues. \u201cIndeed our archives make no reference to African war graves in the town.\u201d One thing is for sure. This is not how the century-overdue work of making reparations looks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
