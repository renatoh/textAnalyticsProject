After almost 19 seasons and to palpable sighs of relief from forwards up and down the country, the former England defender will play for the last time tomorrow as Manchester City, their First Division championship party in full swing, welcome Portsmouth to Maine Road. Pearce is 40 next Wednesday. By then the former electrician will have had time to reflect upon a barnstorming career: from bone-crunching tackles to blistering long-range free-kicks, bludgeoned in from all angles with his hammer of a left foot; from \"that\" penalty at Italia 90 to the chest-thumping and fist-clenched celebration after exorcising his personal demon against Spain six years later. His tub-thumping presence will be missed. \"I've played with senior players over the years and you could see the hunger wasn't there, but that's not been the case with me,\" he said. \"I've had a decent career and I've enjoyed what I've done, but I always wanted to bow out with my reputation intact. There was a twang about two months ago when I thought I could maybe play on, but my missus got the right hump. She's been telling me to pack it in for about four years and she's right. \"I'm not the player now that I was 10 years ago, but I've been getting away with it. Next season, in the Premiership, I'd get hammered. I thought once that I might end up playing in my late 30s with a smile on my face, but I'm not that way inclined. Besides, I've not got the natural ability. If I have a bad game nowadays it's because I'm not physically good enough any more, and that hurts.\" His displays for City this season - there have been 42 appearances, all as committed as ever - defy that self-critique. Pearce has been awe-inspiring as Kevin Keegan's side have romped back into the Premiership at the first attempt. He has broadened his horizons by attending board meetings and liaising with players' agents, part of Keegan's pledge to introduce him slowly into the world of coaching and management. \"He's been a jewel,\" said the City manager. \"Every club needs a leader and the man's the ultimate professional. He suffered a hamstring injury at Blackburn earlier this season which would have kept most players out for a fortnight. Two days later we were all training on a freezing day, wearing bobble hats and gloves because it felt about -10, when he emerged out of the mist running with nothing on but a pair of underpants and a towel wrapped round his head. I suppose that's why they call him Psycho.\" \"I remember the lads' faces, but they were probably just thinking: 'This boy's a twat,'\" grinned Pearce. \"My non-league roots have definitely helped. I worked in a warehouse for a year after school and tried to join the police force and the army. If I'd passed either of those interviews none of this would have happened, but I ended up training to be an electrician and a fella offered me \u00a315 a week to play for Wealdstone. [The Coventry manager] Bobby Gould came in for me just six weeks after I'd finished learning my trade. Brent Council told me they'd keep my job for me just in case it didn't work out. \"But I've had the full spectrum - the adulation from playing for England as well as travelling back from Frickley Athletic on a Wednesday night at three in the morning and then getting up four hours later to wire a house. Maybe that's what endears me to supporters. I'm just one of them. If I'd written a script at the beginning of the season, this is as good a send-off as I could have had. After all, I've had a few cock-ups in my time.\" Those have mainly come on the domestic front - this will be Pearce's first championship win and there have been two FA Cup final defeats, with Nottingham Forest in 1991 and Newcastle in 1998 - but it will be for his contribution to England that he is best remembered. The first of his 78 caps came against Brazil in 1987 (1-1), the last against Poland 13 years later. England have never adequately filled the void he left behind. Along the way he endured the trauma of World Cup semi-final defeat in the infamous penalty shoot-out in Turin at Italia 90, his own personal nadir after he blazed over the bar. The miss devastated a man so patriotic that he still flies the flag of St George in his back garden. \"I blame myself because if we'd won that, I'm convinced we'd have won the final,\" he said, \"but in some respects the miss did me a massive favour. \"You can't hide from what you've done, good or bad. I used it as a spur and, the following season, scored 16 goals from left-back. I had the chance to put things right at Euro 96 [in the quarter-final penalty shootout against Spain] and, walking up to take that penalty, I felt as if the whole country was behind me.\" Pearce currently boasts 99 club goals and will take any spot-kick awarded to City tomorrow. The man's on-field emotion was encapsulated in his volcanic celebration of that Spain penalty - screaming triumphantly at the crowd, his jaw jutting, his arms pumping frantically. All adrenalin, typical Psycho. \"The nickname's fun, though it's a bit strange when you're sat in a restaurant with your wife and someone comes up, calls you 'Psycho' and expects a big roar back. I get paid to be a bit aggressive on the football pitch, not in the pub. You have to draw a line somewhere.\" \"He did all that fist-clenching and screaming for the fans before the first game of the season,\" said Keegan. \"I remember sitting with my wife after that match, and there was this little tap on the door. Stuart stuck his head round and said quietly: 'Thanks, gaffer. I'll see you on Tuesday.' My missus just turned to me and said: 'That can't be the same bloke who was ranting and raving out there.' He is really quite quiet off the field.\" His calm head could come in useful. City intend to offer Pearce a coaching role which will keep him at Maine Road, though already his name has been linked with managerial posts across the divisions. \"It wouldn't do my education any harm at all to stick around,\" Pearce said. \"This season working alongside Kevin has been fantastic, and you simply can't buy grounding like that. I want to be a manager, but it'll always be second best to actually playing. I'm going to miss all this.\" Age 39 Born Hammersmith Debut November 19 1983 Total club apps 717 Total club goals 99 (Coventry, Forest, Newcastle, West Ham, Man City) International caps 78 International goals 5 Honours League Cup 1989, 1990 \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
