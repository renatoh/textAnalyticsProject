While in Malawi, I had taken the decision to continue with my circuit of southern Africa rather than trying to fit in Tanzania and Kenya as well. The main reason for this was that I really wanted to explore Namibia properly. It sounds so completely different from anywhere else I've been: the enormous Namib desert with its towering sand dunes; Etosha National Park with its amazing wildlife and salt pans; the lonely Skeleton Coast and the spectacular gorge of the Fish River Canyon. With all this in mind, I had booked myself a three-week trip with a South African-based company called CampWild, which would take me from Victoria Falls through Botswana, Namibia and down to Cape Town. After our visit to Zambia, H and I spent a couple of days relaxing in Lilongwe before we had to go our separate ways again. Obviously neither of us were particularly happy about this and the mood was pretty miserable in the taxi out to the airport. Things didn't improve when I arrived to discover that my flight to Zimbabwe had been cancelled - and there would be no more until October. I saw H off on her London flight and then went back to have an argument with someone, anyone. This was the Easter weekend and therefore not exactly the best time to try to make new travel arrangements. The Air Zimbabawe official was on holiday, and a phone call to Harare proved fruitless. The Air Malawi official was more helpful, and she told me to come back early the next morning and she would see what she could do. I was beginning to get worried. My tour was due to leave in three days and I still needed to get from Harare to Victoria Falls. Back at the hostel in Lilongwe (a nice overland truck place called Kiboko Camp) I spent the afternoon playing bauo with the barman and trying to drown my sorrows. The next morning I was at the airport before they'd even had a chance to open the doors. The Air Malawi lady had good and bad news. I could catch a plane to Blantyre where there was an onward flight to Harare that day. Unfortunately, it was fully booked so I would have to wait and see if someone cancelled. The alternative was a crazy detour via Johannesburg which would mean spending the whole day on planes. So I flew to Blantyre and had a nervous couple of hours watching the Harare flight fill up. Then ten minutes before take-off, an official came over and told me someone hadn't arrived and I was allowed on the plane. Hooray. That afternoon I took a walk round Harare which, although quiet, seemed a pleasant, compact city. A day later I arrived in Victoria Falls and got to check my email for the first time in four weeks. There sitting on the screen was a message telling me that my Cape Town tour had been cancelled due to lack of numbers. All that hassle for nothing. I spent a little while feeling sorry for myself and then went out to come up with a plan. First of all I had a look in all the hostels hoping to find someone driving down to Nambia, but everywhere was quiet. Then I went to a very helpful travel agent in town called the Backpackers Bazaar. The people who ran the hostel I was staying in (357 Gibson Road - I recommend it) also had some good advice. By the end of the day I had lots of scribbled notes and sat down to look at my guidebook and work out the options. Basically, I could do everything I would have done on the tour by using local buses and different companies, but it was going to cost more and take a lot longer. Five months ago I wouldn't have thought twice about this, but now, with only six week left, my budget was beginning to pinch. And it wasn't just the money. For the first time, the end of my trip is beginning to loom on the horizon and I'm not at all sure how I feel about that. On the one hand it will be good to see my friends and family again. On the other, home means coming back down to earth and having to sort out a job and a place to live - none of which I have given a thought to since I arrived in Africa. But it's not all over yet. So back to my current problem. The constraints of time and money meant that something had to give, and unfortunately it had to be my visit to the Okovango Delta in Botswana. This was desperately disappointing - it's supposed to be one of the best parks in Africa - but it's just too expensive. I'll have to save it for another, wealthier time. Determined not to miss out on anything else, I took a day-trip to Chobe National Park across the border in Botswana. This involved a boat trip down the flooded Chobe River (only a tributary of the Zambezi, but still huge for all that) followed by a game drive. The day was okay and we saw plenty of lions and elephants, but there were an awful lot of tourists about. As soon as one boat or truck found an animal then all the others would flock round. I hate to think what it would have been like in high season. Tomorrow, I get on a bus that will take me down to Windhoek to begin my exploration of Namibia, but before I go I should respond to a couple of your emails. Julie asked about getting round South Africa without a car. From what I saw you shouldn't have too many problems. There's a pretty good bus network between the major places, plus there's a backpackers' option called the BazBus which I've had recommended to me again and again. They have a number of useful routes and will even pick you up at your hostel. And Mike's message about my flying to Malawi has to be the most annoying one I've received. I agree, I could have made it by bus. But anyone who's travelled in Africa knows that the buses are notoriously unpredictable. The point (which Mike seems to have missed) is that I needed to be in a certain place at a certain time to meet my girlfriend, who was flying out from London. As I hadn't seen her for four months, I thought it might be rather rude to turn up late. And I'm pleased to say that the one-hour flight was considerably more comfortable than 19 hours on the bus would have been."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
