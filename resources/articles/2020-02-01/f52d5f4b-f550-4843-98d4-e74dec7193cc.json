Electronics retailers such as JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman could see significant disruption to their supply of computers, TVs and smartphones as China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak closes the factories where electronics are made. Smartphone factories, including Foxconn, the supplier of Apple\u2019s iPhones, have already closed in China, with industry analysts predicting a 12% production slump. And Chinese tourists and international students also spend more at Australian retailers than other nationalities, meaning that the government\u2019s ongoing travel ban will also damage the sector. Felicity Emmett, senior economist at ANZ, told Guardian Australia that the city of Wuhan was a hub for electronics factories. \u201cWuhan is a high-tech centre so they are going to be producing a lot of these things that are due for export to areas like Australia. So it is entirely feasible that there are going to be areas in that sector that are going to be hit because of the lack of production. \u201cWhat we are already seeing in parts of Asia is issues with the supply chain,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that Hyundai have closed their factory in South Korea because they can\u2019t get parts out of China. \u201cOur largest import from China is telecommunications equipment \u2013 nearly $9bn worth. The next one is computers. So it\u2019s very significant. Twenty per cent of our imports from China are telecommunications or computers.\u201d Michael Blythe, chief economist from Commonwealth Bank, said the disruption could \u201ccome through very quickly\u201d. \u201cOne of the ways the disruption from this virus plays out, global production chains basically stop working,\u201d he said. \u201cElectronics are a classic example of those chains. If those factories aren\u2019t working or not working to their normal capacity you can see this disruption coming through very quickly\u201d. The experts said it was possible to see higher prices as a result, but more likely it would lead to shortages and delays for goods such as TVs and computers. \u201cIt is more likely to impact the overall supply chain,\u201d Emmett said. \u201cIt might not be that the finished good is being exported from that region. It might be that the parts can\u2019t be supplied. Particular items might not be available.\u201d Australia\u2019s shipping routes have not been particularly affected by the government\u2019s travel restrictions, according to the CEO of Ports Australia, Mike Gallacher. He said both maritime imports and exports were continuing as usual. The government\u2019s travel ban, announced on 1 February, requires any person who passes through mainland China to spend at least 14 days outside of China before entering Australia. But many cargo ships from China to Australia already take 13 or 14 days to arrive, creating only slight delays. \u201cWe can fortunately say there have been no reported major disturbances to the supply chain\u201d, Gallacher told Guardian Australia. \u201cAs an island nation with 98% of its trade coming through our ports, imports and exports must and will continue with the addition of extra safety measures.\u201d The chief executive of JB Hi-Fi, Richard Murray, told the ABC sales had not been impacted yet by the outbreak. JB Hi-Fi recorded a 9% rise in its half-year profit this week, and a 4% rise in sales. \u201cFrom a store\u2019s perspective we haven\u2019t seen any impact,\u201d he said. \u201cAcross the board the sales numbers certainly don\u2019t show it.\u201d Murray said supply issues were a possibility but \u201cwe\u2019ll start to get a better sense of suppliers in four to six weeks\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re putting a TV together and you are missing a component, it\u2019s probably not good for your production schedules,\u201d he said. \u201cLG makes the glass for the Apple watch. Many of those global brands have interrelationships.\u201d Earlier this month, the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, said the economic impact of the new coronavirus would be worse than Sars. The RBA has also previously predicted that the drought and bushfire crisis would slow growth by 0.45 percentage points this year. Emmett said that the main impact of the coronavirus would be on tourism and education. \u201cThat is the most direct hit that Australia will get,\u201d she said. \u201cOur view is that that on its own, it will take 0.5 percentage points off growth in the first quarter. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t just clear then. It is harder to quantify the broader effects \u2013 particularly the shutdown of broader parts of the Chinese economy and how that flows on to supply chains around the area. We are likely to see a hit to Korea in their growth and that will affect their demand for our goods and services.\u201d In addition, roughly 100,000 Chinese nationals with valid student visas are currently outside of Australia and cannot enter the country until the government\u2019s travel ban is lifted. Blythe said this would have a significant retail impact as well. \u201cForeign visitors, particularly from China, spend a lot of money when they are in Australia when they are in the shops,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the data shows is that Chinese tourists spend more at the retail level than any other tourist, and Chinese students spend more at the shops than any other students. \u201cAnd consumer activity has been the weakest part of the Australian economy for a number of years now. These shocks to tourism and education are playing into what is already the weakest part of the story anyway. Retail is about 30% of consumer spending, which is about 56% of economic activity in Australia. \u201cIt was only a few weeks ago we were worrying about Brexit and trade wars, and as soon as you get rid of one uncertainty, three more pop up,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
