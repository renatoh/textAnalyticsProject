For at the end of a unique day in world rugby, when all three southern hemisphere giants were felled in the space of eight hours, this victory over the world champions was more significant than those in London and Marseille. Ireland were not playing New Zealand's reserves or a shambolic South Africa team whose coach changes players as often as his socks. George Gregan's Australians are as hard-bitten as Steve Waugh's side but they were blown away on a day when the only things left dry in Dublin were the pubs. The Irish also had to turn the tide of history. In 25 games they had not beaten any of the game's superpowers. Australia had reeled off 11 successive victories against them in a run stretching back to 1979. If Ireland can suddenly discover a knack for cricket, perhaps we could even have a proper Ashes series on our hands. Of course it was the elements as well as an elemental display by the Irish pack that conspired to wash away Australia. \"We knew that at Lansdowne Road the sun was not going to be bearing down on our backs but in those conditions our skill levels let us down. We have had two games in the wet this year, the other was against the All Blacks in Christchurch, when we have struggled,\" said Australia's coach Eddie Jones. He said he was looking forward to facing England this week in more \"familiar\" conditions, in which case England supporters can start practising their rain dances. It is difficult to see the Wallabies playing as badly as this at Twickenham but they will be handicapped by Gregan travelling home for the birth of his child and back again by Wednesday, and by the loss of Owen Finegan, whose World Cup hopes are threatened after the flanker-turned-lock dislocated his shoulder after 15 minutes. There was little triumphalism in the Irish camp despite a victory that probably outranks the win that scuppered England's grand slam hopes a year ago or that over the French in Paris 18 months earlier. Brian O'Driscoll, a stand-in captain for Keith Wood, said: \"I spoke to Keith after the game and he was delighted and at least we have buried that tag of nearly-men. We nearly beat New Zealand this summer and South Africa two years ago but this will give us a lot of confidence and self-belief.\" O'Driscoll gave an immense display. In the conditions and facing the most unyielding defence in the world, the centre was not often given the chance to click into overdrive but he made some telling tackles as the Australians threatened to roar back after the break. The wing Shane Horgan also tackled anything that moved in a yellow shirt and Peter Stringer outplayed Gregan. The difference in the teams was that Ronan O'Gara kicked all six of his penalties whereas Australia were restricted to only three Matt Burke penalties. Ireland, like the Springboks in Marseille, were also given the benefit of the doubt by the video referee when Brian Campsall judged that, nine minutes after the break, Stirling Mortlock had grounded the ball only after Horgan had touched down behind his own line. Campsall had been the video referee when O'Driscoll was awarded a controversial try against France last year, so again there was a little Irish luck. But Jones, to his credit, was not carping and Ireland were worthy winners. Ireland's scrum was rock solid. Such was their strength that they did not miss the totemic Wood, who was back to club action with Harlequins yesterday and may return for Ireland's meeting with Argentina on Saturday week when O'Driscoll will be glad to hand back the armband, \"especially if I keep a 100% record as captain,\" he joked.
