In 1937, the poet and novelist William Plomer made a momentous discovery in a pile of manuscripts at the offices of Jonathan Cape in Bedford Square, where he worked as a reader. His attention was seized as soon as he started to read the contents of two bound Victorian notebooks, filled with a spiky sloping script that was difficult to decipher. They were part of the diary of a country clergyman, the Rev Robert Francis Kilvert, who had ministered to parishes on the Welsh borders and in Wiltshire before his premature death, at the age of 38, in 1879. An accompanying letter from Kilvert's nephew, T Perceval Smith, suggested that if Plomer found these specimens interesting, he might like to see a further 20 volumes containing the rest of the diary. \"Like most diaries,\" Plomer wrote later, \"it was largely trivial and of ephemeral significance, but unlike most diaries it was the work of a writer of character and sensibility.\" He undertook to edit it for publication himself. The complete text, from the first entry in January 1870, written when Kilvert was curate at Clyro in Radnorshire, to the final one in March 1879, by which time he was the incumbent of Bredwardine in Herefordshire, came to well over a million words. Plomer decided to winnow it by about two thirds. \"It simply creates that really unknown and remote period,\" he enthused to Elizabeth Bowen as he began work, drawing lines in red crayon beside paragraphs which were to be omitted. \"I showed a bit of it to Virginia [Woolf]: she was most excited. I have insisted on editing it for myself . . . But it's going to be a great deal of work, especially for some poor typist, who will probably be driven blind and mad.\" In particular, Woolf applauded the comic perfection of the scene at Kilvert's cousin Maria's funeral in Worcester cathedral where, in a sequence of brilliant descriptive strokes, the pallbearers are depicted staggering under the weight of the \"crushingly heavy\" coffin, which threatens at times to topple over and kill or maim them. Published in three volumes in 1938, 1939 and 1940, Kilvert's Diary was immediately acclaimed. As a piece of social history, it was considered to be as significant as the novels of Thomas Hardy - an exact contemporary of Kilvert's, and linked tenuously to him through their mutual friends, the Moule family - in documenting the vanishing rural life of 19th-century England; while, in certain respects, the diary appeared to run counter to perceived notions of the Victorian age. Where, for instance, was its prudery when a country parson was able to bathe naked on a public beach without suffering from any apparent inhibitions? Or when the subject of venereal disease formed part of a discussion at a ruridecanal conference? Not surprisingly, too, Kilvert's enchanting portrait of the country parish was seen as an emblem of a way of life under threat from the prospect of a Nazi invasion (Peter Alexander, Plomer's biographer, has described Plomer himself in flight from the Blitz at a house in Worthing, ensconced in the conservatory, contentedly eating mulberries with his aged father while correcting the proofs of the third volume). Kilvert's lyrical nature writing was recognised for its Wordsworthian sensibility. Kilvert had relished his connection to Wordsworth through his friendship with the Dew family of Whitney Court, overlooking the Wye. Mary Dew was related to Wordsworth's wife, Mary Hutchinson, and the subject of the Wordsworth sonnet \"To the Infant M.M.\". Kilvert's art in capturing life on the wing - that uncanny ability, as VS Pritchett noted, of his eye and ear seeming always \"to be roving over the scene and to hit upon some sight or word which is all the more decisive for having the air of accident\" - also provoked comparisons to Hopkins and Proust. \"For some time,\" Kilvert remarked in 1874, with self-conscious artistry, \"I have been trying to find the right word for the shimmering, glancing, tumbling movement of the poplar leaves in the sun and wind. It was 'dazzle'. The dazzle of the poplars.\" Kilvert's hopes that his personal record might be made public may have been distant - he was disappointed in his lifetime by his failure to publish his somewhat conventional poetry - but he harboured them all the same. He showed passages from the diary to his Oxford friend Anthony Lawson Mayhew, and perhaps, additionally, to his future wife, Elizabeth Rowland, and observed that the diary might interest and amuse \"some who come after me\". Many readers who are interested by the diary have found themselves drawn to Kilvert himself, to his humour and modesty, and to the frankness with which he writes about his susceptibility to female beauty. There are 44 passages containing descriptions of women and girls. These are sometimes emotionally overcharged and, just occasionally, give the modern reader uncomfortable pause - for example, the state of near-ecstasy in which Kilvert writes of receiving the caresses of the seven-year-old Carrie Britton. There is no doubt that this \"very sleek and glossy and gentle\" man, tall, bearded and resembling \"a nice Newfoundland dog\", had the gift of inspiring affection. However, this \"curious power of attracting\", as Kilvert himself acknowledged, could be a terrible one. He died just a fortnight after his return from honeymoon, probably from peritonitis. But it is not unlikely that his resistance to illness began to be undermined a few years earlier, in the spring of 1876, when his relationship with Ettie Meredith Brown, which had been filled with \"wild sad sweet trysts\", was brought to an end by her parents. Kilvert may have suffered a breakdown soon afterwards. We cannot be certain, as there follows an 18-month gap in the diary until the end of 1877. What we do know is that from this point Kilvert began to record presentiments of his early death, along with the details of a marked decline in his health. It was during this period that he began courting Elizabeth Rowland. Unlike Ettie, with her \"true gypsy beauty\", the future Mrs Kilvert was rather plain, but her charitable interests made her perfect for a vicar's wife. She remained devoted to Kilvert's memory, and never remarried. On her death in 1911, she was buried in Bredwardine churchyard at some distance from her late husband. Separated in life, the couple were not even destined to lie together in death. The plot next to Kilvert, intended for her, was taken by a pair of spinster sisters. Before her death, Elizabeth Kilvert removed all references to herself, and many to his ill-fated affair with Ettie, from her husband's diary. This amounted to the excision of two lengthy sequences, the first from September 1875 to March 1876, the second from June 1876 to the end of 1877; it is more than likely that she also destroyed a final part, dealing with the months leading up to their marriage in August 1879. The diary halts suddenly on March 13 1879, but since Kilvert was continuing to write poetry of a personal nature as late as the end of May (his final poem foretells that \"his songs will soon be o'er\") it is reasonable to assume that it possessed a concluding section which no longer exists. By the time Kilvert's diary came into the hands of Plomer in 1937, it had been reduced by perhaps as many as 10 volumes. But the text was to suffer still further depredations. Every diary depends for its survival on the goodwill of family, friends or executors, together with the whims of chance. The fate of Kilvert's is bound up with a peculiar combination of bad luck and the mysterious motives of one of his descendants, his niece Essex Hope. Plomer had had the commercial good sense to publish an abridged version of the diary, and the imposition of wartime paper restrictions made it unlikely in any case that the complete text could be published in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, Plomer had hopes that one day Kilvert's Diary might appear in its entirety. To his everlasting regret, though, he allowed the typescript of the full diary to go missing. Initially, this was not a matter of great concern. The original notebooks still existed, and a new text might be prepared from them. However, in 1958, Plomer learned from Essex Hope, to whom the originals had passed on the death of Perceval Smith, that she \"had done away with most of the Diary\". \"I did not scold Mrs Hope,\" Plomer wrote at the time, but he admitted later that he felt like strangling her with his own hands. Hope did preserve three of the notebooks. She presented one to Plomer himself, another to Jeremy Sandford, who had written a radio play about Kilvert, and the final one to Charles Harvey, a Kilvert enthusiast. The survival of these originals today in the National Library of Wales and Durham University Library gives one a taste of the sad, irretrievable loss caused by this wanton destruction. The appeal of several episodes in these manuscripts, absent from the edited diary, suggest furthermore that Plomer's insistence that he had published the best of the diary in his three volumes was much too confident. Why did Hope destroy the greater part of the diary that had meant so much to her uncle? She maintained that she had burned it in accordance with the wishes of Kilvert's sister Dora. Yet this was demonstrably untrue: Dora had possessed a great affection for the diary, and in old age had read regularly from it at bedtime. Hope occasionally fell back on the excuse that the writing in the diary was \"a trial to the eyes\" and \"exceedingly difficult to read\". Hope was a minor novelist of the interwar years. I Have Come Home, her novel from 1940, is set in Kilvert territory, in \"a hamlet on the banks of the Wye\", and looks back to the \"secure, spacious, colourful . . . unreal world\" of the kind that her uncle had once inhabited at Clyro. Is it possible that Hope resented Kilvert's posthumous fame so much that she destroyed not only the diary, but also his collection of local folklore, some of which she had published under her own name? Sadly, it's difficult to find copies of Kilvert in bookshops today. The one-volume abridgement, published by Penguin, and subsequently by Pimlico, has fallen out of print, while Plomer's three-volume edition has long been unavailable. To celebrate the 70th anniversary, Cape should consider authorising a critical edition of the diary, drawing on the surviving manuscripts, as well as on the background information amassed by the Kilvert Society in the years since its foundation in 1948. That way we might have the opportunity to gaze afresh on the radiant, picturesque world of the Rev Kilvert."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
