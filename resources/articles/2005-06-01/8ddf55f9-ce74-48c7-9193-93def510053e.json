Sales remain modest compared with New York or London, but these galleries are as modern, and their owners - often the wives of the country's rich businessmen - as ambitious as any in America or Britain. \"As Europe's second-most populous city - and the one with the highest concentration of billionaires on the planet - Moscow offers a large pool of potential customers,\" wrote Varoli. \"The current torrent of petro-dollars has transformed the Russian capital into a boomtown and a lucrative centre for the sale of traditional art. However, a small and growing number of buyers has now graduated to contemporary art.\" Although the first Moscow biennale in January was criticised for trying to mimic western festivals without \"offering any real opportunities to talented, local artists\", some observers believe it was \"a major boost to the contemporary scene because it attracted a new breed of young, international collectors to the city\". Commercial galleries that devote \"space to non-selling works is hardly new\", said Marc Spiegler in ArtReview (June), but the trend is now becoming increasingly commonplace. And it has little to do with curatorial urges getting the better of art dealers. Shows in which the art work is not for sale \"give the galleries a chance to connect with artists represented by other galleries, demonstrating an ability to properly handle their work - and their ego\", he explained. \"Down the road, that can pay off when the artist gets restless with his representation.\" They are also an attempt to put the gallery \"on the side of the angels in the interminable Art v Commerce struggle. Artists tend to be attracted to a gallery that seems more driven by ideas and aesthetics than buzz-building and bank balances.\" The gallery will attract collectors of artists it does not represent but whose work featured in its non-commercial shows, enabling it to promote both its own primary roster and \"secondary-market connections\", said Spiegler. In Artforum (Summer), Joe Scanlan decried \"relational aesthetics\" - art defined by the responses of the casual observer-turned-participant. \"Relational aesthetics is set out to tap the creative potential of social space,\" he said. \"But now - more than ever - social space is responsible for suppressing most of what is worthwhile about making art in the first place: narcissism; solipsism; delusion; perversion; dedication; fantasy; absurdity. And while relational aesthetics might have changed the kinds of conversations we have about art, to include questions such as what an artwork might be made of, who could be involved, or where it might begin and end, rarely have these ideas been acute enough in practice to overcome common decency. And that's a shame. Because if there's one thing we need less of in the United States right now, it's common decency.\" Artists should not be distracted by the trappings of success, particularly not by the name-dropping in Artforum.com's diary, said an aggrieved Jerry Saltz in Modern Painters (June). The constant round of parties and the attendant online gossip column \"may only be background radiation\", said Saltz, \"yet when combined with the crazed tenor of things, they're adding to a collective frustration\". \"Many artists find all this depressing and regularly disparage the carousing and ask if it's possible to get their work out without behaving in bogus ways ... Almost every artist has two lives: the outer one of career and success, and the inner one that we all got into this for in the first place, the one about work, obsession and discovery. These days the outer journey is being mistaken for the inner one. This has to change.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
