We did not have marketing support in December, unlike many of our rivals. November was an artificial high and December was an artificial low. We have a very strong new product and our job now is to introduce it to the many potential readers who will love it once they know it. A significant indication of this is that new advertisers are flocking to the magazines and we are getting devoted converts daily. The conversions are by word of mouth so it is a long uphill struggle in an extremely tough market. But quality will out. High impact news stories, intelligent, beautifully written features and our much better photographs are prevailing. Stuart Rose recently remarked that we have handled the changes skillfully, keeping the best of what was there before while confidently positioning ourselves in a much bigger broader market. He should know. There will be ups and downs - January is already up on December - but we are on a successful course. In six months time, we will have a truer picture of where we are.
