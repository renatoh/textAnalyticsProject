A target of 233 was the lowest that Morgan\u2019s trailblazing England side have failed to chase in the past four years and brought back memories of their 2017 Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by Pakistan given their struggle on a low-scoring surface. Australia come next, fresh from three successive wins that have taken them top of the Cricket World Cup table. But the England captain remains optimistic that, as occurred following the defeat by Pakistan at Trent Bridge in the second game of the tournament, a response from his players will be forthcoming. Morgan said: \u201cYou look at the basics of a run chase. Partnerships are very important and we struggled to get enough going. We had a couple of individual innings but that\u2019s not good enough to win a game. \u201cWhen we get beaten, we tend to come back quite strong \u2013 we tend to resort to aggressive, smart, positive cricket. It is now about fronting up for the next game. \u201cWe need to learn as much as we can from this match and bounce back well against Australia. We do not see this as a blow to our semi-final chances at all.\u201d Despite that assertion, England\u2019s fourth consecutive defeat by Sri Lanka in a World Cup has made their passage to the semi-finals trickier. After Australia come Virat Kohli\u2019s India \u2013 the two teams meet at Edgbaston, where away supporters are once again expected to outnumber their own \u2013 before facing an impressive New Zealand side at Chester-le-Street. All three matches will throw up fresh challenges but perhaps none like the low-slung arm of Lasith Malinga. Despite having faced the 35-year-old in 29 previous ODIs (and seven Twenty20 internationals), England continue to struggle with his angle. Jos Buttler, one of four victims of Malinga after being trapped lbw for 10, said: \u201cHe is just different. The stumps are always in play \u2013 if it hits you in line it\u2019s generally close. \u201cWe didn\u2019t counter him as well as we could but credit to a fantastic bowler.\u201d On the performance overall England\u2019s vice-captain added: \u201cI think we lacked energy with the bat. That doesn\u2019t just mean hitting fours and sixes. That means showing intensity and trying to put pressure back on the bowlers. \u201cI think we were a little bit passive as a group, which is what we haven\u2019t been for a long time. That is the most frustrating thing.\u201d It was the second match that England have been without Jason Roy and his understudy, James Vince, once again frustrated with a couple of eye-catching boundaries that were followed by a thick edge to slip off Malinga on 14. Roy, who tore a hamstring against West Indies, remains optimistic about a return at Lord\u2019s \u2013 he performed 12th man duties here \u2013 but is still due for a second scan on the injury this weekend to assess its progress. Buttler said: \u201cAs a group we didn\u2019t have that intensity. Obviously Jason is a guy who naturally does that but we can all do that from one to 11. We have played in a certain way for a long period of time and we went away from that today.\u201d Asked if Roy\u2019s absence has put England out of kilter, Morgan replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think it has at all. \u201cObviously we would love him in the side. He\u2019s a huge strength at the top of the order. But that\u2019s not why we lost the game or why we might have struggled on this wicket.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
