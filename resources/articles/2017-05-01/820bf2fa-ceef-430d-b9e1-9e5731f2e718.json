The film, which will be sold internationally during this year\u2019s Cannes film festival, will see the Oscar-winning film-maker reunite with Harvey Weinstein, who produced Moore\u2019s controversial George W Bush documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. \u201cThere is no greater part of what we can do right now than to have the power to bring Michael Moore to a mass audience,\u201d Weinstein said in a statement. He went on to say: \u201cThis movie will have one of the most innovative distribution plans ever. Now more than ever, Michael\u2019s appetite for the truth is crucial. We are ecstatic to be a part of this revolution.\u201d Named after the day that Trump was officially confirmed president, it\u2019s reportedly been in production for months. Moore has already released the one man show TrumpLand and is set to star in a Broadway show The Terms of My Surrender, also focused on the ex-reality TV star turned head of state. \u201cNo matter what you throw at him, it hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d Moore said. \u201cNo matter what is revealed, he remains standing. Facts, reality, brains cannot defeat him. Even when he commits a self-inflicted wound, he gets up the next morning and keeps going and tweeting. That all ends with this movie.\u201d Fahrenheit 9/11 made $222m worldwide and remains the highest-grossing documentary of all time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
