The president, Mateo Alemany, said the decision had been taken \"for the good of the club\". Mallorca, with only four points, are 16th in the 20-team table after Sunday's 2-0 defeat by Albacete. Pacheco was in his first term at Mallorca after a five-year spell with Boavista of Portugal, whom he guided to their first league title in 2001 and the semi-finals of last season's Uefa Cup. Mallorca, ninth in the league last season and winners of the Spanish cup, signed Pacheco after Gregorio Manzano's departure for Atletico Madrid. Ancona, the bottom team in Italy's Serie A, have appointed Nedo Sonetti, 62, in place of Leonardo Menichini, who quit after the 3-0 defeat by Roma. Promoted Ancona have taken only one point from four matches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
