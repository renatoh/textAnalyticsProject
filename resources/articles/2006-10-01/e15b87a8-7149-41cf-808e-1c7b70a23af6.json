But when her son, who has mild learning difficulties, started to struggle after the move to secondary school, she felt she had no choice but to home educate. Soon, Great Oaks school in Kent was born in her house, with registration as an independent school, after the parents' grapevine turned one traumatised ex-secondary student into five. Baker is not alone. Last week, teachers were among a group of parents given permission by Lambeth council to build their own school in West Norwood, south London. Human Scale Education (HSE), a charity committed to reforming education through small-scale learning communities, reports that the numbers of teachers and parents attending its twice-yearly how-to-set-up-a-school lectures have almost tripled in the past four years to more than 15 on the latest course. Fiona Carnie, from HSE, who is also a consultant at the Centre for Educational Innovation at the University of Sussex, says: \"These teachers and parents just want to bale out. They are disenchanted with the testing culture and spoon-feeding found in schools. By setting up for themselves, the teachers are reclaiming their professionalism.\" For others it is about the needs of their community. After the shop and pub closed in Priors Martin, Warwickshire, the headteacher and villagers were determined not to also lose their primary school when the LEA wanted to merge it with a school four miles away. Trustee Carolyn Bath says: \"The initiative came from the whole community, not just the parents. They raised the money to employ a teacher and in 1996 it reopened with one teacher and 12 students. [Former ICI chairman] Sir John Harvey Jones opened the school and gave us three years. We're still going strong after 10.\" Without state support, these new schools have to find alternative ways of raising funds. At Great Oaks, half of the students pay fees of between \u00a34,000 and \u00a34,800 a year, while the other half are funded by the LEA, giving it the status of a special school. Just two teachers provide the majority of the teaching, with specialists being brought in when needed. \"Following the national curriculum rigidly is nonsense as some students are way ahead in English and history, but are studying only entry-level maths,\" says Baker. Yellis tests run by the CEM Centre at the University of Durham provide a value-added monitoring system for years 10 and 11 that help to predict GCSE performance as well as satisfying Ofsted, while activities such as raft-building on Sandwich Bay beach, for combined design technology and environmental science lessons, help with integrated learning. The Priors school is free, after the 4th Earl Spencer gave the land and buildings to the villagers in trust for the \"free education\" of their children in the 19th century. The school raises \u00a340,000 from its biannual Priors Ball, at which 800 guests have the chance to join the country set. It could seem conventional compared with Great Oaks, with its national curriculum and Sats. However, like Great Oaks, it is not selective and classes of 15, combined with a relaxed approach to the curriculum, enable students to work at their own pace. French is taught throughout the school and integrated learning, with an emphasis on the environment, is encouraged. For Priors' parent Lara Niggle, using the school is about being part of the village community. \"Children from every part of the village are educated together for free. The kids really do grow. They're not hot-housed. It isn't PR bluff.\" For Anna in year 9, Great Oaks provides a refuge after she was bullied at previous schools, according to her mother Ann Newby, who even tried a school for behavioural problems before social services found Great Oaks. \"It's boosted her confidence as she's realised that there are other children in the same situation,\" Newby says. \"The school is like a big family and goes at her pace, and we can work with the teachers.\" The success of these two schools, whose founders felt they had to step into the independent sector to have their needs met, is clear. Great Oaks never has to advertise and now has 18 students from state and private schools as well as a rented building on Sandwich Bay. The Priors has more than 40 students, double the number when the LEA closed it, and local house prices are soaring. Not only that, they are also providing a model for developments in the state sector. Others are doing the same. Dill Green, who comes from a family of teachers, is hoping to set up a school with other parents and teachers in south London for similar reasons. \"Schools seem increasingly about childcare for a working population, not the love of learning. So we are hoping to do what state schools should be doing. Without state funding we'll have to charge fees, although we'll have a different ethos from other private schools.\" The final validation for them can only come with state funding as voluntary-aided or even trust schools. \"The legislation is in place but no school has yet been successful,\" says Carnie. \"It's too political.\" However, the local authority in Brighton is now thought to be considering one application. Teachers with their \"own\" schools up and down the country will be watching the south coast closely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
