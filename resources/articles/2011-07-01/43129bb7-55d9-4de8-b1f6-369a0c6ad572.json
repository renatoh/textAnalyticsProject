The Angel building in Islington, London, which BT vacated before the financial crash, has been shortlisted for the Stirling prize after a \u00a372m refit. The 1932 Royal Shakespeare Theatre, which has been overhauled at a cost of \u00a360m, has also been nominated. The Royal Institute of British Architects' (Riba) annual \u00a320,000 award has never been won by a refurbished building but the presence on the shortlist of two refit projects represents the emergence of austerity architecture. New buildings commissioned before the public spending squeeze also made the shortlist, including the sweeping velodrome for the 2012 Olympics designed by Hopkins Architects, and one of the most expensive city academy schools ever built, the \u00a338m Evelyn Grace Academy in Lambeth by Zaha Hadid Architects. The velodrome is the first major Olympic venue to be completed and is favourite to win with odds of 2/1 at William Hill. The Royal Shakespeare Company originally planned to demolish its 1932 listed home in Stratford-upon-Avon, designed by Elisabeth Scott, and replace it with a futuristic building by the Dutch architect Erick van Egerat. The plan was revised amid cost concerns and local objections. Instead the RSC hired Bennetts Associates to slot a new thrust stage into the main auditorium, redesign the public areas and erect a viewing tower. As well as saving money and reducing emissions, the refurb \"captured the spirits and ghosts of the theatre\", said Rab Bennetts, the architect. The Angel building was stripped back to its concrete frame and reclad as a speculative office block, shaving almost 15% off the cost of a new building and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by about a third, the designer said. \"Refurbishment saves money and reduces the environmental impact of construction,\" said Simon Allford. \"It also shows that we should be paying more attention when we design new buildings to ensuring they are capable of being adapted for future uses which we can't yet imagine.\" This month Peter Rees, chief planner for the City of London, claimed there would be fewer new skyscrapers in the current economic climate and that applications to refurbish existing office blocks had increased. He said refurbishment projects were often cheaper, more environmentally friendly and provoked fewer objections than new buildings. \"My prognosis is there will be fewer towers and that's no bad thing,\" he told Building magazine. \"There's a lot of late- [19]80s buildings that we shouldn't be throwing away.\" Also on the Stirling shortlist is An Gaelaras, an Irish language arts and cultural centre in Derry, designed by O'Donnell and Tuomey Architects. It is the first publicly funded facility of its kind since the Anglo-Irish agreement. The Folkwang art gallery in Essen, Germany, designed by former Stirling prize winner David Chipperfield, completes the line-up.\"Creative redevelopment is a strong theme in this year's list, with a major museum extension, a remodelled theatre complex and the innovative retrofit of an old office building featured, showing how even with tight planning and building constraints, talent and imagination can totally transform existing structures and sites,\" said Ruth Reed, president of the RIBA. The selection of Hadid's academy highlights an ongoing row between architects and the education secretary, Michael Gove, who scrapped a major schools building programme and complained that architects were \"creaming off cash\" from contracts. Architects reacted angrily to the claim, saying the high cost of the \u00a355bn Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme was down to wasteful procurement rather than their fees. In February Gove renewed his attack, telling a conference on free schools: \"We won't be getting Richard Rogers to design your school, we won't be getting any award-winning architects to design it, because no one in this room is here to make architects richer.\" In June the Conservatives claimed architects and landscape architects had received \u00a398m in fees to build 113 schools under BSF, with the biggest single fee being \u00a32.7m. The Department for Education said it wanted to see more standardisation in school design to cut costs, sparking fresh concern at Riba. The winner of the Stirling prize will be announced on 2 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
