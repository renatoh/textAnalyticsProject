Detectives said they are appealing for witnesses who could help with the investigation into the death of the 30-year-old in the early hours of the morning on Sunday in the Westminster area. The Metropolitan police said that officers were called to the scene by the London Ambulance Service just after 3am on Sunday to reports of a woman believed to have fallen from the third floor of Orpheus House. She was pronounced dead shortly after 3.20am. A man who was arrested at the scene in connection with the investigation was subsequently bailed to return to police on 23 April, Scotland Yard said in a statement. A post-mortem examination is yet to take place, although police have said that the death is currently being treated as suspicious. Detective Inspector Colette Smyth, from Homicide and Serious Crime Command, said: \"Even in the early hours of Sunday, Harrow Road, W10 was busy with traffic and people walking around. \"I am specifically appealing to any witnesses who may have seen the woman fall from Orpheus House, or anyone who was in the area just after 03:00hrs and witnessed this tragic incident, to contact the police.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
