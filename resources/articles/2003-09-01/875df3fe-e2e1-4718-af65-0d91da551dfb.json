Half of Europe is now in recession. In the last year France has experienced two quarters of negative growth. Growth in the euro area has gone into reverse. Japan has been in recession. Hong Kong and South Korea are now in recession, Singapore is in recession, Taiwan is in recession. And America has just come out of a recession. So because three quarters of our trade is with countries experiencing difficulties - either in or just out of recession - the British economy has been under pressure too. And so I want to thank you, the trade union movement, for your support in the difficult long term decisions we took - Bank of England independence, cutting debt, tough fiscal rules, the new deal - to ensure that here in Britain, despite the sharpest slowdown in world output growth for nearly 30 years and the unprecedented number of global, military, and financial risks and uncertainties, our country - Britain - the country that you know and I know has in the past been first in and last out of world recessions, the country that in the last 20 years suffered two of the worst recessions since the war - has not only averted recession and in quarter after quarter, year after year, in all six years of our government since 1997, continued to grow... But has now had the longest period of continuous and sustained recession-free growth for 50 years. And in these last three years it is because Britain and America have together pursued proactive, pro-growth, monetary and fiscal policies, because we have aggressively cut interest rates - by 9 times in Britain, 13 times in the USA - and, as you argued for, counter cyclical fiscal policy that we have not made the mistakes of the conservatives who by their policies that include cutting public spending would even now put Britain into recession. So despite continuing global difficulties, Britain is today on track for stronger growth with low inflation. And we will not yield to any inflationary pressures, any unaffordable demands or any short term quick fixes or soft options that would risk or squander the huge economic opportunities that our new won and hard won stability offers the British people. At the start of my period as shadow chancellor - eleven years ago in 1992 - I promised the labour movement that if we made the difficult long term decisions, we would be the first Labour government that, instead of the old stop-go and boom-bust, managed to entrench low inflation and economic stability and at the same time combine that with rising investment in our public services and policies for social justice. I can report to you now that in six years of government under Tony Blair's strong leadership because of your support inflation has been half the rate it has been under the Tories and averaged just 2.5 percent - the lowest inflation for thirty years - and at the same time we have managed the fastest improvements in spending on health and education since the war. Eleven years ago I said that, by making the right long term decisions, we could combine economic stability with social justice by delivering both low interest rates for businesses and homeowners and cutting child and pensioner poverty - and we have the lowest interest rates for nearly fifty years and there are now 1 million taken out of poverty. And in 1992 I also promised that after 100 years of campaigning a Labour government would deliver a legal national minimum wage. And we have today not only a legal minimum wage but new rights to paid holidays, the right to time off when your children are sick, the right to be a member of a trade union, and new rights against unfair dismissal, and rights for part time workers equivalent to full time workers. And I want to tell you today that the minimum wage will not only rightly rise next month to \u00a34.50; and, as the low pay commission recommended, subject to economic conditions, \u00a34.85 next year and then rising above \u00a35.00 for every hour worked; and I believe our success in delivering a minimum wage is not only a tribute to Tony Blair's premiership but also a tribute to the work of the late John Smith who told this congress ten years ago the minimum wage would be one of the first acts of a Labour government. And let me just add: soon we will to be able to report on some other unfinished business: our investigation into achieving - for the first time - for 16 and 17 year olds new rights at work too. And because poverty in work is wrong and unacceptable, I want us together to tell Britain that with the new tax credits - that means tax rates can vary from 40 per cent to minus 200 per cent: A couple with two children where one works receives not \u00a34.20 an hour, the minimum wage, but a guaranteed \u00a38.00 an hour; And a lone parent working part time receives not \u00a34.20 an hour but \u00a312.00 an hour - and I reiterate Tony Blair's pledge that our aim is that Britain, one of the worst industrialised countries for child poverty in 1997, will end child poverty in our generation so that no child in our country is left out or left behind. It is this same strength to take the tough long term decisions and to hold true to our ideals that has lain behind our determination to eradicate unemployment. In 3 years America has lost 3 million jobs, Japan has lost nearly 1.4 million jobs, Germany has lost 1.4 million jobs, but because of the policies we have agreed together - and then pursued together - including the tough obligations and responsibilities of the new deal - and despite the difficulties that concern me deeply in manufacturing and exports - the total number of additional jobs created in Britain since 1997 is one million six hundred thousand jobs. Why have we been able to keep each and every one of our economic promises for economic stability and employment? Because, friends, we have had the strength to take the tough long term decisions and not be diverted by the short term; and because we have had the courage to hold true to - and not be distracted from - our long term ideals for Britain. It is because we rejected Tory short-termist free for alls; it is because we set aside the Tory take-what-you-can, irresponsibility - and we will never shirk from that resolve; it is because we put faith in labour values of economic responsibility and refuse to yield to vested interests; it is because we insisted on building from solid foundations, looking to the long term, that, while we will never be complacent and never rest or relax in our efforts to create jobs, I can report that: \u00b7 Britain now has the lowest long term unemployment since 1976; \u00b7 The lowest female unemployment since 1975; \u00b7 The lowest male unemployment since 1974; \u00b7 More lone parents in employment than at any time in our history; \u00b7 Where there used to be 350,000 young people long term unemployed there are now just 5,000 \u00b7 Now lower unemployment than Germany, France, America and Japan; and \u00b7 More people in work in Britain today than at any time in the history of our country Remember the claim of Michael Howard - employment minister at the time of the ERM fiasco and now shadow chancellor - that the minimum wage would cost Britain a million jobs? Let me tell you. We have a minimum wage and we have not lost a million jobs. We have created a million jobs Remember his claims that the social charter would make unemployment higher than any other major industrial country? Friends by the way we have done things we have in these six years secured lower unemployment than any other major industrial country. And let me be clear that we have increased jobs not just with thousands more in the private sector but in the teeth of conservative opposition we have done so in our public services tackling decades of chronic understaffing in our health and social services, in our schools and colleges, in our caring services. And when our opponents claim these new jobs - the jobs of nurses, doctors, teachers, home helps nursery helpers care assistants - are just thousands more bureaucrats and seek to denigrate good public servants or suggest these are, somehow, second rate jobs, let us tell Britain that yes, we must have value for money and will not tolerate waste, but the thousands more we are now employing are not pen pushers doing nothing as the Tories claim. They are the: \u00b7 50,000 more nurses caring for the sick now implementing the agenda for change; \u00b7 10,000 more doctors and consultants saving lives; \u00b7 25,000 more teachers transforming our schools; \u00b7 88,000 more teaching assistants implementing the new partnership for change; \u00b7 7,000 more policemen and women protecting our streets And what some people call ancillary workers, our cleaners, caterers, porters, orderlies, clerks care assistants - I call the men and women whose care, compassion and dedication keep our schools our NHS and our caring services running, keep our public transport moving and not only ensure our public services serve the public but are making our cities, towns and neighbourhoods real communities again And we have achieved this by having the strength to take the long term decisions - and I am grateful to the directors of the privatised utilities - to raise a \u00a35bn utilities Windfall Tax to pay for our employment programmes and to put the case for 1 pence on National Insurance to pay for our National Health Service and decent public services --- and by having the courage to hold true to a long term vision where in Britain there are public services not subject to payment and charging but free at the point of need. And we will not rest or slow our efforts until we have ensured a Great Britain of greater opportunities and greater security not just for some but for all. Because it is wrong that people can be sacked by text messages - sacked without information, explanation or consultation - it is right that we sign up to the information and consultation directive and a joint framework agreed by the TUC and CBI - and we are determined to work with you and business to make it succeed. Because it is wrong that equal pay has for too long remained a promise that has not been delivered to millions of women in this country we want to work with you so that we end the unacceptable delays that prevent equal pay claims being heard for years and so secure justice now for women's pay. Because we will not accept a situation where - just because a firm goes out of business - workers can find that a pension they've saved in for all their life is worth next to nothing, I can tell you that we will set up a new statutory Pensions Protection Fund. This fund will take over the schemes of insolvent companies to ensure not only that pensions in payment are protected but that those still working can be sure of getting 90 per cent of what they were promised - for the first time guaranteeing pension protection if a company scheme goes bust. And for men and women who have served the community all their lives and deserve dignity in retirement let me also tell you that under the new pension credit from next month, pensioner couples will receive as much as \u00a319.20 extra every week - the biggest single rise in their government pensions provision ever, rewarding not penalising the small occupational pensions and savings of millions of OAPs, and as we honour, on his ninetieth birthday decades of work by someone who never retired, our friend Jack Jones, I commit this government to securing an end once and for all to pensioner poverty in our country. Because no one should see their health or safety recklessly put at risk in the workplace we will support the freedom from fear campaign and ensure greater protection for people in workplaces from factories to hospitals and shops remembering that safety at work is the mark of a civilised society. And as we use the expertise not just of the public sector but of private firms that is making possible the biggest construction programme in our history for hospitals, schools and transport we will also continue to tackle two tierism in the labour force and we are ready to continue to discuss directly with union memberships the way forward as we seek justice for every employee. And friends ...we have even greater more dramatic challenges ahead. To meet and master the huge competitive changes of globalisation we must demonstrate the same strength to take the tough long term decisions, the same courage - in the teeth of opposition and testing times - to hold true to our long term ideals. Because globalisation can be managed well or badly, can bring social justice or economic exclusion, my goal - Labour's goal - is that Britain can lead in the new global era as the first economy to combine a full employment enterprise economy with a fair society founded on free public services based on need not ability to pay. I want us to demonstrate that even in a highly competitive global economy Britain can combine modern industrial strength and the removal of child and pensioner poverty. I want us to lead showing that even in the fast moving competitive global economy Britain can secure at one and the same time economic efficiency and a free and modernised health service - yes with modernised, reformed hospitals where there is tough inspection and extra freedoms for high performers - that is the best insurance policy in the world. I want us to lead, for it matters not just to us but to developing countries - who know that without free education and free health care millions are condemned to poverty - and show that in a global economy countries of strength and vision can ensure enterprise and social justice advancing together. And I propose today that we agree to work together - British workforces, British managers, and the British government - so that building on the 1.6 million jobs we have already created we can restore fully the 1944 objectives of high and stable levels of growth and employment, to create in this country - even while unemployment has risen in France, Germany, Japan and America - not just full employment for one year, but full employment on a sustained basis, not just in one region but in every region and nation of our country. And to achieve full employment and fund our public services there is not only no escape from demanding efficiency enterprise and value for money but we must have the discipline to together address, tackle and overcome the old British problems of under-investment, low productivity and inflexibility, inadequate skills, poor management, poor levels of enterprise and industrial relations and restrictive practices wherever they exist -- and use this time of opportunity our new stability has given to remove all the old barriers to productivity, enterprise and full employment. So I want to spell out to you the gains to us as a labour movement and the possibilities, yes duties, we will have to discuss and discharge together. And I can tell you the responsibilities we accept as a Labour government: We will have the strength to take the long term decisions not just to entrench the economic stability but, with a pro industry and pro enterprise policy, to build modern manufacturing and industrial strength. I tell you now that in my Pre-Budget report and my forthcoming Budget I accept the responsibility to do everything I can to ensure that it is Britain, the first great industrial power, that can lead again in the global economy with, instead of the old short-termism, the best support - as Patricia Hewitt and Charles Clarke have said - for innovation, for science, and R and D for manufacturing and industry. It is my responsibility to ensure it is Britain that leads in the global economy with, instead of small firms overcharged when they borrow and hit by late payments from large firms, the best encouragement - such as our reforms in Capital Gains Tax - for enterprise, entrepreneurs and the small businesses that will, in future, employ the largest number of additional workers. To ensure that it is Britain that, building the best employment service in the world, says to the unemployed - when Andrew Smith and I demand of you not to stay unemployed but to take one of the 600,000 vacancies now on offer, we will do everything we can - training, advice, information, help with transport and equipment - to be on your side. And to ensure that it is Britain in the global economy that, instead of regionally unbalanced economic growth and inadequate transport infrastructure, leads again with - as John Prescott and Alistair Darling propose - Regional Development Agencies offering the best regional incentives and support for manufacturing and industry. And so yes, the answer to the questions this morning about manufacturing is that - as we have seen with shipbuilding winning new aircraft carrier orders - it is possible for us to work together to invest, create and build, for Britain, modern manufacturing strength. And with our policy of leading in Europe we will show, as Tony Blair and Jack Straw have said today, Britain's national interest with half our trade with Europe is best advanced as active partners in Europe; we will demonstrate the benefits of the euro if we can achieve sustainable and durable convergence with the euro area; and we will take on anti-European prejudice and myths to show how we can unite Britain around a pro-European consensus. Just as internationally we will continue to back our leader Tony Blair in his efforts today to bring security and reconstruction to Iraq and to work with our allies to tackle the evil of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons proliferation around the world. And I want you to work with us not just to support the modern industries, enterprise and wealth creation we need for full employment but the modern skills: for today the skills of our members are the not just the most important means of production and the commanding heights of our economy, they are also the key to job prospects, career opportunities, future standards of living and individual opportunity for millions. So let us salute - in each of our unions - today's trade union pioneers of the new skills revolution - the 6,500 men and women who are trade union learning representatives rightly bargaining for skills, the 36,000 gaining qualifications in 180 trade union learning centres, nearly 1 million workers succeeding in learn direct and the skills for life programme, and the employer training pilots which are breaking with the old failed voluntarism of the past and ensuring that in return for time off, workers have the financial support to obtain the new skills they want and need. And because this is only the start we want to work with you to seize the opportunity so that - supported by more finance from the Trades Union Learning Fund - trades unions are at the centre of hundreds more learning centres, can pioneer trade union colleges and even trade union universities, and can lead and drive forward the skills and training revolution at work - tackling what Digby Jones rightly calls the scandal of the 7 million adults without basic skills, so that just as in our schools and universities - where I ask you to support modern and reformed systems of funding, opportunities and chances once available only to the few can be open to every union member, every worker in every workplace in Britain. And we want to work with you so that workers can benefit from the next major challenge a modern global Britain must meet: because, in the absence of proper child care, it is wrong that mothers and fathers struggle to balance work and family life, we want to work with you - building from improved maternity, paternity pay, nursery education for all and Sure Start and Children's Centres, something this movement has fought to achieve for years: at the centre of our economic policy the first national child care strategy for Britain. But let me make it clear: as long as I am chancellor there will be no return to the mistakes that past Labour and Conservative governments made of attempting quick fixes, gambling with our stability and failing to modernise our public services. Trust is built from demonstrating the strength to take the long term decisions and demonstrating the courage to hold true to your long term vision. Just as there will be no return to the monetarist economics, arbitrary public spending cuts and privatisations of the Conservative past and no retreat from our vision of a full employment, enterprise Britain and public services free at the point of need, I tell you honestly: there can be no return to inflationary pay rises, no return to loss making subsidies that prevent the best long term decisions for Britain, no resort to legislation from Europe or elsewhere that would risk jobs, no retreat from a pro enterprise pro industry agenda and no retreat from demanding efficiency and value for money as well as equity as we renew and reform each of our public services. And it is by a continued commitment to long term stability and discipline that we will be able to have growth in spending in the next round and it is our determination to deliver world class public services that means we will offer growth in spending only where we secure value for money, cut back on central bureaucracy, move resources to the front line first matching resources to reforms - and today we start with the Lyons' report - setting out proposals that could relocate 20,000 government posts out of Whitehall into the regions and contribute to our plans for full employment for all the regions and nations of the country. And while we know that there are issues - real issues which divide us in the debate about the reform of public services - it is because we are all committed to one aim - world class public services - that we should resolve to work together to settle these issues not through headlines and conflict but through dialogue and discussion. A Britain of full employment, high productivity modern manufacturing strength and world class public services. A vision for Britain that recognises that what unites us is not just a constitution or a rule book or sentiment or simply historical association but common beliefs shared by this Congress and the British people - values that demand dignity of labour, social justice and the right of not just some but all to opportunity and security. So let us never forget the lesson that this labour movement has understood for one hundred years, the lessons we have learned from our successes and from our failures, that the foundation of all we do, the rock on which we build, the precondition for what we achieve, and the basis of long term trust is our ability: \u00b7 To secure economic stability and progress \u00b7 To make possible rising employment \u00b7 To create economic prosperity not just for some but for all. And six years into this government I am more confident than ever that building on the strong economic foundations we have been creating together we can, with continued discipline, not only create full employment but, under a Labour government: \u00b7 Eradicate child poverty \u00b7 Extend educational opportunity for all \u00b7 Ensure all pensioners dignity in retirement \u00b7 Meet our responsibilities to the poor of the world; and \u00b7 Build prosperity not for some but for all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
