Could it be a box of powdered cappuccino sachets? Or a large porcelain ornament frog complete with sticky yellow frogspawn? Tattoo sleeves, like tights for the arms - so you can slip them on if you want to look a bit hard or hipster? Does it matter if it doesn\u2019t in any way match your skin colour? How about a bottle of Domestos bleach? Yes, really. Or a bag of used-only-once cotton socks? Washed, mind. These are all contenders, as I discovered last year when I got together with a group of friends on 28 December. As well as catching up over a few drinks, the request was to bring some of the most bizarre, awful, jaw-droppingly tasteless, or embarrassing gifts received during the festive season. We laughed long and hard at these items. Cynical and ungrateful? Only perhaps, but these extraordinary items of misfiring (un)generosity expose how Christmas can be a season of blind panic, peer pressure and terrible judgment. So what is the best gift you can receive? Perhaps it\u2019s the one you choose for yourself. So this week, with shopping having reached the peak of a frenzy, not unlike, in my experience this week, the zombies who return, by memory and instinct, to the mall in George A Romero\u2019s 1978 film Dawn of the Dead, it\u2019s time to return to real life with songs all about gifts, presents and giving. So many talented musicians, from Aretha Franklin have described their ability as being \u201ca gift from God\u201d (although Joni Mitchell said her own \u201cgift for music was borne out of tragedy and loss\u201d). These kinds of gifts, including your time, skill and love, also count alongside actual items given or received, but let\u2019s abstain from more abstract terms such as gift of the gab or god\u2019s gift to women. Back to Christmas. One of best ways to relax, I always felt, was to put one\u2019s feet up, with a cup of tea and a biscuit, and peruse the latest Argos catalogue. Known to most British shoppers as classic, colourful tome of bargain consumerism, and a near-miracle of mass compilation, in this substantial volume you could make an inner fantasy journey to imagine owning almost anything through the power of glorious page-flipping glossy analogue. Or you used to, until they turned it now mostly into a website-only version, even in stores. That\u2019s technology for you. Bah humbug. Yet technology, of course, is our friend. And this year I\u2019ve been looking at, and even snapping up a few items for the ever so subtle music-loving, guitar--and-keyboard-playing cyclist that I am. But who then among us in the RR Aladdin\u2019s Cave fraternity doesn\u2019t fantasise about many a rare record played on a VPI Prime turntable, an unaffordable top-notch sound system or headphones, or even a beautifully hand-made wooden and metal instrument from the likes of Gretsch, Gibson Les Paul or Nord? Here ends the list. But one thing I have discovered recently is the joy of the Bluetooth speaker, handy for seamlessly transmitting music to any room in the house from your phone or tablet. Some can be quite pricey, and others more affordable, but the sound is often impressive. But Christmas is really all about absolutely useless presents. Many can be found in so-called \u201cinnovations\u201d catalogues in which every kind of item can be purchased to apparently increase the practical comfort of you your home, but, by a far greater degree, drastically reduce every aesthetic look. Mini step ladder or ramp so your dog can climb on the bed? Sold! Horrible baggy beige trousers with Velcro or zip sections to quickly convert them into shorts? Yours, sir! Some kind of wraparound vibrating electrical thingy that makes you think you can lose belly fat without doing anything other than switch on and watch it wobble? Kerching! But the greatest useful/useless items and ultimate expression of multi-tasking modern life is the Japanese chindogu. These gloriously designed items, illustrated above and below, range from walking-stick chinrest or wall-suction helmet to help you sleep on long commuter journeys, mini umbrellas to keep your shoes dry, mop slippers for a cat or baby to clean the floor on the move, an electric fan on a chopstick to cool your hot noodles, the messy noodle eater\u2019s hair guard, a toilet roll hat for allergy sufferers, the umbrella tie and butter stick pen. Every home should have some. This week\u2019s guard of all gifts and president of presents is our own far-north Father Christmas - RR\u2019s fabulous Fuel, who will help bring in a merry yuletide. Present your musical gifts under the virtual tree in comments below, or optionally in the Spotify sack by last orders 11pm UK time this Monday 28 December for results on Thursday 31 December. Of course we all know the greatest gift is the sharing and receiving of music. Now then, I know a good place for that. May we all get what we deserve. And as Noddy Holder would say in some rare number, now forgotten, and never played: Merry Xmas, everybody.
