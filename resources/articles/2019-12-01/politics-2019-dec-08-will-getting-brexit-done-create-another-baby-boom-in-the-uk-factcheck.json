Background In an interview with the Sunday Times, the prime minister claimed that \u201cCupid\u2019s darts will fly once we get Brexit done\u201d and \u201cromance will bloom across the whole nation\u201d. He said there had been a baby boom \u201cafter the Olympics, as I correctly prophesied in a speech in 2012\u201d. Johnson is fond of such claims. When mayor of London, he claimed the \u201ceuphoria\u201d in the wake of Team GB\u2019s success at the 2012 Olympic games had led to a surge in births not seen in the capital since 1967, the year after England won the football World Cup. Reality Across the UK, the number of babies born in 2013 was down on 2012, so no Olympic baby boom there, according to the Office for National Statistics. ONS tables for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland showed there were 812,970 babies born in 2012, the year of the games. The following year \u2013 when Johnson\u2019s supposed baby boom would have materialised \u2013 the numbers were slightly down to 778,805 in 2013. So the \u201cparoxyms of joy\u201d that Johnson spoke of after Team GB\u2019s gold medal haul did not lead to a baby boom. In London, the ONS also show a small drop in births \u2013 from 134,186 recorded for 2012 to 128,332 for 2013. But there was a lot of talk about a baby boom in 2013. One consultant clinical psychologist was so excited, she explained that a national sense of optimism can act as an aphrodisiac. \u201cWhen you experience feelings of novelty, interest and motivation your brain releases dopamine and noradrenaline, which in turn increase levels of oxytocin and vasopressin \u2013 chemicals associated with arousal. On a neurobiological level, the Olympic baby boom makes sense.\u201d Notwithstanding the absence of such a boom, hopes that Brexit will cause such a leap in dopamine levels seem like a stretch. Verdict There was no baby boom in the year after the Olympics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
