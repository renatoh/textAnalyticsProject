It was, as always, awful but not as awful with all of you here. Come back next week so we can gawp at the final 10, whittling themselves down like contestants for the Darwin Awards. Hooray! I\u2019m @jnraeside on Twitter if you want some sort of counselling in the meantime. Next week\u2019s throw-forward sees Alan utter the immortal, \u201cI\u2019m cranking up the action now\u201d which means he\u2019s probably going to let rip a feisty guff and then challenge the contestants not to mention it, mid-boardroom next week. So we can all look forward to that. April, Elle and Mergim have all found a satisfactory justification for their firings which enable them to get up and start again tomorrow. From 13 to 10, the cull is complete. April is next to get zapped. Three firings in one episode. Is that the big reveal? Crikey. David quivers and shakes as Alan ponders his fate. He is finally sent back to the house but the others are booking a triple Uber to hell. Alan tries to soft soap it, but he\u2019s kicking Mergim\u2019s arse to the curb. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay in touch,\u201d he adds uncharacteristically in a way that makes my tongue feel furry. April is still talking and accuses Mergim of being immature. He plays the refugee card for the second time this episode. I\u2019m not sure whether Alan will go for it or not. Which way is the wind blowing? Right, so David fugged up some measurements briefly but came good in the end. April, on the other hand, is doing what Alan hates which is trying to blend into the background. Her self defence speech mentions something vague about \u201cgetting her hands dirty\u201d but he doesn\u2019t seem swayed. Mergim is the guy he usually keeps in for a good long time just for the chutzpah alone. So it\u2019s Mergim, April and... it\u2019ll come to me. Is is David??!!! Somehow, Charleine misses Mergim\u2019s panic decision and is sent back to the house but Alan doesn\u2019t let her speak to thank him. Mergim brings back April (for no reason at all) and a man whose name I literally cannot remember. Mergim looks quite scared because now it\u2019s up to him. Elle was literally so lame - and this is in the context of a bunch of Apprentice numpties - that she didn\u2019t even make it to the final execution. It\u2019s like Henry VIII handed Ann Boleyn the axe and just told her to cock off to a ditch and cut off her own head because he couldn\u2019t be bothered. Alan waves his usually doom-mongering finger and places it upon Joseph\u2019s brow. Her verbally forbids Elle from bringing Joseph back. And what\u2019s more, he fires Elle without recourse to due process. I told you not to get your hopes up. It\u2019s not exactly a major narrative twist. But who else will go? Mergim is the first to fight for his life but he can\u2019t defend why he charged so little to clean corporate windows. Everyone tonight just grabbed prices out of the air because none of them are able to charge proper money for something they can\u2019t do. What did Alan expect? They can\u2019t do useful things. He doesn\u2019t want an artisanal craftsperson, he wants a paper juggler. What is he on about? In the sad cafe, Elle pointlessly tries to decide who to bring back, like a terminally ill woman trying to decide who to shoot with the last of her energy as she travels towards the bright light. The prize for the winners is a visit to a Russian spa. No idea why it is specifically Russian but the whole \u201cbush in face\u201d modus operandi appears to be a thing. Have a massage but if you have a massage with a load of tree in your mush, it\u2019s Russian. Versatile \u00a3530.01 profit Connexus \u00a31,050.08 profit So the cursed team finally win a task. Brett and his grateful minions make their exit and Elle thinks about all the different ways she can thank Alan for the opportunity. Selina detonates a depth charge under Brett by undermining his decision to make her scrape chewing gum off the terraces. Vana tries to push her market research and Alan scoffs like she\u2019s talking Martian. Alan says Sam would probably have preferred to be at Stratford-upon-Avon rather than Stratford, east London. Why, because he loves Shakespeare and wants him to be his boyfriend? April\u2019s power bun is taller than the Shard. How did she get it up there? It has clouds around it and a little light flashing on the top so planes don\u2019t crash into her. \u201cI laid on two big jobs,\u201d says Alan, almost challenging the candidates to laugh at his use of ambiguous language. Elle tries a new tactic by actually hurling congratulations at Joseph for pulling her arse out of the fire. Alan bangs on about his \u201ccomplete all-rounder\u2019 status and goes straight for Elle and her leaflet cock-up. \u201cI designed my own flyers,\u201d says Mergim but Alan isn\u2019t impressed. So from all the pre-publicity we\u2019ve been lead to believe that tonight\u2019s boardroom is like WAY rad and off the hook. What do you think Alan is building in there, behind the frosted glass? \u201cI\u2019ve shown my leadership, squeaks Brett as his team\u2019s fee is knocked down and down. Elle\u2019s team try to charge their last client more and she flat-out tells them to do one. It\u2019s the final, desperate flurry of the day and everyone is losing the plot. \u201cThere\u2019s too many weeds,\u201d yells someone. \u201cToo much bush,\u201d replies another. It\u2019s 6.30pm, guys. It\u2019s over. Brett realises that his team won\u2019t have time to finish gussying up the football stadium. Elle\u2019s lot crappily paint the floor in the last room in the theatre and convince themselves that it\u2019s all good. Not one of these bozos has delivered what they promised. This is The Apprentice, whatever the indicators, novice Elle is going to poo all over experienced Brett isn\u2019t he? I hate the producers because they ALWAYS get this right. Darn them. In Islington, Mergim cocks up yet another job and his sub-team has to hand some money back due to damage caused. To be fair, the final result of the garden make-over is impressive. They\u2019ve cleaned up. I can\u2019t fault them. Another blue sky moment - I think Richard and Brett are the same person. I cannot differentiate no matter how hard I try. Back in Rachel\u2019s garden, Vana levels with the client and says they can\u2019t re-design her garden in one day. They promised her the Eden project but what she\u2019ll actually get is some leaves swept up. Claude makes a point of noticing Vana\u2019s realism. So she\u2019s staying. \u201cElle\u2019s the project manager but you wouldn\u2019t know it,\u201d says Karrrren. If she doesn\u2019t verbally rugby tackle Elle to the floor during the boardroom evisceration and flick her earlobes with criticism, my name\u2019s not Julia Raeside. And it is. Brett\u2019s team have won the football business and are going at the terraces with a power wash. The boys soak the concrete and then Selina whines that all the chewing gum is too soggy to chip off afterwards. This is a metaphor for men and women, no? Not really sure how but if someone with more time could join the dots for me, that would be super. Elle furthers her cause when the corporate client calls back and flaps like a beached stingray. \u201cI have no experience of negotiation,\u201d she whimpers, her eyes going like massive saucers as the boys step in to rescue her. You\u2019re a disgrace to all businesswomen, Elle. Romi and Michelle do NOT think you should order the businesswomen\u2019s lunch the next time you go for an executive toastie. I think Gary has just called one of his mates and offered to clean up her garden. Vana and Scott accompany him and the three of them launch into a full garden landscaping pitch which involves him bulldozing her entire house and chucking down some crazy paving where her kitchen used to be. They have three minutes to achieve this. Go, Scott. Elle arrives at the Stratford theatre with her team. Joseph is a \u201cplumber\u201d apparently and offers his expert opinion. Karrrren has just informed me that Elle actually does work in construction but I have to agree with K-face. I haven\u2019t seen a single sign that Elle knows what the heck she\u2019s doing. Elle is going if her team loses. I mean, the flyer thing was bad. But she is not on top of this at all. Brett\u2019s team quote for the football club and offer them a price which is \u00a320 less than the other team. They\u2019re all as stupid as one another. April - hi again April - is casting doubt on the sub-team leader and trying to tout her team\u2019s services for buttons. Do any of them have a clue about this stuff? Mergim merrily \u201cscrews in a nail\u201d and says the shelves are \u201cmeant to lean to one side\u201d like all shelves. Don\u2019t tell me YOUR shelves are horizontal. If shelves were meant to be level, god would have sent us an invention to make that easier to judge. Mergim, Charleine and their sub-team are cleaning windows and think they\u2019re amazing. Look at us cleaning windows. The windows start off dirty and then we chuck water at the glass bit and wave our hands around and LOOK. We cleaned the windows. The queue of angry tradespeople containing children\u2019s authors and pet product salespeople adds some window cleaners to their number. Firstly, they have corporate clients to please. Then they can shill their meagre wares to all and sundry. Both teams quote to do up the costume department at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, east London. Brett\u2019s team are measuring and sounding like they have seen wood before. I\u2019m impressed. Brett quotes confidently and tells the client that is he all, like, well professsional and things. Elle\u2019s team start with a south London football club. DHFC? They want their seats cleaned and their white lines re-painted. David pulls the figure of \u00a3500 literally out of his butt cheeks. No one knows what to do afterwards so they all just stand there. We have our answer. Elle\u2019s team have missed their deadline for printing flyers so they have no marketing material. At all. None. Mergim suggests putting creepy notes through individual front doors. Brett seems to have a massive advantage here. Either producers don\u2019t want a fair fight this week and are setting Elle\u2019s team up for a gigantic Buster Keaton-style fall. OR they know Brett is all gob and they\u2019re setting him up for the whole shooting match to cave in on him. Brett the builder is given the PM job and he\u2019s visibly delighted. I had no idea that was his name. I suppose Butler-Smythe is a nom de plume. Elle is also shoved into the PM role and looks thrilled. Her team are completely clueless about building things. \u201cSimplicity is key here,\u201d she says to them as they nod cluelessly. Mergim has been \u201cdying for it\u201d as she gives him a team leader role. His sub-team will be cleaning windows. I think. It\u2019s 5.30am as per and the corporate weevils throw on their steel toe-cap boots and high vis street wear in readiness for the DIY task. Please, Alan, arm them all with nail guns and let the Pacific Heights hijinks begin. Instead of people carriers, the teams are met with white vans. Let\u2019s call them tool boxes, because that\u2019s what they\u2019ll be carrying. I bet I\u2019ve just stolen Alan\u2019s thunder there. That\u2019s one of his zingers neutralised right there. Before we continue, everybody high five for making it to the halfway point without bottling it. We are the hardcore. We are the post-bomb cockroaches of the reality TV world. Need we really relive the children\u2019s book task? I\u2019m sad to say, several of my friends made a beeline to GOSH comics in Soho following last week\u2019s episode and bought the children\u2019s books the two teams made. What they plan to do with now is anyone\u2019s guess but I imagine they\u2019ll be handy if they run out of bog roll. A quarter OF a million pound investment is at stake, no matter what the narrator says. I had previously missed Selina\u2019s (checking the chart) sniffy \u201cPedestrians, out of the way,\u201d from the recap. Oh, she\u2019s endearing herself to us beautifully. Is now a good time to admit I still haven\u2019t learned the candidates\u2019 names and I have to refer to my week 1 chart every time someone says something risible so I can credit them with it? A War and Peace trailer, there. Should be the subtitle for The Apprentice. It lasts about as long. \u201cYou can never un-see it,\u201d says Reece Shearsmith in that Dr Who trailer. Should be the tagline for The Apprentice. avenueman has introduced the topic of what to call a collection of Apprentice candidates. His suggestion of \u201ca thicket\u201d is superb. Any others? I\u2019d just like to leave this here for you all. I think it might qualify as a sonnet. I think this person may be our new leader. Tonight, the dullards must run a handyperson business. (This is the Guardian - the software literally won\u2019t let me type the gender specific old-fashioned term for it.) And rumours are rife that Alan is going to do something quite off-book during tonight\u2019s boardroom session. Seeing as how Al\u2019s version of \u201creally mixing things up\u201d is to put a boy in the girl\u2019s team and so on, this will probably be on a par with Julian Fellowes suddenly detonating Lord Crawley\u2019s head at the dinner table, only for him to be quite all right again a few minutes later. Don\u2019t get your hopes up. Join me here just before 9pm in protective clothing and we\u2019ll literally watch paint dry together."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
