Tonight's Timeshift traces the changing role of supermarkets in Britain - a story that's guaranteed to get everyone reminiscing about the good old days of the local greengrocer before piling into the people carrier to spend hours wandering around in the fluorescent daze of the new hyperstore. Yes, you can get avocados and limes 24 hours a day, but what have we lost? Modern Times follows at 9.40pm, with a look at the journey a mange-tout pea pod takes to get from a Zimbabwean farm to a London dinner party. Richard Vine Films Liar Liar (Tom Shadyac, 1997) 9pm, ITV2 Workaholic lawyer Jim Carrey misses son's fifth birthday and as compensation has to obey the boy's special wish: that Dad will tell the truth for 24 hours. Not easy in the legal business, of course, as the squirming comic's dopey-faced antics make abundantly clear. Scenes in which he insults his bosses and is a little too honest in representing sexy divorcee Meg Tilly, are perfect showcases for Carrey's eye-popping sense of humour. Timeline (Richard Donner, 2003) 10.15pm, Sky Movies 2 Archaeologist Billy Connolly is hard at work in the Dordogne when he is suddenly whisked back to the 14th century. His valiant son (Paul Walker) and fellow students set off on a quest to bring him back, and get embroiled in standard medieval swords and stuff, involving the likes of Lady Anna Friel. So it's really a swashbuckler with a bit of pointless sci-fi thrown in. Maybe we should blame Michael Crichton, on whose iffy novel this is based. XX/XY (Austin Chick, 2002) 11.35pm, Sky Movies 1 It's hip, early-90s New York and animator Coles (Mark Ruffalo) meets student flatmates Sam (Maya Stange) and Thea (Kathleen Robertson). Before you can say menage-a-trois, they're off to bed together, but it's not quite the wild experience they anticipated. But jumping forward 10 years, the trio meet up again, and we find that they never quite got over that earlier affair, which is bad news for Coles' latest girlfriend Claire (Petra Wright). It's an intriguing tale of needy people, ably handled by debut director/ screenwriter Chick. Flesh &amp; Blood (Paul Verhoeven, 1985) 11.35pm, Sky Cinema 1 More medieval mayhem. There's plenty of flesh and blood in Verhoeven's rough-and-ready US debut feature, an adventure packed with combat, pillage, rape and plague. At a stretch you might see in the full-blooded fight scenes hints of the future Robocop and Starship Troopers; but it's only a middling middle-ages epic, with a young Rutger Hauer leaping about like a meaner Robin Hood, leader of a mercenary band whose kidnap of wealthy young Jennifer Jason Leigh leads to violent retribution.
