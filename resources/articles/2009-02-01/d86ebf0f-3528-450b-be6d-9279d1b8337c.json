The report, by the International Commission of Jurists, expresses \"deep concern\" over the findings of changes to the legal landscape since September 11 in more than 40 countries including the UK, the US, and countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Singling out the UK's use of a wide range of counterterrorism laws, the report highlights allegations of complicity in torture and intelligence sharing, the practice of rendition, and the system of control orders, as areas of particular concern. \"We have been shocked by the extent of the damage done over the past seven years by excessive or abusive counterterrorism measures,\" said Justice Arthur Chaskalson, former president of the South African constitutional court, who headed the study. The report comes as the case of Binyam Mohamed continues to draw attention to the role of the UK intelligence services in questioning detainees alleged to have been tortured in Pakistan and Guant\u00e1namo Bay. \"UK security services facilitated in various ways the questioning of Binyam Mohamed in Pakistan and the US detention, while being held incommunicado and subjected to ill-treatment,\" the report says. \"The relationship between the UK government and the US authorities was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing.\" The report also comes as former senior law lord, Lord Bingham, writes in tomorrow's Guardian that the UK government has taken \"tough repressive measures\" including the laws for indefinite detention of foreign nationals without charge, and the failed proposals for 42 days detention without charge. \"The government's ill-judged and ill-fated attempts to detain terror suspects ... [were] pills which parliament declined to swallow,\" Lord Bingham writes. However, a number of oppressive measures continue to present a threat to the rule of law in the UK, according to the report. The include rendition \u2013 the practice of seizing and transferring terrorist suspects \u2013 described as a measure which \"violates numerous human rights\". \"It was clear to the panel that the practice of rendition and extraordinary rendition ... involved a 'spider's web' of cooperative endeavours,\" the report states. \"Many states have allegedly facilitated extraordinary renditions including ... the UK\". The report also points to the system of control orders, developed by the UK and copied by other countries including Canada, and described in damning terms as \"missing ... many important safeguards\" and raising \"concerns about real and perceived discrimination\". \"Seven years after 9/11 it is time to take stock and to repeal abusive laws and policies enacted in recent years,\" said the former president of Ireland and president of the commission, Mary Robinson. \"It is now absolutely essential that all states restore their commitment to human rights ... If we fail to act now, the damage to international law risks becoming permanent.\" The Foreign Office denied todaythat the UK had subordinated the rule of law, stating that \"while arrest and prosecution remain the primary goals of our counterterrorism policy, we still need to pursue terrorists through all available means, and we work hard to ensure that the tools we deploy are consistent with human rights\". \"The UK unreservedly condemns the use of torture,\" a spokesman added. \"We have consistently made clear our absolute opposition to torture and our determination to combat it wherever and whenever it occurs.\" However, the commission, which visited the UK and met government representatives as part of the study, raises wider questions of the necessity of new counterterrorism laws. \"The legal framework that existed prior to 9/11 is extremely robust and effective,\" the report says. \"The framework of international law is being actively undermined ... creating a dangerous situation wherein terrorism, and the fear of terrorism, are undermining basic principles of international human rights law.\" The damning tone of the report is likely to raise further questions about the response of the UK government to terrorism and its cooperation with the Bush government's \"war on terror\", a concept condemned by the commission as \"legally flawed\" and setting \"a dangerous precedent\". \"The erosion of international law principles is being led by some of those liberal democratic states that in the past have loudly proclaimed the importance of human rights,\" the report warns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
