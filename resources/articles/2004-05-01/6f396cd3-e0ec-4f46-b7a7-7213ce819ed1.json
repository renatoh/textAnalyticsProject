Middlesbrough are believed to be planning a \u00a36m move for Aiyegbeni to replace Massimo Maccarone, but yesterday the player told Boro manager Steve McClaren that he is not interested in a move to the Riverside and that he wants to see out the remaining two years of his Portsmouth contract. \"I do not want to think about other offers because I am happy at Portsmouth,\" said the Nigerian international, who scored 19 goals in all competitions last season. \"I have a contract here and we are already looking to next season when I believe getting into Europe is a possibility.\" Aiyegbeni joined Pompey from Israeli side Maccabi Haifa in a \u00a3400,000 deal last summer. The 21-year-old was the hero in the club's Premiership survival, scoring 11 goals in the final 10 games of the season, including four in their 5-1 hammering of Middlesbrough on the final day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
