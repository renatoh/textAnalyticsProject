Her race-fitness is the doubt, though, after nearly seven months off and last year\u2019s winner, Definitly Red, has had a similar break. That could leave an opening for race-fit Ballyoptic (3.40), who carried top weight to a nine-length win at Chepstow last time. Wetherby 1.20 On the face of it Cougar\u2019s Gold was a little fortunate to finish second at Exeter last time as three of his opponents went at the second-last. He had been stopped in his tracks a couple of fences earlier, however, and still crossed the line in a decent time. Ascot 1.35 There was plenty of support for Earlofthecotswolds on his chasing debut at Market Rasen last month and he was trading at 1-5 in running when he fell at the second-last. A bit more polish to his jumping should give him the beating of this field. Wetherby 1.55 There was just a neck between Lady Buttons and Indefatigable on identical terms at Doncaster in January and, though the winner had a little in hand, Indefatigable was making only her fourth start over hurdles. She should certainly not be nearly twice the price of the favourite. Ascot 2.10 Only a couple can be ruled out with confidence but The Last Day is on a handy mark on the balance of his form last season. Wetherby 2.30 Thebannerkingrebel has made a decent start to his hurdling career but must give 10lb to a different class of opponent on Saturday. Proschema was useful on the Flat \u2013 he raced off 104 at Goodwood in the summer \u2013 and made a very promising debut over timber at Chepstow last month. Ascot 2.45 Adjali was campaigned in Grade One events as a juvenile and could have more to offer this season than some of his rivals here, though it is clearly a competitive heat for a seasonal debut. Wetherby 3.05 The veteran Unowhatimeanharry would be a hugely popular winner but his best days are now more intermittent than they were in his pomp. Ballyandy is three years younger and has the added benefit of a run this season. Ascot 3.20 Black Corton and Bryony Frost will attract support after a decent return last time while Vinndication is a hot prospect and has had a wind op since last year. At the prices, though, a small interest in Black Corton\u2019s stable companion Adrien Du Pont could be rewarded at around 16-1. He has also had a wind operation, ran well on his handicap debut in this race last year and has gone well fresh in the past."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
