David Hollingworth of brokers L&amp;C said getting a mortgage was taking about double the usual time as lenders struggled with the volume of business, and needed longer to review some applications. \u201cTo get a mortgage offer in normal times you are usually looking at a couple of weeks from the application,\u201d he said, \u201cNow you could be expecting it to take at least a month, or possibly longer.\u201d For self-employed borrowers, for instance, most lenders are looking closely at recent bank statements, instead of two years\u2019 business accounts as previously. \u201cThey are essentially underwriting individual cases and they only have so many staff to do that,\u201d he said. In England and Northern Ireland there is currently a stamp duty holiday on homes costing up to \u00a3500,000, while in Scotland and Wales the tax-break is for properties costing up to \u00a3250,000. The holiday has helped fuel a housing market that was already thriving after it came out of lockdown in the spring. This high demand is one factor in the delays, but dealing with the coronavirus crisis is having an impact on other parts of the homebuying process. \u201cThe conveyancing process is also taking longer,\u201d Hollingworth said. \u201cLocal searches are taking longer because in some councils staff have been redeployed \u2013 the new lockdown could have an impact too.\u201d Hollingworth said L&amp;C was already warning people about the end of the stamp duty holiday on 31 March. \u201cBuying a home can take three months at the best of times \u2013 if you\u2019re not in the process soon you can\u2019t be banking on completing by the end of March.\u201d Last week, online broker Trussle said it was currently taking 115 days to complete a home purchase, meaning buyers would need to make a mortgage application on a property by 6 December. However, in some parts of the country the process is taking longer, with buyers in the East Midlands taking 166 days to complete a deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
