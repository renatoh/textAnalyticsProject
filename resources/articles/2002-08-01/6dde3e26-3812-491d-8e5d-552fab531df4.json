A 40% increase in betting turnover over the past 10 months is expected to lead to a rise of at least 100% in Ibas's caseload, and the service, which is the definitive arbiter in hundreds of betting disputes each year, is struggling to keep up. Chris O'Keeffe, its general manager, believes that the sharp rise in disputes is due in part to the number of new, inexperienced punters who have been drawn into betting shops since deductions ended. The World Cup also generated dozens of disputes, many relating to double bets on Ronaldo to be top scorer and Brazil to win the tournament. \"Compared to the same period, October to May, last year, this year our requests for help are up 56% and caseload is up 43%,\" O'Keeffe says, \"and that doesn't include the World Cup.\" Year-on-year, it seems certain its caseload will at least double. \"In our first full operational year in 2000,\" O'Keeffe says, \"we handled just under 800 cases, and that stayed fairly steady in 2001, but in 2002 it will be close to 2,000. \"Some 38% of cases this year relate to horse racing, with the most common problems being late bets and ambiguous instructions. Football accounts for 28% but internet betting is the big growth area. It was almost non-existent about a year ago, but it's now up to 4% of cases. They can be much more complicated - and you'll often find sites have rules that are very loosely framed.\" The dramatic rise in the number of punters seeking to resolve disputes through Ibas also raises questions about the possible fallout when new legislation makes gambling debts recoverable at law, probably in about two years' time. Will magistrates' courts then become clogged up with punters seeking redress, quite apart from bookmakers pursuing losing punters? And what might it mean for the \"palpable error\" rule, which bookies invoke to avoid a payout when a mistake has allegedly been made over a price? If incorrect odds are written on a slip by a cashier and processed, might a court decide the bookie is contractually obliged to pay out at that price? Such a law could well have unforeseen consequences. The only move of note in British bookies' markets yesterday concerned War Emblem, who won the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park in New Jersey on Sunday night and is now a 6-1 chance (from 8-1) for the Breeders' Cup Classic in October. War Emblem was racing for the first time since the death of Ahmed Salman, who owned the colt via the Thoroughbred Corporation, and also the first time since his failure to complete the Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes in June. Sent off hot favourite at 3-10, the colt made all to take the $600,000 (\u00a3400,000) first prize by 3 lengths and lift his career earnings to near $3.5m (\u00a32.5m). \"He's been training great,\" said his relieved trainer, Bob Baffert. \"That's the War Emblem we all know.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
