The Politics Show, which will replace the long-running and, its critics would say, occasionally long-winded On the Record, will be shorter, and the set-piece extended interview with a senior politician is abandoned. Instead there will be a South Park-style cartoon and an opening \"take on the week\" delivered by the presenter, Jeremy Vine. But as the cameras rolled on the studio set for this weekend's penultimate pilot programme, a senior Department of Culture source confirmed that the way the BBC did politics was to be \"absolutely at the centre\" of the government review of the BBC announced by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, last week. \"We don't care about ratings,\" he said. \"The BBC has a guaranteed income stream from the licence fee. So even when politics is deemed dull, the BBC must be there. The BBC's role is to provide a platform for politics.\" Ms Jowell has been under pressure since she said that the possibility of the BBC losing the \u00a3110 licence fee when its charter comes up for renewal in 2006 was \"somewhere between the improbable and the impossible\". Some sections of the media industry have criticised her for failing to halt the corporation expanding on the back of the licence fee into new technology areas where it competes head on with the commercial sector. But the BBC itself was alarmed when the last election revealed not only a record low turnout at the polls, but record low audience figures for its political reporting. Most people under 55, the BBC survey showed, thought politics on TV was boring. The findings triggered a year-long internal review which concluded, predictably in the minds of critics, that more had to be done to make politics interesting and accessible. Its first fruits are now appearing on BBC TV screens. Last Thursday, This Week, a late night review and discussion programme, was launched, and the week before, the Daily Politics. The programmes are remarkable for looking like a cheap make-over of their predecessors. There is a new desk, throbbing with a ghostly light like a mobile phone, but the lurid red cushions which divide eerily-familiar guests slip from time to time to reveal the same old green benches beneath. The Daily Politics has bombed in the ratings, starting at 300,000 and slumping to 200,000. Fran Unsworth, the woman in charge of political programmes, blamed the follow-on audience from the Teletubbies. The new Politics Show is switching to BBC1 from BBC2, which should guarantee it a better audience than On the Record, which regularly pulled in more than one million, more than Newsnight most nights. It will have the same budget as its predecessor, but only 40 minutes of programming. The extra money is not only for gag-writers' salaries but so that a fleet of satellite trucks can be on standby round the country allowing BBC regions to feed into the national programme. And it will be presented by Vine, who has slipped into Jimmy Young's carpet slippers on Radio 2. \"We have moved away from jumping down people's throats,\" Vine told the Guardian. Their new emphasis will be on policy rather than process. What The Politics Show will not have is the MP-reach of the old On the Record. \"The show got three or four hundred MPs into a BBC studio every year,\" commented a BBC hand. \"It was the BBC's embassy at Westminster, the guarantor of serious, knowledgeable political coverage and the MPs' national platform. Taking it away could turn out a very costly mistake.\" The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Correcions and Clarifications column, Monday January 27 2003 The director of BBC News has asked us to say that contrary to our report The Politics Show will not be shorter than On the Record. He has also assured us that the set-piece interview with politicians has not been dropped. He points out that audiences for another new programme referred to in the piece, The DailyPolitics, have reached 600,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
