A towering presence with a heart of oak. Failure of the season Rotherham. All that fuss and effort to get into the Premiership and absolutely nothing to show for it. Match of the season Never mind the 2003-04 season, the Heineken Cup semi-final in which Wasps beat Munster 37-32 was the match of the decade. In 20 years of covering rugby I have never experienced a club game like it. The atmosphere around Lansdowne Road raised the neck hairs before a ball was kicked and the intensity and drama of the game somehow matched the occasion. Player to watch out for in the summer Radike Samo. Australia want him, Newcastle want him, his native Fiji would love him too. A lock forward with the deft handling skills of a casino croupier, he could easily be the next big global rugby sensation. Comedy moment of the season Hotly contested, as always, but congratulations to the local TV sports presenter who previewed a game featuring \"the French club Pertemps Bees\". Quote of the season \"Why am I retiring? I've had 16 years and I'm knackered\" - Jason Leonard. William Fotheringham Player of the season Rob Howley of Wasps for his impeccable work, weekend in, weekend out, and for a kick and chase which Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud will never live down. Failure of the season Rotherham. They had past experience of the Premiership but failed to recruit strongly enough to compete second time round. Match of the season Wasps' victory at Perpignan in the Heineken Cup. This lacked the final-minute dramas of the semi-final and final but it was a colossal demonstration of control away from home against one of the toughest French club sides. Player to watch out for in the summer Simon Shaw. On fire for Wasps all season and a man with a lot to prove to the England management. Comedy moment of the season The Biarritz defence attempting to pull down Isitolo Maka of Toulouse during their Heineken Cup semi-final. Gulliver and the Lilliputians all over again. Quote of the season \"When you preach discipline as he [Bernard Laporte] does, you shouldn't defend tooth and nail a player who goes to bed at 6am and is positive for cocaine and ecstasy\" - Guy Nov\u00e8s of Toulouse points out an inconsistency over Pieter de Villiers and does his bit for club-country relations among the French. Thomas Castaign\u00e8de Player of the season Lawrence Dallaglio. Winning three trophies - Premiership, European Cup and World Cup - while captaining your club and, for the latter part of the season, your country, is a colossal achievement. Failure of the season The most catastrophic mistake, in its implications at least, was Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud's failing to gather Rob Howley's kick ahead in the Heineken Cup final. The touch judge may have needed glasses but the cup was still lost. Match of the season The Heineken Cup semi between Wasps and Munster. Wasps' achievement in coming back with the match looking lost was massive but doing it in Ireland was greater still. The constantly changing pattern at the end of the game was breathtaking. Player to watch this summer Tom Voyce of Wasps has come from nowhere to have a great season with his club and is now knocking on the England door. A good tour and who knows where he will end up? Comic moment of the season Austin Healey being voted off the panel in Celebrity Weakest Link. It is rare to see Austin lost for words so it had to be treasured. Quote of the season The same evening when Anne Robinson asked with a suggestive smile: \"Where are you going on your holidays, Thomas?\" Now I know why people find her scary. Ian Malin Player of the season Lawrence Dallaglio. He is one of the few England players to have enhanced his reputation since the World Cup, dragging Wasps through a torrid last couple of months to glory on European and domestic fronts. Failure of the season Saracens have had more so-called stars than the Planetarium but, considering their outlay on players, they are England's biggest underachievers. The revolving door at Southgate continues to turn but don't bank on them emulating Wasps. They used to be great rivals, now the clubs are not in the same league. Match of the season Northampton's chances of Heineken Cup glory disappeared with a home defeat by Llanelli but there were glimpses of what might have been with their first win on French soil when they defeated Agen 19-6 at Stade Armandie in January. It was a heroic backs-to-the-wall performance on a paddy field of a pitch. On a gloomy Friday this was Northampton's brightest moment of the season. Player to watch this summer Danny Grewcock. Did not have the happiest of tours to New Zealand six years ago when he was sent off in the Dunedin Test for kicking Anton Oliver. The Bath lock returns to Dunedin next week when he can cement his position as a worthy heir to Martin Johnson. Comedy moment of the season Ridiculing the Toulouse full-back Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud for his gaffe in the last minute of the Heineken Cup final would be unworthy. But, what the heck, step forward Cl\u00e9ment. Quote of the season \"Because he was crap - and so was his replacement\" - Warren Gatland is asked why he took off Trevor Leota in Wasps' defeat at Northampton. Paul Rees Player of the season Simon Shaw. The Bath flanker Andy Beattie was not far behind but Shaw's presence gives Wasps an extra dimension. He is a tight-five forward who does the grunt work but also acts like an extra back-row with his angles of running and ability to pass in contact. Failure of the season Saracens; they were fortunate Rotherham failed to live up to their Titans nickname. Money may buy a team but it does not make it. Lacked the esprit de corps of the Premiership's top five and their response to failure has predictably been to sign more cheques. Match of the season The grand final. It may have lacked the torrent of tries of the Super 12 equivalent but it was far more absorbing, a gladiatorial contest which showed why England won the World Cup; a game which revealed the true essence of rugby union. Player to watch in the summer Harry Ellis. The Leicester scrum-half has the chance to press his claims for the 2007 World Cup and should be given game time. Needs to work on his passing but is a threat around the fringes and was a key figure in the Tigers' revival in the second half of the campaign. Comedy moment of the season Martin Johnson complaining to the referee Tony Spreadbury during Saturday's Wildcard Final about Sale's \"cynical\" play. Spreadbury did a double-take before telling the Leicester captain, a master of the black arts, to get on with it. Quote of the season \"Offence sells tickets; defence wins championships\" - Wasps' assistant coach Shaun Edwards. Mike Averis Player of the season Simon Shaw. A powerful man in the form of his life. He has been the outstanding Wasps forward and the best second-row in the league this season. Now, at last, he gets his chance of a decent run with England. Failure of the season The play-offs again. I can't get excited by something which is bolted on to the season to please the sponsors and rake in a few extra bob. No disrespect to Wasps, they again timed their run brilliantly, but the title should go to the side that proves itself in the regular season. Otherwise what is the league for, and why should leading sides flog themselves if they are already guaranteed a Twickenham place? Match of the season Munster v Wasps in the Heineken semi-final, because it confirmed to a television audience just how good European cup rugby has become. Pipped the final by a whisker. Player to watch in the summer Michael Lipman. The pick of the few genuine open-side flankers available to England. Comedy moment of the season Gloucester, beaten by Munster in the Heineken Cup after two yellow cards helped turn the match, spent the rest of the evening in a Limerick waterfront bar - the Sin Bin. Quote of the season \"I heard Jim say 'Go, go, go'\" - Marcus Horan. \"What I said was 'No, no, no'\" - Jim Williams. Munster prop and his captain on the tap penalty and try that Horan scored to wrap up that Gloucester match at Thomond Park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
