It seemed faintly ridiculous to wear a uniform, never having done so after 18 years of education, and I didn't fancy the pomp and pageantry of it all. Also ridiculous was the \u00a335 I would have to shell out for the gown and mortarboard that would only be worn for two hours. \"You'll be the only one not wearing it,\" the women in the office told me. So there I was among a sea of black gowns in my rebellious white suit. I felt like the head on a pint of Guinness. At most universities I wouldn't have been allowed to graduate. My sister was not allowed to join in her ceremony - at Oxford University - until she'd found a pair of tights to cover up her most unacademic legs. Every university has its own ritual for transforming graduands into graduates, while proud parents look on, and they seem to pride themselves on their subtle variations. At my ceremony yesterday, at Goldsmiths College, London, the presiding officer offered a quick handshake and his congratulations before I darted off stage. Many other universities, however, insist graduands \"doff their caps\" to officials. Cardiff University gives the following advice to students on doffing: \"Nod your head slightly and either touch the front peak of your cap or raise it very slightly, using your right hand.\" At Cambridge University every graduand must be presented to the vice-chancellor by their college's praelector. They do this four at a time. Each holds one of the praelector's fingers and they are \"towed\" towards the vice-chancellor. The vice-chancellor, seated on his throne in Senate House, receives each graduand and confers the degree by placing his hands around theirs and saying: \"Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum Baccalaurei in Artibus, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti\" (by the authority committed to me I admit you to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit). The entire ceremony is conducted in Latin, but students can now elect to have the Trinitarian words omitted, for religious reasons. The tradition at Edinburgh University is to tap the head of every graduate with a cap believed to be made from the seat of John Knox's breeches. John Knox was the renowned Calvinist, reformer and founder of the Presbyterian Church. The cap anoints the heads of 5,000 graduates a year and two years ago needed restoring. The restorers discovered a label inside, dated 1849. John Knox died in 1572, but the tradition continues. St Andrew's University also uses cloth claimed to be from a pair of Knox's trousers in its graduation ceremony. Graduating can be an expensive business. As well as hiring the gown, there's tickets for the ceremony, official photographs and videos and \"class of 2002\" T-shirts to be bought. Guest tickets at Goldsmiths were \u00a318, with a buffet lunch with wine and a jazz band afterwards. Suffolk University charges just \u00a34, while in Edinburgh graduands pay \u00a330. In return, they get to smell a dead puritan's pants and have lifelong membership of the university council. I think I'd rather have Goldsmith's wine and jazz. But for all the merchandise and grandeur, the ceremonies are part of a university's history, and perhaps they should retain them, ridiculous as some may be. The solemnity of such occasions is a signifier of the importance of higher education, especially now as universities look to widen participation. I kind of wish I'd worn the gown."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
