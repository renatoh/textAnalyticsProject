Oh, the endless evil that man will visit upon man! But playthings to the gods are we!\u201d You think: \u201cOoh, that\u2019s Ricky Martin! In tennis whites! Isn\u2019t he ageing well?\u201d Which is to say that, in the opening episode at least, the soapy sensibility of Ryan Murphy, the show\u2019s creator, has some emotional distance to close between the subject and its viewers. There\u2019s also the inescapable high camp elements of the story of the Italian fashion designer\u2019s murder, with which series two of Murphy\u2019s pop culture anthology is concerned. It\u2019s not helped by a weirdly clunky script that has the murderer, Andrew Cunanan, disgorging great lumps of exposition that pop the narrative bubbles we would otherwise be chasing after. On the other hand, maybe it\u2019s not a problem at all. Maybe keeping us at a distance is as knowing and deliberate an artistic decision as Versace\u2019s every design choice in Casa Casuarina. Like Murphy\u2019s first and Bafta-winning American Crime Story, The People vs OJ Simpson, The Assassination is at least in part a commentary on the lenses in front of which a febrile piece of social history played out. When Cucanan\u2019s bullets first met their mark in real life, the reaction from the public was, after all, just as shorn of genuine sorrow. A brand has been shot! Look, there\u2019s Donatella arriving! And Diana and Naomi crying at the funeral! It was only ever deliciously unreal to us. The nine-part series opens with the murder and the first 50-minute episode flashes back and forth from there to 1990, interleaving the evolution of Cununan\u2019s obsession with his victim and the development of the murder investigation. Cunanan is played by Darren Criss, who is a touch stagey. But Criss was a fine turn as Blaine Anderson in Glee, and hopefully he will find his groove over the next eight episodes. Edgar Ramirez as Versace does wonders with his part, managing to evoke the man\u2019s fabled charm and a sort of commanding gentleness that explains why so many clients were drawn to him, and how he built a tiny Milan shop with a single rack of clothes into a billion pound fashion house. Quite what is fact and quite what is fiction is never clear. Donatella et al have disowned the series as \u201ca work of fiction\u201d. The programme itself carries the disclaimer: \u201cSome events are combined or imagined for dramatic and interpretative purposes. Dialogue is imagined to be consistent with these events.\u201d It is entirely in keeping with the genre that it is the bits that you are most sure are made up that are actually true. A fragment of one of the bullets that killed Versace also hit a dove and brought it down next to him. The police had failed to distribute the posters advertising Cunanan \u2013 who had killed four men in six months before Versace \u2013 as one the FBI\u2019s 10 most wanted. And if the fact that a bystander ran to his car to get his Polaroid camera to capture the dying man\u2019s body being loaded into the ambulance doesn\u2019t seem stranger than fiction now, children of the smartphone world, let me assure you it did then. Having looked a little ahead at the series, it does begin to thicken and deepen. You don\u2019t need to feel too guilty about what promises to be a glorious and, given its central subject, eminently unjustifiable pleasure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
