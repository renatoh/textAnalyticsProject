It's not that they're an especially patriotic breed, it's just that they'd really rather you knew they weren't American. They know that, to the rest of the world's ears, the two accents sound very similar and they don't want to be tarred with an American brush. The New Zealanders I've met have all displayed some frustration at the way in which the world constantly assumes they're Australians, too. I'd always thought my Kiwi chums a bit childish on this one - a bit like that girl, Victoria, you went to school with. You know the one; she'd lose her temper if you spelt her name Vicky because: \"I've told you, it's V-I-K-K-I!\" But now I know how those New Zealanders feel because, as unlikely as it seems, I am regularly being mistaken for an Australian. I've been touring America for three months now and about once a week someone asks me where abouts in Australia I'm from. The first and possibly the most bizarre example came on day one of the tour. I was taking a walk around the Californian town of Napa when a car pulled up and the driver asked me for directions. I shrugged my shoulders and with a raise of the eyebrows said, \"I'm sorry, you've just asked the only Englishman in Napa.\" \"Really?\" said the driver. He paused, behind his eyes, cogs were turning, \"so, what part of Australia are you from?\" \"I'm not,\" I said, my mind boggling. I gave him the information again, slowly this time, \"I'm. English.\" \"Yeah, you said,\" he said, adding to my confusion. There was a pause. \"Are you sure? I mean you sure do sound Australian?\" Initially, I put this down as a one-off incident, a misunderstanding created by some strange blip in this gent's hearing, but then similar incidents started to occur with what seemed to be an ever-increasing frequency. The real hotbed for Anglo-Australian confusion was Cleveland. There it happened almost every day throughout our two-week stay and I began to wonder whether a friend had arranged the whole thing - recruiting every waiter and barman in the city as part of some grand and elaborate practical joke. On one occasion the theatre's publicist, Steve, had driven me to a local radio station to promote the show. We were sitting in the waiting room with a cup of coffee chatting to a couple of artists who were also going to be interviewed, when one of them asked me the now familiar question. It was the third time that morning that someone had asked me, and Steve had witnessed each one with growing levels of disbelief and so this time he just laughed. The artist who'd asked the question looked a little insulted, so I explained to him that it was a recurring theme of the tour in general and of that day in particular and then asked him what it was that made me sound Australian. \"Well, I think I'm pretty good with accents,\" he said, and no one bothered to point out the obvious. \"I know cockney and I know scouse, y'know, like the Beatles,\" he continued, \"and you're neither of those so I ruled out England and thought ... I dunno ... maybe Australia?\" I stared back at him trying to work out how best to deal with the flaws in his not-exactly-Sherlock-Holmes-like logic. I mean it's not that he thought I actually sounded Australian ... it was just that when my bland, flat vowels weren't recognised as one of the two cartoon-English accents he knew, he just stuck a pin in his mental map of the English-speaking world. Should I explain that we have more than two whole accents in England? Should I ask him if he'd ever heard an Australian accent before? Eventually the silence was overwhelming and I had to say something ... one word fell from my mouth: \"Strewth!\" Dave Gorman (davegorman.com) is on tour in the US. He stars in Genius, Thursdays on BBC Radio 4 at 6.30pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
