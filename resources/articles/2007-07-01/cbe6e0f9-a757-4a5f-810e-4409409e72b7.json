Tomorrow he will aim to show why he is back among the contenders for a medal at next month's world championships in Osaka. A week ago the 25-year-old Tomlinson, Britain's No1 long jumper, stretched his national record by two centimetres to 8.29m with a performance which underlined the outstanding start he has made to the season. \"Now is the time to keep building on it,\" he said yesterday. \"It has been a great season so far, I have jumped over eight metres on a number of occasions but a great season will only stay a great season if I can achieve something in Japan.\" Tomlinson will seek another impressive distance at the Norwich Union British Grand Prix in Sheffield knowing he will probably need to find another 20 centimetres if he is to live up to the expectations which have followed him during a career in which he has yet to deliver on the championship scene. \"I should have a European or Commonwealth medal by now at least,\" he said. \"After Athens my seasons were wrecked by injury, but I am now in a position where I want to build towards the Olympics again.\" His 8.29m was an impressive step along the way, though in Osaka he knows he will probably have to beat Panama's Irving Saladino, who has cleared 8.53m already this summer. But Tomlinson is back in medal contention at a time when he is moving all over the country to be with his actress fianc\u00e9e, Lucia Rovardi, who is touring Britain as Maria Elena, the wife of the pop star Buddy Holly, in the musical of the same name. Her success on the stage has meant a postponement of their wedding until next May and has seen Tomlinson leave his Middlesbrough roots so the couple are not apart. \"I have been living like a nomad,\" he said. \"One week in London, one week in Newcastle, another week somewhere else, but it has been great. My coach still sets my programmes but I am experienced enough to carry them out on my own. \"It's a fantastic time for Lucia. In the acting world, when the work is there, you have to take it. She is in Jersey at the moment but she is flying in to be here in Sheffield to watch me on Sunday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
