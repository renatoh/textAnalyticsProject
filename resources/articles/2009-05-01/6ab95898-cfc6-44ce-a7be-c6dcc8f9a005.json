The Argentina captain cast doubt over his long-term prospects on Merseyside recently when he said he would be open to offers at the end of the season. That caused Liverpool's manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez's, to inform the \u00a318m midfielder that his comments were poorly timed and that he would not be sold. \"My future is here,\" Mascherano said yesterday. \"I am here and I will continue to give 100% and it will always be like this. I think we have taken a big step this season. In the past three or four seasons Liverpool have lost the league maybe in December or January but this time we are there right at the very end of the season and we still have a chance. Our job now is to continue to work hard and to improve because we have shown that we can win against the biggest teams.\" Liverpool's pursuit of Manchester United could be over before they next play in the Premier League, should Sir Alex Ferguson's team take four points from matches against Wigan tomorrow and at home to Arsenal on Saturday. Mascherano said: \"We know that we still have a chance so we will be supporting the teams who play against United but the main thing is that we are doing our own job. This has been a fantastic season and we are on target to get more points than we have ever had in the Premier League.\" Ben\u00edtez has credited Dirk Kuyt with his finest season at Liverpool. The Dutchman has equalled his highest goal tally for the club, with 14 from 49 matches. \"If there was a Mr Duracell trophy for this year then Dirk would win it,\" said Ben\u00edtez, in reference to Eric Gerets' description of Liverpool as a team of \"Duracell bunnies\" in Marseille earlier this season. \"Mr Duracell is a good description for him because of the way he plays, he is always running and always on the go.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
