In 2016, the superfit 20-year-old was flying through the Hampshire countryside on his bicycle when he was knocked down by a car. He died of his injuries. At the Houghtons\u2019 house in Buckinghamshire, a tall and handsome Will smiles out of family portraits. The bright red racing bike he bought but never rode \u2013 it arrived a fortnight after his death \u2013 hangs on a wall. Houghton recalls she would come downstairs in the morning to find him sitting red-faced and muddy in the kitchen, having cycled 50 miles before breakfast: \u201cHe would be stuffing his face with porridge and saying: \u2018We live in such a beautiful country, Mum.\u2019 That\u2019s what cycling gave him.\u201d \u201cHe had the best life \u2026 we want everyone to have a bit of what Will had,\u201d she says. And, in a way, 12 people did \u2013 his heart beats in another man\u2019s chest, his liver transformed the life of a toddler with a rare disease and his \u201cbeautiful\u201d brown eyes helped four others see. All his mother would like in return is \u201cto know that the fact Will died so young has changed other people\u2019s lives\u201d. But she has heard almost nothing about the people who benefited. \u201cIt\u2019s so upsetting. I knew my 20-year-old son\u2019s heart was out there and I wanted to know that person woke up and thought: \u2018There was a boy who did that for me.\u2019\u201d The gravity of Will\u2019s injuries meant Houghton and her husband, Richard, were escorted by police to the hospital in Southampton where he had been airlifted after the accident. \u201cI relive that every day,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are half thinking the worst because you are in a police car. When we got there, they took us into a room and the doctor asked: \u2018What do you know?\u2019 I said I knew it was bad. He said: \u2018It\u2019s unsurvivable.\u2019 It is like a bulldozer hitting you.\u201d The opinionated and lively sports science student, whose loves included US politics, reality TV and Skittles, had been vocal about his decision to join the donor register. \u201cOnce we knew we had no hope, it all became about his organs,\u201d says Houghton. \u201cIf someone had said to me before the accident: \u2018We want to have Will\u2019s eyes,\u2019 I would have said: \u2018No way.\u2019 He was so handsome. But when it happened, I wanted them to take every single piece of him. I didn\u2019t want one thing going in the ground.\u201d Families can opt to receive a letter containing basic information about the recipients, which arrives about a fortnight after donation. They are also asked if they would like to receive a thank you letter should one be written. But while more than 90% of donor families say they would like to be contacted, only 20% of recipients write. Houghton, who co-founded the clothing brand Mint Velvet, is working with NHS Blood and Transplant (NHS BT) \u2013 the health authority with responsibility for transplant services \u2013 on an initiative that may increase the number of letters exchanged. Called Don\u2019t Forget the Donor, its aim is to improve the support and materials available to recipients who want to write, but are unsure how to go about it. Angela Ditchfield, an organ-donation nurse who is assisting with the initiative, says: \u201cAnything we can do to make the grief and bereavement journey better is a good thing. Donor families say it is something they find comforting. They want to hear that their loved one has helped save someone\u2019s life.\u201d The psychology involved is complex, and Ditchfield suggests some recipients find it daunting. \u201cThey think \u2018thank you\u2019 is not enough,\u201d she says. \u201cBut to the donor family, I think that is all they want; an acknowledgment that their loved one has helped somebody and given them back their life. If we can give recipients the support and information to do that, then the families who want to receive a letter may get one.\u201d Houghton agrees: \u201cI think people are so worried about offending us or saying the wrong thing \u2013 or they feel that it\u2019s too late. There is this idea they have to write a massive letter and turn up on the One Show. But what I want to know is that Will\u2019s life mattered.\u201d Last year, the Houghtons received their first letter \u2013 it typically takes recipients about two years to write to donors \u2013 from a woman whose toddler had received Will\u2019s liver. The writer was worried the letter could upset them, and would be \u201chard\u201d to read, but Houghton says the acknowledgment and thanks are healing. \u201cTo us, your son is our hero,\u201d reads Houghton. \u201cI think about your son every day.\u201d Katie Morley, a recipient coordinator for NHS BT, says it is important to remember that recipients should not feel pressured into writing, as they may be dealing with physical and mental problems following their surgery. Also, not every transplant has a happy ending: two of Will\u2019s organs failed. \u201cTransplant is a procedure that will hopefully lead to a better quality of life,\u201d Morley says. \u201cBut the recipients still have health problems.\u201d The drugs prescribed after transplantation, for instance, often cause hand tremors, which would make it difficult to write. Morley adds: \u201cSome medication can affect your mood and heighten your emotions during a period that is already very emotional. Choosing whether or not to correspond with the donor families should not be forced on to anyone.\u201d Next year, the law will change in England and Scotland \u2013 but not Northern Ireland \u2013 from an opt-in to an opt-out system (something that already applies in Wales). More than 6,200 Britons are waiting for life-saving transplants in the UK, but on average three of them die each day. Campaigners and medical professionals have long argued that having to actively register your consent has restricted the supply of organs. At the moment roughly two-thirds of families approached about donation agree; NHS BT aims for a consent rate of 80%. Wales has the highest consent rate of all UK nations, at 77%, up from 58% in 2015 when the law changed. But, even so, only 1% of people die in circumstances (such as a hospital intensive care unit or emergency department) that make it possible for them to be donors. Ditchfield thinks publicity around the change in the law will encourage people to have a conversation. \u201cI think, as a society, we don\u2019t like talking about death and dying. Tell your loved ones what you want.\u201d When she received no further letters about Will, Houghton used the NHS service to reach out to the other recipients. (The letter is sent to the recipient\u2019s transplant centre, and they are asked if they want to read it.) Then a second letter arrived, written by the son of a man who, he explained, does not speak much English. After more than a decade of dialysis, his father\u2019s life has been transformed by a kidney transplant from Will, and for Houghton the sense that \u201csomething good has come out of all the sadness\u201d is overwhelming. \u201cThank you just doesn\u2019t seem enough, but that is all I can offer you,\u201d he writes. \u201cThank you for bringing such a brave and selfless individual into this world. Thank you for Will.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
