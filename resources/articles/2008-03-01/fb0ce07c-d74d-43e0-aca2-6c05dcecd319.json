Yet the Blair-Bush embrace means that the failed neocon project has also left liberal internationalism at its weakest point since 1989. The internationalist left should not react to Bush's adoption of the language of human rights and democracy by ditching its own principles and values. The critique we need of Bush is the damage done to those great causes. To adopt a realist Henry Kissinger-style critique or an absolutist conception of state sovereignty denies the left's own values. Yet those who avoid that trap often fall into another. Tony Blair's fatal error was to fail to take the neocon agenda seriously, or separate his own liberal internationalist project from it. \"I've never known what people mean when they go on about this neocon thing,\" Blair told Jim Naughtie in an interview for his book The Accidental American. Blair was not a neocon. Yet as Irwin Stelzer notes in his anthology Neo-conservatism, that he allowed himself to become \"a non-neocon raised by neocons to the exalted status that was until now accorded only to Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher\". The book includes Blair's 1999 Chicago speech. Yet its theme - a doctrine of new rules for the international community - focused on two concepts (rules, community) which are anathema to neocons. Multilateralism was the central theme. \"Any new rules will only work if we have reformed international institutions with which to apply them\", argued the pre-Bush Blair in 1999. We easily now forget how - before Iraq - Blair's internationalist instincts were in tune with most of his party and the broader liberal-left. Douglas Hurd's classically amoral response to the implosion of Yugoslavia and the west's indifference to the Rwandan genocide drove a significant rethinking of liberal-left foreign policy. There was broad Labour support for the effective intervention in Sierra Leone and - more controversially - Kosovo. Blair believed that September 11 2001 could provide a catalyst for strengthening international law. His 2001 Labour conference speech set out a broad agenda - including a just Middle East peace, African development and a commitment to human rights - as a necessary corollary to military action against al-Qaida and the Taliban. Standing \"shoulder to shoulder\" in the hope of exercising a decisive influence with the Bush White House, Blair couldn't see that this broad vision was never shared in Washington. Instead of securing Afghanistan, the rush to war in Iraq threw away the solidarity that existed on September 12 2001 and the broad coalition built after it, diverting attention from Islamist terrorism to the quite different problem of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship in Iraq. Yet Iraq clearly failed the \"just war\" tests of liberal internationalism, and despite Saddam's appalling human rights record, was never conceived as a \"humanitarian intervention\". Rescuing liberal internationalism requires what Blair never offered: a much clearer analysis of where it should differ deeply from the neocon project. Liberal hawks who insist on retaining a \"shoulder to shoulder\" approach in the face of a \"totalitarian threat\" miss this central point. Alan Johnson's diagnosis of neoconitis suggests a \"cure\" which would kill the liberal internationalist patient for good: his analogy with total war against Hitler sounds like a recipe for the suppression of democratic scrutiny as long as it takes to \"win\" the \"war on terror\". But, as Philip Gordon asked in a cogent Foreign Affairs essay, what does victory look like? The real world debate is shifting. Bush is a lame duck. The remaining presidential candidates have sharp foreign policy differences, but all are aware of the damage done to America's global reputation. The US may yet follow the Brown administration in Britain, which has dropped the \"war on terror\" rhetoric and is quietly constructing a more nuanced anti-terrorism strategy (though its detention powers proposals remain at odds with this). Just because the term \"neocon\" can be (like \"fascism\") thrown around like confetti, that does not prevent it retaining an accurate meaning. Francis Fukuyama's After the neocons - an insider's obituary - is a good place to start. Fukuyama defines four core principles of neoconservatism: \"Firstly, a concern with democracy, human rights and more generally the internal politics of states; secondly, a belief that US power can be used for moral purposes; thirdly, a scepticism about the ability of international law and institutions to solve security problems; and fourthly, a distrust of ambitious social engineering projects.\" Liberal internationalists do share the first principle - that foreign policy should reflect, and seek to extend, democratic values - but too often the debate seems to start and end there. We also need to set out how significant disagreements on the other three principles would create a very different practical agenda. On US power, the need for US engagement - and the fear of isolation - was a significant lesson of the 1990s. But that is different from a starry-eyed belief in American virtue: that America could be a benign hegemon, because it is America. What the world thinks of US power depends on how it is used. Using power wisely creating the postwar multilateral institutions and the Marshall Plan won global respect. The Bush presidency rejected multilateral checks on US power and invented a new foreign policy doctrine to give the US rights to preemptive action which would not apply to others. So the multilateral legitimacy of rules and institutions must be central, while neocons see the need to get a \"permission slip\" as an irritating impertinence. Multilateral \"club membership\" - creating institutions with rules which others want to join - has proved much the most effective way of achieving long-term and voluntary \"regime change\". Look at Europe after 1989. Finally, there can be no opt-out of state-building. It is bizarre that neocons, so sceptical about whether government can do anything at home, embarked on the project of democratising the Middle East. This is the \"hidden hand\" stuff happens theory of democracy: knock over tyranny and what results is freedom. The scandalous lack of attention to Iraqi reconstruction was less a failure to plan than an ideological choice. The mockery of nation-building on the US right has only proved, tragically, the social democratic case that there can be no democracy and no market without building the institutions of a functioning state. After Iraq, any rescue of liberal internationalism will be very difficult. Military force may remain necessary in cases of genocide and extreme humanitarian emergency - but never again \"preemptive\" action, especially on premises which proved false. Instead, we need a much greater emphasis on prevention and on legitimacy by making a reality of the Responsibility to Protect agenda. And we need a new focus on democratic solidarity from below - more a job for civil society campaigns (www.avaaz.org) than governments - and starting from a \"contextual universalism\" which does not insist that we know best but asks first what democrats in Iran, Burma or Zimbabwe want us to do - and not do. Learning the lessons would create a different, humbler agenda. But if we have to accept that the neocon embrace has killed off liberal internationalism for good then it will prove impossible to replace Bush's unilateralism with the \"new multilateralism\" we need."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
