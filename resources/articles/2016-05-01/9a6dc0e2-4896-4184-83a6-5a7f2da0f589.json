It was for a 10-minute short, a little drama he\u2019d cut, which played before a feature at the 1974 New Zealand film festival \u2013 its first and last screening. In the audience were his drinking buddies from The Duke of Edinburgh hotel, a \u201cdubious dive\u201d in Wellington he used to frequent on Friday nights. \u201cIt\u2019s not there any more, they demolished it,\u201d he says, then pauses. \u201cJust as well. \u201cI was keeping a low profile, anyway. The credits came up with our names, then one of them yelled out, \u2018For fuck\u2019s sake. It\u2019s a New Zealand movie!\u2019\u201d Forty-two years later, and Neill\u2019s had a career of almost unparalleled versatility, taking in drama (Dead Calm, 1989), cult classics (Event Horizon, 1997), blockbusters (Jurassic Park, 1993), and television (last year\u2019s BBC miniseries And Then There Were None). With it has come the kind of international profile that in New Zealand means you\u2019ve made it: the rest of the world thinks you\u2019re Australian. That may be about to change. Hunt for the Wilderpeople \u2013 Neill\u2019s new film, which premiered in competition at this year\u2019s Sundance film festival \u2013 couldn\u2019t have come from anywhere else. With its \u201cegg\u201d sledge and \u201cskux\u201d honour, it\u2019s so quintessentially Kiwi as to defy explanation. A comment on a Guardian review of the film asked if it was going to be subtitled. \u201cWe had no idea what was going to happen at Sundance \u2013 it was heart-in-throat stuff,\u201d says Neill, nursing a milky coffee at a plush Sydney hotel (the waiter had assumed it was for me: Neill\u2019s got the facial hair for a long black). \u201cTo our surprise and delight, people were laughing from the moment it started.\u201d In 1974, New Zealand film was \u201cthe funniest idea\u201d, remembers Neill \u2013 \u201cthe stupidest, most ridiculous thing you could possibly consider\u201d. These days, it has a reputation for well-received, weird comedy, thanks to Brett McKenzie and Jemaine Clement of The Flight of the Conchords, the comedian Rhys Darby, and the filmmaker Taika Waititi, with whom Clement and Darby collaborated on the vampire-mockumentary What We Do In The Shadows. Neill calls them \u201cthe school of cool\u201d. And at 68, he wanted in. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is Waititi\u2019s fourth feature film, based on the book Wild Pork and Watercress by Barry Crump, a New Zealand author of comic novels about his experiences as a \u201cbushman\u201d. \u201cI grew up with his books \u2013 we all did,\u201d says Neill. (The national encyclopaedia says Crump\u2019s novels have sold more than a million copies domestically. It doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but there are only 4.5 million New Zealanders.) \u201cSo the idea of that kind of blend of cool, strange New Zealand comedy, which is like nothing else on the planet, with the old-school, rough-and-ready stuff that Barry Crump represents \u2013 that was fairly irresistible.\u201d Neill plays Uncle Hec, a bushman of few words whose world is split open by the arrival of Ricky, a street-smart foster child played by Julian Dennison. The gruff father-figure, who has his edges smoothed against his will by chipper children, is reminiscent of his character in Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1993 Jurassic Park \u2013 easily Neill\u2019s highest-profile role with the millennial generation, as was clear from the affectionate nods to it in last year\u2019s blockbuster reboot, Jurassic World. \u201cWell, there were certainly a lot of the same gags [in Jurassic World],\u201d he says without missing a beat. \u201cLike, get a couple of kids in a pod or a car or something, then beat the shit out of them with the worst dinosaurs you can possibly imagine.\u201d The untimely, brutal end of Bryce Dallas Howard\u2019s character\u2019s assistant \u2013 \u201cthe poor girl with the mobile phone\u201d \u2013 unsettled him. \u201cPoor thing. I had nothing against her at all ... She was stuck with these kids \u2013 who wants to be stuck with kids that have nothing to do with you? It\u2019s one of the themes of the Wilderpeople. It\u2019s reasonable. \u201cOther people\u2019s kids! Jesus! Give us a break!\u201d Off-screen, Neill says, his relationship with the child actor Dennison was more \u201ca meeting of 12-year-old minds\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re both pretty juvenile. We both finds farts funny. He knows the words to different songs than I do, it has to be said.\u201d He recounts, with increasing disbelief, Dennison telling an interviewer that his favourite group was Coldplay. \u201cColdplay! I mean, what the fuck? He\u2019s full of surprises.\u201d (One of which was Dennison\u2019s disapproval of swearing: \u201cI had to watch myself. I swear all the time.\u201d) The film follows Hec and Ricky\u2019s madcap adventures on the run (through stunning scenery \u2013 aerial shots of glassy lakes and snow-covered mountains must be a condition of government funding for all New Zealand films), with their sometimes fractious bromance at its heart. \u201cThere\u2019s something about this film that really touches people,\u201d says Neill. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure what it is, but we can all identify people that are on the periphery. They\u2019re all outsiders, these people \u2013 they\u2019re damaged, they\u2019re sidelined.\u201d That makes the film sound more edgy than it is. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is essentially a buddy comedy that bridges generations, so eminently family-friendly (it\u2019s set in the capital-G great out-of-doors, for goodness\u2019 sake) so as to almost seem quaint. But that\u2019s part of its otherworldly, anachronistic charm \u2013 it\u2019s hard to know whether it\u2019s set in the present day and just dated (the way so many rural New Zealand homes are), or actually of the past. \u201cThings date and suddenly you can no longer see the performance because you\u2019re just riveted by the shoulder pads,\u201d says Neill. \u201c\u2018Oh Christ, look at their hair!\u2019\u201d In contrast to the heckles that met his short in 1974, New Zealand has thrown its weight behind Hunt for the Wilderpeople in unprecedented fashion. After the biggest opening weekend ever for a local film, it has made more at the NZ box office than Fast &amp; Furious 7, The Avengers or any Harry Potter or Hunger Games movie. The publicist tells me that about one in nine New Zealanders have seen it. Neill has been relishing the positive response on Twitter, where he regularly tweets \u2013 with more enthusiasm than attention to punctuation \u2013 to 87,500 followers (\u201c140 characters is about as long as I can make a sentence, or even a cogent thought\u201d). In late April, he shared a link to an opinion piece published in Fairfax New Zealand by Russell Harding, who praised the film\u2019s \u201cnostalgic but authentic\u201d depiction of the country \u2013 one he recognised from a time before it became obsessed with house prices and its people turned \u201csoft on the outside, and cold and hard in the middle\u201d. Harding concluded: \u201cKiwis aren\u2019t clapping at the end of the movie for no reason.\u201d Neill had already heard about the spontaneous applause, and marvelled at it: \u201cThat never happens.\u201d Just as rare is an unsettling experience he had en route to Australia. \u201cPeople were smiling at me at the airport. Well, that never happens. They were smiling! At me!\u201d Aren\u2019t you a national hero? \u201cNo. I think they think, \u2018Oh my god, it\u2019s that prick. Move on quickly\u2019.\u201d It seems there\u2019s something about Hunt for the Wilderpeople that prompts the patriotism, whether the New Zealand it depicts ever existed \u2013 or never went away. After its smash-hit success at home, and its warm reception at Sundance, the question will be how well it is received further afield; it has yet to be tested in Australia, the US and the UK. But the world loves to see New Zealand as a wonderland of warm-hearted weirdness, as was evident from international media coverage of its government-mandated flag debate, which cost millions of dollars, took more than a year \u2013 and, inexplicably to outsiders, resulted in the same flag. Neill voted for retention. The proposed alternative design, he says, was \u201cjust cheap and nasty and embarrassing ... it looks like a logo for swim shorts or something. It\u2019s just all wrong. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to change the flag, let\u2019s do so when we become a republic.\u201d That seems inevitable both sides of the Tasman, he says. He remembers being asked what flag to put on the arm of his character\u2019s overalls for the 1997 science fiction horror Event Horizon, in which he played an Australian astronaut. \u201cI took the Union Jack off it and put the Aboriginal flag in its place. That stays contemporary, that little touch ... I said, \u2018The Australian flag will not look like that anymore\u2019.\u201d Hunt for the Wilderpeople is out in Australia from Thursday 26 May. It is distributed in the United States from 24 June. Neill also stars alongside Adrien Brody in Backtrack, a coming psychological thriller from director Michael Pertroni"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
