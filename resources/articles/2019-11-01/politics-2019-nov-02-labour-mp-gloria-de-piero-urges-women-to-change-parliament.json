One of 58 MPs who have announced that they will not be standing in the 12 December general election, De Piero, who represents Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, said she hoped women would not be deterred from entering frontline politics. \u201cI would still say to anybody who wants to change the country - it does have strains and stresses, but I wouldn\u2019t have not done this for the bloody world.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not great at the moment: but come into parliament and change it. All that progress that we\u2019ve made in getting women there: we can\u2019t go back on that.\u201d Several of the women who are stepping down from parliament, including the former Conservative Heidi Allen, have cited the toxic political debate in explaining their reasons for quitting Westminster. And the independent MP Anna Soubry has detailed a string of threats, most recently including a card posted through the door of her partner. De Piero said that she had taken security precautions, on the advice of the police and parliamentary authorities. \u201cMy mailbox is bombproof: there was a letterbox in my door, and it\u2019s probably sensible that I don\u2019t have that any more. I have an external mailbox, that\u2019s bombproof. And I have good locks on my door, fitted by the parliamentary authorities. \u201cI\u2019ve got a panic button as well, in my house \u2013 but I\u2019m OK,\u201d she adds. She also doesn\u2019t publicise in advance where she is going to be, in accordance with police advice \u2013 and admits she does feel nervous before going out door-knocking. \u201cBefore every one of my canvass sessions, because I\u2019ve seen it on social media I think, \u2018Oh God, am I going to be OK?\u2019. Because I canvass a lot. But touch wood, it\u2019s always been OK on the doorstep.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to all these women, I\u2019m sure there will be different reasons why they\u2019re standing down,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s worth exploring that to find out. But at this stage, I still want to say to women out there \u2013 do this, you will never regret it.\u201d And she points to the \u201cgreat solidarity\u201d among women MPs. \u201cMy female friends, Vicky Foxcroft, Stephanie Peacock, Louise Haigh - you will make friends in there that will support you through the tough times. Your women colleagues, you put your arms round each other, and you\u2019re there for each other.\u201d De Piero cites harrying the government into implementing equal pay audits as Ed Miliband\u2019s shadow women\u2019s minister \u2013 under legislation passed by Labour but set aside by the coalition \u2013 as an example of the difference even opposition MPs can make. \u201cYou can change the law,\u201d she adds, pointing to the case of a woman constituent who had been a victim of domestic violence. \u201cA woman came to see me about a year ago. She had some scars, she said \u2018my husband is serving time for attempting to kill me, he is in prison, he is now entitled, as part of the divorce, to half the house\u2019\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that \u2013 and I went to see the minister, and nobody seemed to know it. So I\u2019ve been working on amendments to the domestic violence bill to remove the automatic presumption of joint assets.\u201d \u201cI just hope my colleagues will continue that work when they come back. But it\u2019s things like that: you can\u2019t learn that from any book.\u201d As a former broadcast journalist who grew up in a working-class family, De Piero says encounters like this have changed her political perspective dramatically. \u201cYou leave Bradford, you go to university, and you\u2019re not conscious of this along the way, but you\u2019re getting a bit more liberal. Then you go into the London media: and before you know it, you are pushing some very, very predictable lines. Which you think are original, but actually everybody in your bubble thinks those things. \u201cAnd I just felt, when I came to do this job and I started knocking on doors in 2010 I was like, \u2018shit, this conversation is totally different\u2019. I thought the world had changed, on my little journey from Bradford to London, and it hadn\u2019t: I had changed.\u201d She warns there are still too few MPs from backgrounds like hers who make it to Westminster \u2013 or even consider it. \u201cSpeaking from the working class is as important as speaking for the working class. That\u2019s why I have talked about my background: not because it is a badge of honour, obviously it is miserable to grow up in child poverty. I just think the more people know that there are people in there who weren\u2019t born with a silver spoon in their mouth, the better.\u201d She was one of the 19 Labour MPs who took the controversial decision to vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal at its first parliamentary stage last month \u2013 hoping, she said at the time, to amend it: a process that was brought to a halt when the general election was called. That decision came from the feeling that voters in constituencies like hers should have their voices heard, she says \u2013 but she has been taken aback by the toxic tone of the debate, in Westminster, on social media, and in her inbox. \u201cWe get emails - saying that you\u2019re a traitor. Because of course the weird thing is \u2013 and this is what illustrates the gulf over Brexit more than anything \u2013 is that up here they think I\u2019m trying to stop Brexit. Down there, I go down and they think that I\u2019m bloody Nigel Farage, some of my colleagues, to put it bluntly.\u201d De Piero had always intended to step down after 10 years, she says \u2013 or as it has turned out, nine, all of them on the backbenches, and the last three dominated by Brexit. As she prepares to leave the House of Commons for the last time, she now wonders whether she did the right thing in not backing Theresa May\u2019s deal. \u201cWhat do I ever regret? Not voting for Theresa May\u2019s deal? I think about it a lot.\u201d May\u2019s deal, unlike Johnson\u2019s, would have underpinned EU standards on workers\u2019 rights in law \u2013 and while it didn\u2019t include a customs union, it needn\u2019t have precluded a future government from negotiating one. \u201cI\u2019ll never know whether I did the right thing there, but I know I ask myself a lot,\u201d she says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
