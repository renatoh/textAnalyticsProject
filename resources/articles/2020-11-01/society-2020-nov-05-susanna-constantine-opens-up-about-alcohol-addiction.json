The presenter said she previously felt shame about her drinking and acknowledged that she tended to project her flaws on to the people around her. However, she said she felt liberated after she realised she could change her life. \u201cI\u2019m in recovery, so I\u2019m an alcoholic and I\u2019ve been in recovery for nearly seven years now,\u201d Constantine told the podcast My Mate Bought a Toaster. \u201cAs an addict, often what you would do, and certainly what I did, I would put all my own defects \u2013 I would find someone else to attach them to. And so I thought my husband was passive aggressive, but actually I was the one who was passive aggressive. \u201cAnd that I\u2019ve realised over time and being in recovery. I was the awful, angry \u2013 passive aggressive and my poor husband was the one who had to live with it.\u201d The former Strictly Come Dancing contestant added: \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019ve spoken about before really, but it\u2019s important.\u201d Constantine, who has previously spoken about giving up drinking but did not disclose the reason, has been in recovery since 2013. She told the podcast about the moment she acknowledged she had a problem. \u201cIt was so liberating. I felt a lot of shame most of the time \u2026 the relief was so immense because I could change it. I wasn\u2019t having to try and change someone else. It was down to me. I was responsible and accountable for becoming a better person and getting sober and well,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so it was the most extraordinary relief to have that lightbulb moment.\u201d Asked if she drank while she was working and whether it affected her work, Constantine replied: \u201cNo, I was highly functioning.\u201d Her former co-host Woodall has previously talked openly about her own problems with alcohol, saying she began drinking seriously at 16 and, after spells in and out of rehab, stopped at the age of 26. She told the Guardian in 2007: \u201cI think I just took a while to know myself. I went on a journey to find out. I was a bit wild.\u201d Woodall said she self-medicated \u201cagainst the intensity\u201d, adding: \u201cI was in this European social environment and it was quite fast-paced. I had to medicate myself to feel comfortable. I just took a long time to wake up. When I came out of it all I was a different person, but very raw.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
