Superb in the victory over Argentina, he has finally begun to eliminate the errors that made critics hesitate to put him on a par with the late Bobby Moore. Now looking like one of the best defenders in the world. Agent's view Rio has emerged as one of the best defenders in the tournament. He has marshalled the England defence superbly but you have to say that the other three, and the goalkeeper David Seaman, have been immaculate, too. There have already been rumours that Manchester United are on the point of signing him. Value before tournament \u00a320m Value now \u00a330-35m RONALDO (Brazil) Position Striker Club Internazionale The man haunted by the curious events before the World Cup final at France 98 has proved himself again by scoring five goals in the tournament. He says: \"I have an itch to play in England. Everyone talks of the Spanish and Italian leagues but people who love football must agree that England has a flair of its own.\" Agent's view I don't think he had a transfer value at all before the tournament; a lot of questions were being asked about him. He has answered most of them but I don't think anyone can yet say that he is back to what he was. But anyone who scores five goals in the first four games of the World Cup is performing well. If I were a manager, I would take him on loan and base a fee on his performances. Value before tournament - Value now \u00a320m DENNIS ROMMEDAHL (Denmark) Position Right winger Club PSV Eindhoven The man said to be able to run 100 metres in 10.3 seconds - which puts him in Olympic finalist class - could not prise open England's defence. But he was highly influential in the victory over France that put the holders out. At 23, he looks an outstanding prospect and the Aston Villa manager Graham Taylor has already made a bid for him. Taylor did not meet PSV Eindhoven's \u00a39m valuation, however, and must now decide whether to go back with more money. Certainly looks an ideal Premiership player. Agent's view Here's another guy who is made for the Premiership and when you take a player from anywhere in Scandinavia there is not the slightest of risks. He's got pace and strength and works hard and could be one of the players who sparks the transfer rush. If managers are looking for wingers this summer, he will be high on a few clubs' lists. I think there will be more creative transfer dealings this summer and we could see a few swap deals. Value before tournament \u00a36m Value now \u00a38-10m PAPE BOUBA DIOP (Senegal) Position Midfielder Club Lens Whatever else happens in his career, he will always be remembered for the strike that allowed Senegal to beat France in the opening game, instigating one of the biggest shocks in the history of the competition. In the game against Uruguay he proved that was no fluke with two goals. Turkey will look to track his runs into the box in the quarters. Agent's view People keep talking about the emerging nations of Africa but they've emerged now. It used to be just Nigeria and Cameroon but the South Africans are looking much better and Senegal have been sensational. Diop encapsulates all the qualities of their side - he can play, he's got pace, power and athleticism. After the way he took his goals in the World Cup, he can go and play anywhere. Value before tournament \u00a35m Value now \u00a310-15m AHN JUNG-HWAN (South Korea) Position Forward Club Perugia If he wasn't already one of the biggest stories of the World Cup after the golden-goal header that knocked out Italy, he certainly was when Luciano Gaucci, Perugia's president, announced that he had been sacked. \"It is not because he scored the goal against my country but because he said Korean football was better than Italian football,\" Gaucci said. \"I feel offended by that.\" Agent's view Has been Korea's outstanding player and it is unbelievable that his club could react the way they have. The Italian connection probably caused him to miss that penalty because he said that when he went up to take it his head had gone. If Perugia stick to their word, they've already taken a chunk off of his market value. Value before tournament \u00a3500,000 Value now \u00a35-6m BRIAN McBRIDE (US) Position Striker Club Colombus Crew Scored a terrific diving header in the US's opening game to give them an astonishing 3-0 lead against Portugal in the 36th minute. It was also McBride's head down from a corner that allowed John O'Brien to score the opening goal. Has been a threat up front in every match. One of the finds of the tournament. Agent's view At only 20, McBride looks a prospect, but when players come from the American league to Europe, you just don't know whether they are going to bridge the gap in class. Value before tournament \u00a3200,000 Value now \u00a31.6m JUNICHI INAMOTO (Japan) Position Midfielder Club Arsenal Cannot get a Premiership start for Arsenal but showed what they might be missing with a stunning goal against Belgium in his team's opening game. Inamoto's outstanding midfield work infused his country with confidence and his clinical finish from 12 yards against Russia gave Japan their first victory in the World Cup finals. His goal against Belgium was one of the best of the competition, outrunning three defenders before curling a shot over the goalkeeper. Agent's view He's a great example of a player who has not done much at league level before becoming a star at international level. He played some tremendous football in the opening two games, showing that he can make good tackles, pass the ball and score goals. He may have impressed Ars\u00e8ne Wenger enough to put him in the side next year. Value before tournament \u00a34m Value now \u00a36m IKER CASILLAS (Spain) Position Goalkeeper Club Real Madrid He is not tall or old but he has shown a lot of maturity and made some outstanding saves that have proved important to a side whose outfield players have been erratic. Was Spain's man of the match as Ireland turned up the heat in their second-round match and became a national hero when saving three penalties in the shootout. His home town of Mostoles is to name a street after him - presumably a dead end. Agent's view He's a real interesting one because he's only 21 and was kept out of the Real Madrid side by Cesar Sanchez for much of the season. But he came on in the 68th minute of the European Cup final when Cesar was injured and now he's Spain's No1. In terms of goalkeeping, he's only a baby - it will probably be another 10 years before he reaches his peak. Look at Seaman and Brad Friedel, who is 31 and has had a great World Cup, too. So you have got to think that this lad would be a fabulous buy for someone. Value before tournament \u00a33m Value now \u00a37.5m HASAN SAS (Turkey) Position Attacking midfielder Club Galatasaray Made his mark in the opening game with a stunning left-footed volley against Brazil on the stroke of half-time. Was Turkey's best player in the 1-1 draw with Costa Rica and was again outstanding in the final group game against China when scoring the opening goal and setting up the second and third. Agent's view I remember going out to the Uefa Cup final between Arsenal and Galatasaray and reading that the Gunners just had to turn up to win it. But I knew how much Turkish football had improved and how dangerous a player Sas was. He did not actually start that final, coming on in the 84th minute. But he is a big strong striker who would definitely interest European clubs. Like the other Turkish stars, he can be a bit temperamental but has very good technical ability, as he proved against Brazil. Value before tournament \u00a34m Value now \u00a37m MARC WILMOTS (Belgium) Position Forward Club Schalke 04 A 33-year-old striker who proved that age is no barrier with vintage performances in each of his matches. In the opening game he served up a wonderful overhead kick to give his side the lead against Japan. In the following match, he proved his finishing instincts by snapping up a chance from a few yards out. Scored his third goal of the tournament with a left-footed effort in the 82nd minute. Gave Brazil some uncomfortable moments in their second-round encounter. Agent's view I tried to bring him to England on a few occasions, but each time he suffered a major injury and nothing came of it. It's a shame because he would have done very, very well in the Premiership and still might do a job for someone. He's a really lively player and puts everything into a game, the sort of player the crowd love. At 33, he hasn't got much value in the market because there would be no return when his contract ran out so is probably worth a little less than before. But one of the smaller Premiership clubs might think him worth a small amount because he would give great value for money. Value before tournament \u00a32m Value now \u00a32m ANDERS SVENSSON (Sweden) Position Midfielder Club Southampton A typical bargain buy by Southampton who has performed exceptionally well. Helped to turn the game against England when coming on as a substitute for Magnus Svensson and scored a stunning swerving 25-yard free-kick to equalise against Argentina. Then was within a whisker of a golden goal against Senegal when he turned 360 degrees to make space for himself in the box before planting a shot against a post five minutes into extra-time. Agent's view He didn't have much time to settle in the Premiership after signing for Southampton but, as I have said, you can trust anyone from the Scandinavian countries. Having shown that he can score top-quality goals at the highest level, his price must have doubled. If he can build on that next season, it could go even higher. Value before tournament \u00a34m Value now \u00a37.5m DAMIEN DUFF (Ireland) Position Forward Club Blackburn Rovers Deservedly won the man-of-the-match award for his performance in the 3-0 win over Saudi Arabia. Was dangerous throughout the match, serv ing up crosses from both wings, and got his reward with an 87th-minute goal. Duff also looked a potential match winner against Spain. Agent's view Damien had a pretty good season in the Premiership, so no one will be surprised at the way he played in the World Cup. I'm sure Blackburn won't be looking to sell and they don't need the money. But everyone has a price and if any so-called big club was looking for a left-sided player who can both create and finish, then I would expect them to look at someone like Damien. Value before tournament \u00a36-7m Value now \u00a310-15m MIROSLAV KLOSE (Germany) Position Striker Club 1FC Kaiserslautern The man who has solved Germany's goalscoring crisis (but only if the ball is in the air). After three headed efforts against Saudi Arabia, Klose, 24, managed two more with his head in the games against Ireland and Cameroon, taking his total to an impressive 13 goals in 16 international matches. In the running for the Golden Boot award, though it would have to be renamed the Golden Bonce award. Agent's view Came here as a virtual unknown to anyone outside of Kaiserslautern and he has played fewer than 30 games for them. But he has provided one of Germany's missing links. He takes up good positions, is good in the air and always looking to get on the end of crosses. When you consider that Germany are without quite a few top-class players, his efforts have been excellent. Another who could end up as the tournament's top scorer, which would put another million or so on his price.
