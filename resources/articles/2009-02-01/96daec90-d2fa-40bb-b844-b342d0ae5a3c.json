It will be open every Saturday and Sunday from 10.00 till 18.00 and every Friday from 18.30 till 21.00 from tomorrow until 29 March. I like the part in the press release about what happens next: The winning designs are being passed to bus manufacturers, who will combine them with their expertise in bus design to develop proposals for the final design of the new bus. Still plenty of mileage in this saga. Have a good weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
