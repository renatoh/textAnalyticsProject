But South Oak Cliff high school in Dallas preferred another, more direct method: bare-knuckle fighting inside a steel cage. According to a 2008 report obtained by the Dallas Morning News, staff at the school sanctioned the use of \"the cage\" - a section of the boys' changing room barricaded by wire mesh and steel lockers - to settle disputes and bring unruly students under control. In one incident, according to the report compiled by the local school district, the school principal at the time, Donald Moten, told staff to place two fighting pupils, \"in the cage and let 'em duke it out\". On another occasion, according to the report, a member of the school's security staff tried to fight a student in the cage, but the principal intervened. The incidents are alleged to have taken place between 2003 and 2005. According to the report, the principal, school security staff and other employees, \"knew of the practice, allowed it to go on for a time, and failed to report it\". Frank Hammond, a counsellor at the school who was dismissed and has since filed a whistle-blower lawsuit, said: \"It was gladiator-style entertainment for the staff. They were taking these boys downstairs to fight. And it was sanctioned by the principal and security.\" Moten, who resigned last year following a separate investigation, denied that any cage fights took place during his tenure. \"That's barbaric,\" he told the paper. \"You can't do that at a high school. You can't do that anywhere. Ain't nothing to comment on. It never did happen. I never put a stop to anything because it never happened.\" However the school district superintendent, Michael Hinojosa, agreed that \"some things that happened inside of a cage\" were \"unacceptable\", and said that the school had been turned around under a new principal. No criminal charges were filed, he said, although disciplinary action was taken. South Oak Cliff high school, known as \"sock\", opened in 1952 and currently has 1,500 pupils."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
