The president granted a two-week reprieve to up to 2,000 families who were due to be targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents, following a request from Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives. But Trump said in a tweet on Sunday the raids would go ahead later this month if Democrats did not allow him to tighten laws to make it more difficult for people to claim asylum in the US. \u201cProbably won\u2019t happen, but worth a try,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTwo weeks and big Deportation begins!\u201d While activists expressed relief at the passing of immediate danger, many condemned Trump\u2019s casual handling of a decision that could lead to migrant parents being taken from children born in the US. \u201cThis is all a game to him while people live in deep fear,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \u201cHuman beings as political pawns.\u201d The raids were expected on Sunday in major cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. Some city authorities had said they would not cooperate. Mark Morgan, acting director of Ice, said the agency would target families that had already received a removal order from an immigration court. Pelosi said in a tweet that while the delay was welcomed, \u201ctime is needed for comprehensive immigration reform\u201d. Trump\u2019s climbdown followed threats from Democrats in Congress to withhold $4.5bn in funding for law enforcement and humanitarian aid at the US-Mexican border, where there has been a surge in migrant arrivals. Many are fleeing violence in Central America. The president, whose 2016 campaign was built around the demonisation of migrants and a promise to build a wall along the entire southern border, has been enraged by the increase in illegal border crossings, which reached a 13-year high of more than 144,000 last month. Trump has repeatedly railed against US immigration laws for preventing him from simply blocking unwanted people and from immediately deporting people found to be in the US without authorisation. He frequently describes longstanding law allowing migrants to declare they are refugees and attempt to claim asylum as a \u201cloophole\u201d needing to be closed. The United Nations protocol on refugees, to which the US was already a signatory, was incorporated into American law by the US Refugee Act of 1980. Republican allies of Trump in Congress have proposed an overhaul of immigration law that would force migrants to claim asylum from their own country or Mexico, a plan widely derided by human rights groups and immigrant activists. Horrifying stories have meanwhile emerged from camps near the border packed with migrants, including young children. A Trump administration lawyer argued in court last week that detained children did not require soap or toothbrushes to be held in \u201csafe and sanitary\u201d conditions, and could be made to sleep on cold concrete floors. Asked about the conditions facing migrant children, during an interview with NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that was broadcast on Sunday, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.\u201d That claim was echoed by Vice-President Mike Pence, in interviews with CNN and CBS. The debate over how to deal with an influx of largely Hispanic migrants has unfolded against a backdrop of racial panic among some devotees of Trump, whose \u201cbase\u201d of support skews towards older white Americans in rural areas. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican, came under fire for posting a tweet on Saturday linking to a news article on how his state \u201cgained almost nine Hispanic residents for every additional white resident last year\u201d. Activists and community leaders said over the weekend Trump\u2019s delay of the Ice raids put them in an all-too-familiar position. \u201cHe\u2019s done this before,\u201d Father Richard Smith, a San Francisco clergy leader and immigration activist, told the Guardian. \u201cPart of his strategy clearly is to incite fear among a vulnerable community that is already in fear. It\u2019s death by a thousand cuts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
