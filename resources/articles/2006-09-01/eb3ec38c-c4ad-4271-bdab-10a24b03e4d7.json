The injury happened after an innocuous challenge in Bayern Munich's 2-1 defeat by Arminia Bielefeld on Saturday. The midfielder hobbled off midway through the first half but the club say they suspect Hargreaves has fractured his left fibula. 'He will need tests back in Munich before there is a clear idea of the extent of the injury', read a statement on Bayern Munich's official website. Bayern recently rejected a bid from Manchester United for Hargreaves, who had said he was keen on a move to England. The holding midfielder was one of the few England players to impress in the World Cup and he has since taken possession of former England captain David Beckham's No7 jersey. However, Hargreaves could now miss England's next two European championship Group E qualifiers at home to Macedonia on October 7 and away to Croatia on October 11."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
