Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderon, born to a Hungarian-Jewish father and a mother of Spanish and Mexican Indian descent. When and where? 1907, in Coyoacan, then a town on the outskirts of Mexico City, since swallowed up by the metropolis. What? She started off studying medicine but after a crippling traffic accident turned to painting. Her pictures, many of them self-portraits and described by some as surrealist, often centre on the pain and suffering of women. She died in 1954. Got it - the one in that dreadful movie with Salma Hayek. Yup, that's the one. Lady with a 'tache and a monobrow. But of course, that's not the most important thing about her. She was one of the most significant artists of the 20th century. Her iconic self-portraits, unrivalled in their poignant beauty, depict both Kahlo's isolation and also her indomitable spirit and sense of self. Who says? The Tate Modern guide, where a show of her work opens on Thursday. Ah, so that's why we're doing her. What else? Because of her preoccuption with female themes, she also became a feminist icon. Madonna feels that Kahlo reflects her pain. Big job that, I'd have thought. Anyway, didn't she go out with somebody famous? Trotsky, almost certainly, who died in Mexico City. Oh, him. Communist. Ice pick. That's the one. She was also married to the artist Diego Rivera, of whom she once said, \"I suffered two grave accidents in my life. One involved a bus, the other is Diego.\" She could have made that three, in fact, because she married Rivera twice. It was what is often termed a \"tempestuous\" relationship. Why did Diego Rivera hit Frida over the head with a bottle? Tequila. Boom boom. Not to be confused with: Frida the tortoise who used to be on Blue Peter, Tom Selleck, Chewbacca the Wookie."}, "isHosted": false}}}
