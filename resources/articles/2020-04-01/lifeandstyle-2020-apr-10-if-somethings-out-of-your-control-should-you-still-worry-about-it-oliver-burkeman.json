In every situation, there are things we can control and things we can\u2019t, and struggling to control the latter is a recipe for anxiety and stress. \u201cPartial control\u201d, like the kind I have over my three-year-old\u2019s behaviour, can be broken down into the two: I usually have total control over what I say or do; and none, technically, over how he reacts. It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s echoed widely elsewhere, for example in the Serenity Prayer, associated with Alcoholics Anonymous, and in an observation with Buddhist origins: if a problem can be fixed, there\u2019s no need to worry about it; and if it can\u2019t be fixed, well, why bother worrying? Which is fine so far as it goes: it\u2019s surely true that if I could manage never to fret about things I can\u2019t affect, then life would proceed serenely. But it strikes me as a major weakness of Stoicism \u2013 at least in its rediscovered, newly fashionable form \u2013 to assume that seeing the truth in an insight like this can bring peace of mind by itself. Among the many things I can\u2019t control, it turns out, are my own emotions. What Sigmund Freud and his successors brought to psychology was the understanding that conscious thought might be only a tiny sliver of what\u2019s going on in the mind as a whole. So if a global pandemic triggers my particular anxieties around death, or illness, or job security \u2013 anxieties formed over decades, and embedded in my unconscious \u2013 it\u2019s radically insufficient to try to think myself into realising they\u2019re futile. If pointlessness caused things to vanish, PopSockets that people stick on the backs of their phones wouldn\u2019t exist. Yet they do. That\u2019s why, in my experience, the dichotomy of control is best approached as a preliminary tool. You use it to distinguish what you can control from what you can\u2019t \u2013 but peace of mind arrives only when you begin taking action in the realm of the former. (As the saying goes, you can\u2019t think yourself into new ways of acting, but you can act yourself into new ways of thinking.) It\u2019s often less a matter of realising how little control you have than how much. You can\u2019t stop the worldwide spread of a disease, but you can do plenty to stop it spreading through you. You can\u2019t choose physical fitness, but you can choose to eat well, and to move. You can\u2019t choose to make it through today\u2019s to-do list, but you can choose to spend the next three hours diligently attacking it. And so on. There\u2019s a deep kind of freedom to be found here, even in the presence of severe external constraints. Your goals shift from external ones, about imposing certain changes on the world, to internal ones, about how you plan to act upon the world. These are objectives you can aim at wholeheartedly, fully expecting to accomplish \u2013 secure in the knowledge that they don\u2019t require the cooperation of forces whose assistance you\u2019re in no position to compel.
