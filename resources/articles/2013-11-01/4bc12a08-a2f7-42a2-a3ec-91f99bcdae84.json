There's a lot to talk about. There's the brilliant green of close-cropped grassland and the tidy hedges of tourist brochure England. And there is the environmental impact of so much human intervention on a landscape. There are the golden grain plains of the east and the value of those regular hectares of weed-free, lifeless barley and the hundreds of cattle it will one day feed. And there's the cost of finding horse in your burger again. And over the grey Cumbrian fells hovers the question: might the barren landscape be more ecologically diverse with more scrub and fewer sheep? Unusually, the environment secretary Owen Paterson would like everyone to think about it too, although possibly not in these terms. The government is consulting on the new common agricultural policy (as it applies in England; the other UK regions are autonomous), thrashed out in Brussels over the past year and due to be introduced incrementally from the start of 2014. The best thing to say about the new CAP budget is that it will be smaller than it was, a mere third or so of the total EU budget, where once it was four-fifths. Handsome all the same, when farming accounts for less than 3% of EU output, and employs only one in 20 of its citizens. Scale those figures back even further for the UK where agriculture is now only less than half a percent of national output and employment. The CAP has always served a much wider purpose than making post-war Europe self-sufficient in food. For more than 60 years it has entrenched a conservative rural hierarchy by inflating land values while distorting agricultural priorities at home and global trade abroad. Even now, its per-hectare payment scheme enriches the large landowner and supports an agricultural monoculture. There was plenty of scope for reform. Sadly, the new scheme looks remarkably like the old . So registered landowners will continue to receive around \u00a3200 a hectare in direct payments, regardless of what they grow, although some will be linked to how they grow it. There'll be new \"greening\" requirements, although environmentalists fear they are not stringent enough to preserve the gains made in the past 20 years of more clearly defined agri-environment schemes (which gave us broad headlands and shaggy hedges). More of England's \u00a32bn than before will go to a separate rural development budget: how much more, Mr Paterson says, is out for consultation. He wants it to be the maximum 15%. Since that is the only way to direct more money into the environment, that's where campaigners such as the RSPB want it to go, too. The real fight will be over how the extra cash is divided up \u2013 on schemes to protect habitats and restore degraded environments, or on projects to enhance agricultural competitiveness. This is the government that closed down the agricultural wages council, which for more than a hundred years offered some protection to the men and women who rise at dawn to pick daffodils in icy Cornish fields or spring onions in Worcestershire so we can have cheaper flowers and vegetables. This is fine as far as it goes, but it's not far enough. Well-designed environmental schemes can make the difference between survival and extinction for some species \u2013 think stone curlew, or the turtle dove that cannot breed successfully without weedy field margins to feed on \u2013 but the cost of a vanished bird or an increasingly rare vole is an incalculable negative that has no place on a farmer's balance sheet. It's time to spread the deeper argument about how we value food and landscape that escapes too rarely from academic economics departments. There are many ways of costing what we put on the table or treasure in the countryside. But it is futile to suppose that they don't all, in some way or another, involve cash."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
