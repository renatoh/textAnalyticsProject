For the past six weeks, images of other people\u2019s summer reading stacks have been popping up on every social media site I have been trying hard to stay away from. From Sally Rooney\u2019s Normal People to Gerald Murnane\u2019s Border Districts, my feed is full of artfully arranged and achingly worthy titles stacked on bedside tables and spread across beach towels. Yes, I know. This is the summer you will finally read The Sorrows of Young Werther. You are going to set aside a good 12 hours to break the back of Ulysses, only stopping for water and power naps, before charging head first into Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s series, My Struggle. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In fact, you will set your holiday alarm for 4am to read James Joyce\u2019s complete works, and if you cut out family barbecues, food and the broad notion of fun, you could even make a decent dent in the other modernists as well. You will apply a rigour and a thoroughness to your reading stack that has been entirely absent from your job for the past 12 months. You see, the summer book stack is not some light and airy thing. It is a repository of scholarship, it heaves with knowledge and gravitas, and it requires artful consideration. In the past, I have been as guilty as the next person of carefully curating a book stack selection that would speak volumes about my literary sophistication, while also hinting at a plugged-in, socially aware side. I tweeted about the worthy reads, but kept the page-turners and Jungian books (yes, honestly) firmly out of the picture. I read thrillers at a steady clip \u2014 some good, some woeful \u2014 but only discussed with friends the more serious books I was reading. As my reading life has increasingly been divided into three distinct streams \u2014 the books I am paid to read as a reviewer, the books I read to escape, and the literary fiction I enjoy and admire \u2014 I began to wonder why our book stacks do not reflect our diverse and complex reading habits. Why are we talking about reading a small and homogenous collection of literary works when our actual reading lists are much more diverse? So I did some hunting. I Googled \u201cbest-selling books of 2018\u201d and then I searched my friends\u2019 homes \u2014 peaking in their drawers and lifting up their mattresses \u2014 and discovered that things are actually much worse than I thought. The only book anyone is apparently reading in Australia at the moment is Scott Pape\u2019s The Barefoot Investor: The Only Money Guide You\u2019ll Ever Need. One in every 20 households reportedly has a copy, but they are curiously absent from the #summerreadingstack posts on my social media feeds. So, a nation of diverse readers we are not. But one of the wonderful things about getting older is that we no longer have to care about reading the right kind of books all of the time, or what the cool kids think. Surely, during our summer reading, we can loosen our belts, indulge our whims and absorb a good page-turner, without needing to be seen as modish? And it\u2019s not purely a question of quality either. As someone who has reviewed a wide array of books, I can report back with a degree of authority that terrible writers do not confine their efforts to popular fiction, but also like to exercise their mediocrity across a range of genres, from memoir to literary fiction, to self-help hogwash (not that there is anything wrong with that). So if you are reading Scott Pape, that\u2019s OK. If you got distracted from your literary reading list by a dog-eared copy of The Thorn Birds in your Airbnb summer rental, then embrace it. And if you genuinely want to spend your summer reading Ulysses, well, just don\u2019t tell the rest of Australia how it ends. \u2022 Johanna Leggatt is a Melbourne-based journalist and book reviewer"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
