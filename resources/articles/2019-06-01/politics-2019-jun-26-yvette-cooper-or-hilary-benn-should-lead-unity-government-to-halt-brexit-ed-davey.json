The Lib Dem contender admitted he had not spoken to Cooper or Benn about the plan and said the unity government\u2019s sole purpose would be to oversee a second referendum and then dissolve parliament and hold a general election. Davey said the plan would \u201ctake some persuasion\u201d but could be a way to attract Conservatives to vote down their own government if they were wary of their actions leading to Jeremy Corbyn winning an election. Cooper, who has been at the forefront of cross-party efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit, has never endorsed a second referendum. Speaking to journalists at a hustings with his Lib Dem leadership rival Jo Swinson, Davey said it was an \u201cextreme option\u201d and said he had not done the numbers. \u201cI think it has to be a Labour MP because most MPs supporting the Queen\u2019s speech in this government of national unity would be Labour. Ultimately, it\u2019s a challenge to my Labour colleagues,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve not held talks, I\u2019ve not done a tally. The last time we held an indicative vote for a people\u2019s vote we had 280 people voting for that. I\u2019m as confident as I can be there are six cabinet ministers who would have voted for that, as well as junior ministers. We would need some Tories to come over \u2026 I think they are there.\u201d During the hustings, both Swinson and Davey said they were confident about the possibility of new MPs joining the party, after Chuka Umunna joined the Lib Dems. \u201cI have and will continue to have private conversations,\u201d Swinson said. \u201cI\u2019m keen to grow the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party in a variety of ways.\u201d Davey named Heidi Allen, the former Tory MP who briefly joined and then left Change UK, as one MP he had been in talks with. \u201cI have talked to Heidi, I am very happy for them to join, and having listened to them and heard their positions on Europe and other issues, they would fit well in our party,\u201d he said of Allen and of her former Change UK and Tory colleague Sarah Wollaston. \u201cWe have to show we are a successful party really going places, they can afford to join us and hold their seats, then we can see quite a lot of people going our way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
