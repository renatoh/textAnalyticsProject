Heading one way was Aly Wagner, heading the other was Tom Hicks, two disparate characters in the vast landscape of American sport who have faced up to the future and want it to be less inhospitable than it threatens to be. For Aly, a reserve midfielder for the Los Angeles Sol, one of seven teams in the newly founded Women's Professional Soccer league, that means embracing the social phenomenon du jour. Last Saturday, she became the first ever professional player to \"tweet\" during a game. (Technology note: ask your monosyllabic cousin, the one who is never without his BlackBerry.) At this stage in the Twitter phenomenon, which reached its sporting nadir when Lance Armstrong used the forum in a nauseating effort to transform himself into a good-humoured everyman, there will be plenty who are inclined to poke fun at the idea of Wagner sending mid-match text messages to the world, warming up her index fingers when she should have been warming up her hamstrings. God knows, she didn't give much in the way of insight from her view on the bench \u2013 \"Game on; I'm nervous; Can't eat my sandwich that I made 'n' brought; Wooooohooooooo!!!! How bout the second goal!!!!\" \u2013 but consider for a minute the economic climate facing the WPS league as it starts its new life. Consider also the cravings of the average fan for a connection, even of the most rudimentary kind, with those whom they follow, and the question suddenly changes from \"why bother?\" to \"why not?\" If this puzzles those who haven't heard of WPS, far less formed an affinity for it, then perhaps they would feel differently if, say, they were a Manchester United fan and Carlos Tevez started tweeting from the bench \u2013 \"Sub again! WTF?; Can't eat my sandwich cuz Berbatov makes me sick; Wish I'd stayed @ Hammers.\" Meanwhile, as Wagner sat on the bench, texting while she waited for the nod from her manager \u2013 it never came, incidentally \u2013 Hicks sat in his office, awaiting calls from those interested in his offer, announced a couple of days earlier, to sell 49% of his 95% stake in the Texas Rangers. On this side of the Atlantic, Hicks's decision was seen in the context of strengthening his Liverpool ownership, but in the States it was judged as proof, as if any more were needed, that things really are as bad as they seem. In recent months, the multibillion sporting dollar citadels have all been breached. The NFL has laid off almost 200 employees while its commissioner, Roger Goodell, has taken a 20% pay cut. In basketball, the NBA has reportedly given low-interest loans to 12 teams in financial difficulties. The US Olympic Committee fired more than 10% of its staff. Baseball is poised to start its new season amid fears that attendances are about to collapse, with calamitous effects on the weakest teams, such as the Texas Rangers. This prospect left Hicks with a dilemma: weather the storm with America's national pastime, or take his chances with the English Premier League. To a man such as Hicks, there really was no choice. \"It is just a way to be prudent in a bad economy,\" said the irony-challenged king of the leveraged buyout, whose lack of prudence has left Liverpool up the creek without a new stadium. It's a queasy thought but English football really should be flattered. In his desperation to sell a chunk of the Rangers, Hicks has confirmed what we already knew \u2013 the Premier League really is immune to economic reality as it applies to others. Give those players, those managers, those blessed marketing geniuses at Gloucester Place, a Queen's Award for Industry, although as we celebrate their financial triumph we should remember why it is the Premier League has grown ever more arrogant, and ever more distant from the ordinary supporter, and why it would never contemplate doing what Wagner did and tweeting the world from the substitutes' bench: because it is so rich it doesn't need to. Branson wins Australian grand prix (cheque, please) Maybe my eyes were deceiving me and the effervescent Richard Branson won last weekend's Australian grand prix. Certainly the bearded wonder was front and centre of the post-race celebrations. So I checked. Amazingly it turns out a fellow by the name of Jenson Button drove the Brawn GP car to a famous victory. Still Branson was the financial muscle behind this wondrous upset, the guardian angel who arrived down under at the last minute, showering the financially troubled Brawn F1 team with so much Virgin sponsorship money that it would be virtually impossible not to win. Certainly the tycoon and his energetic PR team left this impression. So I checked. Amazingly it turns out Branson's commitment to the Brawn team amounted to two races and \u00a3350,000 - not a piddling amount by everyday standards, certainly, but a piddling amount when measured against the financial value of the exposure the Virgin brand received for its investment, calculated at \u00a37.3m by SportsPro magazine. Still this is what irritating self-publicists do. They extract maximum personal glory from minimal personal risk. No checking necessary. Ruthless Murray moves on and up alongside Beckham If ruthlessness is the defining characteristic of the truly great champion, then Andy Murray is destined for a career laden with grand slam titles. The Scot, still 21, has a small core of friends and relations to whom he is relentlessly loyal. As for others who fall within his orbit, they may never know when the axe will fall, only that it will. Just ask Stuart Higgins, the \"media guru\" who, it was reported yesterday, will no longer be working on behalf of Murray. Presumably the services of a former Sun editor do not come cheaply but, viewed from the outside, it could be they were worth every penny Murray spent. Over the last couple of years the player's image, not to mention his attitude, has been transformed - a change for which Higgins deserves a great deal of credit. Henceforth Murray will be guided by 19, the show business agency that looks after David Beckham. No doubt his celebrity will grow and he will make a lot of money. But at what cost? Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, say yes or no but say it now In any argument between Colin Montgomerie and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal few people would readily take the Scotsman's side. It would be like choosing \"Rollin'\" by the Bay City Rollers over \"Sketches of Spain\" by Miles Davis. But as our two heroes go back and forth over Olaz\u00e1bal's acceptance (or possibly non-acceptance) of the vice-captaincy of Europe's Ryder Cup team, the only conclusion is that the Spaniard should grow up and accept the Scot's offer in the generous spirit in which it was made. There is surely no one left who cares who said what to whom and when."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
