The ANU chancellor, former foreign minister Julie Bishop, told Guardian Australia the move recognised \u201cthe disruption across the country and the differing responses that schools and education systems have been forced to make\u201d. Bishop also revealed the university was likely to miss out on the federal government\u2019s jobkeeper wage subsidy program, as its revenue exceeds $1bn and it would \u201cprobably\u201d suffer a decline in its turnover of 40%, short of the 50% threshold to qualify. Universities Australia, which is lobbying the education minister, Dan Tehan, for a separate support package, conservatively estimates that the sector will lose between $3bn and $4.6bn. On Wednesday University of Sydney revealed to its staff it was expecting to lose $470m this year. On Tuesday education ministers unanimously ruled out a \u201cyear 13\u201d for students currently in year 12 to complete their studies in 2021. It is now up to each state and territory how to modify the end-of-year assessments in their jurisdiction, while the commonwealth will work with the university and vocational education sectors to determine how Australian tertiary admission ranks (Atar) will be assessed. The national cabinet has relied on expert medical advice to resist a push to close schools, but most high school education has shifted online, with most states and territories moving school holidays or using pupil-free days to prepare for terms two and three being delivered through e-learning after the Easter break. Under the ANU plan, current year 12 students will be allowed to apply between April and 25 May, with a round of offers to be made in August. Bishop said about 3,000-3,500 offers would be made based on year 11 results \u2013 with no conditions except that the student finish year 12. \u201cThis will give those wanting to study at ANU next year certainty and hopefully remove much of the stress and anxiety that they are likely to experience undertaking year 12 studies this year, with all the disruption and challenges coronavirus has wreaked upon our education systems,\u201d she said. Bishop noted \u201cthe separate education systems across our states and territories are yet to determine how year 12 results and Atar will look\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell what year 12 will look like state to state. I don\u2019t think there are many easy options for federal, state or territory governments and it\u2019s going to be many months before we can judge the effectiveness of the approach we\u2019ve taken so far. \u201cSo we want to make an offer now, knowing year 12 students will experience a tough year in 2020.\u201d The ANU will later make a separate round of offers to students who rely on their year 12 Atar. Bishop said ANU had a \u201crobust balance sheet\u201d and was seeking to mitigate losses and prepare for various contingencies, and she hoped to keep as many staff as possible in jobs. On Tuesday the federal government made clear that universities \u2013 unlike charities \u2013 would still need to meet the threshold of 30% revenue reduction for organisations earning $1bn or less, and 50% for those above that threshold, to qualify for the jobkeeper scheme. Bishop said she was not in a position to say whether ANU would qualify for the $1,500 fortnightly wage subsidy for staff that have been stood down. \u201cWe might fall between \u2013 we\u2019re over $1bn, but we\u2019re probably about 40% [revenue decline].\u201d On Wednesday Tehan confirmed the government was looking at other measures to help the university sector, and would have more to say in the next few days. \u201cWe think there will probably be increased demand next year for university, so we are working with them to make sure that we can provide the foundations that they\u2019ll need to continue to be able to educate our children,\u201d Tehan said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
