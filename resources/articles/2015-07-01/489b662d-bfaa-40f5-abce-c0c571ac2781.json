Nurtured in a culture where boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 roles were clearly defined, I was grossly ill-prepared for my widowed fate. I suffered survivor guilt, struggling to understand why bad things happen to good people, struggling to understand why my life was spared when my daughters surely needed their mother more than me. Men suggested that I reach out for a new woman, for single parenting manuals, for cookbooks, for dating websites, for hired help, even for sleeping tablets and psychologists. Women offered to \u201cgive me a break\u201d and care for my children. \u201cThank you, but no thank you. They\u2019ve already been robbed of their mum. I can\u2019t do this to them.\u201d Instead of outsourcing, I reached deep within. I took my hat off to so many women raising their children alone, adapting to their new reality, many with admirable grace. Their children seemed well adapted. Why can\u2019t men do the same? Whoever gave women the capacity to perform full parental roles must have given the same to men. This was a fork in the road. But there was no way I was going to avoid the painful path to get closer to my daughters, and inadvertently closer to myself. So I began my emancipation. I used be minister of foreign affairs (garden, garbage, garage). Now my portfolio expanded to home affairs, ironically sometimes \u201cforeign\u201d to me. I burnt the wok, ruined \u201chand wash only\u201d garments, and bought the wrong sanitary pads. I felt like I was now jogging on one leg, from home to car to shop and kept telling myself: \u201cJust do it!\u201d Paradoxically, when I failed, when I felt weakest, I actually became my strongest. Something dormant within had awoken: the capacity to do anything and the plasticity of the brain to adapt. Like Uncle Martin (from US sitcom My Favourite Martian), I raised my antenna to full length to tune in to the rhythms and language of my daughters. For every \u201cbut you don\u2019t understand \u2026,\u201d I responded \u201cthen make me understand!\u201d Fast forward 12 years, and I realise that they made me understand my capacity to embrace full parenthood \u2013 not just fatherhood or motherhood. I swung my metaphoric sledge hammer to the rusty shackles around my ankles that defined masculinity \u2013 shackles that were more than a gender prism. They were a gender prison. Nine months ago, I penned a frivolous column on my emancipation, egging on my \u201cfellow man\u201d to embrace his inner self (not his feminine self). Today, my book What My Daughters Taught Me is born to tell the tale in all its gory glory. Some women I know vow to pass this book to their husbands \u201cin case anything should happen to me, and he needs to look after our children\u201d. But why wait until a tragedy dictates a steep learning curve? Why not enjoy the full fruits of parenting today? When we talk about the crisis of masculinity that defines many of our debates around domestic violence or marriage equality, we ought look beyond gender to the bigger picture: the crisis of personality. Boys need to be raised in a culture that expands their social vocabulary, where emotions are expressed rather than suppressed. In their book Man (Dis)connected: How Technology Has Sabotaged What it Means to be Male, Philip Zimbardo and Nikita D. Coulombe explore the \u201cmodern meltdown of manhood\u201d which they attribute to absent fathers and the male addiction to screen gadgets. They argue that this trend towards \u201cextreme escapism\u201d has led to socially stunted males who glean fulfilment from the virtual world rather than the real one. My children\u2019s development wasn\u2019t determined by the gender of their single parent, but by the quality of our love. Deep within, we\u2019re soft-wired by nurture, not hard-wired by nature, to be affectionate, to tell bedtime stories, to help with school assignments, to hold our children\u2019s hands when they are sleepless and sick. Men need not be relegated to the one with the wallet and car keys. Their definition of manhood and strength need not be a stubborn word that will not be broken, and a similarly stubborn reluctance to say sorry. On the contrary, such \u201cstrengths\u201d are often the cracks of fear. True strength is the capacity to adapt, to flex rather than break in the face of a cyclone like cancer. True strength is the capacity to speak and listen to the many languages of silence, of touch, of facial expression. When I was a social worker, many male clients would tell me, \u201cI love my children, but it comes out all wrong!\u201d Their fear and over-protectiveness comes out as anger and distrust. Many females believe their father is a benchmark for their future partner, for better or worse. My daughters remind me of little things I have said or done that are etched in their memory but erased from mine. What they chose to internalise may be different to what we amplify or repeat. While my choices resulted from circumstance, now I wish I\u2019d made the choice to remove my shackles long before.
