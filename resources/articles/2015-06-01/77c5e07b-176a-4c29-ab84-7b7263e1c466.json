Only two Premier League clubs meet the number of wheelchair spaces recommended in the Home Office guide to safety at sports grounds and one complaint about United is they do not sell season tickets to fans using disabled places. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is writing to the Premier League and United, demanding that they abide by the legal duty not to discriminate against disabled people, telling them \u201call options remain on the table.\u201d Lady Grey-Thompson, the Paralympic gold medal winner, said many disabled people had written to tell her about their bad experiences at football matches and described it as a \u201cmoral issue\u201d to make improvements. \u201cI am a bit tired of the same excuses being trotted out,\u201d she wrote in a blog . \u201c\u2018The stadiums are old\u2019 is used a lot and [I] have also been told that there isn\u2019t enough money. Really? Oh sorry, I forgot there isn\u2019t any money in football at this level.\u201d Rebecca Hilsenrath, the chief legal officer at the EHRC, a government-supported body mandated to challenge discrimination, said they have received complaints about experiences that include \u201cdiscriminatory policies that prevent disabled fans having the same opportunities to attend football matches as non-disabled people\u201d. These included a lack of adequate space for wheelchair users, problems for families with young disabled children being able to sit together and, most recently at United, the removal of walking aids from disabled away fans, she said. \u201cWe are writing to both the Premier League and to Manchester United today to seek urgent assurances that disabled fans will be treated fairly and equally as the law requires,\u201d Hilsenrath said. \u201cWe are also seeking urgent meetings with them to clear up the issues which have been identified and agree commitments to early progress. While our preference is always to work with organisations to avoid costly legal proceedings, all options remain on the table because disabled fans deserve better.\u201d The Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, said he agreed that the clubs need to improve their provision but complained that the letter from the EHRC was the first contact with the league since the election. \u201cThe clubs remain committed to identifying scope for improvement of disabled supporter access in their stadia,\u201d Scudamore said. \u201cIt was discussed again at yesterday\u2019s AGM, with an agreement to expedite this important project.\u201d A United spokesman said that Old Trafford offers some of the best facilities for disabled supporters in Europe, including an \u201cability suite\u201d with bespoke catering and accommodation for disabled people. \u201cAt each stage of the stadium\u2019s development, it has expanded in line with the guidelines in place at the time and with the full involvement of our own Disabled Supporters\u2019 Association,\u201d the spokesman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
