But just as they had red-carded their way into trouble in the first leg in the West Country, so they yellow-carded their way into a similar situation on their home turf in the Auvergne. One minute they were playing sublime rugby, overcoming with contemptuous ease Bath's 14-point cushion; the next, they were down to 13 players, facing Mike Catt at his very best and in danger of handing Bath the contest. Losing two players suggested that the referee had a part to play. He did. Donal Courtney of Ireland was that extra element, if any was needed, to a strange pair of games that had already managed to include just about everything rugby had to offer, the good, as well as the bad. The Irish referee for the first half let Montferrand get away with near-murder at the line-out. The home team had pinpointed this area as Bath's strength and simply took out the jumpers or their boosters illegally. The referee did nothing. Denied access to their best ball, Bath fumbled the ball everywhere else around the field in the first half. With their own specific mission accomplished, Montferrand purred into action and by the end of the first quarter were already in the lead on aggregate. Perhaps it just showed that Bath were not at their most motivated, since their route to the Heineken Cup next season has already been built through the Premiership. Montferrand, on the other hand, are having a dreadful domestic campaign and only through the Parker Pen can they qualify. The difference in appetite at this point was clear. The very best of the Montferrand players were their first two try scorers. Tony Marsh, now fully recovered from his cancer of last year and his injuries of this season, was majestic in the centre. He pounded his legs for the opening try from close range. From rather farther out, Pierre Mignoni ran in for the second try after the best Bath attack broke down near the Montferrand line. The Bath forwards looked up to see Mignoni scorching away. There was a brief exchange of penalties before a second try by Marsh - a more classical glide on the outside - seemed to seal the game. Twenty-five points clear at half-time, everything seemed settled, especially when the first scores of the second half were another penalty for the home team and another try, this one by Olivier Magne. Then came the two yellow cards, shown to Thibault Privat and, a few minutes later, to Elvis Vermeulen. Having let the Montferrand forwards get away with everything in the first half, the referee was now stinging them in the second. This coincided with the arrival on the field of Catt. He was at his very inventive best. How Bath could leave him out in the first place defies belief. Anyway, against weakened opposition Bath nearly pulled off the most unlikely of revivals. Isaac Fea'unati, Simon Danielli and Wylie Human all scored in the last quarter to bring Bath to within two points on aggregate. It was not quite as dramatic as it all sounds, such had been the gulf between Montferrand at their best and Bath on the day. But just as the first tie had had its own little drama, so this one also brewed into something very watchable. This semi-final had so much that was good, but also a whole heap of rugby's fairly miserable. And that, unfortunately, included the performance by the referee. Still, it was all part of the recipe that included every ingredient going.
