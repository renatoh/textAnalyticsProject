The risks include blocked \u201czombie\u201d budget savings measures and cost blowouts in the national disability insurance scheme. Although the $18bn of savings measures held up in the Senate has been reduced by a $6.3bn savings deal between the government and opposition, the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, has ruled out accepting the remaining $12bn which he said were unfair. The incoming government brief from the finance department warns of \u201ca significant fiscal challenge for the government\u201d. \u201cThe underlying cash deficit is expected to be $37.1bn in 2016-17, with forecast improvements to the fiscal position over the forward estimates subject to a number of risks,\u201d it said. The brief noted the government planned to achieve a 0.2% budget surplus by 2020-21 and to shrink payments as a proportion of GDP from 25.8% to 25.2% in that time. The \u201csignificant downside risks\u201d which might ruin the planned surplus included: The risk of a \u201csignificant negative economic shock\u201d Failure to pass $18bn of savings booked in the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook but still unlegislated because they are blocked in the Senate Growth in the number and package costs of clients of the NDIS Potential increased costs for defence operations, new drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and disaster relief The finance department also noted since 2009-10 deficit reductions \u201chave not been achieved at the pace of to the extent expected, largely related to downward revisions to revenue\u201d, in part due to \u201cthe impact of demand-driven programs\u201d. The omnibus savings deal between the Coalition and Labor includes a $500m cut to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, retains the clean energy supplement to welfare recipients but scraps a planned $1.4bn \u201cbaby bonus\u201d to some families on family tax benefit B. On Wednesday Bowen told Radio National there was no room for compromise on the remaining $12bn of blocked savings measures. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear and consistent about those,\u201d he said. Bowen said the 2014 budget measures were \u201cunfair\u201d including making unemployed people wait for the dole or making people work until 70 to get the pension. On Tuesday the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the deal meant the government had made \u201cimmediate and tangible headway in the 45th parliament towards balancing the budget\u201d. \u201cOf course there is more work to be done and the government will continue to work with all parties \u2026 to secure the passage of all the savings measures reflected in the budget,\u201d he said. On Wednesday cabinet minister Josh Frydenberg said the government had to work with Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers to pass savings \u201cbecause 89% of spending is tied to government legislation\u201d and only three governments since the second world war had control of the Senate. The finance department noted commonwealth government debt was projected to reach recent historic highs, both on a gross and net basis. In 2016-17, net debt for the Australian government is expected to be $326.1bn, or 18.9% of GDP."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
