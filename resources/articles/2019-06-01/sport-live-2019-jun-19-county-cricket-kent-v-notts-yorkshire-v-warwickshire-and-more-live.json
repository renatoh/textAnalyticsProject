Denly opened and batted at three during the final two Tests in the West Indies in February and failed to cement his place. On day three at Tunbridge Wells, however, he led Kent into a strong position against a Notts side in danger of being cut adrift at the bottom of Division One. The 33-year-old shared a third-wicket partnership of 152 either side of tea with Daniel Bell-Drummond (79). Denly\u2019s unbeaten 111 off 176 balls underpinned Kent\u2019s 277 for three, a lead of 319 when bad light intervened late in the day. The batsman reached his century off 147 balls after tea, an innings including 13 fours. It was his first since last August. Should he secure Ashes selection, he will surely regard this innings as the turning point in a disappointing summer which saw him omitted from England\u2019s World Cup squad at the last minute. Notts will be frustrated at letting a position of strength slip in reply to a first-innings 309. They were 207 for three late on day two and bowled out for 267 by the improving seam of Matt Milnes (five for 68). Seventh-placed Warwickshire, sandwiched between Kent and Notts towards the foot of the table, are involved in an enthralling low-scoring clash with Yorkshire at York. Yorkshire will begin day four on 178 for seven in their second innings, leading by 183. The locals could not have asked for a better finish to the first county fixture in the Minster city since 1890. The pitch may have slowed up across the three days so far, but there is still plenty of help on offer for seam and spin. Warwickshire started the day on 192 for five in their reply to 259, only to lose their last three wickets in six balls either side of lunch and concede a lead of five. Halifax-born new ball seamer Oliver Hannon-Dalby, a Yorkshire player until he left for Edgbaston in 2013, bounded in to add three wickets to his five in the first innings. Jeetan Patel took two late on to leave Yorkshire just the happier at present. Division Two leaders Lancashire completed a 10-wicket win at Derbyshire before lunch on day three, chasing a target of only two. The Red Rose\u2019s fourth win of 2019 was lit up by new ball duo James Anderson and Graham Onions. The pair combined to take 17 wickets in the match. \u201cThey were unplayable at times on that pitch, and if they went into the first Test as an opening bowling pair, I\u2019m sure Australia would struggle,\u201d said Lancashire teammate Liam Livingstone. While final-day rain thwarted a late Middlesex bid for victory over Glamorgan at Radlett, a stunning Ryan Higgins unbeaten 196 helped Gloucestershire (41 for three in their first-innings reply to Leicestershire\u2019s 487) seize a lead at 503 for six on day three at Grace Road. Gloucestershire opener and captain Chris Dent hit 176, sharing 318 for the sixth wicket with Higgins. Worcestershire (262 for six) and Sussex (255) are involved in a tight game after two days at Kidderminster. Division One York: Yorkshire 259 (SA Patterson 60, GS Ballance 54, O J Hannon-Dalby 5-76, CN Miles 4-44) &amp; 178-7; Warwickshire 254 (DP Sibley 67). Tunbridge Wells: Kent 309 (Z Crawley 111, G Stewart 59, J L Pattinson 6-73) &amp; 277-3 (JL Denly 111 no, DJ Bell-Drummond 79); Nottinghamshire 267 (CD Nash 67, SR Patel 52, ME Milnes 5-68). Division Two Kidderminster: Sussex 255 (BC Brown 80, CJ Jordan 52, WD Parnell 4-92); Worcestershire 262-6 (CJ Ferguson 56, MH Wessels 55, OB Cox 53 no). Grace Road: Leicestershire 487 (NJ Dexter 180, Mohammed Azad 137, CN Ackermann 56no, J Shaw 4-85); Gloucestershire 503-6 (RF Higgins 196no, CDJ Dent 176, BAC Howell 52). Result: Lancashire (236 &amp; 4-0) beat Derbyshire (153 &amp; 84) by 10 wickets. Result: Middlesex (410 &amp; 125-4) v Glamorgan (288) \u2013 match drawn. Graham\u2019s off on write-up duties and the day\u2019s roundup will appear here later. Joe Denly has posted a century off 147 balls with 13 fours for Kent, who are 243-2 and lead Notts by 284 at Tunbridge Wells. Daniel Bell-Drummond is also going well on 78. With everything going on in the world of international cricket, you kind of forget that Denly played in England\u2019s last Test against West Indies in St Lucia in February. This is his first ton since last August. Important runs for Joe Denly and Kent. He has an unbeaten 84 in the hosts\u2019 second-innings 202-2 against Nottinghamshire at Tunbridge Wells. He has shared 110 unbroken for the third wicket with Daniel Bell-Drummond (56). Denly, of course, opened the batting in England\u2019s last Test against West Indies in February, but has endured a frustrating summer, highlighted by a late World Cup omission. Kent lead by 246. Opinion is split on the balcony housing the media, scorers and analysts. There is no definite answer regarding who is on top in this one. Yorkshire are 96-3 and 101 in front a tea. They have my vote, but not by much. It just takes two wickets quickly after tea for that to change. They weren\u2019t able to get back on after the afternoon rain, so that result suits Glamorgan far better than Middlesex. They strengthen their position in second place in Division Two behind leaders Lancashire. That may change over the next few days if Sussex get a result at Worcestershire, but they should still be in the three promotion places at least heading into the next round of fixtures. Here, Yorkshire are 84-3, leading by 89. Adam Lyth has 31 and Jack Leaning three on his home ground. We approach tea. Proper outground cricket moment. Lyth pulls Hannon-Dalby for six over long-leg and into a garden separated by a 10-12 ft wall. So one of the ground staff gets his ladder and directs whoever owns the house to find the ball. We have our ball back. Yorkshire 58-2, leading by 63. Big wicket. Gary Ballance gone, and he falls to the former Yorkshire combination - caught Will Rhodes at first slip off Oliver Hannon-Dalby for 18. The hosts are 31-2, leading by 36. Hannon-Dalby has seven wickets in the match. Surprised we haven\u2019t seen Jeetan Patel yet, though. Much like this one at Clifton Park, which sees Yorkshire 27-1 in their second innings leading Warwickshire by 32, it looks an enthralling game at Kidderminster. Worcestershire are 106-3 replying to Sussex\u2019s 255. Chris Jordan has just removed Riki Wessels for 55. Jimmy Anderson and Graham Onions finished Lancashire\u2019s match against Derbyshire with combined match figures of 17-104, prompting Liam Livingstone to say: They were unplayable at times on that pitch, and if they went into the first Test Match as an opening bowling pair I\u2019m sure Australia would struggle. It\u2019s raining at Radlett. That surely puts the kibosh on Middlesex\u2019s chances of a victory over Glamorgan. 125-4, leading by 247 with less than two sessions remaining. Yorkshire are 8-1 at York having lost Will Fraine lbw to Oliver Hannon-Dalby. Sounded like there was bat involved. If not, he was stone dead playing across one. Warwickshire are all out for 254, losing their last three wickets in six balls either side of lunch. Jordan Thompson had Liam Norwell lbw and David Willey got Tim Ambrose caught at first slip after the break. Yorkshire lead by five. Interesting game ahead now. Quickly around the grounds. I realise they are underway in the afternoon at most venues, but we have only just taken lunch here at York. Division One Warwickshire 250-8 in their first innings, trailing Yorkshire by nine - Jonny Tattersall has just taken a fine one-handed catch diving to his left to remove Jeetan Patel, via inside-edge, off Jordan Thompson. Kent 19-1 in their second innings against Notts at Tunbridge Wells - hosts lead by 61, but they have lost Sean Dickson to James Pattinson early in their second innings. Division Two Leaders Lancashire beat Derbyshire by 10 wickets at the County Ground to secure their fourth win in seven matches this season - Jimmy Anderson nine wickets in the match, Graham Onions eight. Lancashire were chasing only two to win this morning, wrapping up a win inside three days. Worcestershire 14-2 in reply to Sussex\u2019s 255 all out at lunch in Kidderminster - six wickets fell during the second morning there. Gloucestershire 143-5 in reply to Leicestershire\u2019s 487 all out at Grace Road - Captain Chris Dent keeping the visitors afloat with an unbeaten 57, but loads of work still to do. Middlesex 91-3 in their second innings against Glamorgan on day four at Radlett - hosts have 65 overs to play with as they chase a fourth day victory. They lead by 213. Looks to have been an action-packed morning at Kidderminster, where Worcester are 14-2 replying to Sussex\u2019s 255 at lunch. Ollie Robinson with both wickets \u2013 Daryl Mitchell and Josh Dell. Chris Dent trying to keep his Gloucestershire side afloat at Leicester, but it\u2019s a sizeable task. He has 57 out of 141-5 in reply to 487. They need 338 to avoid the follow-on. Dent has Ryan Higgins for company at Grace Road. Another wicket here at York, Craig Miles gone for 27, driving Ben Coad to mid-off. Warwickshire, who are 236-7, trailing by 23, have Tim Ambrose and captain Jeetan Patel at the crease. Patel played for York in 2003 as an overseas player. Result in. Lancashire win by 10 wickets chasing two as Keaton Jennings squirts the first ball of their chase from Luis Reece wide of the slips. A fourth win for the Division Two leaders. Notts 267 all out, a deficit of 42 against Kent. Derbyshire have a lead of one but are all out. Graham Onions picked up the last couple to finish with a five-for. \u201cReckon we have enough lads?\u201d Here at York, Craig Miles is unbeaten on 14 alongside Tim Ambrose (21). Warwickshire are 218-6, trailing by 41, and it\u2019s chilly. Your blogger is safely tucked under a bobble hat. Summer cricket, hey! Oh Notts, Notts, Notts. 207-3 at Tunbridge Wells becomes 255-9. Wickets for Stewart, Mulder and Milnes. Crikey, that escalated quickly. Derbyshire are 67-8 and still 16 behind Lancashire, who will win that game in double quick time. Jimmy Anderson has taken three of four morning wickets, the other going to Saqib Mahmood. Here at York, David Willey has just got Sam Hain caught at second slip for 25. Warwickshire 201-6 with an over to go before the new ball is due. They trail by 58. My feeling is that it could be a bowler\u2019s day here at York. Muggy, overcast conditions. We\u2019re set to get underway. It\u2019s certainly not a day for the photographers, who will have to use their imagination. The 2,000 seater temporary stand is nowhere near full. If there are 200 sat on there I\u2019d be surprised. We will be starting at 12pm at York with 88 overs to be bowled in the day. At Tunbridge Wells, Notts are 243-6, trailing Kent by 66, having lost Samit Patel early on for 52. Tom Moores and James Pattinson are in the infancy of their innings. More frustration for winless Notts, who were 207-3 last night and threatening to throw away a commanding position. Sussex are 215-7 against Worcestershire at Kidderminster early on day two. They have lost Chris Jordan for 52 to Adam Finch this morning, but Ollie Robinson has come out and hit an unbeaten 20 off 15 balls with four fours. Ben Brown is unbeaten on 69 and continuing his impressive season. Glamorgan have been bowled out for 288, a deficit of 122 at Radlett. There are 91 overs left in the day. Can Middlesex pull a win out of the bag? Steven Finn finished with five wickets, while Tom Helm took the last wicket \u2013 Graham Wagg for 48. Over to you, Dawid Malan. Instead of a start at 11.30am here at York, there will be a further inspection then. It seems like we should be getting under way around the country pretty swiftly this morning after all, including here at York, where a 11.30am start has been pencilled in. Hello from York, where it\u2019s not a bad morning to be a duck. Rain has greeted us at Clifton Park, and I can safely say that we won\u2019t be starting day three on time despite the fact that it\u2019s not actually raining that hard at the moment. If you were playing in this, you wouldn\u2019t leave the field. Unfortunately, it\u2019s the overnight stuff which will hold us up. There is hope for plenty of play later on today, potentially from around lunchtime onwards. When we do resume, Warwickshire will be 192-5 in reply to 259. A fluctuating second day saw Yorkshire enjoy the better of the morning, Warwickshire the afternoon and Yorkshire the evening. I would, however, rather be in the Bears camp at this stage, especially with the rain. The best way a result can be achieved now is for a Yorkshire second-innings collapse. Elsewhere in Division One, Nottinghamshire are handily placed (208-4 in reply to 309) against Kent at the halfway point at Tunbridge Wells, their cause advanced through a series of useful contributions headed by Chris Nash\u2019s 67. Samit Patel is unbeaten on 42. Dropping down to Division Two, and Graham Onions claimed the headlines yesterday by taking his 700th career first-class wicket as leaders Lancashire moved into a winning position against Derbyshire at the County Ground. Derbyshire, trailing by 83 on first innings, crumbled to 19-4 in their second, including three for 36-year-old \u2018Bunny\u2019. Since moving from Durham at the start of last year, Onions has taken 82 first-class wickets in 18 and a bit matches for the Red Rose at 20.89 \u2013 80 of those have come in Championship cricket. There is every chance he will claim a few more in this fixture. Rain yesterday looks to have put paid to Middlesex\u2019s chances of beating Glamorgan at Radlett unless they can pull a rabbit out of the hat on day four. That game is a day further advanced than the majority of others in play around the country. Glamorgan are 136 runs behind with one first-innings wicket remaining. Gloucestershire are 41-3 in reply to Leicestershire\u2019s 487 after two days at Grace Road. Australian seamer Chadd Sayers claimed three wickets for the visitors and on-loan Yorkshire quick Josh Shaw four. For Leicester, Muhammad Abbas has taken all three. And finally, another game out of sync day wise is at Kidderminster, where Sussex ended a rain-affected day one against Worcestershire on 185-6. Wayne Parnell took four-for."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
