The CCRC is looking into extraordinary accusations that Ms Dando's killing was linked to former Conservative party chairman Jeffrey Archer. The Daily Mirror today printed allegations made by George's supporters that Ms Dando died after her killer mistook her for Angela Peppiatt, Lord Archer's former secretary and the woman whose evidence sent the Tory peer to jail for perjury four years ago. Lawyers and friends of George, serving life for the 1999 murder of the Crimewatch presenter, have always argued his innocence. Today the CCRC, the body that investigates miscarriages of justice in the UK, confirmed that a member of the George legal team had claimed Ms Dando had died after being mistaken for Ms Peppiatt. The commission said it was undertaking a \"substantive\" review of allegations relating to the case. \"A man working on the Barry George campaign wrote to us a few weeks ago and formally asked us to look into the issue,\" said a CCRC spokesman. A case worker, with access to a legal adviser and an investigator, is looking at the allegations, which could \"take months,\" the legal body confirmed. \"The way it works is that if an application comes in we have to review it. We have to at least check out the applicant's arguments and what the issues are if they are within reason.\" The allegations concerning Lord Archer are currently at Stage 2 in the commission's investigative process, he said. Initial applications are vetted by a legal team at what is known as Stage O, before passing through stage 1 then 2 to 3, where a decision is taken whether the case should be referred to the court of appeal. \"We are investigating all sorts of aspects of the Barry George case. There's a lot of paperwork and a range of issues to be considered, although none has resulted in a referral so far,\" said the spokesman. \"There's a lot of work to do. We have been working on a substantive review for some months.\" In a full-page article headlined \"Was Jill Dando killed by mistake... by a hitman hired by Jeffrey Archer?\", the Mirror reported allegations that Ms Dando died after being mistaken by a gunman intent on killing Ms Peppiatt. \"Angela Peppiatt lived in the same West London area as Dando, looks very similar and even drove the same kind of BMW car as her,\" the article claimed. Ms Peppiatt's evidence - that Lord Archer doctored his diaries to create a false alibi to win \u00a3500,000 in damages against the Daily Star after it accused him of sleeping with a prostitute in 1987 - helped convict the Tory peer in 2001. In March Mary Archer, speaking on behalf of her husband, said: \"I have long known false allegations were made to the police to assist the prosecution and undermine Jeffrey's defence. I am astonished that the police did not make known to us, as the law requires they should have done, the preposterous claim that Jeffrey commissioned the murder of Angela Peppiatt.\" The CCRC spokesman added: \"Although we are obliged to look into issues were there may have been a miscarriage of justice, that doesn't mean that it has any credence.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
