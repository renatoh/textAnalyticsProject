David Hooley Jack Schofield replies: There are two main ways to do this. The most common is to use a copying or file compression or backup program that is capable of \"disk spanning\". Such programs will split one large file across many floppies or other types of disk, usually putting an index on the last one. Disk Span 3 is an example of a free disk-spanning utility. Many programs that compress files to make them smaller are also capable of disk spanning. Examples range from PK Zip (PZ204G.EXE) for DOS to WinZip 8. UltimateZip does splitting and spanning and is free. The alternative is to start by dividing the file into chunks, then copy each chunk on to a separate floppy. Again, there are lots of programs that will divide and recombine files, including WinSplit. See http://masl.to/?L2CA12CC2 for examples. HJ Split is probably the most common, because it is popular for splitting movies into sections. However, while better than nothing, floppy disks are not the best way to back up large files. If just one floppy goes wrong then you have lost the whole archive. If your file fills 10 to 100 floppies, the chances of one going wrong are too high to have real confidence in a single backup copy. It would be better to copy the file on to a CD-R disc in standard CD-ROM or CD-ROM XA mode (ie not using \"packet writing\" software that treats the CD as a floppy or hard drive). If you cannot fit an internal CD-R to your PC, you could buy one that works via a USB port, or possibly borrow one from a friend. Hide it I may seem paranoid, but I do a lot of business by email, and I want to be sure that my emails can only be read by the people who are meant to see them. Can you suggest an encryption product that won't break the bank but will give me some peace of mind? Don Smith JS: Several mail programs offer built in encryption, including Outlook Express, Netscape Communicator and Pegasus. In Outlook Express, write your email and then select Tools|Encrypt from the menu. However, this will not work unless you have already signed up for a digital ID. If you create emails or contracts separately and then send them as attachments, you can password protect the files instead. Microsoft Office XP has built-in encryption so you could protect a Word file by going to Tools|Options, then clicking the Security tab. Alternatively, you can easily protect any file by compressing it and specifying a password that must be used to expand it. You can do this with WinZip or any similar program, but your recipients will need compatible software to unzip the files. This may well make your emails less convenient to read and could put some customers off. Switch off Since upgrading Outlook Express we have been unable to switch identities between email accounts, although we can access them by going through Manage Identities and altering the opening up identity. Geoff Feld JS: This is a known bug, introduced with the Service Pack 1 update. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 329084: You Cannot Switch Identities in Outlook Express After You Install Windows XP SP1 (search Google for Q329084). As you have found, the workaround is to get Outlook Express to prompt you to select an identity when you run it. This means you have to restart OE to change to another identity. Presumably the bug will be fixed when Microsoft gets around to it. Accent it How can I type French accents in Outlook Express? The usual Word rules don't work when composing, but accents are correctly shown on incoming mail. Peter Wood JS: You should be able to enter accented characters using the ANSI character set, by holding down the Alt key and entering the appropriate numbers. It is best to do this using the numeric keypad, but Num Lock must be on. For example, to enter an e acute, hold down the Alt key, type 0233 on the numeric keypad, then release the Alt key. Fingertip Software has a useful table of ANSI codes at www.fingertipsoft.com/3dkbd/ansitable.html, but you must remember to add a zero to the start of each code. Alternatively you could use the Windows Character Map. If this is installed, you should find it at Start|Programs|Accessories|System Tools. When you select a character on the Character Map, it will tell you the Alt code, or the special key combination used to enter a character. (For example, you can enter e acute in Outlook Express by pressing Ctrl-Alt-E.) Outlook Express and other mail programs also support 3-digit ASCII codes, so yet another way to enter e acute is to hold down Alt and type 130. See www.arches.uga.edu/faq/accents.html for some common codes. However, bear in mind that the internet was designed to transfer 7-bit American text and what you send may not always appear correctly at the other end. Backchat \u00b7 Last week, Jack Hemens asked about firewalls for Macs. My reply neglected to mention that Mac OS X - where the operating system is actually a BSD version of Unix - has a firewall built in. Andrew Benschop, Steve Haunch and Matthew Henson add that the latest OS X version 10.2 (Jaguar) includes a graphical screen under System Preferences to enable Mac users to configure it. This supersedes the information given on the websites I recommended. \u00b7 Partition Magic software lets you change your hard drive layout, as mentioned last week. Barry Newton and David Williams have reminded me that Partition Magic includes Magic Mover software to move applications between drives. Well, it used to, but it has disappeared from recent versions. Colin Leeds suggests Partition Resizer as a free alternative to Partition Magic but adds: \"It is essential that the instructions are followed and as always it's a good idea to read the FAQs first.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
