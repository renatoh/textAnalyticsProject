Setting the legally binding target, which has wide political support, will be the easy bit. But the scale of transformation needed to meet the target is enormous. By 2050, petrol and diesel cars should be a distant memory, ideally banned from sale in favour of electric vehicles two decades earlier. \u201c2030 would be my ideal switchover date, but we have said 2035 at the latest to be cautious,\u201d said Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC. The current date is 2040, but switching sooner will save people money, he said, as electric cars are cheaper in the long run. The cars will need a lot of electricity, meaning clean power generation must quadruple by 2050, the CCC said. That certainly means more offshore windfarms, but the cheapest option \u2013 onshore windfarms \u2013 are effectively banned in England. Big storage will also be needed, but battery costs are plummeting. Homes heated by natural gas will also be long gone, with the CCC saying no new home should be connected to the gas grid after 2025. Electrified heating will be more common, but hydrogen could be an alternative to natural gas, if it can be produced cleanly at scale. Meat has a heavy environmental impact, but the CCC envisages only a 20% cut in beef, lamb and dairy consumption in 2050, far lower than in other studies and the 86% cut needed to meet UK health guidelines. \u201cWe absolutely don\u2019t think there would be support for that [huge cut], or that it is necessary,\u201d said Stark. \u201cA 20% cut seems cautious and prudent to us, but it is true that if you were to shift more to plant-based diets, the [net-zero] target would be easier overall.\u201d The UK landscape will also significantly change by 2050, if emissions are stopped. A fifth of all farmland \u2013 15% of land \u2013 will have been converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops. This is essential because some activities, like cattle rearing and aviation, will still emit greenhouses gases in 2050. The CCC target is for \u201cnet zero\u201d, with these residual emissions cancelled out by taking carbon out of the air. New trees are the simplest solution but tree planting must triple from today\u2019s rate, the CCC said, meaning more than 107 hectares (267 acres) a day of new forests from now until 2050. That would be 1.5bn trees, according to Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Woodland Trust, who said new woods would also help reverse huge losses of wildlife in the UK: \u201cThere is a potential win-win here.\u201d Guy Smith, at the National Farmers Union, said it was working towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by 2040. Activity in the North Sea should also switch from pumping up carbon in oil and gas to piping down CO2 for burial. The CCC said carbon capture and storage (CCS) was \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d to hitting zero emissions. However, the government cancelled a pioneering \u00a31bn CCS competition in 2015 and has yet to establish a major new initiative, despite the potential world-leading role the UK could play. Flying is included in the net zero target of the CCC, which said there could be a limited expansion of aviation if airlines can cut their emissions per flight, potentially with electric planes for short-haul flights. A few nuclear power stations may still be running, if they can compete on cost, though they are not necessary to meet the target, the CCC said. \u201cFracking is largely an irrelevance,\u201d added Dr Rob Gross, from Imperial College London. \u201cBut a massive expansion of renewables is perfectly feasible, particularly offshore.\u201d With Brexit perhaps another distant memory in 2050, the UK will need greater links with the continent when it comes to power. \u201cThe biggest challenge is making good use of this cheap low-carbon power,\u201d said Gross. \u201cThat means storing some as hydrogen and a lot more interconnection \u2013 it will be essential to share resources with our neighbours in the rest of Europe.\u201d All these changes would provide new types of jobs for people. The UK is a world leader in offshore wind and technologies such as CCS could also become important industries for the UK. \u201cWe started the [first] industrial revolution and we have an opportunity of leading the new industrial revolution, based on a sustainable economy,\u201d said Lord Deben, the chair of the CCC. \u201cWe will make money as a nation if we do it properly.\u201d The nation would be healthier too, according to the CCC. Air pollution would fall as fossil fuel burning ends, while more walking and cycling and less meat-eating would cut the damage to people\u2019s health. Furthermore, if the world\u2019s nations follow the UK\u2019s zero emissions lead and global warming is limited to well below 2C, the impacts of heatwaves, floods and storms will be much lower. \u201cThe only way to stabilise the climate is to achieve net zero emissions,\u201d said Prof Simon Lewis at University College London. \u201c[The CCC] shows that it is possible. The question now is if the political will is there to take on the vested interests that will try to stop it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
