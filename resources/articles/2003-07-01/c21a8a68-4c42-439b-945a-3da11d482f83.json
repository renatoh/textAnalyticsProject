His first language is British Sign Language. Tyler is profoundly deaf. Tyler's family moved all the way from Wales to St Albans, Hertfordshire, so he could attend Heathlands school for the deaf. The McTear family's decision to send their son to a special school is controversial. The current emphasis is on inclusion, so that all children are educated together, whatever their abilities and disabilities. But deaf children are often regarded as a unique case in the inclusion agenda. For many in the deaf community, deafness is not so much a disability as a culture. And Tyler's family wanted him to be taught in his own language, British Sign Language (BSL). \"Inclusion doesn't suit most profoundly deaf children,\" says John McTear, Tyler's father. Around a quarter of deaf children still go to special schools. Tyler, now in year 2, spent his first two years at a mainstream primary. \"The teachers were giving him books with pictures and telling him to point at them. It was like being illiterate,\" says McTear. If Tyler is taught in English, his father believes it's impossible to teach him age-appropriately. \"At his current school, the kids chat away in the playground in sign language. There are no communication problems. He needed a full language, with all its arts and poetry, and he has that now,\" he says. Tyler's parents went to college for three years to learn BSL, and are now fluent, as is his three-year-old sister Jana, who is not deaf. Jana started signing at nine months old, before she could talk. But learning a new language in order to communicate fully with your own child isn't a realistic option for most families; 95% of deaf children are born into families where BSL is not used. Ellen, aged nine, doesn't know BSL, and lip-reads fairly well. She is severely, rather than profoundly, deaf, which means she can hear certain frequencies with a digital hearing aid. Her partial hearing encouraged her mother to send Ellen to the local primary school in Twickenham, Middlesex, where her brother went. It had been initially suggested that she attend a school with a special deaf unit attached (around one third of deaf children in mainstream go to a school with such a unit), but that would have involved travelling one and a half hours to school and back. Her mother, Gill Rowlands, wanted her to stay close to home, her community and her family. Ellen, now in year 4, receives limited speech and language therapy, two sessions with a special needs teacher and one with a teacher for the hearing impaired each week. \"School is very tiring for her,\" says Gill Rowlands. \"It's a battle to get her to do her homework, as well as the extra work from her special needs teacher. She gets so tired from having to listen extra hard. She gets very irritable.\" Because of the low incidence of deafness - around 850 children a year are born with hearing loss - many teachers will never have met a child with a hearing impairment until one appears in their class. They will not, therefore, be aware of the complex ways in which learning and the development of language can be affected. \"Even with the best hearing aids, some frequencies will not be available. For example, you are unlikely to hear word endings because they're often high frequency, so you would struggle with the 's' plurals at the end of words. As a result, you might have difficulty acquiring grammar,\" says Elizabeth Andrews, head of education policy at the Royal National Institute for the Deaf. The RNID recommends simple steps to make comprehension and communication easier for a deaf child in a mainstream classroom: the teacher shouldn't stand with their back to the window, as it casts their face in shadow, making it difficult to read facial expressions; they should develop noise awareness, putting rubber tips on chair and table legs and making sure the classroom door is closed. Learning materials should be modified; at the simplest level, there should be written materials to support spoken lessons. And everything should be in plain English, with uncomplicated vocabulary. \"Modified texts and straightforward sentence structure, initially prepared with deaf pupils in mind, in fact benefits almost everyone, especially pupils with English as a second language,\" says Andrews. Indeed, some deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority, rather than part of the disabled community. Gill Rowlands is aware that, by opting for mainstream for her daughter, Ellen is divorced from this deaf culture. \"She says I wish I wasn't deaf. She says I'm not really deaf. I did wonder, at secondary, if it would be better for her to go to school for the deaf. Ellen finds it quite hard to be the only one.\" Richard Rieser of Disability Equality in Education is a passionate advocate of inclusion. Yet, when it comes to deaf children, he makes an exception, and doesn't necessarily think the best solution is to go to the nearest local school. \"Profoundly deaf children need to be educated with other deaf children,\" he says. \"There should be resourced deaf schools. If you have sign language interpreters in every room, and a number of deaf pupils, that's the best of both worlds. All the deaf pupils should be put in one form together. They can have their own culture, but also be included in the wider community. It's a lot better than deaf children going off to residential boarding schools.\" John McTear hopes Tyler will be ready to be re-integrated back into mainstream at the start of this coming academic year. He has recently had cochlear implants, which give him the sensation of hearing. The RNID has just published guidelines on their use, including in school. The radical extreme of the deaf community has condemned them, likening cochlear implants to genocide - an attempt to wipe out deaf people. But McTear believes a child can improve their hearing without losing their culture. \"Cochlear implants aren't a magical solution. They have to be removed when the child goes in water, at night and even sometimes when it rains. The child's always deaf.\" McTear hopes his son will bridge the hearing and deaf worlds. \"Tyler's two years in special school have been very important,\" he says. \"They have given him confidence and self-esteem, and his full language, through being immersed in it.\" Neil Crowther, policy manager at the Disability Rights Commission, says this special versus mainstream schooling controversy is a bit of a red herring. \"It's about what's going to give someone the capacity to be included in mainstream society. Going to special school may be in the better interest of a child's inclusion in the widest sense. And special schools should be seen as a more fluid option - you can move in and out of them, as a process of transition.\" At his new mainstream primary, Tyler will sign using an interpreter. His father hopes he will, with the cochlear implant, eventually become bilingual. \"Or even trilingual,\" says McTear. \"He might learn a foreign language! I want to see him standing up for himself in mainstream.\" \u00b7 National Deaf Children's Society: helpline 0808 800 8880; www.ndcs.org.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
