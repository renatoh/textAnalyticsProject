In the first few weeks, I made a lot of progress, such as making it through the class without feeling faint. In the subsequent months, I made minor gains in the areas of understanding basic instructions, remembering left from right and holding a plank. But there were moves where my insufficiency remained stark: the hard stuff, the shapes people post on Instagram. The crow, where you crouch down and tip forwards, balancing on your hands and getting your feet off the ground; the side crow, which is the same thing, sideways; the toe stand balance, where you cross one foot over the other knee, while standing, then somehow manoeuvre yourself to a hovering position, balanced on one set of toes. I thought it would come gradually over time, and it didn\u2019t (believe it or not, I\u2019ve had some help in the image above). I tried practising at home, but outside the yogic environs, I felt less confident than ever. Finally, I went to an expert: Nahid de Belgeonne, founder of the Good Vibes studio and a specialist in Feldenkrais, a \u201cneuromuscular\u201d method. It\u2019s about making your movements more connected and coherent, understanding your body as an interrelated whole. \u201cHow do you do that, though?\u201d I begin, introducing an unwanted 21st-century results-driven energy to the room. \u201cWell, you really have to concentrate,\u201d De Belgeonne says gently. Huh. We don\u2019t start with a crow; the first move is a downward dog, which everyone can do. Except I\u2019ve been doing it wrong. My hands aren\u2019t planted right, and neither are my feet. \u201cIf you\u2019re not stable, your body won\u2019t trust you, and it won\u2019t do what you want.\u201d Everything is easier, smoother and more natural once your digits are actually pushing into the ground. \u201cYou\u2019ve stopped breathing,\u201d De Belgeonne points out. \u201cIf you\u2019re not breathing, you\u2019re not doing yoga. You\u2019re just making shapes.\u201d We move on: she draws me a diagram of the crow. You\u2019re not, it turns out, balancing on your hands. The flexion of the spine draws in all the muscles beneath and around it; your core, your back \u2013 that\u2019s what holds you up, not your weeny arms. Not even trying to get my legs off the ground, I spend ages just tipping myself forward, trying to process which muscles are engaged and which aren\u2019t. Suddenly it strikes me that I don\u2019t really care about the show-off stuff; that if you\u2019re doing it right, everything is a challenge. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t really see the point in those poses,\u201d De Belgeonne says. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, you\u2019d be better off doing a circus skills class.\u201d Overpowered by her wisdom, I leave with a completely different set of priorities. Then, a week later, I can do a crow. What I learned The best way to protect yourself from a bad back is to use it often \u2013 experiment with its full range and position. \u2022 Find a teacher near you at feldenkrais.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
