Luigi Di Maio, the deputy prime minister and leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which is ruling in coalition with the far-right League, said the government was committed to maintaining its deficit target of 2.4% but it would move forward with plans to cut taxes, introduce a universal basic income and lower the retirement age. Italian leaders had until midnight on Tuesday to respond to the commission, which last month took the unprecedented step of asking a member state to revise its draft budget. The yield gap, or effective interest rate, on 10-year Italian government bonds is hovering about 300 basis points above German debt, seen as Europe\u2019s safe-haven investment, ahead of Tuesday\u2019s budget deadline. \u201cIn the letter to the EU, we have included safeguard clauses to avoid the target going over 2.4% in case the government\u2019s growth projections are not confirmed,\u201d Di Maio said. \u201cWe are convinced that this is the budget that will restart the country.\u201d He added that the government would seek to raise money by selling some state-owned property, but would stick to other plans. These include refunding those who lost savings in a deal brokered in 2016 by the previous administration to rescue four banks and providing funds to the 11 regions affected by recent flooding. The government believes the strategy will produce growth of 1.5% over the coming year, despite the economy stalling in the third quarter. Italy is saddled with about \u20ac2.3tn (\u00a32tn) of public debt and the Bank of Italy warned on Friday that the cost of servicing the extra debt could rise to \u20ac5bn in 2019 and \u20ac9bn in 2020. Matteo Salvini, also deputy prime minister and leader of the League, said the budget would \u201cguarantee more jobs, pension rights and less tax, not for everyone, but for many Italians\u201d. Analysts suspect the defiance of Europe is part of a strategy, particularly by Salvini, to whip up anti-EU anger among voters ahead of the European elections. However, it is also likely the government will make some budget changes behind the scenes. \u201cIt is more about communication than politics \u2013 they will try to defy, but they will make some small changes to the budget,\u201d said Mattia Diletti, a politics professor at Sapienza University in Rome. \u201cIt is a typical Italian way to say one thing and then do something else.\u201d About \u20ac10bn has been set aside in the budget to fund the universal basic income, a key campaign promise by the Five Star Movement. But some changes to the initiative have already been made since Di Maio jubilantly announced in September that it would \u201cpull 6 million people out of poverty\u201d. \u201cThere will be less money for less people,\u201d said Diletti. Roberto D\u2019Alimonte, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome, said the government\u2019s aim seemed to be to deliberately collide with the EU. The commission could impose sanctions if the budget does not change. \u201cBut in the end, the EU isn\u2019t really the referee,\u201d said D\u2019Alimonte. \u201cThe issue is the sustainability of the debt, and this will be decided by the markets, not the EU.\u201d There is also little in the budget that reflects an investment strategy for growth. \u201cThere is only a political strategy \u2013 they need to please their constituencies,\u201d said D\u2019Alimonte."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
