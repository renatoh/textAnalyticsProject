All that pressure to work hard and party harder. In the clamour to be at un-missable gigs and to meet unmovable deadlines, few of us pay attention to the small matters of eating and sleeping. It's no wonder that students graduate in a knackered state. But in these competitive times you can no longer afford to stay knackered for long. You have just a few weeks to transform yourself from a shattered student to a lean, mean job-hunting machine that can operate at peak performance, possibly for several months to come. Try this five-step plan to getting and staying fit for the job of finding a job: 1. Take in the basics If you don't give your body all the nutrients it needs it'll under perform. It's that simple. If you do nothing else, at least grab breakfast, eat regularly, snack on iron rich foods, such as dried apricots, and drink plenty of fluids. This alone, says Catherine Collins, spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, will deliver the goods. Namely, your brain will work properly - crucial during those interviews - and you'll have more physical stamina, essential for all that running across town from one appointment to the next. 2. Get hot and sweaty Eating well will prepare you for step two - doing regular cardiovascular exercise. Management guru Tony Robbins reckons there's a strong correlation between working out and working your way up the career ladder. In his public lectures he makes his audiences shake themselves around until they literally get hot under their designer collars. Sometimes they come away with exercise plans. Why? Because aerobic activity releases endorphins. These are the body's own happy drugs. They give you that go-for-it feeling - something you will need in abundance to keep your spirits up, especially if your job hunting drags on. So, take up jogging, pick up a racket or go out clubbing. Just do something energetic twice a week. 3. Stretch it out If you actually can't stand the thought of so much exertion then opt for the softer option - learn a few simple yoga moves. Forget the hype about getting the ideal six pack or reaching some sort of spiritual nirvana. Think instead that these easy actions will help to remove the physical and mental stresses that go with searching for that all important first break. Andrea Fox, editor of Yogauk.com, recommends this daily mini-routine: Stand up straight, breathe in slowly, raising your arms to the ceiling, then breath out again, this time lowering your arms. Repeat this movement, rising on tiptoes on the way up and lowering your heels on the way down. Still standing, swing your arms round your body, first to the left, then to right, relaxing your shoulders as you go. Now, sitting, close your eyes for one minute, consciously relaxing any tight muscles. And all this in just five minutes. 4. Get your head down When you are job hunting you really should get eight hours sleep a night. Research shows that your mind and your body take this long to recharge. But worrying about your employment prospects means you may not be sleeping too well. If you are shattered after a night of tossing and turning have a 15-minute kip. According to Dr Louise Reyner, of the Sleep Research Centre, this can be enough to get refocused on those recruitment websites. 5. Stimulate your brain If you think about finding a job 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, you will soon become bored and frustrated. You will loose your motivation. And you will get further away from achieving your objective. It is vital, therefore, that every so often your mind becomes occupied with other ideas and issues. Watch the news and stay informed about the world. Visit a modern art exhibition and be challenged by what you view. Go to an obscure foreign film, just for the sake of seeing something really new. Pick up an author you have never read before. Flick through a section of the newspaper you normally ignore. Whatever it is, make sure it broadens your intellectual horizons. This five-step plan ain't foolproof. But, at the very least, it will help to sustain you through your job-hunting campaign - whether it be a short or long one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
