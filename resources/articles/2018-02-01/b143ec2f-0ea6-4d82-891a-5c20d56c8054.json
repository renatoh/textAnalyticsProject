You\u2019ve probably got a silly name. On the other hand, you might be getting rocked to sleep by an \u00a3800 robotic crib. Such has been the fate of Dimitri Kutcher, the one-year-old second son of actors Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher. Interviewed on a recent episode of Dax Shepard\u2019s podcast, Kutcher Sr revealed the couple were \u201ceternally grateful\u201d to the Snoo Smart Sleeper, designed by paediatrician and bestselling parenting author Dr Harvey Karp, which rocks a baby to sleep at different speeds depending on the volume of their wailing. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d said Kutcher, who claimed Dimitri slept for a full six hours when he was just three days old. But it\u2019s not the only fancy baby gadget on the market \u2013 here are some of the most extravagant: Crib The Nursery Works Vetro Crib purports to be \u201cthe first 100% recyclable, non-toxic acrylic crib on the market\u201d. It retails for about \u00a33,250, is transparent, so as not to emotionally scar your baby by enclosing them within the wooden bars of, say, Ikea\u2019s perfectly serviceable \u00a359 SNIGLAR cot. Bath It\u2019s never too early for a jacuzzi, or so suggest the Italian creators of the \u00a31,358 Onda Luxy Bubbles Baby Spa Bath, which has an \u201cair massage\u201d system, digital water temperature display and coloured LED lighting designed to set your child\u2019s mood. What\u2019s wrong with the kitchen sink? Formula maker The \u00a3144 BabyNes infant nutrition system is a Nespresso machine for baby formula. It produces \u201ca perfectly measured bottle, at the temperature you select,\u201d in less than a minute, from pods of powder formula mixed for five stages of growth. Pram The Royal Family has been parading its offspring in the Silver Cross Balmoral Pram ever since it was created in 1877. Made in Yorkshire and sold by John Lewis for \u00a31,600, it is twice as dear as some prams from the notoriously costly Bugaboo range, and it doesn\u2019t even fold away. Shoes No list of extravagant consumerism would be complete without a contribution from Gwyneth Paltrow, who last year launched Christian Louboutin\u2019s first baby shoe range in collaboration with her website, Goop. The \u00a3180 \u201cLoubibabys\u201d come with the designer\u2019s signature red sole, in a traditional \u201cMary Jane\u201d style."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
