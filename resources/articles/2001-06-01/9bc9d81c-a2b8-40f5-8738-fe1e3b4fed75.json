So it follows that if you've got children and will be anywhere around the M25 during the long summer break, you'll be nagged to take them to one or more of the three big local theme parks: Chessington World of Adventures, Legoland Windsor and Thorpe Park. Great fun though such a family day out can be, it won't be cheap. Unless you are a pro at saying \"no\" to pleading children, think in terms of \u00a3100 upwards, including lunch, snacks and toy shop treats, for a family of four. So it's worth genning up on what's on offer at the different parks and what exactly you'll have to shell out before going. Here then is your answer. After taking a small group of children of varying ages at least once to each park, I'm offering an unashamedly subjective rundown on all three. Chessington World of Adventures Two miles from M25 junctions 9 or 10, it is impressively clean, tidy and fresh looking - a piece of litter wouldn't survive more than a couple of minutes under the eagle eyes of the cleaning staff. Primarily pitched at families with children of 12 and below, Chessington definitely has something for children of all ages with a big variety of rides from the really scary Samurai and Rameses Revenge through to gentle Toytown rides for younger children like Flying Jumbos and the new Toadie's Crazy Cars. We all loved the new Trail of the Kings \"jungle-themed animal experience,\" which lets you get close up via huge viewing windows to a large gorilla family and some of the world's most rare big cats. Other animal attractions including penguins, monkeys and birds of prey and owl displays in which the children can take part are reminders that Chessington originally started out as a zoo. We managed to get round most of the things we wanted to see in the day, though admittedly it was early in the season and queues were therefore short. Chessington, like Thorpe Park, which is also run by The Tussaud's Group, has a large number of food franchise outlets, including McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut, plus a variety of other restaurants, cafes and sweet shops all charging average high street prices.So there's lots of choice for fussy children and you won't pay over the odds. Ticket prices Pay on the day: \u00a319.95 adult; \u00a316 child aged 4-12;\u00a363 family ticket (two adults and two children or one adult and three children); under-4s free. Book ahead by phone on 0870-444-7777 and get up to \u00a32 off each ticket or a family ticket for \u00a359. Book in advance online at Chessington and get up to \u00a33 off each ticket or a family ticket for \u00a355. Holiday opening times: July 16 to September 2, 9.30am to 7.30pm. Thorpe Park On the A320 off the M25 junction 11 or 13, it is being pitched as the \"teenage thrills mecca\" with plenty of white-knuckle rides for older children including the new and terrifying Detonator, Vortex and Zodiac. But families shouldn't be put off: our seven-year-old and three-year-old both had a good time. There are rides for younger children and toddlers, a huge artificial beach area and a farm which is reached by waterbus or mini train. Also, provided they meet the height restrictions, there are plenty of children of, say, seven upwards intrepid enough to brave the massive water drop ride Tidal Wave (1.2m) and other white knuckle rides (from 1.4m). One thing many parents may find irritating about Thorpe Park and Chessington is that, unlike Legoland, both sites are dotted with fairground-style game stalls that attract children with the chance of winning large prizes for which you have to pay an extra \u00a31-\u00a32 per turn. These are hard to bypass and, unless you have a heart of stone, can soon cost you a fortune. On the day of our visit the new Zodiac ride, which spins riders a full 360 degrees at 60km per hour, was out of action. We were impressed that, as compensation, Thorpe Park was handing out vouchers as visitors left, giving them \u00a37 off their next entry ticket. Ticket prices Pay on the day: \u00a319 adult; \u00a315 child aged 12 or less; \u00a359 family ticket (two adults and two children or one adult and three children); children under 1m free. Book ahead by phone on 0870 444 4466 and get up to \u00a32 off each ticket or a family ticket for \u00a355. Book in advance at www.thorpe park.com and get up to \u00a33 off each ticket or a family ticket for \u00a351. Holiday opening times: July16 to September 2, 9.30am-7.30pm. Legoland Two miles from Windsor close to the M4, M3 and M25, it is mainly geared to infants and children up to about 10. Though it has three pretty scary rides - The Dragon, Pirate Falls and Wave Surfer - older children and teens won't find much else to grab them. For Lego enthusiasts, however, it is heaven on earth. Highlights include the Driving School and Boating School, the amazing Miniland featuring miniature cities from around the world with moving attractions all built out of Lego, live shows and the Duplo gardens for younger children with great play areas, rides and opportunities to get very wet. Also popular is the Pirate Goldwash where you pan for gold and win a medal, the only attraction to cost extra at \u00a31.50. Food outlets here are perhaps a bit pricier than at rival parks. Particularly good is the Harbourside Restaurant offering children's meals as well as fresh foods cooked on the spot. We picked a disastrous day, however. Two of the main rides were out of action virtually all day. Then the popular new Lego Racers attraction developed a technical hitch. This meant queuing for more than one and a quarter hours and at no time were we warned what to expect. Legoland offered visitors no compensation. Ticket prices Pay on the day: \u00a318.50 adult; \u00a315.50 child aged 3-15. Children under three free. Book ahead by phone on 0870 -504 0404 and save \u00a31 per person. You can book at www.legoland.com but there is no discount. Holiday opening times: School holidays, 10am-7pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
