Two new reports, including one by a former ecologist for the NSW environment and heritage office, say the company had not adequately responded to submissions which raise concerns about animal and plant surveys Santos conducted for its environmental impact statement. Santos\u2019s formal reply to more than 20,000 public submissions was criticised by opponents when it was released earlier this year. David Paull, a consultant ecologist who was employed by the NSW government, wrote a response disputing Santos\u2019s findings that endangered box gum woodlands were not present at the project site and that yellow box was either absent or \u201coccurs at such low abundance to be meaningless in terms of plant composition\u201d. Paull said the company had also failed to conduct surveys for stygofauna, which are species that help purify groundwater, despite a recommendation from the independent expert scientific committee that it do so. In a separate report, an ecologist, David Milledge, said concerns he raised about animal surveys at the project site in a submission with the North West Alliance \u201chave not been satisfactorily addressed\u201d. Species surveyed for include the Pilliga mouse, koalas, the south-eastern long-eared bat and the eastern pygmy possum. A 10-day survey by Landmark Ecological Services \u2013 led by Milledge in 2011 \u2013 found more than twice the animals in the project area than Santos had recorded from 2010 to 2014. \u201cSantos\u2019s lack of success in detecting the presence of threatened vertebrate species over four years of surveys in the project area provides little confidence that the proposed scouting framework will be effective in avoiding impacts on significant values,\u201d Milledge wrote. But a spokeswoman for Santos said the scientific rigour of its surveys was \u201csecond to none\u201d and had been designed by experts on each species. The data was then peer-reviewed. \u201cThe EIS has concluded the Narrabri gas project is unlikely to have any significant impact on threatened species and it is now a matter for the NSW independent planning commission and the federal environment minister to make their determination,\u201d she said. Naomi Hodgson, the Newcastle campaigner for the Wilderness Society, said Santos\u2019s claim there would be no impact was questionable when it still had not made public which parts of the Pilliga forest would be cleared for the project and \u201cits studies seem to massively underestimate wildlife numbers\u201d. \u201cThe federal environment department said the Narrabri gas project would have a \u2018likely significant impact\u2019 on 10 endangered species and two ecological communities when it decided the project would need federal approval to proceed,\u201d she said. \u201cThey include the koala, the Pilliga mouse, the spotted-tail quoll, the south-eastern long-eared bat and the regent honeyeater, as well as the Brigalow forests, home to the black-striped wallaby.\u201d A spokesman for the NSW planning and environment department said it had \u201casked Santos to provide additional information and clarification on a number of matters relating to the environmental impacts of the project\u201d. He said the information from the North West Alliance submission, as well as advice on biodiversity matters from the NSW environment and heritage office, was being considered. The department will refer its final assessment to the independent planning commission, which will make the final decision on the project."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
