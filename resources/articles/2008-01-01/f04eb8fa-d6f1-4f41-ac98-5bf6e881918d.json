Born in Rochdale, he moved to Hong Kong where he became something of a hero, releasing a whole batch of albums and touring Asia. Now comes his UK debut, which is highly competent and varied, but sadly unoriginal. There's a bit of everything here, from blues-edged country pop dressed up with classy slide guitar, through to introspective acoustic ballads and a sudden furious burst of electric blues-rock guitar that sounds like a Led Zep tribute band, but with added impressive harmonica work. So it goes on, from the pleasantly lilting Something Special to more pounding blues rockers such as Love Bites or Time of Day, which again boasts some very fine harmonica work. I'm sure that he would have sounded like a revelation if suddenly come across in a Chinese club, but his Asian experiences have sadly had no effect on his style. He is a talented musician, as shown by the instrumental Sundown, the best track here, but he desperately needs a style of his own."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
