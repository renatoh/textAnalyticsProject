My animal rights activism has never gone beyond the free-range eggs stage. But it is the human possibilities raised by Hiasl's case, championed by the Association Against Animal Factories (VGT), that caught my attention. If a chimpanzee can be declared a person, then there's nothing in the way of a person becoming an ape - and I'm not just talking about a retroactive status applied to ex-husbands. In fact, I predict a surge in trans-specied people, who will eagerly go over to the side of the chimps. The transition need not involve costly surgical arm extensions and whole-body Rogaine treatments, since we are practically chimpanzees already. We share 99% of our genomes with them, making it possible for chimps to accept human blood transfusions and kidney donations. Despite their vocal limitations, they communicate easily with each other and can learn human languages. They use tools and live in groups which display behaviour that anthropologists recognise as culture. And we may be a lot closer biologically than Darwin ever imagined. Last May, paleontologists reported evidence of inter-breeding between early humans and chimps as recently as 5 million years ago, and proposed that modern humans are the result of this ancient predilection for bestiality. Hiasl's motivation is economic: the animal sanctuary where he resides has run out of funds, and in Austria, only a person can receive personal donations. Many humans in this country may be similarly motivated to seek chimp status. There are individuals who commit crimes in order to gain access to the free food and medical care available in a prison. How much easier to have oneself declared a chimp and win entry to the soft life of a zoo animal! Not only are the guards friendly, but one's enclosure has been designed with far more psychological forethought than the average office. True, not all chimps have it as easy as Hiasl, who spends most of his time watching TV. There's the danger of being sold to a pharmaceutical company for research, for example, but this should decline as chimps achieve human status. We can't expect much progress on chimpanzee rights in Bush's America, according to Elizabeth Hess, author of the forthcoming book Nim Chimpsky: The Chimp Who Would Be Human. But in addition to the Austrian debate, the Spanish parliament is considering a bill to extend \"fundamental moral and legal protections\" to apes. Once apes achieve these protections, American humans are going to want them too. I'm thinking food, shelter and veterinary care. Another reason to make the human-to-ape transition is the sex, at least if you're smart enough to declare yourself a bonobo. Bonobos, genetically as close to humans as larger chimpanzees, use sex much as we use handshakes - as a form of greeting between individuals in any gender combination. See an old friend, and you start rubbing genitals together, with orgasm serving as a hearty \"How ya doin', pal?\" Plus, bonobo bands are female-dominated, a special enticement to women investigating their chimpanzee transition options. There is another, less selfish reason, to seek chimpanzee status. Like me, you may be a wee bit disappointed in our own species. Here we are - the tool-wielding, word-spouting brainiacs of the earth - and what have we done with our powers? We've poisoned the world, encrusted it with our unsightly infrastructure, and exterminated most of our fellow earth-dwellers, from elephants and tigers to fish. Of course, what makes humans especially obnoxious is our tendency to believe in our absolute superiority over all creatures. We alone, of all species, have come up with religions and philosophies that declare us uniquely deserving of global hegemony. Yet, one by one, our \"unique\" human traits have turned out to be shared: chimpanzees have culture; dolphins make art (in the form of bubble patterns); female vampire bats share food with friends; male baboons will die to defend their troop; rats have recently demonstrated a capability for reflection that resembles consciousness. We are animals, and they are us. But just because you want to attain the status of a chimp, don't assume that you'll make the cut. Just as we don't know how the Austrian court will rule in Hiasl's case, we have no reason to believe that the chimps will have us. \u00b7 Barbara Ehrenreich is the author of Dancing in the Streets \u00a9 The Nation"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
