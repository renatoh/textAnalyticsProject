As the debt-laden club secured a seven-week breathing space from its creditors, it revealed that Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Mubarak al-Khalifa had approached with a possible offer. The club, which has enough money to continue operating until January 19, made it clear it was by no means certain that the sheikh would formally table a bid that would see it being taken over. But they admitted it would need to find people that were either prepared to a make a Leeds given seven-week deadline \"substantial investment\" in the business or even take it over. If Leeds fail to do so by the January deadline, the club expects to have to call in the administrators, who would protect it from its \u00a380m debts. This might make it a more attractive takeover target, although Leeds last night warned their shareholders that any offer would be unlikely to reap them much profit. A potential bid could be made by deputy chairman Allan Leighton, who yesterday confirmed his resignation from the board. Leighton, who is also chairman of Royal Mail and internet business lastminute.com, had left the board, the club said, to \"avoid any conflict of interest should he decide to become involved in any future funding or purchase of the business\". Until last month he had been working on injecting \u00a34.4m into the club - along with the sheikh - but the plan had to be abandoned when doubts emerged about the Bahraini's commitment to put up his money. The club was instead left to negotiate a lifeline from its creditors, who have agreed to forego repayments on debt until January 19 and provide it with enough operating capital. The negotiations have been conducted by former Chelsea chief executive Trevor Birch, who now holds the same position at Leeds. He has secured a deal that allows them to dip into \u00a34.1m set aside as security for \u00a360m of the loans. In addition, they will not have to pay the \u00a31.7m owed for a complex arrangement under which it pays for players until January 19. HSBC have also agreed to grant a new loan facility."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
