The guided-missile destroyer, made famous when al-Qaida rammed a rubber dingy into its hull, killing 17 sailors, is deployed in international waters to show support for \"regional stability\". Lebanon is the political chessboard of the Middle East, where the multifaceted range of alliances and interests face each other off through intermediaries and proxies. The Americans have returned to this arena after a hiatus of 10 years during which Washington acquiesced in Syrian hegemony in return for Damascus's support against Saddam Hussein. America's return, 9/11, the war on terror and the invasion of Iraq combined to create a political standoff in Lebanon, with two sides polarised into a pro-west and anti-Syrian government versus an anti-west and pro-Syrian opposition. Beginning in 2000, the return of American interests and the wane of Syrian power in Lebanon culminated in the humiliating withdrawal of Syrian troops in 2005, which the US embassy hailed as the Cedar Revolution - a catchphrase then claimed by Lebanese politicians. Yet betting on Lebanon is a risky business and the inherent fragility of the state was again demonstrated by the autonomous actions of Hizbullah which led to the battering of Lebanon's population and infrastructure by Israeli forces in 2006. The 2006 war and the disintegration of the US project in Iraq have allowed Syria and Iran, especially, to emerge as powerful regional players. Present US-Syrian relations are fairly schizophrenic; the storm clouds that surrounded Damascus have lightened somewhat as Syria has played a constructive role in securing its border with Iraq. Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice met her Syrian counterpart, Walid Moallem, at the regional security conference in 2007 and Syria was also invited to take part in the Annapolis Israeli-Palestinian peace conference last year. US-Iranian relations are perhaps more paradoxical. Despite the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) lowering concerns over Iran's nuclear programme, tensions remain high, as highlighted by the recent standoff between the US navy and Iranian ships in the Gulf. Israel is particularly concerned by the emergence of a rival - potentially armed with nuclear weapons - that could challenge its regional military supremacy; its strike on suspected Syrian WMD facilities last September was seen by many as a dry run for attacking Iran itself. In the midst of such tensions, President Ahmadinejad visited Iraq last week, travelling the \"road of death\" from the airport to Baghdad and spending time in the US-fortified Green Zone, in stark contrast to the \"surprise\" visits of President Bush. So while relations vis-a-vis Iraq can be described as uneasy, where Lebanon is concerned they are truly strained. Washington is steadily increasing the largely symbolic, targeted sanctions against Damascus while levelling frequent warnings about its meddling in the Lebanese political process. This alleged meddling led to the deployment of the USS Cole. Lebanon therefore has on its horizon the unresolved presidential election, the small matter of the international tribunal over who killed former prime minister Rafik Hariri and of course the the USS Cole herself. But what exactly can a destroyer armed with an Aegis combat system hope to achieve in Lebanon? Surely the days are gone when the sight of a western warship on the horizon would cause the natives to down weapons and flee. During the Lebanese civil war (1976-1990), the USS New Jersey would frequently hit militia positions with shells the size of cars, yet the US still had to withdraw from the conflict following suspected Hizbullah attacks on its Marine barracks and embassy. The danger of escalation and a Hizbullah response to the arrival of the USS Cole should not be underestimated, as the Israel navy learned in 2006 when a Silkworm missile successfully crippled one of its missile boats. In addition, many have predicted a spectacular Hizbullah reaction to the assassination of top-ranking official Imad Mughniyah last month. Yet Iran, Syria and Hizbullah have all played the long game in the past, and with the Bush presidency creeping through its lame-duck final months in office, all parties may choose to ignore gunboat diplomacy, keeping Lebanon in its dangerous hiatus until the arrival of the next US administration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
