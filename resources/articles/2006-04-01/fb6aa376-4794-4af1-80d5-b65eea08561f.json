Members of the National Union of Teachers said society was now characterised by \"the relentless targeting of children and young people\", creating unprecedented challenges for parents. Delegates warned that parents and children needed help to resist pressures from advertising which, for example, encouraged youngsters to spend \u00a390 on a pair of Nike trainers. After heated debate at the NUT's annual conference in Torquay, delegates backed an amendment calling on the government to invest in parenting classes and parental support networks. It said \"commercial targeting\" meant it was not \"cool\" for pupils to work hard at school, adding: \"Instead of blaming parents for poor pupil behaviour the government should invest in parenting classes and parental support networks that are available to all parents, up to and including when their children become teenagers.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
