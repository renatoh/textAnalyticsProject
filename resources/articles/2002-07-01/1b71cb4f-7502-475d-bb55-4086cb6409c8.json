Dorothy Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal, begun at Dove Cottage in May 1800 and kept for almost three years, was not meant for posterity. It was not even, like her brother William's great autobiographical poem \"The Prelude\", circulated among friends and family. It was written just for herself and for her brother, to \"give Wm pleasure by it\". It preserved, only for the two of them, the particularities of their lives, the sharp outlines of their ordinary days. For Dorothy, who had been sent to live with various friends and relatives after her mother's death when she was six, the journal recorded the first settled domestic life that she had known. In her mid-20s she had finally been reunited with her brother. (A fragment of her Alfoxden Journal, as transcribed by a later editor, survives and is included in this edition.) So it is with sustaining delight that, in the Grasmere Journal, she describes what was often a life of austerity or discomfort. Everyday employments are worth detailing, even down to the sometimes gruesome-sounding meals (\"giblet pie\") she prepares. She describes what she and her brother read, whom they meet, where they walk. She has a relish for every variety of weather and light, fastidiously preserving colours and impressions. The writing is compelling for its care, rather than because of any special literary qualities, though there are odd moments of vision: \"The moonshine like herrings in the water\", meadows \"heaving like sand\". Much seems offered to William for the material of his poetry (and she never doubts that her business is to sustain him for his writing). Here is the walk along the bank of Ullswater that Wordsworth later made into one of the most abiding of lyric poems. \"I never saw daffodils so beautiful they - tossed &amp; reeled &amp; danced &amp; seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the Lake.\" For lovers of William's poetry, there are many small shocks of recognition in the Journal. Here we encounter the originals of some of his poetic characters. We meet the actual Leech Gatherer of \"Resolution and Independence\" - in the poem a timeless traveller, in Dorothy's record a man with facts to tell her. He has had 10 children, all but one of whom are dead. The vagrants who wander through Lyrical Ballads are particular individuals in these journals. Encountering beggars, hearing their stories, giving them food or money - these were habitual activities. Travellers brought stories and Dorothy wrote them down. Her appetite for \"news\" is constant, as is her hunger for letters. In imagination she is always reaching out to those who might write to her and often worrying about Coleridge, whose letters invariably depress everyone with their news of further ailments. Illness and exhaustion recur. The famously \"healthy\" poet is forever being reported as unwell by his sister, \"worn to death\" in her eyes by his efforts at composition, but also afflicted by piles or - that horror of bucolic life - toothache. Her journal is not exactly a work of psychological complexity; feelings are only suggested, never specified. Many have theorised about Dorothy's relationship with her brother (\"my Beloved\"), but this is not made accessible to us. She does give us an extraordinary account of the day of his wedding to their childhood friend, Mary Hutchinson. With her characteristic blend of candour and reticence, Dorothy recalls her emotion when two men run up to the house \"to tell us it was over\". \"I could stand it no longer &amp; threw myself on the bed where I lay in stillness neither hearing or seeing any thing.\" Her journal came to an end some three months after the marriage, as if the intimacy that sustained it were now lost. Probably you already have to know something about the Wordsworths and their lives truly to relish this work. Pamela Woof has supplied ample annotations, but like many a private document the journal takes so much for granted that notes cannot explain everything. As Woof says in her introduction, Dorothy Wordsworth makes us believe \"that things were as she says they were\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
