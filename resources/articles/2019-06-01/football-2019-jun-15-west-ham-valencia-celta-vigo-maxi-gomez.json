Manuel Pellegrini is determined to continue improving his squad after signing Pablo Fornals from Villarreal on Friday and has long been an admirer of G\u00f3mez. However, West Ham fear they will miss out on the Uruguayan to Valencia, who can offer the 22-year-old Champions League football. It is understood that West Ham\u2019s offer for G\u00f3mez has not been accepted. His contract contains a \u00a345m release clause and Celta Vigo are using the interest in him to seek a higher fee. Another complication is that G\u00f3mez wants assurances that he will not be back-up to Marko Arnautovic, West Ham\u2019s first-choice striker. He will not move to the London Stadium if he is not part of Pellegrini\u2019s favoured starting line-up. Pellegrini initially wanted to sign G\u00f3mez when Arnautovic was trying to move to Guangzhou Evergrande in the Chinese Super League in January and he has continued to hold an interest in the Uruguayan. West Ham, who have told Manchester United that Issa Diop is not for sale this summer, have ambitious plans under Pellegrini and do not want their summer spending to stop at Fornals, a 23-year-old attacking midfielder who has been capped twice by Spain. Pellegrini, who oversaw a 10th-place finish in his first season at the London Stadium, wants to play attacking football next season. However, he is also aware that West Ham need to improve defensively and is targeting Eibar\u2019s Joan Jord\u00e1n. The defensive midfielder could be available for \u00a313m. In an effort to raise funds to finance the ambitious spree, Pellegrini will listen to offers for Sam Byram, Angelo Ogbonna, Jordan Hugill, Pedro Obiang, Reece Oxford and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez. However West Ham have no intention of losing Diop, who has been linked with a \u00a345m move to United . They have made clear that the promising French defender is not for sale."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
