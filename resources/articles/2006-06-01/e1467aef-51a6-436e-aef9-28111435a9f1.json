Ms Jowell, one of three ministers who will cheer on England in Cologne, says football's world governing body, Fifa, must improve the situation at future tournaments. The Football Association was allocated just 8% of tickets for each of England's matches, while 16% went to sponsors, 11% for hospitality and 6% to non-qualifying countries. About 36% of the 3m tickets were sold in a global internet ballot. Yesterday touts were asking between \u00a3410 and \u00a31,024 for a ticket for tonight's game, while official prices range from \u00a324 to \u00a368. England's allocation for the 44,000-capacity stadium is just 4,500. Ms Jowell told the Guardian: \"I have a great deal of sympathy with England fans who are being forced to pay such high prices to see the game. Ticket touting is nothing new and there will never be enough World Cup tickets to meet the incredible demand. But I deeply regret that more has not been done for fans.\" The minister, who will watch the game with the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and the foreign office minister Lord Triesman, last year held a summit designed to crack down on touts. She added: \"I am pleased Fifa have agreed to look at the situation for the next World Cup, so genuine fans are not forced into paying so much.\" Kevin Miles, international coordinator of the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF), yesterday said scores of black market tickets were available for tonight's game. Some tickets sold by touts to England supporters for the first two games came from the Costa Rican and Paraguayan FAs and the sponsor Gillette, while McDonald's tickets were being sold by touts at the South Korea v Togo game. Mr Miles said: \"This is not an accident; it is inherent in the system. If we want to address this problem, you have to go back to the starting point - every single black market ticket is a ticket that Fifa supplied to someone [who was] more interested in making money than watching the match.\" He said competing football associations should receive at least 15% of match tickets on condition that they go to genuine supporters. The FSF's global campaign is winning support and Dutch and Spanish versions of the FSF's \"Ticket for fans, not sponsors\" stickers have been printed. The FA said its system of selling to supporters' club members was the best method of reducing touting. \"If you sell on a loyalty basis, you are far less likely to get a black market,\" said a spokesman, Andrin Cooper. One of Germany's biggest selling newspapers, Bild am Sontag, has meanwhile voted England supporters the best in the world, a verdict welcomed by the British ambassador to Berlin. Sir Peter Torry, who last week condemned a tiny minority of fans as \"fat, uncouth and bad-mannered\" for singing anti-German songs, said: \"England fans are contributing hugely to the success of the tournament and doing the reputation of British football proud.\" Guido Kahlen, Cologne's deputy mayor, said the city would consider using the 18,000-capacity indoor Cologne Arena as a public viewing area if thunderstorms which drenched fans yesterday persisted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
