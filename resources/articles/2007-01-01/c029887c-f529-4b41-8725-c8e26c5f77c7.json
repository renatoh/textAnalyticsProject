The research, commissioned by the department, found that people did not want to have to select a hospital while they were seriously ill, preferring such decisions to be made by a trusted GP. It said there was no evidence that greater choice would improve quality of care, and good reason to fear it would benefit only the wealthy and articulate. The British Medical Association took copies of a summary of the research that appeared on the department's website last month under the department's official logo. It made them available to the Guardian after the online version disappeared. The study was commissioned in 2004 by the health department's research arm, the NHS service delivery and organisation R&amp;D programme. Its summary found that patients wanted better information about treatment options but thought they were given too little information to be able to exercise choice effectively. But a department spokesman said: \"The views they came up with were not those of the [department] and the logo was used without our permission. We raised the issue of the logo and asked for it to be removed. We were not aware that they would take the whole thing off.\" Patricia Hewitt, the health secretary, has insisted over the past year that patients want more choice. By 2008, patients needing non-emergency treatment will be entitled to choose any NHS hospital in England and any private hospital that meets NHS standards. But according to the commissioned study, by researchers at Manchester and Cardiff universities: \"Most severely ill patients face complex treatment options and prefer decisions to be made on their behalf by a well-informed and trusted health professional. Evidence that patients want the opportunity to select a distant hospital for non-urgent surgery is limited to situations where [they] face a long wait for a local hospital appointment and where there is a history of poor service.\" Their summary said: \"Wealthy and educated populations will be the main beneficiaries of a policy of extending patient choice, unless measures are introduced to help disadvantaged groups.\" Hamish Meldrum, the BMA's GP chairman, said: \"The paper supports a lot of what doctors knew instinctively about patients and choice. At times when patients' needs are not particularly urgent they may appreciate choice ... in an emergency, patients tend to want to go where their doctor recommends.\" The department spokesman said a full version of the research was published a year ago. \"The summary paper reflected the personal view of the researcher and did not present a balanced summary of the actual research, which does not find that offering choice is misguided.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
