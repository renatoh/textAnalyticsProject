A psychological drama? A Babadookian \u201chorror as metaphor\u201d using ghoulish symbolism to explore mother and daughter relationships? The answer is all of these things and none of them, though \u2013 given the story revolves around a physically and mentally deteriorating elderly woman, Edna (Robyn Nevin)\u2060 \u2013 it is about nothing if not matters of the mind. And yet it is also very ... sticky. Not just sticky as in something that clings to you emotionally, but sticky in the way horror movies offer gross literal things you could reach out and touch were you to have the misfortune of belonging to the film\u2019s narrative universe. James feasts on dread from the film\u2019s earliest moments, an early shot framing Edna in a way common in spooky genre pics: from behind, bathed in darkness, naked but for a towel, her exposed bare skin connoting vulnerability. Then the title appears on screen accompanied by a sound that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in an Alien movie or in a video game like The Last of Us: a sort of phlegm-covered supernatural throat crackle, as if a demon were opening their mouths and preparing to speak. The sound of demonic breath notwithstanding, it soon becomes apparent that Relic is a class act \u2013 the sort of film pundits sometimes snobbishly refer to as \u201celevated horror\u201d, promulgating the silly idea that genre productions are of generally lesser worth. This debate is a tangly one, and includes a kind of reverse snobbery: the argument that B-movies are somehow more \u201cpure\u201d or \u201caware\u201d for indulging in easy jump scares. There are jump scares in Relic, but nothing in this film was slapped together by genre algorithm. The story setup (it was co-written by James and novelist Christian White) involves Edna going missing from her small, old house in regional Victoria. Her daughter Kay (Emily Mortimer) and granddaughter Sam (Bella Heathcote) arrive to investigate, finding the place empty, with notes strewn all around, from the innocuous and instructional (\u201ctake pills\u201d) to the creepy and mysterious (\u201cdon\u2019t follow it\u201d). The passing of time is a key theme of the film, which James depicts visually from the beginning \u2013 before she burrows into what it means for the characters. We see evidence of time passing in an immediate sense (a bath overflowing with water) as well as the slightly longer term (fruit in a bowl has grown mouldy) to the significantly longer term (the tennis court overrun with grass). Also, importantly, we see it in the context of an entire life nearing its end, evidenced through the irreversible decline of Edna\u2019s body and mind. She is suffering from the onset of dementia and returns home safe and sound, more or less, albeit with some blood on her nightgown and what appears to be a large bruise. Or is that a rash? When asked where she\u2019s been, the huffy and standoffish Edna responds unhelpfully: \u201cI suppose I went out.\u201d Her unexplained absence prompts conversations about placing the increasingly confused and distraught matriarch in a home, as Kay and Sam ponder how to care for her. However the film\u2019s central location \u2013 the creaky, moss and stain covered house, where there are Poe-like sounds of something moving in the walls and a surrounding forest ensconced in thick surreal mist, like visions from a Vicki Madden production \u2013 is very much where the director keeps her focus. The nightmarish atmosphere James builds, with no small amount of assistance from cinematographer Charlie Sarroff, reminded me of the way dreams, ghosts and memories intersect in the 1998 film adaptation of Tim Winton\u2019s In the Winter Dark. Playing an elderly man who lives in a remote valley and never got over the death of his baby son decades ago, Ray Barrett reflected via voiceover: \u201cI started to have these dreams. Not mine, other people\u2019s. Dead people, broken people, breathe things into me.\u201d Anyone who has seen a loved one cognitively deteriorate through conditions such as dementia knows the horror runs both ways: terrifying for the person experiencing it, and shockingly sad for those witnessing it. Edna is both the film\u2019s source of emotion and empathy, as well as its lusus naturae, or even its monster \u2013 a person, or thing, growing deformed, feeding into the idea that time\u2019s unstoppable march forward claims us all in the long run. Fundamental to Relic\u2019s psychological oomph are three excellent performances, perfectly complementing that sticky-icky ambience. Nevin has the meatiest and most intense part: full of fluster and pain, obstinance and wariness. Mortimer has a way of looking at her that channels a mother\u2019s pain into a daughter\u2019s grief; the horror of having to say goodbye to somebody who is still physically present. Bella Heathcote is also very fine, rounding off the trio. If Relic sounds like an intellectual exercise; well it sort of is and sort of isn\u2019t. The beauty of this film \u2013 like The Babadook and Hereditary, which are also scary movies that explore parents and children \u2013 is that you feel it first, and think about it later. \u2022 Relic is available to stream now on Stan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
