Rooney will come out of international retirement to gain his 120th cap when he makes a brief substitute\u2019s appearance at Wembley on 15 November. The Football Association has designated the game The Wayne Rooney Foundation International, with the 33-year-old\u2019s foundation one of a number of charities which will benefit from the proceeds. England\u2019s record goalscorer will be an additional selection on top of the squad Southgate would normally have selected and will announce on Thursday. The DC United striker will join up with the rest of the party at St George\u2019s Park next week with England ostensibly using the USA match as preparation for their last, and potentially critical, Nations League tie against Croatia on 18 November. Rooney will have a cameo role in the friendly and it remains to be seen whether Southgate allows him to wear his usual No 10 shirt off the bench. The FA\u2019s promotional imagery for the game \u2013 albeit for advertising purposes \u2013 have shown Rooney in the shirt he effectively inherited from Michael Owen and went on to wear for much of his 13-year England career, including the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, and European Championships in 2012 and 2016. Raheem Sterling, who scored twice in the impressive 3-2 win in Spain last month, is the current No 10 having worn the shirt at the World Cup in Russia. It remains to be seen whether Sterling will be selected against USA given the match\u2019s proximity to the Croatia fixture. Yet the Manchester City forward, in scintillating form, would expect to be notified if Rooney were to reclaim the shirt, even as a one-off. Southgate is apparently aware that allowing Rooney to come off the bench wearing No 10 would prompt some raised eyebrows. England use allocated squad numbers only at major tournaments and, unlike other nations, line up 1-11 with replacements taking higher numbers. Rooney\u2019s 118th cap, a goalless draw with Slovenia in Ljubljana, saw him come on for the last 17 minutes wearing No 18."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
