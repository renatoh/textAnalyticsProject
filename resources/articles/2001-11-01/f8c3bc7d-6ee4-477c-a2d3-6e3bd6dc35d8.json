Louis Saha would play for France, they said, Lee Clark and Sean Davis for England. But things have not gone to plan and, as Jean Tigana's expensive side slid downwards after an encouraging start, the only call-ups Fulham's players have had probably involved the Samaritans. Now, at last, they are showing their potential. This was a second successive win, and a first away from home in the Premiership, against a West Ham side that had won their last three and were unbeaten at Upton Park. On Saturday, though, Glenn Roeder's team were at their worst. The only Hammer to emerge with any pride was the Australian centre-back Hayden Foxe. \"Oh mate,\" he said, \"I'd rather play like poo if we could win.\" Several of his team-mates did, though Roeder apparently singled out one . \"The manager was very angry at me,\" said S\u00e9bastien Schemmel, West Ham's right-back. \"He said I didn't respect his tactics and it was my fault. He said I played very badly and the team played very badly, because I have a big influence on the team, so the team had to play with 10 players today. It's true that it was my fault.\" That is not quite so. The home side created two early chances, hitting the post from the second in the 12th minute; their next goalscoring opportunity was in injury-time. In between they could do nothing right. Paolo di Canio tried hard but the Italian could not hold a Roman candle to the less showy skills of Steed Malbranque. Fulham's French midfielder won this game, swinging in the corner from which Sylvain Legwinski scored Fulham's first and growing in stature from then on. His earlier shot was one of two cleared off the line by West Ham's Foxe in the box. Later he did score, as a desperate Di Canio dived over his static leg on the edge of Fulham's area, losing the ball but not winning a free-kick, and Saha raced upfield. Malbranque was the only man capable of keeping pace with him and duly converted Saha's pass from 10 yards. It was not a good day for Di Canio. He spent most of it trying to win free-kicks but generally failed to win Graham Barber's sympathy. \"Paolo said that he's never had a good relationship with that referee,\" said Trevor Sinclair. \"You could say that about most of them I suppose but that was definitely a free-kick.\" The weekend got worse for the Italian when several Sunday newspapers printed pictures of him with his hands round Barry Hayles' throat. He was, in fact, intervening after a first-half altercation between Hayles and Foxe, who were both booked, and was so infuriated by the photographs that he yesterday telephoned Sky Sports to clear his name. \"I never had the intention to strangle him,\" he said. \"If you see the pictures I have a very relaxed face and that is unusual for me in a game, so this proves that I had no bad intentions. \"I can't accept this any more. I intend to take legal action because they [the press] are absolutely bad people.\" Man of the match : Steed Malbranque (Fulham)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
