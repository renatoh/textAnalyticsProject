One of the two Manchester clubs may beat them at Wembley but they will not cause the consternation that Blackburn strewed by notching the first two goals of the night to go ahead on aggregate after their 1-0 loss at home. The red card for Christopher Samba after 30 minutes was the moment that put the tie beyond recovery. It let Villa pull the score in this match to 2-2 after James Milner had converted the penalty. With a 10-man Blackburn irrepressible, even the home support must still have had doubts, if only because it was tough to keep track of the score, let alone add the result of the first match to the equation. Considering all the giddy brains, the euphoria at the close was natural. Maybe Villa can try that explanation when the authorities ask them to account for the celebratory pitch invasion. So intrepid were the losers that they were probably not be convinced fully of the hopelessness of their situation until Ashley Young curled in a sixth for Villa in stoppage time. Disadvantaged as the opposition was, that strike and the team's half-dozen goals did hint that Martin O'Neill's team have the potential to grow more expressive in the Premier League. It will be the losers who will be remembered. There can only be the utmost regard for an indefatigable side. They were playing with gusto even when 5-2 down. Brett Emerton scored their fourth with a low shot in the 84th minute. O'Neill's side failed to impose their will steadily enough but that away win in the first leg created a dilemma that robbed them of impetus. While they pondered how to deal with this return match, the visitors scored twice. Nikola Kalinic, who hit the woodwork twice in the first leg, was more accurate with a pair of first-half finishes. Villa may have been level by half-time, but it was natural that the recovery should not depend solely on the attackers. O'Neill has improved his defence and midfield radically but it is not so simple to afford a top-class forward or persuade such a figure to come to Birmingham when he pictures himself in Milan, Barcelona, Madrid or, for that matter, London. The Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor did make an important if deplorable contribution to his side's first goal after half an hour. It seemed that he knocked Ryan Nelsen off-balance at the near post as Young's cross flew deep for the left-back, Stephen Warnock, to shoot home. Villa's expert midfield also made their mark. Milner levelled this game with a penalty when he started and finished a move. His opportunity to score here came when Agbonlahor burst on to a pass from Young outpaced the defence before being brought down by Samba. The centre-half was sent off by Martin Atkinson before Milner tied the match from the spot. That episode ought to have helped his side recover poise fully after being shaken initially. Villa would be expected to withstand a corner, but when David Dunn delivered one in the 10th minute a leaping Kalinic connected cleanly and a slight deflection off Warnock helped the ball into the net. Blackburn struck again in the 26h minute. Martin Olsson connected strongly with a Morten Gamst Pedersen cross and although Brad Guzan saved excellently Kalinic turned in the loose ball. Even so, Blackburn's security, if not their optimism, was crumbling. Villa rapidly scored three times. An own goal was especially dispiriting for the visitors in the 52nd minute. A Stewart Downing corner came off the Blackburn full-back Ga\u00ebl Givet and the Vllla centre-half Richard Dunne before a touch from Steven Nzonzi sent the ball into his own net. Milner pounced next when he burst forward after the referee played the advantage after a foul on Heskey. The midfielder's shot brushed Agbonlahor's hand on its way but Atkinson allowed the goal to stand. The scorer was soon setting up Heskey to go around Robinson to finish. Spirit was not lacking in the Blackburn ranks and Olsson claimed a goal stylishly with an overhead kick. The night belonged to Villa and this was an occasion that may also inspire a surge in Premier League form. This may not have been their finest showing from a coach's perspective and no control of the evening was exercised, but there was a show of talent from individual such as Milner. Blackburn had demanded it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
