RTHK\u2019s Yvonne Tong asked WHO advisor Bruce Aylward whether the organisation would reconsider Taiwan\u2019s membership, long objected to by Beijing. Aylward appeared not to hear Tong, and then either hung up on her or was disconnected. On Thursday Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for commerce and economic development, Edward Yau, accused RTHK of breaching its charter obligations which include \u201cpromoting understanding of the concept of \u2018One Country, Two Systems\u2019.\u201d \u201cThe Secretary holds the view that the presentation in that episode of the aforesaid programme has breached the One-China Principle and the purposes and mission of RTHK as a public service broadcaster as specified in the Charter,\u201d he said. Pro-Beijing legislator Junius Ho, labelled Tong\u2019s questions as \u201cdangerous\u201d. Taiwan\u2019s virus containment efforts are considered among the best globally, but it is increasingly critical over its exclusion from participating in the World Health Assembly and WHO emergency meetings and briefings because of heavy lobbying from China, which considers Taiwan part of its territory. RTHK said it had reviewed the interview and stood by it. RTHK advisory panel member, Fermi Wong, labelled it \u201cnonsense\u201d which may have come after pressure from the foreign ministry or Chinese Community Party. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand why when a reporter is asking something relating to health, she or he has to remember there is \u2018One Country, Two Systems\u2019 \u2026 in line with the government or China,\u201d she said. It comes amid growing concern over government overreach into press and civil liberties, which has enshrined rights and protections, including freedom of the press, in its Basic Law. On Thursday Hong Kong police won a court appeal which gave them broad powers to search the contents of an arrestee\u2019s phone without a warrant if an officer believed it necessary for their investigation. The city\u2019s police force which has faced accusations of brutality over recent months, were also accused of using social distancing rules to break up protest activity. They denied the accusation. The Hong Kong government is yet to confirm that it would allow the US journalists expelled by mainland China to work from Hong Kong despite Beijing\u2019s declaration they could not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
