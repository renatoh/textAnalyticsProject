I don't really like to travel for the sake of it. I taught physics for 40 years at Stonehill College in Massachusetts and most of my travel is to learn something or see something scientific or astronomical. That's one of the reasons why I live part of the year in the Bahamas - the clear, dark skies. I'm on a little island called Exuma in the central Bahamas away from Nassau. It's an idyllic place. My primary home is near Boston but the skies there have become overwhelmingly polluted with light. I live a tripartite life in Boston, the Bahamas and Ireland. Different friends, different food. The only thing that stays the same is my laptop! Has stargazing taken you abroad a great deal? It has always been a deep love of mine to look at the sky and the universe - I even wrote a book called 365 Starry Nights. I make trips to see particular things. I went to Australia to see Halley's Comet which was at its brightest in the southern hemisphere. We went into the Outback, where the skies are spectacularly clear, to watch the comet. In 1986 I went to the Black Sea to watch the total eclipse of the sun and next spring I will be going to Alexandria where part of my novel Valentine is set. I've never been there, so I'm looking forward to the visit. Alexandria was an astonishing place in terms of the history of science. How did you get into stargazing? I've been interested in the sky since I was a very young child. My father used to take me out and tell me stories about the constellations and stars. What he didn't know he made up. He filled the sky with wonder and it has been a big part of my life ever since. These days you can log into a telescope almost anywhere in the world over the internet, but my interest in the sky is with what can be seen with the naked eye - so any place away from large cities with a dark sky is great for stargazing. I spend a lot of time in the west of Ireland which is great for dark skies. But it can also be wonderfully cloudy though. In the early Seventies I was looking for a place I could go to write and study and we just picked Ireland out of the atlas. We fell in love with the place, then bought a house there and have been going back ever since. The Dingle peninsula is incredible. It's just a wonderful spot. The mountains and beaches are beautiful. I love hill walking and there are some great walks there. Until recently you could walk anywhere you wanted but like many places the farmers are becoming more antsy. England has a much older tradition of public footpaths. I've walked in England a lot. For my next book I walked across south-east England along the Greenwich meridian from Brighton to the Wash. For the history of science it's such a rich area. You couldn't pick a 100-mile walk anywhere else in the world that would come close. What is your next trip? At the moment my daughter is organising a trip to the north-west corner of Egypt to see the solar eclipse on 28 March next year. We'll go down the Nile and visit the pyramids and Aswan, but the real focus is the eclipse. You have to be in the right place at the right time. It sweeps right across central Africa and Turkey and you need to be somewhere near the centre line to get a good view. If you love the sky, there are certain things you have to travel to see. Total solar eclipses being one of them. \u00b7 Valentine by Chet Raymo is published by Brandon"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
