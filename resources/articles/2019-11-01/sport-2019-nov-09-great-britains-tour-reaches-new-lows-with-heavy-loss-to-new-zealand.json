The 69-year-old Australian, whose contract with the Rugby Football League expires next week, reckoned Great Britain\u2019s 23-8 defeat by New Zealand at Christchurch\u2019s OrangeTheory Stadium indicated \u2018we\u2019 - that\u2019s England - had regressed three years in their level of competitiveness. He had just seen Britain remain winless in their first three internationals since 2007, a South Pacific tour that has so far included one loss to Tonga and two to the Kiwis - who England beat 2-1 in a home series a year ago. \u201cWe\u2019re back to where we were in 2016 when I first came in as coach,\u201d said Bennett, again refusing to differentiate between the two entities. \u201cWe\u2019re not respecting the opposition enough with how much discipline we have to play with. \u201cI\u2019m not happy we\u2019re going backwards. I think we\u2019ve gone backwards a little bit from what last year and the World Cup year was, compared with how we\u2019ve played this series.\u201d Great Britain have so far managed just three tries in as many matches on tour. They were unfortunate to have a couple chalked off by the video referee on Saturday but that is not to say they deserved to win. With Warrington stand-off Blake Austin incongruously playing on the wing and making an early error that led to a Kiwi try, the Lions once more struggled to sustain pressure or execute opportunities from good ball. When the try did come, in the 51st minute, it was a result of a wonderful late off-load from substitute Josh Jones that allowed hooker Josh Hodgson to score untouched against a relaxed and puzzled defence. \u201cI just knew the ref hadn\u2019t called \u2018held\u2019,\u201d the Salford forward said later. Aside from that, the Kiwis just turned the screw as they constructed a workmanlike win. Centre Joey Manu held off two defenders to plant the ball over the line early, scrum-half Shaun Johnson reprised his 2013 World Cup light-footedness, winger Ken Maumalo was unconcerned his entire body aside from one forearm was outside the field of play when he touched down. And, playing in front of his terminally ill father, winger Jamayne Isaako tendered five goals and a drop goal. Bennett wants to stay on. Upset at his style of play, his selections and his seeming failure to grasp the concept of Great Britain, many fans think otherwise with one online poll giving him just two per cent of the popular vote over the weekend. \u201cNext year and the World Cup year are the prime years,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThere are a lot players here who haven\u2019t played before. There\u2019s a number of players, we\u2019ve tried a few new combinations so if we have to have a bit of a stumble, this is the year to do it in - not next year or the year after. \u201cI believe with all fit and everybody available .. we\u2019ve lost, obviously Sam (Burgess) and Sean O\u2019Loughlin, big losses for us \u2026 I believe the squad is stronger to get us through the next two years. \u201cOne thing that has affected us this year is we didn\u2019t have a mid-season Test and also our preparation wasn\u2019t long enough going into the Tonga game. \u201cEvery player in the New Zealand team, the Tongan team virtually, all play in the NRL. There\u2019s a standard in the NRL we\u2019ve got to come up to.\u201d Second rower John Bateman was reported for a high challenge on Maumalo. The tour concludes against Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby next Saturday. After a historic low of failing to make the World Cup semi-finals two years ago, New Zealand\u2019s revival continues. \u201cThe bottom line,\u201d Bennett concluded, \u201cis that New Zealand have played really well in the the last two games and we\u2019re just a little bit off the pace.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
