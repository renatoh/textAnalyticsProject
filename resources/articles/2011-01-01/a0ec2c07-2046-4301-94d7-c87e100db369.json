The 33-year-old has excelled at Craven Cottage since his \u00a32m move from Tottenham Hotspur in 2007 and has impressed the club's new management team this season. \"We are still talking but we are very hopeful that a deal will be concluded very quickly,\" the Fulham manager, Mark Hughes, said. \"There's a will to do it on both sides. Danny's a fit guy, leads his life well and there's no reason why he cannot play at the top level for a number of years.\" Shaun Wright-Phillips's proposed move from Manchester City to Fulham may depend on whether the midfielder is prepared to join the club on loan. Fulham favour a temporary deal whereas Wright-Phillips would prefer a permanent move."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
