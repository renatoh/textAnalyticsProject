On the day that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, confirmed that the quarantining period would last for at least a further three weeks, the Treasury said it was taking steps to help businesses with annual turnovers of more than \u00a345m \u2013 which are stuck in what has become known as the \u201csqueezed middle\u201d. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said that all viable businesses with turnover of \u00a345m-\u00a3250m would be able to apply for government-backed loans of up to \u00a325m. Firms with turnover of more than \u00a3250m will be allowed borrow up to \u00a350m from lenders. There is a separate scheme for even bigger companies. Those with an annual turnover of more than \u00a3500m were excluded when the chancellor first announced his plan to offer lenders a government guarantee of 80% on each loan in order to give them confidence to lend. Banks offering the loans are expected to work through the weekend so that the scheme is ready for Monday. Business groups have lobbied hard for all firms \u2013 no matter what their size \u2013 to be included in the CBILS (Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans Scheme, for firms whose cashflows have been hit by Covid-19), and the chancellor said he had listened to their concerns. Sunak said: \u201cI want to ensure that no viable business slips through our safety net of support as we help protect jobs and the economy. That is why we are expanding this generous scheme for larger firms. \u201cThis is a national effort and we\u2019ll continue to work with the financial services sector to ensure that our \u00a3330bn of government support, through loans and guarantees, reaches as many businesses in need as possible.\u201d The chancellor has been under pressure to act as evidence has mounted of the likely hit to the economy of the shutdown caused by the pandemic and the slow rate at which loan applications are being processed by banks. Earlier this week, the government\u2019s independent forecasting body \u2013 the Office for Budget Responsibility \u2013 predicted that the economy would shrink by 35% in the second quarter of 2020 and by 13% in the year as a whole. The Treasury is concerned that viable businesses will go to the wall without state support. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, a trade association for the banking and financial services sector, said: \u201cBanks and finance providers are committed to helping British businesses through these difficult times. \u201cWith over \u00a31.1bn already lent to small and medium-sized firms through the CBIL scheme, the launch of the new scheme for larger businesses will help to expand this support during these challenging economic conditions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
