Mosley announced in France last month that he would step down in October, one year early, but he has agreed to see out his term of office at the request of the FIA's senate which consists of eight of the body's most senior members. The FIA said: \"Following the FIA extraordinary general assembly on July 1 the senate unanimously called on Max Mosley to continue in office at least until the end of his mandate. The senate informed Mr Mosley that his early departure would damage the interests of the FIA. \"The senate, in London today, were informed by Max Mosley that he had received approaches from all sections of the FIA making the same points as the senate and, accordingly, feels bound to accede to the senate's request. He expressed his thanks for the confidence shown in him both by the senate and the full membership of the FIA.\" Mosley claimed that, after 13 years, he had grown bored with the politics of trying to run sports such as formula one and world rallying. But there is no obvious successor and it would appear doubts over the future leadership of the FIA have prompted his decision. Antonio Pizzonia, dumped by Jaguar last year, is poised for a formula one comeback with Williams at next week's German grand prix. The 23-year-old Brazilian has been put on standby after the Spaniard Marc Gene, the team's official reserve driver, failed to impress in the two races since Ralf Schumacher was sidelined by a crash at the US grand prix. \"All I know is that the team has told me to be ready,\" said Pizzonia. A Williams spokesman said a decision was likely after final testing at J\u00e9rez in southern Spain and it would be premature to say Pizzonia had secured the drive. Pizzonia was the fastest driver at J\u00e9rez on Thursday and Williams have kept faith in him despite his traumatic rookie season with Jaguar. The driver from Manaus - nicknamed Jungle Boy - joined Jaguar with a reputation as an extremely quick, if occasionally wild, racer but he failed to translate that speed into points. Williams are looking for two new drivers for next year since Schumacher will join Toyota and the Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya is going to McLaren. The team are fourth in the championship after three disappointing races and desperately need strong scoring finishes to hold off the resurgent McLaren. Their last win was at Hockenheim in August 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
