The achievement comes not with success on the field, but through the severity of proceedings behind closed doors at the Reebok Stadium. The FA will wonder just what it has done and, more significantly, what the consequences might be. The eight-month ban imposed on Rio Ferdinand by the three-man disciplinary commission transforms perceptions of the FA, even if it will make it even more reviled by Manchester United supporters and sympathisers of the England defender. The ruling body, all the same, will no longer be derided for bumbling and faint-heartedness. None of their counterparts have behaved in so draconian a fashion when dealing with an issue of this nature. The Italian Football Federation is, for example, admired for its streamlined procedures, yet the eventual outcome when the Lazio and former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam tested positive for nandrolone in 2001 was a suspension of just four months. The FA has therefore created a benchmark for the game across the globe and, in the process, it has hurled itself into unknown territory. United, for the time being, are simply stunned to find themselves in an alien environment. Their hostile examination of the drug-testing procedures of UK Sport have been entirely ignored by Barry Bright and the other two members of the disciplinary commission. Last night, it looked as if the Old Trafford club had enjoyed no return whatsoever on their investment in the legal team headed by Ronald Thwaites QC. Once they have regained their equilibrium, though, United will also recover faith in solicitors' powers of advocacy since even those who loathe the Premiership champions appreciate that the level of controversy in this treatment of Ferdinand could not be higher. Maurice Watkins, the club's director and legal adviser, called the judgment \"savage and unprecedented\". The first adjective was emotive, the second cut to the heart of the matter. Earlier this year, Manchester City's Christian Negouai was fined \u00a32,000 after he had omitted to provide a sample for the testers. In itself, a variation in punishment will not embarrass the FA. It will never admit publicly to being at fault, but privately it could concede that it was simply in error when handling Negouai's offence. Having been lax once, the FA cannot conceivably be obliged to remain feckless for the rest of its existence. The difficulty arises from the outlandishness of the contrast. In addition to being fined 25 times more than a French midfielder in another part of Manchester, Ferdinand is to receive a suspension just a month shorter than that imposed on Mark Bosnich after he had been found to have taken cocaine. The change of direction is assumed to stem from the arrival of the new chief executive Mark Palios at the FA. He made it clear from the start that he wanted a much firmer policy in disciplinary matters. Whether the expression of a personal wish is enough to justify a revolution, however, is open to debate. It would have been far preferable if the new code that is currently being drafted had been published before someone like Ferdinand sparked such uproar. In their appeal, United can insist vehemently that there is no basis for the crushing of the defender's life. For the moment, the FA has relieved some of the pressures bearing down on it. The president of Fifa Sepp Blatter had indicated that he would increase any penalty on Ferdinand that he judged to be lenient, but Palios need no longer fear to pick up any letter from the Soho Square doormat that carries a Zurich postmark. The authority of the FA has been reasserted, even though the Professional Footballers' Association and United will believe it has been used to victimise Ferdinand. The club will be even more enraged as it reflects on the context of an appeal. It will be heard again by figures from within the football community who will be reluctant to stray too far from yesterday's verdict. That factor may impel the club towards considering legal action, despite the apocalyptic possibility that raises of their being thrown out of football by Fifa. Certainly, no one can argue any longer that United have undue influence. The cosy theory can no longer hold that they had dragged out the Ferdinand affair so that he would drop out of the team - briefly - in January, while Sir Alex Ferguson used the transfer window to bring in a stop-gap. Nothing has gone United's way. Further delay that ended with the upholding of the original sentence will see Ferdinand missing until the end of 2004. Considering a plc's responsibilty to the shareholders, the Old Trafford board have to find the wisest way to sustain the value of a \u00a330m asset. The man himself will not be at Euro 2004. There is sorrow over that, but the blame is inescapable. From the one-year drink-driving ban as a teenager in 1997 to the six-month punishment for speeding this year and on to the forgetfulness towards drug-testers, he has been the epitome of the irresponsible, man-child who typifies contemporary football. Only yesterday did it become possible to feel faintly sorry for him. Modern bad boys Mark Bosnich - 9 months The former Chelsea goalkeeper tested positive for cocaine in November 2002. He claimed that his drink had been spiked but an appeal failed and he completed his worldwide ban in September. Eric Cantona - 8 months Manchester United's French international was banned following his flying assault on a Crystal Palace fan in January 1995. The club suspended him until the end of the season and fined him \u00a320,000. The FA extended the ban to September 30 and fined him a further \u00a310,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
