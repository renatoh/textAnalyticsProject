First came the fire alarm at their hotel that led to them being shaken from their slumber at 7am. Then came a well-worked United corner routine that resulted in a ruled-out goal - a warning the visitors failed to heed. As the opening half, in which Chelsea had for the most part been the equal of their hosts, drew to a close, they conceded a corner. Wayne Rooney nudged the ball onto the pitch, before sauntering off, allowing Ryan Giggs to stroll casually over as if he was supposed to take the corner all along. Then, as Chelsea's players arranged themselves, presuming the ball to be out of play, Giggs whipped a cross to Ronaldo who headed the ball authoritatively home. However, either both referee Howard Webb and his assistant failed to understand the trick or Rooney's failure to explain it to them in advance meant the subsequent goal was ruled out. It was a lucky escape for Chelsea, whose frailty at set-pieces is quickly becoming problematic, but United's bad luck was redressed moments later. From the re-take Chelsea stood frozen as Dimitar Berbatov rose to flick on to Nemanja Vidic, who had arrived unmarked at the far post to tuck the ball away. What had been a tightly contested game, in which Deco pulled the strings for the visitors in the opening quarter while Dimitar Berbatov wasted the home side's best chance on the 30 minute mark, became a far more open affair in the second half. Nicolas Anelka's half-time arrival, replacing Deco, left United with more room to manoeuvre and so it was that Ronaldo was able to engineer himself some space on the left flank. After toying with Chelsea right-back Jose Bosingwa, the Portuguese back-heeled to the overlapping Evra. His cross whistled past Berbatov's forehead before Wayne Rooney toe-poked the ball past Cech, despite being apparently stranded behind an impotent Ashley Cole. The game was one the Chelsea manager claimed was must-win before the kick-off but, with Jose Mourinho looking on from the stands, their chances became ever-more limited. It was a former Mourinho favourite who was presented with the best of them. Yet, from the first Didier Drogba sliced the ball into touch for a throw-in, from the second he swiped an air-shot with only Edwin van der Sar to beat. From there, Chelsea seemed to slump into torpor. Rooney, his performance galvanised by his goal, was an ever more irritating thorn in their side. But it was Ronaldo who saw another goal disallowed after a marginal offside decision went in Chelsea's favour. But, by then, the game was finished - so much so that Dimitar Berbatov's 86th minute strike, tapping home from a Ronaldo free-kick, was just the icing on the cake. Again it was a goal made on the flanks, again it was a cross that scuppered Chelsea. The result lifts Manchester United back above Aston Villa into third but leaves Chelsea four points astray of Liverpool in second."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
