On 21 October, less than two weeks before election day, US intelligence and law enforcement officials convened a last-minute press conference to warn that foreign adversaries were once again interfering in American democracy. Iran was spreading false tales about \u201callegedly fraudulent ballots\u201d and sending spoofed emails purporting to contain threats from the Proud Boys, \u201cdesigned to intimidate voters, incite social unrest and damage President Trump\u201d, said John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence. Meanwhile, both Russia and Iran had obtained access to voter information that could be used to \u201ccause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy\u201d, he warned. It was everything that Democrats and disinformation experts have been warning about for the last four years, except, well, not quite. The email operation had been relatively small and immediately debunked, while voter roll information is either public or easy to obtain. Senior intelligence officials quickly raised doubts about Ratcliffe\u2019s emphasis on the threat from Iran over Russia and questioned whether his motives for the public announcement were political, the New York Times reported. \u201cIt was very difficult to see those men in suits talking about interference in the election when the White House is the one interfering with the election,\u201d said Claire Wardle, the executive director of First Draft, a group that researches and combats disinformation. After all, when it comes to intimidating voters or inciting social unrest, nothing has had more impact than the constant drumbeat of lies and disinformation from Donald Trump. Years of preparation by the press, social media platforms, and civil society groups for a foreign interference campaign against the US electoral process have been upended by the bizarre reality that the biggest threat to American democracy right now is almost certainly the commander-in-chief, and that his primary mode of attack is a concerted disinformation campaign. Because how much impact can a few thousand faked emails telling voters in Florida and Alaska to \u201cvote for Trump or else\u201d have on voters compared with Trump directly ordering the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist street gang, to \u201cstand back and stand by\u201d before a television audience of 73 million people? And what kind of false tale of voter fraud could Iran possibly seed that could undermine Americans\u2019 faith in the electoral process more than the disinformation about voter fraud and mail-in ballots coming straight from the White House and Trump\u2019s campaign? \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t trust the electoral system, don\u2019t trust the CDC, don\u2019t trust your neighbor because they\u2019re probably antifa, don\u2019t trust the left,\u2019\u201d Wardle said of Trump\u2019s re-election message. \u201cIt\u2019s not about persuading people one way or the other, it\u2019s about making them scared and causing confusion and chaos,\u201d she added. \u201cThe media\u2019s been obsessed with Russians under the bed, but to have the president of the United States telling people in the US that they can\u2019t trust the results of the election \u2013 Putin could only dream of that kind of thing.\u201d Social media tactics Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign in the 2016 presidential election had two main vectors: a social media campaign to sow division and distrust among voters, and a \u201chack and leak\u201d operation that resulted in the theft and publication of emails and documents stolen from Democrats and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. That hack and leak operation was incredibly successful, with caches of stolen material proving irresistible both for the mainstream press and for conservative activists and conspiracy theorists. The 2020 iteration of the hack and leak tactic \u2013 Trump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani pushing dubious emails and text messages supposedly obtained from a hard drive linked to Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter \u2013 has been something of a damp squib, however. \u201cYou don\u2019t see the same kind of credulous, knee-jerk out-of-control amplification that you saw in 2016,\u201d said Whitney Phillips, a professor at Syracuse University and author of The Oxygen of Amplification, a report examining how the press served the purposes of media manipulators, trolls and hate groups in 2016. The top newspapers have debunked and deflated Giuliani\u2019s claims, and the idea of the pilfered hard drive has failed to capture the public\u2019s interest in the same way that troves of stolen emails did. But while the Trump re-election campaign may have failed to recapture the magic of 2016 when it comes to hacked emails, the president has taken Russia\u2019s 2016 social media playbook and supercharged it with the power of the White House. \u201cI\u2019m sure that there is some foreign influence stuff happening and we might know more about it later,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cBut so much of the pollution is trickling down from the White House itself, and people have been absolutely overwhelmed with falsehoods and confusion over Covid and ballots \u2026 When people get overwhelmed, they either fight or flee. [Trump] is making it almost impossible for people not to get totally burned out and disgusted.\u201d This year\u2019s disinformation efforts on social media have taken aim at familiar societal fault lines. Both Russian operatives and the Trump campaign in 2016 targeted Black voters with messages designed to depress enthusiasm for Clinton and suppress their votes. Similar efforts, especially those targeting Black women, are under way this election, said Shireen Mitchell, a disinformation researcher and founder of Stop Online Violence Against Women. \u201cThere are groups working to basically remove us from the Democratic party, and tell us a story that matches what we\u2019re going through, speaks our language,\u201d said Mitchell of campaigns such as \u201cBlexit\u201d and Walk Away. One version of Black voter suppression that Mitchell is monitoring encourages people to #VoteDownBallot but abstain from voting for either presidential candidate because \u201cboth candidates are the same\u201d, often alongside the hashtag #ADOS, which stands for American Descendants of Slaves. Jacobo Licona, a disinformation researcher for Equis Labs, said he was tracking prominent far-right Latino Facebook pages pushing false information about voting and anti-Black Lives Matter messages. Efforts to paint Biden as a \u201csocialist\u201d are also particularly effective among Cuban and Venezuelan immigrant communities, he noted. The false idea that Biden is a socialist or communist is also a tactic in messages targeting some Asian American voters. One apparently effective attack suggesting that Biden had opposed accepting refugees after the Vietnam war spread like wildfire within the Vietnamese American community. The source of the canard appeared to be a Washington Examiner article that was published in 2019 but went viral on Facebook in October. (Biden did support allowing Vietnamese refugees to come the US, while Trump has attacked all forms of immigration, including reducing the number of refugees admitted each year to an all-time low.) \u201cOlder Vietnamese were especially angry about that,\u201d said Thu Quach, an epidemiologist who helped to found Pivot, a progressive, volunteer organization fighting misinformation among Vietnamese Americans through a bilingual fact-check website. \u201cIt takes a lot of deep work to continue these conversations because it\u2019s so deeply embedded to be anti-communist, and [conservatives] feed off that to paint Biden and Harris as communists.\u201d Tech platforms, after belatedly and begrudgingly admitting their tools had been used to ill ends in 2016, have made reforms that make some of the old tactics obsolete. The Trump campaign\u2019s 2016 use of Facebook to target Black voters with voting \u201cdeterrence\u201d messages, recently confirmed by a Channel 4 investigation, is the kind of digital dirty trickery that should no longer be possible. Such reforms may be one reason Trump has been so openly fanning the flames of political violence, whether through his debate message to the Proud Boys or his call for his supporters to become \u201cpoll watchers\u201d, said Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. \u201cThey\u2019ve had to adapt to a more mass media strategy,\u201d she said of the Trump campaign. \u201cIf you can\u2019t utilize those other mechanisms, then you have to use the megaphone.\u201d Trump\u2019s blatant racism and ugly attacks on Black women, including the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, and the congresswoman Ilhan Omar, could also have the effect of suppressing turnout among Black voters, Phillips said, simply by demoralizing people and inducing despair. \u201cIf certain people feel just crushed under the weight of so much bullshit, [Trump] is going to be the one to benefit,\u201d she said. Controlling the narrative Even as volunteers like Quach work to fight false narratives and voter confusion ahead of election day, however, experts warn that the greatest scope for disinformation may still be to come. The surge in mail-in ballots is likely to delay the final results, and Trump has repeatedly telegraphed his intention to declare premature victory \u2013 or dismiss the election as \u201crigged\u201d. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to look back at 2020 and realize that it\u2019s all going to play out from 11.30pm on Tuesday,\u201d said Wardle. \u201cMisinformation flourishes when there\u2019s a vacuum or confusion, and my fear is that there will be a lot of confusion and whoever succeeds in controlling the narrative will be very well placed.\u201d In 2000, Al Gore never fully recovered from television networks\u2019 premature declaration that George W Bush had won Florida, Wardle noted. \u201cThat made all the difference,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that Trump\u2019s closest circle is ready to deploy. We know that the militias are ready to deploy. What we don\u2019t know is if newsrooms are ready for the absence of information,\u201d Wardle added. \u201cEvery newsroom should be very, very careful about what they publish, because they are going to become tools in the fight, and it\u2019s going to be nasty.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
