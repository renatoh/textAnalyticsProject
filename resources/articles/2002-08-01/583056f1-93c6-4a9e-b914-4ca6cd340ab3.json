After his liver transplant George Best was, according to reports, \"awake and recognising his family\". Dennis Wise, meanwhile, deftly timed his run into a gap left on the sports pages by the end of the World Cup and the start of the Scottish Premier League season (the midfielder's sacking by Leicester provoked one headline - \"Dennis Wise Is Appealing\" - that will rank as the most unlikely of all time unless future front pages announce \"Great War Was A Hoax, Secret Government Papers Reveal\" or \"Simon Lessing Doesn't Disappoint\"). And Paul Gascoigne expressed his determination to put US football \"on the map\" (insert your own \"probably of New Zealand\" gag here). Sadly, the US looks likely to turn its back on Gazza, despite his selfless display during the World Cup (who else could have left viewers begging for the wit and insight of Andy Townsend?). The men who run Major League Soccer are apparently worried that the Geordie midfielder's behaviour might tarnish the game's image. Personally, I would have thought that having a bit of the shine rubbed off it by a few well-chosen belches and expletives was just what soccer needed if it is finally to succeed Stateside. No fan likes his or her game to be too highly polished. One has only to witness the new-found interest in ice dance that has been created by the bold decision to bring the Russian mafia in to help with the judging to see how a really good scandal captures the sporting public's imagination. Home-grown US players have let the administrators down rather badly in this department. Despite having taken massive strides over the past decade the MLS has failed to produce any player who looks capable of sinking a skinful and then driving across a golf course trying to run over rabbits in the manner of the marvellous Mark Dennis, or writing off a borrowed car during a drive to the newsagents as the excellent \"Vodka\" Vic Kasule did during his time at Shrewsbury. The best the US has come up with is Alexi Lalas, whose claim to maverick status rested solely on the fact that he played guitar in a rock band and looked like Catweasel. Low-tar stuff indeed. Not, I should hasten to add, that I believe American athletes are incapable of behaving with complete disregard for \"all the millions of youngsters watching at home who will be influenced by this\". Far from it. In many ways US sportsmen have set standards of bad behaviour that are a shining beacon, a city on a hill, if you will, for the Craig Bellamys of the world to gaze at and draw inspiration from. If the hierarchy of the MLS needs any proof of the value of squeezing lemon juice on the chrome-work they have only to examine America's favourite sports. It was the dangerously loopy Ty Cobb who helped propel baseball to the status of national institution during the first three decades of the 20th Century. Cobb sometimes slept with a revolver under his pillow, claimed to have stabbed a man to death in a street fight and was described by Lou Gehrig as being \"about as welcome in American ballparks as rattlesnakes\". The Dallas Cowboys played a full part in the NFL's inexorable march towards dominance of the TV schedules during the 1960s and 70s. When it comes to lustre-diminution \"America's Team\" achieved levels that oxidisation can only dream of. The Cowboys' consumption of amphetamines was said to be such that at training camp there were two coffee dispensers, one marked \"leaded\" and the other \"unleaded\", and the team boasted several players for whom the 10-yard line was not just a field marking but also a night's entertainment. No wonder viewers keep tuning in. The aptly monikered Wilt \"The Stilt\" Chamberlain, meanwhile, did a fine job in scouring the sheen off basketball by confessing (albeit in a very-loud-voice-in-a-crowded-pub sort of way) that he had slept with 20,000 women. The sport hasn't looked back since (except to see if any husbands were chasing after it, obviously). These are tough acts to emulate, but if the MLS is serious about breaking into the mainstream it is going to take bold action. Call me a sentimental old patriot if you like, but I feel confident that if called upon our boys Gazza, Wisey and co would be more than capable of lowering their game to meet the challenge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
