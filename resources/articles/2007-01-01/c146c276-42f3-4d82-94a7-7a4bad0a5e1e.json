The move is the first time in the chain's 129-year history that it has taken on travel, and experts believe it could presage a flood of big-name high-street retailers moving into the sector. Sales at the firm's high-street stores have been falling, but on Friday it unveiled the new strategy with bullish comments about 'using massive marketing power to take on established firms such as Lastminute.com and Expedia'. The plans revolve around using the Woolworths website to sell discounted hotels, flights and packages from tour operators, but Woolies' bosses are also talking about using their shops. 'We have 821 locations that we can utilise, some of them very large stores,' said a spokesman. 'Travel is a booming market and internet technology is allowing us to get into business areas that traditionally we haven't been able to get into at a low price.' Opening offers included a three-day city break to New York including flights for \u00a3429, a return flight to Dubai for \u00a3241 and a return to Las Vegas for \u00a3298. The website will be operated by a third-party company called PPA. Already there are signs that holidays will soon be sold through a far more diverse range of outlets than the traditional travel agent. Tesco and Asda are selling holidays on their websites, with Tesco's operated by Lastminute and Asda's by wefly.co.uk. Meanwhile the travel agents themselves are diversifying in the face of competition from the internet. Earlier this month, for example, First Choice announced it will open mini-outlets in Waterstone's shops and Morrisons supermarkets, on top of existing concessions in some larger branches of Sainsbury's and Asda. In March, Thomson will launch its latest concept - the 'travel pod'. Taking up less than 3 sq m of space, it will be put in shopping centres around the country. Inside will be an internet booking system, and staff will be on hand to help shoppers use it. Thomson believe the pods will be very popular among those without access to the internet at home or in the office, or who feel nervous about using it unassisted. Lastminute.com was unperturbed by Woolworths' announcement. 'We welcome any competition. However, it will be interesting to see whether people will want to buy a holiday from the people they buy their pick'n'mix from,' said travel director John Bevan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
