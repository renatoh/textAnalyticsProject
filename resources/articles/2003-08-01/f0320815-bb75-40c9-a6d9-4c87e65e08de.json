Rugman, a former foreign correspondent for the Guardian and the Observer, is expected to take up his new role soon after Smith's last day on September 26. Smith, whose quirky conversational two-ways with anchor Jon Snow became an integral part of Channel 4 News, has been covering the ins and outs of the US political life for 10 years. He announced earlier this year he intended to step down as Washington correspondent to spend more time with his family and to focus on his teaching commitments, lecturing on the media and politics. Smith joined ITN in 1975 as Africa correspondent. He later won a Royal Television Society Award for his coverage of the Beirut war, becoming Middle East correspondent in 1984. He joined Channel 4 News in 1987, five years after the channel launched. Famous for his relaxed delivery, Smith has reported on three presidential elections. He was also instrumental in providing an American angle during the Iraq war. In January he landed an interview with the US secretary of state, Colin Powell. Rugman's arrival in Washington coincides with a number of other changes at Channel 4 News. Jonathan Miller, a former BBC correspondent, joins as foreign correspondent. Miller, who has also worked for CNN, was not expected to join Channel 4 News until November. But, landing in Jordan last night, he delivered a report on the bombing of the UN compound in Baghdad. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
