The proposition squeaked by with 50.4% of the total votes as of Thursday night. This is the first time American voters have ever weighed in on reintroducing a wildlife species, as that decision is usually left up to a state\u2019s team of wildlife biologists. Gray wolves once roamed across two-thirds of the continental US. Without wolves at the top of the food chain, the whole ecosystem is out of balance, says Eric Washburn, a campaign manager at the Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund, the advocacy group behind the proposition. Yellowstone national park reintroduced gray wolves to the park in 1995, and Washburn looks to it as a living laboratory and model for Colorado\u2019s reintroduction plans. The return of the region\u2019s apex predators set off a cascade of natural events that ultimately restored Yellowstone\u2019s \u201cecological integrity\u201d, says Washburn, and the reintroduction is hailed as one of the world\u2019s greatest rewilding stories. Wolves were first listed as endangered 45 years ago, when the population dropped to 1,000 individuals in the continental 48 states. Now it sits at about 6,000. Colorado\u2019s decision is complicated by the fact that just last week, the Trump administration delisted gray wolves from the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) after announcing the species\u2019 \u201csuccessful recovery\u201d. Hundreds of biologists dispute this, in part because wolves still only occupy a sliver of their historic range. States will now decide if wolves can be hunted or trapped. And since wildlife cannot recognize state lines, wolves can move in and out of states where they can be killed, thwarting conservation efforts. For example, the gray wolf is endangered in Colorado but only threatened in Wyoming, where wolves can be killed on sight in 85% of the state. Last year, at least three wolves from north-west Colorado were killed when they moved into Wyoming. \u201cWe do worry about that, but there\u2019s not a whole lot we can do about that because wolves will go where they see habitat,\u201d said Washburn. \u201cBut the good news is, there\u2019s 17m acres of public land habitat in western Colorado.\u201d Washburn also hopes that the decision to delist wolves from the Endangered Species Act will be overturned by a federal court."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
