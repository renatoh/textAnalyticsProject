I climbed the ladder myself. To begin with, I was scared, but when I climbed the ladder, the Iraqis started clapping, even the American soldiers. I heard them saying nice things about me. I couldn't reach Saddam's head, but by that time there was no fear. I was sure we'd got rid of him.\" In the end, he says, he managed to sling the noose around the dictator's neck. \"I felt so strong then. I wasn't scared of him any more. My job was finished and, as the leader of our country, so was Saddam.\" Hamid says: \"We weren't able to catch Saddam himself, so the statue had to stand in. I was happy. I was proud. I know that even President Bush was watching us.\" But the pride was tinged with revulsion. \"To be honest, I was upset about the Americans coming. Nobody accepted the occupation. But we were ready to be allied with the Jews, with Satan, just to get rid of Saddam.\" In fact Fares and Hamid played their part in Saddam's downfall long before they helped to topple the statue. They were both deserters from the Iraqi army. Fares, who is 21, fled his unit, which was based in Tikrit, on the same day that he joined it. His friend Hamid, who is 10 years older, was more organised. His unit was based on the Kurdish front, north of Baghdad. Hamid never turned up. All he had to do was go to the Baghdad home of his commanding officer every once in a while and deposit a no show fee of 50,000 dinars (about $30). \"Saddam was a pain in the arse,\" observes Fares, a wary, diffident man who runs a tea shack behind the modern blocks of flats that overlook Firdous Square, where Saddam's statue stood. Hamid lives around the corner. A year later, Fares does not regret what he did, but he is not happy with the way things have worked out. It is hard graft in the tea shack. The kettle hisses on the hob and deafening music squawks from a radio, but there are not many takers for tea, and the half-dozen ornate hookahs go unhired. \"We're depressed and we're frustrated,\" says Fares. \"We thought the coalition forces came here for reconstruction, for the prosperity of the people. It hasn't happened. I was glad to get rid of Saddam, but that doesn't mean I like the Americans. I don't regret pulling down his statue, because if I hadn't done it somebody else would have, but if the situation had remained as it was under Saddam I personally would have been better off now.\" Fares' complaint is characteristic of Iraqis; high expectations unfulfilled, and an unending affront to their dignity. Fares lives with his mother and stepfather. He wants more money. He wants a car. Most of all, he wants to be able to go and work in Europe, but besides the fact that Europe does not want him, the temporary travel documents that the Coalition Provisional Authority is issuing are not valid for crossing any border. Since the international bonhomie of April 9, Fares hasn't met any Americans. \"Even if they passed me by, I wouldn't wave at them,\" he says. \"They are in the same position as we are. They are scared of us, and we are scared of them.\" Hamid, who has trained to be a sports schoolteacher, is unemployed. He is as ambivalent a year after the toppling of the statue as he was at the time. His immediate response when asked how his life has changed since April 9, is to say that it has improved, for one reason: his brother Raed Hamid, an engineer, has found a good job in the postwar oil industry in Basra. His salary has increased tenfold, to more than $150, which supports the family of four unmarried sons and their parents. I visit the Hamid family house on the day of the bombings in Kerbala and Baghdad, which left scores of people dead. The Hamids are Shias. Khaled says that he was supposed to have gone to Kerbala, but the car didn't turn up. Khaled has a scratch on his nose from their cat, Kuti, who was born on the day the statue fell. Their house is an unlived-in space that looks as if it were offices until recently; the family say they rent it from the religious affairs ministry. There is a suspicious mound of fire extinguishers and old pipeline parts in the garden. The Hamids say that they are just looking after them for a friend. Khaled talks about his life since the day the statue fell. He occasionally goes to the education ministry to ask if it has jobs for sports teachers, but it says it does not have the money. In October, he went down to Basra as he had heard the British there were handing out back pay to demobbed soldiers. He witnessed a riot in which the British were attacked by hundreds of former soldiers, and they mistakenly shot a school watchman who they thought was firing at them. \"It was a hell of chaos,\" he says, sitting cross-legged on a fine rug. Raed Hamid, who also witnessed the fall of the statue, is there, too, on leave from his job. \"I think our country is like other countries occupied after wars, like Germany, like Japan,\" he says. \"What happened in this year happened in those countries, definitely ... what I need from Iraqis is for them to be patient. Everything isn't going to calm down in a moment.\" Khaled says: \"The Americans should leave our country, but I'm 100% sure they're not going to. They came all this way. They experienced all that sacrifice, lost hundreds of men and spent so much money. Do you think they will leave this country so easily? No. There will be American bases outside our cities.\" Later, Khaled takes me across the road to visit a friend, Hussein Abdul Bari Obeid, whose house was broken into by US troops on a raid on Eid, the last day of Ramadan. Khaled went to see if he could help, but the soldiers warned him off. \"They started shouting 'Go! Go! Leave this area!',\" he says. \"I wasn't in a position to tell them that I was one of the ones who had toppled the statue. There were machine guns pointed at my head.\" Obeid explains what happened to him. Three American soldiers entered the yard, told Obeid and his friends to put their hands up while they searched for weapons, took hold of Obeid's chin, moved his head from side to side, and ordered him to take his shirt off and stand facing the wall. He refused. He was handcuffed and taken into the street. Against a background of screaming, weeping and protesting by the family, male and female, the Americans broke into the house and searched it, finding two Kalashnikovs, which they confiscated, although Obeid insisted he needed at least one for his job as watchman at a car park. \"After that, the American officer untied me. I didn't say anything. They wrote some words on my forearm, three lines: the day, the date, the kind of weapon, the serial number. Then the officer said: 'Happy Eid!' And he left.\" Later, another US unit came through with a kind of \"How's my driving?\" mopping-up operation, asking locals whether the first unit had treated them courteously. They handed out leaflets with an Arabic translation of a speech by George Bush talking about the spirit of peace and love in Ramadan. \"Well, they gave me this paper, but they hadn't respected their own president,\" says Obeid. \"They went into my house with their shoes on and they pointed a gun at my mother. That wasn't done under Saddam. We were repressed, and now we're going to be repressed again.\" JM The officer Marine Lieutenant Casey Kuhlman When the definitive history of the war is written, Marine Lieutenant Casey TK Kuhlman would like to add a tiny codicil on how, inadvertently, a grave insult was done to Iraqi honour on what should have been a joyous day, and how that wrong was set to rights. Actually, Kuhlman is writing the story himself. He says he has a six-figure advance for a war memoir, based on his time with a marine sniper outfit. At its core will be the story of two flags: American and Iraqi. Both were draped across Saddam Hussein's bronze features that day. Both were invested with enormous meaning because of the gaggle of television cameras in the square that day. A heedless gesture from a group of marines turned into a symbol of conquest and occupation. Kuhlman says he has the inside story. He screamed into Firdous Square that afternoon in a Humvee, narrowly ahead of a column of tanks. He was with a sniper unit, and had been briefed to expect brutal street battles. \"We were thinking Grozny, Stalingrad, street-to-street, door-to-door, window-to-window fighting,\" he says. \"Then we started looking around and asking where everybody is at. I kept thinking we were getting sucked into an ambush. We were 100% ready.\" It soon became apparent, however, that Kuhlman could take his guard down. He settled back with his men, and watched the scenes unfold. The sky flickered with the flash of dozens of cameras. He watched Iraqis gather their strength to approach and practise their English. He tried to work out the difference between Iraqi local time and the most heavily watched slots on the American network news programmes. For the first time in the war, Kuhlman was living in the moment. So were the marines. After three weeks in the desert, having been the advance troops of the US military for virtually the entire war, the Third Battalion/Fourth Regiment were feeling that they deserved a trophy of some sort. The great bronze statue of Saddam was the obvious prize. An hour or so after the troops pulled into the square, they hitched a tank-recovery vehicle up to the giant statue of the Iraqi dictator, and were preparing to drag him off his perch. In their exuberance, the marines handed up an American flag, which fluttered down over Saddam's head. The flag was there for barely a minute, but the message had been registered: Iraq was under occupation. Kuhlman had his back to the statue at that point, but he felt a sudden change in the mood. \"I heard a kind of a collective gasp from the crowd and I turned around and saw an American flag go up and for about a split second I thought: 'That's cool.' And then I thought: 'Oh my goodness, that's not cool at all.' \" Several people in the crowd had a similar reaction. Kuhlman remembers a woman correspondent for a Middle Eastern television company begging the marines to take it down, as well as angry mutters and scattered shouts from Iraqis. The stars and stripes was already being plucked from Saddam's head when Kuhlman had his moment of inspiration. During his travels up to Baghdad, he had somehow come to possess an Iraqi flag - he is reluctant to reveal exactly where. \"I had seen out of the corner of my eye they were already starting to take it down,\" he says, \"but I thought: 'I've got something that should do the crowd OK.' This was going to make a much better memory.\" He handed the flag through the crowd. Although Kuhlman didn't realise it at the time, the tricolour was an old version of the flag, without the line of Arabic script across the centre stripe, reading God is Great. The addition had been ordered by Saddam after the first Gulf war, a time when he regularly made shows of piety to try to give some legitimacy to his regime. For the Iraqis in the square, the return of the old flag was redolent with feeling. Saddam's craven exploitation of nation and faith was being undone. Also unbeknown to Kuhlman, the American flag that had been draped over the statue also had an impressive pedigree. Its owner, Lieutenant Tim McLaughlin, had worked at the Pentagon, and had just left to go jogging when the building was hit in the September 11 terror attacks. From across the Potomac river, McLaughlin heard two faint thuds. \"I turned around and looked at the Pentagon and saw what appeared to me to be a mushroom cloud,\" he says. The next day, a family friend handed him a flag. McLaughlin treated it like a treasure. When the time came to go to war, he folded it into a box wrapped with duct tape, and stored it at the very bottom of his tank, waiting for the day when he could get his picture taken with it on Iraqi soil. He had tried to raise it twice before. The first time, he was shot at, and the other occasion the flag pole snapped. He was running out of time - and film - when the company commander, Captain Bryan Lewis, came by, asking McLaughlin if he wanted to have another go at putting up his flag. McLaughlin handed it over. One year on, Kuhlman has no idea what became of his flag. McLaughlin, who is at a marine base in California, keeps his folded next to his books. Both men are unapologetic about the gaffe with the flags. Kuhlman sees no contradiction between the scenes of joy on that day, and Iraq's descent into a bloody guerrilla war. \"I think it meant more to the Iraqi people than it meant to us,\" he says. \"To me, personally, it was more of a participating in history moment ... to me, it was just a bronze statue. It wasn't a regime I was pulling down at that moment in time.\" But it still remains one of his most cherished memories of the war, and of a phase in Kuhlman's life that is now categorically over. After returning from Iraq, he left the marines and, at 27, is on the verge of building a new life. Kuhlman was always a bit of an unusual candidate for the marine corps. He graduated from high school with a smattering of prizes, and seemed cut out for college, and a professional career. But in America, military service comes with significant sweeteners - including assistance with college tuition. At the University of Illinois, where he studied structural engineering, Kuhlman went into the officer reserves. The summer after his first year he went off to train with the US navy. He came back convinced that he wanted to be a marine, but not merely for the action-man lifestyle. He wanted to develop leadership skills, to round himself out. After leaving the marine corps in June, Kuhlman spent the winter working at a ski resort in northern California. Now he is calculating his next move. He has his book to finish. Then he would like to start his own business in adventure tourism. If that doesn't work, he will go to law school. The events in Baghdad seem like another lifetime now. Some of his friends who stayed in the marine corps are back in Iraq, and Kuhlman knows that some of them may not return. The moment that was to symbolise the end of a regime instead set the switch from a conventional conflict to a guerrilla war. In that sense, the momentary kerfuffle with the American flag, and the symbolism of conquest and occupation, was perhaps prescient. But Kuhlman says that for him, nothing will ever erode the positive memories of that day. \"You can't touch a moment in time,\" he says. \"Even if Iraq were to fall all to hell, it would not negate the powerfulness of that moment.\" SG The strongman Kadhem Sharif On April 9 2003, as Saddam's regime disintegrated in Baghdad, friends pleaded with Kadhem Sharif \"al-Yabani\" Hussen to use his famous strength to help them break open safety deposit boxes in nearby banks. He refused, he explains, because there was something else he wanted to do. Stripped to a black vest, taut over his enormous muscles, he took a 10kg (22lb) sledgehammer and drove the few hundred metres to Firdous Square, where the now infamous statue of Saddam Hussein stood. Wielding the hammer with ease, he swung it at the tiled plinth supporting the dictator. The tiles shattered like biscuits. The rage of years flowed through al-Yabani's arms. It was the first blow against the statue - even before the US tanks entered the square, he says. \"Sometimes I wake up suddenly in the night and I can't believe Saddam's gone, because I'm always dreaming about him,\" he says. \"Saddam sent me to jail. He killed 11 of my relatives. I couldn't control myself ... At that moment, I felt Saddam himself was there. With every blow of my hammer, I wanted him to be there. But if he had been there, I wouldn't have used the hammer. My hands would have been enough.\" So passionate was al-Yabani's wielding of the hammer that his palms bled. When the Americans arrived, they tended his wounds. \"After that, one of the American soldiers climbed the statue and got the American flag, and at that time I told him: 'No,we should find our own Iraqi flag.' So I brought an Iraqi flag and put it on the head of the statue.\" Hussen is known in Baghdad as \"al-Yabani\", \"the Japanese\", because of his skill with Japanese motorcycles. Bikes are a large part of his life; the other part is wrestling and bodybuilding. He is a strongman, deputy coach of the Iraqi national wrestling team. He is also a bit of a dandy. When I turn up unannounced at his bike garage in a Baghdad backstreet he is wearing a white bomber jacket and white trousers. Gradually, after April 9, Hussen became pleasantly aware of the way television and newspapers around the world had turned his actions into part of a sacramental event. He shows me a sheaf of cuttings from English language news magazines showing his face creased in effort as he swings his hammer. He describes how an American raid on his garage, hunting for weapons, turned friendly when the US commander discovered he had helped to pull down the statue. The commander got his men to take a picture of him with al-Yabani. Up to the moment of the toppling of the statue, al-Yabani's relationship with Saddam's family was long and intimate. Less with Saddam himself, to be precise, than with the deposed president's late son, Uday, the violent, sadistic murderer, who first achieved infamy in 1988 for beating his father's food-taster to death. As a world-class wrestler and weightlifter, al-Yabani endured the wrath and whims of Uday's leadership of Iraqi sports. Every time the team did badly, they would return to have their heads and eyebrows shaved on Uday's orders. On at least one occasion, they were put in prison. As a champion bodybuilder, al-Yabani became Uday's personal trainer. He helped to design a gym for him - \"the best gym in the Middle East,\" says al-Yabani, worth a million dollars. With doctors, he drew up a course of weights and diet supplements for Uday, to build up his arms, shoulders and chest. According to al-Yabani, Uday spent a quarter of a million dollars on muscle-building pills, which, he claims, included anabolic steroids. \"Steroids affected him,\" says al-Yabani. \"He became an addict. The doctors said he should not mix alcohol and steroids, but he did and it drove him mad. He was trying to be a hero by taking more and more tablets. But he failed.\" The two men had a shared passion for powerful motorbikes. Uday had a big collection, and al-Yabani used to service them. After the most serious of a sequence of assassination attempts on Uday, in 1996, the murderous playboy was no longer able to ride a regular motorcycle, and al-Yabani's workshop converted some of his prized two-wheelers into high-powered tricycles. Al-Yabani already had cause to hate the Hussein family. Ten members of his aunt's family died in the failed anti-Saddam uprising of 1991, a cousin was executed in 1993, and his brother, a communist, had to flee the country to the Netherlands in the 1980s. His most intimate grievance, however, concerned motorbikes. Evading US sanctions, he imported two Harley Davidsons from Beirut, paying $12,000 for them. When Uday heard about the rare machines, he became jealous, and sent his people around. Al-Yabani was forced to sell the bikes to Uday for $5,000. In retaliation, al-Yabani stopped repairing Uday's collection. To Uday, this was disrespect, and could not be tolerated. Before long, al-Yabani found himself before a judge, on what he claims was a trumped-up charge of stealing an engine. He got nine years. Because of an amnesty and his good behaviour, he was released in 1998, after only two years, but he never forgave the Saddam regime. In his garage, a year after the toppling of the statue, al-Yabani replays his moment of fame in a way that might appear vain in a more worldly man, but in him seems innocent. According to his version of events, he orchestrated the whole operation; even the spanking of the toppled statue by Iraqis with their shoes was directed by him, he declares. He is happy. He loves the Americans; he loves their motorbikes; he doesn't want them to leave yet. \"The Americans did us a great favour,\" he says. \"With them we got rid of Saddam, his party and his criminals. For that, we can put up with anything.\" In the wake of Saddam's fall, al-Yabani's garage filled up with trophies. All Uday's monster three-wheeled invalid motorcycles are there, and the Harleys, and, in pride of place, a 1957 British Norton motorcycle that Saddam Hussein the revolutionary rode when on the run after the assassination of Abd al Karim Qasim half a century ago. It is in perfect condition. Al-Yabani starts it for me: it growls into life. He is a bit unclear as to how these motorcycles came here, and what is going to happen to them. Saddam's motorbike actually belongs in the notoriously looted national museum. At our first meeting, al-Yabani tells me he bought it from looters for $700, and is just keeping it safe. The second time we see him, he doesn't mention the looters. The other bikes, he says, always belonged to him - Uday just had them on loan. I had arranged to see al-Yabani a third time, but when I arrive at his garage, he isn't there. He has gone to a funeral in Hilla, I am told. One of his associates asks if I know how much a 1957 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud, formerly the property of the Emir of Kuwait, is worth. Oh, of course, they are planning to give it back to the emir. Still, it would be interesting to know how much it is worth. There was no funeral. It transpired later that al-Yabani had been arrested on suspicion of possessing and attempting to fence looted motorbikes. They came for him in large numbers; the Iraqi police, backed up by a small convoy of flak-jacketed, helmeted, tooled-up American soldiers in Humvees. They took him away to prison, where he sits, awaiting judicial process. At one point during the raid, the Iraqi police used a heavy sledgehammer to try to break open one of his lock-ups. \"There is an absence of security, but we are really comfortable right now, because we got rid of this dictatorial terrorist family,\" said al-Yabani the last time I saw him. \"We've got some problems, like the electricity, but we're really pleased we got rid of Saddam and his sons, thank God.\" JM Read part two here"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
