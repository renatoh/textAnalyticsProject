Gavin Brown, the Eagles' stand-off, produced a performance of great authority, creating four of their six tries and kicking six goals to make the man-of-the-match award a formality. With the score 8-8 after 28 minutes, Doncaster were very much in the game but they declined alarmingly in the second half as the Eagles moved the ball with greater pace and conviction, punching great holes in the visitors' defence. It was not so much a black day for the Dragons' defence as a Brown one, with Gavin Brown's excellence backed up by two tries from the winger Ian Brown and another touchdown from Craig Brown. The stand-off's high kick caused panic in the Doncaster defence and led to the Eagles' opening try by Gareth Dobson, only for Doncaster to come back into the game when Richard Baker outpaced the Eagles' cover for a 50-metre score. Gavin Brown's penalty on 24 minutes was answered by a second Dragons try when Paddy Handley went in at the corner. That, though, was as good as it got for Doncaster. Andrew Brent's fine try eight minutes from half-time was converted by Gavin Brown and the second half belonged almost entirely to the Eagles. Dobson and Billy Kershaw made the running for the first of Ian Brown's tries in the 44th minute as the Doncaster defence was again found wanting. Things got worse for the visitors when Gavin Brown's kick to the corner was completely missed by John Woodcock and Gareth Hewitt pounced for an easy try. Doncaster's stand-off Paul Mansson then saw his kick bounce off Eagles' full-back Andy Poynter's shoulder for Martin Moana to collect Doncaster's third try, with Jason Lee's kick taking the score to 24-14. But the try had been against the run of play and Sheffield punished the Dragons with further scores from Craig and Ian Brown.
