The films and programs that rank among our best are, predominately, ones that tell Australian stories with Australian voices. This is no accident. Thirty years ago Australian performers convinced the federal government that taxpayer-funded film and television should do exactly that, tell our stories with our voices. The government responded by producing guidelines to regulate the use of foreign talent in Australian film and television. These guidelines were designed to ensure local industry was given \u201ca fair chance\u201d to be employed in film and television productions and Australian voices were heard. These guidelines have stood, with some modifications, for more than two decades. They have ensured Aussie actors and crew have access to significant jobs. They have worked hand in hand with other funding rules to build our pool of talent and to ensure taxpayer dollars are invested in culturally relevant content. Now the Abbott government, as part of its deregulation agenda, is proposing drastic changes to the guidelines that determine the degree of foreign participation in key creative elements of our industry. And by drastic changes, I mean they propose that they are totally scrapped. In May, actors and screen technicians attended meetings across the country as part of the Save Our Stories campaign and to reaffirm their commitment to the cultural objectives embodied in law all those years ago. At the Melbourne meeting I attended, established performers, many of who had fought so hard to secure the original agreement, expressed their incredulity that we might return to square one. They sat beside drama school graduates and other new industry members who were understandably fearful for what these changes could mean for their future career success. Since those meetings, thousands more have joined the campaign online. We are dumbfounded by the government\u2019s proposal because it doesn\u2019t just shift the goal posts, it rips them out of the ground. It is widely held in the film industry that stars sell movies and make the raising of finance easier. Considering the relatively small size of the industry, an impressive number of Australian actors and highly skilled technical screen professionals have achieved international recognition. Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Hugh Jackman, Sam Worthington, Heath Ledger, Jack Thompson, Nicole Kidman, Rose Byrne, Jacki Weaver, Guy Pearce, Judy Davis, Mel Gibson, and many more were able to launch international careers after demonstrating their considerable talent in Australian film and television productions. Add to this list directors, like George Miller, Phillip Noyce and Baz Luhrmann, and technical crew who have achieved international recognition and careers after making their first films in Australia. These Aussie success stories can, and do, bring their \u201cstar\u201d power back to Australia and Australian productions, which in turn strengthens and develops our local industry. Similarly many of my acting colleagues are attempting to forge successful careers overseas, principally in the US. Like most film-making nations, the US has very stringent employment restrictions on the use of foreign artists. To work there, Australian actors must demonstrate they are performers of \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d, and to do this they need to have substantial film and television credits. The rules that ensure Australians have access to a fair share of principal work opportunities in local film and TV contribute to obtaining these credits. As their stars continue to rise internationally, they too can feed their box office potential back to our homegrown products. The current guidelines don\u2019t prevent big names from coming here. Australian performers relish the opportunity to work with our international colleagues. Our industry is global and established performers and screen technicians enjoy the prospect of working around the world. The opportunity to work alongside an acknowledged overseas star can be an amazing learning experience. As a young actor, I was professionally enriched by working with well-known actors like Jimmy Smits, Warren Mitchell, Honor Blackman and Tim Brooke-Taylor. This is not a parochial campaign. We know that there are significant benefits to opening our industry to the world. Many of our most successful Aussie movies have input from foreign talent. The issue at stake is finding and maintaining the appropriate balance between foreign and local influences in the telling of our stories. Obviously not all sectors of the production industry agree that the existing system is the perfect model for regulating Australian film and television. Times change, modifications and refinements to policy and regulation may be necessary in this rapidly changing industry. So it is important that the whole industry sits down with government to discuss ways to improve funding and certification models. In fact, we are all duty bound to do it because we are spending taxpayers\u2019 money. So let\u2019s discuss what can be improved, but let\u2019s make it a fair negotiation, rather than tearing up rules that have assisted the development of a rich and diverse industry with fair opportunities for all creative participants.
