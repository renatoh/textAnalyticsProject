Lord Kalms, one of the Conservatives' biggest donors, had said he would consider backing the party but made clear yesterday that Ukip was \"a bit of a red herring\". He said: \"I'm not going to give them money.\" He added that he was confident the Tories would pursue a more radical Eurosceptic stance in the run-up to the next election. His remarks came as Nigel Farage, Ukip's leader, pledged to fight the Electoral Commission in court and accused it of attempting to put Ukip out of business to \"justify [its] existence\". Alan Bown, the party's biggest donor, has lived, worked and paid tax in the UK all his life but was not on the electoral roll when he gave the money, although he was registered before December 2004 and from January 2006. Ukip says he did not even realise he had been removed and that he was angry that the \u00a3367,697 would go to the Treasury instead of being returned to him. The problem appears to have come to light because of routine checks by the commission, which said that it vets all new and some existing donors, including all those who give more than \u00a350,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
