Would he like the job? No. Had he been asked? No. Were he to be asked would he change his mind? No. Was there any way he could be tempted? No. \"My job is at Quins, full stop,\" said O'Shea, currently 20-1 to replace Martin Johnson after Harlequins had virtually kicked Gloucester out of the Heineken Cup. \"Players like Chris Robshaw and George Robson have committed to 2015, and I want to commit to them.\" You can understand why. After 12 games this season, Harlequins are unbeaten and should they beat lowly Newcastle in the league next Sunday they will equal their own record start set 15 years ago. Then before Christmas comes the mouth-watering double-header with Toulouse which will decide whether O'Shea's side get into the knockout stages of Europe ahead of the four-times champions. \"We feel we are at the start of a journey, not even midway through it,\" said O'Shea, who not so long ago was running the RFU's academy system. \"I will get a huge amount of pleasure if we are successful and we see a lot of guys go on to represent England, [but] I want to be at Harlequins, and I am going to be at Harlequins.\" All of which is a shame for England because Harlequins are playing with a discernable pattern and style that was never so obvious under Johnson and is winning admirers from the most unlikely areas. \"Stuffed,\" said a former Gloucester coach after Saturday's defeat which means their back-to-back games against Connacht will count for little without other sides tripping up. For Harlequins under O'Shea it was further evidence that they have become a ruthlessly efficient side and that the start to their season is no fluke or based upon other sides having more key players away at the World Cup. Until last month Gloucester had gone two league seasons without losing at Kingsholm and the importance of Saturday's win was not lost on O'Shea. \"This is one of the hardest places to come and get a result,\" said O'Shea after his side had silenced the Shed long before the final whistle. After a one-sided first half when they rarely got their hands on the ball and had their Samoan flanker Maurie Fa'asavalu sin-binned for something most Samoans would consider a cuddle rather than a dangerous tackle, Harlequins still led by tries from Mike Brown and new boy Matt Hopper to a couple of Gloucester penalties. And after an even more lopsided second session, their defensive superiority was rubbed in when Nick Easter galloped home untouched from 25 yards. \"We looked threatening when we had the ball, and we took our chances. We were clinical. We were magnificent in defence,\" said O'Shea without a hint of exaggeration. \"There is an energy among the players, and we have a hell of a lot of heart. Everyone gave everything out there.\" Gloucester May; Sharples, Trinder, Tindall, Vainikolo (Voyce, h-t); Burns (Taylor, 62), R Lawson (Lewis, 56); Wood (Christolini, 70), S Lawson (Dawiduik, 60), Harden (Murphy, 70), James (Savage, 59), Hamilton, Buxton [capt, Narraway, 70], Qera, Strokosch.
