He watched helplessly as his side let Peterborough out of jail. The Quakers were less than 10 minutes from a \u00a3400,000 historic first ever meeting at home to neighbours Newcastle when Peterborough's Jimmy Bullard equalised from the spot following David Brightwell's foul on Leon McKenzie. Darlington sprinted into a two-goal advantage by the hour, set on their way by a stunning angled drive from Neil Wainwright just before the interval. When Barry Conlon lobbed home from 12 yards, his side's passage into the last 32 seemed clear. It meant Conlon made amends after putting a penalty into orbit just before half-time as Mark Tyler had been adjudged to have moved too soon in brilliantly saving Brian Atkinson's original effort. \"I'm still asking myself how we've not won that,\" reflected Darlington manager Tommy Taylor. \"As soon as we went two up we sat back and allowed ourselves to be turned. We've let ourselves down big time.\" His opposite number Barry Fry added: \"I'm absolutely delighted to be still in the cup. For a long time it looked to be going their way.\" Midfielder David Farrell sparked the come-back on 66 minutes with a neat close-range finish. If the replay has half as much excitement, London Road will be an interesting place to be next Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
