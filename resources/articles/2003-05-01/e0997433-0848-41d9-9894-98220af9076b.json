A 66-1 chance beat a hot favourite on Tuesday, while Kris Kin, the 20-1 outsider of four, was the winner of the Dee Stakes yesterday, so it was a relief for thousands of punters on the final day of the meeting to see Darryll Holland ride a perfect race on Asian Heights, evens favourite for the Group Three Ormonde Stakes. Asian Heights has a well-known tendency to dwell in the stalls, one fact alone that hardly marks him out as a likely Chester type. Yesterday, though, Holland managed to get him away with uncommon speed, and he sat in third as Compton Bolter cut out the running. When the leader kicked on with three furlongs to run, most of the field was quickly struggling, but Holland was ideally placed to launch his challenge with no fading runners to get in his way. He stayed on well through the last of the extended thirteen furlongs to win by a length and a quarter. This was the fifth success of Asian Heights' eight-race career, and perhaps the third time that Geoff Wragg's five-year-old has looked ready to tackle the best opposition around. He was among the favourites for the 2001 Derby before an injury ended his Classic season just days before the race, while two good runs last year saw him sent to Longchamp for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, in which he finished 14th of the 16 runners. \"We'll go for the Hardwicke Stakes,\" Wragg said, \"and the owner wants to win the Arc this year. Whether he will have another race in between those two, I don't know. He had a bad draw in the Arc last year and never got into the race. He is much stronger this year, a more solid type of horse who doesn't worry about anything. I told Darryll to get among them and make sure he knew he had been in a race.\" Kris Kin, whose defeat of the 4-9 favourite Big Bad Bob in the Dee Stakes was a painful blow for the punters, may now run in the Derby next month, when success would probably be just as hard for the backers to take. Sir Michael Stoute's runner attracted next to no money yesterday for the simple reason that Keiren Fallon had chosen to ride Big Bad Bob instead. However, the market often over-reacts to decisions of this sort, apparently assuming that the rider had a clear-cut preference when it is just as likely that he faced a 55-45 choice between two promising and lightly raced colts. Lynch brought Kris Kin from last to first in the short straight, and there was no trace of fluke about the result. Luck only got involved a few yards after the post, as Kris Kin jinked right as his jockey waved his whip in celebration and threw him off. Only Lynch's pride suffered, though it could easily have been far worse. \"Kieren rode the other horse because we weren't sure about the ground for this one,\" Bruce Raymond, racing manager to Saeed Suhail, said. \"We were going to take him out but when it cut up to just a couple of runners we put him back in. The owner likes to have runners in the Derby but he will need to be supplemented for \u00a390,000. I don't imagine he will run again before then if he does go to Epsom.\" Kris Kin can be backed at 25-1 for the Epsom Classic with Victor Chandler and Hill's, while Big Bad Bob, who hold an entry for the Derby, is now more likely to contest the Italian equivalent on May 25. A more significant impact on the ante-post Derby betting is likely on Sunday, when Alamshar and Brian Boru, two of the first three names in the lists, go head-to-head in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial at Leopardstown. Seamus Heffernan, who has won the last two runnings of the race on Galileo and High Chaparral, who both went on to win at Epsom, is expected to ride Brian Boru for Aidan O'Brien. Mick Kinane, Ballydoyle's senior rider, is more likely to ride O'Brien's runners at Longchamp the same afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
