This was a second formidable win for West Ham's young professionals in the Premier League's new venture this season \u2013 the Barclays U21 League \u2013 which has replaced the old reserve league as part of English football radical overhauling its youth development. This trumpeted revolution for improving England's home-grown players, the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP), arrives by coincidence after the soul-searching that followed England's underwhelming efforts at this summer's European Championship. Rows over the reduced up-front compensation Premier League clubs will have to pay for lower division clubs' youngsters (payments increase if players progress to the first team) have largely overshadowed discussion of EPPP's principles. Topically, given British athletes' landmark successes at the Olympics, the new system seeks to import for football the science of other sports. At its head is the Premier League's director of youth, Ged Roddy, who has been recruited from the University of Bath, which runs \"podium\" excellence programmes with substantial lottery funding for elite athletes who competed in the Olympics. The Premier League is emphatic that its clubs are committed to upgrading youth development, earmarking \u00a3320m over the next four years to the improved facilities, coaching, education, welfare, intensive monitoring and target-setting regimes which the EPPP requires. The gap between the supreme quality of facilities and experience the few top youngsters will enjoy and the grassroots playing fields whose local-authority budgets are being cut again is eyewatering. A stated aim of EPPP is to increase to 50% the number of Premier League players qualified to play for England, which currently stands at 39%. \"The EPPP will make coaches more accountable for their training; they have to record the evidence, set clear, detailed, regularly reviewed objectives for every young player,\" explains Terry Westley, the Premier League's senior club youth development support manager. \"That happens in other sports. This is a culture shift in football; some coaches are complaining about the increased paperwork, but it can only help.\" The programmes have been developed in co-operation with the Football Association, although the FA's director of football, Sir Trevor Brooking, lost his long turf war with the clubs for the FA to lead youth development. Both the EPPP and the new U21 League are Premier League initiatives. The FA's role, based around its training HQ at St George's Park in Burton-on-Trent, is to produce the coaches. \"The EPPP has brought in improvements I am happy to support,\" Brooking says. \"For some time our 16-year-olds have not been good enough, given the size of the country. I am obsessed with the need to improve skills at the foundation stage, 5-11, and youth development stage, 12-16. The void in all our teams, up to the senior national team, is in the attacking third: we need talented individuals at 16 able to become top strikers and No10s.\" The U21 League has been introduced as a competitive stepping stone across the gap between youth football and the rarefied first teams of the Premier League, now staffed by some of the world's top international players. With no commitment from clubs to reduce the number of overseas players they sign, the argument is that the young players themselves must improve, and the U21 League will provide a \"pathway\", and time, for them to do so. Although Everton's match against West Ham was not open to the public \u2013 just to a cluster of middle-aged scouts, lining the length of the pitch \u2013 most games are intended to be, and at least two must be played at a club's main stadium. Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea have already played Under-21 matches at their first-team stadiums and the fixtures are mostly free to enter. So the new league is aimed at giving fans, some of whom are priced out of first-team matches or unable to get tickets, the opportunity to see their clubs' young players in action, and the players experience performing in competitive matches, watched by crowds. Premier League clubs commonly loan young players to League One or Two clubs \u2013 vital, according to Everton's Under-21 coach, Alan Stubbs, for them to learn that \"making a mistake matters \u2013 there are consequences\". Westley describes the U21 League as \"a small step\" to bridge the gulf, its principal merits organisational; the games are staged at the weekends to complement a first-team schedule, and the league is national, not regional, as was the now-scrapped reserve league. Clubs can field an over-21 goalkeeper and three over-age outfield players. \"It is an alternative to sending players out on loan, if the games are played in the main stadium with supporters watching \u2013 the loan system will still be used where it's right for the player,\" says Westley. West Ham's Under-21 team, with the striker Rob Hall, a loan player at Oxford United and MK Dons last season, the winger Blair Turgott and central midfielder George Moncur all outstanding, relished Sunday's game, while Everton struggled for coherence. Afterwards Stubbs praised EPPP's efforts to make coaching more professional, but said he worries about the culture in which young players \u2013 who can earn up to \u00a3150,000 a year even at this level \u2013 are developing. \"It is often difficult to get them to respond to adversity,\" said Stubbs. \"I worry that some players get too much too early and are protected a bit too much.\" John Bowler, the chairman of Crewe Alexandra, one of the most distinguished lower division clubs for developing young players, said he acknowledges EPPP as a step forward, but the mathematics still mean Premier League clubs' academies will have a much higher failure than success rate. Clubs can recruit 30 players in each age group from under nine to under 14, 20 at each of under 15 and under 16, 15 in each year from under 17 to under 21. Yet there are still only 25 in a first-team squad which senior players, many from overseas, can occupy for more than a decade. \"The whole system needs to be properly monitored,\" Bowler argues. \"Will it deliver more better players, and what happens to the young people who do not make the grade? I am concerned about them.\" Westley argues that the education and welfare now being provided by Premier League clubs is vastly superior to youth programmes of the past, and players are given the best opportunities. \"All these things, the coaching and new technical culture, will be the start of improving things,\" he says. Great as the investment is, it all nevertheless sounds uncomfortably similar to the promises made when the 1997 FA Charter for Quality introduced academies, allowing clubs access to very young children. Instead of improving the England team \u2013 the stated founding purpose of the Premier League \u2013 the top clubs narrowed opportunities by buying ready-made stars from abroad. For the gilded youth of Everton and West Ham, displaying their skills in the sunshine, and the English game at large, it remains uncertain whether the EPPP and the U21 League will indeed furnish a better future. david.conn@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
