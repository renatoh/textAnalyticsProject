The shortage was first reported by the Washington Post, which said the supply of respirator masks, gloves and other medical supplies was running low. Trump, who has been criticised for a lack of central planning, confirmed on Wednesday: \u201cIt is, because we\u2019re sending it directly to hospitals. We don\u2019t want it to come to the stockpile because then we have to take it, after it arrives, and bring it to various states and hospitals.\u201d The president had urged states to \u201cmake a deal\u201d and buy personal protective equipment (PPE) directly from manufacturers, he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked states where they have large manufacturers of different types of equipment to use those local factories, those local plants and have it made directly, ship it right into the hospitals.\u201d Trump continued: \u201cWe\u2019re shipping things right in. We have, as you know, almost 10,000 ventilators which we need for flexibility. It\u2019s sounds like a lot but it\u2019s not.\u201d The national guard had been authorised to move equipment into hospitals when necessary, he added. Citing officials at the Department of Homeland Security, the Post reported that the depletion of the national stockpile left the White House and states competing for PPE in a \u201cfreewheeling global marketplace rife with profiteering and price-gouging\u201d. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) had shipped or delivered 11.6m N95 respirators, 26m surgical masks, 5.2m face shields, 4.3m surgical gowns, 22m gloves, and 8,100 ventilators, the White House said on 28 March. But Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, has complained that Fema contributes to a bidding war between states for ventilators, likening the situation to eBay. Other state governors and city mayors have complained of a chronic lack of test kits, masks and ventilators. Wednesday\u2019s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing made an unusual start as Trump was first joined by the attorney general, William Barr; the secretary of defense, Mark Esper; and top military officials, who did not seem concerned with physical distancing. And with America still digesting predictions that up to 240,000 people could die from the pandemic, the president instead focused on \u201cdrug cartels\u201d \u2013 a familiar applause line at his campaign rallies. The president announced the sending of navy ships toward Venezuela as the US intensifies counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific following a drug indictment against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who still controls the country. Trump said: \u201cAs governments and nations focus on the coronavirus, there is a growing threat that cartels, criminals, terrorists and other malign actors will try to exploit the situation for their own gain. We must not let that happen.\u201d Esper added: \u201cThe Venezuelan people continue to suffer tremendously due to Maduro and his criminal control over the country, and drug traffickers are seizing on this lawlessness.\u201d The link to the coronavirus seemed tenuous at best. Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told reporters: \u201cWe came upon some intelligence some time ago that the drug cartels as a result of Covid-19 were going to try to take advantage of the situation and try to infiltrate additional drugs into our country. \u201cAs we know, 70,000 Americans die on an average annual basis to drugs. That\u2019s unacceptable. We\u2019re at war with Covid-19, we\u2019re at war with terrorists, and we are at war with the drug cartels, as well. This is the United States military. You will not penetrate this country. You will not get past Jump Street. You are not going to come in here and kill additional Americans.\u201d The president was asked about reports that China had undercounted its coronavirus cases. He said: \u201cTheir numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side, and I\u2019m being nice when I say that \u2026 As to whether or not their numbers are accurate, I\u2019m not an accountant from China.\u201d Some viewers dismissed the Venezuela announcement as another Trump stunt. Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, tweeted: \u201cTurning this off now. This is just completely ridiculous and dishonest. But it\u2019s what we\u2019ve come to expect from Trump and his Administration.\u201d Eventually the defence officials left the podium and were replaced by Trump\u2019s health experts Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci. The president against defended his preparations for the pandemic and denied he was at fault for a slow start in testing, claiming he \u201cinherited a very broken system\u201d. He praised healthcare workers as \u201cwarriors\u201d. Trump predicted a fast recovery for the economy once the virus had passed and expressed hope that Congress\u2019s next emergency relief bill will including spending on infrastructure. And the president, who had sought on Tuesday to prepare the nation for unfathomable loss of life, nevertheless could not resist some levity. He said of Fauci: \u201cHe was a great basketball player,\u201d and mused: \u201cI have hundreds of millions of people. Number one on Facebook \u2026 Did you know? I just found out.\u201d When a Fox News reporter asked him a tough question, the president snapped: \u201cWhat are you, working for CNN?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
