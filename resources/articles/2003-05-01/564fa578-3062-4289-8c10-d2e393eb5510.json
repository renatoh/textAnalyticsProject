And, more likely than not, he would also be one almighty strop. Why? Because Lennart's afternoon \"training session\" (aka Uefa's traditional 77-course lunch) was today cancelled to allow time to tackle 40 European disciplinary cases - including, since you ask, our very own Football Association, who were indicted for the racist and violent incidents which marred England's 2-0 Euro 2004 win over Turkey. Three hours (and lots of high-fat snacks later) came the verdict: with Uefa handing out their largest ever fine for racism (150,000 Swiss Francs - or \u00a370,000 in old money) to the FA - but stopping short of ordering England to play their next home game against Slovakia in an empty Riverside Stadium. \"It represents the largest ever fine imposed for a racism-related charge,\" Uefa's director of communications Mike Lee confirmed, nibbling a roasted peanut or seven for energy. \"It also sends a very clear signal and a very clear warning to the English FA.\" Indeed it does. Because back in London, the FA's Netscape-crashing website, The-FA.com, was this very afternoon promising to get tough with England yobbos - claiming they would 'name and shame' the thugs who invaded the pitch during Turkey game and ban them for life. \"We have photographs of every individual who infiltrated the field of play that night,\" barked the FA's over-excited spokesman Adrian Bevington, in his best pseudo-spook speak. Still, such talk isn't yet winning over Uefa. \"We think they are taking their responsibilities seriously judging by the statements made in the last few days,\" was Lee's cautious assessment. \"But if those steps are not taken then disciplinary issues will be back on the agenda.\" Along with Uefa's famous 77-course lunch, the Fiver suspects. IT DON'T MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD Enjoying a leisurely flick through the Fiver's Bumper Book of Celebrity Dogs [Growler Press, \u00a36.29] this afternoon, it left us in no doubt as to the special bond that exists betwixt man and the barking beast. There, page 11; a soft-focus shot of slobbery Schnorbitz licking old flabby features Bernie Winters! And page 42; a dreamy snap of Bob Carolgees and Spit The Dog. Look hard and you'll notice Bob's got his hand right up... hang on, is that legal? Still, keep flicking, past Well 'Ard and his mutt Robbie [p92], and on past Roy Keane and Triggs [p103], and we come to the latest celebrity dog lover: Paul Robinson, of Leeds United [not Neighbours], who loves dogs so much, he lets them dictate where he plays his football! Coincidentally/tenuously, speculation has continued to mount today that Robinson will be the next man through the Leeds United plc exit this summer. So much so that the shot-saving soap double has had to throw cold water on the rumour-mongers and then set his snarling hounds on the poor hacks. \"I've got no plans to move anywhere,\" he told Leeds, Leeds, Leeds, which is the club magazine rather than another shoddy typo on our part. \"I've just bought a new house in Yorkshire. I've got a bit of land and my dogs, two boxers, run around on it.\" So what of those rumours of a juicy move to Arsenal? \"My dogs love running around, I'm not going to put two boxers in a city centre apartment with no garden,\" he protested, perhaps a little too much for the Fiver's liking. All of which would ordinarily be enough to get the hacks off his back. But for the fact that he recently viewed several over-priced pads in the Smoke, without a second's thought for his precious hounds. \"I've got a pension,\" he cried, for no apparent reason, and clearly flustered. \"I just fancied an investment property, an apartment in the centre of London. It's somewhere to invest my money and if I get a weekend off it's nice to use.\" Ah, how foolish of us to have grasped the wrong end of the stick so firmly. \"I think that someone - maybe one of the estate agents - stitched me up,\" grinned Robbo, finding it easy to laugh about it now. \"It's the thing about Leeds having had to sell some of their players recently. Someone put two and two together and made 46.\" How foolish, eh. Eh? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"When I spoke to them they said they were looking for someone young and English and there are not many of us at [Chelsea's of] Chelsea!\" - John Terry explains the criteria on which the PFA (an equal opportunities employer) decided to ask him to be his club's new union rep. NOW IS A TIME FOR CIGARETTES AND BOOZE - REPRISE Klaus Topploader is a man of many talents. He can take a small German factory side to the final of Big Cup. He can sing Dancing in the Moonlight and make it sound as though a privet hedge is being extricated from his backside (just like Joe Washbourn, in fact). And he can pull off a convincing impression of Daily Mail football reporter Jeff \"we've sold our birthright down the fjord to a nation of seven million skiers and hammer throwers who spend half their lives in darkness\" Powell. But unlike Jeff, Klaus is not afraid of people from other countries, which is just as well, because he might be in charge of a small English factory side next season. Fayed's formerly of Fulham are looking for a new man to manage their flagship store, just as soon as they have decided where to open it. Since getting the sack from Neverkusen in February, the Fiver's man of the year (it's all in the timing) has been laying low with his good friends John Player and Jack Daniels. But, unlike Joe Washbourne, Toppi is all set to make a comeback. \"I haven't met [Fayed's formerly of] Fulham but I hope to meet them next week OOH YA!\" shrieked Klaus, his flammable breath setting light to his Indie flop mop as he sparked up his 647,384th tab of the day. \"It's OUCH right that I OOH! OOH! contacted them six or AAHhhh! seven weeks ago,\" he choked, managing to put out his fright wig using nothing but his telephone. It's this type of calmness in a crisis and ability to make good use of whatever is available, however unsuitable, that might see Topploader appointed ahead of other candidates Louis van Cheesehead, George Burley and Paul Hart. \"Fulham are a very good club and it would be very interesting to coach a team in England,\" the choker continued. \"I can build a team - it doesn't matter which club I work at,\" he added. With a proven track record of promising everything and actually producing very little, he's a Fulham man through and through. THE RUMOUR MILL For reasons known only to themselves, Valencia think swapping the best part of \u00a310m for Joe Cole represents good business. The West Hammer attended their Big Cup victory over Arsenal at the Mestalla last month and was given a nice tour of the stadium by club officials. Commitment, eh? Manchester United are chasing - though clearly not very hard - mid-paced Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard. \"United have had scouts looking at him at almost every match. They are keen,\" claimed a man in a fake beard and overcoat today. \"But Frank is happy at Stamford Bridge.\" And adding four-star fuel to the soporific Becks-To-Real saga, Racing Avellaneda midfielder Mariano Gonzalez has issued a \"come-and-get-me\" plea to Manchester United. \"I spoke to Juan Veron on the phone and he told me great things about United,\" said the 21-year-old. NEWS IN BRIEF Everton's Duncan Ferguson will face trial by TV after pictures appeared to show him elbowing Aston Villa's Joey Gudjonsson in last Saturday's Premier League match at Goodison Park. Despite myopic whistle-blower Graham Poll missing the incident, the FA has told Everton that their video panel will assess the evidence. Gary Neville's left foot is screwed - literally. The Manchester United defender is having surgery today to remove a screw originally inserted into his foot during an operation last summer and will be out for between two and three months. Blackburn striker Hakan Sukur has revealed he has \"problems\" with boss Graeme Souness which could hasten his departure from Ewood Park. Sukur told the Turkish press: \"I have problems with Souness. We had a problem after the Manchester United match and I will discuss it with him.\" An offer from Fenerbahce is on the table. And Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit will almost certainly miss the Confederations Cup in France next month through injury. Petit has a groin strain while Vieira is expected to miss the rest of the season because of a lingering knee problem. TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Channel 4: Brazilian Football (2.10am) The 16,000-mile round trip between sunny Oz and Blighty is long enough, without a bunch of precious, over-paid, whinging footballers conspiring to ruin your day/night/life. How far, we asked yesterday, have you travelled to be humiliated in the name of football? Five: Jonathan Pearce's Football Night (11.55pm) \"I'm not exactly sure when this happened,\" begins Alistair Mitchell, having erased the finer details from his memory, \"but a good friend of mine - who shall remain nameless - made the trip from Auckland, New Zealand to South London just to follow Millwall for the last couple of months of the season. Dutch Football (12.35am) \"During that time, he never saw them win a single game, and I don't think he saw too many goals either. They were relegated that season, which probably qualifies it as a fruitless journey.\" Argentinian Football (2.05am) More recently, in November 2000, Paul Hampson was holidaying in New Zealand with his girlfriend. He had his beady eye on Blighty, however. \"I'd ensured we arrived back at Heathrow at 6am on the morning of the Liverpool v Ipswich match,\" he recalls with glee. Major League Soccer (that's football in normal speak) (3.40am) \"Following a 30-hour trip from the other side of the world, we finally touched down in time to drive up to Anfield to watch the game and, I thought, a shoo-in for the mighty Reds. Sky Sports 1: Football League Review (6.30pm &amp; 2.45am) \"Suffice to say, Marcus Stewart scored the only goal of the game in front of the Kop and ruined it all.\" Still, it wasn't a wasted journey, what with Paul Hampson's girlfriend being an Ipswich fan. Live Conference Football - Doncaster Rovers v Chester City (7.30pm &amp; 12.45am) \"I'm an ex-pat in Perth, Western Australia,\" writes Andrew Sparrow, an ex-pat from, oh, right. \"This season alone I've flown home to the UK to watch Sheffield United strut their stuff in three times.\" Hmm, Glory fan. You're On Sky Sports (10.15pm &amp; 3.45am) \"It's about nine-and-a-half-thousand miles, and I was poised to do it again for the Worthington and then the FA Cup final, but ... well, you know the rest.\" Spanish Football League Review (11.15pm) Highly impressive in the air miles sense, but having not yet seen the Blades lose a game, Mr Sparrow's entry has been shredded. We crave despondency, readers, not lucky omens. Take Garry Noakes' friend, if you will. Eurosport: Euro 2004 highlights (6pm) \"He is planning to drag his wife and two children from their home in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, - home of ... well, Brazil - to watch the Scottish Cup Final,\" he writes, a look of sheer incredulity crossing his email. Copa Libertadores (10.15pm) \"And while there's no guarantee that it will be a fruitless foray, the fact that he supports Dundee and they're playing Rangers suggests he'll be heading back with a long face.\" Radio 5 Live: Sport on 5 with Ian Payne (7pm) But wait! A man called True Skyblue [not his real name, we're guessing] wants to move the goal posts slightly. \"Surely it's not how far you travel but how pointless the game turned out to be,\" he reasons, and not without reason. TalkSport: Football First (7pm) \"I lived in the shadow of Maine Road, about 100 yards away, last season and went, on the coldest of winter evenings and in freezing fog, to see a 'mouth-watering' top-of-the-table clash between Man City and Wolves. Newstalk 106: Off the Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) \"Not only was it the worst match I'd ever seen - City won 1-0 and were still booed off, I'm actually a Coventry City fan, and I almost got frostbite for watching someone else's team. Why?\" Why indeed. Can you compete, readers? Then email the.boss@theguardian.com and get things off your chest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
