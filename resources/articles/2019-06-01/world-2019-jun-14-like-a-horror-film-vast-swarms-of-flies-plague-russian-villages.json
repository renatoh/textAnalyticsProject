Another local was shown sweeping up piles of dead and dying flies from the floor of his home. \u201cEvery day or two there\u2019s enough to fill a bucket, half a bucket,\u201d he said. Residents described scenes as \u201clike something from a horror film\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s unbearable, the flies are everywhere,\u201d said a woman holding a wailing child in her arms. \u201cI\u2019m afraid for my children. We need to poison the flies constantly [with chemicals], but then we all have to breath that air. It\u2019s frightening.\u201d State TV also said the flies could infect people with diseases. Reports said the invasion began after a farmer illegally used tonnes of chicken droppings from a local poultry farm as fertiliser, in which flies laid millions of eggs. Some reports said dead chickens and chicken entrails had also been used. Investigators confirmed they had opened a criminal investigation into the unsanctioned use of \u201cenvironmentally hazardous waste\u201d. Maxim Maksimov, the head of the poultry farm, admitted supplying chicken droppings to the farm for use as fertiliser, but said it was normal practice. \u201cThis is much better than chemicals,\u201d he told the Ura.ru news website. \u201cWe were just unlucky with the weather. A wet spring and then a sudden increase in temperatures created favourable conditions for flies to breed.\u201d He said that he had ordered his workers to cover the farmer\u2019s fields in a bid to prevent flies laying more eggs in the droppings. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work, we are prepared to use special agrochemicals on the villages.\u201d The farmer, Andrei Savchenko, denied he was to blame. \u201cFlies have existed for millions of years, and they are everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just a question of the amount of them. But no one can tell me what the acceptable or cut-off number of flies is.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
