New boss Bill Hilary's main goal is to create landmark drama and comedy to take on the likes of HBO, which has churned out critical hits such as Six Feet Under and The Sopranos and the likes of ABC which has just won two Golden Globes for Desperate Housewives. \"BBC America is a fantastic brand with fantastic shows and tremendous critical buzz. What I intend to do is to take the channel to the next level by turning it into a creative force in the US and a great business,\" he said. The channel has been running on cable TV networks for almost seven years and last year created controversy with its viewers after dumping EastEnders from its schedules. But otherwise the channel is highly regarded and last year won a Golden Globe for The Office as best comedy with writer and star Ricky Gervais picking up a second one for best comedy actor. It has also carved out a reputation for screening the best of British comedy with Cold Feet and other non-BBC series being showcased on the network which is taken in 41.5m homes. \"This investment will enable us to buy more comedy and drama, freshen the schedule and create BBC America programme brands,\" said Mr Hilary, adding that he would be upping the number of co-productions stateside. Born in Belfast, Mr Hilary, was once head of entertainment at Channel 4, responsible for programmes such as Big Breakfast and joined BBC America from Comedy Central in New York. He parted company with Comedy Central after a change of management. At the same time Mr Hilary announced today that he has hired Kathryn Mitchell, a former Comedy Central programming boss as general manager. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
