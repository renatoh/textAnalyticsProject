For half the year the ruins of ancient Mycenae and Minoan palaces compete for attention and revenue from a highly developed tourist industry. Most of the competition is provided by the altogether different requirements of Euro-youth in search of sun, retsina and sin. But for the remaining six months, Greece reverts to a family-oriented way of life which, in rural areas, has remained largely unchanged for centuries. Summer seaside fun is inevitably centred on the scorching sands, blue seas and cooling breezes of its islands. These are divided into six groups: the Cyclades, the Dodecanese (including Rhodes), the North East Aegean (nearest to Turkey in the east), the Ionian (including Corfu) to the west, and the smaller Sporades and Saronic Gulf islands. Crete, to the south of the mainland, is a separate entity and the largest island. About four-fifths of Greece is mountainous - at 2,917m, Mount Olympus is the top peak - and the country has some excellent, and still undiscovered, walking. When it comes to dining out, tavernas are the most typical Greek eateries, and many rent out cheap rooms, too.
