It was late summer 1994 and we were standing on Collaroy beach in Sydney\u2019s north. Bishop, a senator since 1987, was giving an impromptu press conference following the official launch of her campaign for the lower house. Liberal opposition leader John Hewson had 11 months earlier lost the \u201cunloseable\u201d federal election to Paul Keating. Bishop was now launching her bid for the summer playground federal seat of Mackellar, while also angling for John Hewson\u2019s job. I was angling for Bronwyn Bishop. \u201cBronwyn, have you decided yet whether you\u2019re going to cooperate on [my biography] project?\u201d I asked her after the press conference ended. \u201cI\u2019ve told you \u2018no\u2019,\u201d she said, as we both walked towards the sea. \u201cYou actually haven\u2019t told me \u2026 \u201d I began. \u201cI have told you \u2018no\u2019 a number of times,\u201d she snapped again. \u201cNo, you haven\u2019t ever personally told \u2026 \u201d \u201cWell, stand still.\u201d (So I stood still.) \u201cLook at me.\u201d (So I looked at her.) \u201cNO,\u201d she yelled, and with her smile now a ruin on her face, she stormed down the beach in her stilettos. Even then, Bronwyn Bishop didn\u2019t appreciate the kind of scrutiny she liked to apply to others. Two weeks after our coastal clash Bishop suffered a 4.36% swing (on primary votes) against her in the safe Liberal seat, thanks mainly to the exhaustive \u2013 and highly colourful \u2013 campaign run by the Independent candidate and local writer, Bob Ellis. It was a disastrous result for Bishop, and in stark contrast to the outcome in the adjacent Warringah electorate where a virtual political unknown, Tony Abbott, had achieved a 5.2% swing (on a two-party-preferred basis) to him. As Peter Reith said at the time: \u201cBronwyn\u2019s been running on her popularity \u2026 and on Saturday she broke one of her legs, if not both.\u201d For the past 21 years \u2013 and indeed during her entire political career \u2013 commentators have been writing Bronwyn Bishop\u2019s political obituary. Today, with the furore surrounding her $5,000-plus helicopter ride from Melbourne to Geelong, it is tempting to do so once again. A note of caution. For all the ridicule Bishop has often attracted, for all the outrage she has provoked \u2013 particularly as the most partisan Speaker of the House in living memory \u2013 Bishop\u2019s determination, ambition, vanity and imperviousness to criticism should not be ignored. Bronwyn Bishop (nee Setright) became a household name in Australia in 1992 when she turned the rather prosaic-sounding Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit into a show trial, scolding, taunting and badgering \u2013 among others \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s most respected public servants, the then commissioner of taxation, Trevor Boucher. Bishop was suddenly propelled on to the national stage \u2013 exactly the place she had been coveting since 1955, when, at the age of 13, she had declared to a group of school friends that she was \u201cdefinitely going to be the first Australian woman prime minister\u201d. \u201cWe all fell about,\u201d one of those friends told me years later. \u201cWe thought, \u2018That\u2019s just Bronwyn, there she goes again.\u2019\u201d And that was Bronwyn. Between 1974 and 1987 this daughter of an engineer father and dramatic soprano mother made seven separate attempts to win a seat in either state or federal parliament. On her seventh challenge she got there, the first Liberal woman from New South Wales to be elected to the Senate. She was an ideological warrior from the organisational wing of the NSW Liberal party, and her years as president of the party \u2013 between 1985 and 1987 \u2013 were marked by some of the worst infighting and personal feuding the party had ever witnessed. She was accused of relying on the support of the so-called \u201cUglies\u201d (ultra-rightwingers within the party) to become president, which she denied and described as \u201cslur and innuendo\u201d. She was accused by the then state director, Dr Graeme Starr, of breaching party convention by using the presidency to further her political ambitions. She was accused by the then operations manager, Peter Kidman, of changing the culture of the party with respect to how it raised money and then, a few years later, of contravening the party\u2019s fundraising guidelines for her Senate re-election. The other damning assessment of her \u2013 and this from many of her own colleagues \u2013 was that she possessed a genius for getting people offside, for being alarmingly short on policy substance while being driven by personal ambition. After being dumped from John Hewson\u2019s shadow ministry in 1990 she poured her considerable energy into becoming \u2013 as Sydney Morning Herald columnist Alan Ramsey said at the time \u2013 \u201cthe Arnold Schwarzenegger of the estimates committee system\u201d. Everything from government waste and public service indolence came under her pitiless interrogation. In September 1991 she savaged a parliamentary library project officer on her upcoming trip to China which was being paid for by both the library and the Chinese government. One senior Liberal party staffer told me that \u201cit was one of the most obscene displays [they had] ever seen\u201d. That same week Bishop was forced to release details of her own travel costs, which \u2013 for a backbencher \u2013 were simply staggering: $93,456 spent on airfares and car hire from July 1992 to June 1993. And that was before allegations from ex-staffer Ellis Glover were made to this writer that shortly after entering the Senate in 1987 she had hired a helicopter \u2013 at tax payer\u2019s expense \u2013 to get from a fete to a dog show, so as not to be late for the opening.
