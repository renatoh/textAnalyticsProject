Lawes suffered a calf strain in England\u2019s 21-13 defeat by Wales on Saturday and is expected to be sidelined for at least four weeks. Lawes was among England\u2019s most impressive performers on Saturday but hobbled off in the closing stages as Wales came from 10-3 down at half-time to clinch a record 12th victory. Eddie Jones is hopeful Lawes\u2019s absence will be tempered by Maro Itoje\u2019s potential return to fitness with England still to face Italy and Scotland in the championship. Victory in both could still lead to England winning the title if Wales slip up in their final two matches. \u201c[Maro] is coming along well,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe might be a chance [against Italy]. I might have to give him the hurry-up, because we\u2019ve potentially lost Courtney.\u201d Meanwhile England\u2019s players have admitted they failed to deal with Wales\u2019s wind-up tactics as their Six Nations grand slam hopes came to an end \u2013 but rejected Warren Gatland\u2019s stinging criticism that they are big-match chokers. Gatland claimed after his side\u2019s 21-13 win that the ploy to target Kyle Sinckler had paid off after the England tighthead prop was withdrawn before the hour, having given away two penalties in quick succession and been lectured by the referee, Jaco Peyper. Sinckler \u2013 described by Gatland as an emotional timebomb \u2013 excelled for the first 50 minutes but was drawn into an ongoing tussle with Alun Wyn Jones while the man of the match, Liam Williams, also clashed with Manu Tuilagi as Wales increasingly looked able to get under England\u2019s skin. \u201cThe biggest thing was them trying to take our mind off the game,\u201d the England No 8, Billy Vunipola, said. \u201cYou saw in the second half there was a lot more niggle and we bought into that because we thought we had a seven\u2011point buffer. That\u2019s where they grew and every time the game started to speed up one of their players would go down. They wanted us to play at their tempo and they did that really well. The disappointing thing for us is that we didn\u2019t fire a shot in the second half.\u201d Wales gave away three penalties but as the home team fought back from 10-3 down at half-time England\u2019s discipline got progressively worse, and they conceded six in the second half. Jamie George acknowledged Wales were more streetwise but denied Gatland\u2019s claim that \u201cwhen it\u2019s really mattered, I\u2019ve questioned whether they can win these big games\u201d. Jones refused to comment on Gatland\u2019s barb but George said: \u201cI think that\u2019s unfair. Warren can say what he likes. He is in a position of power after winning that game, so fair play to them. We have won big games before and we are going to win big games again. \u201cThey scrapped. You have got to give them respect and the credit they deserve. They certainly kept the pressure on and capitalised on field position we gave them through a lack of discipline.\u201d England have dropped to second in the Six Nations table but are two points behind Wales by virtue of bonus points against Ireland and France. Victories over Italy and Scotland would be enough to claim the title if Wales slip up. England will begin their preparations for the final block of fixtures by welcoming Georgia to their Oxford base for live training sessions this week. Jones will be without Dylan Hartley, who has knee surgery on Tuesday and will miss the rest of the championship. He is also waiting on the results of a scan on Courtney Lawes\u2019s injured calf while Jonny May went off on Saturday with a head injury. Lawes must be considered a doubt to face Italy, having hobbled off in the closing stages, but Jones is hopeful Maro Itoje will be fit following a knee injury. \u201cHe\u2019s coming along well,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe might be a chance [against Italy]. I might have to give him the hurry-up, because we\u2019ve potentially lost Courtney.\u201d Jones also called for Sinckler to be cut some slack after condemnation from supporters. \u201cTrying to single him out and try to make a villain of him will do him a disservice,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good young player and playing in one of the most difficult positions on the field, and he\u2019ll come through as a great Test player for England.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
