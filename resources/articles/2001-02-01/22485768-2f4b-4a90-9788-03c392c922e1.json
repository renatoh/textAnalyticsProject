Mr Sambrook replaces Tony Hall, who leaves the BBC in April to become chief executive of the Royal Opera House. The appointment ends months of speculation about who would get the job, which is one of the BBC's key posts. Alongside Mr Sambrook, the three frontrunners for the post were director of World Service Mark Byford, head of BBC current affairs Mark Damazer and head of television news Roger Mosey. It is thought the BBC never seriously considered an outside candidate, although there were reports the corporation had interviewed the editor of ITN news on ITV, Nigel Dacre. Mr Sambrook said he was \"delighted to have the opportunity to lead BBC News, which is renowned for its authority, impartiality and fairness\". A BBC News \"lifer\" like Tony Hall before him, Mr Sambrook has had a distinguished career at the corporation. As head of newsgathering, the department that co-ordinates the BBC's network of correspondents, Mr Sambrook presided over coverage of the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo and the death of Princess Diana. He worked as a producer and programme editor on the BBC's national TV news programmes and was senior producer and deputy editor of the Nine O'Clock News. Mr Sambrook also covered the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 as a programme producer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
