Mr Kerry has accused George Bush of not defending US economic interests abroad aggressively enough and has said he will review major trade deals that previous administrations signed up to. But Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi, in London to launch the WTO's World Trade Report 2005, said trade was a \"non-partisan issue\". \"People have used this sort of rhetoric during campaigns but then, when they govern, they have to observe the rules their country has signed up to.\" The WTO's 147 member countries thrashed out an 11th-hour deal in Geneva in July, which put the \"Doha round\" of world trade talks back on track. Negotiators pledged to work towards a concrete accord by the end of next year. However, the process is currently on hold because of the US election, which could lead to a new American trade representative replacing Robert Zoellick, while Peter Mandelson replaces Pascal Lamy as European trade commissioner in November. Dr Supachai said he would meet Mr Mandelson soon and impress upon him the need to maintain the impetus that led to the July deal. \"I will make clear to him the need for us to build on the July framework. We need to keep that sense of urgency,\" he said. Dr Supachai did not want to be tied down to the December 2005 deadline that Mr Lamy and others talked of in July. He said: \"It depends on what we do this year, but the key will be the first half of next year.\" Economists have estimated that a final deal could add more than $500bn (\u00a3277bn) a year to the world economy. However, experts say much work remains to be done if the west is to make good on its promise to reduce its lavish farm subsidies and allow poor countries greater access to its markets. Dr Supachai said the WTO's recent rulings against US subsidies to its cotton farmers and European Union sugar subsidies should have no impact on the progress of the trade talks. The World Trade Report said global trade volumes had expanded 4.5% last year. It predicted stronger growth this year on the back of a recovering world economy. It stressed the importance of \"coherence\" in the economic policies of the countries in the Doha round, so that the benefits of freer trade were not diminished by, for example, poor domestic economic policies or bad infrastructure. \"Governments cannot hope to reap the real benefits of open trade if they fail to secure macroeconomic stability, supportive infrastructure, properly functioning domestic markets and sound institutions,\" said Dr Supachai. The report said the WTO would only seek to free up trade where it was clearly in the interests of all countries concerned: \"Cooperation should not be forced upon governments where there is no perception of a common interest.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
