Juan Carlos Arce put the home side ahead with a first-half header and Marcelo Martins added a second eight minutes after the break. Argentina have not missed a World Cup finals since 1970 but are fifth in the South American qualification table. The first four qualify directly. Messi was banned for insulting an assistant referee in Argentina\u2019s qualifier against Chile last week which they won 1-0, thanks to a Messi penalty. The Barcelona forward was also fined 10,000 Swiss francs after approaching the official at the end of the win in Buenos Aires. Barcelona have since described the ban as \u201cunjust and totally disproportionate\u201d, in a statement released on Wednesday. The club said: \u201cFC Barcelona express their surprise and outrage at the official decision of the FIFA disciplinary committee to sanction Leo Messi after the World Cup qualifying match between Argentina and Chile. \u201cThe club consider the four-game ban imposed upon the player unjust and totally disproportionate. \u201cFinally, FC Barcelona want to reiterate their support for Leo Messi, an exemplary sportsman for his behaviour on and off the pitch.\u201d Argentina will be without their captain for three of their final four qualifiers and if Tuesday\u2019s performance is any guide he will be sorely missed. Edgardo Bauza\u2019s side slip down the standings after 14 games after Colombia beat Ecuador 2-0, with James Rodr\u00edguez and Juan Cuadrado goals, and Chile were sent on the way to a 3-1 victory over Venezuela, bottom of the table, with an early Alexis S\u00e1nchez goal. Brazil lead the table from Colombia and Uruguay. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s 25-yard free-kick meant he equalled Marcelo Salas\u2019s national scoring record of 37 goals. He later missed a penalty. Argentina were already without suspended regulars Javier Mascherano, Lucas Biglia and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn in La Paz before Messi\u2019s suspension and they defended poorly throughout the game. \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda was unfortunate not to put away Argentina\u2019s first real chance after 27 minutes but the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder fired his effort just wide before the same man collected Angel Correa\u2019s terrific ball moments later but failed to get past the goalkeeper, Carlos Lampe. Bolivia took the lead when Arce scored a stunning header from Pablo Escobar\u2019s long-range cross. The home side doubled their lead seven minutes after the break as Jorge Flores cut the ball back and picked out Martins, who tapped home from the edge of the six-yard box. Bauza brought on Sergio Ag\u00fcero to add firepower up front four minutes later. Argentina won a free-kick just outside the 18-yard box after 60 minutes but Ever Banega\u2019s effort was cleared by the Bolivian defence, while at the other end Facundo Roncaglia denied Martins his second of the night with a vital block."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
