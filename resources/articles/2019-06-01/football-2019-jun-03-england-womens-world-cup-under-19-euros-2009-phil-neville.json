Jordan Nobbs added a second. \u201cWe were team players,\u201d says Bronze. \u201cWe weren\u2019t individuals. Toni and Jordan both scored in the final but every single player played their part whether they were on the bench or not. That\u2019s kind of similar to this team we\u2019ve got now. We\u2019re not going into this tournament saying: \u2018We need so and so otherwise we\u2019re not going to win.\u2019 We\u2019ve got 23 players that are going to win us a World Cup; the same as it was back then.\u201d Four of the side travelling to France lifted the trophy in Belarus. As well as Bronze and Duggan there is Jade Moore and Demi Stokes, and there would have been more but for injuries to Izzy Christiansen and Nobbs. Gemma Bonner, another member of Mo Marley\u2019s squad 10 years ago, is likely on standby. If there is a feeling that the future of the England men\u2019s team is bright after the successes of the under-17s, under-19s and under-20s two years ago, then in the women\u2019s game there is the feeling the future is now. The 2009 players, who form a steely core in Phil Neville\u2019s 23, are in their prime and have experienced winning a tournament in a England shirt. \u201cI think one of the biggest things we took away from that was actually when you are successful and you win something it\u2019s something you want to go on and do again \u2013 it\u2019s kind of addictive,\u201d says Moore, a Reading midfielder. \u201cThe idea of being that successful again drives the motivation.\u201d Playing with each other through the years has been hugely beneficial. \u201cWe had been together for quite some years and drip-fed players in and out,\u201d says Moore. \u201cBut the core of that group had been together for many, many years. We had a fluidity in the way that we played and we trusted everyone. The togetherness, though, outshone everything else.\u201d Bronze, the Lyon right-back who came up against Barcelona\u2019s Duggan in the recent Champions League final, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that we\u2019ve got that camaraderie,\u201d she says. \u201cWith Toni, in the Champions League final, I\u2019ve known her since we were 16, for over 10 years, and to see her upset? It breaks my heart. You\u2019ve got those relationships because you\u2019ve gone through so much together where we want each other to do well.\u201d Duggan believes it has cultivated respect. \u201cYou go through a lot together; with people\u2019s families, changing clubs, the ups and downs in life, and you really respect people for that. That\u2019s not just the core that went to Belarus. I\u2019ve know Ellen White since we were 13 years old \u2013 I can say the same for probably 80% of this team. That goes a long way on the pitch when you really need to pull together and you\u2019re in tough times.\u201d Bronze attributes her winning mentality to being a part of that generation. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said the younger generation has this crazy winning mentality. Not only did we win that but we made the final the following year, we made the semi\u2011final of a World Cup at under\u201117s \u2026 I think that\u2019s been brought through now. \u201cYou look at maybe not senior international level but senior domestic level, and every single one of those players probably has a trophy now in some way, shape or form and every single one of those players is hunting for trophies. \u201cWe\u2019ve got so many good teams with so many good players and now most of the England players have played in cup finals, they\u2019ve been top of the league, they play in the Champions League. We\u2019ve got that success running through our veins now at England.\u201d Marley, the second woman in England to have been awarded a Uefa Pro Licence (after Hope Powell), is credited with much of the patient nurturing of players through the system. The under-19 manager for 16 years, she stepped into the breach for the senior team on an interim basis after Mark Sampson was fired. Some called for her to get the job full-time, others said she did not want it. Regardless, she has taken charge of the Under-21s since Neville\u2019s appointment and is feeding him players. Marley is known for a holistic approach. She works with players, parents, clubs and coaches to ensure they have the right work\u2011school-life balance. The 2009 team continue to share the memories of that win with her. \u201cWe still speak about it now,\u201d says Duggan. \u201cA couple of years later we were still having a reunion to celebrate it \u2013 we seriously were. Every time we see Mo Marley we mention it to her because we achieved something special together and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll never forget.\u201d Knowing each other inside out means that they never doubt they can win. \u201cWe\u2019ve trained together every single day so we know the potential in the squad,\u201d says Duggan. \u201cWe knew that in Canada. We had a lot of youngsters that could stick together and go a long way together and that\u2019s where you see us now. \u201cWe showed in the Netherlands [at Euro 2017] that it wasn\u2019t a one\u2011off. Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t get over the line \u2013 we got to the semi\u2011finals \u2013 but it\u2019s coming and we know it\u2019s coming, it\u2019s just a case of when.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
