While families tend to head south to the beaches of Devon and Cornwall, and north-west to the magnificence of the Lake District, the beauty and variety of the beaches and moors in the north of England is often overlooked. One of the challenges of a family holiday in this country is how to amuse children when the sun isn't shining. Even though March has been one of the warmest on record, the UK weather is nothing if not unpredictable. So here is our guide to fun days up north that children can enjoy even if the weather isn't perfect. 1. Go birdwatching... at the RSPB reserve at Bempton Cliffs, Flamborough Head, east Yorkshire. From April to mid-July these cliffs are noisy with the calls of breeding and nesting birds. You can see gannet, puffin, guillemot, razorbill, fulmar and kittiwake on the precipitous cliffs. There are cliff-top walks up to one mile (1.6km). The first two viewpoints are at 200 yards and 400 yards and are suitable for wheelchairs and pushchairs. The reserve is open all year, and the visitor centre is open from March to November 10 am to 5 pm, and in winter weekends only 9.30 am to 4 pm. Charges for non-members: \u00a33 car parking fee; \u00a36 for minibus; \u00a38 for coach. \u00b7 More information: www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/bemptoncliffs, 01262 851179 2. Cross the causeway at low tide to... the site of Lindisfarne Priory, Holy Island, Northumberland, one of the most important ancient religious sites in the UK amid the Northumberland coast's spectacular scenery. Check the tide times before you cross - they are displayed at the causeway. Open between 10am and 6pm, the charges are \u00a33 for adults and \u00a31.50 for children. \u00b7 More information: www.lindisfarne.co.uk, 01289 389200 3. Go underground... to explore the caves at the Heights of Abraham, Matlock, Derby. This former spa town is now home to cable cars, caverns and a hilltop park. You can take a guided tour into the caverns where local miners became the millionaires of the day because of the riches they made from extracting lead. The local church convinced them that lead grew underground, and was therefore subject to the 10% tithe levied on all crops and animals in the regions. \u00b7 More information: 01629 582365 4.
