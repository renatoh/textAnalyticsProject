PBS president Paula Kerger said on Monday that airing the show in January was now a \u201choliday tradition\". Critics say this gap between British and American broadcasts of the hit show \u2013 currently about four months \u2013 encourages piracy, as anxious viewers download the show in an attempt to avoid coming across spoilers online. Kerger said viewers are conditioned to watch the show after the Christmas holidays, and used rising audience numbers to support her case. For the 5 January premier of its fourth season, Downton Abbey had 10.2 million US viewers \u2013 an increase from the 7.9 million who watched the season-three premiere. \"It would be very hard for me to imagine putting it anywhere else than where it has seemed to have found a very strong audience,\" Kerger said, though a date for the season-five premiere has not yet been scheduled. PBS has experimented with an earlier release for its other hit British import, Sherlock. The series' third season premiered on Sunday in the US, less than three weeks after its 1 January UK debut. The delayed debut structure will also be used for the network\u2019s less popular British imports, The Bletchley Circle and Call the Midwife, which return in the spring. At the Television Critics Association press tour on Monday, PBS said it had also picked up the British sitcom Vicious, starring Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi as two older gay men, to air in June. It was also announced that Ken Burns is working on a documentary about country music, to air in 2018."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
