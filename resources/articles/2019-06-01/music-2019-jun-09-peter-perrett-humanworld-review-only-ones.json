Almost four decades after the Only Ones\u2019 acrimonious dissolution, finally clean after years of heroin and crack addiction, and backed by his sons Jamie (guitar) and Peter Jr (bass), Perrett showed he still had a way with a drawled melody, even if his ruminations on Kim Kardashian\u2019s bottom seemed a little unnecessary. The follow-up is even better, delivered with a greater confidence and urgency, and featuring a handful of songs that almost match up to his late-70s output. The title of the thrillingly direct War Plan Red might be a reference to a 1930 US military plan to attack British interests in the North Atlantic, but when Perrett sings, \u201cThe stars and stripes and swastikas filled Madison Square Garden\u201d, it seems more like a snapshot from a dystopian near-future. The mid-paced Master of Destruction, written by his son Jamie and containing the album\u2019s most potent chorus, is stronger still. He\u2019s equally adept on the slower material: Heavenly Day showcases his more romantic side, while Believe in Nothing is heroically nihilistic (\u201cBlackest hole is drawing us in/Bleakest future there\u2019s ever been\u201d). Is it too much to hope that there\u2019s more to come from Perrett\u2019s Indian summer?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
