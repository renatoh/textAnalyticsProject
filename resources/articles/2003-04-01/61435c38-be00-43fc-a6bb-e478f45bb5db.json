The first, 'Duwayne's life' ended on 22 April 1993 when he and his best friend waited for a bus home in south London. The second, his 'Stephen Lawrence life', began then and shows no sign of stopping. Even while the events of that night were unfolding he knew that he and his friend would always be in this together. As Stephen was attacked and murdered, people were looking on from the bus stop. As he lay bleeding to death on the pavement, cars were driving by, police at the scene. But it seemed to Duwayne, and it still seems now, that 'Steve and me were in our own bubble. This was just happening to us.' His Stephen Lawrence life has cast Duwayne in two roles, the confines of which he has resisted resolutely. He was, for a long time, the sole witness, the only person able - and prepared - to stand up in court and point a finger at his friend's half-dozen smirking attackers; in other eyes - those of the police and, it seems, the Lawrence family and their lawyers - he was almost an accessory to the murder, answering back to officers, leading Stephen astray, contradicting his own story. It has taken him nearly a decade, though, to realise that there was a third option: that he was, primarily, a victim in this narrative. He was often told, and always felt that he 'didn't have the right to be stressed or confused'; that he wasn't allowed to grieve for his friend; that he shouldn't have been angry about the way he was treated. Now he feels it is time he had his say. He has allowed some of that anger and confusion and grief to be expressed in a book, Steve and Me , powerfully written with the help of the Guardian 's Simon Hattenstone. He believes he can relate it all much more clearly now because, he says, 'it feels as though it is near the end. I always wanted to do a book, but earlier on, I did not have the full story. Now I do and I want to be free of it. I don't want my name to be associated just with Steve Lawrence any more, though I know in a way it will always be. But I am saying: this is the last chapter. If anyone ever asks me about it, from now on, I can say: read the book.' Reading the book, and talking to Duwayne, what strikes you most strongly is the sense of his being alone throughout much of this ordeal. He gives the impression of being single-minded and self-contained, by choice and by necessity. His parents split up when he was nine, he moved out from home when he was 16, and fended for himself in bedsits and hostels, put himself through college. In some ways, at the time of the murder, Stephen, whom he met on the first day of senior school, was the closest thing to family he had. One of the aims of the book is to make his friend real again, to separate him from the saintly mythology and the 'Lawrence industry'. Duwayne presents Steve (he never knew him as Stephen) as a young man caught between two very different worlds; between the overbearing ambition of his parents, particularly his mother, Doreen, and the more independent life that Duwayne and his friends represented. From the beginning of school, Stephen's parents were always telling him not to speak to Duwayne, suggesting he was a bad influence, a boy from a broken home, always with plenty to say for himself. Duwayne, meanwhile - fiercely bright, extremely direct - looked out for Stephen at school, tried to make him understand that he could not hide behind his mother for ever. 'People used to take the piss out of him too much,' he recalls. 'I'd say to him: don't let him say that to you - punch him in his mouth, but Steve never wanted to get in trouble. He'd say his mum never wanted him to get in a fight. So I'd always be getting involved for him. And with teachers, too. Teachers would often talk to the black kids like we were idiots - we were in the top maths group but they'd always encourage us to do football or basketball, never extra maths - and that used to get to me. They always used to attack Steve because they could say: we'll tell your mum and dad if you do such and such. And they would tell his parents and his mum would come walking into school like she was Queen of Sheba.' By the time he was 18 these tensions in Stephen's life had hardened, Duwayne suggests, into something like conflict. Stephen would go to Duwayne's hostel room to escape the pressure of home, where he was not allowed to watch TV and where he would be locked out if he came in later than 10.30 at night. They were the kind of tensions that nearly all teenagers face, but in Stephen's case they never had the chance to be resolved. As a result, in the minds of those closest to him, searching for explanations for the unexplainable horror of his murder, they have become irreconcilable. When she arrived at Accident and Emergency to learn of the death of her son, Doreen Lawrence turned to Duwayne and said: 'I knew it would have something to do with him.' Duwayne, for his part, believed that if it hadn't been for Doreen's strictness, the murder might well never have happened. It was because they were desperate to get home to beat Stephen's 10.30 curfew that they had got off the bus in Well Hall Road in Eltham, a notoriously racist district, at all. Always replaying the events in his mind, Duwayne has extrapolated from this fact a reason. 'I was helpless that night,' he says. 'If I'd had a car I'd have drove him to hospital. If I'd have known first aid, I'd have told the police what to do, made them help. But the main thing was that I would not have got off the bus. If I'd been on my own, I would never have got off there, I'd have gone the longer way round. But Steve thought he was going to be locked out again, and he had to get home. Being with me did not endanger his life. But the fear of being locked out by his parents in a racist area did.' This sense of blame was not helped by the fact that the Lawrences seemed determined to write Duwayne out of the story. He was denied a place in the church at the memorial service, never mentioned in the address. On the one occasion they spoke he could not find any words. 'I didn't know how to get it out of me without going nuts. I'd think I'm doing this [overcoming his fears of reprisals, his difficulties in reliving the events, to stand up in court] for them partly, and they were telling everybody it was my fault. I had some of Steve's stuff at my place and the family sent someone to collect his things, saying he would not have wanted me to have them, because he did not like me.' If the reaction of the Lawrences, in their grief, was almost understandable, the reaction of their lawyers was less so. Some of Duwayne's harshest criticism is reserved for Imran Khan, the Lawrences' solicitor, who made a name for himself during the case. Khan refused to answer Duwayne's calls, failed to turn up at the police station when he went through the unnerving process of ID parades (on which the case rested and ultimately fell), and did not show him his own witness statement, taken three years before - and containing mistakes of transcription - until he took the stand in the private prosecution of those accused of Stephen's murder. 'I didn't know any better at the time,' he says. 'I just thought that's how solicitors are.' (He subsequently sued Khan for negligence, in a case that was settled in his favour out of court.) Without the help of Khan, and apparently, he believes, too insignificant to be of much interest to the prosecution barrister Michael Mansfield QC (whose wife Yvette Vanson offered him \u00a350 to be involved in her film of the subsequent inquest), it was little wonder that Duwayne felt at the mercy of the police. What characterised his life immediately after Stephen's death was a mixture of anger and fear; mostly he kept this bottled up, but still, he noticed, he 'was always walking around on my toes on the street just in case I needed to run as hard as I could'. Having grown up in Deptford he always knew racism - 'if you were a black kid it was wise to be in your house if Millwall were playing at home' - and he recognised it in all his dealings with the Met. On the night of the murder they wanted to take a print from his training shoe (to implicate him, he believed in a robbery) and later accused him of breaking a window and of stealing soft drinks from the police station (neither claim remotely true). During the course of the investigation he was arrested for his involvement in a scuffle during a march on the BNP headquarters in Welling (a case later thrown out). Before the trial it was suggested he fabricated his identifications of the prime suspects; waiting to give his evidence he was ushered into a room with the families of the defendants; offered 'protection' he was taken to a hotel that was more of 'a backpackers' hostel' in Eltham, of all places - 'hair all over the bed, dirty and smelly, no TV'; one of the officers asked him if he would require the services of a prostitute. Thus, when the trial began, as Brian Cathcart points out in his definitive book, The Case of Stephen Lawrence , 'what was listed as the trial of Acourt, Knight and Dobson soon became, in effect, the trial of Duwayne Brooks'. Unprepared and nervous, before a battery of lawyers, Duwayne contradicted some of his own eyewitness reports and the case, already tenuous, collapsed. Had he regretted taking part? 'No,' he says, 'I'm glad that I did it, because if I hadn't done my best, to this day I would be blamed, and they'd have said if I had helped out we would have got a conviction. The fact was there was no real evidence. ' If Duwayne was deeply suspicious of the motivation of the police during the investigation and trial, however, his suspicions justly became paranoia in the years that followed. Having given evidence 'against' the police for the Macpherson Report, or at least because he was the living symbol of their institutional racism, he became convinced that he was being deliberately harassed. His car was broken into more times than he could care to remember, and the tools he used in his job as a photocopier engineer repeatedly stolen; he was stopped by police numerous times, and on one occasion assaulted. In 1999 he was arrested on a charge of attempted rape and held on remand in Belmarsh (the case was thrown out for lack of evidence). His life during this period, he says, has been saved by two things: the heroic efforts of his solicitor Jane Deighton ('If it was not for Jane I would not be here today. The police would have me in jail'). And an iron determination not to become 'the black street kid' the police had always apparently believed him to be: 'I had to be successful in life because I felt that was one of the things the police would have hated.' Duwayne lives in Crystal Palace now in a hostel run by a foundation he helps to administer; he keeps away from city streets at closing time; he enjoys go-karting when he can afford it; he helps to run Clapton football club, 'the only team to be owned by black people in the Ryman League'; and he keeps fit 'in case I have to run away from the police'. He will put money he makes from the book into the foundation, which runs programmes to help inner-city youth projects in the area. 'Our goal is to acquire some properties, old houses and do them up and move residents from the hostels into them.' He no longer dreams about the night of the murder, he says. He used to try to summon his nightmares, 'to try to evoke it all, to see what I missed and stuff. But there will never be another trial now, so there's no point.' In the book he talks about how he battled for years not to let himself cry about Stephen, because he did not want to let it all out. I wonder if he is able to do that now. 'No,' he says. 'Because crying makes you feel good. And I can't feel good.' If he dreams of anything, he says, these days, it is only being free of all of this, 'of starting Duwayne's life again'. And of finally laying that other life to rest. \u00b7 Steve and Me by Duwayne Brooks with Simon Hattenstone is published by Abacus at \u00a37.99.
