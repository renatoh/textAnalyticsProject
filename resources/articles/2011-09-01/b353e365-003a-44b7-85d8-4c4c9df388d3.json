Seventy-seven years is a long time to wait for any sporting hoodoo to end but Lancashire's thrilling victory over Somerset, which allowed them to overtake Warwickshire in the final hour of the season, was especially meaningful for their coach from Macclesfield. Apart from leading a largely anonymous team of mostly locally born young Lancastrians to an historic title, Moores's most satisfying achievement in cricket follows his painful demise as England coach in January 2009. In the 32 months since Kevin Pietersen engineered Moores's downfall, England have risen to world No1 in Test cricket. But Moores found a form of personal redemption which demanded riotous acknowledgement in Taunton. \"We had a couple of hours in the dressing room afterwards,\" Moores says, \"and that's often the best time. But we stayed tight as a team and went together to a bar next door and told stories all night long. Dave Roberts, who used to be our physio, suddenly arrived from nowhere. He'd been fishing in Scotland but decided to come all the way down to Taunton to join the party. It was a pretty good effort and summed up the spirit in my team.\" Amid the drinking, and the delirious happiness, there was time for reflection. Moores could have lost self-belief in the calamitous days after England fired him but he was saved from any lasting crisis by an early invitation to apply for the position as Lancashire's coach. \"I still believed in what I'd tried to do with England but [his axing] really came as a shock. It happened very quickly. And that's why the Lancashire job was so good for me. It didn't allow me to sit back and lick my wounds or become bitter. Within a week I'd got the call from them and I had to make a decision pretty much there and then. When I went for the first interview I wasn't even sure I wanted the job. But by the time I'd walked out of the interview I was desperate to get it. \"On my first day in the job the first person I saw was the car park attendant. He said 'You're Peter Moores aren't you? Well, good luck in your new job. Our side looks good on paper, don't it?' I agreed: 'Yeah, we look all right.' He then said [as Moores slips into his broadest Lancastrian accent]: 'Yeah, we're good on paper and crap on grass.' I thought: 'Welcome back to the north-west.'\" Dismissed before this season began, and compared unflatteringly with neighbouring Yorkshire, who were tipped as likely champions, Lancashire shocked everyone. Yorkshire, who were relegated, are still said to have a more talented squad. Is that insulting to Lancashire \u2013 or simply testament to Moores's ability to squeeze the most out of his unheralded players? \"You can never measure these things accurately,\" he says. \"But Yorkshire certainly have more recognised names than us. You go through our top seven: Paul Horton, Stephen Moore, Karl Brown, Luke Proctor, Steven Croft, Tom Smith and Gareth Cross \u2013 and people will say we've hardly heard of any of them. But that won't mean you won't hear of them in the future. \"We tried to prepare them like an international side. But we didn't really know if they could replicate it in match situations. Karl Brown had hardly played any first-class cricket before this season \u2013 same with Luke Proctor. Simon Kerrigan [their match-winning 21-year-old spinner] had only played a little. So they were unknown quantities \u2013 both to the opposition and ourselves.\" On the final morning of the season it seemed likely Warwickshire would win the title by defeating Hampshire \u2013 who were already relegated and reeling in their second innings. But Neil McKenzie, who made Moores suffer as England coach when he and Graeme Smith once batted all day at Lord's for South Africa, provided epic resistance for Hampshire. \"We knew Neil could do it,\" Moores says. \"I looked at my phone after an hour and Hampshire hadn't lost a wicket. I thought, 'Don't tempt fate. Don't look at your phone or a telly again.' All the superstitions came out. \"We also had this tortuous time where we didn't know where the next Somerset wicket was coming from. They went from 130 for seven to 311 for nine and we were just praying something would happen. We finally got the last wicket \u2013 a direct hit and a run-out. But the fact Somerset didn't roll over made it all the sweeter. \"Me and Glen Chapple [his 37 year-old captain] had to be at our best after the first day. Somerset were 314 for five and a game we had to win seemed to have slipped away. That was the big challenge to our belief. But we sat them down in the circle and said: 'Listen if we can bowl them out for under 400 we can still do something.' It went perfectly to plan after that and we won at a canter in the end. There was huge satisfaction because we had such hunger to win. We didn't perhaps expect it this season because we had such youngsters. But now, with so many players between 21 and 25, we can win much more together.\" Moores might be intent on creating a legacy for Lancashire but he can also claim to have played some part in England's remarkable rise. Asked where he contributed most during his difficult 20 months in charge of the national team he pinpoints three areas \u2013 player selection, appointing various support coaches and, most tellingly, in restructuring the national academy at Loughborough. \"I took over from Rodney Marsh at the Academy [in 2005] and as soon as I got there I sensed something was wrong. It was geared towards about 18 or so 23-year-olds. What it really needed to be was a performance centre that could support everything to do with England cricket. I had a big role to play in turning that academy into a performance centre and it was hard to do. \"It took a lot of convincing because people are always resistant to change. But to see it operating under David Parsons now makes me feel vindicated. He's a fantastic operator. It was my job to put those building blocks in place and to bring in the right support coaches. I appointed Andy Flower as batting coach, Richard Halsall as fielding coach and Mushtaq Ahmed as spinners' coach. Mushie comes from the sub-continent and he looks at cricket as an art \u2013 rather than a science. That offers real balance to an England set-up being managed so well by Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss.\" Flower, as Moores's replacement, has been a revelation. However, the current England head coach often argues that Moores instigated so many of the most positive changes Flower has developed further. Moores gave international debuts to some key England performers over the last two years \u2013 Jonathan Trott, Stuart Broad, Matt Prior and Graeme Swann. He also jettisoned Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison during a difficult tour of New Zealand. \"It was a big call to leave out two great cricketers but I thought it had to be done. We placed our faith in Jimmy Anderson. That turned out to be a really important moment for England. Jimmy had been out for a few years but we had belief in him \u2013 so he came in and Stuart Broad also played his first Test. Jimmy got five wickets and showed he could lead the attack. He could swing it at pace while Stuart was hugely impressive. He had great belief but a real hunger to learn.\" Pietersen still believes England owe him much for removing Moores and insists that their exalted position would never have been reached under their former coach. \"People make statements that are non-provable,\" Moores shrugs. \"Of course I think about the England job and wonder what might have been. But I've moved on. It's just someone's opinion and I know I did things with the best interests of England at heart. \"There are things I would do differently if I had another chance \u2013 but there's more I would do the same. There are always little moments where you think I could have handled that better. But you can do that every day of your life. I wouldn't change the general concept I brought to England. We were trying to move English cricket to a different place. Yes, they were already highly professional but we wanted to build something that was going to last. England are now in a position to do that.\" Did he fail to gain Pietersen's respect because Moores himself had never been an international cricketer? \"Possibly. You'd have to ask him. As a coach you need to build a relationship with a captain and that takes time. It's like a marriage. You're going to go through tough moments together and you're going to fall out at times. I've worked with different captains and it always takes time. For me the big frustration is that I didn't get that time. You also need mutual respect because the way I coach is to try and be as open as you possibly can. I know there is always more than one answer.\" Does Moores believe England would have become world No1 had he remained in charge? \"I don't know. We had visions of doing something like this but, as in life, you don't know how things will pan out in sport. In my time at England there were some really tight games where things didn't quite fall our way. But at Lancashire this season lots of tight games have gone our way. I've been in cricket long enough now to know you need commitment and will \u2013 but you also need the breaks. I don't think I got those breaks with England. This season, with Lancashire, I did. And of course it feels good to win. It feels great.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
