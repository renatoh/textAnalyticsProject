A statement from her campaign read that \u201cwhile this is not the result we wanted, Kirsten is proud of her aggressive, innovative and policy-driven campaign\u201d. In a video posted on Twitter, Gillibrand said that it was \u201cimportant to know when it\u2019s not your time and to know how you can best serve your community and country\u201d. \u201cI believe I can best serve by helping to unite us to beat Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d she added. Gillibrand launched her 2020 presidential bid in front of Donald Trump\u2019s eponymous hotel in midtown Manhattan on a windy afternoon in March where she called the billionaire a \u201ccoward\u201d. To counter Trump, she became the first Democratic candidate to release her tax returns, and vowed to only nominate supreme court judges who support women\u2019s reproductive rights. But in a field of 23, including a record number of women, her campaign never really got off the ground. She battled Joe Biden over his record on women\u2019s rights but failed to distinguish herself against the other progressives in the field, such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Despite having, she boasted, the most anti-Trump voting record in the race, she never got above the low single-digits in polls. And she had to wrestle with her record, including receiving an \u201cA\u201d rating from the NRA. As her campaign failed to set out a unique point of sale for her candidacy, she began to bristle at an emerging notion that only a man can beat Trump. \u201cThe evidence is contrary to that assumption,\u201d Gillibrand told the Guardian in May. \u201cI really believe that President Trump\u2019s Achilles heel is a woman who speaks her mind.\u201d \u201cI think his kryptonite is definitely a mother of young children who stands up for herself,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to be effective in demeaning or dismissing me. And if he tries, I think it not only makes me relevant but I think it will make him look small.\u201d Gillibrand has yet to endorse another candidate, but hinted that a woman might be best suited for the job. \u201cI think that women have a unique ability to bring people together and heal this country,\u201d she told the New York Times today. \u201cI think a woman nominee would be inspiring and exciting.\u201d Gillibrand said she felt she had helped \u201cmove the conversation\u201d. \u201cI would absolutely consider anything that was asked of me, because my goal is to serve,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI\u2019m going to do everything I can to make sure our nominee defeats Trump.\u201d Several of the remaining Democratic candidates responded to the news with praise for the senator and particularly her record on women\u2019s rights. \u201cThank you for being part of this race, @SenGillibrand, and for your unwavering commitment to fighting for women\u2014from reproductive rights to paid leave,\u201d tweeted Elizabeth Warren. Kamala Harris said: \u201cMy friend @SenGillibrand is a brave voice on some of the most critical issues facing our country today \u2014 from childcare to sexual assault. She is a champion and I know she\u2019s not done fighting for women and families everywhere.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
