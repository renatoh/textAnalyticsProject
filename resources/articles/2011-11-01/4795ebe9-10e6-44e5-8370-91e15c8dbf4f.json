And that was before Ed Balls had even started. George Osborne seemed especially smug. The growth figures were out and were very bad, but not as catastrophic as predicted. So he managed to look like the cat that had got not just the cream, but the finest, richest, thickest, clotted Jersey cream. He licked his cheeks with oozing pleasure. If he's like that when the numbers are awful, what on Earth will he resemble when they've improved? Assuming they do. Mind you, he wasn't helped by the Tories behind him. They know who the real enemies are. At number three, the Greek prime minister, because he is causing havoc for everyone. At number two, France, because it is French. No other reason needed. But at number one, the Liberal Democrats. Julian Lewis, a rightwinger, stood up, his face dank with loathing for the Lib Dems. If they had had their way, we would have joined the euro, with disastrous consequences. Now they were urging us to support fiscal integration in the eurozone. If the Lib Dems had been running a campaign to promote paedophilia as part of a healthy, balanced lifestyle, he could not have sounded more disgusted. Kevin Brennan for Labour said the economy was bumping along the bottom. \"It will take more than a hi-viz jacket to put that right!\" he exclaimed. No, I don't know what he meant either. \"This morning,\" declaimed the chancellor in reply, with the gravity of the Marquis of Salisbury announcing the Relief of Mafeking, \"we had the news that GDP grew by 0.5%!\" There seemed no reply to this except mocking laughter \u2013 plus ironic cries of \"whoo!\" \u2013 and that is the response it got. Mr Osborne was riled. When Chris Leslie pointed out that growth was weak, unemployment rising and industry contracting, the chancellor congratulated him on \"keeping his job in the Labour frontbench clear-out, though on the basis of that question I'm not sure why\". Ooh, missus! David Miliband got a more considered reply, but that is because the Tories affect to believe he is the Miliband brother who might have caused them problems. So courtesy to David was a jab at Ed. Next Labour's Fiona Mactaggart had a pop at Chloe Smith, a Treasury minister not yet 30. Unemployment among women was the highest it had been since the chancellor left university, \"which is probably when the Hon Lady left primary school\". That this is true (Osborne is 11 years her senior) didn't stop the barrage of mock fury. Ageism usually works the other way round. Osborne continued to be furious. The deficit was down from 8.9% to 5.3% of GDP, and those were real figures, \"rather than fiddled by the last chancellor's advisers\" \u2013 a reference to Gordon Brown and his backroom team, including Ed Balls. Who finally spoke. The economy was getting worse, and the country desperately needed a change. Balls had been absent last Thursday. \"We missed him last week,\" said the chancellor, lip curled as if moulded with hot tongs, \"though the tone of our debate markedly improved\".
