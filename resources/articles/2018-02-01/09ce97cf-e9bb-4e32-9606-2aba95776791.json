The imperative to get results remained absolute and the manager admits there have been times when he has felt the pressure. Pochettino has spent a net \u00a340.25m on permanent transfer deals across eight windows and he has watched the money he has helped to generate \u2013 principally, from two Champions League qualifications \u2013 go towards the stadium project. It has been tough to see rival big six clubs pour their profits into squad strengthening and Pochettino has often argued that comparisons between them and Tottenham are unfair. \u201cWe realised how difficult it was and how the process of moving from one stadium to another would be but we went through [with it],\u201d he said. \u201cI feel the responsibility to manage a club and a company \u2013 where you need results to be sure that the income will be at a level to start a process to build a new stadium and, also, to attract players and play Champions League. \u201cPeople say: \u2018Oh, Tottenham need to win a title,\u2019 but for me, our process is more than winning a title. The broadcasters give massive money to City, United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool and for them, it goes to investing [in new players]. For us, it is to build the project so that one day, we have the capacity to do the same or to change the philosophy. \u201cI looked at Liverpool\u2019s budget, because we played them last Sunday, and they invest double than us. But this is not the time, after three years and nine months at the club, that we invest. We don\u2019t do anything crazy and we keep improving.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
