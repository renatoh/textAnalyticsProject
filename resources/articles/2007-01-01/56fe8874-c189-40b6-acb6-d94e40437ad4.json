Over to my esteemed colleague Rob Smyth, whose excellent Fiver explains why every Spurs fan I know is looking forward to tonight's game with all the enthusiasm of a young boy being told it's Caesar salad for dinner. Here it is in full... \"There are no values or respect in society anymore: nobody gives up their seat on the bus for an old lady, chivalry disappeared along with Bobby Charlton's fringe, and while once upon a time the man next door was your friend, your confidant and your wife's bit on the sly, these days people are more likely to shove thy neighbour. Take Arsene Wenger with Spurs: he nicked their swaggering style, their best player and, last season, their Big Cup place. And he's lost only once in 22 over-the-back-garden-fence kickabouts. \"But Wenger may be about to foist an even greater humiliation upon the man next door - by dumping Spurs out of the Carling Cup with his reserves. The first leg, at White Hart Lane, is tonight, and Wenger is unlikely to drop the likes of Theo Walcott, Julio Baptista, Abou Diaby and Denilson. 'It is very difficult to say \"Listen you are good enough to beat Liverpool, but you are not good enough to play at Tottenham\",' said Wenger, contradicting himself by saying it perfectly. 'They deserve it. They have earned the right.' \"Tottenham can't really win - if they win, they've beaten a reserve team; if they lose, they'll have to hide their humiliation with a N17 version of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' - and Arsenal can't really lose. But Spurs boss Tony Soprano begs to differ. 'Their second team is probably as strong as any side outside of the top four,' he tubtapped meekly to Dr Melfi. 'You can go on about a kids' team all you like but this is definitely not just a kids' team, capeesh?' Jol remains desperate to end Spurs' eight-year wait for a trophy, mind. 'It is the only thing in football. Are you potential winners or are you average? That is what we have to find out.' He should be careful what he wishes for.\" Kick-off has been delayed by 15 minutes because the Arsenal coach is stuck in traffic. What does it matter if Arsene Wenger's not there for the start? Oh, the Arsenal coach, as in bus. Well, why not make them get the underground like everyone else going to this match? Kick-off is now 8.15pm. Teams Tottenham Robinson, Chimbonda, Dawson, Gardner, Benoit Assou-Ekotto, Lennon, Zokora, Huddlestone, Malbranque, Berbatov, Defoe. Subs Cerny, Young-Pyo Lee, Ghaly, Keane, Mido. Arsenal Almunia, Hoyte, Toure, Senderos, Traore, Denilson, Fabregas, Diaby, Julio Baptista, Aliadiere, Walcott. Subs Poom, Hleb, Flamini, Eboue, Randall. Referee G Poll (Hertfordshire) Tottenham, as expected, name their strongest available XI, with Jermaine Defoe preferred to Robbie Keane as Dimitar Berbatov's partner up front. Monsieur Wenger has overcome the temptation to play Arsenal Ladies, picking a slightly stronger than expected line-up. Three of his senior players are in it, with Kolo Toure and Phillipe Senderos at the heart of the defence, and Cesc Fabregas in front of them. Other than those three though, it's the kids - and I suppose it should be remembered that neither Senderos and Fabregas are over the hill yet either. Oh, and it shouldn't go unmentioned that tonight's referee is Hertfordshire's favourite man in black, the Milk Tray Ma... sorry, Mr Graham Poll. Expect fireworks. Pre-match warm-up on a very cold night. Though not as cold as last night. \"Can you tell me what Chimbonda is wearing if he's playing,\" asks David Killick. He is playing, but just not yet. \"He usually wears mittens, bobble hat and a duffle coat in the middle of august. I am expecting he'll be wearing a balaclava, ugg boots, and be carrying a flask of tea as he runs up and down the wing.\" The Arsenal players aren't averse to wearing black gloves either. \"The Arsenal coach is delayed as they had to stop off at McDonalds for 11 Happy Meals,\" chuckles Jon Haines, \"An Arsenal Fan!\". \"Your aside about the coach being stuck in traffic - the bus, not Arsene - puts me in mind of the time I made a similar mistake on hearing of reports that the team coach had been stoned after a match,\" recalls Rosie Spowart. \"Any chance one of the more clued-up readers can give us a comparision of prices paid for each team? I'm just getting the feeling that Arsenal's 'youth' team may have cost as much as the Tottenham lot,\" says Alan Williams. Over to you, boffins. \"I think there is a little rule that actually doesn't allow this, but maybe if Spurs could start without Arsenal, they could go a few goals up, and get some breathing room,\" suggests Nick Claxtion. They could, but they'd have to win the toss and elect to kick-off first and be careful not to be offside at any stage before scoring the first goal. Then they would have to wait for one of the Arsenal players to turn up to restart the match, unless of course the ref decided that Arsenal's non-appearance constituted time-wasting. Then ... actually, I haven't really thought this through. Prediction time \"I think tonight will be exciting and just have a feeling that Arsenal may come unstuck against Spurs,\" says one of my uncles, called Derek. Or Uncle Derek, as I call him. \"Apart from Toure, I think the centre of their defence is iffy and Berbatov, Defoe/Keane and co might just exploit it. On the other hand, I think Michael Dawson is a bit overrated and might find Baptista a handful. Prediction: 3-1 to Spurs.\" My Uncle Derek is not someone you argue with when it comes to football. That said, I can't be seen to be copying him exactly, so I'll plump for 2-1 Spurs. Raymond Starke's prediction \"My prediction: 7-0. With our current away form, this result should set up a mouthwatering return at the Emirates next week,\" says Raymond, who also makes a libelous remark about the Gunners that can't be printed here. One last email during the ads \"Kickoffs seem to be delayed far too often in the UK for traffic reasons,\" observes Rob Hisnay. \"This never happens here in N. America. Is London traffic/transport system that bad?\" One-word answer is all that's required here, Rob: yes. 1 min And we're off. Sixty seconds in, and Graham Poll is yet to do something ludicrous. Give it time though. Isn't it incredible to think that he was actually on course to officiate the World Cup final until his three-card trick? 2 mins Great play from Lennon! Fed the ball by Chimbonda, he sped past Diaby and Traore, but Hoyte just managed to divert his cross away before Berbatov could tap it home. 4 mins Zokora has the first shot of the evening, but it's embarrassingly weak. However, he can be forgiven because he seems to be the only player on the pitch not wearing gloves. 5 mins Berbatov hits the post! After strongly shaking off the challenge of Toure, the forward wrongfooted Almunia by aiming for the near post, but the ball flashed off the outside of the upright for a goal kick. This has been a very lively start by Spurs. 7 mins \"Am obliged to follow you as the overpriced channel that I purchased in the United States is 'interrupted',\" says Baiju Vasani, not realising just how special he makes me feel. \"How annoying. That means the entire continent of North America can't watch the game right now. (Even though that probably only consists of eight \"soccer\" fans who actually want to see the game. I include myself in that number, in case you were wondering.)\" Oh well, you've doubled my audience, Baiju. 8 mins It's been a great start to the game. Aliadiere burst through the middle but took too long to get his shot off. However, Dawson's last-ditch challenge sent the ball in Fabregas's direction, the Spaniard taking the ball round Robinson but failing to put enough oomph on his shot to send it past Gardner on the line. 10 mins \"It's back on!\" shrieks Baiju, instantly switching his computer off. 11 mins Spurs appeal for a penalty when Dawson heads across goal, but the ball struck Senderos's chest rather than his arm or hand. GOAL! Tottenham 1 - 0 Arsenal (Berbatov 12) First blood to Spurs! Defoe's floated cross to the six-yard box looked harmless enough, but Toure left it to Almunia, who left it to Toure, and Berbatov had the simple task of nodding the ball past the keeper. It's no more than Spurs deserve for their blistering start. 14 mins \"Even as a Spurs fan I have to admit we have no chance,\" wrote Carl Hilland, moments before the goal. \"Arsenal have players like Walcott, Fabregas &amp; Toure. We have Gardner, Zokora &amp; the rubbish Berbatov. Get Jol out &amp; bring in a decent manager.\" Still feel the same way, Carl? 16 mins Brilliant link-up play between the Spurs front two. Zokora rolled a ball into Defoe, but his dummy allowed it to run onto Berbatov. The Bulgarian then threaded a superb first-time pass to Defoe, but his shot was palmed away by Almunia. 18 mins Sub for Spurs: Berbatov off, Keane on. That's a real shame - Berbatov looks to have strained a muscle when scoring. Jol doesn't like playing Keane and Defoe together, so it will be interesting to see how they interact. 19 mins At least it would have been interesting to see how they interact. In response to the enforced substitution, Jol has changed the Spurs formation to 4-5-1, with Lennon and Keane wide. GOAL! Tottenham 2 - 0 Arsenal (Baptista og 20) A hilarious own goal. Huddlestone, who will be in the England team at the 2010 World Cup incidentally (assuming we qualify), took a free-kick from a wide position level with the 18-yard-box. Dawson tried an audacious flick at the near post - think Zola v Norwich, Kanu v Boro, Sharpe v Barcelona - but completely missed it, only to turn round and watch Baptista inadvertently perform that very same trick - past his own keeper! Wenger looks very sheepish on the Arsenal bench. 23 mins \"It's good to see that Spurs have fallen into the same trap as Man Utd, Hamburg, Barnet et al of taking the lead against Arsenal,\" says Hugh Watson. \"It's like poking a bear's bum with a sharp stick: they'll be lucky if they get away with just getting their hands dirty. Uh-oh they've just done it again. That's going to be an angry bear.\" 25 mins Spurs are totally outplaying Arsenal here. The young Gunners aren't getting any time on the ball, and are losing every 50-50 challenge going. 27 mins I thought that comment would spur Arsenal on. A prolonged spell of slick passing culminated in a give-and-go between Hoyte and Aliadiere, but Dawson launched his body in the way of Hoyte's low shot. \"Arsenal, are they Liverpool in disguise?\" quips Damien Neva, exhibiting either an anti-Liverpool or anti-Arsenal bias - depends on your point of view. 29 mins Apoplectic that he's not had enough of an influence on the game so far (ignoring the fact that the Spurs free-kick for the second goal was never actually a foul), Poll intervenes when Baptista makes a brilliant tackle on Zokora. Out comes the yellow card - two more of those and you're off, son. 31 mins Booking No2, and this one is far more clear-cut. Lennon was in the midst of one of his trademark bursts before Toure cynically tripped him. 33 mins Booking No3 - Defoe scythes down Traore. A fair decision. \"7-0 is about one goal every 13 minutes,\" says Raymond Starke, suddenly becoming very excited about his pre-match prediction. \"Spurs are on course! Next goal around the 39th minute. Or have I just jinxed it by saying this?\" We'll know in six minutes' time. 36 mins Nearly a second own goal from an Arsenal player. Keane whipped in a corner to the near post, Aliadiere swung his right boot at it, sending it goalwards - but the alert Almunia grasped the unexpected deflection. 39 mins \"I am sick and tired of your anti-Chelsea bias,\" says John Flanders. \"A simple ctrl+F on your web page reveals no instances of \"Chelsea\", \"Jose\", or \"Terry\" or \"God.\" You are making millions off their brilliance, and show no thanks. This is the last minute by minute I'll ever read.\" 40 mins Spurs have been less fluent since switching to 4-5-1, but they're still causing Arsenal plenty of problems from set pieces. Toure shanks one corner behind for another. 41 mins Lennon plays it short, then whips the return to the back post where Traore does his best impression of his brother Djimi, ie tries to score an own goal. He missed, of course. He is a Traore after all. 44 mins It's a slightly strange atmosphere inside White Hart Lane. Obviously the Spurs fans are revelling in being 2-0 up against their bitter rivals, but there's not the same passion (or vitriol, if you prefer) emanating from the stands as usual - presumably because of the strange circumstances of Arsenal playing their reserves. 45 mins + 1 Lennon wins a corner in stoppage-time. Can Spurs score a third? No, though Dawson should have done better than head over from 10 yards. 45 mins + 2 What a miss! Baptista! Presented with an almost identical chance to the one he converted at the other end, again he missed his kick, and again he saw the ball go in the opposite direction to the way he had hoped. Fabregas's corner reached him unmarked at the back post, but he mistimed the swing of his left foot, and the ball hit his standing right leg and deflected away from the goal. Half time Spurs are just about good value for their lead, though Arsenal have grown in confidence as the half has progressed. One thing I'll guarantee - this game won't finish 2-0. Your half-time thoughts \"Is it just me or has Toure played nearly every game for Arsenal this year,\" asks Andre Moulton. \"After hearing how the first goal was scored, I wonder if the young man can't be a tad physically and mentally exhausted.\" You make a good point, Andre. Toure didn't play in the early rounds of the League Cup, nor in the FA Cup third round, but he has played in 33 games already this season. That said, the first goal was just a blatant mix-up. It looks like Almunia called for it, Toure ducked, but then Almunia stayed on his line. Mind you, the first rule of defending is to clear your lines if in any doubt. \"Has it ever occurred to you to lie about the match, just to make things interesting?\" asks Dan Barron. Yes. \"How can those of us stuck at work know for sure that Arsenal isn't really 4-0 up?\" I tried that last night - writing that Wycombe had scored against Chelsea. It seems people don't greatly enjoying having their hopes raised unnecessarily. \"Seems that fashion news is more important than I thought in football commentary,\" says Leigh Caldwell, who answered my call for an assistant last night by actually turning up at GU Towers. No kidding. Very useful he was too - writing an excellent Quiz. \"Five Live hasn't mentioned the gloves yet but they're extolling Theo Walcott's white boots. Funny that; I associate Essex girls more with Spurs than Arsenal.\" \"Just thought I'd write in to say that I hate Tottenham,\" says Dplanet. Come on now, that's not very nice. \"But I always enjoy the minute-by-minutes.\" Oh, well you're forgiven then. 46 mins The start of the second half is delayed when nobody is quite certain whose kick-off it is. Graham Poll has to wander off the pitch to speak to some silver-haired chap, who seems to have the answer. Finally Baptista's right foot gets us underway, though whether he meant it to is debatable given its performance in the first half. 48 mins Bright start from Arsenal, Aliadiere firing a shot wide of Robinson's goal. Arsene Wenger's anguish on the touchline suggests he won't be happy with a defeat in this tie. 50 mins It turns out there was a power failure in the tunnel at half-time, and the officials' changing room was pitch black throughout the interval. You might say Graham Poll was as much in the dark as we've been over some of his first-half decisions. 52 mins \"I am the only one to realise what Baptista is doing here?\" asks David Bradshaw. Erm, I think so. \"He's thinking 'Clearly my inept performances have not made a bad enough impression of me yet. Maybe if I play like Stan Collymore did in his later years they will send me back to beautiful sunny Spain where I can at least stay warm sitting on the bench'.\" Could be right. I think Collymore scored four goals at Anfield too - though it took him about 25 games. 54 mins The pattern for the second half is set. Arsenal are enjoying the vast majority of possession, but the Spurs front three of Keane, Defoe and Lennon have a fine blend of guile and pace on the counter-attack. The majestic Huddlestone breaks up another Arsenal move, threading the ball up to Defoe, but his attempted trick to bypass Toure doesn't come off. 56 mins \"Agree wholeheartedly,\" writes Mark Oliver, two words I've never received in my inbox before. \"Huddlestone is the defensive midfielder we have been looking before (who could also fill in at centre back if required). He is big, strong, tackes and can pass. May be a little one paced, but that hasn't stopped Carrick. Speaking of ex-Wolves players, I reckon Jo Lescott can't be too far away from an England cap either - playing brilliantly for Everton, mostly out of position at left back too.\" 57 mins Arsenal sub: Diaby off, Hleb on. A signal of intent from Wenger. Moments later, Walcott takes on Assou-Ekotto, but the young left-back wins that battle. He's barely allowed Walcott a kick tonight. 59 mins Arsenal sub: Aliadiere pulls up with a hamstring injury (I think, I wasn't watching terribly closely if I'm honest), Eboue comes on. Walcott has gone up front, while Eboue will be looking to whip in crosses from the right wing like he did for Henry's winner against United. 61 mins Cleared off the line! Fabregas curled in a free-kick at pace, Robinson completely missed it having committed himself, but Dawson had dropped onto the line and nodded the ball away. Spurs are suffering from a serious bout of Englanditis here - they're inviting Arsenal onto them, and it could be costly. GOAL! Tottenham 2 - 1 Arsenal (Baptista 64) It's been coming. Baptista knocked a short ball into his new strike-partner Walcott (who's done more in the centre in five minutes than he did in an hour on the wing), who cleverly flicked the ball back into the path of the Brazilian. The Beast powerfully shrugged off Dawson's challenge, then cooly slotted past Robinson from close range. 66 mins A brilliant intervention from Zokora prevents Arsenal equalising. Baptista was again the creator, holding off Gardner before squaring towards Walcott. But Zokora intercepted before the youngster could score. 68 mins One half of this game has been totally dominated by Spurs, the other half has been totally dominated by Arsenal. If only there was a term to describe such a game where the first half is different to the second half, it would be very fitting here. 70 mins Defoe terrorises Senderos on a rare Spurs break, but the time in white are either too tired or too scared to throw men forward, so he only has one man (Keane) to pick out with his cross. He couldn't do it. 72 mins Eboue has been excellent since coming on, his power and pace too heady a mix for Assou-Ekotto to deal with. Which doesn't say much for Walcott's earlier showing against the left-back. 73 mins There's no stopping Lennon at times. With the slightest drop of the shoulder he was past Traore, but neither Defoe nor Keane anticipated his drilled cross along the six-yard box, and Toure cleared. 75 mins Fabregas tests out Robinson's handling with a low curler, but the England keeper is up to it. He hasn't been up to too much this season though - his form must be worrying McClaren. Forget Kirkland and Carson, Robinson's successor will be Ben Foster. GOAL! Tottenham 2 - 2 Arsenal (Baptista 77) I don't believe it - right on cue, some truly dreadful goalkeeping. First off, it was pretty hopeless defending, Assou-Ekotto totally ignorant of the fact that Hoyte had run in behind him. However, quite why Robinson came dashing out when there was no chance of Hoyte shooting from a tight angle is totally beyond me. It made Hoyte's job of laying a 15-yard pass across the box to Baptista easy, and the Beast slid home his third goal of the game into an empty net. \"England's number one!\" is the chant from the jubilant Arsenal fans. 79 mins Tottenham almost regain the lead! Chimbonda played in Defoe, but he didn't put enough power behind his shot when he tried to lift the ball over Almunia. 81 mins Sub for Spurs: Defoe off, Mido on. Arsenal sub: Hleb, who's limping, off, Flamini on. Why didn't Jol bring on Mido as a direct replacement for Berbatov earlier when they were murdering Arsenal, rather than bring on Keane and change their style of play? 83 mins This has been a cracking game. The second leg should be just as good. \"The term you are searching for ('a term to describe such a game where the first half is different to the second half') is 'dichotomatch,' I believe,\" says Powell Draper, reaching for a proverbial nail and hitting it on its proverbial head. 84 mins Fabregas, who has been both omnipotent and omnipresent tonight, curls a gorgeous cross to the back stick, but Walcott shanks his half-volley wide. 86 mins Aaron Lennon clips another ever-so-tempting cross along the six-yard box, but yet again there's nobody there to take advantage. \"Schizoathletic,\" says Eric Kennedy, offering a different word. \"a. of, or relating to, a split contest.\" 89 mins While Jol's tactics may come under serious scrutiny, this young Arsenal team deserves immense credit. It looked like they might be blown away after half an hour, but since then they've looked like the men to Tottenham's boys. If anyone's going to get a winner, it's them. 90 mins + 1 Lennon skins Traore for the 2,675th time, but his cross is headed away by somebody or other. Full time The Arsenal fans' summary of the match is pretty accurate: \"Two-nil, and you ****ed it up.\" That's precisely what Spurs did, changing their approach and conceding the initiative when Arsenal were there for the taking. That said, Arsenal's response was breathtaking. Had the Gunners gone into the second leg with a deficit, it would have been very interesting to see whether Arsene Wenger recalled the big guns to the starting line-up. As it stands, I can't see any reason why he won't trust the same players to complete the job at the Emirates. Thanks for your emails. Join us here next week for the second leg, Mike."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
