Defeat by Aston Villa at the weekend exposed familiar frailties at the heart of Chelsea's line-up and fatigue has already seeped into this team's preparations. \"It's not easy,\" said the Italian. \"But I think it's even more difficult for Atl\u00e9tico at the moment.\" Any sense of trauma is relative. Chelsea, not for the first time this season, were muscled into defeat at set plays at Villa Park but remain within a point of the Premier League's summit and, having conducted their own inquest, will presumably be steeled for future encounters. In contrast Atl\u00e9tico, who were never likely to boast the same threat from set pieces as English opposition, arrive saddled by their worst start to a domestic season in 15 years and without a win, or even a goal, in Group D. The air has been cleared on the training ground after Saturday's setback, unpalatable truths acknowledged by all concerned at the defensive lapses that cost Chelsea, with Ancelotti's only lingering frustration the reality that he would, more normally, have sought to rest players either against Villa or Atl\u00e9tico. \"It's important that the players speak about these situations and talk together about things that might go wrong,\" he said. \"By doing that we can improve. We did the same at Milan. I have always believed the players have to take responsibility and we have the same way here. \"But for the last game against Aston Villa I had to use eight players who had played 90 minutes for their countries in the midweek internationals. If there was the possibility to change some players, I would have liked to have done this. For the game against Madrid I would like to make some changes, to use some rotation. But the problem is, against Villa, there was no Michael Ballack or Mikel John Obi, so it was difficult to make changes. Mikel is not fit [to start], nor Yuri Zhirkov, Joe Cole, Alex or Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa, while Didier Drogba is suspended.\" Those might be considered critical absentees were Atl\u00e9tico's recent form not so wretched. Ancelotti has spoken of the need to move eight points clear of the Spaniards, a concession that the visitors retain a potent threat with the likes of Diego Forlan and Sergio Ag\u00fcero \u2013 a long-standing Chelsea target \u2013 in their ranks, but the efforts of that strikeforce have been undermined by vulnerability at the back. Abel Resino's side are slumped in 15th place in their league, a point clear of relegation, having shipped 17 goals in seven games. \"The danger is that everyone expects us to win this game because Atl\u00e9tico haven't started the season well,\" said Michael Ballack, who returns this evening as Bosingwa, his European suspension served, succumbs to a knee injury. Win tonight and progress can be secured at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n stadium in a fortnight, and Chelsea will be relieved that Atl\u00e9tico's principal threat will be from slick inter-changes on the floor rather than an aerial bombardment at set pieces, tactics that have yielded rewards for Stoke, Wigan and Villa. \"Of course, that's how the weaker teams in the Premier League try to score against us,\" added Ballack. \"Most of the time we'll have more possession of the ball but on set pieces \u2013 even on a throw-in at Stoke \u2013 those are their strengths. We're not the only team who have conceded from a throw-in against Stoke, mind you. They have a lot of big guys and it's not always easy to defend, especially in England. But we are in a good position in this group \u2013 we are top and have won both our games, remember \u2013 and we have a home game now. We are an experienced team and everyone knows what he has to do against Atl\u00e9tico. We believe in ourselves.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
