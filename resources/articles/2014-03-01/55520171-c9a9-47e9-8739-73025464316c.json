Cameos from TV faces and a summery visual sheen provide further distractions from the script's fundamental issues of cred: you just don't believe Owen's hapless protagonist would get as far as he does. Hard to dislike entirely, but that initial pep wears off \u2013 and it's sad that any project should now be wasting Vicky McClure in the tagalong girlfriend role."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
