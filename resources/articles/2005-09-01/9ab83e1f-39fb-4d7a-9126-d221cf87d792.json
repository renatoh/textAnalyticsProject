His three chortling buddies try to fix him up with some action in various gross-out contexts, but he falls in love with a businesswoman played by Catherine Keener. At nearly two hours this is too long, and for those of us who cherish Keener's outstanding work in Being John Malkovich, it is painful to see her reduced to the role of straight woman in something that looks like an immature and non-Oscar-winning version of Sideways. (Keener really does deserve to win an Oscar. Can't Alexander Payne cast her in something?) There are some great lines, though - particularly when two of the guys start taunting each other in a non-PC orgy of bad taste: \"You know how I know you're gay, man? You like Coldplay.\" Ouch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
