If fashion channels the mood of the times, it is striking when a house whose exclusive logo-stamped luggage has made it a global byword for aspirational living declares the past a more appealing reference than the future. Especially when the designer is Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, whose mood boards are usually a blend of science fiction costumes, Japanese anime motifs and landmarks of modernist architecture. The collection was a love letter to a postcard version of Paris: the age of Folies Berg\u00e8re and the Eiffel Tower, curlicued lamps on the banks of the Seine and art nouveau metro signs. Ghesqui\u00e8re said he wanted to explore \u201cdandyism, and those particular snobberies that would later become what is known as French elegance\u201d. The clothes channelled the mood music of Paris at its most charming, rather than being literal in their retro-reference. Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s futuristic clothes tend to be what is referred to politely, in fashion-speak, as \u201ccostume-adjacent\u201d, but this collection was extremely wearable and immediately desirable. High-waisted, wide-legged trousers were worn with silk blouses layered under tailored blazers. Belted trench coats and clean-lined shifts were worn with block-heeled loafers or moccasins. Handbags were timelessly elegant \u2013 and even sensibly sized, rather than minuscule \u2013 with graceful top handles. The show took place in a courtyard of the Louvre, where a vast video screen showed Scottish musician Sophie, who chooses not to disclose a gender identity, performing It\u2019s Okay to Cry, a song described in a Guardian review as \u201ca power ballad about an identity-based struggle \u2026 hideous and heartrending, an overacted meditation on self-acceptance that could easily prompt real tears\u201d. In a blockbuster commercial evening, this was the only nod to the alternative aesthetic leanings for which Ghesqui\u00e8re is usually known. Louis Vuitton was valued in May at $39.3bn (\u00a332bn), putting it well ahead of Chanel, its closest competitor \u2013 and it is getting bigger. This year, the brand has had a series of major perfume launches, while ambitious plans for a greater slice of the \u201chard luxury\u201d market, in watches and fine jewellery, are next."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
