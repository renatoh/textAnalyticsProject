With his OBE confirmed, David Beckham, the lord of Beckingham Palace, can prepare for an audience with the Queen after being honoured at the age of 28. Labour MP Paul Farrelly complained last night about Beckham's OBE award. But, like the MBEs awarded in the 1960s to the Beatles, who endured and enjoyed similar levels of fame, the public are likely to cheer a young man who remains very good at his job."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
