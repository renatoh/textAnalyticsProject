This record, his first in five years, certainly has the markings of a personal voyage. As well as being self-produced, it is full of candid, heartfelt anecdotes mixed with committee-free experimentation. New wave influences ripple throughout; Rubber Ballz has psychedelic qualities; Mildenhall is an Americana track that recalls his teen years in the UK and starting to discover music; the mechanical vocals in the verse of Cherry Hearts sound as if he\u2019s channelling a robot. Name for You \u2013 inspired by his three daughters \u2013 finds him in paternal mode, giving a pep talk: \u201cThey\u2019re just afraid of you speaking your mind.\u201d Heartworms is an album of tinkering and pootling, the sound of a man reminiscing on life, referencing his favourite records \u2013 less rock star, more bloke living out his hobby from the comfort of a suburban garage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
