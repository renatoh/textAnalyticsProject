In a new report, Death and taxes: the true cost of tax dodging, the charity says the sums being lost to tax evasion globally are equivalent to almost one and a half times the amount of foreign aid given to poor countries each year. If legal tax avoidance were added in, the sums would be several times greater. If the money lost to illegal evasion were allocated according to current spending patterns to prevent poverty and disease, it says, the lives of 350,000 children, 250,000 of them infants, could be saved each year. \"We predict that illegal, trade-related tax evasion alone will be responsible for the deaths of some 5.6 million children under the age of five between 2000 and 2015,\" says Christian Aid director Daleep Mukarji. The charity blames the secrecy offered by more than 70 tax havens, including Monaco and Switzerland, for the widespread abuses and accuses the big accountancy firms of facilitating the evasion. Separate research for the TUC showed companies and wealthy individuals are manipulating the British tax system to avoid \u00a325bn of tax each year. Accounting tricks, exploiting loopholes and simple avoidance were undermining government revenues and disguising how much tax is paid by businesses and the better-off. Brendan Barber, TUC general secretary, said in February that unpaid tax costs every British worker \u00a31,000 a year. If only a fraction of the missing tax were collected by Revenue &amp; Customs, it would plug the gap in the government's spending plans and save schools, hospitals and other public services from cuts, says its report, The Missing Billions. The TUC said it hoped it would spark a debate on tax compliance and whether there should be a curb on legitimate avoidance. The research was carried out by chartered accountant Richard Murphy, a former KPMG tax specialist who said he spent a year analysing Revenue &amp; Customs data and the annual reports of Britain's top 50 companies. He said it showed the firms' effective corporation tax rate was 22.5% and not the official rate, which was 30%. Large corporations also paid 5% less on average than the tax figure in their accounts. The use of accounting rules allowing firms to defer tax payments accounted for more than 80% of the unpaid tax by business, said the report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
