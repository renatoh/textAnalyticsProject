A letter signed by Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor for the Roman Catholic church, David Coffey, the Free Churches' moderator, Sir Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi, and Zaki Badawi, chair of the Council of Mosques and Imams, urges Mr Blair as host of the meeting to push \"with urgency\" for changes to structures and practices that result in suffering and privation. The letter states that 30,000 people a day die avoidably and adds: \"The security and wellbeing of all the nations depends on the security and wellbeing of each nation. A world divided by poverty cannot be healed without justice.\" It is the first time that a joint letter has been written since the same leaders appealed unsuccessfully for peace in Iraq in March 2003, just before the US-led invasion. The letter says: \"We start from the reality that at the heart of our three great Abrahamic faiths stands a shared vision of what is owed by right to those who are most in need. For Christian, Jew and Muslim alike, a world that fails to offer a full measure of compassionate justice to all our brothers and sisters, whoever and wherever they may be, is a world that is failing to meet God's design for humanity.\" \"It means using our own wealth and prosperity to the benefit of all; it means promoting good governance for every citizen.\" Dr Williams, who is hosting a forum of British and international faith representatives at Lambeth Palace today, is also leading a delegation to meet the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in advance of the summit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
