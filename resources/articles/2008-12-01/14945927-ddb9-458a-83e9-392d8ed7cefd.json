The south and south-west of England were worst affected with fire services reporting scores of calls overnight. Floodwaters in some areas were nearly one metre deep, fire services said. Dual carriageways in Devon and Somerset were under up to 50cm of water. Trees have fallen and some people were trapped in their cars. A 22-year-old woman motorist died when her car crashed off the road during heavy rain in Dorset. Police said it was too early to say whether the weather was a contributory factor to the crash, which happened on the A35 at Upton, Poole, at 2.05am. A tree toppled on to a block of flats in heavy winds, causing 10 people to be evacuated from their homes in Emsworth, Hampshire. Officers in Somerset and Devon answered 300 calls, including 20 rescues from cars and two dozen reports of minor house flooding, said Norman Evans of Devon fire and rescue. He said conditions on the roads were \"atrocious\" and urged motorists to travel only if the trip was absolutely necessary. A number of major roads, including the M4, A30 and A303 were affected. Train services between London and Bristol were experiencing severe delays while trains from London to Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance were cancelled. The torrential rain moved from Cornwall and Devon to Somerset and towards the Dorset-Wiltshire border. The worst affected areas were Chard, Ilminster, Shepton Mallet, Glastonbury and Street. There were also reports of flooding in Boscastle and Launceston in Cornwall. The Environment Agency had 43 flood warnings in place for England. One severe warning was in place on the River Lyd, near Lydney in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. \"Rain came into Devon just after midnight. It travelled through into Somerset around 4am,\" said Evans. \"It is now moving off into Dorset and Wiltshire. There is still extensive road flooding and there's a lot of sludge and debris from high winds. Trees are down. \"There's a lot of mud on the fields and that has caused a lot of accidents. People have been stuck in between 18in and 3ft of flood water.\" About 270 homes are thought to be flooded in Somerset, with most of the problems concentrated in the southern third of the county. Firefighters were called to homes in Stourbridge, West Midlands, which flooded after drains overflowed following overnight downpours. Horse racing at Cheltenham was abandoned due to waterlogging. The Cheshire fire and rescue service said it rescued one woman from the roof of a car after flooding in Crewe. An inch of hail fell near Hayle, Cornwall, shortly after 1pm and was linked to at least three road accidents on the A30 in the area. A number of people were taken to hospital following a collision between two cars, Devon and Cornwall police said. In another incident, a few minutes later, a car flipped on its roof. The occupants were believed to have suffered minor injuries. Weather forecasters were expecting up to 40mm of rain overnight and today. The flood alerts came as experts said the UK had experienced its coldest start to winter in more than 30 years. The first third of December has seen an average temperature of 1.7C according to the Met Office. That is a marked drop on the long-term average of 4.7C. Michael Dukes, the forecast manager at MeteoGroup UK, the weather division of the Press Association, said: \"It certainly has been a very cold start to December. \"The reason is that the Atlantic's been fairly quiet. We've had polar air dominating the UK's weather - air originally from Greenland or the North Pole.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
