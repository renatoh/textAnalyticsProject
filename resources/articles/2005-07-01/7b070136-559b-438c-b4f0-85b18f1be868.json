Terrorism, it seems, is in the minds of everyone, irrespective of their cultural background. So, understandably, the atmosphere is one of tense anxiety as people are vigilant and wary of anyone who looks like an Islamic fundamentalist. No one would dare leave their luggage unattended, as all public places - shops, banks, tube and rail stations - are now tightly guarded like international ports. On Wednesday, I took the train from Euston to Birmingham after having spent the best part of four months living in central London surrounded by the cacophony of terror alerts and traffic diversions. I was feeling a little uneasy, perhaps more so than in the previous week. However, at least in Birmingham, I thought, things might not be so alarming (not forgetting the bomb alert on Broad Street the weekend after the fatal attacks in London). Essentially, I was looking forward to a few days of psychological calm and serenity. On the train, I switched the radio on to a phone-in programme where listeners expressed their worries about the escalating situation. I observed other passengers. But I still, somehow, felt self-conscious and I wasn't quite sure why. Something was definitely different. And then, to my surprise, the news reported that West Midlands police had raided a house in the Small Heath area of Birmingham early that morning, shooting a suspect with a Taser stun gun. So much for calm and serenity in Birmingham, I thought to myself. A listener called in to say that he was uncomfortable about travelling in train carriages with Asian people. I feel the same, I thought. Was it through total irrationality that I looked around to see the racial mix of the carriage in which I was sitting? So I scanned. It was a decent reflection of our multicultural society: a few Asians (worrying); a few blacks (concerning); but, on the whole, it was predominantly white (reassuring). A couple of young Asian girls sat a few rows in front of me listening to their headphones, a burly black man wearing a pinstriped business suit sat reading the Times and an Asian couple were talking, it seemed, a bit loudly. We got to Milton Keynes, and out of the corners of my eyes, I spotted an Asian man with a beard boarding the train. He had an infant with him, which reassured me. As he sat down I examined what luggage he had and, perhaps through paranoia, I tried to imagine what he might be carrying inside. And still I felt self-conscious. At New Street Station, I got off and made my way out. But as soon as I came off the platform I saw that the place was almost as packed with police officers as it was with passengers - especially at the ticket barriers, where rail staff were standing with armed police. I could see one or two young Asian men being questioned at one side of the barrier. They looked Muslim, bearded and wearing the traditional shalwar-kameez. As I approached the exit, I was asked to produce my ticket. Then the police officer standing next to the rail guard asked me where I had come from. And then he enquired as to what was in my rucksack. And it suddenly occurred to me that that was the reason why I had been feeling uncomfortable - the rucksack! People were linking me, an Asian, with the recent terrorists carrying rucksacks with detonators. Good God, I thought, I must have been the one who looked the most suspicious in the carriage. And it never occurred to me. In fact, for a while, subconsciously, I had even put it to the back of my mind that I was Asian. The recent furore and paranoia about threats, real as they are, had almost robbed my sense of who I am. It just didn't click. So I opened the bag for him to examine; a few text books, a couple of T-shirts, a personal stereo and a notebook. He thanked me and I moved off towards the taxi rank. As I looked back I saw armed officers with sniffer dogs and railway guards questioning mainly young Asian men about the validity of their journey and their identification. And I know it might seem naive to say this, but I couldn't help likening that scene with something from Nazi Germany, where the police stood at barriers checking people's documents.
