Lleyton Hewitt has finally given way and allowed the Tiger into the lair. OK actually Centre Court. But not before he battled through to beat Carlos Moya 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6(7-3). Hewitt the No7 seed was cruising after winning the opening two sets but ninth seed Moya produced some thumping serves to delay Tim Henman's match with Mark Philippoussis as he took the Australian to a fourth set. The strain was beginning to show on Hewitt, who reached match point in the tenth game of the fourth set but reacted angrily when he netted a forehand, slamming his racket into the ground in disgust. Having vented his anger Hewitt gathered his composure and proved too strong for the Spaniard in the tie-break. Hewitt's win has earned him a enticing quarter-final encounter against world No1 Roger Federer. Top seed and reigning champion, Roger Federer displayed all the attributes of the champion he is by beating the plucky Croatian, Ivo Karlovic in straight sets. It was not plain sailing for the world No1 but he produced the big shots when required to win 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5), and secure his place in the last eight. The unseeded Karlovic showed some semblence of fight by pushing Federer to tie-breaks in the final two sets. Federer will now face either Lleyton Hewitt or Carlos Moya in the quarter-final. Hewitt leads two sets to one, with the fourth set going with serve on Centre Court. The first men's single match to reach a conclusion today has seen the tenth seed Sebastien Grosjean, of France, defeat the American, No27 seed Robby Ginepri 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) in the fourth-round. The French number one who beat Tim Henman in the quarter-finals 12 months ago before bowing out against Mark Philippoussis Grosjean will fancy his chances of reaching the semi-finals, for in his next match he will take on a player who is this summer making his first appearance at SW19 - either Florian Mayer, 20, of Germany or Joachim Johansson, a 21-year-old Swede. Fourth round results: (10) Sebastien Grosjean (Fra) bt (27) Robby Ginepri (USA) 6-2, 6-2, 7-6(7-4) (1) Roger Federer (Swi) bt Ivo Karlovic (Cro) 6-3, 7-6(7-3), 7-6(7-5) Mario Ancic (Cro) bt Xavier Malisse (Bel) 7-5 3-1 retired (12) Sjeng Schalken (Ned) bt (30) Vincent Spadea (USA) 6-2, 7-5, 3-6, 6-2 (7) Lleyton Hewitt (Aus) bt (9) Carlos Moya (Spa) 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6(7-3)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
