It\u2019s a powerful, unobvious and rather magnificent conclusion to a spectacular set. The band share a group hug \u2013 and he\u2019s off. That was the first and last time I ever saw Bowie play live and I wish it had been more. Thanks very much for watching this show along with me, and for adding your thoughts. Hopefully we\u2019ll have a real Glastonbury to liveblog next year. Goodnight. Emily Eavis tweets that this was one of her all-time favourite Glastonbury shows: And in an ineffably Bowie move, his final song is I\u2019m Afraid of Americans \u2013 whose title certainly feels prescient at the moment \u2013 from Earthling. He\u2019s enjoying himself so much that he\u2019s now playing air guitar to Slick\u2019s solo. Steam literally seems to be coming off the audience as Bowie says: \u201cWe made it. What a wonderful evening. Please be safe. We really love you a lot.\u201d Bowie has lit a cigarette and is leading the band in a version of Let\u2019s Dance, which started out in a low-key jazz style and has locked into the irresistible strut that made it one of Bowie\u2019s few UK No 1s. Nick Honeywell kindly emails to say: The more I watch this, the more I find myself thinking this must be the same year that Nine Inch Nails played Glastonbury. I remember being distraught when after all of maybe two songs, one of which was (to borrow a phrase from the Bowie coverage) a magnificently sleazy Reptile, the TV footage cut away from their set and never went back. I\u2019d love to see their full and uninterrupted set, too. And speaking of uninterrupted, I\u2019m so pleased that the gap between the main set and the encore was left there. Much better than cutting away to fill the time with inane witterings from random presenters. Having played so many of his anthems, Bowie performs the most anthemic (albeit ironically so) of the lot: \u201cHeroes\u201d. Beginning in a minimal, tightly wound style it cracks open in spectacular style with Earl Slick\u2019s wailing guitar and a raw, unabashedly passionate vocal from Bowie. It\u2019s an incredible moment in a show packed full of them. Enjoying this view from the crowd which a fan posted on Twitter. And after a quick change of jacket (I think) we\u2019re straight back into it with a prowling version of Ziggy Stardust, Bowie\u2019s meta exploration of rock stardom that turned him into a rock star. And that was the end of the main part of the set. For me, watching it tonight just affirmed Bowie\u2019s brilliance all over again. Now it\u2019s a pounding, high-drama take on another hit \u2013 Under Pressure, with Gail Ann Dorsey singing the Freddie Mercury part. Drummer Sterling Campbell is battering his kit into the middle of next week. Every song so far has been performed with incredible focus and intensity \u2013 something that\u2019s even more apparent from seeing it sober from my sofa, rather than half drunk from halfway across a muddy field as I did in 2000. Despite the more challenging material, no one is going to the bar. At this point Bowie has the audience eating out of his hand. \u201cI\u2019m really hot and sweaty, I wore a stupid jacket and I\u2019m too vain to take it off,\u201d Bowie informs the audience, who respond with chants of \u201cOff! Off!\u201d And after a run of classics, he piles into Hallo Spaceboy \u2013 the original tense, industrial album version, not the Pet Shop Boys remix/duet that was a single. Bowie\u2019s enjoying himself so much he just declaimed: \u201cI feel lurved in this room\u201d, stuck out his tongue and launched into Starman. The band are well and truly in the zone, Gail Ann Dorsey looks imperious and Bowie is having the time of his life. Meanwhile, the audience is a pit of sweaty, joyous humanity of the kind I would really love to jump in right now. Emm Gryner was in Bowie\u2019s band that night and has tweeted this: So the sound of a train speeding across the stage means it\u2019s time for one of Bowie\u2019s very greatest songs: the epic Station to Station, an art rock death march which turns into a full-on disco number and contains one of his iconic lyrics: \u201cThe return of the thin white duke, throwing darts in lovers\u2019 eyes.\u201d Needless to say, Bowie\u2019s set was included in our 50 greatest moments, which we published on Friday. A perceptive thought on the way this show was filmed compared to the way Glastonbury is now ... Nirvana\u2019s spectral cover version brought The Man Who Sold the World back into Bowie\u2019s set in the 90s, and it\u2019s fantastic to hear it here \u2013 so mysterious, so addictive, so quintessentially Bowie. Wow, I had forgotten that he played All the Young Dudes. Maybe I had passed out from sheer delight at this point. I always think that Camille Paglia\u2019s description of this song as \u201cominously elegiac\u201d really nailed it. To her it was an anthem to the gay men she knew who died of Aids just a few years after the gay liberation movements of the 70s, and since reading this that\u2019s also what it means to me. This show really does sound great \u2013 so good that it\u2019s amazing we\u2019re only seeing it again in full now. This version of Fame is so sleazy the audience would have needed a wash afterwards ... even if they weren\u2019t already marinating (like me) in three days of accumulated filth. Bowie\u2019s awesome bassist Gail Ann Dorsey\u2019s long dress and sandals combo is also cooler than cool. It\u2019s Golden Years, the third song from Station to Station he\u2019s played so far. That\u2019s half the album. Not that I\u2019m complaining \u2013 I picked it as my favourite album for a series our music desk did a few years ago. Bowie takes an abrupt left-turn into his drum\u2019n\u2019bass-inflected 1997 single Little Wonder. People took the piss out of this at the time as bandwagon-jumping, but I think it\u2019s worn pretty well. This is a very apposite point from below the line: Half the audience \u2013 now realising that this is basically the setlist of dreams \u2013 is jumping up and down and ecstatically roaring along to one of Bowie\u2019s finest riffs and his 1974 kiss-off to the glam era. Watching this of course underlines how much Bowie, who died in 2016, days after the release of his album Blackstar, is missed. Hilary emails me to say: \u201cHe can\u2019t set a foot wrong for me! So stylish, such great songs. So missed.\u201d By this point in 2000, the BBC broadcast had switched to something else, meaning that viewers were deprived of a set that\u2019s just getting more pleasurable with every song. This is an effortlessly spacey, sexy Ashes to Ashes. Now Bowie is telling us about his first Glastonbury appearance, where he hit the stage at dawn. \u201cThis Dutch girl jumped up with me and started singing Oh! You Pretty Things with me. You\u2019re not here tonight, are you dear? Please don\u2019t come up.\u201d Corrected! They are not lighters ... Bowie leaps into the middle of the 80s and plays the great, and now somewhat overlooked, single Absolute Beginners. \u201cI\u2019m very fearful tonight, as I was struck down with laryngitis, so if any of you know the words, for gawd\u2019s sake sing them to me \u2013 I\u2019m counting on you.\u201d Well, that\u2019s one way to introduce Life on Mars? which is giving me goosebumps all over again. The fancy frock-coat has come off! Revealing another frock-coat underneath. He must have been bloody boiling up there. A few people below the line were also at this show ... Bowie introduces his longterm guitarist Earl Slick before they tear into the malevolently funk of Stay from Station to Station, recorded right at the peak (or maybe depths) of Bowie\u2019s LA cocaine period. \u201cGlastonbury, you\u2019ve got a very, very lucky face, all of you!\u201d And Bowie plays Changes, which he notes he also played the only other time he performed at Glastonbury, in 1971. He\u2019s gone full London in his accent, and the crowd are jumping up and down in what is already a pretty ecstatic communal moment. You can tell he knows it\u2019s going well, too. Wild is the Wind having wrongfooted the audience, Bowie kicks things up a notch with China Girl, which he wrote with (and for) Iggy Pop and then did himself on the Let\u2019s Dance album. The lyrics \u2013 \u201cVisions of swastikas in my head, and plans for everyone!\u201d \u2013 are still intriguingly twisted, even though the music represented Bowie\u2019s early-80s lunge for the mainstream. It\u2019s a bold and typically Bowie move to start with the stately Wild Is the Wind, the final track on his incredible 1976 album Station to Station, and perhaps the opposite of the high-octane opening the audience might have expected. Nonetheless, it\u2019s intense, and his voice swoops through the challenging melody \u2013 first recorded by Johnny Mathis and written by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington for the 1957 film of the same name. Bowie with slightly lockdown hair ... certainly the longest it had been since the early 70s. You\u2019ll note the lack of flags and incredible preponderance of lighters in the audience. That was how we expressed our appreciation in the pre-smartphone era. And, after a jazz version of Greensleeves as intro music, here he comes ... While Blur are on some context about Bowie\u2019s standing at the time. After Tin Machine and Black Tie White Noise, he\u2019d put out three experimental albums \u2013 Outside, which was so abrasive I used to play it at closing time in the record shop I worked into get customers to leave; Earthling, which was drum\u2019n\u2019bass-influenced; and then Hours, which was a gentler, if still experimental experience. Hours didn\u2019t even get into the Top 40 in the US (though it reached the top 10 in the UK), and Bowie\u2019s Outside tour had been an uncompromising, Nine Inch Nails-influenced show studded with very few hits. So Bowie wasn\u2019t universally admired \u2013 at least in the incarnation he inhabited at the turn of the millennium. This show definitely marked some kind of reconciliation with his past. Even his hair and clothes expressed it. As Cousins writes: At just after 10pm, Bowie appeared on a backstage camera, looking nervous but determined. Moments later, he was on stage, sporting a three-quarter-length Alexander McQueen frock coat, wonderfully wide Oxford bags and long hair swept to the side \u00e0 la Veronica Lake. Where had I seen this outfit before? It struck me there and then, that Bowie was referencing his own performance at this very same spot almost 30 years earlier, and that he looked just as groundbreakingly beautiful and \u201cgay\u201d now as he did back then. For all his reputation as one of rock\u2019s great shapeshifters, Bowie had decided to headline Glastonbury as \u2026 himself! If you want to talk to me direct about this show, you can tweet me @alexneedham74 or email alex.needham@theguardian.com ... In Ben Beaumont-Thomas\u2019s piece from Friday about the 50 greatest Glastonbury moments, Michael Eavis lifted the lid on how this set came about. \u201cBowie\u2019s agent, John Giddings, phoned me and said David wanted to play,\u201d Michael says. \u201cSo I said: \u2018What\u2019s he doing now, can we listen to the stuff he\u2019s playing?\u2019 He was doing a show in Manchester Arena, so I took the kids up. We walked into the box in the arena, and people started cheering below, and I thought: \u2018My God, how do they know who we are?\u2019 Turns out Eric Cantona was just behind me. I didn\u2019t really like the show \u2013 it was a very experimental stage in his life and he was all over the place. We didn\u2019t know a single song. I thought: \u2018What\u2019s the point of going with this?\u2019 I phoned John back and said: \u2018Can\u2019t he play some songs we know?\u2019 So he said: \u2018We\u2019ll do another show in London for you, then, of all his hits.\u2019 And we loved it \u2013 it was so good. I told John I could afford \u00a390,000. John said: \u2018Is that all? How are we going to tell David?\u2019 Well, that\u2019s your job, John. And it was a done deal. The whole crowd went crazy on it \u2013 it was a wonderful show.\u201d It\u2019s June 2020 and we\u2019re not at Glastonbury thanks to the pandemic. But we can still watch sets from previous years thanks to the BBC, which has been filming the festival since 1997 (Channel 4 broadcasted it for the three years before that). The BBC has chosen David Bowie\u2019s 2000 Glastonbury show to headline Sunday night. It\u2019s the first time the two-hour set has been broadcast in full. Back in 2000, Bowie refused to allow the BBC to broadcast more than the first four songs and an encore. As the former BBC head of music Mark Cooper wrote a couple of year ago, in a piece about the night for the Guardian, he had to stop broadcasting the show just after Bowie did Life on Mars?, and cut instead to Jamie Theakston sitting by a campfire backstage. To be fair to Bowie, back then the live broadcast of Glastonbury wasn\u2019t quite the amazingly recorded, glorious-sounding beast it is now. In 2000, you\u2019d go home raving about a set you\u2019d watched in the fields of Avalon, only for your friends to retort: \u201cWell we saw it on the telly and it sounded absolutely shit!\u201d Which brings me to my own memories of this show, which concluded my first-ever Glastonbury. I was working as features editor of British style magazine the Face at the time, and we had a staff excursion to the festival. Because we were a monthly, there wasn\u2019t any point in writing about it, or indeed doing any work at all (unlike the other 11 times I\u2019ve been, when I\u2019ve been covering it for NME and, from 2007, the Guardian), so we were free to sample Glastonbury\u2019s many delights. It was a pretty wild weekend. It was the last festival before the impregnable wall went up, and some 250,000 people were estimated to be there \u2013 a huge number of whom had just jumped the fence. The after-hours entertainment was a far cry from the sky-high production values of Shangri-La \u2013 the Face crew spent most of our time sweating it out in the Rizla tent, where DJs like David Holmes played all night \u2013 the highlight of his set came when he played the Sex Pistols\u2019 God Save the Queen followed by Sigue Sigue Sputnik\u2019s Love Missile F1-11. Or you could hang round the wine bar \u2013 a truck dispensing plonk at all hours \u2013 and dance to the music blasting from its stereo. After a thorough investigation of everything Glastonbury had to offer, by the Sunday afternoon I was flat on my back in the dance tent, listening to Kelis cover Smells Like Teen Spirit, and overwhelmed with a feeling of gratitude for this extraordinary coming together of people to listen to music, dance, take a gong bath, drink psychedelic pear cider, meet hippies in the Stone Circle and basically have a holiday from the worries of normal life. And I still had Bowie to come! I can remember what Bowie was wearing, his very entertaining between-song chat, and the very last song, but the details of the set itself have become hazy with the passing of time. Suffice it to say that he did a show stuffed with hits, and that at the time it felt like the perfect end to a weekend of unadulterated bliss. The drive home the following morning was sheer hell, and I\u2019ve rarely felt more ill than I did the subsequent week. But it was worth it. So let\u2019s see whether it\u2019s still as great as I remember it, 20 years on. As for the Guardian\u2019s review of this show \u2026 it was a little scanty. Caroline Sullivan wrote: With the country\u2019s biggest live draws, Oasis and Radiohead, booked elsewhere, it was left to the less sexy Chemical Brothers, Travis, and David Bowie to headline Glastonbury\u2019s 30th anniversary. Less sexy, that is, in terms of whipping up excitement, for however festival friendly Chemicals and company may be, they lack what Travis\u2019s Fran Healy called \u201cthat \u2018wooargh\u2019 thing\u201d. That\u2019s the only mention of Bowie in her piece. Let\u2019s hope he isn\u2019t turning in his grave at the claim that he was less sexy than Radiohead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
