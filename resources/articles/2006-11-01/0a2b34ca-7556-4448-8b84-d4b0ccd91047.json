According to Dr Rosie Cox, author of The Servant Problem: Domestic Employment in a Global Economy (IB Tauris) this surpasses numbers in Victorian times. It's a far cry from the predictions in the Fifties where the households of the future had robotic arms to draw the curtains, feed the dog and mangle the washing. Mess is still cleaned up by people - just not the people that create it. Curiously, however, most homeowners think that, if they only had time for such drudgery, they could do the cleaning far more effectively than their cleaners. I know one woman who changes cleaners every six months. Otherwise they get complacent, apparently, and fail to shine up the cooker hob to her exact specification. In fact domestic workers have few rights, so the idea of them getting complacent is ridiculous. In particular migrant domestic workers are likely to be among the worst paid and most isolated. Research by Kalayaan (www.kalayaan.org.uk) finds that employers frequently hold on to passports and that 75 per cent of its members reported psychological abuse. The cleaning industry is an informal one. Most domestic workers are women, paid cash-in-hand, without any contract or entitlement to holiday or sickness pay, or paying National Insurance contributions. Most also receive a spectacularly bad hourly rate. A report by Queen Mary, University of London, reveals the average earnings for domestic staff in London to be just \u00a35.45 an hour, the equivalent of \u00a310,200 a year. Following a campaign by London Citizens (www.londoncitizens.org.uk), Queen Mary is now the UK's first 'living-wage' university, paying cleaners a minimum where they can make ends meet (the London living wage is \u00a37.05 per hour), rather than the minimum wage (\u00a35.05) where they cannot. Cleaning agencies say they receive most of their requests on a Saturday morning - the number one time for couples to have a major domestic about domestic stuff. That's changing as single male households become the main employers of domestic help. A large chunk of them will no doubt work in the city for firms such as Goldman Sachs, recently highlighted by Justice for Cleaners (www.tgwu.org.uk), which pointed out that while the average male salary in the city is \u00a3100,000 per annum, night cleaners receive \u00a36.20 an hour. In addition, single households, a growing phenomenon, have taken a lot of ethical heat recently: they create 42 per cent more packaging and use 61 per cent more gas per person than an individual in a four-person household. If they grasp at least one ethical point, let's hope it's the need to pay cleaners a living wage. Cleaning up shouldn't be dirt cheap."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
