The Tottenham striker headed in with nine minutes left, giving England their eighth win from nine matches in a group they had long since won. With James Ward-Prowse and Tom Carroll marshalling the midfield, England created numerous chances in Kaunas but profligacy in front of goal threatened to leave Southgate frustrated. Saido Berahino\u2019s early effort was tipped over and Ward-Prowse fired past the post before Nathaniel Chalobah had to clear the danger after Lukas Baranauskas\u2019s bobbling shot beat the England goalkeeper, Jack Butland. After the interval Berahino was again denied and both Nathan Redmond and Tom Ince came close to breaking the deadlock \u2013 the former seeing his effort cleared off the line. But Kane, whose introduction sharpened the visitors\u2019 attack, leapt to meet Ward-Prowse\u2019s cross and crash his header past Tomas Svedkauskas in the Lithuania goal to seal victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
