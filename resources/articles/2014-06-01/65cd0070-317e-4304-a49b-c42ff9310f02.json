(See 4.29am.) Although Ofsted found no evidence of a plot to take over Birmingham schools, Gove played up the seriousness of the revelations to the full, saying it was his duty to keep pupils safe. Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, said reports highlighted Gove's failure to submit schools to proper supervision. You speak of requiring all schools to promote British values - all well and good. Amongst the greatest of British values is an education system which welcomes and integrates migrant communities, builds successful citizens in a multi-cultural society, secures safety and high standards for all, and you are failing to do so. \u2022 The Department for Education has indicated that the schools trust at the centre of the extremism allegations, the Park View educational trust, is set to be taken over. As the Press Association reports, the Education Funding Agency (EFA), which is responsible for academies, said Park View Educational Trust (PVET) which runs three schools in Birmingham, had breached its funding agreement. A separate report following the inspection of Oldknow Academy in Small Heath found it was \"taking on the practices of an Islamic faith school\" and had excluded non-Muslim staff and pupils from an annual trip - paid for with public money - to Saudi Arabia. The EFA has told both trusts to carry out immediate reviews of their governance and safeguarding procedures and make changes to their curriculum, or see their public funding terminated. In strongly-worded letters sent to the trusts following those inspections, the schools minister Lord Nash said he was \"gravely concerned\" at the findings. The trusts are now likely to be taken over by other established education providers, with Gove telling MPs: \"We have already spoken to successful academy providers who are ready to act as sponsors.\" \u2022 Ofsted has said \"a culture of fear and intimidation\" has rapidly developed within a group of schools in Birmingham which are under investigation over allegations of a city-wide takeover plot by Islamist extremists. As Richard Adams reports, Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, said his inspectors found that school governors had \"recently exerted inappropriate influence on policy and the day-to-day running\" of several schools in Birmingham, and castigated the city council for not providing adequate support to staff who tried to resist. \"Although the test and examination results in many of the schools were good or improving, the curriculum has become too narrow and pupils are not being prepared well enough for life in modern Britain,\" Wilshaw said. \u2022 Park View educational trust has strongly rejected Ofsted's findings and said that Gove's actions could lead to Park View pupils being stigmatised. (See 11.19am.) \u2022 Theresa May, the home secretary, has said she did not authorise the release of a confidential letter she wrote to Gove criticising his stance on extremism. However, she would not respond to a suggestion from Yvette Cooper, her Labour shadow, that she deliberately wrote the letter with the intention of getting it leaked when she learnt Gove had criticised her in a briefing to the Times. She refused to deny knowing that it was going to be published (see 3.29pm) and she failed to explain why it was allowed to remain on the Home Office's website for several days. \u2022 Sir Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham council, has said he was \"very reassured\" that Ofsted did not uncovered evidence of any co-ordinated plot or conspiracy to seize control of schools. As the Press Association reports, Bore told journalists in a briefing that it was clear some governors and governing bodies had \"failed in their duties\" to pupils. \u2022 Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools, has said that the Education Secretary had previously been opposed to introducing so-called 'no notice' inspections. Wilshaw told BBC Newsnight: He [Gove] said we need to look at this and we need to listen to what head teachers are saying about needing to be in the school prior to the inspections so that they can have a preliminary dialogue with the inspectors about how the inspection should be be conducted. Thanks for following this evening. We're going to wrap up the blog now.\ufeff Ex-advisors to Michael Gove have hit back at at suggestions by Wilshaw that Gove blocked no notice inspections. Here's a tweet from one of them, Sam Freedman: Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools, has appeared on BBC Newsnight, saying that that the Education Secretary had previously been opposed to introducing so-called 'no notice' inspections. In his statement in the House of Commons earlier today, Gove said: Any school could now be subject to rigorous, on the spot inspections \u2013 with no advance warning and no opportunities to conceal failure. However, Wilshaw painted a rather different picture of how Gove had come to reach this position. He said: It was something that I called for two years ago when I first joined... I called for it and it has been rolled back, but we need to do it now for some schools. Jeremy Paxman asked if the Secretary of State has changed his mind. Wilshaw replied that he believed that he had, and added: He said we need to look at this and we need to listen to what head teachers are saying about needing to be in the school prior to the inspections so that they can have a preliminary dialogue with the inspectors about how the inspection should be be conducted. So we pulled back on that and they have now just a few hours. Paxman: \"On his say so?\" Wilshaw: \"Yes\" Wilshaw also said that he stood by Oftsed's much debated 2012 visit which described the school as \"outstanding,\" adding that the head teacher had subsequently been undermined by the governors there, who Wilshaw said had not understood their role: She didn't want the sort of things that were happening in that school. She did not want somebody with known extremist views to attend assembly. She didn't want a madrasa to be introduced into the personal social and educational programme. She has been steadily underminded to the point where the governors are controlling that school on a day to day basis. Jeremy Paxman asked if this suggests that something is wrong with the system. Wilshaw replied: Where there is great turbulence in staffing and great turbulence of leadership then things can be badly wrong. The lessons of this situation in Birmingham is that you need to keep a really careful eye on schools between the inspections. Wilshaw was asked if there need to be more attention the sort of things on the curriculum at academies. He replied: My view is that there should be much more regulation in what is taught in schools. It's wrong for example that children at key stage three, that's between 11 and 14, shouldn't have music, or drama or art, or physical education, or the creative arts. It's wrong. And yet, it's possible for governors to say: 'we are going to get rid of that. We are going to get rid of music' because it doesn't accord with our beliefs. I am at the end of the spectrum which says that there needs to be more prescription. Lee Donaghy, assistant principal at Park View school, has written a comment piece for the Guardian in which he accuses some politicians and some in the media of making a slur against the school's muslim community. He starts of by recalling his first day at the school, which left him feeling like he had found a second home: After teaching in two challenging London schools, Birmingham's Park View was different: in 2010 the school throbbed to the rhythm of its then school motto: Respect, Opportunity, Achievement. The pupils were exceptionally well behaved and respectful \u2013 an attitude fostered by their Muslim faith \u2013 and keen to take advantage of the opportunities the school provided through trips and extracurricular activities. Exam results were well above the national average, despite a cohort who entered with attainment well below. These ingredients gave me the confidence that this was a place that shared my values and my belief that education was the key for disadvantaged, marginalised young people. You can read that piece in full here. Michael Gove's pledge that schools will promote \"British values\" forms the basis for splashes in tomorrow's Guardian and Times: Michael Gove, the education secretary, has emerged from the controversy over extremism in Birmingham schools with his personal commitment to free schools and academies intact, but with growing questions about the sustainability of the educational architecture he has created since 2010. That's a snatch of some analysis filed by Patrick Wintour, the Guardian's Political Editor, who adds: The Downing Street headline-grabber of requiring schools to promote, as opposed to respect, British values may get the government through a difficult day, but many Conservatives see the whole idea collapsing into a series of judicial reviews or Jesuitical arguments about what Britishness means. However, Patrick also says the facts do not entirely fit Labour's critique: Even though some of the schools were academies, Birmingham's Labour-led council had powers to oversee most of them, and fell down on the job. That includes some Labour councillors who were governors at the relevant schools. Read that piece in full here... What impact has the controversy been having on children at the schools involved? It's a question that the Guardian's Steve Morris has been asking parents at Oldknow Academy in Birmingham. Shabina Bano told him: Fear is being placed in the children and that is the biggest concern that we have. Children are questioning: what is radicalisation?... mum, what are hardline muslims? They are questioning themselves: is it right to be a muslim? is it wrong to be in a school that is 99 percent muslim? Another parent, Naeem Yousef, said: We talk about radicalisation. These are primary school children. What Gove is doing now... if this doesn't lead to radicalisation now then what is? I have a son here at the moment. He does not even know how to spell radicalisation, let alone what it means... but now, slowly, slowly, slowly, I can be asked the very same question: 'what is radicalisation, what is going on here?' How do you explain to you children, very young children that this is what is happening to us. Estelle Morris, the former Education Secretary between 2001 and 2002 under Labour, has said that plans for 'on the spot' inspections are an irrelevance. She has told BBC news that they are the only \"concrete\" proposal contained in Michael Gove's package today, adding: At the moment schools have 48 hours notice of an inspection. I don't think a school could hide what has been going on, if you look at the ofsted reports today for example. However, she said that a real debate needed to be had about social cohesion and how to broaden children's aspirations. The Ofsted report showed that there was a real problem in this regard, she said. The lesson of the Birmingham schools controversy is that state education is in chaos, writes John Harris It may be the most flagrant case to date, but the Birmingham story is just one of many signs of what happens when the education system is open to a huge array of so-called providers: high academic performance takes precedence over all other considerations, and local authorities are condemned to being yesterday's news while the DfE is somehow meant to oversee the resulting chaos. Even if many of the 21 institutions at the centre of the story remain maintained schools, that is actually part of the same story: of local authorities' education departments being hacked down and pushed back until meaningful oversight becomes all but impossible. In that context, note the surreal absurdity of one of Gove's apparent answers to Birmingham's problems: forcing all its schools to become academies, a move indicative of the madness that has seized him and his department. More here A bit of a potential gap opening up here between Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools, and Michael Gove, in relation to on the spot inspections. In his statement in the House of Commons earlier today, Gove said that: Any school could now be subject to rigorous, on the spot inspections \u2013 with no advance warning and no opportunities to conceal failure. Wilshaw has told BBC Newsnight (which is broadcasting an interview with him later) that the Education Secretary had previously been opposed to introducing such inspections and gave a number of reasons for this. Dominic Cummings, Michael Gove's former adviser, has tweeted however: Theresa May and Michael Gove, \"the cabinet ministers who got on their high Trojan horsest were brought down to earth by the bulk of Eric Pickles, writes John Grace in his sketch of today's events in Parliament: David Cameron was taking no chances. Having already ticked off the home secretary and the education secretary for conducting their private feud in public, he sent the bulk of Eric Pickles to separate them on the front bench as they did their two-hour penance on the naughty step answering urgent questions in the Commons on extremism in schools. You don't mess about when Big Eric, aka the Bouncer, is around. Read on here The current system of school accountability is \"confusing and fragmented\", according to the Local Government Association, which has said that councils should have powers to intervene in underperforming schools quickly and without the permission of Whitehall. Councillor David Simmonds, Chair of the LGA\u2019s Children and Young People Board, said: This has been an unsettling time for parents and children and it is vital they are at the forefront of any action taken in response to these investigations. Parents need to know who is accountable for their local school, but under the current system accountability is confusing and fragmented. It is clear that effective oversight of standards and finance in schools across the UK cannot be exercised from Whitehall, and the jumble of regimes risks leaving mums and dads unsure where to go for help when they have concerns. Local authorities know their schools and the communities they serve and strong local oversight by local authorities is needed to spot warning signs where schools are beginning to cause concern and tackle problems before it is too late. Councils need powers to intervene in all under performing schools quickly and effectively without the need to ask permission from Whitehall. Michael Crick of Channel 4 News had an interesting encounter outside the Department for Education, bumping into none other than Dominic Cummings, Michael Gove's former adviser. While Cummings officially quit as Gove's paid adviser last year it, Crick suggested that he still seems to be welcome at the department. \"I think Michael's explained it all very well in House of Commons,\" said Cummings, who has been commenting about the Trojan horse issue, and Gove's row with Theresa May, on Twitter this morning. A spirited, if rushed, little debate on Channel 4 News in the last hour bringing together former Birmingham City councillor Salma Yaqoob, Shaista Gohir of the Muslim Women's Network, parents from the Oldknow Academy Parents Association and the local MP, Khalid Mahmoud. Gohir made the point that many people feld that they were expected to be in \"two camps\" - either entirely in support of the position taken by Michael Gove or else lined up in opposition to him. Borrowing language from debate surrounding the Iraq War, Yaqoob said that much of the controversy had been sparked by a \"dodgy dossier\". Khalid Mahmoud, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, reiterated that there had been a\"real serious plot\", adding: If you connect the main people who were going in terms of governance.. if you look at governors and key people involved, then you can see that they were united in one aim. The acting principal of an academy which was found by the Education Funding Agency (EFA) to have been \"taking on the practices of an Islamic faith school\" has hit back. The acting principal of Oldknow Academy, Jahangir Akbar, said: I feel that it's a political witch-hunt. There is no extremism here; our children are safe. It is unfair that these allegations are being made against us. All my middle managers are female; the leadership team has female members. The majority of the staff are non Muslim. Steven Morris reports: Akbar showed the Guardian emails and other documents that he said give the lie to these claims. One parent had expressed the concern that Tombola and raffles were un-Islamic, which had prompted a debate on the issue. They had been cancelled \u201cto be on the safe side\u201d. He said no Christmas special assembly had been organised \u2013 so it could not have been cancelled. But Akbar said a string of Christmas events, ranging from making decorations to making festive cards were organised. Akbar said because of Saudi's strict laws regarding visitors it had not been possible to open the trip to all pupils and staff. On another claim \u2013 that important decisions were being made by a small group of governors trying to promote a \u201cnarrow faith-based ideology in a non-faith academy\u201d, Akbar said the allegation was not backed up by evidence. The Ofsted report also highlighted that a madrasa had been established at the school. Akbar said this was correct \u2013 but it had been closed two and a half years ago. It had been set up because of \u201csafeguarding\u201d concerns about pupils attending madrasas away from the school because of the possibility that they might be punished physically. \u201cI don't know why that historic incident is being raised now,\u201d he said. Another criticism in the report is that Birmingham City Mission had not been invited back to deliver Christian acts of worship. But Akbar showed the Guardian e-mails that made it clear the school had actively sought organisations that would bring both Christian and Jewish ideas to the school.

Pledging to draw up action plans for individual schools inspected during Ofsted's inquiries, and to allocate link officers to each school, the leader of the Labour-run council said: We are reassured that Ofsted has presented no evidence of a plot or conspiracy, but there have been unacceptable actions by a few people in a few schools. It's also clear that there are areas in which the city council's own support needs to be reviewed and strengthened. That's all from me for today. But my colleague Ben Quinn will taking over the blog and updating it into the evening. Thanks for the comments. Earlier I said it was not very clear what \"promoting British values\" actually meant in practice. |The Department for Education has now sent out some briefing. It says it wants to \"create and enforce a clear and rigorous expectation on all schools to promote the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs.\". It also says that independent schools, academies and free schools are already required to respect British values. Here is an extract from the DfE's guidance giving more details of what this means. This is a new part of the standard. It has some aspects in common with other parts, particularly those relating to respect for the law and mutual tolerance, while seeking to place those in an overall context of British society based on parliamentary democracy and liberty for the individual within a legal framework. 13. The list below describes the kinds of understanding and knowledge that can be expected in pupils as a result of schools meeting this part of the standard. \u2022 An understanding as to how citizens can influence decision-making through the democratic process; \u2022 An understanding that participation in elections by those opposed to democracy should be allowed by law, but the success of such candidates is undesirable for the well-being of society if it would lead to the end of democracy; \u2022 An appreciation that living under the rule of law protects individual citizens and is essential for their well-being and safety; \u2022 An understanding that bodies such as the police and the army can be held to account to the people, through the democratic organs of government; \u2022 An understanding that the freedom to hold other faiths and beliefs is protected in law, and an acceptance that other people having different faiths or beliefs to oneself (or having none) should not be the cause of prejudicial or discriminatory behaviour; \u2022 Some understanding of the problems of identifying and combatting discrimination (based on protected characteristics as listed in the Equality Act 2010). Attempts to promote systems that undermine the principles comprising these fundamental British values would be inconsistent with this part of the standard. 14. There are many different actions that schools can take to meet this part of the standard, such as: \u2022 Include in suitable parts of the curriculum, as appropriate for the age of pupils, material on the strengths, advantages and disadvantages of democracy, and how democracy works in Britain, in contrast to other forms of government in other countries; \u2022 Ensure that all pupils within the school have a voice that is listened to, for example by having democratic processes such as a school council whose members are voted for by the pupils; \u2022 Organise visits to local councils, Parliament and places of worship of other faiths, and encourage contacts with those in political or local office; \u2022 Use opportunities such as general or local elections to hold mock elections whereby pupils can learn how to argue and defend points of view; \u2022 Use teaching resources from a wide variety of sources to help pupils understand a range of faiths, and beliefs such as atheism and humanism. Here's a statement from Chris Keates, the general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, on the Birmingham investigation. Amidst the feeding frenzy of leaked reports, numerous investigations, politicians taking chunks out of each other and months of rumour and speculation, what has been forgotten is that in the middle of all this are teachers trying their best to support children and young people, many of whom are taking critical exams. The NASUWT will be studying the Ofsted reports in detail. Our priority is to support our members who are under great pressure and stress. Whatever the findings of those reports, what is absolutely clear is that they must not be allowed to make schools carry the can for what are the clear failures of Ofsted and government. Ofsted dropped the ball when it stopped inspecting how schools tackle race equality and when it was no longer required to inspect how schools meet their duty with regard to community cohesion. The government has fragmented the school system, removed local democratic accountability and has conferred excessive school autonomy onto a school governance system that it is widely accepted is not fit for purpose. It is this which needs to be accepted and addressed. It is unacceptable for children and staff to continue to pay the price and for local communities to be scapegoated and pilloried. The BBC's Mark Easton has written a very good blog about the \"Trojan horse\" affair. Here's his conclusion. The evidence of Islamist extremism in Birmingham schools appears thin. The schools themselves say Ofsted has made \"absolutely no suggestion, nor did they find any evidence, that Park View schools either promote or tolerate extremism or radicalisation\". What there may well have been is an attempt by some conservative Muslims to encourage an ethos within Birmingham schools that is true to their religious tradition. But is that very different from Michael Gove's encouragement of parents in Catholic academies to be true to their religious tradition? If, like 629 other state-funded English secondaries, Park View had been allowed to become a faith school, then one presumes the Islamic ethos would no longer be regarded as a threat to the welfare of the pupils. Conservative Muslims would be no different from conservative Catholics looking to escape from moral and cultural relativism. The Muslim Council of Britain has put out a statement saying the Ofsted investigation into Birmingham schools could make the situation worse, by propagating \"the slur of extremism\". Here's an extract. These incendiary claims have not been proven, and there is widespread fear that the subsequent investigations have only deepened the problem, not resolved it at all. No extremism has been found, but the slur of extremism remains ... We understand that many of these schools are being downgraded because they are \u2018not doing enough to tackle extremism\u2019. Yet, extremism will not be confronted if Muslims, and their religious practices are considered as, at best, contrary to the values of this country, and at worst, seen as \u2018the swamp\u2019 that feeds extremism. When, in supporting the Education Secretary, former Communities Secretary Hazel Blears says that a person going to the mosque five-times-a-day is a sign of extremism (Radio 5 Live, 5 June), then we have a problem. Over the last few months, the Muslim community has been subjected to ridiculous accusations of extremism. Yet Muslims, part and parcel of British society, have condemned terrorism in the strongest terms, and the extremism that lead people to commit such acts. As we have stated time and again, the causes of terrorism are complex. But there is scant evidence that the education system or the Muslim community are the reasons for why people turn to terrorism. In the Commons Michael Gove is still taking questions on his statement. Liam Byrne, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill and a shadow education minister, tried to ask a question earlier but got cut off by the speaker, John Bercow, because he was being so long-winded. Byrne has now posted them on his website. And he is putting them to Gove in a letter. There are four questions. Here is one of them. Four out of the six schools placed in special measures are academies. They report to you. One school detailed in the Ofsted report, was listed with by my count, some 15 breaches of funding agreement with you. Given these academies reported to you, I have to ask, how did you let this happen? Here are the main points from Michael Gove's statement \u2022 Gove said that he would consult on requiring all schools to promote British values. We already require independent schools, academies and free schools to respect British values. Now we will consult on strengthening this standard further, so that all schools actively promote British values. And I will ask Ofsted to enforce an equivalent standard on maintained schools through changes to the Ofsted framework. This sounds like a terrific headline, but as yet it is not clear what, in practice, this will mean. It could be anything from \"nothing much\" to endless \"culture war\" battles, particularly covering diversity and inclusion. (And what are British values anyway? At the very least, Gove is going to keep the op-ed pages in business for weeks and years go come.) \u2022 Gove suggested that children in Birmingham were not being kept safe. Keeping our children safe - and ensuring our schools prepare them for life in modern Britain - could not be more important \u2013 it is my central mission. Allegations made in what has become known as the Trojan Horse letter suggested children were not being kept safe in Birmingham schools. This seems a mild exaggeration. The Ofsted letter talks about Birmingham council failing to \"support a number of schools in their efforts to keep pupils safe from the potential risks of radicalisation and extremism\". Keeping pupils safe from radicalisation and extremism is not quite the same as keeping them safe. \u2022 He summarised the evidence showing Islamist extremists had undue influence in some Birmingham schools. He referred to evidence not just in the Ofsted reports, but in reports form the Education Funding Agency. (See 4.02pm.) At one secular primary school, terms such as \u201cwhite prostitute\u201d unsuitable for primary children\u2019s ears, were used in Friday assemblies run exclusively by Muslim staff. The school organised visits to Saudi Arabia open only to Muslim pupils. Senior leaders told Inspectors that a madrassah had been established and been paid for from the school\u2019s budget. Ofsted concluded the school was \u201cnot adequately ensuring that pupils have opportunities to learn about faith in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony between different cultures\u201d. At one secular secondary school, staff told officials the call to prayer was broadcast over the playground using loud speakers. Officials observed lessons had been narrowed to comply with conservative Islamic teachings - in biology, students were told \u201cevolution is not what we believe\u201d. The school invited the preacher Sheikh Shady al-Suleiman to speak despite the fact that he is reported to have said \u201cGive victory to Muslims in Afghanistan\u2026 Give victory to all the Mujahideen all over the world. Oh Allah, prepare us for the jihad.\u201d Ofsted concluded that \u201cgovernors have failed to ensure that safeguarding requirements and other statutory duties are met\u201d. At another secular secondary school inspectors described \u201ca state of crisis\u201d with governors reportedly using school funds to pay private investigators to read the emails of senior leaders, and a lack of action to protect students from extremism. At a third secular secondary school, Ofsted found students are \u201cvulnerable to the risk of marginalisation from wider British society and the associated risks which could include radicalisation\u201d. And at a secular primary Ofsted found, that \u201cpupils have limited knowledge of religious beliefs other than Islam\u201d, and \u201csubjects such as art and music have been removed - at the insistence of the governing body\u201d. Inspectors concluded that the school \u201cdoes not adequately prepare students for life in modern Britain\u201d. \u2022 He confirmed that he wanted Ofsted to be able to conduct inspections with no notice. \u2022 He said he had asked the permanent secretary at the Department for Education to investigate whether his department ignored warnings about Birmingham, both under Gove and under the previous Labour government. \u2022 He said he had asked Birmingham council to review its handling of this matter and to take draw up \"an action plan to tackle extremism and keep children safe\". \u2022 He said that action would be taken to deal with the schools found to be inadequate. Academies will receive letters saying I am minded to terminate funding agreements. Local authority schools are having governors replaced. We have already spoken to successful academy providers who are ready to act as sponsors. When an academy gets a letter saying its funding arrangements are due to be terminated, that means the department is poised to impose new management. \u2022 He said the Association of Muslim Schools UK was being asked to satisfy the government is was doing enough to protect children from extremism. Some of the governors investigated by Ofsted are active in the association, he said. The association has statutory responsibilities in relation to state Muslim faith schools, he said. If it could not provide \"robust\" assurances, \"appropriate steps\" could be taken. That sounded like a hint it could lose its statutory role. \u2022 He said the National College for Teaching and Leadership would be asked to strengthen its rules so that \"it is explicit that a teacher inviting an extremist speaker into a school can be banned from the profession\". And this is how Gove ended his statement. As education secretary, I am taking decisive action to make sure those children are protected. Schools that are proven to have failed will be taken over, put under new leadership and taken in a fresh new direction. Any school could now be subject to rigorous, on the spot inspections \u2013 with no advance warning and no opportunities to conceal failure. And we will put the promotion of British values at the heart of what every school has to deliver for children. What we have found was unacceptable. And we will put it right. In his opening statement Michael Gove referred to reports into Birmingham schools published today by the Education Funding Agency (the body that oversees academies), in addition to the Ofsted reports. There are two on the EFA's website. \u2022 Oldknow academy (pdf) \u2022 Park View trust (pdf) Gove is responding to Hunt. He says he is disappointed Hunt did not say whether Labour supported no notice inspections. And Hunt did not say whether he agreed that schools should have to promote British values. As for the meeting in 2010, when the Department for Education was briefed about extremism by a Birmingham head teacher, Gove says he was not at that meeting. And he was not told about it. That is why he has asked the permanent secretary to investigate, he says. he says none of the schools in Birmingham were free schools. Academies are subject to more intensive scrutiny, he says. They are inspected by Ofsted, and by the Education Funding Agency. He says schools already have to teach a balanced curriculum. The issue is enforcement, he says. Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, is replying to Gove. He says the events in Birmingham show an education system \"in disarray\". He says he appreciates the anxiety parents feel. Gove's strategy of trying to control very school from a desk in Whitehall has been shown not to work, he says. Hunt says we need to be clearer about what modern education involves. He says, having read the Ofsted report, he shares Gove's concerns. There were invitations to unsuitable speakers, unsuitable sex education, gender segregation and staff intimidation, he says. At least four investigations into Birmingham schools have been taking place. And Gove has today announced another. But Gove is trying to evade responsibility. Had he taken control, these problems would have been addressed earlier. The Department for Education was told about these problems in 2010. He mentions a specific presentation to the DfE. Which ministers were present? And he quotes from May's letter to Gove. Is it true that the Department for Education was warned in 2010? If so, why did nobody act? The Park View trust had an application to set up a free school turned down on security grounds in 2013, he says. But it was also allowed to take over Golden Hillocks school. Gove's policy has been one of atomisation, he says. Birmingham has shown this model is bust. Hunt says we need local systems of accountability. And there needs to be an inspection system that looks beyond \"exam factory\" criteria. Ofsted inspections should include the need for a broad and balanced curriculum, with a focus on character. And Labour believe that should include compulsory sex education, he says. Gove says no government has done more to tackle extremism than this one under Theresa May. A unit was set up to counter extremism in public services. Ofsted inspectors are trained to combat extremism, he says. But more needs to be done. First, action will be taken in schools affected. Academies will be told they could lose funding. Governors will be replaced. Ofsted will consider the case for no-notice inspections. The DfE will consider how Ofsted can better insist on all schools teaching a balance curriculum. Gove says he has spoken to the leader of Birmingham council about how to address this. Schools will be told to actively promote British values. The National College of Teaching and Leadership will make it clear that teachers inviting extremists into schools can be banned from the teaching profession. The conclusions of these reports are clear, he says. Things happened that should not have happened. Children were exposed to things they should not have been exposed to. Michael Gove says keeping children safe is his key mission. Allegations made in Birmingham suggest children were not kept safe. He summarises the Ofsted findings. (See 2.11pm.) At one secular school, terms such as \"white prositute\" were used in Friday assembly by Muslim staff. Trips to Saudi Arabia for Muslim pupils were arranged. At a secular secondary school, the call to prayer was broadcast over the school's speakers in the playgrounds. Pupils were taught that evolution was not what they believed. An extremist speaker visited. At another staff's emails were monitored. And at a secular primary, Ofsted found that pupils had limited knowledge of religions other than Islam. Subjects like art were excluded. These findings require a robust, but considered response. They should not led to an attack on Islam, a great faith that inspires countless acts of generosity. Gove says he has asked Birmingham council to consider its handling of this. And he has asked the Department for Education responded to warnings about this, both under Gove and before. That's it. We are now getting Michael Gove's statement. Labour's Jon Ashworth asks if May decided at the start of the cabinet secretary's not to take down her letter to Gove from the website. May just repeats the answer she has given many times already about the cabinet secretary launching an investigation. Labour's Nic Dakin asks if May knew that Fiona Cunningham was going to release the letter to May. May could have just said: \"No.\" But she did not. She just said she had answered many questions on this. And she says it is \"a bit rich\" to be asked so many questions about special advisers from the party of Damian McBride. \u2022 May refuses to deny knowing that Fiona Cunningham was going to publish her private letter to Michael Gove. Labour's Wayne David asks if May authorised the release of her letter to Gove to the media. May says she has answered that already. She did not authorise the release of the letter. Lee Donaghy, the Park View assistant principal who gave a rather moving statement this morning attacking Ofsted (see 10.59am) is now having a go at my Guardian colleague, Zoe Williams. Labour's Huw Irranca-Davies asks if Home Office special advisers have access to the website. May says she has addressed the issues underlying this question already. Michael Ellis, a Conservative, says Labour think May should be \"micro-managing\" the Home Office website. The Spectator's James Forsyth thinks Labour is not coordinating its attack on May very well. Three Labour MPs have followed up on the \"why did it take three days to take down the letter\" question, and May looked more and more uncomfortable each time. But Labour MPs are not following up on the question about why May only wrote the letter after she knew Gove had briefed against her. (See 2.41pm and 2.59pm.) Turning away from the Commons for a moment, my colleague Steven Morris has sent me this, from outside Oldknow academy. (See 1.55pm.) In their smart blazers and ties, the pupils of Oldknow Academy were getting on with lessons as usual. At the school gates, parents were worried that the shadow of the Trojan Horse row would cast a shadow over the rest of their lives. \"If you google Oldknow you see Trojan Horse and extremist plots,\" said Naeem Yousef. \"That's the problem. We're worried it's going to blight the rest of their lives. Colleges and employers will look at all this and wonder about our children.\" Yousef, who has a nine-year-old son at Oldknow, said he had never heard that the children were segregated, indoctrinated or undergoing any kind of radicalisation.That's ridiculous,\" he said. \"The boys and girls might try to sit together but that's what goes on everywhere.\" As some children came out of the school and clambered into a bus waiting to take them away on a trip, there was no sign of segregation. Boys and girls walked out - chattering happily - together. Another parent, Shabina Bano, said she took her two daughters out of a private faith school to send them to Oldknow because of its growing reputation locally. \"It's a fantastic school. The results are brilliant.\" In fact she thinks this might be part of the problem. \"Outsiders can't understand how it can have improved so much. They are suspicious; they think something strange must be going on.\" Bano said she was having to explain to her children what terms like radicalisation and extremism meant. \"It's upsetting to have to do that. Children here are being demonised. I think the community has lost trust in the authorities be ause of this. The government is going to have to work hard to win the trust back.\" David Ward, a Lib Dem MP, asks why May used the word \"extremist\" to cover the killing of Lee Rigby and behaviour in Birmingham schools. Would she talk about extremist Catholics, instead of devout Catholics? Or extremist Christians, instead of committed Christians? May says she mentioned Lee Rigby in her opening statement because she was talking about the government's anti-extremist measures. Labour's Nia Griffith says May is using the word \"immediate\" to refer to \"three days\". No wonder people are waiting so long for passports. Can she explain why it took so long to take it down. May repeats the answer she gave to Lucas, without addressing this specific point. Labour's Andrew Gwynne asks why it took three days to remove her letter from the Home Office's website. May repeats the answer she gave to Ian Lucas. (See 3.04pm.) She does not answer the question. Labour's Ian Lucas asks who authorised the placing of her letter on the Home Office's website. May says it was not her. Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, conducted an investigation. His recommendations went to the prime minister. And her special adviser, Fiona Cunningham, resigned on Saturday. Labour's Lyn Brown asks May to confirm that she has only got \u00a31m in her Prevent budget left. May says that Brown is not reading the figures correctly. On Twitter colleagues are pointing to a key question that Theresa May refused to answer. Labour's Dennis Skinner asks why May failed to persuade Gove. Is is because \"the nasty party\" is gearing up for a leadership contest after the election? May says that question should not be dignified with a reply. May says it was Muslim groups who urged the government to separate counter-terrorism work from counter-extremism work. We have now posted Sir Michael Wilshaw's letter about Ofsted's Birmingham findings in full on our website. Keith Vaz, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, says May is in charge of counter-terrorism. No minister has warned the committee about extremism in Birmingham schools. Has May received a reply to the questions she posed in her letter to Gove last Tuesday. May says Gove is about to make a statement about Birmingham. Vaz should wait for that, she says. Labour's David Blunkett says May is at her worst when she tries to patronise. What will May and Gove do to work together to reach out the the Muslim community? May says the government is clear that it needs to reach out and work with people in Muslim communities. MPs can do this too, she says. She says on Friday she was talking to Muslim women from her constituency about how they could play a full part in British society. May is responding to Cooper. She says she has banned foreign hate preachers. Labour did not do this. In fact, one was actually embraced by Labour's mayor of London, Ken Livingstone. May says she has banned more foreign hate preachers than any other home secretary. She says she did not break the ministerial code, as Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, and David Cameron concluded. She says Cooper should withdraw this suggestion. May says it is not true that no action was taken about the letter being on the website. An investigation was launched, she says. May says Cooper misunderstands how the Prevent strategy works. The Home Office sets the strategy. The rest of the government has to deliver it. For the first time, the Department of Education has a dedicated extremism unit, she says. May says in 2011 the government decided to split Prevent. The integration strategy is quite deliberately run out of the Department for Communities, not the Home Office. Labour's approach was damaging, and caused resentment amongst Muslims, she says. She says Alan Johnson, the Labour former home secretary, endorsed this move. What happened in Birmingham is serious, May says. We must confront extremism in all its forms. But, on extremism, Labour would take us backwards, she says. Yvette Cooper says these issues are complex. They require ministers to work together. But, instead of showing leadership, May and Gove chose to \"let rip\" in public. May's letter to Gove has made it harder for ministers to reach agreement. If May did not authorise the publication of that letter, why did she let it stay on the Home Office's website for three days? And why did she write it only when she found out that Gove had criticised her in his comments to the Times? Did she break the ministerial code? Does she stand by her criticisms of Gove? This was \"shambolic for the government\". But it was more serious for everyone else. Theresa May says she takes tackling extremism very seriously. That is why she reformed the Prevent strategy. The Prevent strategy she inherited was flawed. It confused promoting integration with preventing terrorism. Ministers engaged with and lent legitimacy to people with extremist agendas. The new strategy deals with non-violent extremism, as well as violent extremism. And now there is a clear demarcation line between counter-terrorism work, and counter-extremism work. And the government is not working with, or funding organisations that do not promote human rights. On the events of last week, May says she did no authorise the release of her letter. Following the cabinet secretary's investigation, Michael Gove apologised for his comments to the Times, and Fiona Cunningham, her special adviser, resigned. Yvette Cooper asks Theresa May to make a statement on her conduct regarding the government's actions preventing extremism. Theresa May, the home secretary, is about to answer an urgent Commons question about her stance on tackling extremism. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has tabled it. She wants to ask May about her row with Michael Gove. There is more background about the Gove/May feud here. Here are some more extracts from Sir Michael Wilshaw's letter setting out Ofsted's findings. \u2022 Some headteachers, including those with a proud record of raising standards, said that they have been marginalised or forced out of their jobs. As a result, some schools previously judged to be good or outstanding have experienced high levels of staff turbulence, low staff morale and a rapid decline in their overall effectivenes. - \u2022 In several schools, there has been a breakdown in trust between governors and staff, including senior staff. Many staff and some headteachers told Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectors that they were frightened of expressing views contrary to those promoted by governors. Some staff said that they were fearful of losing their jobs or being blocked from promotion if they spoke out against the changes that were being pursued. In one instance, a school leader was so anxious about the consequences of speaking to Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectors that a meeting had to be arranged in a supermarket car park. \u2022 Staff and some headteachers variously described feeling \u2018intimidated\u2019, \u2018undermined\u2019 or \u2018bullied\u2019 by governors, and sometimes by senior staff, into making changes they did not support. Others testified that they have been treated unfairly because of their gender or religious belief. For example, in one school, female members of staff complained to Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectors that they were intimidated by the way some male members of the school community spoke to them. \u2022 In several schools, staff reported that recruitment was neither fair nor transparent. Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectors found specific examples of family members being appointed to unadvertised senior leadership posts and candidates being appointed to senior leadership positions in spite of poor references and contrary to the wishes of the headteacher - Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectors found that governors in some schools have sought to make or have made changes to policies and the curriculum on the basis of their own personal beliefs, irrespective of the school\u2019s stated ethos and values. For example, in one primary school, governors opposed the headteacher\u2019s commitment to mixed-gender swimming lessons. The Chair of Governors in another school, against the wishes of the headteacher, introduced madrasa programmes of study into the personal, health and social education curriculum. \u2022 Not all of the schools that were inspected are in the same position. The evidence suggests three broad categories of school: in some schools, the inappropriate influence of governors is widespread and deep-rooted; in others, there are significant weaknesses in governance, but the level of undue influence exerted by individual governors is less established; in a few schools, leaders have successfully resisted the attempts of governors to change the nature and ethos of their school. Here is the press notice from Ofsted, with links to all 21 reports published today. Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectors carried out inspections of 21 schools in Birmingham between 5 March 2014 and 1 May 2014. All of the schools that were inspected are publicly funded and none is a faith school. All of the schools were inspected under section 8 of the Education Act 2005. Fifteen of these schools were inspected at the request of the Secretary of State. Six were inspected because of Ofsted\u2019s concerns about the effectiveness of safeguarding and leadership and management in these schools. Five schools were judged to be inadequate, after the visits were turned into full section 5 inspection full inspection.

Ofsted has now published the \"advice note\" (pdf) that Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted's chief inspector, has sent to Michael Gove following the inspections. It's an 11-page letter. Here is the summary with the main findings. A culture of fear and intimidation has developed in some of the schools since their previous inspection. Some headteachers, including those with a proud record of raising standards, said that they have been marginalised or forced out of their jobs. As a result, some schools previously judged to be good or outstanding have experienced high levels of staff turbulence, low staff morale and a rapid decline in their overall effectiveness. Some headteachers reported that there has been an organised campaign to target certain schools in Birmingham in order to alter their character and ethos. The evidence shows that governors have recently exerted inappropriate influence on policy and the day-to-day running of several schools in Birmingham. In other schools, leaders have struggled to resist attempts by governing bodies to use their powers to change the school in line with governors\u2019 personal views. Birmingham City Council has failed to support a number of schools in their efforts to keep pupils safe from the potential risks of radicalisation and extremism. It has not dealt adequately with complaints from headteachers about the conduct of governors. Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectors identified breaches of funding agreements in a number of academies. In several of the schools inspected, children are being badly prepared for life in modern Britain. Here is the report into Park View academy (pdf), another of the five schools judged to be inadequate. And here is an extract. The academy\u2019s work to raise students\u2019 awareness of the risks of extremism is inadequate. External speakers have not been vetted properly. For example, those who speak to students as part of a programme of Islamic- themed assemblies. Students are not taught how to use the internet safely. They are not taught sex and relationships education effectively. They are not suitably supported in understanding how to protect themselves from all types of bullying. Equality of opportunity is not promoted well. There are few opportunities for students to learn about different types of beliefs and cultures in the older year groups. Students are not taught citizenship well enough or prepared properly for life in a diverse and multi-cultural society. We are summarising key points from the Ofsted reports here, on this blog. The Ofsted reports are now out. Here is the report into Oldknow academy (pdf). It says the school is going into special measures. Governors do not meet their statutory responsibilities to safeguard pupils because they have not taken steps to protect them from the risks of radicalisation and extremism. A small group of governors is making significant changes to the ethos and culture of the academy without full consultation. They are endeavouring to promote a particular and narrow faith-based ideology in what is a maintained and non-faith academy. Many members of staff are afraid to speak out against the changes taking place in the academy. And here are more details about why the governance is deemed inadequate. Governance is inadequate. Governors are not fulfilling all of the terms and conditions of the academy\u2019s funding agreement. The Determination awarded to the academy in January 2008, exempting the academy from having a daily, broadly Christian act of worship, expired in January 2013 and was not renewed. Currently, the academy has two Islamic faith assemblies each week and additional, optional Friday prayer. Birmingham City Mission has been delivering Christian Acts of Collective Worship at Oldknow, once a term, since 2006. Its recent assembly was cancelled and the Mission\u2019s offer of an alternative date was not taken up. No further visits have been requested. The academy\u2019s Christmas special assembly was also cancelled. During a recent academy fe\u0302te, raffles and tombolas were banned because they are considered un-Islamic. Inspectors found that important decisions are being made by a small number of governors, including the Chair of Governors, rather than by the governing body collectively. Governors, especially the Chair of Governors, exert too much influence in the day-to-day running of the academy. Not all visitors to the academy are recorded on the electronic system. Governors have used the academy\u2019s budget to subsidise a trip to Saudi Arabia for only Muslim staff and pupils. The choice of destination meant that pupils from other faiths were not able to join the trip. Governors who accompany the trip are paid for from the academy budget. Inspectors were told that in 2013 a relative of the academy\u2019s governor joined the trip from Pakistan without the necessary checks having been made. During the inspection senior leaders told Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectors that a madrasa had been established in the academy and had been paid for from the academy\u2019s budget. This was not in operation at the time of the inspection. The governing body holds the academy to account for the achievement of pupils and the quality of teaching. Governors are very aware of teachers\u2019 performance. However, salary rises and promotion are not managed in an open and transparent way. Governors know how the pupil premium funding is spent and how well pupils for whom the academy receives the additional funding are doing. The academy\u2019s website lists a wide range of measures on which the funding is spent. On the World at One Liam Byrne, the shadow education minister and a Birmingham MP, said that Michael Gove would have to explain why he did not intervene earlier in the Birmingham schools. I've taken the quote from PoliticsHome. There are suggestions that both Birmingham city council knew and there are suggestions that Michael Gove knew, and obviously one of the things that we'll be pressing Michael Gove on today is that if the media reports are true, four out of the five schools that are destined for special measures are academies; they report to him, he's in charge, the buck stops on his desk. So we'll be asking Theresa May's question which is: Were officials at the Department of Education warned in 2010, and if so why did nobody act? We frankly want to know who knew what and when, but as Theresa May herself has made clear, there were officials in the Department for Education that were briefed on some of these allegations. And ,as I say, Ofsted passed Park View School, for example, as an outstanding school in January 2012, Michael Gove signed it off not only as an academy, then asked Park View Trust to expand. If today, we learn that he is putting Park View school into special measures, then he will have to account for what action he took, for what monitoring he undertook, and what his relationship was with the school governors, because ultimately the buck stops on his desk. The reference to May's question refers to the final paragraph of the letter May sent to Gove last week which was published on the Home Office's website. Here it is again. The allegations relating to schools in Birmingham raise serious questions about the quality of school governance and oversight arrangements in the maintained sector, not just the supplementary schools that would be signatories to this code of practice. How did it come to pass, for example, that one of the governors at Park View was the chairman of the education committee of the Muslim Council of Britain? Is it true that Birmingham city council was warned about these allegations in 2008? Is it true that the Department for Education was warned in 2010? If so, why did nobody act? I am aware that several investigations are still ongoing and those investigations are yet to conclude. But it is clear to me that we will need to take clear action to improve the quality of staffing and governance if we are to prevent extremism in schools. George Galloway, the Respect MP, says the \"Trojan horse\" affair has become an anti-Muslim witch hunt. The Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim organisation, has accused Michael Gove of a \"deliberate attempt to whip up hatred against Muslims\". This is from its chief executive, Mohammed Shafiq. The Trojan horse campaign waged by Michael Gove and his supporters has been a deliberate attempt to whip up hatred towards Muslims. In report leaked by Ofsted to national newspapers it's clear that there is no evidence of extremism or a plot to take over schools yet Ofsted saw fit to make up findings based on instructions from their political masters. In these schools we have Christian governors, Sikh teachers and Muslim staff, far from an Islamist takeover. What is also deplorable has been the timing of today's announcements, coming during exam season for many pupils, Michael Gove doesn't care about these pupils rather he is focused on his neocon agenda. Dominic Cummings, Michael Gove's former adviser, has been commenting about the Trojan horse issue, and Gove's row with Theresa May, quite freely on Twitter this morning. Here are some of his most interesting tweets. \"No notice\" refers to the no notice Ofsted inspections, which the government wants to extend. Left Unity, the new left party, is saying Michael Gove should resign over the Birmingham affair because \"schools, teachers and children are being demonised with not a shred of evidence\". The British Humanist Association is calling for a wider review of the role of religion in schools in the light of the Birmingham affair. In a statement, Andrew Copson, the BHA chief executive argues that it is \"no surprise that some people of another faith will take existing schools of no religious character and effectively treat them as their own 'faith' schools\" when Christian schools get special treatment. David Blunkett, the Labour former education secretary, has called for a cross-party review of claims that Islamist extremists are infiltrating schools. As my colleague Patrick Wintour reports, he said one problem was that oversight of schools had been relaxed. Blunkett said: We do need a cross-party and I would suggest that the two committees \u2013 the home affairs select committee and the education select committee \u2013 should set up a join review because this is a far bigger than a political party or an ideology of a particular minister, this is about the nature of the future of our society and our society does need an open, liberal curriculum that embraces all faiths and no faiths, that teaches children to think for themselves, to examines the evidence, to be able to come to decisions rather than having any ideology, any politics, ,any faith pushed down their throat and that is the nature of the type of education we want. My main concern at the moment is that people seemed to have missed the point that we have a national curriculum, although we no longer have a curriculum authority because it was abolished back in 2011, and we have a national curriculum that doesn\u2019t apply to all schools, it doesn\u2019t apply to Park View Academy Trust because they are academy schools and they are outside the curriculum. So we need to get back to first principles; firstly, should we have a local level of oversight that works; secondly, should we distinguish clearly between what threatens our liberty, our life, and that which threatens our small \u2018l\u2019 liberal society, which was built into the curriculum, and thirdly, whose responsibility is it to do something about it? According to the Press Association, Ofsted has found that an Islamic primary school in Bedfordshire had books promoting stoning, lashing and execution. This is from the PA story. Ofsted said Olive Tree Primary School in Luton, Bedfordshire, was deemed inadequate after inspectors found \"pupils' contact in school with people from different cultures, faiths and traditions is too limited to promote tolerance and respect for the views, lifestyles and customs of other people\". Along with library books that \"promote fundamentalist views\" which \"have no place in British society\", it was found there were too few books about the world's other major religions. Inspectors also said that too many key standards for independent schools were not met in the curriculum, along with the \"spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils, and the welfare, health and safety of pupils\". \"Too little teaching is good enough to ensure that pupils of all abilities make the best progress they can,\" the report added. The fee-paying school, which teaches boys and girls aged five to 11 years and shares its premises with a mosque, was inspected last month with a number of measures for improvement put in place. Books available to children included The Ideal Muslim by Dr Muhammad Ali Al-Hashimi, which advocates parents hitting children if they do not pray by the age of 10, the report said. Another, Commanders Of The Muslim Army by Mahmood Ahmad Ghadanfar, was said to praise individuals who \"loved death more than life in their pursuit of righteous and true religion\". You can read all the Guardian's coverage of the \"Trojan horse\" story here. As for the rest of the papers, here are three articles I found interesting. \u2022 Yasmin Alibhai Brown in the Independent says pupils are being let down by politicians. Some Muslim schools do indeed reject modernist values. A young boy, Ahmed (not his real name) wrote to me from one of these Birmingham schools. He is gay and petrified. \u201cThey say it is a white disease. They will kill me if they know. I cannot live any more. I was in a mixed school before and I was OK. But my parents moved me to this school and I am so alone here.\u201d In January a young Muslim girl emailed to say that she had been forced to wear a headscarf and cloak by her school and she feels trapped. State funds should not be paying for such mis-education. But then no other faith-based schools should be state funded either, because they are places of segregation and separation. Gove has pushed for these schools more than any previous Education Secretary. Here\u2019s the result ... The Ofsted report will no doubt raise howling protests from Muslim apologists and Muslim haters, from educators and politicos, supporters of the schools and their adversaries. My thoughts go out to the children, pawns in political and religious battles not of their making. Poor young things. They deserve better. \u2022 Tim Montgomerie in the Times (paywall) says Michael Gove should be moved in the next reshuffle. Mr Gove is a paradox. He is the politest of men but his intellectual self-confidence and curiosity explain why he will cross dangerous motorways as well as country roads to begin an argument. This explains not only his testy relations with some colleagues, but also his unpopularity with teachers and parents. Although he deserves to be remembered as a great education secretary he has fought on too many fronts. Education now needs what health gained in Jeremy Hunt \u2014 someone to embed his predecessor\u2019s reforms but who can win friends as well as arguments. In the looming reshuffle, David Cameron should put Mr Gove in charge of the Tory manifesto. Mr Gove\u2019s commitment to end illiteracy shows that he understands that Tories must be bold and inspirational if they are to win their first parliamentary majority since 1992. \u2022 Alan Judd, who has advised Gove, defends Gove's stance on tackling extremism in the Daily Telegraph. Of course, there\u2019s no suggestion that those alleged to be Islamising a few Birmingham schools are planning or desiring violence. In fact, only a minority of terrorists in the UK have journeyed to violence via conservative, non-violent Muslim organisations \u2013 they have no time for them. But the traditions and rhetoric of non-violent extremism are the terrorists\u2019 oxygen of justification. They hear and applaud that Jews should be fed to pigs, homosexuals hurled from mountain tops, even simply that apostasy is forbidden (on pain of death, which is often left unstated) or that Shi\u2019a Muslims are not Muslims. It is our tolerance of intolerance that motivates Michael Gove\u2019s mission to resist the ideological subversion of our institutions and democratic practices. This ranges from how evolutionary theory is taught in our classrooms to voter intimidation as recently observed in Tower Hamlets. It is also this that brings him into conflict with the Home Office, whose record on dealing with non-violent extremism he probably sees as ranging from the supine in the 1990s to the counter-productive in the noughties, when under the \u201cPrevent\u201d programme, self-appointed \u201crepresentative\u201d Muslim groups were funded by government in a misguided attempt to deflect people from violence by allowing them to encourage segregation from society and intolerance of all who do not share their beliefs. Here's a statement from Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, on the Ofsted reports into Birmingham. From an unsigned and undated letter has grown this so-called \u2018Trojan Horse\u2019 affair. The highly inflammatory deployment of an anti-terrorism chief to head up the inquiry, the unprecedented and clearly political inspection of 21 schools by Ofsted, and the public squabble between Theresa May and Michael Gove has not been positive for Birmingham schools and the children they educate. There seems to be a redefinition of \u2018extremism\u2019 from the Secretary of State for Education, and as yet lots of speculation and not a little hyperbole. What all this does show is that if schools sever their connection with a local authority, the levers to monitor or effect change available at local level are lost. What is clearly needed is local authorities with powers to monitor and support schools, clear national agreement on the importance of Personal, Social, Health and Economic education (PSHE) and the need to promote community cohesion and the aim to create schools in which individuals feel at ease with themselves and are respectful of difference. Knee jerk reactions from government on the basis of personal predilections are not what is required. Any issues which arise in a school should be capable of discussion and resolution at a local level and be addressed speedily and proportionately. The charge of Islamophobia will stick to this affair unless the schools and their wider communities are seen to be engaged in the solution rather than castigated as being the problem. There will be an urgent question in the Commons to Theresa May, the home secretary, about tackling extremism (and, by implication, her row with Michael Gove). And here is the Guardian video of the Park View educational trust statement. The Telegraph's Andrew Gilligan has written a long blog strongly attacking the Guardian's coverage of the \"Trojan horse\" story. Richard Adams, the Guardian's education editor, has posted it on Twitter. And he has added this. Downing Street has said that Theresa May, the home secretary, did not know about the publication of a letter on the Home Office website last week criticising Michael Gove for his handling of allegations about extremism in schools. This implies that it was Fiona Cunningham, May's special adviser who was forced to resign on Saturday, who was responsible. My colleague Steven Morris is at Park View. He's sent me this. It's hard to over-emphasise the degree of anger at the gates of Park View school from teachers, parents, pupils. I just heard one parent say the only extreme thing about the school was the extreme dedication of the teachers and the extremely good results the school has been achieving. A pupil just made a good point about the timing - in the middle of exams. Why couldn't it have coincided with half term - or why couldn't the government have waited until after exam time? It is uncomfortable to see pupils and teachers having to dodge journalists and camera crews. Saltley school in Birmingham, another that is being downgraded by Ofsted today and placed in special measures, has put out a statement saying that the Ofsted report into it is \"seriously flawed\". Here's an extract. The bold is from the Saltley statement, not from me. According to widespread reporting in the media, Ofsted\u2019s inspections of 21 schools in Birmingham were made in response to the so-called Trojan Horse affair, alleging improper influence in schools exercised by extremists. We wish to stress therefore that Ofsted found not the slightest shred of evidence that there is or ever has been such influence at this school. Parents and the wider community may be wholly confident that students here are safe and well looked after ... In the draft version of its 2014 report, Ofsted used \u2018evidence\u2019 which was apparently gleaned from a Sunday newspaper, not from any observations and interviews at the school itself. The governing body pointed this out and Ofsted deleted the reference. But the fact that Ofsted was prepared to use such \u2018evidence\u2019, and would have done so publicly if the governing body had not drawn attention to it, raises substantial doubts about Ofsted\u2019s professionalism and objectivity. The governing body believes that the report was not written with due respect for appropriate evidence. Yesterday the Birmingham Labour MPs Liam Byrne and Shabana Mahmood issued a joint statement about the the Ofsted investigations. Here is an extract. Now thousands of Muslim parents feel that they and their children are automatically under suspicion, and that the education they receive will be viewed through the prism of counter-terrorism. We simply do not accept this. For many people faith is an integral part of their daily lives. It is a strength to be harnessed which is why today we call on the city\u2019s faith leaders to come together to show the city just how excellence in standards and strength of faith can be coupled better in our state schools. At the same time we hope that the lessons will be learnt. Ofsted must ask some searching questions about how it so misjudged standards in the past. Michael Gove has to tell us how he let things get out of hand. Of the five schools allegedly bound for special measures, four are academies for which he and no-one else is accountable. Faith has inspired greatness in our country \u2013 and has done for centuries. Let\u2019s build an education system in which it can flourish. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, has issued a statement on the Ofsted Birmingham findings. Here it is in full. He said that although most schools did not have serious failings, Ofsted did uncover some \"unacceptable practice\". The reports are clear that the majority of leadership teams working in schools held the line for students despite immense personal pressure and a very real sense of isolation. We should take comfort in the willingness of staff to resist intimidation and put their careers on the line to protect their students. The reports reveal weaknesses in oversight, governance and support. They show that staff with concerns did not know where to turn. We can also see now that the awareness and training in the Prevent strategy should have been extended more consistently into primary schools. Let us be clear that that these findings are serious, if isolated. The majority of schools inspected have been cleared of any serious failings. Nonetheless, unacceptable practice has been reported. The profession should be the first to stand up for the basic entitlements of children in state schools. He spelt out what the problems were. We see three major boundaries: first, governance must be fair and accountable. NAHT has already called for the introduction of formal training for governors along with greater powers to remove governors where there is serious cause for concern. Second, employment practice must adhere to regulation and law. Most importantly, children educated in state schools should be free from discrimination and entitled to receive a broad and balanced curriculum. This includes teaching in sport, music, science, religious education and sex and relationship education. There are examples where all three boundaries have been crossed. And he proposed some lessons that could be learnt Given that autonomy has actually been encouraged and vigilance relaxed, in all but the most serious cases schools should first be offered the chance to bring their own house in order. We also need to learn longer term lessons: we need a confidential route for staff to raise concerns; a clearer statement of the basic entitlement of pupils; a more coherent mechanism to investigate allegations than we have seen in recent weeks; and resources to raise awareness and train staff and governors in the Prevent strategy. We should also separate the Ofsted judgement for governance from that of the professional management of the school, so we can see more clearly where heads and their leadership teams have come under undue pressure. The ability to ban staff and governors who promote extremist positions is welcome. But this power is limited without proper local oversight of both maintained schools and academies which can spot problems early. The power also has gaps relating to the removal of governors. My colleague Steven Morris has send me more reaction to the Ofsted findings from Birmingham. Azhar Qaym, a member of the Muslim Association of Birmingham, said the probe into the schools had been politically-motivated. He said: \u201cPeople have come into Birmingham from London who don't understand the city and don't have our best interests at heart. This is a politically-motivated investigation.\u201d Qaym, who was speaking outside Park View, said it was an excellent school. \u201cIf I lived in this catchment area I'd love the chance to send my daughters here. It's good for Muslims and non Muslims. There is no segregation. \u201cBut the community is sick of the media frenzy taking place here. The Ofsted inspectors have crumbled under the pressure being put on them from ministers. If it was any other community apart from the Muslim community, it would be called racism. The country would be up in arms.\u201d Here are the key points from the Park View statements (see 10.02am and10.59am.) \u2022 Park View educational trust said the way its three schools (Park View, Golden Hillocks and Nansen) had been condemned and put into special measures was \"truly shocking\". \u2022 It said that it would be trying to launch a legal challenge against the Ofsted findings. \u2022 It accused Michael Gove, the education secretary, of a \"knee-jerk\" response to \"climate of suspicion\" created by a hoax letter. \u2022 It said Gove's actions could lead to Park View pupils being stigmatised. This is from David Hughes, the vice chair of the trust. [Politicians] have put Muslim children from these communities at substantial risk of not being accepted as equal, legitimate and valued members of British society, and they have allowed suspicion to be cast on the aspiration of their parents and anyone else who believes that these children deserve the same rights and excellent standard of education as any other child. \u2022 The trust said Park View, Golden Hillocks and Nansen were \"categorically not inadequate schools\". \u2022 Park View was \"the best school of its type in England\", the trust said. \u2022 The trust stressed that it did not tolerate extremism. Our schools do not tolerate or promote extremism of any kind. We have made a major commitment to raising all students' awareness of extremism. People who know and have worked with our schools are appalled at the way we have been misrepresented. And here is the full statement from Lee Donaghy, assistant principal at Park View school, which he delivered alongside David Hughes earlier. (See 10.02am.) On behalf of the staff at Park View, I want to say first and foremost that we reject this report's findings. It is simply not true that the school does not do enough to protect our pupils from the risks of extremism. Every day my colleagues and I work hard to ensure our pupils are disciplined, understand and respect difference and, most of all, achieve well, and in the process gain a full understanding of their religion, the surest guards against extremism of any kind. It is also simply not true that pupils at this school are isolated from British society. As our termly newsletters show, this school provides our pupils with opportunities to rival any state school in Birmingham, and indeed in Britain. This is a normal state school, like thousands of others across Britain. Ninety eight per cent of our pupils just happen to be Muslims - British Muslims. I came into teaching through the Teach First programme in 2004 and came to Park View with the future leaders programme in 2010. As a young person from a working class family in an urban area of Merseyside, with no family history of higher education, a first class education was transformational for my own life chances. It gave my opportunities I would not otherwise have enjoyed. As such, my career in teaching is driven by a determination to deliver the promise that education holds to as many young people as possible. Put simply, my aim is to break the the link between demographics and destiny for the pupils I serve - an aim enshrined in the mission of Park View educational trust and one shared, as he spoke about with the very same words on Saturday, by the education secretary. Despite being an agnostic, this school closely reflects my values and the moral purpose that brought me into teaching, as it does those of my colleagues from all faith backgrounds, and none. For the community in which you now stand, as visitors covering our story, our school stands as a beacon of hope against isolation, poverty, drugs, crime and, yes, potential extremism. Park View is part of the solution, not part of the problem. It is a beacon like no other in this area, a school which achieves what many thought impossible, poor, inner city Muslim children achieving as well as any children anywhere. And now that beacon risks being extinguished. We have nothing to hide. Talk to the parents, talk to our former pupils; they will tell you this is an outstanding schools, with outstanding results, where pupils are taught right from wrong. They will tell you there is no segregation, no extremism, and they will tell you this is a rich, vibrant school that is a key part of its community. This school is part of Britain and Britain is part of this school. Here's some more reaction to the Ofsted findings. It's from Jahan Mahmood, a Birmingham-based researcher on extremism, who claims the way the Ofsted inspections were carried out risked \"radicalising\" the children Ofsted is supposed to protect. I've taken the quote from the Press Association. It beggars belief, how this has been done. The way Ofsted has gone about this is an own goal and in the long run you risk radicalising kids rather than engaging with them. As you can probably guess, the House of Commons has not burned down. (See 10.07am.) I will post the quotes from Lee Donaghy in a moment. Lee Donaghy, assistant principal, at Park View, also condemned the Ofsted report. He said the school was \u201cpart of the solution, not part of the problem\u201d, describing it as \u201ca beacon of hope against isolation, poverty, drugs, crime and \u2013 yes \u2013 potential extremism\u201d. I will post his full quotes soon. But I've got to leave the office for a moment. A fire alarm is going off at the Commons. Hopefully it's just a test. Here is the full statement from David Hughes, the vice chair of Park View educational trust. He stressed that he was not a Muslim himself, but a practising Christian. I have been a governor at Park View school for 17 years and I'm immensely proud of what's been achieved here and what's been done, and very distressed about what happening to undo that work ... On behalf of staff, students and parents who have worked so hard improve their schools, we are extremely disappointed to confirm that Ofsted has graded Park View, Golden Hillocks and Nansen schools as inadequate and put them into special measures. We support the role of Ofsted in holding schools to account in a fair and transparent way, but we wholeheartedly dispute the validity of these gradings. Park View, Golden Hillocks and Nansen are categorically not inadequate schools. Our Ofsted inspections were ordered in a climate of suspicion created by the hoax Trojan letter and by the anonymous, unproven allegations about our schools in the media. Ofsted inspectors came to our schools looking for extremism, looking for segregation, looking for proof that our children have religion forced upon them as part of an Islamic plot. The Ofsted reports find asbsolutely no evidence of this because this is categorically not what is happening at our schools. Our schools do not tolerate or promote extremism of any kind. We have made a major commitment to raising all students' awareness of extremism. People who know and have worked with our schools are appalled at the way we have been misrepresented. Our schools serve some of the most disadvantaged communities in Britain. In spite of this, 75% of students at Park View achieved at least five good GCSEs last year, including in English and maths. This makes it the best school of its type in England. Golden Hillocks and Nansen are on course to get the best results ever. Quite simply, this is because we believe our role is to break the links between demographics, deprivation and destiny. We refuse to let our students' backgrounds limit what they can achieve, and who they can become. The speed and the ferocity with which Park View school in particular has been condemned is truly shocking. Park View school has helped transform the lives of local families by realising their hope and ambition for educational success. School communities at Park View, Golden Hillocks and Nansen that have worked hard to turn round failing schools are being condemned when they should be being celebrated. The problem here is not extremism or segregation or religious indoctrination, all the things that Ofsted looked for but failed to find in our schools. The problem here is the knee-jerk actions of some politicians that have undermined the great work that we do here and undermined community cohesion across Birmingham and across many of our cities. They have put Muslim children from these communities at substantial risk of not being accepted as equal, legitimate and valued members of British society, and they have allowed suspicion to be cast on the aspiration of their parents and anyone else who believes that these children deserve the same rights and excellent standard of education as any other child. And it is important you know we will now be challenging all these reports through the appropriate legal channels. Park View school is responding now to the Ofsted report criticising it. David Hughes, vice chair of Park View academy trust, told a news conference that the trust wholly rejected the Ofsted findings. I will post the full quotes shortly. Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, has issued this response to the announcement from David Cameron about allowing no-notice Ofsted inspections at schools. This is an entirely weak and inadequate response by David Cameron to the gravity of the situation in Birmingham. What we're seeing in Birmingham is part of the systematic failings in the current school system. Cameron's schools policy has delivered a vacuum in the local oversight of our schools, leaving children exposed to falling standards and vulnerable to risks posed by extremists. By refusing to address the inadequate checks in the schools system, Cameron reveals he is happy with the status quo. Labour has pledged to introduce new local directors of school standards to root-out problems before they set in. Overnight David Cameron issued the following statement. Protecting our children is one of the first duties of government and that is why the issue of alleged Islamist extremism in Birmingham schools demands a robust response. The investigation into alleged Islamist extremism in Birmingham schools was triggered by the so-called \"Trojan horse\" letter claiming extremists had staged a takeover in schools in the city. The letter is widely assumed to be a hoax, but it has prompted a series of investigations, including one by Ofsted. The affair has also generated a damaging public feud between Michael Gove, the education secretary, and Theresa May, the home secretary, who have very different ideas about how non-violent extremism should be tackled. Today we should get the chance to find out quite how much evidence there is to back up these concerns. I will be largely focusing on this issue all day. Here is some background reading. \u2022 An analsyis of the \"Trojan horse\" row by Richard Adams, the Guardian's education editor. Just what that takeover entails is central to understanding what the Trojan horse row is all about, and the fall-out between May and Gove. It comes down to a definition of extremism. The claims that have bounced around include allegations of segregated classes, compulsory prayers and incendiary preachers at school assemblies \u2013 but most have crumbled under examination. So the focus for investigation has slipped from extremism to \"an awareness of the risks associated with extremism\" in the elided phrase now used by Ofsted inspectors to condemn the schools most heavily involved, such as Park View academy. \u2022 A Guardian story saying Park View school in Birmingham is expected to be criticised. Park View academy, the Birmingham secondary school at the centre of the alleged Islamist plot known as Trojan horse, will be told next week that it has failed to adequately warn its pupils about extremism and that staff are intimidated by the school's leadership. A controversial Ofsted report ordered by Michael Gove and leaked to the Guardian will highlight that one of the reasons why the school \u2013 previously rated outstanding \u2013 will be downgraded to inadequate is that teachers have not received enough training in the government's anti-extremism Prevent programme. Ofsted's report, due to be published with those into a further 20 Birmingham schools on Monday, says: \"The academy is not doing enough to keep students safe, including raising students' awareness of the risks of extremism.\" \u2022 Today's Guardian story, focusing on Downing Street's overnight announcement that it it wants to give Ofsted the power to stage snap inspections with no notice. And here is the timetable for the day. Morning: David Cameron chairs a meeting of cabinet ministers to discuss extremism in schools. 1.30pm: Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted's chief inspector, publishes the Ofsted reports into the Birmingham schools. 2.30pm: Michael Gove, the education secretary, makes a statement in the Commons.
