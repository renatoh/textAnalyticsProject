With almost all the full caucus results tallied, Obama had a commanding 68%, compared with just 32% for Hillary Clinton. Nebraska's result underlines Obama's strength in red states, and in caucuses. But given that the population of Nebraska is more than 90% white, and has only a tiny black population (78,000 out of 1.7 million state population) this is further evidence of Obama's reach. On the crucial pledged delegate count: on a rough estimate this would give Obama perhaps 16 delegates, and Clinton maybe eight delegates, depending on how the chips fall and later counts go. That would mean a net gain of eight pledged delegates for Obama."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
