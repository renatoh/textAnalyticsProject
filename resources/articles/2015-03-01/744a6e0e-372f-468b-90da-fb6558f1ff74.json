Sterling, following the advice of his representative Aidy Ward, has informed the Liverpool manager that the protracted negotiations over a new contract will not resume until the campaign is over. Officially, Rodgers claimed the reason was the winger\u2019s desire to concentrate on his football and to remove the distraction of a saga that has run since talks began in October. Liverpool have the England international under contract until 2017, so there is no immediate threat of the gifted youngster leaving on his terms, but the latest development is a further indication of the deepening stand-off between the two parties over the terms on offer. Rodgers has said previously that Liverpool will not pay above what they feel a player is worth and that Sterling has been offered \u201can incredible deal\u201d by the club. On Friday the Liverpool manager announced there was no prospect of a resolution before the end of the season. \u201cI\u2019ve had a good conversation with him and our communication is always open,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cI hope now it puts to bed whether or not he is going to sign the contract. \u201cI think that\u2019s the intention. The boy has been advised by his adviser and I have had a good conversation with Raheem. He has made clear what his adviser said to him and that is it.\u201d Asked if he suspected Sterling wanted to delay to see if Liverpool qualify for the Champions League before committing his future to Anfield, the manager replied: \u201cI\u2019m not sure it is about that. I think it is purely so he can concentrate on his football. I think he is a young kid that now every time he is interviewed or asked it is about his contract. \u201cWhat we have been able to do here with Raheem over the last few years is get him to think about nothing from his first waking moment but football. Now it is all about his contract and that is for him and his adviser. \u201cHe is a good boy and I know he loves being here and as I said our talk now is only really about football. His representatives with the club can hopefully get something sorted.\u201d But Rodgers, despite his hopes that Sterling will stay at Liverpool amid reports linking him with a move to Chelsea or Manchester City among others, admitted he was unsure about the player\u2019s long-term plans. \u201cI can\u2019t predict what other people are thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe club have received that advice from his adviser and Raheem has mentioned it to me. That\u2019s it.\u201d Rodgers was speaking in the buildup to Liverpool\u2019s game at home to Manchester United, whose midfielder Michael Carrick has signed a one-year contract extension. Carrick has been one of Louis van Gaal\u2019s best players since he returned from an ankle injury he suffered last summer. The 33-year-old\u2019s contract was due to run out in June. \u201cHe is, for me, my second captain behind Wayne Rooney and he can also read the game as a team player so that\u2019s very important,\u201d United\u2019s manager, Van Gaal, said. \u201cHe has also an excellent pass forward. I like, as a manager, forward passers so that\u2019s very important for me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
