Lightly built and shiny-skinned, this elfin-faced 19-year-old scarcely looks equipped for the world in which she has had to survive. For those who don't know her conflict-ridden story, Dokic escaped war-torn Serbia, fell out with Tennis Australia, was unable to settle in Florida and found herself driven full circle back to Yugoslavia. But she has remained loyal to the father who was ejected from two grand slam tournaments and banned from a third. And despite facing opponents who are five inches taller or 30 pounds heavier she has stayed in contention. Against an unkind fate she has stood ruthlessly contemptuous. It takes less than a minute to discover how. \"You learn how to do it yourself,\" she says curtly. \"I came from a really tough situation and I have had to deal with it.\" As in life, so in tennis. It is with the same drive for survival that she has coped with a cut-throat circuit in which last year she reached the world's top 10 and next week at Wimbledon will be seeded to reach the quarter-finals. \"I learned as a junior that you have to be stronger than everyone else,\" she says. \"It was good for me that there was animosity from the other players. I never had any help on the mental side. I don't like that sort of thing - you have to figure it out for yourself.\" This is Dokic's way. She insists she does not know self-doubt, speaks openly of her self-esteem and says she is always mentally strong. Whether or not that is an accurate self-portrait does not matter; this is the way she has to tell herself to be, because that is what she has learned from her itinerant family. \"This,\" as she sometimes says, \"is the way we are.\" Whatever the potential damage of having imbibed such forceful resilience, the advantages are obvious on an infuriatingly rainy June day in England when her attitude is contrasted to that of some of her rivals. The grass is damp, soft, and awkward to play on. Some players, more used to the greater certainties of hard or clay surfaces, are inclined to give up on it. Not Jelena. She, naturally, \"can deal with that\". The words are beginning to sound like a catchphrase. But all that uprooting, was that not sometimes a bit too hard to handle? \"That's just a tennis player's life - we have to be on the move,\" she says, evading the point, which was about her roots. She is more forthright about the media, alleging they contributed to her decision to quit Australia. Putting up with the press is not so easy. \"Sometimes I'm just not in the mood for them, but I deal with that better than I did,\" she reckons, and immediately proves her point by unmasking a question hinting at some degree of shared technical knowledge as an attempt to ingratiate. Dokic does not use the flailing topspin strokes with the dramatic upper-body swivel that can make it difficult to time the ball on slick grass with a low bounce; instead she batters away with a flat swing and a hissing that sounds as though it would belong at a Great Western Railway reunion. Even if the noise were better left unmentioned, it seems like a decent idea to suggest that her technique gives her an advantage. But apparently not. \"It's the men who mostly hit like that [top, spin],\" she scoffs. \"Most of the women hit flatter. It's not an advantage.\" She slightly lowers her eyelids. Better to have remembered how Tony Roche, then the Australian Davis Cup coach no less, was dismissed rather sensationally in the summer of 2000, ostensibly because daughter and father decided that they could work out the technical side for themselves. That is one reason Jelena has found it hard to accept that her father has not been with her this year. As one would expect from so guarded a family, the reasons for his absence remain unclear. The explanation may be related to the six-month ban from the WTA Tour, served for abusive behaviour in the players' lounge at the US Open in 2000, even though Damir Dokic is said to have become a reformed character since it ended in March last year. But if relieving him of some of the stress of supporting his embattled offspring might sound to some like a wise choice, that is not Jelena's view. \"He wants to take a break. He's got some other things he wants to do,\" she says in a way that signals she will be doing nothing to make her answer less mysterious. \"It would be better if he were here. But I think he will be there at Wimbledon.\" Instead Liliana Dokic has become Jelena's travelling assistant. She does the organising, the packing, the laundry; she ensures that her daughter is where she is meant to be on time, plans the journey and a dozen other things which apparently Damir does not do. Mum brings loads of advantages. Dad helps just with the tennis. Despite that, she still misses him. The extravagantly bearded former truck driver has not been averse to some embarrassing straight talking with strangers and has a liking for a drink or three, but he has been around from the beginning of his daughter's career and that is a massive building-block in their relationship. That might explain why she denies allegations that he has been too tough on her. But there is a pause and the old catchphrase clicks in. \"Actually I have to deal with them both,\" she says. This teenager passed into adulthood a long time ago. Curiously, Damir Dokic has one thing in common with Richard Williams, the father/coach to Venus and Serena. Damir has helped his daughter without having much background in the game. Williams has done likewise. He, however, is said to have picked up his knowledge from books. Damir has not. Which is why it amazes people that his daughter still claims him as a coach. \"When you know your game it's not very hard to figure out what to work on,\" Jelena says. \"You know where you win your matches and where you lose them. The two of us together know what we have to do.\" But then the guard slips. \"I do get homesick and lonely,\" she suddenly confides. \"So I would rather have someone from my family doing it all with me.\" And for a few intriguing moments the real Jelena emerges. Of her little brother Savo, a black belt in taekwondo at 11, she says: \"We love each other as much as you can.\" But does she have any friends on the tour? Can she possibly have any friends, one wonders. \"There are some good people but I don't want to name anyone,\" she answers. Jealousies are rife. What about Monica Seles (a former Yugoslav)? \"We talk. She's had one of the toughest of careers. Her father is such a great loss to her.\" She stops. The Williams sisters? She becomes more fluent. \"I am not best friends with them but I talk with them more than anyone else,\" she says. \"A lot of people think they are arrogant and not good for the game, but I totally disagree. Both have good personalities.\" Dokic appears to identify with their predicament in a white-dominated game. But she does not identify with their tennis. For the first time she becomes negative about herself. \"Size and power are a big advantage - it's definitely more difficult for the smaller players to beat them,\" she says. \"They are a level above everyone else. A lot of players feel that and they get down when they play them. \"The game is becoming like that. It's all just speed,\" she grumbles. \"It's not what it was 20 years ago and I don't think technique or anything else matters.\" The thought of Wimbledon shines through this little piece of gloom. In three attempts she has never failed to get to the fourth round or beyond. \"Oh yes, I would definitely love to win this more than anything else. Everything started for me there,\" she says of her defeat of the top-seeded Martina Hingis in the first round of Wimbledon in 1999. \"I go into every year relaxed and confident. \"Maybe I have a relationship with the English fans more than any other country. I've always had a lot of support every year. I think it's because I've always done well at Wimbledon. In England they follow tennis more than anyone else.\" Actually, it is Wimbledon they follow more than anyone else, but it is best to let that pass. For by now she is proffering a different view of those giant Williams sisters. \"I would have to catch them on a bad day, but they are beatable - we have seen them beaten. The more you play them the more comfortable you get.\" And the more she dwells on that thought, the more comfortable she appears to become. Physically Dokic is stronger than she was a year ago. She has needed to become so because injuries, a problem until a few months ago, had to be held at bay. How well they have healed may determine how well she does. For if the body is properly prepared, this particular mind was ready long ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
