So those who watched Donald Trump\u2019s extraordinary press conference alongside Vladimir Putin might well be feeling nauseous, several hours later. Listening to Trump\u2019s responses about Russian acts of aggression, it was hard to know who was playing the role of the American president. His performance was so nakedly, brazenly pro-Russian, you had to wonder what ranks higher on the Trumpian scale of stupidity: the president\u2019s own intellect or his dim view of ours. George Orwell conjured up a totalitarian regime where Ignorance Is Strength, but he surely never conceived of this. How can we know that two and two make four, or that the DNC isn\u2019t responsible for its own hacking, or that Vladimir Putin isn\u2019t a bigger American friend than the entire European Union and Nato alliance? As Trump explained so clearly, when he talks about Russia as a rival, he really means it as a compliment, no matter what your lying ears have told you. So you may have heard him tell CBS that Russia is a \u201cfoe in certain respects\u201d. But you obviously heard wrong. Right? \u201cWell, actually I called him a competitor,\u201d said Trump, flicking the gaslight on and off. \u201cAnd a good competitor he is. And I think the word \u2018competitor\u2019 is a compliment.\u201d Whatever you say, comrade. The man pretending to be the American president spent most of his time posing in what purported to be a press conference. He pouted and thrust his chin out in the style made famous by Benito Mussolini. He pensively nodded like Pablo Escobar in Narcos on Netflix. It was hard to see Putin\u2019s facial expression because his skin has been stretched so tight across his skull. Besides, underneath all that plastic surgery, there\u2019s the face of \u201can intelligence officer\u201d, as he reminded us all. This rank-and-file Russian officer did what Moscow\u2019s finest have done for so long. He made sure his best asset was staying on track (a remarkably easy feat; this one is almost too enthusiastic), and he continued to wage war against the real enemy: the Magnitsky Act. Sergei Magnitsky was murdered in a Russian jail, leading to the most unfortunate regime of sanctions against the regular business types who make up Putin\u2019s cartel. If you think the sanctions are a sideshow, you should know that the Russian lawyer in the infamous Trump Tower meeting in June of the election year wanted to trade dirt on Hillary Clinton in exchange for lifting them. And somehow the name of the man behind those sanctions, US-born British hedge fund manager Bill Browder, emerged from Putin\u2019s lips on Monday, at the heart of a scandal that is so epic, and so unreported, that it surely deserves its own special counsel investigation. Putin claimed that Browder\u2019s associates had earned $1.5bn in Russia and donated $400m to Hillary, in what must count as the largest single donation to an American politician in recorded history. At this point, Trump\u2019s startlingly white eyes squinted, he puckered his lips to sour candy status, and his nodded approval plumbed new depths of unbridled admiration. The reference to Browder \u2013 who said after the press conference that he had not donated a penny to the Clinton campaign \u2013 was part of a marvelous compromise, according to the Russian sleeper agent living in the White House, who called it \u201can interesting idea\u201d for resolving this whole investigation nonsense. As Putin explained, Robert Mueller was totally free to question the 12 Russian intelligence officers indicted on Friday for hacking into Democratic emails \u2013 or rather, be present at their questioning. As long as Mueller interrogated Browder and company, in the presence of some novichok-wielding Russians. \u201cWe can meet you halfway,\u201d said Putin, sounding as reasonable as Molotov and Ribbentrop surely did. As the sick laughter died down at the CIA and FBI headquarters back home, Trump continued to swoon in a state known to counterintelligence as \u201cNo Puppet, No Puppet, You\u2019re the Puppet\u201d. This is the Twilight Zone of Trump\u2019s conspiracies, where all the disparate threads of disinformation weave together to make the patchwork quilt of crazy known as prime time on Fox News and Russia Today. \u201cMy people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said that it\u2019s Russia,\u201d Trump said, referring to his own director of national intelligence. That would be the American director of American national intelligence. \u201cI have President Putin; he just said it\u2019s not Russia,\u201d Trump continued, talking about the Russian president of the Russian Federation. \u201cI will say this: I don\u2019t see any reason why it would be. But I really do want to see the server. But I have confidence in both parties. I, I really believe that this will probably go on for a while. But I don\u2019t think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server. What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC? Where are those servers? They\u2019re missing. Where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails? Thirty-three thousand emails gone. Just gone. I think in Russia they wouldn\u2019t be gone so easily. I think it\u2019s a disgrace that we can\u2019t get Hillary Clinton\u2019s 33,000 emails.\u201d You know what else is missing? Elvis Presley at the chip shop. The X-files on Area 51. And the president\u2019s patriotic duty, if not his brain. It seemed so normal that this eruption was the first work-product of Trump\u2019s new communications chief, Bill Shine, the former Fox News exec, jammed in just before no less than two Fox News interviews with those titans of journalism, Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Why take the word of all your intelligence agencies when you have the word of Putin and Fox News to outweigh them? Now, according to some dumb lawyers at Trump\u2019s own justice department, Putin\u2019s intelligence agents got to work hacking the DNC on the very same day Trump himself asked them to do so. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d said a candidate called Donald Trump. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d And the rewards were indeed truly mighty for everyone involved. \u201cThere was no collusion at all. Everybody knows it,\u201d declared Moscow\u2019s greatest asset. \u201cAnd people are being brought out to the fore. So far that I know, virtually none of it related to the campaign. And they\u2019re going to have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, Agent Orange. They are trying really hard. \u201cThat was a clean campaign. I beat Hillary Clinton easily,\u201d he insisted. After all, how do we know that Trump lost to Clinton by almost three million votes? How do we know there was collusion, just because he asked for some collusion in public? How do we know that two plus two is four? Trump said he didn\u2019t know Putin at the time. Putin said he didn\u2019t know Trump was in the country when he never got all that kompromat. Nobody knows anything. Except that Pakistani guy, who knows everything. \u201cIn general, we are glad with the outcome of our first full-scale meeting,\u201d said Putin, after completing Trump\u2019s semi-annual employment review. \u201cI hope that we start to understand each other better.\u201d It\u2019s not really possible for two leaders to understand each other any better. And so they literally embraced, warmly, radiating mutual admiration, if not polonium. Looking at all those formerly sane Republicans sitting in the front row of the press conference \u2013 like Jon Huntsman, the ex-Utah governor now serving as Trump\u2019s ambassador \u2013 you could only feel their pain. As with all recent massacres, we must take a minute to sympathize with the victims here, who have lost so much: their credibility, their future careers, and their chance for a quiet dinner at the local restaurant. At a time like this, have a heart for the Republican party that suffers this unpatriotic nonsense in silence. There\u2019s nothing else we can do for them now. We can only send them our thoughts and prayers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
