The billboard, which went up over the weekend, puts images of the four progressive Democratic congresswomen under the phrase \u201cThe 4 Horsemen Cometh\u201d, and goes on to describe them as \u201cidiots\u201d. The Cherokee Guns\u2019 owner, Doc Wacholz, has denied that the billboard on Route 64 outside Murphy is a deliberate provocation. \u201cI\u2019m not inciting any violence or being racist. It\u2019s a statement. It\u2019s an opinion,\u201d he told the Asheville Citizen Times. However, he then made racist and incorrect statements about the four leftwing congresswomen of color. \u201cThey\u2019re socialists, from my point of view. I also feel a couple of them, being Muslim, have ties to actual terrorists groups,\u201d he said. The signage joins previous Cherokee Guns billboards that have depicted words or images designed to denigrate Muslim Americans. In 2017, the store posted an ad for \u201cINFIDEL ARMAMENT\u201d it read in block letters above Arabic script and a rifle. In 2015 the Asheville Citizen-Times reported a billboard that said: \u201cGive me your tired, your poor \u2026 Keep your Syrian refugees.\u201d The incident comes after Donald Trump issued provocative tweets telling Omar, who is Somali American, and her colleagues to \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from. The four congresswomen have become known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d and are prominent and vocal critics of the president. But some groups warned that Wacholz\u2019s advert is a step toward actual violence. \u201cThreats against members of Congress, particularly minority members, are [trending upward] and it is driven by the president\u2019s racial rhetoric,\u201d the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence wrote in a statement. \u201cThis is dangerous!!!\u201d In a tweet on Wednesday evening, Tlaib asked how the billboard could not be considered an aggressive inducement. \u201cHow the hell is this not inciting violence?\u201d she wrote. Pressley tweeted: \u201c#Racist rhetoric from the occupant of the @WhiteHouse has made hate our new normal. We are still vulnerable.\u201d But appeals for civility appear to be falling on deaf ears. Wacholz amped up his attack when the store posted a statement on Facebook that said it planned to produce clothing with the billboard\u2019s image. \u201cAlright my fellow Infidels for Trump \u2026 due to OVERWHELMING demand \u2026 you may come by the shop (next week) and get your very own FOUR HORSEMEN COMETH STICKER \u2026 simple \u2026 eat a piece of bacon \u2026 tell us you\u2019re voting for Trump in 2020 \u2026 then get your limited edition bumper sticker! (While supplies last!) Snowflakes and Liberals are not eligible \u2026 sorry ...\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
