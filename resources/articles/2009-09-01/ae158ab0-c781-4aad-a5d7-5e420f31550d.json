This three-day series of programmes, which ended yesterday, features Ed Stourton travelling along the river Jordan, reading its complex geographical, political and religious significance. It's a bit like Bruce Parry's Amazon, but without the presenter drinking hallucinogenic potions while the locals giggle. That's not to say that Stourton wasn't quite the impressive daredevil at times. He conducted an interview with an imam while they kayaked over some rapids, as you do. \"We're approaching a set of rapids!\" Stourton bellowed. \"Yow!\" He paused for the adrenaline rush. \"Now, where were we? We were talking about concepts of paradise, I think. I can't quite remember.\" At moments like this, and in his vivid observations of riverside places (\"the whispering leaves of a wild mulberry tree\"), it's almost as if Stourton was deliberately being extra brilliant following his departure from Today, but also relishing the creative, luxurious freedoms of such an in-depth format. Stourton sought out the unexpected by this ancient Middle East river. He visited a ski resort on the Israeli- Syrian border, noting that there were 30 miles of ski-runs \"in sight of the Syrian sentries whose army lost the Golan Heights in 1967\". It was one of many startling and memorable moments in this beautifully reported journey."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
