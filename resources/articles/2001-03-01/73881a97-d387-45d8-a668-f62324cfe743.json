To find out, the Guardian is today launching the first text message poetry competition with Guardian Unlimited and in association with Consult Hyperion, which built the infrastructure. It is open to everyone, particularly those who have never thought of writing a poem before. A prize of \u00a31,000 will be given for the best entry, \u00a3500 for the second best and \u00a3100 for each of three runners-up. It is the first competition of its kind with a special interactive feature. The final short list of seven poems will be \"texted\" to all entrants - one poem a day for seven days - so participants themselves will be the ultimate judges. Otherwise, there are no rules. It is up to participants whether they use ordinary language or interlace it with text messaging shorthand - and whether full stops are used or a symbol to indicate the end of a line. You can, as Andrew Wilson suggests stick to one theme, or try to pack in as many as you can. This is a new literary form and it must be left to define its own parameters. In this competition the medium really is the message. Text messaging has already become one of the most successful activities of all time. A few years ago it had hardly been heard of. Yet last year more than six billion individual messages were sent between mobile phones in the UK alone. In January this year over 900m were sent. Mostly they involve the exchange of service information, facts, sport updates, share prices, trivia and gossip. In the process, text messaging has created a whole new layer of remote person-to-person social exchanges. And we are only at the start of what is clearly going to be a massive communications revolution, in which virtually everyone in the industrialised world will have a mobile device - eventually capable of two-way video links - with them all the time. Text messaging can also be used creatively, and the Guardian competition will test the possibilities. The procedure is simple. For two weeks from today, mobile phone users can submit poems of no more than 160 characters (the maximum possible with a text message) by sending them to 07753 828610 . You can send more than one but remember you will have to pay the usual cost charged by your service provider. A selection of poems from the entries will be featured every day on Guardian Unlimited along with the full terms and conditions of the competition. If you can't send a text message then now is the time to learn. It is probably the simplest of all the information age techniques to master. All entrants will receive an acknowledgement of their summissions on April 22 just before the final seven are judged. Only one notification per phone will be sent. Before that Matt Locke, artistic director of The Media Centre in Huddersfield ( www.test.org.uk ) and Andrew Wilson, editor of Centrifugalforces ( www.centrifugalforces. co.uk ), who suggested the interactive element, will draw up a \"long\" shortlist of 100. This will then be reduced to seven by an expert panel: UA Fanthorpe, described in the Financial Times as \"the poet who can suddenly hit you below the heart\"; Peter Sansom, former poet in residence with Marks and Spencer; and Justine Jordan, Guardian Unlimited books editor. On April 22, all entrants will be texted a message to remind them that, starting the following day, they will be sent one of the final seven poems every day for a week at around lunchtime for judging. They should reply, immediately if possible, with a mark from 1 to 10 (numerals, please, not letters). Only those responding to the first request will be sent the remaining six entries. Winners will be notified by phone on May 2 and the results, together with examples of other entries, will be published in Guardian Online on May 3. No employees of the Guardian, Consult Hyperion or anyone connected to the competition or its promotion may enter. We reserve the right to adjust the rules if there is an unexpectedly large number of entries. Step by step 1. Mar 29 to April 13: Text us a poem to 07753 828610 2.
