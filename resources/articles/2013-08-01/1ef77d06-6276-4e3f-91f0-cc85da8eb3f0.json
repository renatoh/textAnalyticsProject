But then the dude from the PGA says something lovely, the sort of line you rarely hear at these shindigs: \"This has got to be sweet redemption!\" Yep, it's got to be. \"I can't believe this is happening to me,\" says Dufner. \"It hasn't hit home yet. I decided I was going to be confident and put my best foot forward, I wasn't going to play scared. The last two holes were a little unfortunate, I wish I could have closed out with no bogeys, but I'm happy to get the job done, and it's a big step for me.\" It's a gracious and warm speech, and while he's not the sort to make a huge song and dance about winning, you can see in his eyes he's delighted to slay the demons of Atlanta Athletic Club. He's the type of sporting star that's getting rarer in these tiresomely relentless days: the kind of guy who looks like he's jumped the rope and joined in. The kind of player us normal folk are in our dreams. You could say this is a victory for everyman and everywoman, though of course it's not exactly that. Jason Dufner is a hell of a talent, and there aren't that many major winners around. Enjoy what's left of the weekend, wherever you are, and raise a glass to The Somnambulist, and one of the most heartwarming wins of recent times! Nighty night! The final standings: -10: Dufner -8: Furyk -7: Stenson -6: Blixt -5: Piercy, Scott -4: Toms -3: Day, Z Johnson, D Johnson, McIlroy Further Dufner reaction: C. JASON DUFNER IS THE 2013 PGA CHAMPION! He rolls his first putt up to a couple of inches, then taps in. Both fists are held aloft in the air, he allows himself a little smile - he's not the coolest man in golf for nothing - and then he hugs his wife Amanda. And then, a lovely touch this, he's embraced warmly by his friend Keegan Bradley, who pipped him to the post two years ago, and is delighted to see The Somnambulist finally land the major title his talent has richly deserved! Can there be a more popular winner?! Furyk paces around his putt. This might take some time. Hell, can you blame him? It's got to go in, really, and even then Dufner will have two putts for the title. It's down the green, 30 feet from the cup. He sets it trundling down the green, but it's never turning right to left, and stays on the high side. He cleans it up for bogey, dropping back to -8. and signs for a one-over 71. The stage is set for Jason Dufner to banish the ghosts of 2011. Furyk, strutting up the last, and Dufner, ambling up it, are given a stunning reception by the gallery. Such warm appreciation, such sweet thunder. Furyk is in the deep stuff down the bank. He punches his ball into the air, and finds the back of the green, about the best he could do. Then it's Dufner's turn. His ball's really snagged up, this is a hellish lie. He wastes no time in getting over the ball - and whips an excellent shot, in the circumstances, onto the front of the green. He's left himself a 15-footer for par, but as things stand, two putts will be enough. \"Dufner looks like he'd prefer to be anywhere but where he is at the moment,\" notes Ian Copestake, not incorrectly. \"It's a bit like teaching.\" Furyk's up first, and he whips an iron short and left, his ball snagging in the kind of thick rough that caused him so much trouble on the last hole. Dufner should be feeling a little better now, though this is still one hell of a shot, and it wouldn't be impossible for his hole to spiral out of control. And he's come up short, his ball disappearing into the thick rough like a mouse into a skirting-board hole! This isn't over yet! Up on the green, Blixt can't drain a 15-foot par saver, and his tournament ends bogey-bogey. A shame, but a fourth-place finish in his second major championship ain't too shabby. He signs for a 70, -6 for the tournament. Stenson knocks in a six-footer for par, and remains at -7 in third, after a slightly disappointing 70 for the man who started the day as the bookies' favourite. Another great major from the Swede, and he'll be back next year. Yep, the nerves will be trilling like a Lionel Hampton vibraphone solo now. Dufner drives into the thick stuff down the right, though only just, and the lie doesn't look too bad. He may well be able to make the green from there. Furyk follows him, but because he's shorter in length, so is the rough he's found himself in. Tension? Yes ma'am, yes sir! He can't, no. His first bogey of the day, and what a time to make it. He pulled that putt, you could see the face of his putter turn to the left before he even hit the ball, which bumped apologetically to the left of the hole. Oh man, that was difficult to watch. A bogey for Dufner, too, and the nerves will really be jangling now. -11: Dufner (17) -9: Furyk (17) Though Furyk's not on the green, Dufner's ball is much further away, and after a brief discussion, The Somnambulist will putt first. A long rake down the green, and it's a good effort, though it goes five feet past. The door's ajar for Furyk, but it slams shut on his fingers, as he wafts the club under the ball, fluffs his chip, and leaves it in the rough. Oh dear. His second attempt, though, is a magnificent effort, which is a ball's width to the right from dropping in to save his par. Bogey. He's back to -9. Can Dufner save his par, and take a three-shot lead down the final hole? Stenson's challenge is over: he bogeys 17. And the Swedish (and Scandinavian) wait for a major continues, because Blixt's par putt lips out, too, and the pair slip back to -7. It's a duel between Furyk and Dufner now. Furyk tries to fade a fairway wood round the corner, but it flies straight as an arrow, and nestles in thick stuff by the left of the green. Dufner plays it safe, Furyk style, aiming for the fat of the green. He finds it, plumb centre, but leaves himself a long two-putt for par. Meanwhile Adam Scott bogeys the last, a sad end to a challenge that in truth never quite had the same momentum over the weekend. -12: Dufner (16) -10: Furyk (16) -7: Stenson (17), Blixt (17) -5: Piercy (F), Scott (F) Another hole, another magnificent drive by Dufner, who splits 17 in half and will have a direct route into the green. Furyk skelps one with his big stick too, and it also finds the fairway, though tight on the right, which might mean he'll have to manufacture something if he's to reach in regulation. Furyk takes a ludicrous amount of time to line up his putt. It's important, and all that, but nevertheless there are limits. Eventually, after orbiting it awhile at planet speed, he steps up and gives it a clack. And, well, you can't argue with the results: he sends the ball on an unerring journey into the back of the cup, and that's a brilliant birdie. Unfortunately for Furyk, Dufner also pops his away. This is a stunning display by Dufner, who has still no bogeys on his card today, has responded to everything Furyk has thrown at him, and is two holes away from redemption. -12: Dufner (16) -10: Furyk (16) -8: Stenson (8), Blixt (8) Dufner delivers what could be the killer blow on 16. Furyk hits a decent approach into the green, pin high to 12 feet, a decent chance for birdie. But Dufner lifts his wedge over the flag, the ball spinning back to two feet. Dufner being Dufner, that's not a gimme for birdie, though it should be. That was a majestic iron, his control into the greens today has been out of this world. Furyk really needs this birdie putt. Scott rattles in a monster on 17 for par. It won't matter, but he stays at -6. Up on 18, McIlroy makes par to sign for a level-par 70. Not ideal, but after Muirfield, that's a top-ten finish, and he's hopefully on the way back. There's always next year, which is something he can say at least another 20 times. Furyk puts a brilliant putt away, and Dufner wastes no time in clattering his in, too. Furyk fist-pumps the air, though you do wonder whether par was enough there. I suppose with the closing holes being what they are, he's playing the percentages, and hoping Dufner collapses again. That doesn't look like happening quite yet, because Dufner clatters a huge drive down 16. Furyk sends his into the light rough to the left, but he should be OK. Meantime, Stenson fails to hit his birdie putt up on the green, and remains at -8, where he's joined by Blixt, who rakes in a similar effort. His was travelling in at pace, he wasn't going to die wondering. The Swedes need a little something over the closing two holes, which unfortunately for them, are two of the toughest in major-championship golf. Time's running out for Stenson, unless the leading pair capitulate, which in fairness is not out of the question. He sends his second at 16 to 15 feet, half a chance of birdie. On 15, Furyk's pace on the greens deserts him for once, leaving his long birdie effort up the green a good 12 feet short. Dufner bumps another hybrid to three feet, though he's missed those before this week, and that's not a par we can chalk up yet. Scott lets a weak putt slide by on the left at 16, and that's a bogey. If he wasn't already gone, he is now. A recap of where we are: -11: Dufner (14) -9: Furyk (14) -8: Stenson (15) -7: Blixt (15) -6: Scott (16) -5: Piercy (F) You could forgive Dufner for having hellish 'Nam-style flashbacks to 24 months ago, when he dumped his tee shot at 15 in the water with the 2011 PGA in the palm of his hand. Because here he is, standing on the 15th tee, with the pin next to the water on the right of the green. Gulp. He strokes a beautiful 6-iron pin high, and is slightly unfortunate that the ball turns left and nearly topples off the green, stopping on the apron. Still, he'd have taken that, with the demons circling in and out of the black clouds orbiting his head. Furyk hits a 7-iron for safety, into the fat heart of the green, but that's miles from the flag. A strange decision, seeing he's two behind with holes running out. Still, time will tell. Shades of Todd Hamilton at the 2004 Open - no, don't leave - as Dufner uses a hybrid to nudge his ball from the slightly longer grass towards the hole. He gets it dead; par. Furyk dribbles a gorgeous one down the slippery green to three feet, then rolls in for his par. Meanwhile Blixt three putts from distance at 16 after leaving his tee shot well short. Furyk sends his second to the middle of 14, but he's left himself a fast downhill putt. Dufner is on the apron at the front, with a much preferable uphill effort awaiting him, though he'll be annoyed his ball span back so much. \"Do you think whoever wins will even bother to lift the Wanamaker trophy?\" wonders Simon McMahon. \"Or just fill it with beer and stick their head in. That's golf, folks!\" Perhaps they could sit in it and let their legs dangle out, while waving at the audience, like Jerry reclining in the Y of the title card to Tom and Jerry. The last group go up 14, and neither of them are of a mind to take a wild lash at the green. Irons split the fairway. The 2001 champion David Toms has had yet another great PGA, incidentally, carding 67 today, and ending his week at -4, currently tied for seventh. Meanwhile the defending champ McIlroy has just made his second bogey of the day - although of course the first was a triple - after missing a short one at 16; he's back to -3. Scott's not letting this lie! He Bob Tways one out of the bunker at 15! Birdie, and he's -7! And Blixt won't let go, either! Birdie at 14 for him, and maybe all that talk of feeling no pressure wasn't just big-leggy nonsense after all! Magnificent effort by the young Swede! The same can't be said for his compatriot, who sets an appalling short par putt way out to the right, the ball completely circumventing the hole in roundabout style. He's back to -8, and has a grim look etched across his coupon. The pressures of coming down the closing stretch of a major championship, right here! Stenson chunks his pitch to 14, completely fannies it, failing to commit, and dumps it in the bunker a few feet in front of him! All of a sudden, a great chance for birdie turns into a desperate scramble for par! Back on 13, the nerves begin to betray The Somnambulist, who prods a tentative birdie effort up the green. It stops short enough for him to get nervous, especially as Furyk elects to tap his par in first - matchplay manoeuvres, ladies and gentlemen - but he makes his par. They move on. Furyk hasn't taken advantage of his ball stopping just short of the fairway creek. His third, from the rough, is left well short of the green, and comes spinning back to boot. He lags a putt up the hill to a couple of feet, perfect pace, but par's not ideal in his situation. \"You know that if Dufner does this he's going to break out into some sort of moonwalk,\" suggests Ian Copestake. Preferably with a beercan on in one hand, a fag (taken from behind the ear and lit off the sole of his shoe) in the other. I would pay cash money. I would pay a lot of cash money. Blixt has birdied 13, by the way. A four-man battle, then? Stenson wheechs his 3-wood to the very limit of the 14th fairway, in prime position to get up and down for birdie. Behind the Swedes, Dufner lays up. He'll have a pitch into the green from 130 yards. Furyk takes out his 3-wood, and sends his ball whistling into thick rough ahead of the green. Dufner clips his wedge to ten feet, below the hole. This is yet another fantastic end to a major championship: 2013's been four from four already, and we don't even know how this one's going to end! Dufner plays it safe from the tee at 13, battering an iron down the middle, making sure he doesn't flirt with the creek running across the fairway. Furyk certainly flirts with it, but his tee shot stops just short. Wow. Up on the green, Stenson is this close to rolling in his eagle effort, the ball sliding to the right at the death and refusing to break back in. Still, that's a birdie, and he's now in second place, level with Furyk, as things stand in what appears to be a three-way battle: -11: Dufner (12) -9: Stenson (13), Furyk (12) -6: Scott (13), Blixt (13) \"That looks like a lay-up to me.\" Pulitzer, please! Because Stenson takes out his fairway wood at 13, and unleashes an animalistic (props to Henry Longhurst (?) at Turnberry in '77) shot straight at the green, the ball bouncing up the narrow strip of fairway leading up to the putting surface, and stopping on the dancefloor, maybe 20 feet from the hole! That's a stunning shot, the sort that lands majors. He's already made one superlative eagle today. Can he send more shockwaves reverberating up the leaderboard? Dufner's putt up the green is a dimple away from dropping, and yet never quite looked as though it was going to go in, always drifting to the right. He taps in for par. A chance for Furyk to close the gap - but he can't take it, the ball agonisingly sliding by to the left. Par, albeit a more painful one than The Somnambulist's. The leaders are both up the fairway on 12. \"The Ben Hogan disciple against the unorthodox club golfer,\" is how John Baxter is styling it. Furyk clacks his second pin high to 12 feet - and Dufner follows suit! This is brilliant stuff, neither man looking in any mood to let it lie. Scott bumps out to eight feet on 13, but lets the par putt slip by, and he's out of this now, you would have thought, at -6. Meanwhile Stenson batters a drive down 13, but his ball drifts out to the left and into the first cut. Much will depend on the lie, but that looks like a lay-up to me. Stenson sends his second into the heart of 14. Solid if unspectacular, but giving himself a 20-foot birdie chance across the green. Two putts, par, -8. Blixt is in some trouble under a tree playing three - but he nearly holes out from 100 yards and will tap in to remain at -6! And all of a sudden Scott's chance to make a mark at 14 has gone, as he fannies a chip 20 yards up the hole, the ball staying in the thick stuff! He simply didn't commit to that shot, and suddenly has a job of getting up and down to save his par! That's an abysmal capitulation, just as he was preparing to manoeuvre himself into position! Dufner doesn't hit his birdie putt, which he'd set off on perfect line. Could he live to regret that? The odd misdemeanour from the tee box apart, the only chink in his armour this week has been his sometimes erratic putting. He stays at -11, two clear of his playing partner. Meanwhile on 13, Scott's got an iron in hand and looking to set himself up for eagle - but doesn't connect cleanly and dumps his ball in lush grass in front of the green. Very poor. Scott absolutely blooters a drive down 13. That's gone miles! Tell you what, he's got a chance to get his second close, and if he was to rake in an eagle putt, he'd be right in the mix! Back on 11, Furyk tickles a putt of the most delicate touch all the way down the green, the ball stopping a couple of turns away from the hole on the right. That's a delightful touch over such a treacherous putt. Dufner's irons have been exquisite, though. On 11, he clatters a 4-iron straight at the pin. It's 12, maybe 15 feet from the hole. A very decent birdie chance. If he keeps swinging as calmly as this, redemption could be on! Furyk's not of a mind to let him romp clear, though, and nearly Calcavecchia's his tee shot straight in the hole! It bounces on, 20 feet past the hole. So unfortunate. Meanwhile up on 13, McIlroy rakes in a long birdie effort to move under par for the day, at -4. The 5th, the 5th, the 5th. What a par saver by Stenson on 11! He's got a downhill putt with a giant left-to-right curve, but no worries: it's in! He remains at -8! Which is just as well, because behind him, Scott begins to make a move, clipping a wedge to ten feet and stroking in the birdie chance to move to -7! Dufner is very much in the box seat, but the field isn't going away. Stenson dunks his tee shot at 11 into thick greenside rough. His chip takes a bit of a flyer. He'll face a 20-footer for par. Dufner can't put away his birdie chance at 10, the ball turning to the left at the death. He nearly misses the tap-in, too, in the manner of the nervy one which secured his 63 on Friday. I hope to God this doesn't haunt him later in this round. Furyk nearly drains his long birdie chance, then staunchly nails the missable four footer back down the track. Pair of pars. As we saw with Dufner along the closing stretch in 2011, nothing's over until it's over. But if he holds his nerve and keeps playing like this, he's going to be hard to beat. Furyk leaves his approach at 10 short, and Dufner zips through the door, lifing a wedge to eight feet, setting up another birdie chance! Dustin Johnson, meanwhile, has been on the move, with birdies at 5, 8, 11 and now 13 (where he was 12 inches from eagle). He's -5, and preparing to position himself in case of collapses up the leaderboard. Dufner and Furyk both send their tee shots at 10 down the main thoroughfare. Up on the green, Blixt rolls in a 25-footer up the slope for birdie! He's back to -6, tied for fourth, though you'd imagine too far back to trouble these leaders: -11: Dufner (9) -9: Furyk (9) -8: Stenson (10) -6: Scott (11), Blixt (10) -5: Piercy (F) Stenson is behind a tree down the left of 10. He squirts his second into a bunker down the right. He's not going to let this go, though, splashing out spectacularly to 12 inches, saving his par. He remains at -8, clinging desperately onto the coattails of the leaders, a strange business in many ways as of course he's physically ahead of them. This is the way of words. Furyk can't make his par putt, the ball drifting off to the left. He drops the shot he picked up at 6, and reaches the turn in a level-par 35. What a result: his first bogey at the first hole he found the fairway on! Dufner, however, looks in no mood to give anything up today. He rolls a gentle left-to-right slider into the cup, saving an unlikely par, rather brilliantly it has to be said. It's the sort of scramble that might see some players racing around waving their arms about and making all manner of noise. Not the Somnambulist! Our hero wanders off the green with all the urgency of a man returning to the fridge because he's changed his mind, he wanted the other can of beer and not the one he'd taken out. A Stenson whistles his drive at 10 into thick rough down the left. Back on 9, Dufner lifts his chip up the hill to ten feet. That's decent from where he was, probably the best he could manage, and yet he's still at risk of dropping a shot. Furyk lobs one onto the green, but it's a poor effort, leaving himself 15 feet to save his par. Up on 11, pars for McIlroy and Westwood, the latter again missing a risible tiddler. He might as well try putting with his 3-iron, for all the good that flat stick does him. Dufner and Furyk both clatter very serviceable tee shots down 9. Up on the green, Stenson putts out for par, reaching the turn in 34 strokes. The Swede having left the green, the leaders are able to get on with their business, though Dufner may as well have gone ahead anyway, leaving his approach a club too short. He'll have a job on to save par from a long way off the front of the green, though it's all uphill. With Dufner in danger of dropping one, the door's ajar for Furyk, but the big man sends his approach into rough to the right of the green, and though closer is arguably in a worse position now. Scott's been quiet since dropping that shot on 6. But suddenly he explodes into life, smoothly sending his second at 9 to three feet, then popping in the birdie putt. He's out in 34, and at -6 not yet out of this championship! Up on the last, a bittersweet end to Piercy's round: a bogey, but he's the new clubhouse leader after carding a brilliant 65 today. Furyk blinks. He can't make his short birdie effort, while Dufner taps in for his. He moves to -11. This is a brilliant performance by The Somnambulist, who is after redemption for 2011. Speaking of players desperate for redemption, Westwood rakes in a long birdie effort on 10, but he's only back to +2, while McIlroy knocks another in, uphill from 12 feet. He's -3, and must be cursing the 5th hole. Furyk hoists yet another stunner towards a flagstick, this time at 8. He's pin high, six feet from the hole, a shot begging to be converted into a birdie. Can Dufner match it? Nope. He can better it! He pitches his ball six feet past the hole, then sends it spinning back to 18 inches. That was so nearly a replay of the eagle at 2 on Friday which kicked off his course-record 63! This is indeed threatening to turn into a matchplay situation, a revisit of the epic haymaker-trading duel between Tiger Woods and Bob May at Valhalla in 2000! Furyk and Dufner both find the fairway at 8. Up on the green, Stenson rolls in his birdie putt, and moves back to -8, two behind the leading pair. And on the closing hole, Jason Day cards his third bogey in a row. Such a disappointing finish after a breathtaking charge up the leaderboard. He ends with a 67, finishing the competition at -3. He's the new clubhouse leader. Furyk nearly slam dunks his pitch into the cup! He'll have a chance to save his par, too, from ten feet. First up, though, is Dufner, who tickles in his par saver. And then Furyk follows him in. What a pair of pars! Neither man looks like they're prepared to give an inch. Meanwhile on 8, Stenson - increasingly looking like the only man who can stop this turning into a matchplay event for the first time since 1957 - knocks his second to six feet! He'll have a chance to immediately reclaim the shot he just gifted to the pair ahead. \"If Dufner's a Caddyshack character, surely it's Spaulding Smails?\" argues Alistair Mackay, not unreasonably. Another dropped shot for Jason Day, this time at 17. He's back to -4, and he's never looked the same since blootering that drive into the woods at 14. Up on 9, McIlroy hits his approach pin high and strokes in the birdie effort. He's back to -2; what might have been, eh? Stenson occasionally makes foolish errors with the putter - he missed a tiddler for birdie at 2 yesterday, for example - and he's just three putted 7, missing a three-footer for par. He's back to -7. The green vacated, Furyk and Dufner can get moving again. And the co-leaders aren't looking too great coming down this hole. Dufner's forced to chip out from the lunacy he steered his drive into. Furyk hoicks his approach into deep filth down the left, in front of a bunker, with the pin tucked behind. That'll test him. Especially as Dufner, from back down the fairway, has lifted his third over the aforementioned bunker, landing it softly on the small portion of the green containing the pin, and giving himself half a chance of scrambling his par. \"Is Dufner the coolest man almost awake?\" wonders nail-seeking hammer Ian Copestake. \"It's as if the Dude was the star of Caddyshack.\" Head located, bang. Ah, hold on, he's just practically snap-hooked a piss-poor drive into the thickest nonsense on the course down the left of 7. Hmm. Furyk's effort - in the rough but at least on the correct side of the trees - now looks marvellous by comparison. Furyk's searching out pars? Oh really? He rolls a gorgeous birdie putt straight down the green and into the cup from 30 feet! He joins Dufner - who gets up and down from the back, nailing a very missable par putt - in the lead at -10! Meanwhile Piercy's not finished yet; he lifts his wedge at 16 to a few feet, leaving himself an uphill putt for birdie. Which he makes, curling one in from right to left from ten feet! Piercy's on his own in fourth at -6! Not so clever from the new leader at 6; Dufner's tee shot nearly falls off the back-left corner of the green. Furyk clips his into the centre of the putting surface. Again, he's playing it safe, searching out pars. Up on 8, McIlroy and Westwood take turns to miss easy birdie chances, the latter in particular missing egregiously, from four feet. It's grim viewing, and I'm not sure I can put you through any more of it. Dufner taps in for his birdie on 5. That was a stunning approach, at a hole which has ruined so many dreams already. Nerveless. A! -10: Dufner (5) -9: Furyk (5) -8: Stenson (5) -5: Day (16), Piercy (15), Scott (6), Blixt (5) Piercy can't get up and down from the back of 15. He's back to -5. Day drops back too, though he splashes delightfully to a couple of feet, limiting the damage to bogey. Both of these chaps have suddenly realised where they were: going down the closing holes of a major, with a chance of winning. And their swings have tightened. Day is in a spot of bother down 16. He hoicks his drive into the thick stuff down the right, then clatters his second into a branch. He'll be trying to get up and down from 100 yards. And he's unlikely to make it, duffing his third into the bunker front right. Furyk finds the heart of the 5th, meanwhile, safety first. But what a shot by Dufner, who arrows an iron straight at the flag, and to hell with worrying about the water! He's rewarded when the ball bites dead two feet from the cup; he'll surely pop that in for a birdie and, unless Furyk sinks a long one, the sole lead! Dufner splits the fairway at 5. Furyk just about holds it down the left. Up on the green, Blixt turns his round 180 degrees by draining a 15-footer for birdie; he's back to -5. Stenson takes two careful putts for par. McIlroy's birdie putt at 7 lips out; he smiles wryly as he leaves the green. Westwood can't summon anything up, though; he drops another. On 6, Scott does well to splash out from the bunker to ten feet, but he can't knock the saver in, though the ball only just slips by on the left. And the unheralded Scotsman Marc Warren birdies 6 and now 8, to move up to -3. He'll be regretting his opening round 74, having followed it up with a 67 and then 68. Dufner gets up and down for his birdie, while Furyk takes two careful putts for his par. The pair are now joint leaders. Piercy has flown his tee shot at 15 straight over the green. McIlroy clips his approach at 7 to four feet, but it's too little, too late. What he'd give to be standing over that putt at 4 again. Scott, who carded his second birdie of the day at the par-five 4th, dumps his tee shot at 6 into the bunker at the front. McDowell drains a birdie putt on 18 for a 66, and he ends the tournament at -2. On 5, Stenson's approach flirts with the idea of spinning back into the water, but this could be his day: it doesn't bite too hard, and only rolls back for a second or two. He's safely on. And Piercy misses his short birdie chance at 14; he remains at -6. Furyk laid up on 4, and his wedge into the green isn't up to much. He'll have a long putt for birdie. There's cautious, and then there's mind-numbingly boring. Up on 15, Day conjures up a stunning sand shot. With water behind the pin, he's got to be perfect, and he is, splashing (in the acceptable sense) to four feet. He should save his par. And on 14, Piercy actually found that bunker, and he clips out to five feet. He'll have a short putt for his eighth (!) birdie of the day. Day's slamdunked his tee shot into a greenside bunker at the left of 15. He'll have a hellish stance. His equilibrium has been jolted by that drive on 14, a shot Piercy does his best to replicate coming behind him. Piercy's drive isn't quite so wild, though, and finds the rough near the bunker front right. Back on 4, Dufner tries to Stenson a wood into the green, and it's a great shot, but it takes a hard bounce and zips through into rough at the back. Unlucky. Still, he can get up and down for his birdie. The first significant move of the day!!! Stenson curls in a 12-foot right-to-left eagle putt on 4! That's no more than his gorgeous fairway wood into the green deserved, and he's sprung up to -8! Day meanwhile scrambles his par on 14, a score that would have seemed nigh-on a disaster before he hit his tee shot, but suddenly looks very acceptable now. Piercy, in a greenside bunker at 13 in two, nearly splashes into the cup. He'll have a five-footer back up the green for birdie. And it's in! He's -6! McIlroy can only get his chip up onto the apron of the green, afeared of sending his ball sailing back into the briny. He ends with a triple bogey, back to -1. Bogey for Westwood, too. He's +1 now. I think it's safe to say that these two are over. As, possibly, Day is. He flicks out from the woods at 14 into a greenside bunker, but he's seriously shortsided, and par will be some result from there. At a hole where, for a player making a trundle at the leaders from the pack, a birdie was essential. McIlroy is falling to pieces. He's flown the green at 5 with his fourth shot, after taking the drop, and is in the thick stuff at the back. With the green on a downslope back towards the water. We've already seen what Brooks Koepka did from there. This could turn ugly. Meanwhile Furyk and Dufner are both safely on 3. Two putts, and their solid march continues apace. And up on 4, Stenson clatters his second, a fairway wood, into the heart of the green, giving himself outside chance of eagle. Day taps in for his birdie on 13, and he's -6. This is complete brilliance from the young Australian, who is due a major as he keeps knocking on the door. This would be outrageous if he managed it today. As things stand, he's -6 for his round - but he's just sliced his drive into trouble down the right of 14, deep into the woods. He's in the lap of the gods; a bad break, and his run at the top of the leaderboard might be over. Scott sends his third at 4 to five feet. On 6, Roberto Castro drains a 40-footer from the back of the green for birdie, his second on the bounce. He's -4. Up on 13, Day creams his second to the front edge of the green. He's so unlucky when his third takes a bump into the air as it rolls towards the pin, but he'll have a tap in for birdie. Back on 5, McIlroy becomes the latest victim of the water. He finds the green, but the ball spins back, agonisingly slowly, before toppling in. Westwood's driven into the water, saving himself the wait. Ten minutes ago, Rory was embarking on a charge. Suddenly, his hopes look lost. Furyk takes his two putts from the centre of 2 for par. He may, wisely, have decided that if he doesn't go backwards, he may well not be caught by a chasing pack stuttering around at the moment. Dufner rolls a solid putt up the hill for his par. These two have done nothing of note yet, but will be happy enough to take their pars. Rory misses his birdie chance on 4 from five feet. That was a terrible putt, he never looked confident as he stood over that. A shame after such a wonderful approach. And you can't be passing those up in his position. Westwood manages to scramble his par. Piercy is the width of a ball from nailing his seventh birdie of the day at 12. Furyk finds the centre of the green at 2. Dufner finds rough at the front from the trees, then chips, leaving himself a five feet uphill effort for par. So there's not been a whole load of movement at the very top yet, but it's probably worth taking a snapshot of where we are at the moment, with a few new names demanding attention on the fringes: -9: Furyk (1) -8: Dufner (1) -6: Stenson (2) -5: Day (12), Piercy (11), Scott (2) -4: McIlroy (3), Stricker (3), Blixt (2) -3: Weekley (13), Toms (6), Castro (3) Another dropped shot for Blixt, this time at 2. That's a 5-5 start, and perhaps his pre-round confidence was slightly misplaced. He's not handling the pressure here at all, and he's back to -4. On 4, McIlroy, full of beans after that long birdie on the previous hole, lifts an approach to six feet! Westwood however, totally deflated, wangs a dreadful shot wide right of the green; he's in deep stuff, with sand in the way too. Meanwhile mixed fortunes for the leaders on 2: Furyk finds the fairway, but Dufner wings a drive into the trees down the right. Furyk rolls in his par putt. That's a magnificent escape, he was in a whole bunch of trouble there. Dufner takes his two putts for a par too. They move on. Stenson can't make his birdie on 2. But up on 12, Day rolls in another long birdie putt. He's -5 now! He's not going to end up second again, is he? Here's Stenson's last five events: tied 21st at the US Open, tied 10th at the BMW International Open, tied third at the Scottish Open, second at the Open, and tied second behind a rampant Tiger at the WGC Bridgestone. He really is the form horse, and he knocks his approach at 2 close, though backspin is not his friend, and he's on the apron. Meanwhile Keegan Bradley bogeys the final hole, and signs for a 66. That was a fine effort from the 2011 champion, his round the best of the day so far, a score matched by Hideki Matsuyama. The pair end the tournament at -1. Scott regains the stroke he dropped at the opening hole on 2. Piercy picks up yet another shot, this time at 11. He's -5, and if someone posts an early total, well, you never know. Back on the opening hole. Furyk is forced to lay up from a terrible lie, but clips his wedge to six feet, giving himself a great chance of getting out of the place unscathed. Dufner has found the heart of the green in two. McIlroy trundles a long birdie effort in on 3 after finding the heart of the green pin high! He's -4! But his playing partner Westwood is out of it already. A double bogey, after failing to escape from greenside rough, and he's back to level par. That's the first man down, then. The 1st has been causing bother alright! Stenson and Blixt both miss their par putts. Back up on the tee, the final pairing make their way out onto the course. Furyk whistles his drive into the rough down the left, while Dufner ambles up to the ball (A) then hammers it into the first cut down the right (A). This opening hole is causing a fair bit of bother. Stenson finds more thick stuff at the front of the green, then races his chip 12 feet past. Blixt ends 20 yards short of the putting surface, but flops one to six feet, giving himself a chance to escape with a par. \"Cold towel is on,\" reports Marcus Christenson. \"Funny looks in office. And that's not a good start.\" McIlroy is so close to making his birdie putt on 2, an effort with a large left to right swing that dies one dimple's width in front of the hole. He's unlucky there, though he didn't quite hit it. He's still at -3, unlike Westwood, who splashes out from sand to four feet, but misses the par putt. He's -2. Back on 1, Scott drops an early shot too, lifting the toe of his putter and sending a short one to the right of the cup. He's back to -4. Stricker makes a calm par. The Swedes are up. I hope Marcus Christenson has a cold towel pressed to his forehead. Stenson wings his drive into the first cut down the right. And then here comes young(ish) Blixt, who is promising fireworks. He sends his ball down the right, too, into the deeper stuff. He says there's no pressure on him, because there's no expectation. We'll see what happens if he's two clear coming down 17. Scott's approach to 1 from the thick rough finds similar stuff to the front right of the green. On 2, the first birdie chance for McIlroy, who sails his approach to 12 feet. Westwood does the deep-rough-to-bunker thing again. Meanwhile up on 10, Day rattles in his second monster in a row, this time a left-to-right-to-left-to-right snaker up 10, to move him up to -4! That was just pure daft, and not totally dissimilar to this putt: Another birdie for Piercy! He's raked in a monster from the far-left reaches of the 9th green, and he's out in 31 shots despite a bogey at 2! He's -4 for the tournament, and barring a preposterous collapse, will be recording his best finish in a major by some considerable distance. And maybe his first top-ten finish, if he keeps this up. David Lynn won't simmer down at the PGA. After blistering his way through the field last year to grab an unexpected second place, he's of a mind to see what happens today, too. Birdie at 2 has been followed by bogey at 3, and then a bounce-back birdie at 4. He's -2 for the championship and it'd be lovely to see another high finish by the former journeyman, especially as he's bonded with the crowds in such good spirit this week after the Lynn Diesel incident. (For those of you, like David's car, not up to speed, he filled his motor full of bogus gas and broke down on the highway. Much to the subsequent monicker-based amusement of his peers and fans. Oop!) Steve Stricker's opening shot finds the first cut of rough down the left. Adam Scott goes one better and dumps his ball in Westwood Country. Up on the green, Rory lags up brilliantly from the front of the green and saves his par, and Westwood makes his too, getting up and down brilliantly from the bunker, sinking the sort of five-foot saver he's made a career as a Nearly Man out of missing. Jason Day has just holed the putt of the day so far, a 30-yarder from the front of the huge 9th green, into the cup at the back! He's out in 32 strokes, and -3 for the championship. Here's a guy threatening a major very soon, though he's left himself too much to do this time round. And the first blemish of the day on Weekley's card, as he can't sink a saver from the back of 10. He's back to -2. A strong start by Scott Piercy, too, who's been hovering around the leaders all week without ever really taking up residency at the top. A bogey at 2, but he's followed it up with birdies at 3, 4, 7 and 8. He's -3 for the tournament. Back on 1, Westwood is in deep filth under the tree he hit down the left. And now he's in sand front right of the green. He's already got that affronted face on, as though none of this is his fault. McIlroy meanwhile sends his second straight at the pin. Unfortunately he's about two clubs short, and the ball lands shy of the green. These two haven't got going yet, which sounds harsh two shots in, but a fast start is essential today for players so far behind. A fast start for Dustin Johnson, who was hot, hot, hot yesterday, and clips his approach pin high to six feet and drains the birdie putt. He's -3. Keegan Bradley's dropped back to -2 with a bogey at 14, a shame as a strong finish would have seen him bother Dufner's new course record. He's -5 for the day through 15 now, and a couple of birdies will tie it. Big ask, though. All eyes on Boo Weekley, I guess. OK, folks, the final day starts now. Up on the 1st tee, the defending champion, Rory McIlroy! Rory has the big stick out, and he's sent his ball bounding into the thick rough down the right. Not sure he's got the worst lie, but nevertheless that's far from ideal. Lee Westwood's up next, and he's got big Bertha out as well. And Jebus H, what an abysmal opening shot, pulled into a tree down the left. The only way is up, Great Britain and Ireland! Boo Weekley, of 2008 Ryder Cup fame, rattles in a putt from the apron at the back of 9. It's his fourth birdie of the day, he's out in 31 strokes, and he's -3 for the championship. Meanwhile Hideki Matsuyama has just made his fourth birdie in a row, and his fifth in the last six holes, at 15. He's -2. Birdies out there! A fast start by one of the players going out soon, and the leaders may experience a draught up their jacksies. Tiger's playing partner, Brooks Koepka, came back in 34, and finished +11, so avoids the ignominy of ending the weekend in last place. That's good news for the young lad, not so good for Darren Clarke, whose knackered old 80 today consigns him to that fate. The old boy's +16. Young Matteo Manassero made a run to save Clarke's face, mind you, coming home in 41 strokes, ending with a 77 that saw him sink to +12. Still, if +12's good enough for Phil Mickelson, it's good enough for him. Right folks, Marcus has done one. He's bolted! Too excited at the prospect of either Blixt or Stenson struggling to lift the Wanamaker Trophy, I think. You're stuck with me again, I'm afraid. And here's someone else who's old news: Mr Tiger Woods. But while he's stunk the place out this week, and will be going five years without a major now, you can't keep a lid on class. Despite all his travails, he's signed off with a flourish: he's come back home in 32 strokes, three under, signs for a level-par 70, and finishes the tournament at +4. The Scot Marc Warren and the American Roberto Castro are the next two to set off. It will be interesting to see whether Warren can produce another fine round of golf today. The camera switches to Stenson - who is eating a sandwich. It looked like a ham sarnie. Cool as you like. I see. Not only has Blixt turned up in a yellow shirt. Stenson is wearing blue. Did they really co-ordinate that this morning? How sweet of those crazy Swedes if that is the case. Keegan Bradley has other things on his mind, however, and is now on six under the par. That's three birdies in a row for the 2011 winner! Oh dear me. Matt Kuchar won't want to remember this weekend. It's not been his best, and it has just got a lot worse. After finding sand on the second hole and failed to get out of it with his first shot, the second one sees the ball get stuck UNDER the grass at the top of the bunker. I have never seen anything like it. If I'd been quick enough I could have done a screen grab and posted a pic here, but, alas, I wasn't. Graeme McDowell drops a shot on 9, ending any wild dreams he had of winning this. Simon McMahon is not interested in McDowell, however, saying: \"The best thing about The Mechanic being the clubhouse leader is that he really doesn't give a toss. I'm guessing he won't be prowling round outside the Scorers Hut waiting to see who comes in at +1.\" Lee Westwood is out there practising. He will be on his way in roughly half an hour. Can he shoot a 65 or a 66 and haul himself into contention? Stranger things have happened. Jonas Blixt, meanwhile, has turned up in a bright, bright yellow shirt. Goodness me. Did he really think that was a good idea fashion-wise or is that just to put Stenson off during their round? Who knows? I guess we will find out. Keegan Bradley is certainly having a good day out there. The American is now on -5 for the day and has joined McDowell on two under par overall. That still leaves him seven behind Furyk, though, and with conditions pretty good today the top players are not going to drop that many shots. Five birdies is not to be sniffed at though for Bradley. Just an hour and a bit then until the men at top of the leaderboard tees off. Adam Scott - who is very much in with a chance - says he \"likes to sleep\" in the morning before a round but today he has been out on his bike. Well, you can't have everything in life, can you Scotty? And if there is something Scott wants more than a sleep it is another major apparently. The taste of winning a major, he says, was as sweet as one can imagine - so he now wants another way. McDowell, meanwhile, is now -2. And with that, I'm off to chow down on a mountain of the only foodstuff ever marketed by a talking golf glove. Yes, the Helper. Anyway, Marcus Christenson is your man for the next stretch. See you again soon ... Here's someone else going on a birdie charge. Graeme McDowell's putting has deserted him all week - he's given himself plenty of opportunities, yet nothing's dropped - but suddenly he's holing them. A run of four birdies on the spin, the highlight being his tee shot at 6 which was three feet from an ace, and he's suddenly -1 for the tournament. Keegan Bradley's still motoring too, and after a run of pars between 5 and 10, his fourth birdie of the day moves the 2011 champ up to -1 too. Scores out here, there are scores out here. Can one of the pack just behind Furyk, Dufner, Stenson, Blixt, Stricker and Scott string something together, and turn the pressure up on the leaders? Oak Hill's going to give them all a chance. A bogey to finish for Jimenez, a slightly sad end to his tournament, given that run of five birdies on the back nine. He's still back in 32, though, and signs for a 67, finishing at +2. His card's currently the best of the day - and he's the clubhouse leader at the moment, for what that's worth - though you'd think at least couple of players in the field will better it as the day wears on. Rose becomes the latest victim of the water crossing across the front of the 5th. He's wet, and that's a double bogey; he's back to +3. Tiger escapes from 13 with a par, playing it almost like a links hole at the end, a long putt from back up the fairway in the Scottish style, to get close and scramble his saver. And good news to report of his playing partner Koepka, who birdied 11 and 12, and is back to +10. More shots of Dufner wandering around the course, bored, waiting to tee off in just under two hours. He's just been for a massage, apparently. He certainly looks very post-spa relaxed, but then what's new. I imagine he walks around, all the time, with the gentle pan-pipe music they play in those places on constant loop in his head. Or The Girl from Ipanema, or Brazil. Actually, this is what he'll be hearing, 24/7, the soundtrack of his life: Tiger blooters an awful drive into the trees down the left of 13, then feels for a twinge in the small of his back. The players are going for broke at this hole, because - wisely - the powers that be have moved the tee forward 30 yards or so, meaning the green's now reachable in two booms. Beforehand, players were just taking two careful irons and a wedge, the most boring hole on the course by some distance. Now we could see some fireworks, especially from players nearer the top who'll be chasing the leaders. Heeee! Thompson will be adding another birdie to his haul soon enough, bouncing his third shot into the par-five 4th off a bank to the left of the flag and sending his ball to within two feet. Magnificent! He's -2. Up on 12, a shaft of light for Tiger, who sends a crisp iron to four feet and sinks the birdie putt; he's +6 now. And up on 13, Kaymer's rollercoaster continues: after a birdie at 12, he puts his second pin high after going for broke at the par-five 13th, then draining the eagle putt! He's back to +4. Golf, golf, golf. Meanwhile Blixt looks very relaxed ahead of the biggest round of his life. He's being interviewed by the Sky Telecast Agency, and he's asked about his aggressive style of play. \"I don't like to lay up,\" he laughs. \"If I don't go for the pins, I don't make any birdies.\" You can't say fairer than that. Is he going to be aggressive today? \"Absolutely!\" Will winning a major be any different than winning his two titles on tour? \"That's up to you to determine that,\" he guffaws. \"I'm going to try my best to win it.\" He really does not give a flying one for pat interview responses, and plays his golf in the swashbuckling style, while enjoying it too. I like his style very much indeed. If only Sergio thought and acted like this, he'd be hunting down Walter Hagen's major haul by now. A decent start for Michael Thompson, who tied for second at the US Open last year, and showed well at Augusta back in April. He's birdied 2 and 3, and he's up to -1. The sort of opening a few of the chaps up the leaderboard will be hoping and praying for. \"I'm going to have to make a fast start,\" says Rory McIlroy, who has apparently been chatting at breakfast about the 62 he shot to win at Quail Hollow back in 2010. \"I'll be drawing on that experience.\" One way or another, his opening salvo is going to be an awful lot of fun. Bradley keeps his momentum going with a staunch scramble on 7 for par. He's still -3 for his round, level for the championship, and along with the incendiary Jimenez, is proof positive that Oak Hill is there for the taking if the players keep their ball away from nonsense. There's no return from that stuff. But that's the weather debate over, it would seem. Clark's tee shot at 11 may well have been the straightest shot of all time, according to the arm gesticulations of the great deconstructionist Jimenez - who incidentally has birdied five holes on the bounce between 12 and 16, and is back up to +1!!! - but Simon McMahon suggests there is competition: \"I remember watching from behind the tee, the Scottish Open at Gleneagles around 1987. Tommy Horton, I think it was, driving the ball about 275 yards, arrow straight, down the middle of the fairway. It didn't deviate an inch from its path once it left the ground. As a 16 year old who could only hook or slice a golf ball about 100 yards off the tee and into the trees, I was flabbergasted.\" Golf's not meant to be understood, is it, though? Look what happened to Sandy Lyle, the minute he tried to do a Faldo and started thinking about it. The beautiful complexities golf, ladies and gentlemen! After making a two-bounce hole in one on 11, Tim Clark dumps his tee shot at the par-three 15th straight into the lake. He can thank the internet for that, and the online shower who voted to place the pin right next to the drink. Oh internet! Koepka's playing partner Tiger isn't exactly showing the young lad the way. One of many short putts missed this week at 9, and he's double bogeyed the hole! He's out in 38, and slumped back down to +7. So, how tough will the course play today, then? Traditionalists will hope the wind picks up a little, and the leaders stubble, so the winning score isn't too low. Best winning score here was set by Jack Nicklaus, -6 at the PGA in 1980. Lee Trevino won the 1968 US Open with a score of -5, Shaun Micheel won the last PGA here in 2003 with -4, Curtis Strange won the 1989 US Open at -2, and Cary Middlecoff was +1 when he won the 1956 US Open. News of Tiger, who started off with seven pars, but has dropped one at 8 after clattering his drive into the trees down the left. He's +5. Meanwhile Darren Clarke is now in last place: a double bogey 6 at the last set the seal on an 80. Oh my. He's +16 for the tournament, and odds on to be propping the entire field up come the end of the day, three adrift of Woodland and another shy of Mickelson. But he may well be saved by poor young Koepka, though, who like Tiger dropped a shot on 8, has shed another at 9, and having gone out in 43 is currently +8 for his round and only four shots better off than Clarke, with the entire back nine still to play. Many apologies to the wonderful Clarke, but here's hoping the 2011 Open champion stays at the bottom of the pile; he can take it, but nobody wants to see a young player taking his first steps in the game suffer a shocker like this. There could be a lot of fun and games at 5 today, with the pin positioned near the water and the green sloping back towards the drink. We've already seen Kaymer and Koepka get wet here, but Chris Kirk has trumped them both. His second shot into the green bites, generating too much spin, and zips back into the creek. He drops, then hits another one in, right at the flag. The ball clatters into the flagstick - then bounces back and rolls into the drink. That's appalling luck, but the sort you can't help guffawing at. Poor Kirk was going OK at +3, but he ends up carding a triple-bogey 7 (thanks to a lovely third effort which lands softly right by the cup) and is back to +6. Shame shame shame, golfing gods, have you no shame? Yesterday, Jason Dufner ambled up to the course with a backpack, his thumbs tucked in the straps, mooching along like a student off to roll a crafty joint behind the bike sheds. Today he's got a bigger, more professional looking sports satchel over his shoulder. He now looks like a student off to roll a crafty joint behind the bike sheds, only one who's got a better bag. He's wearing shades, also. A. Another birdie for Bradley, who wedges to six feet on the par-five 4th and moves up to level par for the championship. We've been here before with Kaymer, of course, but there are scores here today for those able to locate a bit of form. Back on 1, KJ Choi is the width of the manufacturer's logo on his ball from holing his approach from 150 yards. A gorgeous iron which flirts with the overhanging branches of the trees down the left, then drops over the bunker guarding the tricky pin. He'll move to +1. So here's how quickly a fast start can go south: Kaymer follows his triple at 7 with another bogey at 6, then fails to hack out of greenside rough at 7 and cards another double. He's +3 for his round after 7, having been -3 after 4! Dearie me. No worries of Sergio losing any early momentum, though, as the silly downcast sod's had none: he hoicks his tee shot under a tree down the right, then chunks his second into the creek guarding the green. Let's say it once, while he's still vaguely relevant: Oh Sergio! From joy to pain. Young Brooks Koepka, paired with Tiger today, bumps a chip on the green from the back of 5. Like Kaymer before him, he overcooks it, sending his ball sliding across the putting surface and into the drink. He ends up with a triple-bogey 7, which follows three bogeys in the first four holes, means he's +6 for his round already, and +10 for the championship. And back to joy: another birdie for Bradley, this time at 3, and that's off the back of a near miss at 2. He's -2 for the day, and back to +1 for the championship. Eighteen years after Howard Clark makes a hole in one at the 11th at Oak Hill, his namesake Tim repeats the feat! Tim Clark, with a hybrid on the tee at 11. He arrows it straight at the flag. One bounce, a second little bounce, and it's plopped in the cup for the crispest, cleanest hole in one you'll ever see! No fuss, no messing! Clark raises an arm, wanders calmly around the tee soaking up the screams of joy from the gallery, then high-fives his caddy and finally takes the congratulations of his playing partner Miguel Angel Jimenez. The Mechanic, true to his nickname, seems to be talking Clark through the nuts and bolts of the shot, smiling broadly and gesticulating in a way which suggests he's saying \"that is the straightest golf shot I have ever seen!\" Sheer brilliance. Howard Clark's ace helped him to a one-shot victory over Peter Jacobsen in the singles of the 1995 Ryder Cup, a significant moment as Europe turned around a final-day deficit. This won't have the same seismic effect - Tim was +9 before he swung that hybrid - but he's +7 now and very happy with himself. He plucks the ball from the hole, and hands it to his caddy for safekeeping, as opposed to throwing a memory away into the crowd. What a way to start the final day, huh? Mickelson makes his par, signs for a 72, and wanders off the 18th wondering how he managed to misfire so badly all week. Perhaps it's asking too much for a man in his 40s to win two majors in a row. Hell, a sappy young thirtysomething hasn't managed that since Padraig Harrington retained the Open then lifted the PGA in 2008. Now it's the equally avuncular Darren Clarke who is in danger of propping up the entire field. He's a shot ahead of last man Woodland at present, at +12, but going backwards at the kind of rate he chugs Guinness. Four bogeys on the bounce between 9 and 12, and he needs to get his gameface on quick if he's not to end the weekend rock bottom. Such a shame after an opening-round 69, too. The opening shot is always important on the last day of a major, of course it is, but the players had better be particularly accurate today. Find the rough, and getting anywhere near the pin is probably going to be a pipe dream, as it's tucked behind a bunker at the back left. The 2011 champ Keegan Bradley finds the fairway, though, and he's able to lift a short iron over the sand and rough guarding the pin to six feet, then rattles in the birdie. He's up to +2 now. No early face-saving charge from Tiger, who remains at +4 after four workaday pars. Mickelson clatters his approach at 18 pin high, the sort of shot each and every one of the leaders would take right now to store in the bank for later. And Kaymer registers a triple bogey 7 on 5, so bang goes all that early work. Twenty majors between them, and look. Golf in a nutshell, folks, why we love and hate both it and ourselves in equal measure. So much for Kaymer's fast start: at the side of 5, he's fizzed a very heavy-handed chip straight through the green and into the water. Shots out the window there. Meanwhile right down at the bottom of the leaderboard, the Open champion Phil Mickelson is making a brave attempt of ensuring he doesn't go from first on the final day of a major to last. He was out in 39 strokes, including a triple bogey at 5 and yet another double at 7, but birdies at 11 and 13 have taken him up to +12, a shot better than Gary Woodland, who is in the clubhouse today after a level-par 70, yesterday's 80 having done all his damage. Lefty's got one hole to go: a par, and at least he's not rock bottom. Still, what a weird display by Mickelson this week, who has carded four double bogeys and two triples this week. The wind is much less of a factor than yesterday, it seems. For early proof, look to Martin Kaymer, who shot an awful 78 yesterday to play himself out of contention, dropping from -4 to +4. But he's flown out of the traps today. After birdieing the opening hole, he's picked up another at the par-three 3rd, and now he's rolled in a ten-foot birdie effort on the par-five 4th. He's back up to +1. So, perhaps there are scores out there after all? If the leading pair of Furyk and Dufner misfire, and come back into the pack, quite a few players will fancy their chances. With two Swedes in the top four, Scandinavia could have its first-ever major winner tonight. Stenson is the form horse, the more experienced player, and the bookies favourite. But major winners need a little bit of luck as well as a shedload of talent, and there was perhaps some evidence yesterday that the golfing gods are smiling on Jonas Blixt in only his second major. \"Did you see that Blixt drove straight into the pocket of a spectator yesterday on the 18th?\" asks Per Olsson. \"Fortunately (for the spectator) he didn't have to play it from there, but got a free drop, and managed to hit it to three feet.\" Yes sir, that really was something else. What are the chances, eh? Not only that, Blixt benefitted from a huge slice of luck with the resulting approach: he admits he pushed it a wee bit to the right, needlessly dicing with the bunker guarding the pin. Instead of finding sand, the ball just made it over the trap, hit the downslope of the bank, and rolled next to the cup, from where he made birdie. Still, as the great Gary Player once pointed out, the more these dudes practice, the luckier they seem to get. And karma may shine some more on Blixt today, too, as he gave Rochester resident Muhammad Khokhar a signed glove by way of apology and thanks - and you know how the gods like it if you spread this much happiness... It's only the week's stragglers out and about at present, so value judgements aren't worth much, but there are no early signs that the course is offering anything for free. There are 25 players out there so far, and only seven are under par. Mind you, DA Points has birdied the first two holes, while Martin Kaymer has picked up a shot on the opening hole too. All of this means nothing. I'll level with you, I'm wittering. Ian Poulter isn't one for pars during the final round of the PGA. Last year he made a charge at Rory McIlroy, with five birdies in the first five holes, and eventually made it -6 for the day before dropping four shots in the last five to settle for a two-under 69. Well, he's at it again today: four birdies in the first six holes, followed by three bogeys and a birdie over the next four. After a blistering start, -4 for his round at one point and then reaching the turn in three-under 32, he's only -2 now through 10. Makes little difference after yesterday's 77, but Poulter - who stormed up the final-round leaderboard at Muirfield last month, too - needs to work out how to position himself better going into the last day. If he can, he'll become very dangerous: few like a final-day birdie blitz like Poults. Today's weather. According to those in the know .... well, we have no information there. The weather forecasters, however, those folk who told us there would be an hour, tops, of rain on Friday, reckon it's going to be another sunny day at Oak Hill. There might be a wee bit less wind, which caused the players plenty of gyp yesterday, but some breeze is still expected. Scoring will depend on where the pins are situated, and with Oak Hill's honour to defend after the first two days of 63s, 64s and 65s, they'll not be in particularly accessible spots. This should be fun. Anyway, here's how the top of the leaderboard looks going into the final round, as the player's prepare to take a tilt at Glory's Last Shot: -9: Furyk -8: Dufner -7: Stenson -6: Blixt -5: Stricker, Scott -3: McIlroy, Westwood -2: D Johnson, Streelman, Castro -1: Warren, Toms, Z Johnson, Haas, Lynn, Hoffman, Simpson, Garrigus, Kuchar If the first three rounds are anything to go by, there's going to be plenty of movement on that today. One thing, however, is certain to remain constant ... Poor old Jim Furyk hasn't been blessed with one of the game's prettier swings. \"Like an octopus falling out of a tree,\" the renowned stand-up comedian and one-time tour pro David Feherty once noted. Cruel but true: Furyk's rococo stylings - backlift like a music teacher drawing a treble clef on a blackboard, the followthrough of a cook trying to tease a meringue into a peak - won't be bothering Fred Couples for any aesthetic awards. But the man gets the job done. What the strange looping action - \"Wow, it doesn't feel like that!\" he said upon viewing it on videotape for the first time - loses Furyk in length, it gains its owner in accuracy. And accuracy has been at a premium this week, on a course that offered up low scores over the first two days, then bared its teeth yesterday when the wind picked up and the pins were tucked away. Furyk's 68 yesterday was a case study in steady brilliance from tee to green - as well as top-class putting and scrambling. The whole kit and caboodle. He regained his place at the top of the leaderboard in a calm and measured fashion, as other renowned steady-eddies were crumbling around him: Justin Rose shot 77, for example, while Martin Kaymer crumbled to a 78. A decade after landing his US Open, Furyk looks in good shape to claim his second major. Much depends, mind, on his ability to conquer the demons of last year's US Open, which he led deep into the final round only to capitulate spectacularly, a defeat that scarred him awhile. He may gain succour in the knowledge that others challenging Furyk for the 95th PGA Championship have their own demons to slay: Jason Dufner's horror show over the closing holes of the 2011 PGA; Adam Scott's occasional travails with the flat stick; Lee Westwood and Steve Stricker's increasingly desperate attempts to land that elusive major; Rory McIlroy's dismal year; Dustin Johnson's myriad major meltdowns. The big worry for Furyk - given that the resurgent defending champ is probably just a bit too far out of reach, six shots behind the lead - may be the Swedish pairing in the penultimate game. Ice-cool, as we are contractually bound to describe Scandinavians according to our Big Book of Bone-Idle Journalism, neither Henrik Stenson nor Jonas Blixt succumbed to the pressure or the course yesterday. Stenson is due a big one after good shows in all three majors this season, and is in top form, while Blixt barely blinked when asked by the man from the Sky Telecast Company if his putter was his secret weapon. \"Yes,\" was his matter-of-fact response. And then, when he realised the interviewer expected a bit more, he added: \"I am good with it.\" Competing in only his second major, will Blixt become the second leftfield PGA winner in a row at Oak Hill, after Shaun Micheel?
