Not so this year, as a scrappy, imperfect competition drew to a close in Wellington, with the NZ All Blacks knocking all the promise out of the Wallabies in the dead-rubber contest to avoid bottom place. South Africa were clear winners of the annual tournament, but every ounce has been wrung out of the three-way contest and the arrival of a fourth participant cannot come soon enough. Argentina will not be welcomed for a couple of seasons \u2013 and they will not automatically arrive as liberators, being disciples of the brutal school of rugby thinking \u2013 but they will, at least, give a coherent shape to the Four Nations. A straightforward format of home and away games between four will put an end to the supplementary third fixture between the three. The Springboks won this year, fair and square, but their cause was helped by an opening run of three home Tests, two against the All Blacks in Bloemfontein and Durban. For progress over our summer, only the Lions could claim to be at the cutting edge. Jamie Roberts and Brian O'Driscoll, and even Riki Flutey and Tommy Bowe, were combinations that elevated guile above brutishness, the quest for space above contact. The Springboks responded to the threat of the Lions with a game of resilience, directness from set-piece and an absolute refusal to lose the mind games. For the Tri Nations, the Springboks reduced their exposure to risk even more, relying on their excellent line-out, their outstanding work at the breakdown and a game of kick, chase and tackle, with an unswerving dedication to the last of the three. It wasn't pretty, but the fanaticism of their tackling had to be admired and they set a new record for height reached with every punt of the ball, whatever the altitude. It used to be thought that only at 6,000 feet, on the Highveld, were there atmospheric advantages when it came to the flight of a rugby ball, but it seems the Steyn boys, Francois and Morne can drill through thick air as well as thin. So clear was the superiority of South Africa that it is tempting to select them en bloc for any Tri Nations dream team. That would mean putting Heinrich Br\u00fcssow above Richie McCaw on the open side of the back row. Brilliant as Br\u00fcssow was, I don't think he can yet take over from one of the best wing forwards of all time, but it is a tribute to this year's newcomer that he demanded pause for thought. Having included one All Black in the back row, I'm going to insert two more. It's always easy to go thoroughly Kiwi when it comes to 6, 7 and 8, such has been their expertise there over the years. But it's a question of balance as well as bloodline and there was something very joined-up about the combination of McCaw, Adam Thomson and Kieran Read against Australia. Thomson was revealed to Europe as an open-side wing forward, but has settled back into the blind-side role. He has the appropriately unkempt look of somebody who lurks in dark places, but is more than simply a beast of the night, being athletic at the line-out and comfortable on the ball. Read is the middle-man at No8, industrious at the base of the scrum and agile for a lump. As for McCaw, he does what his colleagues do, plus a whole heap of other things, the most obvious element being his magnetic pull on the ball. Wherever he parks himself, it comes his way. He is the perfect purveyor of inspiration to his own and an irritation to his opponents. Other All Blacks, even in a season of travails at the line-out and criticism, by the train-load, of the coaching staff of Graham Henry, Wayne Smith and Steve Hansen, force their way in. Daniel Carter has been far from his best, but still plays. He was clattered in a tackle by George Smith in the last game and took his eyes off a routine catch, but he emerged unharmed by the hit and unflustered by the knock-on, tougher of torso than he looks and harder of head. Outside Carter goes Ma'a Nonu, who couldn't possibly be any tougher than he looks or he'd be serving a life sentence for intimidation against humanity. But Nonu has a sweet touch beneath his cast-iron dreadlocks and I think he'd enjoy life alongside Jacque Fourie, although their cocktail of testosterone might turn into a Molotov. On the wing, there is Cory Jane, just to dilute the hormones. Jane was exceptional against Australia, wide-angled with his vision and yet pin-point focused on the ball in the air. At prop, Tony Woodcock takes his place on the loose-head. Australia disrupted the much-vaunted Springboks in the scrum, only to suffer against the All Blacks, but the overall impression of the set-piece in the Tri Nations was that it was a right old mess. The most solid scrum of the summer was set by Adam Jones, Matthew Rees and Gethin Jenkins, perhaps the first time in 30 years that Wales have led the pushing world. Everyone else is South African, from the experts at picking off the line-out, Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha, to the master of picking off passes, Bryan Habana. John Smit is there as captain, part of the scrummaging mess, but as coherent a leader as the game has produced. Australia have nobody in the team, although the nagging feeling persists that they are building more encouragingly towards the World Cup of 2011 than the others. Anyway, the composite team will never play together. On the other hand, the Tri Nations teams, plus the fourth, Argentina, are coming our way soon. Then we'll really find out about the relative strengths of the hemispheres."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
