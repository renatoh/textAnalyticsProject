Seven months after a group of local businessmen headed by the insolvency specialist Gerald Krasner took over the former Premiership club to alleviate the \u00a3100m debt, Leeds are still burdened by liabilities of more than \u00a330m. With the Thorp Arch training ground sold for a reported \u00a34.2m and leased back to the club, Leeds sources indicate the club are preparing to cash in and lease back the stadium - their last saleable asset - as an alternative to Sainsbury's bid. \"Mr Sainsbury has been involved for at least a week,\" said a source. \"There is a strategy if we do not do a deal with them, and one part of that strategy is selling the ground.\" The board last night stalled on the Sainsbury offer, ostensibly to await proof of funding. \"The board of Leeds United confirms that a number of discussions are continuing with various parties, and at this stage no agreement has been signed,\" said Krasner. \"We have always insisted that any interested party must be able to confirm that the necessary funds are available in order to complete any transaction.\" There was fresh mortgage activity at the stadium-holding company Elland Road Ltd, filed with Companies House on Saturday, though its exact nature is not yet clear. Krasner, who used a \u00a315m loan from the property developer Jack Petchey's firm Trefick to facilitate the March takeover, downplayed the new declarations: \"Maybe it is a remortgage from the same people; no new mortgages have been granted to my knowledge.\" The impasse came as a shock to Sainsbury, who heads an Anglo-American consortium also involving the Tampa-based former telecom executive Burl Sheppard. \"On Tuesday morning at 9.30am we made a submission that was agreed in front of counsel with Melvyn Levi [a Leeds director] and Gerald Krasner,\" said Sainsbury. \"[The deal indicated] that they would sign a letter of intent to sell on Wednesday, at which point they would receive a \u00a3500,000 non-refundable deposit and \u00a32m on Friday morning with the balance of \u00a322.5m next Friday. \"I said to Krasner that if the money wasn't there by the time specified they can tear up their letter of intent. Where was the risk for them?\" Observers might question why Sainsbury's consortium would consider so risky an investment as one in a club positioned 17th in the Championship. But Sainsbury, who owns a Knightsbridge bar reputedly attended by Prince William, is sure he can engineer a return from the club. \"Leeds are one of the greatest names in English football. That really excites me and we want to build on other projects round it,\" he said. \"We want to follow some of the projects they are working on such as the casino.\" The \u00a35m sale of a pocket of land on the Elland Road site to Stanley Leisure, to be developed as a leisure complex and casino, particularly interests the transatlantic investors. \"They see it as a sound base to build a European business,\" said Sainsbury. \"We all love a brand and the brand of Leeds, there are few better. But making money is our objective.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
