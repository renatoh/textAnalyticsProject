Investors pushed stocks up, following gains in Europe, as they welcomed the latest stimulus moves from the Bank of England (see here) and the European Central Bank (see here). Hopes that Congress would pass a trillion dollar stimulus package to protect American business and families (that could include $1,000 checks for households) also provided some support. But there\u2019s still a LOT of anxiety out there, of course. So, for once, we have a fairly gentle rally - a welcome change after nearly a month of turmoil Here are the closing prices. Dow: up 188 points or 0.95% to 20,088 S&amp;P 500: up 11.2 points or 0.47% at 2,409 Nasdaq: up 160 points or 2.3% at 7,150 We\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning, to cover the next twists and turns in the markets. Goodnight! GW, AM and JJ. President Donald Trump has also suggested he\u2019d be amenable to blocking companies that receive federal assistance during the coronavirus pandemic from conducting stock buybacks. He told today\u2019s press conference: \u201cIt takes many many people in this case to tango, but as far as I\u2019m concerned conditions like that would be okay with me.\u201d This is a hot topic -- yesterday, The Guardian calculated that America\u2019s five largest airlines have paid more than $45bn to shareholders and executives over the last five years. Now they want a $50bn+ bailout.... Leading Democrat Elizabeth Warren reckons firms can be kept in check: Over in Washington, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been outlining the White House\u2019s stimulus plans. It would apparently include sending $1,000 checks to most adults and $500 for each child, to help families handle the economic slowdown as the U.S. seeks to contain the coronavirus epidemic. In an interview with Fox Business, Mnuchin urged Congress to pass a massive financial aid package that includes direct payments to families as quickly as possible. Our US politics blog has all the latest: More on Norway\u2019s plans to help its airlines.... With Italy falling deeper into the covonavirus crisis each day, the country\u2019s prime minister is urging the EU use \u201cthe full firepower\u201d of its \u20ac500bn rescue fund to support its members. Giuseppe Conte told the Financial Times it was time for the European Stability Mechanism to offer emergency credit lines to countries reeling from the pandemic. He also warned that monetary policy alone cannot counter a \u201cglobal shock that has no precedents\u201d. \u201cMonetary policy alone cannot solve all problems; we need to do the same on the fiscal front and, as I already mentioned, time is of the essence, \u201cThe route to follow is to open ESM credit lines to all member states to help them fight the consequences of the Covid-19 epidemic.\u201d There are some crazy moves in the oil market tonight. US crude has closed 25% higher tonight, up $5 per barrel at $25.41, as prices surged back from Wednesday\u2019s slump to a 17-year low. Reports are coming in that Norway\u2019s government is drawing up a credit guarantee package for its airlines, worth 6 billion Krona (\u00a3460m). The plan could provide a 3bn crown lifeline for Norwegian Air, but only if it can raise some funding itself: Reuters has more details: Norway will back airlines with credit guarantees worth up to 6 billion Norwegian crowns in a bid to stave off collapse in the industry amid the coronavirus crisis, the government said on Thursday. Norwegian Air, which has grounded most of its aircraft and will temporarily lay off 90% of staff, can get up to 3 billion crowns, but must boost its equity to get the full amount, Industry Minister Iselin Nyboe told a news conference. Stocks are rallying harder in New York, with the Nasdaq now 5% higher. Traders are weighing up the latest central bank interventions from the BoE, the ECB and the Fed - and perhaps wondering if the worst of the market mayhem is over. Mind you, a 5% jump doesn\u2019t even recover all of Wednesday\u2019s rout. And with massive swings up and down virtually a daily event, there\u2019s surely more volatility ahead.... RBC Capital Markets reckon the Bank of England was forced to expand its QE (bond-buying) programme because UK government bond prices started falling (pushing interest rates/yields up). For the market, we think this package should go a long way in compressing Gilt yields. In line with other \u2018risk free\u2019 markets around the globe, Gilt yields rose over the last weeks, sending both nominal and, probably more important, real yields up. This clearly is not acceptable to a central bank that tries to help cushion the blow of an unprecedented economic crisis. Hence, today\u2019s announcement, together with the ECB\u2019s substantial package and the forthcoming purchases from other central banks in their respective markets.... Capital Economics reckon the Bank of England may have to take even more dramatic measures at its scheduled meeting next week. They point out that today\u2019s shock interest rate cut, alongside a massive dose of QE, hasn\u2019t had much impact on the bond market yet. The big package of measures announced by the Bank of England today in its second emergency meeting in just over a week is designed to ease the stress in the financial markets and to support the recovery once the full economic hit from the coronavirus has been felt. So far it has only reduced gilt yields by 10-15 basis points, so the Bank may have to do even more at its next meeting on Thursday 26th March. That could potentially include tweaking the QE programme, to buy enough government bonds to keep 10-year gilt yields close to 0%, for example. Frankly it\u2019ll be a change to get a BoE decision at the appointed hour, after two emergency moves in just over a week! Over in Westminster, Boris Johnson has said companies should \u201cthink very carefully\u201d before they lay off their staff. He also told the daily Covid-19 briefing that government will support business, and businesses should support their workers. He says he thinks the government will have a \u201cgreat package\u201d on this. Rishi Sunak will say more tomorrow, he says. Our main coronavirus blog has all the details: IKEA have got in touch with more details of their store closure plan (see earlier post): Those able to perform their roles from home are doing so. Our online fulfillment operations and customer contact centre are still in operation. Those store workers who are fit and healthy are being asked to come in to into work when stores are shut to the public and we\u2019ll work together to define how we best support our customers and communities. Those self-isolating in line with government guidelines are being paid. Stocks are still higher on the New York stock exchange - but there aren\u2019t so many people there to see it. The NYSE looks a little quieter than usual, after two traders tested positive for Covid-19. Yesterday, the exchange said it will close its physical trading floor on Monday, March 23, and move to a fully electronic trading system. \u201cThey\u2019re finally shutting it down,\u201d one NYSE insider told The New York Post. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief, to be honest.\u201d Right now, the Dow is up 294 points or 1.4% at 20,192 points, with around two hours trading to go. Lufthansa Group has announced it will allow its staff to volunteer as medics to combat the coronavirus crisis. The move comes after Lufthansa confirmed the grounding of most of its fleets earlier today, and said that the future of the aviation industry could not be guaranteed without state aid. The airline said its medically trained staff would still be paid by Lufthansa. The airline also extended its rebooking period for passengers with grounded flights until the end of the summer, with a \u20ac50 on subsequent bookings, in an effort to retain revenues during at least two months of virtual standstill. The coronavirus has had a devastating impact on demand for cruises.... so Carnival has an idea -- use its ships as temporary hospitals. Marketwatch has the details: The cruise ship operator said it would only ask interested parties to cover the essential costs of the ship\u2019s operations while in port. \u201cWith the continued spread of COVID-19 expected to exert added pressure on land-based healthcare facilities, including a possible shortage of hospital beds, Carnival Corporation and its brands are calling on governments and health authorities to consider using cruise ships as temporary healthcare facilities to treat non-COVID-19 patients, freeing up additional space and expanding capacity in land-based hospitals to treat cases of COVID-19,\u201d Carnival said in a statement. The stock, which rose 7.5% in afternoon trading, has plunged 77% over the past month, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX, 0.804% has lost 28.4%. Two of Carnival\u2019s Princess ships have already been in the frontline of the battle against Covid-19, after passengers tested positive for the virus. Last week it suspended all sailings, so its ships are currently idle..... and authorities do need plenty of beds for patients.... As we\u2019ve become used to recently, there were some wild swings on the FTSE 100 today. Investment manager M&amp;G jumped by 34%, which largely reverses three days of heavy losses. Cruise operator Carnival and holiday firm TUI made a rare appearance in the top FTSE risers too, both gaining almost 19%. But British Airways owner, IAG, lost another 9%. Sector-wise, telecoms, energy, consumer goods makers and healthcare firms generally rose, while miners and utilities dipped. The smaller FTSE 250 index had another rough day, though, finishing 1.4% lower at 12,829 points. That\u2019s its lowest level since early 2013, as the Covid-19 crisis has driven down the value of many smaller UK firms, quite dramatically: There will be some relief for investors and policymakers as the FTSE 100 and other major European markets close higher. Here are the closing scores: FTSE 100: +1.4% (71 points) at 5,152 Germany\u2019s Dax: +2% at 8,610 France\u2019s Cac 40: +2.7% at 3,855 Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib: +2.3% at 15,467 Spain\u2019s Ibex: +1.9% at 6,396 Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600: +2.9% at 288 Andrew Bailey, the new Bank of England governor, has commented on the decision today to cut rates to 0.1% and pump \u00a3200bn into the economy through bond purchases. My colleague Phillip Inman reports: Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said the central bank moved quickly to calm markets spooked by rumours that London would be forced into complete lockdown with a few days. \u201cYou could see that reflected in the rising value of the dollar, in bond yields and in bond spreads,\u201d he said. \u201cThe obvious increase in the pace and severity of Covid-19, which has built during the week, was something we had to assess and respond to, we can\u2019t wait for the hard economic data before we act,\u201d he added. Bailey said he would use the extra \u00a3200bn of quantitative easing funding to act in the markets promptly, adding that all central banks were moving in the same direction. \u201cI talk to central bank governors most days and while we make decisions with reference to our own mandates, it is not a surprise that we all are coming to the same conclusion [over what to do].\u201d The mood on Wall Street appears relatively upbeat as the major indices extend gains: The Dow Jones is up 1.2% or 229 points at 20,128 The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.7% or 17 points at 2,415 The Nasdaq is up 2% or 152 points at 7,157 Investors have been encouraged by the Fed\u2019s action to cut rates and providing billions of dollars of cheap credit, and by President Trump\u2019s message that there are Covid-19 therapies in development that could be rolled out quickly. Here is our full story on the Bank of England\u2019s latest emergency interest rate cut: Here is the statement from Ikea about plans to close stores in response to the coronavirus pandemic: These are extraordinary times &amp; our absolute priority is to ensure the health &amp; safety of our customers &amp; co-workers. As a precautionary measure against the ongoing risk of COVID-19, we will temporarily close all UK &amp; Ireland stores to customers on 20th March, 6pm. You will continue to be able to browse and purchase our range online or through the app, and have our products delivered directly to you. You will also be able to request a contact-free delivery if you prefer. You will continue to be able to browse and purchase our range online or through the app, and have our products delivered directly to you. You will also be able to request a contact-free delivery if you prefer. For people with pre-booked kitchen planning appointments, we will be in touch to discuss virtual or remote planning options. Co-workers are at the heart of the IKEA business and we are committed to supporting them in the best possible way during this complex and fast-evolving situation. We would like to thank our co-workers and partners for their dedication and hard work through these unprecedented times. We look forward to welcoming you back to our stores soon and we thank you for your understanding during these extraordinary circumstances. Ikea will close all its stores in the UK and Ireland from 6pm tomorrow, Ashley Armstrong from The Times reports: M&amp;S is closing its cafes and and clothing fitting rooms so that 4,600 staff can shift to its food business to help keep shelves stocked. The retailer is also bringing in temporary purchasing restrictions of two items per customer on frozen foods, homecare, groceries and eggs. In addition it will be reserving the first hour of trading for the elderly and vulnerable on Mondays and Thursdays with a special one off tomorrow, Friday 20 March. NHS and emergency support workers will also have a reserved shopping hour on Tuesday and Friday mornings. Meanwhile, the grim corporate news keeps flowing. My colleague Gwyn Topham brings this report: Iberia, British Airway\u2019s sister airline in International Airlines Group, has proposed laying off 90% of its airline staff for three months, the company said on Thursday, in response to the coronavirus crisis. The plans would have to be agreed by labour authorities in Spain, Iberia said. It comes three days after IAG said it would cut capacity by 75% across the group for the next two months. Iberia\u2019s boss Luis Gallego - who presided over widespread redundancies and cost cutting when he first took over as chief executive - is staying on to run the Spanish airline through the crisis, instead of succeeding Willie Walsh at the helm of IAG. The pound and the FTSE 100 are reaping the benefit of the Bank of England\u2019s decision to cut interest rates for the second time in a week. The pound is up 2.8% against the euro at \u20ac1.0933 and up 1.3% against the dollar at $1.1772. The FTSE 100 is 1.3% or 65 points higher on the day at 5,147. The latest emergency rate cut from the Bank of England has been well received so far by the markets and by analysts. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says the Bank is \u201cright to throw everything at this\u201d. He says: Britain is now a whisker away from the negative interest rate club. Rates have never been this low in the more than 300-year history of the Bank of England. Purchases of government and corporate bonds have been ramped up. A desperate measure for a desperate situation. Both governments and central banks have quickly acknowledged that we face a sharp downturn. The question now is whether the Bank\u2019s assumption that the hit will be temporary is correct. It could be. The infrastructure of global supply remains in place and global demand should bounce back quickly once the outbreak passes. Attention now shifts to the US. If this becomes the new epicentre then we can expect a further leg down for financial markets but if the outbreak can be contained and monetary and fiscal measures take effect at pace then there is scope for a stabilisation. The Bank is right to throw everything at this. The Bank\u2019s decision to cut rates and pump more stimulus into the economy is a clear indication that UK policymakers are ready to make coordinated efforts to support the economy. That\u2019s according to Ivan Petrella, associate professor of economics at Warwick Business School. He adds: The fact that the Bank of England is ready to step up its efforts to stimulate the economy gives the UK a clear advantage over countries in the EU. It is now clear that the prolonged impact of a shut-down to the economy, coupled with the large fall in demand and related uncertainty, will most likely lead to a severe downturn unless we see more drastic and decisive policy actions. That will most likely lead to a massive credit crunch for large sectors of the economy. So far, the government has put forward a fiscal package of a similar size to other European countries to support businesses, but it falls short of direct support to jobs. This is most likely the area where the government will have to intervene in the coming weeks if it aims at prevent a wave of lay-offs. The emergency rate cut is the Bank of England\u2019s second in a little more than a week, and is the latest move as policymakers at both Threadneedle Street and the Treasury attempt to limit the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic. After the Bank announced the latest cut, the chancellor Rishi Sunak reiterated his pledge that he is prepared to take \u201cwhatever action is necessary\u201d during the crisis. Sunak is under mounting pressure to do more to support workers facing layoffs following the coronavirus outbreak. The coronavirus pandemic has truly moved UK economic policy into uncharted territory with that emergency rate cut. The rate cut takes the Bank of England the lowest it can feasibly go, said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at payments company Equals Group. New governor Andrew Bailey may have to hand over to chancellor Rishi Sunak now, he added. Another day, another rate cut by the Bank of England. The base rate is now at the lowest level we think the Bank of England is prepared to go to and with that will come a not so unsubtle hand-off of the stimulus baton to the Treasury. Lower rates and additional quantitative easing can keep markets satisfied and borrowing costs for both businesses and the government down but unless money is forced into the hands of small businesses soon, then it will be for nothing; they are the ones laying off staff due to a liquidity shock. Sterling is higher on the day following the announcement having endured its fifth worst day of the century against the USD yesterday. Sterling is now flying against the euro. It\u2019s up by 1.8% for the day, hitting highs above \u20ac1.0839 - althought that still remains short of levels hit just yesterday when the pound slumped. The Bank of England\u2019s move has boosted demand for UK government bonds. Yields, which move inversely to prices, have fallen. From Reuters: Yields on British government bonds, known as gilts, fell sharply after the BoE move. Two-year gilt yields were last down 15 basis points [0.15 percentage points] on the day at around 0.19%, while 10-year gilt yields were almost 4 bps lower at 0.76% reversing earlier rises. The FTSE 100 is now gaining: it\u2019s up by 0.6% for the day. Sterling is up by 0.4% against the US dollar. The quantitative easing purchaes will focus on UK government bonds, the Bank said: The majority of additional asset purchases will comprise UK government bonds. The purchases announced today will be completed as soon as is operationally possible, consistent with improved market functioning. The Bank will issue further guidance to the market in due course. The rate cut takes the Bank of England\u2019s base rate to its lowest in history, at 0.1%. The Bank also announced another \u00a3200bn in bond buying under the quantitative easing programme, and the extension of the term funding scheme, which encourages banks to pass on the benefits of interest rate cuts to companies and households. The unscheduled meeting of the monetary policy committee was only held today. The Bank says the cut has come in response to tightening financial conditions. Over recent days, and in common with a number of other advanced economy bond markets, conditions in the UK gilt market have deteriorated as investors have sought shorter-dated instruments that are closer substitutes for highly liquid central bank reserves. As a consequence, UK and global financial conditions have tightened. Here is the link to the Bank of England\u2019s full statement. The Bank of England has cut interest rates to 0.1%, in a second emergency cut prompted by the coronavirus outbreak. This is from the statement just published: At its special meeting on 19 March, the MPC judged that a further package of measures was warranted to meet its statutory objectives. It therefore voted unanimously to increase the Bank of England\u2019s holdings of UK government bonds and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bonds by \u00a3200 billion to a total of \u00a3645 billion, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, and to reduce Bank Rate by 15 basis points to 0.1%. The Committee also voted unanimously that the Bank of England should enlarge the TFSME scheme, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. More to come... Newsflash: US stock market indices have staged a reversal, and all three major indices are now positive for the day. The S&amp;P 500 is now up by 0.6% for the day. The FTSE 100 is still down by 0.6%, at about 5,046 points. That move represents a recovery from earlier\u2019s move down, however. France\u2019s Cac 40 is about flat, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up by 0.8%. US carmaker Ford has drawn down $15.4bn (\u00a313bn) of cash from two credit lines as it looks for to build buffers for coronavirus disruption. The company has also suspended its dividend and offered payment holidays to new customers. Ford said it will use the extra cash to address \u201ctemporary working capital impacts of the coronavirus-related production shut downs and to preserve Ford\u2019s financial flexibility\u201d. Ford chief executive Jim Hackett said: While we obviously didn\u2019t foresee the coronavirus pandemic, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity so that we could weather economic uncertainty and continue to invest in our future. Our Ford people are extremely resilient and motivated, and I\u2019m confident in the actions we are taking to navigate the current uncertainty while continuing to build toward the future. The interventions of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have not stopped Wall Street from falling back at the opening bell. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average have both lost 1% in early trades. The US Federal Reserve has announced that it will give access to $450bn in dollar swap lines to nine central banks - extending the use of instruments that played a key role in fighting the financial crisis a year ago. Demand for US dollars has become heightened in recent days as companies and investors look to build up cash buffers to ride out the coronavirus crisis. That has strained currency and bond markets. The swap lines will allow other central banks to get access to dollars. $60bn each will be available for the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Banco Central do Brasil, the Bank of Korea, the Banco de Mexico, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Sveriges Riksbank and $30bn each for Denmark\u2019s Nationalbank, Norway\u2019s Norges Bank, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The Fed said: These facilities, like those already established between the Federal Reserve and other central banks, are designed to help lessen strains in global US dollar funding markets, thereby mitigating the effects of these strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses, both domestically and abroad. The Bank of England already has a swap line set up, as do the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. Another retail update from the Guardian\u2019s Joanna Partridge, this time on pharmacy chain Superdrug. CK Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate which owns the high-street chain Superdrug, expects Superdrug and other health and beauty stores in western Europe to remain open during the coronavirus outbreak because they have a pharmacy format. The group said shops in its western Europe retail division, which includes the UK, discount health and beauty retailer Savers, and brands in the Netherlands, Poland and Germany, have experienced \u201cdouble-digit sales growth\u201d. The group\u2019s co-managing director, Canning Fok Kin-ning, wrote in the company\u2019s 2019 financial results: We are in \u201cmass essential\u201d business selling high demand products, such as hand sanitisers, personal wash, vitamins and other health lines and also household cleaning. CK Hutchison, which also has ports, infrastructure and telecommunications divisions, warned of a \u201cvery challenging\u201d trading environment during 2020, and said it could not currently estimate the financial impact of Covid-19 on its business. Clarks has closed all its own stores in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The company said all store employees would continue to receive pay and benefits during the temporary closure. In a statement Clarks said: We will continue to monitor the situation and will be reviewing the decision of when to re-open our stores when the health and wellbeing of our employees and customers can be protected. The number of people claiming for unemployment in the US has jumped much more than economists had projected, in a sign of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the workforce. Claims for US unemployment benefits rose more than expected to 281,000 in the latest week ending 14 March, from an unrevised 211,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 220,000. The Guardian\u2019s US business editor, Dominic Rushe, writes that it offers \u201cthe first official snapshot of the likely Covid-19 recession\u201d. The hotel chain Marriott, retailer Macy\u2019s and others have laid off thousands of staff this week, so we can expect to see that number rise sharply in the weeks ahead. Note that this chart below does not run to zero on the y axis, but it\u2019s nevertheless illustrative of the pace of the turnaround. Numbers like this could prompt US Congress to get behind stimulus efforts, although there had been fears that the figure would be much worst. Claims in Connecticut have soared. Some 10,000 claims were filed Monday and nearly 12,000 more came on Tuesday, bringing the number to 30,000 since Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d deputy commissioner Daryle Dudzinski, who has been at the Labor Department since 1992, told the Hartford Courant. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Waitrose is closing all its cafes and rotisseries and temporarily suspending making coffees as it joins other supermarkets in tightening restrictions on purchases, writes retail correspondent Sarah Butler. From today, shoppers are limited to three items of any specific grocery and a maximum of two packets of toilet roll per customer in shops. At the same time, Waitrose has set up a \u00a31m community support fund which staff in local stores can use to develop services such as local deliveries for the self-isolating, the vulnerable, the elderly or boxes of staples to local care homes and community groups. Waitrose is also joining other supermarkets in allocating the first hour after opening as dedicated to the elderly, the vulnerable and those who look after them. Next is leading the FTSE 100 risers during a bumpy day - it\u2019s still up by 12%. Investment group 3i has also gained 12%. It warned that its brands Action, BoConcept and Hans Anders in the retail sector, and Audley Travel and ICE in the travel space could be affected by the outbreak, but said the disruption would be modest. The biggest riser on the FTSE 350 today is Elementis, a chemicals business, whose market value appears to have doubled after it said it had secured a relaxation of its banking convenants. Easyjet is the biggest FTSE 100 faller, down by 14.5%. Melrose, the takeover specialist, has lost 13.8%. Germany is to be plunged into recession due to the global health crisis, German economists have said this morning, writes the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent, Kate Connolly. Economists from the German Institute for Economic Research, the DIW, and the Munich-based Ifo Institut, which measures business climate, have both said a recession is \u201cunavoidable\u201d. \u201cThe German economy is certain to plunge into a recession,\u201d DIW\u2019s head of forecasting and economic policy, Claus Michelsen said. He said it was impossible to predict exactly how the recession would develop. Two scenarios are possible. Either a \u2018V\u2019, that is to say a quick recovery effect for production and consumption after a rapid collapse, just as was the case with other epidemics, such as Sars, the swine and bird flus. That would lead GDP to shrink by around 0.1%. But it was more likely to be an \u2018L\u2019 shaped recession, in which after a collapse there was little recovery and consumption and production remained low, he added. \u201cIn which case, a recession would be much harsher.\u201d He said he could not be more specific than that. Ifo\u2019s business climate index sank to 87.7 points, compared to 96 points last month. Clemens Fuerst, Ifo\u2019s president, said: \u201cThe expectations of companies in the coming months are darkening like never before.\u201d The German government has announced its next tranche of economic help, this time for the self-employed and other small companies, confirming that \u20ac50bn would be set aside to help them. It is not yet clear how those monetary injections will be administered. As we approach midday in London, here\u2019s a recap of market moves in the wake of the European Central Bank\u2019s \u201cno limits\u201d stimulus package. The FTSE 100 gave up early gains to fall by 2.2%. Germany\u2019s Dax fell by 1.4%; France\u2019s Cac 40 also turned negative, with a loss of 1.5% despite what appeared to be strong gains in morning trading. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was still up for the day, gaining 1.3%. The pound lost 0.5% against the US dollar, hovering near lows last seen in 1985. However, the pound gained 1% against the euro. The US dollar index, measuring the strength of the currency against a trade-weighted basket, rose to highs of 102.329 - the strongest since January 2017. Brent crude oil futures prices rose by 4.7%, but remained near historically weak levels just above $26 per barrel. Futures for West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, rose 10% to $22 per barrel. Government bond yields have risen, in sign that investors are looking for cash. Investors are looking anywhere they can to get cash, which is impacting the market even for government debt - usually seen as a safe haven. The yield on 10-year UK government bonds has risen by 0.12 percentage points today to 0.91%. Yields move inversely to prices, so a rising yield means investors are selling more bonds. This is a reversal of moves in recent weeks, which saw the relative safety of government debt in high demand. At a certain point, however, cash becomes king, and investors have to sell those assets for which it is easiest to find buyers - a phenomenon known as forced selling. (The prospect of a major expansion of government spending may also have caused some investors to question whether the nation\u2019s debt pile could become unmanageable. Although the evidence of the last decade of quantitative easing does not appear to suggest that this is the biggest risk.) This is the yield on the 10-year gilt over the last year. The hunt for dollars is also evident in the currency markets (perhaps unsurprisingly). The euro has lost 1.4% against the US dollar today, hitting its lowest since spring 2017: $1.0703. Sterling is down by 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.156. Britain\u2019s manufacturing industry lobby group has called for an immediate deferment of VAT, PAYE and National Insurance payments in response to the coronavirus outbreak, warning that thousands of jobs could be lost otherwise. Make UK said that while loan guarantees and other measures could help in the medium term, they could take some time to be useful for firms who are already facing a cash squeeze. Factories across the country have closed, including car plants such as Nissan\u2019s Sunderland factory and Peugeot\u2019s Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, said: There are alarm bells going off right across the manufacturing sector with the prospect of substantial lay-offs looming. Order books are collapsing and this is creating immediate cashflow issues for companies which need addressing within days not weeks. The measures already announced by the chancellor are welcome but, events are so fast moving that we need to go further. As such, we need urgent measures which will have an immediate impact on the ability of companies to stay afloat during this crisis and retain their staff. Market turmoil has boosted trading in recent weeks, which is ultimately good news for some investment banks like Credit Suisse, writes the Guardian\u2019s banking correspondent, Kalyeena Makortoff. In an unscheduled market update on Thursday, the Swiss lender said higher trading volumes were boosting its private banking revenues, helping offset a drop in its capital markets division. (Capital markets bankers help companies issue new shares to raise cash - but the current market sell-off has forced firms to look elsewhere for new funds) Credit Suisse said it was also in a strong position due to its lower exposure to the oil and gas sector as well as leveraged debt, referring to loans offered to firms which are highly indebted or have poor credit history. The bank said: This has substantially increased our resilience and preparedness for the impact of the spread of COVID-19 and the consequent market and economic volatility. However, Credit Suisse warned that it was difficult to know how the pandemic would impact its results going forward: We continue to monitor our credit exposures prudently in light of these conditions. However, we are very satisfied with how the teams have so far navigated the increased volatility, including in areas such as share-backed lending. Germany\u2019s Dax is now in the red as well as the FTSE 100. It appears that the rush provided by the European Central Bank may be fading. However, a decline of 0.8% on the Dax today still represents stability compared to the moves of recent weeks. The question is whether investors hold their nerve, considering the eye-watering recession forecasts for every major economy. Central banks are queuing up to stimulate their economies. Here\u2019s the latest from Reuters on Taiwan: Taiwan\u2019s central bank cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years on Thursday to a new low and reduced its growth forecast for the export-oriented economy amid growing fears that the coronavirus could trigger a global recession. The central bank lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 1.125%, it said in a statement after a policy meeting. Here\u2019s more on the deal between the government and energy suppliers, from the Guardian\u2019s energy correspondent, Jillian Ambrose. The government has agreed new emergency measures with energy suppliers to help households which are in financial distress or unable to leave home to top-up pre-pay energy meters. The government has ordered energy companies to offer struggling customers help meeting their energy bills by reducing or pausing bills, and offering debt repayments plans. Suppliers must also completely suspend disconnections for the 4m homes which use pre-pay meters. Instead, suppliers may add credit to the meter remotely or send hard-hit households pre-loaded top-up cards so that energy supply is not interrupted. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said those most in need \u201ccan rest assured that a secure supply of energy will continue to flow into their homes during this difficult time\u201d. An interesting story from the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin. There have been widespread anecdotal reports of the internet struggling under the weight of people working from home, and now the EU has confirmed it. The European Union\u2019s industry chief has called on Netflix and other streaming services to take action to reduce congestion on the internet, amid surging demand as millions of people confined to their homes go online. Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for industry, told Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings that he and other operators should take responsibility for preventing internet congestion by switching to standard definition rather than high definition. In a statement Breton said: Streaming platforms, telecom operators and users, we all have a joint responsibility to take steps to ensure the smooth functioning of the internet during the battle against the virus propagation. The commission would also like internet users to reduce their data consumption, by using Wi-FI or choosing lower resolution for content. The coronavirus has led to a spike in internet usage, as parents working at home make video conference calls, while children log on for online lessons or digital games.

Despite Next and British Gas owner Centrica (up 12% after the government agreed a deal to secure households\u2019 energy supplies) the FTSE 100 has now actually slipped to a loss of 0.9%. Some of the momentum on European exchanges has been lost as well. The Dax in Germany is up by only 0.5% according to our latest data, although the main European benchmarks outside of London are still green for today. Next, the clothing and homewear retailer, is the top riser on the FTSE 100 after it put out a fairly confident statement this morning. Shares are up by 14%. Chief executive Simon Wolfson, said retailers are \u201cfacing a crisis that is unprecedented in living memory, but we believe that our balance sheet and margins mean that we can weather the storm\u201d. The company has carried out a stress test showing that it could \u201ccomfortably sustain the loss of more than \u00a31bn (25%) of annual full price sales, without exceeding our current bond and bank facilities\u201d. This includes the chancellor\u2019s business rates holiday, but doesn\u2019t take into account the possibility of further government support. Lord Wolfson, who is a Conservative peer, said: When the pandemic first appeared in China, we assumed that the threat was to our supply chain. It is now very clear that the risk to demand is by far the greatest challenge we face and we need to prepare for a significant downturn in sales for the duration of the pandemic. Total sales for the year ending in January 2020 rose by 3.5% on last year. Group profit before tax was up 0.8%, at \u00a3728.5m, even beating its previous guidance because of a stronger-than-expected Janaury. Discount retailer B&amp;M has revealed some of the items that are flying off its shelves, as the retail sector adjusts to much of the country working from home. Increased sales of hand-washing products are perhaps understandable, but a sevenfold increase in Pot Noodle sales is somewhat alarming, notes Guardian retail reporter Sarah Butler. Influential ratings agency Moody\u2019s has published a verdict on the UK government and Bank of England coronavirus measures. They said the moves support the banking sector and offset some of the risks to the UK\u2019s debt rating. However, there is of course large uncertainty around the judgements - and the agency also quibbled with the idea of a large expansion in government debt potentially being problematic (at least from the point of view of their investor clients). Sarah Carlson, the lead sovereign analyst for the UK at Moody\u2019s, said: While businesses small and large will welcome short-term relief from cash-flow constraints, the extent to which the new initiatives will mitigate the damage to the economy and the resulting cost to the banking system remains unknown because the magnitude and duration of the coronavirus-induced disruption itself is highly uncertain. While their scale underlines the gravity of the situation, any measures that help to reduce the damage caused by the economic downturn will help limit a decline in banks\u2019 asset quality, and therefore support their creditworthiness. If this effort was successful in reducing the deterioration in banks\u2019 asset quality, this would have mixed credit implications for the sovereign. It would clearly entail some fiscal cost, but it would also reduce any increase in the sovereign\u2019s susceptibility to banking sector risk. The opinions of the agency (and rivals such as Fitch and S&amp;P Ratings) are important because a change in bond ratings for a company or government can determine whether pension funds are allowed to own the debt - although their reputation was severely hit during the last crisis. German business morale has slumped to its lowest since 2009, during the financial crisis, in a clear sign that recession appears inevitable. The Ifo institute said preliminary results from its March survey showed its business climate index slumped to 87.7 from 96.0 in February, Reuters reported. The index is usually closely watched as a leading indicator of economic growth,but given the extraordinary measures taken to stop travel across Europe, perhaps its main use is to put the disruption into historical context. Ifo president Clemens Fuest said: This is the biggest drop since 1991 and the lowest value since August 2009. Germany is falling into recession. Let\u2019s see some reaction to the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus measures - which came late in the evening, no doubt after frantic discussions in its Frankfurt headquarters. \u201cWe went to bed early last evening, which appears to have been a mistake,\u201d said Claus Vistesen, chief Eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He calculates that the ECB will buy just over \u20ac115B per month in the next nine months, \u201ca significant lift\u201d. The original programme (a hangover from the last eurozone crisis) was \u20ac20bn per month; \u20ac120bn in new purchases were added last week until the end of 2020. Now we get another \u20ac750bn, taking the monthly pace to \u20ac116B. We have been very critical of the ECB in the past few weeks, primarily because we consider the message that monetary policy is close to its limits, with the inference that fiscal policy has to step in, as a very dangerous signal to send to markets, especially in this environment. We are happy to eat our words today, at least based on the scope and size of this package, and, just as importantly, the manner in which it is communicated to markets. The ECB has it\u2019s mojo back, and that\u2019s a good thing! The comparisons have flowed with Mario Draghi\u2019s 2012 speech, in which he promised to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the eurozone. Lagarde\u2019s new version (announced via Twitter rather than a speech in London) is that there are \u201cno limits\u201d. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, an investment bank, said: We don\u2019t know whether someone from the EuroTower made a phone call to Mario Draghi but the beating around the bush should be over, at least for now. In the short run, financial markets and the economy will still depend on how the pandemic and with it the preventive government measures to tackle it evolve. This will be the main determinant for the depth of the recession. The fact that the Eurozone has finally come to terms with the magnitude of the crisis should cushion the downswing and is an important prerequisite for a swift rebound. As so often in the past, it took the Eurozone (and this time around also the ECB) a while to react. The policy reactions did not come with one big coordinated swoop, but the package of government stimulus, liquidity and guarantees combined with Lagarde\u2019s \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 as it stands right now is strong. David Zahn, head of European fixed income at investor Franklin Templeton, said: This also demonstrates that the ECB will continue to unveil measures to combat the dislocations in the market resulting from the Pandemic. The increased quantitative easing program combined with the measures the ECB announced at last week\u2019s should be very supportive for the Euro-zone. We expect policy to remain extremely accommodative and the ECB to support markets as we have fiscal loosening of European Countries, which has been one of Lagarde\u2019s key demands. Direct Line, the UK\u2019s biggest car insurer, has dropped plans for a \u00a3150m share buyback as it looks to conserve cash during the coronavirus crisis. The company, which also owns the Churchill and Green Flag brands, has previously said that it expects to be able to cope with coronavirus-related claims. Advice to Britons to self-isolate and practice social distancing could reduce the number of car accidents. Travel claims related to the virus climbed to \u00a35m on 15 March, up from around \u00a31m on 3 March, it said on Thursday. *This post has been corrected. A previous version incorrectly said Direct Line\u2019s buyback was \u00a3250m. Apologies for the error. Here\u2019s what \u20ac750bn in stimulus (or more than \u20ac1tn if you count previously announced measures) gets you: a concerted rise in European equities. France and Italy are leading the way. The airline industry is under extraordinary pressure worldwide. Qantas and Lufthansa today announced more pain. Australia\u2019s flag-carrier, Qantas, will stand down the majority of its 30,000 employees until at least the end of May 2020. Periods of unpaid leave are inevitable, it said. Senior group management executives and the airline\u2019s board will take no salary or bonuses this year. Germany\u2019s Lufthansa said that the magnitude of the expected decline in its earnings is currently not predictable because of the crisis. The company delayed the publication of its financial results for 2019. Carsten Spohr, chairman of the executive board of Lufthansa, said: The longer this crisis lasts, the more likely it is that the future of aviation cannot be guaranteed without state aid. *This post has been corrected. A previous version said that 30,000 Qantas employees will go on leave. The correct number was 20,000. The gains on the FTSE 100 have accelerated: the blue-chip index has now gained 0.8%. It is volatile though. However, the mid-cap FTSE 250 has moved by 1.2% in the other direction. In Italy the FTSE MIB has regained 3%. Italy has been the worst affected country in Europe during the outbreak. France\u2019s Cac 40 is up by 2.2%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has gained 1.2%. London-based fashion group Burberry has warned that the coronavirus outbreak could reduce sales by between 70% and 80%. Burberry said on Thursday it expected sales at comparable retail stores in the final weeks of its financial year to 28 March to be down between 70% and 80%, and as a result it expected overall fourth quarter sales to be 30% lower. However, the fashion house said that it had \u00a3600m of cash on hand plus \u00a3300m in credit it could draw down. It is also cutting costs to stave off any further problems it said. Its statement said: We are implementing mitigating actions to contain costs and protect our financial position, including renegotiating rents, restricting travel and reducing discretionary spending. Saying that European stock markets have stabilised somewhat does not mean that the turmoil is over, however. There is little sign of a let-up on currency markets this morning. The pound has lost 1% against the US dollar so far today, with a global scramble by companies to free up cash dollars underway. Its lowest point was $1.1471. Below $1.1459 and it will be the lowest since 1985 - a mark set only yesterday before a slight rebound. Here\u2019s a chart to show just how extraordinary it is: sterling against the US dollar since the 1980s. (The data are patchier at the start.) In London the FTSE 100 has gained 0.2% in early trading. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index is flat. The Dax in Germany gained 0.8% and France\u2019s Cac 40 gained 0.5%. Across Europe the Stoxx 600 index was down by 0.6% in early exchanges. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of economics, business and markets in the UK, the eurozone and worldwide. The European Central Bank has become the latest to unleash a massive wave of quantitative easing in a bid to sustain the eurozone economy \u2013 which like everywhere is under huge pressure from lockdowns trying to control the coronavirus pandemic. The initial reaction of shock and awe to the announcement made late last night dissipated quickly, but European and UK stock market futures ahead of morning trading appear to show that markets could stabilise after a period of turmoil. There are \u201cno limits\u201d, ECB president Christine Lagarde said on Twitter last night. The so-called Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) will continue until the end of the year at least, and will be expanded to commercial paper, a debt instrument, from large companies outside the financial sector. It will also loosen rules on another programme designed to help companies get money, the additional credit claims programme. The statement from the ECB\u2019s governing council is, in central bank terms, extraordinary. It makes it clear that \u201cself-imposed limits\u201d could be abandoned \u2013 suggesting that this wave of quantitative easing could get bigger: The Governing Council will do everything necessary within its mandate. The Governing Council is fully prepared to increase the size of its asset purchase programmes and adjust their composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed. It will explore all options and all contingencies to support the economy through this shock. To the extent that some self-imposed limits might hamper action that the ECB is required to take in order to fulfil its mandate, the Governing Council will consider revising them to the extent necessary to make its action proportionate to the risks that we face. The ECB will not tolerate any risks to the smooth transmission of its monetary policy in all jurisdictions of the euro area. Stock market indices struggled in the wake of the announcement, suggesting there is scepticism from investors as to whether it will be enough to counteract the economic effects of the outbreak. But in the context of previous moves of more than 5% either way the volatility was relatively muted. In China the CSI 300 index, which tracks large stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen, fell by 1.3%. The Shanghai Stock Exchange composite index lost 0.98%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong lost 1.5%. On the other hand, Japan\u2019s broad-based Topix index gained 1%, but the blue-chip Nikkei 225 lost 1%. The ASX 200 in Australia lost 3.4% - despite its central bank counterpart, the Reserve Bank of Australia - also cutting interest rates this morning in a bid to sustain the economy.
