But they may well feel they deserved more than that \u2013 they were excellent for the most part, everyone knowing their jobs to the letter, and it took until around the 70th minute for Barca to start cutting them open. Then Suarez scored \u2013 replays show it might actually have glanced in off the hand of a ducking Pique \u2013 and it was always going to be hard after that. Pacheco could have got a firmer hand on Messi\u2019s free-kick, I\u2019d say, but this will go down as another one the world\u2019s best player has pulled out of the fire. It was a fairly quiet debut for Coutinho, by the way, but nobody will mind just now. What on earth can stop Barcelona from romping to the title? Thanks a lot for your company \u2013 see you again soon! Barca go 11 points clear ... just! 90+2 min: Alcacer plays in Messi, who feints, shimmies, jinks and seems to have done the hard work ... but then jabs at a relieved Pacheco. 90+1 min: It was actually Sobrino who had that penalty claim. We have three added minutes. 89 min: In a change I *have* noticed, Demirovic is on for Duarte. 87 min: Alaves now up the press and get a long throw in, hurled by Wakaso into the box. Munir, whose arrival on the pitch I missed and who is actually on loan from Barca, swings a boot at it and claims a handball as the ball strikes Umtiti, whose hands are down by his side. I\u2019m not sure he had a case, it hit his wrist but the arm wasn\u2019t raised or extended. 86 min: Poor, poor Alaves though. They have been superb. Are you surprised? I\u2019m not surprised. That is picturebook brilliance by Messi, who steps up and plants the ball up, over, down and into the roof of the net. Pacheco gets a finger to it and, as it\u2019s not right in the corner, may have expected to do better. But it\u2019s all about Messi, yet again. 83 min: Here we go, though \u2013 Barca have a free-kick, a yard outside the box, in prime Messi territory. It came from a really shocking slide on Alcacer by Wakaso, who must have nine lives tonight. I can\u2019t believe he is still on the pitch. 82 min: Iniesta, who has come to life, tries to tickle one through to Suarez but there\u2019s just too much on it. Pacheco is alert yet again. 81 min: Alaves\u2019s left-back, Duarte, is a player I know little about but has greatly impressed me today. Scouting report for you there. 78 min: Suarez glances a Messi ball well wide. It\u2019s attack vs defence now, more than at any other time. Alaves don\u2019t look especially panicked, to be fair to them, and I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s a given that they\u2019ll buckle and lose. 76 min: Suarez is in again, a loose defensive header sending him haring into the right side of the box. Alcacer is waiting for a tap-in but Suarez fancies a second goal and gets it wrong, blasting over. 74 min: Now we\u2019ll see what Alaves are made of. Messi drills a wide free kick into Pacheco\u2019s midriff but you suspect there\u2019ll be more coming his way. Yes, they\u2019d ramped it up in the last few minutes and you could sense something might happen. Iniesta, hitherto so quiet, weaves his way down the left flank and gets to the line, chipping over a delectable cross that Suarez, meeting it beyond the far post, volleys across Pacheco. A sliding defender can\u2019t stop it going in, and the unbeaten record may well remain intact! 71 min: Close again for Barca, as Paulinho is found right in front of goal by an improvised Pique flick. Pacheco makes a marvellous double save, blocking the first effort and then knowing little about the second, before the ball is headed away close to the line. Now Alaves may be tiring. 68 min: Alaves have started to threaten on the counter again but the risk is that they\u2019ll now be picked apart ... and as I write they are, Messi releasing Suarez with a sensational ball through Duarte\u2019s legs. It\u2019s Barca\u2019s best chance of the game but Pacheco stands up superbly, saving with his right ankle, and the ball deflects away! 67 min: \u201cThe idea of Barcelona struggling due to some key players not playing loses street cred as soon as you see Messi, Suarez and Coutinho in their attacking line up,\u201d writes John Ryan. \u201cLooks like Alaves just want it more, maybe Barcelona are thinking this is one of the five games or so they can give up before Real Madrid come anywhere close to catching them ...\u201d 66 min: Coutinho\u2019s race is run \u2013 he\u2019s not got into the second half, certainly. Alcacer comes on to try and salvage this for Barca. 64 min: Alaves defender Laguardia, showing he is so much more than New York\u2019s third-biggest airport, snuffs out a Rakitic burst. Barca are yet to really create anything in this half and the shock really could be on. A daisycutter from Paulinho straight through to Pacheco only heightens that impression. 63 min: The first Alaves change sees former Leeds loanee Alfonso Pedraza replace Perez. 62 min: It could \u2013 should? \u2013 be two! Guidetti plays Perez in with a stunning reverse pass but he delays too long and two defenders get back to deny him a clear sight of goal! He does slip the ball left to an open Duarte though, whose thunderous strike deflects wide. The corner comes to nought. 59 min: Alba finds space and that\u2019s because, when Barca break down the middle, Alaves have seven players *astonishingly* narrow, all compacted into a few square yards, to avoid being prised open. It works because the resulting cross towards Messi is squeezed back to Pacheco. 57 min: Now Roberto gets space to whip a cross in behind, but nobody is attacking it and it\u2019s down the throat of Pacheco anyway. 55 min: They do win a corner after Messi and Roberto attempt to combine, but it\u2019s punched away by the impressive Pacheco. 54 min: It\u2019s hardly been the thundering start to the second half Barca wanted; the commentary team seem to have seen an improvement that I, so far, haven\u2019t. They\u2019ve always got a moment of magic in them though. 53 min: Sure enough, Valverde changes his full-backs. Alba and Roberto on, Digne and Semedo off. That\u2019s an upgrade. 52 min: Something Alaves have done very well so far is snuff out Iniesta. He and Digne aren\u2019t on the same wavelength and I think Jordi Alba may come on soon. 50 min: \u201cAlaves are good, but they\u2019re no Dundee United. Played Barca four times in competitive matches, beat them four times. I need to remind myself of this constantly, given the mess we\u2019re in now. Drink helps too,\u201d mourns Simon McMahon. Reminds me of an Aberdeen fan I met a few years ago in Bata, Equatorial Guinea, who owned a bar there that doubled as a shrine to his club\u2019s 1983 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final win over Real Madrid. 48 min: Coutinho looks to play a return pass over for Suarez but the execution can\u2019t match the idea and it runs out behind the goal. 47 min: The ball has been worked around the Alaves half in these early stages. No way through yet ... Alaves can\u2019t ... can they? Would there be a chink of light for the chasing pack if Barca lost this? No, probably not \u2013 that\u2019s the truth of it. Second-placed Atletico would still be eight points behind. But Alaves, the last team to beat Barca at home in the league, will still be cheered on by the rest of the top clubs \u2013 particularly another one in Madrid \u2013 over the second half. It starts shortly .... Coutinho watch: inventive, bright and looking to make things happen, with some good signs of understanding already. One chance, deflected wide. Not a bad start but he\u2019ll want to be more involved at the sharp end. No complaints there, surely, for Barca \u2013 who got closer but still saw little come off. Alaves, who had already posed a threat before Guidetti\u2019s potent double-hit, have been disciplined and bright. You still sense it\u2019s a long second half ahead for the underdogs, though ... Barca get a last-ditch corner but Alaves survive and they do go in ahead, courtesy of that odd Guidetti finish. They deserve it despite seeing only 26% of the ball! How about this! 45 min: Alaves are a minute or so from going in at half-time ahead ... and it would be convenient, as Barca are finally posing some clear and concerted threat. 43 min: Wakaso, who has been booked already, is very lucky not to be booked again for a bad foul on Coutinho, who limps away. He is surely on the edge now. Messi has a free-kick 30 yards out ... and it\u2019s a beautiful effort, kept out only by a combination of Pacheco and the near post! 41 min: Then Suarez finds Messi with a cute ball over the top ... but the genius\u2019s touch lets him down and the chance goes! 40 min: Gomez finds Sobrino in space down the left with a superb ball but, with Guidetti awaiting the cross, his delivery hits the first defender. Alaves, for the first time really, then have a little spell of possession. 37 min: Barcelona now have virtually 100% of the ball but Alaves aren\u2019t letting them do that much with it. And they\u2019ve shown how effective they can be at the other end ... 35 min: Messi goes for goal with an angled free-kick on the right, batted over by Pacheco with little ceremony. The corner glances off Rakitic and flies wide. 34 min: That Guidetti finish, by the way, was most definitely a deflection off his own standing leg. Meanwhile Barca\u2019s corner is dealt with. 32 min: Coutinho comes close! That\u2019s the closest they have come. Rakitic\u2019s cross is desperately cleared and it falls to Coutinho, in a great position, 18 yards out. He wraps his foot around the ball but it deflects just wide off Duarte, who is going to need some treatment. 31 min: Sobrino, who is having a fine game, starts running on halfway and keeps on going towards the box. He has Umtiti jockeying him and eventually runs out of steam, shooting harmlessly towards Ter Stegen, but it was bright work again. 30 min: The goal, and the chance for Gomez before it, could have been prevented by a modicum of defensive diligence. Barca had so many men forward both times \u2013 did they not expect any threat at all from the visitors? Iniesta curls over as Ernesto Valverde\u2019s side seek some punch of their own. 28 min: There is a long, long way to go but Barcelona look shaken and have really produced little of note yet. Could this be the day their unbeaten record goes, against all odds? 26 min: It\u2019s nearly two \u2013 what a save from Ter Stegen! An Alaves throw on the right is flicked on and met at the near post by Sobrino only for the \u2018keeper to arch his back and superbly claw the hooked effort away, one-handed, from his far corner. Duarte is then booked for a hack on Messi. 25 min: That was Guidetti\u2019s first league goal since last May. Alaves have been brilliant on the counter here! Barca are floundering. My goodness! They cannot say they weren\u2019t warned! Barca lose the ball on the edge of the Alaves box and the ball is instantly worked through to Guidetti, who has a whole half to run into. He has a long time to think about what\u2019s next and just about keeps his cool, putting a curious finish \u2013 I think he slipped and possibly even hit it against his other foot! \u2013 inside the near post. Well! 22 min: Suarez forces a save from Pacheco there though, glancing a Messi free-kick towards goal but seeing the \u2018keeper save sharply to his left. Then Wakaso is booked for a late tackle on Rakitic. 20 min: Alaves are certainly no great shakes in possession but for my money they have started well and with a good shape. Barca have seen lots of the ball but are yet to create a good chance, and are a touch lucky not to be behind. 18 min: Actually, Gomez was a bit tentative with that chance, having seen it again. The ball from Perez was OK, but Gomez didn\u2019t really attack it and let it run across him, allowing Ter Stegen to save his right-footed nudge. 16 min: ... Alaves create a great chance! From the Barca set piece they purr up the pitch and Gomez is completely clear if they can get it to him. The ball is *just* that little bit to his left, allowing Ter Stegen time to come out and spread himself, blocking sharply. The visitors could so easily have been ahead there! 15 min: Guidetti rises to win a header at the far post but everyone else is ahead of the ball. Barca click into gear and Messi moves them slickly upfield, a Suarez cross eventually being turned behind his own goal by a defender. The corner is cleared and then ... 13 min: Coutinho, full of ideas on the right, slips in Semedo with a delightful ball but his cutback is intercepted. 12 min: A lengthy Barca passing move is curtailed, deep in his own half, by that man Sobrino. Alaves then show some intent on the counter, getting several men forward, but Gomez wastes the position with an outside-of-the-ball cross straight at Ter Stegen. 10 min: Sobrino tries to do something down the left, but soon has three Barca players around him and is left to claim a non-existent foul from Paulinho. At the other end Coutinho tries to find his old Liverpool buddy Suarez, who has moved just offside. 9 min: I should mention that Alaves\u2019s manager is the former Barca legend Abelardo Fernandez, whose appointment in December has brought significantly improved form. He\u2019ll know how to handle this one. 7 min: Semedo tries to play in Coutinho, quiet early on, but the ball is just behind him. Barca keep the ball and work it left to Digne, who flashes an angled effort not far wide. 5 min: A Suarez ball beyond Messi at the far post is Barca\u2019s main activity so far. Alaves have started as if willing to make it tough; I guess there\u2019s the carrot of terminating this monumental unbeaten run of the hosts\u2019, but we\u2019ll see what happens if they go a goal down. 4 min: Sobrino, of course, makes an all Man City old-boy attacking partnership for Alaves, although he never actually played for City and I\u2019m not sure he spent much time in Manchester at all. 2 min: Ter Stegen almost gets into some early pressure when letting a backpass run across him, with Sobrino lurking, but manages to clear. Alaves are pressing well early on. They wear white shirts with Peru-style red flashes. Luis Suarez is receiving, from Eric Abidal, a trophy for La Liga\u2019s best player of December. He\u2019s on hot goalscoring form with 12 in his last nine! They\u2019re lining up in the tunnel at the Nou Camp. Barca have won their last six in the league ... surely they\u2019ll make it seven? Out they come ... Who\u2019s that \u201cGuidetti\u201d I see on the Alaves teamsheet, I hear you ask. It\u2019s John Guidetti, silly \u2013 former Man City wunderkind, freshly on loan from Celta Vigo. He is still only 25; it could still happen for him! Alaves did beat Sevilla at home a fortnight ago, so they\u2019re no mugs, and to be fair their plight wouldn\u2019t look anything like as severe had they not started the season so awfully \u2013 losing their first six. Since then they have won six, lost seven in the league, and that\u2019s hardly bad. They are, though, La Liga\u2019s joint-second-lowest goalscorers with 16 so don\u2019t expect anything too buccaneering tonight. Want to know what else has happened in La Liga \u2013 and across Europe \u2013 this weekend? Check out our roundup: Big expectations! Oh, Getafe have equalised in the 93rd minute there! Any chance of similar drama in ... oooh ... 26 minutes\u2019 time? On my television currently it is Sevilla 1-0 Getafe. It would be a useful win for the former\u2019s Champions League prospects. Coutinho, of course, came on as a substitute during the cup win over Espanyol. I didn\u2019t really see how he got on, can anyone enlighten me? And do we think he\u2019s the best fit for this Barcelona team? He\u2019s a lovely player ... but ... but ... I\u2019m going to say it ... I think Christian Eriksen is better. Barcelona: Ter Stegen; Semedo, Piqu\u00e9, Umtiti, Digne; Rakitic, Iniesta, Paulinho, Coutinho; Su\u00e1rez, Messi. Subs: Cillessen, Sergio, Alcacer, Alba, Roberto, Vidal, Mina. Alaves: Pacheco, Alexis, Laguardia, Marip\u00e1n, Duarte, Ibai G\u00f3mez, Medr\u00e1n, Wakaso, H. P\u00e9rez, Guidetti, Rub\u00e9n Sobrino. Subs: Sivera, Martin, Vigaray, Pedraza, Munir, Di\u00e9guez y Demirovic. On paper this fixture \u2013 first against 17th \u2013 is both a formality and not *especially* enticing. But there\u2019s a big \u201cbut\u201d! As you\u2019ll see shortly when I provide the teamsheet, this is Philippe Coutinho\u2019s first start for Barcelona. And he starts alongside Messi, Suarez and Iniesta. Surely this will be fun, games and much more besides? What hope, then, for poor Alaves? They were beaten 2-0 at home earlier this season by a Messi pair and, last February, were demolished 6-0 on their own turf. Barca then went on to beat them 3-1 in the Copa del Rey final. Well ... there is a glimmer of light if you search for it. In September 2016, under Dead Man Walking Mauricio Pellegrini, they had the sheer cheek to steal a 2-1 win at the Nou Camp \u2013 so why not do it again? Perhaps because Barca are running away with the division this season and unlikely to be caught cold, while Alaves \u2013 ninth last time around \u2013 are simply not as good this time. It should be a comfortable enough home win, then, but we\u2019ve seen enough to be surprised before. Send in your thoughts, and away we go ... Nick is on his way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
