Fox News asked Trump if he thought climate change had contributed to California\u2019s wildfires. Trump said: \u201cMaybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management.\u201d In an interview scheduled to air on Sunday, Trump added: \u201cYou need management,\u201d and then said: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that in a negative way, a positive I\u2019m just saying the facts.\u201d It echoes Trump\u2019s tweet a week ago, in which he threatened to withhold federal payments to California and claimed its forest management is \u201cso poor\u201d. Trump is scheduled to visit the devastated northern California town of Paradise on Saturday. At least 63 people died there in the country\u2019s deadliest wildfire in a century, and more than 600 people are missing or unaccounted for. Trump had previously said via Twitter that there was \u201cno reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d Firefighters in northern California had mixed thoughts on Trump\u2019s comments but say their main focus is fighting the blaze. As firefighters returned to a command center in the northern California city of Chico on Friday after 24-hour shifts, some learned for the first time that Trump was scheduled to visit on Saturday. The firefighter Joshua Watson said he viewed the upcoming visit as a sign of support for firefighters, \u201cno matter what you think about him\u201d. Gary Jacobs, a firefighter sent from San Mateo county, said everybody had their own opinions and he stayed out of politics. Michael Baldwin, a Cal Fire captain from Mendocino county, said Trump\u2018s comments that blamed poor forest management for the blaze were \u201cill-informed\u201d and came at the wrong time. Republican politicians have regularly complained that environmental regulations hamper proper management of forests, allowing flammable vegetation to build up and act as fuel for fires. Several ecologists, however, have pointed out that \u201cmanagement\u201d is typically code for logging by industry, whereby large stands of trees that would typically survive a wildfire are removed, leaving behind debris that is often more effective at spreading flames. Logging, therefore, can make forest fires worse. Fire is a natural part of the ecology of California, helping forests clear underbrush, regenerate and spread seeds for the next generation of trees. Human factors have changed the equation, however \u2013 California\u2019s population is nearing 40 million, adding a more than 300,000 people a year since 2010, with many moving into and developing scenic forest areas that often burn. Experts have said this has increased the risk of deadly encounters with fire. Trump has also been criticized for overlooking the fact that 60% of the state\u2019s forests are under federal management. The Camp fire started on or near federal land before moving on to private property. Brian K Rice, president of California Professional Firefighters, has said: \u201cThe president\u2019s message attacking California and threatening to withhold aid to the victims of the cataclysmic fires is ill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning to those who are suffering as well as the men and women on the frontlines.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
