Guardian Australia revealed last week that Taylor met with Frydenberg\u2019s office and department officials to discuss the federal government\u2019s designation of critically endangered grasslands. The meetings occurred at the same time that New South Wales and federal investigations were underway into the poisoning of 30 hectares that contained the grasses on a property in the state\u2019s Monaro region owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. One of the directors of that company is Richard Taylor, the minister\u2019s brother, and the minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. After lobbying by Taylor, Frydenberg\u2019s office canvassed whether protections for the grasslands \u2013 known as the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands \u2013 could be watered down and if it could be kept secret. Taylor has said the briefing he received from the department was unrelated to the investigation. Emails obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information showed Frydenberg\u2019s office specifically requested the department\u2019s assistant secretary of compliance, Monica Collins, attend. The office of compliance investigates potential breaches of national environment laws and the department said last week Collins did not go to the meeting on 20 March 2017. But the department has now confirmed another compliance officer attended in her place. Labor and the Greens say it raises fresh questions about why the meeting was sought by Frydenberg\u2019s office, on Taylor\u2019s behalf, while Frydenberg was the environment minister and Taylor was the minister for cities. In response to questions, Taylor said: \u201cI made no requests as to who participated in this briefing. \u201cAs the department has already confirmed, the briefing did not include discussion of compliance action.\u201d The environment and energy department confirmed the compliance officer was present, along with Geoff Richardson, the assistant secretary of the department\u2019s protected species and communities branch, as well as a member of Richardson\u2019s staff. A spokesperson said the investigator attended the meeting \u201cas an observer\u201d. \u201cThe purpose of the meeting was to outline the technical aspects of the grasslands listing, which had been raised as the No 1 issue of concern to farmers in the Monaro region,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cDepartment officials were aware of the compliance matter and did not discuss the matter with Minister Taylor.\u201d But Labor\u2019s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said there was a growing list of questions for both ministers. \u201cThe long list of unanswered questions for the treasurer and minister Taylor about this rapidly escalating ministerial ethics scandal is growing,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWho knew what and when? The government needs to come clean with the Australian people about this outrageous and deeply troubling set of allegations, which is eating away at public trust in the government.\u201d The Greens\u2019 deputy leader, Larissa Waters, said the party would demand an explanation when parliament resumes next week. \u201cA federal anti-corruption body is long overdue and the Greens will push to ensure such a body has broad powers to investigate scandals like this one,\u201d Waters said. The grasslands have been protected under Australia\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act since 2000. Their status was upgraded from endangered to critically endangered by the former environment minister Greg Hunt in 2016. Taylor, who has repeatedly denied making any representations regarding the compliance action, said he was briefed in his capacity as the member for Hume \u201cgiven the significant impact of these changes on farmers in my electorate\u201d. The critically endangered grasslands are mainly found on the Monaro plains, which are not in Hume. However, some communities of the grassland are found in Taylor\u2019s electorate. Guardian Australia did not receive responses to a list of questions put to Frydenberg. His office referred back to the treasurer\u2019s statements from last week: \u201cThe listing of natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands was revised up from endangered to critically endangered on 6 April 2016,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cIn early 2017, the member for Hume subsequently sought a meeting to understand the impact on his constituents of the revised listing. Following the briefing and since, no changes to the listing have been made.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
