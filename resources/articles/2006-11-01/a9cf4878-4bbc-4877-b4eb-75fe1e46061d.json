Closing date for entries is midnight 22 November 2006. 2. There is one prize in total, courtesy of Kuoni Sport Abroad. The prize is for two adults sharing one room and must be taken on the specified date: departing from Heathrow on 21 December and arriving back on 1 January 2007 (although you can extend the trip at your own cost). Please do not enter if you cannot travel on that date, as the prize is non-transferable and there is no cash, or holiday alternative. The prize includes return economy class flights to Melbourne, eight nights accommodation at the Hilton Melbourne on a room only basis, tickets for the five days of the Test match, Christmas lunch at the gound and an Australian visa (for UK Passport holders only). The winner will be responsible for all other costs associated with the trip, and for ensuring they have a valid passport and visa for travel to Australia. 3. The prize does not include travel insurance (which you must take out), any meals (apart from Christmas lunch at the MCG) or any drinks, all of which you must pay for. No spending money is included. 4. The promotion is open to residents of the U.K. and ROI aged 18 and over. 5. The promotion is not open to employees of Guardian Newspapers Limited, Kuoni, their agencies or anyone else connected with the creation or administration of the promotion. 6. Only one entry is allowed per person. 7. No responsibility is taken for entries lost, delayed, misdirected or incomplete due to server functions, virus, bugs or any other causes outside GNL's control. Proof of entry is not proof of receipt. 8. The prize is non-exchangeable, non-transferable, and is not redeemable for cash or other prizes. GNL retains the right to substitute the prize with another prize of similar value in the event the original prize offered is not available due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control. 9. The winner will be notified by phone within one day of the closing date. The winner is required to accept the prize within 48 hours of notification. In the event of non-acceptance, GNL will re-draw and select a new winner (the same acceptance period will apply for the new winner). 10. No purchase necessary. 11. Winners names will be published in The Observer and on its website. 12. GNL cannot accept any responsibility for any damage, loss, injury or disappointment suffered by any entrant as a result of entering the promotion or accepting the prize or any injury or damage to the entrant's or any other person's computer or mobile telephone relating to or resulting from participation in or downloading any materials in connection with the promotion.

All entry instructions and any other specific details relating to the competition or the prizes form part of these Terms. If GNL becomes aware of any fraud, deceit or similar action during or in relation to the competition which relates in any way to a claim, then that claim will not be met unless it is proven to the satisfaction of GNL, that you had no actual or imputed knowledge of the such fraud or deceit or similar action. For the avoidance of doubt (and without limitation), if you provide an incorrect name, age, address or other incorrect information in relation to the entry, then GNL reserves the absolute right to treat that entry as invalid (whether or not such information comes to light before or after you have made the claim). If the fraud, deceit or other action is only discovered after the prize has been released, you undertake to return the same (or provide compensation) to GNL forthwith upon discovery by GNL. 16.
