It did not specify what that support was, but the clear implication was that he was somehow covering up or excusing Brady\u2019s actions. This is a travesty of Longford\u2019s role, which was to undertake a 14-year struggle to have Brady transferred from the general prison to Ashworth special hospital, a secure mental institution suitable for dealing with the challenges Brady posed. That struggle was successful in 1985. It was the Home Office\u2019s failure to listen to Longford sooner that led to the abuse your report refers to. Longford records that Brady, soon after arriving at Ashworth, \u201cnot only cut off communication [with me] but, according to one newspaper, referred to me as a \u2018Home Office lackey\u2019\u201d. I believe you should set the record straight on this matter.
