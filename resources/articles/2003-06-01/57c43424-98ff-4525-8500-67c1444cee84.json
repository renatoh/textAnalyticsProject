The Only person left outside was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four. In Privet Drive this sort of thing just wasn't on. Teenage boys lying around in flowerbeds isn't the sort of thing the residents of Privet Drive paid their taxes for. But nobody complained because nobody had noticed. No one remarked on the boy's happy look, his round national health glasses, or even the rather strange scar on his forehead. Harry Potter was enjoying his first bit of peace and quiet for seventeen days, which just happened to be the same number of days since he'd returned from Hogwarts, the school for wizards that he attended. Beneath his cloak of invisibility, which had belonged to his father, he concluded it had saved him from ghouls and demons in the past but best of all it had also saved him from the Dursleys. Especially today; his cousin Dudley's birthday. For a quiet life Harry had made it a rule to try to keep out of everyone's way on Dudley's birthday. It was risky to even look at Dudley's jealously guarded presents. The newest of which had long since left the driveway. The neighbours had gathered in the front garden as Dudley, blind-folded with a tea towel, was lead out by his parents. Mr Dursley removed the towel with a flourish as he asked, \"Do you like it?\" Anyone else would have loved the brand new red car parked in the driveway. Dudley said, \"Where's the roof?\" Mrs Dursley gave Mr Dursley a worried look. \"It's a convertible Dudley, it doesn't have a proper roof.\" \"It's got a bit missing! I want a whole car, whole cars have proper ROOFS!\" Parents and neighbours took an instinctive step backwards. \"But Diddy dollops,\" flustered Mrs Dursley, \"this costs more than a car with a roof. \"Roof! Now!\" Then Harry broke his own rule and said, \"Why now? You're not old enough to drive it for two years!\" Immediately the Dudleys decided that someway, somehow, this was all Harry's fault. As one they turned towards him. \"Yep,\" he thought, \"I really should have kept quiet.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
