The Nottinghamshire-based former champion took his first back-to-back victories for almost two years but it made little impression on Shane Byrne's lead in the championship, with the Monster Mob Ducati rider still 135 points clear of his Rizla Suzuki rival. After two charging rides from second-row starts, Reynolds said: \"This is really sweet. They were hard races, but good fun.\" Kawasaki's Glen Richards and then Virgin Mobile Yamaha's Gary Mason had led the opening race with Reynolds in pursuit and moving through into second place at halfway. After stalking the leaders Reynolds completed his charge to win by a just over a second from Sean Emmett, with Yukio Kagayama back in third. \"I had worked out where I could take the lead, and had been sizing Gary up for three or four laps, and when the opportunity came I was ready to take it - winning is fantastic,\" Reynolds said. Kagayama, also riding for Rizla Suzuki, made the running in race two but his team-mate Reynolds was soon on his tail, running second after seven laps and then building the pressure before taking the lead on the penultimate lap. It seemed set for a Suzuki one-two but Kagayama crashed out on the final lap with the series leader Byrne, a distant ninth in the opener, inheriting second place ahead of Richards. Byrne said: \"I needed that - in the first race my brake lever was damaged in a first-corner tangle and that slowed me. We made changes for the second and they helped.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
