In seven heady minutes late in the first half Middlesbrough scored three times, through Noel Whelan, Szilard Nemeth and Paul Ince, to reach the FA Cup semi-finals for only the second time in their history. For Walter Smith, the condemnation is growing and he left the dugout to chants of \"Walter must go\". Everton's defensive certainty has been their one saving grace in a blighted season, but yesterday even that deserted them. A battle against relegation is now all that awaits them. Smith was characteristically defiant. \"It will be a grim fight for all of us, and I intend to handle it,\" he said. \"Criticism comes with the territory.\" Nothing affects a side so over-reliant as Everton on defensive stability than a bad goal conceded and the blunder by their goalkeeper, Steve Simonsen, 10 minutes before half-time sent them into such rapid decline that Smith's third quarter-final defeat became inevitable. Paul Ince's punt forward from the centre circle, as a malicious wind was momentarily still, should have provided a simple header back to his goalkeeper for Alessandro Pistone, but Simonsen, instead of holding his position on the six-yard line, dashed madly towards him. As Pistone's header duly flew past Simonsen, Noel Whelan was able to trot in for the tap-in. Simonsen's strop around his area, tapping his index finger to his head, was a desperate attempt to cast blame where it did not belong. Everton, ravaged by injury, were dismally aware of their attacking impotence: four goals in their past 12 Premiership games. Their front two of Tomasz Radzinski and Joe-Max Moore had rarely gained the ball, never mind retained it. They attacked in a confusion of numbers and, within two minutes, they conceded a second. Whelan, whose self-confidence has returned during Middlesbrough's run of one defeat in 12 matches, ploughed through the middle. The first chance fell to Alen Boksic, free on the right, whose deft chip over the onrushing Simonsen came back off the bar. The follow-up, from a yard out, belonged to Nemeth. Middlesbrough might have led after a quarter of an hour when Ince's inswinging corner had found extra curl on the breeze and Nemeth had almost turned in Gianluca Festa's far-post header. Smith had left Jesper Blomqvist on the bench and informed David Ginola he was not needed (\"He did not storm out, there was no Gallic flourish and I expect him in training on Tuesday,\" said Smith - although one wonders to what purpose). Hopes were that Paul Gascoigne, these days interesting the likes of Burnley and Bristol City, might somehow turn saviour. But Gascoigne's quick feet have long been attached to a ponderous body, and his twists and turns found Boro players eager to harry. It was from one such loss of possession by Gascoigne that Boro broke away for a third. Jonathan Greening, his young assailant, raced away, Everton's defence backtracked, and after Boksic dinked the ball past Simonsen, Ince touched it over the line. Ince's double cartwheel behind the goal enraged some Everton supporters and police made several arrests as the half drew to a close. There was a lot of rubbish on the pitch, and in the first half the crisp packets had made more forward runs than Everton. The sum of their first-half attacking efforts amounted to a wild 30-yard drive by David Weir, a central defender; things could only get better. They did, slightly, but an Everton side that had scored three against Premiership opposition only once this season were realistically spent. Smith tried to pep things up with Nick Chadwick and Niclas Alexandersson. Schwarzer blocked Alexandersson's shot after the pair combined and Radzinksi shot straight at the goalkeeper when well placed. Everton's supporters watched it all with stony faces.
