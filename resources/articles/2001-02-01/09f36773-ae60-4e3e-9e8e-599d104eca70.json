English Literature, like Nietszche's God, the dodo, Queen Anne and mutton, is dead. According to leaks (from disgruntled bardolaters, one must suspect), there are plans to ditch \"Shakespeare and the entire English literary canon\" from the GCSE syllabus. And in their place will come \"media studies\", \"the moving image\", \"information reading\" and \"synchronised thumb-twiddling\" (I made that last one up, as Simon Hoggart would say). In other words: out with Will, in with Quentin Tarantino, MTV, EastEnders, tabloid front pages (page 3, for sixth-formers), goal of the week, World Wrestling Federation, and advanced website skills. It may be possible, if this grotesque reform comes to pass, that young people will prepare for their GCSE exam in \"cultural studies\" (as English will be renamed) without ever turning a printed page. Brave new world (a Shakespearean quotation; as meaningless as ancient Greek to the pupil of the future, presumably). It is by no means clear that this proposed vandalism from the policymakers in the qualifications and curriculum authority (QCA) is anything more than someone's brainwave. It will almost certainly come to nothing. But, whether or not this reform (as some idiot must think it) is ever put into practice in its entirety, it signals an irresistible trend towards \"relevance\" by the curriculum-makers at Whitehall. The thinking behind replacing Shakespeare and those other fuddy-duddy \"classics\" seems to be: \"If we are going to oblige our kids to spend all those years at school, for God's sake let them do something that connects with the real world in which they are going to spend the rest of their lives.\" Even in New Labour's new millennium, not every young person will go to university. Do the tinkers, tailors, soldiers and sailors of our modern age really need to understand what Shakespeare meant by: \"Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back/Wherein he puts alms for oblivion.\" (You're not sure what it means? Imagine \"oblivion\" as a street beggar selling the Big Issue, and alms as the quid you give him). My own view is knee-jerk old-fashioned. Not surprising, perhaps. Canonical literature is my bread and butter. Browning, yes; but I'm not sure I could teach Eminem - at least, not well enough to keep the students in the classroom. I will argue to my dying (well, retiring) day that Shakespeare should be studied, at GCSE level and after, not because he is accessible - but because he's inaccessible (without the help of me and my teacher colleagues, I'm too modest to stress). I can happily go along with some imaginative window-dressing: as in the Leo DiCaprio-starring Romeo + Juliet, transplanted as it was to the American barrio. Difficulty is the point. Learning how to understand Shakespeare through the ear is as valuable a skill as touch-typing or auto-ed (car mechanics. Both of these handy subjects are taught in American schools. They would be a much more valuable addition to the young Briton's syllabus than media studies. It is not all that easy to master basic roadside repairs. Nor is it easy to get your fingers up to 50 wpm. Nor is it easy to work out what is being said in some of the more opaque passages in Shakespeare (try the opening speech in Measure for Measure for masterclass points, or any speech in Troilus and Cressida). All three skills have their lifelong uses. The abolition of Shakespeare in GCSE English (the most widely taken paper) would leave a gaping socket. It would not be filled by films such as Shakespeare in Love, or 10 Things I Hate About You. And the loss of the 39 plays would not be adequately substituted for by media studies - useful as that unfairly reviled subject can sometimes be. One doesn't have to argue the merits of Shakespeare. They proclaim themselves, \"trumpet-tongued\" (can you place the phrase? Macbeth). But, if relevance is the cry, it is easy to come up with a barrage of Shakespeareanisms to fit the news of the day. How about this, for Peter Mandelson, from Richard III. Buckingham has made Blair (oops - I mean Gloucester) king of England. He masterminded the campaign. He was the ambitious man's \"ladder\". Having ascended the throne, Richard III haughtily dismisses his consigliere when he craves some small boon (\"I am not in the giving vein\"). \"And is it thus?\" asks the spurned, and soon-to-be-executed, favourite: \"repays he my deep service With such contempt? Made I him king for this?\" Nothing changes, Peter. At least, a couple of years on, Crookback will get his. Too late for you, alas. How about this (from All's Well) for the editorship of the Daily Express? \"It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks.\" And for the porn channel, that is now the Express's new stablemate: \"Come: commit the oldest sins the newest kind of way\" (Henry IV, 2). For the unspeakable Professor van Velzen, Alder Hey's corporeal kleptomaniac, one can suggest: \"Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade\" (Measure for Measure), and from Macbeth, this prophecy: \"Pity, like a naked new-born babe, striding the blast ... shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, That tears shall drown the wind.\" So did the nation's tears, when they learned the detail of the Dutchman's trade. For Gordon Brown, as he devises yet newer and more stealthy way to make us poor: \"Let us take any man's horses; the laws of England are at my commandment\" (Henry IV, 1). One could devise a whole Tory manifesto from Jack Cade's visionary speech in Henry VI, 2: \"There shall be in England seven halfpenny loaves sold for a penny; the three-hooped pot shall have 10 hoops; and I will make it a felony to drink small beer.\" To which his henchman Dick replies (Jeffrey Archer would probably agree): \"The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.\" For gabby John Prescott, \"Men of few words are the best men\" (Henry V), and for moth-eaten Michael Douglas with his beautiful young partner, Catherine: \"Is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance\" (Henry IV, 1). I can't lay my hand on any bardic anticipation of Viagra. One can fill any number of motto calendars, or embellish almost any news story, with an apt quotation from Shakespeare. He is, to paraphrase Erasmus's praise of Sir Thomas More, a writer for all seasons. (How long before Shakespeare is as unread as musty old Erasmus?) There are serious issues raised by any attempt to demote or marginalise Shakespeare in the syllabus. Anyone who works in education will have perceived over the past two decades a persistent drift towards easy courses. Fun things to study. It is easy to see how this drift happens. Optionality, in a word. If you give students the choice, they will, naturally enough, do subjects that appeal to them -- English or history, rather than maths or chemistry. We seek pleasure and avoid pain, in intellectual pursuits as in everything else. The same tendency works within subjects and disciplines. If, in a degree course, you give undergraduates the option of working on Beowulf or Toni Morrison, a majority will go for the contemporary American novelist, rather than the Anglo-Saxon epic. If you offer a choice between Nick Hornby and Toni Morrison, a majority will go for Hornby. And if, as is now happening, you charge undergraduates fees - effectively transforming them from disciplined students into customers, you empower them to demand \"what they like\", and avoid what you (as instructor) may in your crusty wisdom think good for them. The customer (\"student\") is always right. Eventually, optionality abolishes the subject altogether. It is easier to watch soaps than it is to master Shakespeare. One of the few ways we have left of \"making\" pupils and students do what they do not want to do is exams. Which is why Shakespeare must stay. Or, as Falstaff would say: \"banish Shakespeare and banish all the world.\" Say it ain't so, QCA, say it ain't so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
