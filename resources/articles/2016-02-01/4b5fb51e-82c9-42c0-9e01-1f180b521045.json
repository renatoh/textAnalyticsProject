Eddie Jones has been actively trying to work his squad harder since taking over and as they prepare for their next match against Ireland the Saracens lock George Kruis believes there has been a significant step up compared with the Stuart Lancaster era. A feature of England\u2019s opening two wins against Scotland and Italy has been their final-quarter superiority and Kruis, among England\u2019s best forwards to date, suggests more attention to detail is also paying dividends. \u201cIt is different,\u201d Kruis said. \u201cThe intensity is a bit higher. The way it\u2019s structured there are no breaks in the session \u2026 everything is well planned. There\u2019s more detail within it. You aren\u2019t waiting for someone to go and pick up the bags, you\u2019re moving on to the next drill. It\u2019s just not off the cuff. \u201cIf you are going to do that for the whole season it would be tough but your body gets used to the demands. The harder you train, the more you feel you put into it and the end result is a better one. It showed in the last 20 minutes against Italy. Eddie\u2019s trying to put pressure on us to be prepared, so we are ready for any scenario. Ultimately, it is the best way to coach it because if something happens on the field, he is not going to be there.\u201d England will play Ireland at Twickenham next weekend with the Six Nations champions struggling and beset by injury concerns. On Friday they lost three more players for the duration of the tournament, with the lock Mike McCarthy ruled out for the season on the advice of a specialist following the concussion he sustained against France. Joe Schmidt confirmed McCarthy would likely be joined on the sidelines by Sean O\u2019Brien and Dave Kearney for the remainder of the Six Nations, with hamstring and shoulder injuries respectively. The Ireland coach offered a more upbeat assessment of Jonathan Sexton\u2019s fitness after the fly-half, who has had concussion concerns of his own in the buildup to the tournament, rolled his ankle in a public training session. \u201cHe could have trained on,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cIn the end we sent him to the side. He did all the initial stuff but most of what we were going to do was broken play work, so we didn\u2019t really need him in there.\u201d Jones has also suggested players outside his matchday 23 are short of the fitness levels required for Test rugby and need to aim higher with their clubs. In the middle of a long season it is hard to make significant conditioning gains but changes to the structure of England\u2019s pre-match buildup have been made in an effort to keep the players fresher. England have spent this week away from their familiar training base in Bagshot and have also ceased to undertake the traditional captain\u2019s run at the stadiums on the eve of their matches. So far it has worked and Kruis said the squad are in increasingly good heart before the home matches against Ireland and Wales. \u201cIt\u2019s a good start for a new era and gives us confidence going into these games,\u201d he said. \u201cI honestly think we\u2019re getting somewhere. We\u2019ve talked about wanting to be a brutal English pack and going back to the old days of teams fearing our pack. I think we\u2019re heading in the right direction.\u201d The 25-year-old also believes England\u2019s World Cup hangover is behind them. \u201cI think the majority of the squad have put that to bed now. I think it is definitely a new era. It is in the back of our minds but you cannot keep hanging on to the past. It would be the same if we had won. You can\u2019t hang on to it because it doesn\u2019t affect your next game but we\u2019ve got a point to prove, we\u2019re a confident bunch and we are taking steps in the right direction. Hopefully when we play at home we\u2019ll also get the benefits of the Twickenham crowd and everything that comes with it. Maybe Italy fell off in the last 20 minutes because we pushed them but we wouldn\u2019t expect Ireland to do that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
