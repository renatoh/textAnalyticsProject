AT&amp;T has worked hard to corner this niche of the cell phone market. It gave Apple the freedom to develop the iPhone with minimal carrier input while taking a $900m hit to subsidise new iPhone 3G subscribers. Now AT&amp;T is looking toward the future \u2013 a future two to three years in the making, when its exclusive sales contract for the iPhone runs out, taking away its major competitive advantage. So what is A&amp;T going to offer customers once other cell phone carriers can also sell the iPhone? A specific product alone is not enough to garner customer loyalty in this day and age. Any enterprising individual can crack their phone to work with the cell phone carrier of their choice. A 17-year-old New Jersey resident cracked the iPhone to use it with T-Mobile's network, thus opening the phone to be used on other carriers and overseas. What should set AT&amp;T apart from other carriers selling the iPhone is the service it offers customers. AT&amp;T has long boasted about their rollover minutes and their limited dropped calls. Instead, it ought to start bragging about their internet service now that they're looking for a way to keep customers loyal and interested even after the iPhone is no longer its exclusive show dog. Cell phones have evolved dramatically since their initial inception, and we now do things with our phones that we wouldn't have thought possible a few years ago. Talking is becoming a secondary function. It's just another feature on the already growing list of things that phones can do \u2013 and things that we know they'll be able to do in a few months or years. As email, instant message and texting become more prevalent \u2013 if not already dominant \u2013 AT&amp;T needs to be able to boast about its mobile internet instead of its rollover minutes. AT&amp;T's first priority should be provide users a mobile internet service that rivals the download speed they receive in the comfort of their own home, instead of making them suffer through speeds reminiscent of dial-up internet. We need to be able to check e-mail, update Facebook accounts, get directions or check movie times at a moment's notice. And we need this functionality not with any one specific phone, but with constant and reliable service. The current load-and-wait game is frustrating enough to make customers question if they can find better speeds and service elsewhere. Let's look at another cell phone carrier for a minute. Sprint has attempted to define itself without the use of a trendy phone. This fall, the company used WiMax to debut a new service called Xohm. The service offers download speeds comparable to that of most cable and DSL services, allowing Xohm mobile clients to purchase a phone from Sprint and access the service wherever WiMax is available. This puts Sprint at a price advantage. Their Xohm service is about $15 cheaper per month than the average 3G data plan from AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless. The biggest problem is how limited the service has been thus far, with a network launched only in Baltimore. Even with networks in Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington DC, Providence, Boston and Dallas, Xohm will only be available in a few small pockets of the country. That's hardly an innovative mobile offering. Not surprisingly, there is already speculation that Xohm may be dead within a year, perhaps taking Sprint with it. Other than Sprint's refusal to roll the service out in an efficient manner, however, there's no real reason for Xohm to slowly fade away. But back to AT&amp;T. Thus far, they've announced plans to buy Wi-Fi provider Wayport for $275m in an attempt to speed up their web browsing. In theory, this should allow Wi-Fi enabled phones, such as the iPhone, to automatically jump a Wi-Fi network in range for fast (and free) internet access at places like hotels, airports and even some restaurants. In practice it would be wise to remember that cell phone carriers aren't known for succeeding in this type of endeavour, or developing such drastic network plans with any type of speed, as in the case of Sprint. Regardless of what AT&amp;T may or may not do, their contract with Apple will still run out. And there will still be another phone of iPhone calibre; perhaps the G1 will be enough to give Apple and AT&amp;T a serious run for their money. But it's time that cell phone companies stop thinking about the phone and start thinking about the service they offer, and start acting quickly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
