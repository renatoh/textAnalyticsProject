Sadly though, in recent years the world heritage site has been attracting global attention for all the wrong reasons. Since 2016, around fifty per cent of the coral on the Reef has been impacted through bleaching, a phenomenon which occurs when extreme environmental stresses, such as changes in temperature, disrupt the delicate biological relationships between coral and its symbiotic photosynthetic algae. Across the world, numerous scientists are working to better understand how to manage coral reefs and build resilience into their life cycle, a task which is especially daunting in the face of the ongoing disruption caused by climate change. The sheer body of research is gradually building a bigger picture and bringing us closer to finding solutions as the network of scientific knowledge grows. One such scientist is, PhD candidate and Westpac Scholar, Carrie Sims, who says her career was less a decision, and more an evolution of her interests. Throughout her childhood, Sims\u2019 family fostered her passion for wildlife, for conservation, and for the pursuit of knowledge. She spent her summers bush-walking and birdwatching, camping in forests and near creeks, and immersing herself in the environment. \u201cI think my parents\u2019 love of nature really rubbed off on me. Going to university and conducting research just took that curiosity to a different level,\u201d Sims says. Following her undergraduate degree, Sims moved away from research for a few years; she worked in environmental consultancy where she was able to develop her field work skills and help to implement environmental policy to regulate the use of our natural resources. Her love of learning inevitably tugged her back in to the world of academia, and back to the University of Queensland. \u201cWhat I love about research is that creation of new knowledge. A lot of people think of science and research as being very systematic, but it\u2019s actually a really creative process and I missed that,\u201d she says. \u201cI had also continued to develop an interest in the marine side of things, as well as more of an awareness of the challenges that the reefs were facing - I was interested in becoming part of the solution.\u201d Damaged coral reefs rely on a process known as \u2018coral recruitment\u2019 to regenerate and build a coral reef community. Sims\u2019 doctorate focuses on how different species of coral interact, and how these interactions can influence the successful establishment of newly-arrived coral larvae into the reef community. Each year, coral colonies have impressive annual reproduction events, releasing billions of eggs and sperm which fertilise and develop into larvae. These larvae are dispersed by currents before recruiting into a coral community. Sims studies these events, which are the only time in a coral\u2019s life when it can move. Once a coral larva attaches to a surface (substrate), it must stay there - so selecting a good place to settle is a big deal for a coral larva. She\u2019s trying to discover if where the coral larva chooses to settle and its survival rate once attached is linked to how it interacts with other coral larvae and existing mature coral colonies already present on the reed. Understanding how different factors affect coral recruitment success is vital for ongoing management of the Great Barrier Reef. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the devastating impacts of bleaching, and we know this leads to declines in biodiversity. Coral recruitment is really important for the recovery of reefs, it\u2019s the main process by which they are replenished. It\u2019s a critical link in their persistence.\u201d Although there are many hundreds of research scientists working to comprehend the enormous intricacies of our natural world, each research project is significant. \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing your PhD it can feel really narrow and specific - but one of the analogies I like to tell myself is that I hold a single puzzle piece. On its own it can feel really small, but each piece is important because it\u2019s part of a bigger picture.\u201d Sims firmly believes two of the most important skills a scientist can utilise is communication and collaboration. It\u2019s how those puzzle pieces come together and effect real change. Often, developing these skills can so frequently be undervalued, as the day-to-day complexities - of field work and data analysis - can take up the bulk of a scientist\u2019s headspace and time. The Westpac Future Leaders Scholarship has helped Sims to nurture and develop these vital skills, alongside a network of other inspiring young Australians tackling similar societal issues. \u201cThe Leadership Developmental Program has been really pivotal in providing me with a different set of skills to tackle my doctorate. It\u2019s not just about being a good scientist and researcher, you need to be able to work in a team and tackle complex problems. That sort of development has had a lasting impact on my research and is something I will take with me into my future research endeavours,\u201d she says.
