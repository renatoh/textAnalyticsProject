Many complained that the changes, introduced by the Tories, had been \u201crushed in\u201d, with teachers and students struggling to master demanding new syllabuses, aided by few revision materials. The pressure was compounded by the fact that the new qualifications are solely assessed on end-of-year exams, rather than coursework and AS-levels halfway through. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m a lab rat being tested on,\u201d said one student, who sat economics, geography and biology this summer. \u201cNo past papers. No examiner reports. Misleading specimen papers. No mark schemes. No practice. It\u2019s been awful. So much relies upon these results, and I\u2019m terrified.\u201d Responding to a Guardian call-out to readers, students who got in touch said a number of errors and alleged leaks of papers during the exam season had added to the stress of the ordeal. There was also concern about having to sit a mixture of old and new A-levels as the amended qualifications are gradually rolled out. New A-levels in 13 subjects were examined this summer. The rest have remained the same. Beyond results day on Thursday, many students expressed fears about the cost of going to university, with increasing tuition fees and student debt. \u201cGrades are one thing, but frankly it\u2019s student loans I\u2019m worried about,\u201d said one A-level candidate from Manchester. \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have to bother, but I need a degree. I feel like the punchline of a very cruel joke.\u201d The exams watchdog Ofqual has reassured this year\u2019s A-level cohort they will not be disadvantaged by the new qualifications. Even if performance drops, the principle of comparable outcomes will be used to ensure that this year\u2019s national results are similar to last year\u2019s. Julie Swan, Ofqual\u2019s executive director for general qualifications, explained: \u201cWhile the subject content has been updated to support students\u2019 progression to higher education, the level of demand of the content and its volume have not changed. \u201cThe exam boards will use statistical predictions when setting grade boundaries, making sure this year\u2019s students are not disadvantaged because they are the first to take the qualifications. So a student who might have expected to get a grade B last year, for example, should expect to get a grade B this year.\u201d But many who contacted the Guardian remained anxious. \u201cThe level of uncertainty is huge, which makes the stress and pressure immense,\u201d said one student who sat history, physics and maths this summer. \u201cSupport from the exam boards has been laughably non-existent.\u201d She said she had suffered a panic attack during a maths paper (which was not among the amended A-levels) on one of the hottest days of the year in a packed hall with no air conditioning. \u201cSince the paper was possibly leaked, we are also all afraid that the exam boards will hike up the grade boundaries and we will be collectively punished. \u201cFor physics [which is among the new, amended A-levels], we had two specimen papers, released very close to exam time, with no grade boundaries, so we had no idea how well we had done. It\u2019s a complete scandal that exam boards can release a specification with absolutely no preparation or guidance. \u201cA-levels were, without exaggeration, the worst month of my life,\u201d she went on. \u201c I have frequent dreams about results day and get stress headaches even more than a month after, and this is really common in all my friends. I\u2019m terrified.\u201d Daniel Molland from Arundel, West Sussex, sat biology, chemistry and English language. His papers for both biology and chemistry contained errors, but this worried him less than the lack of revision materials. \u201cAny student will tell you that exam practice using old papers is so important, but with the new specification there were hardly any resources aside from one or two sets of practice papers,\u201d said Molland. \u201cThis made exam practice for everyone much harder, especially seeing as the exam boards really changed the style in which they ask their questions now, with a lot more emphasis on understanding than blind recall.\u201d Molland, who is hoping to go to King\u2019s College London, said there was \u201cmassive confusion\u201d over grade boundaries. \u201cBeing the first year we don\u2019t really know what the grade boundaries will be. Our teachers can mark our work, but they don\u2019t have a clue what grade to give it without any data on these boundaries.\u201d On the errors in some papers, he said the exam boards\u2019 apparent inability to check exam papers properly \u201chas just further decreased our trust and respect for them. Which is sad, because these new A-levels do offer some really good and interesting content.\u201d Lorcan Canavan, of Woodford Green, north-east London, sat new, linear qualifications for English literature and history, but the old modular syllabus for politics. \u201cThe main issue has been a lack of communication between exam boards and schools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really feel like guinea pigs for these new, linear specifications. \u201cAnother issue has been the fact that our year has been a transitional year. Some qualifications are linear, but some are modular. This has made it very difficult for subject departments to coordinate, especially with regard to mock exams.\u201d Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it had been an unprecedented year of qualification reform. \u201cWe always knew that this would be a volatile year for examinations \u2013 a result of hasty reform that has put huge pressure on students, teachers and school and college leaders. \u201cBut we also know that the overall level of exam errors \u2013 for example, misprints in papers \u2013 doesn\u2019t appear greater than in previous years. Young people are bound to worry about results, especially in the midst of so much change, and in an age when social media can make it easier for individual cases to gain disproportionate attention.\u201d Nevertheless, he said there were lessons to be learned and there would be a serious examination postmortem with Ofqual\u2019s chief regulator, Sally Collier. Some students who got in touch were worried about the impact of the exams on their mental health. One student, who sat biology, chemistry and English literature and is hoping to study medicine, said: \u201cI have put most of what I had into these exams. I was racked with anxiety and insomnia which meant I was battling with keeping my sanity during exam season. With these reformed subjects you walk in blind \u2013 you have no cash-ins from AS. You have virtually nothing.\u201d Ellie Dixon-Coyte from Kent, who took history, classics and fine art and is hoping to study classical civilisation at Durham University, said the reforms had particularly affected her history studies. \u201cSo much was crammed into the specifcation that my teachers struggled to fit it all in,\u201d she said. Her teachers had to mark papers \u201cwith no context for how examiners will mark them, and we students have had to write essays in the dark. Since there are no grade boundaries, figuring out what grade I am likely to get is like throwing a dart at a revolving board \u2013 completely unpredictable.\u201d One student who is applying to study medicine was thrown by an error in the OCR biology paper. \u201cThey say it was only one question which had a mistake. But that one question affects your entire mind during the exam, altering your stress levels during an already high pressure period of time.\u201d He was also affected by alleged leaks of papers. \u201cThe leaks make you more worried about your results, as students with the means to cheat have an advantage in what was already an extremely difficult exam. \u201cA-levels were not a level playing field this year compared with last year. We had to learn everything in the two years of sixth form, followed by a new questioning style. We didn\u2019t have enough past papers and had to rely solely on our instincts during our exams.\u201d Another student from Bristol is hoping to go to university, but is worried about the toll GCSEs and A-levels have already taken on her mental health. \u201cA-levels are not about learning \u2013 they are about grasping techniques to pass exams. By the end of the year, we were all walking zombie-robots, conditioned to succeed in exam conditions but exhausted, drowning in stress.\u201d One London student said: \u201cI am grateful I only had one reformed subject (history) as it really is very hard to learn that volume of content. Unreformed A-levels are by no means easy, but the government obviously didn\u2019t listen to students and teachers when passing the reforms. \u201cI also don\u2019t think it was clever to change the grading system of GCSEs [from A* to G to 9 to 1] at the same time as the A-levels, as teachers are obviously incredibly stressed about having to deal with changes to both key exam years.\u201d While A-level results are expected to be broadly stable despite the upheaval for those taking them, GCSE results on 24 August are likely to be far more problematic because of the new grades. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve reformed A-levels to keep pace with universities\u2019 and employers\u2019 demands, so students are as well prepared as possible for work and further study. \u201cWe would always want exams to be error-free, but occasional errors do happen. Ofqual is working closely with the exam boards to mitigate the impact of errors and leaks this year and ensure that results are fair to all students.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
