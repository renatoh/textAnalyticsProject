A number of fans made their feelings known throughout the game, with Will Hughes\u2019s opening goal in the 11th minute greeted with a chorus of \u201csack the board\u201d as West Ham made a nightmare start under the Scot in his first appointment since leaving Sunderland early last summer. Andy Carroll was also singled out for criticism by a large section of away supporters when he was withdrawn in the second half soon after Richarlison had doubled Watford\u2019s lead and Moyes, who replaced Slaven Bilic as manager during the international break, admitted they will have to get behind the team if West Ham are to rescue themselves from their second-worst start to a Premier League season. \u201cI don\u2019t know the history and all the reasons for it but I have to say we need them now,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe need a united club. I know that\u2019s hard if you have grievances but I said to the players at the end that it\u2019s hard to play when the crowd\u2019s like that. The small things can make a big difference but I can understand their frustration because we didn\u2019t play well enough. We need to find a way to make sure we get the club together.\u201d Moyes, who is looking to relaunch his career after disappointing experiences at Manchester United, Real Sociedad and Sunderland, pointed the finger at West Ham\u2019s \u201cbig names\u201d. \u201cI always thought this was a big job,\u201d he said. \u201cSome big players with big reputations disappointed me a lot. I thought they would show me more. They need to show me why they have got that reputation. Overall it was not good enough.\u201d Watford, who ended their run of three successive defeats under Marco Silva, fully deserved their victory despite heroics from the goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes when he twice denied West Ham an equaliser. But the Portuguese manager was noncommittal over whether he will still be in charge for Saturday\u2019s trip to Newcastle following reports that he is Everton\u2019s main target to succeed Ronald Koeman at Goodison Park, with two attempts to agree a compensation fee already believed to have failed. \u201cWhat I can control and what stays in my hands is to plan the next session tomorrow and I will be at the training ground tomorrow,\u201d Silva said. \u201cI know the speculation and some of you put in doubt about my commitment but my players gave a very good answer today. I don\u2019t want to talk anything more about the situation. What I can control is my team and I will be at training for the next session on Monday.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
