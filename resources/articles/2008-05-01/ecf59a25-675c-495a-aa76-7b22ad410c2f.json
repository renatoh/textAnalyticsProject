Price \u00a312.99. Age 10-13 Eva Ibbotson is renowned for her depiction of timeless heroines whose endearing mixture of capable common sense, compassion and integrity makes them readily likable. Here it is Tally, daughter of a loving but overworked doctor, who, in 1939 with war approaching, finds herself summarily dispatched to boarding school. There she encounters, not the stuffy set-up her snooty cousins have led her to expect, but a lively, forward-thinking environment where children are treated as responsible individuals - and lessons are optional. Outsiders deplore the school's haphazard approach but, for its pupils, the mutually supportive atmosphere offers an emotional and spiritual refuge. Its philosophy and Tally's benevolence are, however, put to the test on a school trip to a tiny (fictional) European kingdom under threat from Nazi Germany. The idea of the courageous and principled individual who can make a difference to the lives of those around her has a long-standing appeal in children's literature; Tally's morality, her passion and her courage place her firmly in the mould of its best-loved heroines. Tally's adventures may from time to time require us to suspend disbelief, but we do so willingly and in appreciation of the sure-footed skill of an author whose novels have the skill and stature of classics in the making."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
