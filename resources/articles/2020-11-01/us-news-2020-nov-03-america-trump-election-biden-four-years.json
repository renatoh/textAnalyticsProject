But as the night wore on, the numbers grew and so did belief in miracles. In the early hours of 9 November 2016, Donald Trump and family walked into the ballroom of a midtown Manhattan hotel to celebrate one of the greatest political upsets of all time. \u201cNow it is time for America to bind the wounds of division \u2013 have to get together,\u201d the new president-elect said. \u201cTo all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.\u201d The speech is now all the more striking because, in the view of countless critics, Trump spent the next four years doing precisely the opposite. His norm-busting presidency deepened divisions, poured oil on flames, stress-tested institutions to breaking point and rendered truth itself a partisan issue. And on Tuesday, millions of Americans will deliver their verdict in a referendum on Trump\u2019s first term, after a bitterly fought election campaign that has left the nation with even deeper wounds than those exposed four years ago. Trump\u2019s opponent, former vice-president Joe Biden, has left the president trailing in every major national opinion poll since becoming Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee in April. Biden commands a bigger lead over Trump, nationally and in several crucial battleground states, than the ill-fated Hillary Clinton did at the same stage in 2016. Yet the stunning repudiation of the political establishment that year has left Democrats haunted. There is little sign of complacency in the Biden camp amid the profound uncertainties of an election campaign waged against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, and fears that the incumbent will seek to declare victory prematurely and prevent every vote being counted. As both candidates spent Monday in a final frenzied sprint across battleground states, Trump was in trouble. Past incumbents have successfully made elections about not themselves but their opponents. George W Bush shifted the spotlight to challenger John Kerry. Barack Obama did likewise to Mitt Romney. But this president\u2019s profligate and shambolic campaign could neither escape the pandemic nor find a way to define Biden. It is still all about Trump. On inauguration day in 2017, the property tycoon and reality TV star filed the paperwork to be an official candidate for re-election, earlier than any incumbent in history. The move enabled him to hold rallies paid for by his campaign and raise more than $13m in the first three months of the year. The intention was to lock in a financial and organisational advantage that no Democrat could match. Just over a year later, Trump appointed Brad Parscale, a bearded, 6ft 8in digital guru, as campaign manager. By March 2019, based in flashy headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, the campaign boasted a massive war chest of more than $100m, the backing of the Republican party\u2019s organisational heft, and purportedly the most sophisticated political data operation ever seen. Fast forward to February 2020 and Democrats were still searching for a challenger while their attempt to remove Trump from office in an impeachment trial foundered in the Republican-controlled Senate. The president stood in the White House and held aloft a Washington Post front page that declared \u201cTrump acquitted\u201d, oozing confidence that a robust economy would secure his re-election. But by then the Covid-19 pandemic was already raging around the globe. February would prove to be a catastrophically wasted month for America. Trump failed to build a national testing and contract tracing strategy and deliberately downplayed the threat, insisting that the virus would disappear \u201clike a miracle\u201d. Biden, who had limped in fourth and fifth in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary respectively, had almost dropped out of the race. But he pulled off a spectacular comeback in South Carolina, and went on to win the Democratic primary race. From day one, Biden had cast his candidacy as a \u201cbattle for the soul of the nation\u201d against the president. Faced with such high stakes, the party avoided the factional infighting that dogged Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016, and fell in line behind the moderate 77-year-old presidential nominee. After a long life of personal traumas and political setbacks, the stars had aligned for Biden\u2019s third attempt to run for president. The former senator and vice-president\u2019s wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car crash in 1972. His adult son, Beau, died from brain cancer in 2015. After the first two failed runs, he opted not to try again in 2016. But as the 2020 election approached, Biden said he could not stand by. And when the pandemic hit, his message began to resonate more keenly. Coronavirus has now killed more than 225,000 people in the US, infected more than 9 million people, and left millions of others jobless. A staggering 54 million people in the US \u2013 ostensibly the richest country in the world \u2013 may go hungry by the end of the year, according to Feeding America. In August, Biden told the country that the tragedies in his own past made him the right person at the right time for a grieving, humbled, divided America, his empathy contrasting with Trump\u2019s narcissism on the campaign trail. Biden pledged to restore sanity after four years that made the country an object of ridicule and pity. \u201cWe are fearful and we are angry and we are in pain,\u201d Jon Stewart, the satirist and film director, observed in June. \u201cAnd when I see Biden, past the shtick, I see a guy who knows what loss is. Who knows grief \u2026 and what I think in this moment this country needs is a leader of humility that understands that he doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d Biden smashed fundraising records with $365m in August and $383m in September. The Trump campaign, which had a $200m lead when Biden became the presumptive nominee, squandered that advantage by lavishing $800m on everything from Super Bowl ads and lawyers to banner-pulling planes and a car and driver for Parscale, the New York Times reported. In July, Parscale was demoted and replaced by Republican political operative Bill Stepien. Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist who was an adviser to the Al Gore and John Kerry presidential campaigns, said: \u201cThey blew almost a billion dollars before the Republican convention, which is unthinkable. They wasted apparently tons of money cosseting people. The idea that I ever would have asked for a chauffeur-driven car for a presidential campaign is preposterous. It\u2019s been the equivalent of Donald Trump\u2019s casinos. It went belly-up.\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cbase-first\u201d re-election strategy, in which he has attempted to energise his most fervent and radical supporters, has seen him repeatedly deny the severity of the pandemic, stoke racist sentiments and culture war issues, and cast liberals as \u201csocialists\u201d hell-bent on \u201ca merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children\u201d. Trump\u2019s attacks on mail-in voting and his claims \u2013 without evidence \u2013 of widespread voter fraud have prompted critics from across the political spectrum to accuse the president of spreading disinformation, sewing distrust in key institutions, and harming the democracy he is sworn to protect. But three moments of his own making may go down in history as key mistakes if Trump does not win the White House again. First, on 1 June, security forces chased away peaceful anti-racism protesters with brute force and teargas outside the White House before Trump staged a photo op, awkwardly clutching a Bible outside a historic church. It was widely viewed as a crass flexing of \u201claw and order\u201d muscles that misjudged the national mood following the police killing of George Floyd, whose death had prompted a national reckoning on racism. Second, Trump offered a disastrous performance in the first debate, interrupting Biden dozens of times and alienating moderate voters who did not like the president\u2019s aggressive style. The Democrat gave a solid and unspectacular show, channeling the frustration of may supporters when he said: \u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d Third, the president tested positive for Covid-19 in October, a vivid display of chickens coming home to roost. Instead of learning any lessons, he claimed his recovery proved that the virus\u2019s danger is being exaggerated. After three nights in hospital he flew back to the White House, stood on a balcony, puffed out his chest \u2013 and took off his mask. At rallies and in interviews, the president continued to trample on his own message. He spread disinformation about Biden\u2019s son Hunter, an effort to repeat the formula that worked against Clinton but failed to gain traction among sceptical media outlets that were once bitten twice shy. Trump nodded and winked at the QAnon conspiracy theory, described as a domestic terror threat by the FBI. He also tried to sow doubt about the legitimacy of the election and threatened to deploy lawyers to challenge the outcome. Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 had convinced him to do it his way again. Rick Gates, deputy campaign chairman four years ago, said: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of deja vu. Putting the issues aside for a minute, it\u2019s the same approach he had 2016. As advisers we were all frustrated with some of the things he didn\u2019t say and some of the things he did say that we didn\u2019t feel in the end were going to resonate well with the voters. \u201cBut the one thing that I learned in 2016, and I see it every time I turn on the TV and watch him, is his instincts for this stuff are unparalleled. He has a sense of what the people react to, how they react, and he\u2019s able to communicate directly with them through these rallies.\u201d But Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican national committee, disagreed. \u201cThe president has been his own worst enemy in a lot of this, which I know had frustrated a number of folks on his campaign because he goes out and he\u2019s counter-programming against himself, which is typical Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president has yet to make a case for his re-election. He\u2019s had two debates and in neither debate has he done it.\u201d Trump\u2019s 2016 effort was no less volatile or prone to shedding campaign managers but succeeded in finding a narrative thread on trade, immigration (\u201cBuild that wall!\u201d) defining his opponent (\u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d) and a resonant brand (\u201cMake America great again\u201d). But this time the novelty had worn off and the media had wised up. The 2020 version invited comparisons with a TV show that has gone on one season too many, run out of ideas and is facing cancellation. Shrum, director of the University of Southern California Dornsife Center for the Political Future, commented: \u201cThere is no message discipline. Trump doesn\u2019t want to talk about Covid so what does he do? Stand up and start saying, \u2018Covid, Covidl Covid!\u2019. \u201cHe seems to go on instinct. Now, his instinct in 2016 hit the moment by a very small margin as he said to these people in the upper midwest, look, your problem is trade and immigration, and he talked all the time about trade and immigration. He\u2019ll mention them occasionally now but they\u2019re not issues in the campaign. He\u2019s been all over the lot.\u201d Opinion polls suggest the verdict of the voters could be damning. Older people and suburban women in particular appear have turned against him. Outspent on TV, his last throw of the dice is to barnstorm the country at a frenzied pace. Trump has held almost twice as many rallies as Biden in the final two weeks of the campaign. The president\u2019s events feature mostly maskless crowds with little physical distancing, where the country\u2019s leading scientists are mocked; Biden\u2019s drive-in rallies are smaller in scale to respect public health guidelines. Republicans are hoping that some old political laws still apply and the candidate who appears to be more energised, and drawing bigger crowds, will have the momentum. But critics describe Trump\u2019s rallies as \u201csuper-spreader\u201d events that recklessly put supporters at risk. Biden\u2019s more low-key approach helped reduce his potential to make the gaffes for which he is infamous. Instead he was content to allow Trump to dominate the news cycle. Writing for the Politico website, Alex Thompson observed: \u201cBiden has finally learned, at the tender age of 77, to shut up and stay on message (yes, sometimes by staying in his basement). To nearly everyone\u2019s surprise, he has run one of the most disciplined presidential campaigns in recent memory.\u201d Biden has maintained a laser focus on the pandemic, as the worst-case increases in recent weeks have occurred in the swing states that will decide the president\u2019s fate. Trump insisted that the country was \u201crounding the turn\u201d, even as it hit an all-time high of nearly 100,000 cases in a day, and grumbled that the media was obsessed with \u201cCovid, Covid, Covid\u201d. Former president Barack Obama responded at a rally in Florida last week: \u201cWhat is his closing argument? That people are too focused on Covid. He said this at one of his rallies \u2018Covid, Covid, Covid\u2019, he is complaining. He is jealous of Covid\u2019s media coverage.\u201d Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: \u201cDonald Trump is telling the American people that we\u2019ve turned the corner on Covid at the same time we\u2019re breaking records for daily infections and hospitalisations again. You have the state setting up field hospitals in Wisconsin and Utah and other places in the midwest because of how poorly the Covid response has been handled.\u201d This has been dubbed \u201cthe Armageddon election\u201d, the most important in modern times, perhaps in all American history. Democrats warn that another Trump victory would spell the end of democracy. Republicans warn that a Biden victory would mean the end of America, painting a lurid and unlikely picture of violence, crime and radical socialism. Anxiety is running high over when the result will be known \u2013 and whether Trump will resist it. Biden told a crowd in Philadelphia on Sunday: \u201cEverybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let\u2019s keep showing them who we are. We choose hope over fear. Unity over division. Science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
