A recall petition was set up after Chris Davies, the MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, was convicted of submitting fake expenses documents. He was ousted from the House of Commons after 19% of registered voters in his constituency signed a petition to remove him. A total of 10,005 people signed, well above the 10% threshold needed for a recall. The result, confirmed on Friday by the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, means a byelection will be called, which Davies could stand in. The seat was held by the Liberal Democrats from 1997 until 2015, when Davies won it. He increased his majority in 2017. The Lib Dems have high hopes of winning the seat, which was visited by the party leader, Vince Cable, during the European elections. If the Conservatives lose, the new prime minister\u2019s working majority in the Commons will be reduced to three . At the leadership vote count on Thursday morning, two anonymous MPs spoiled their ballot papers in protest at the choice of candidates, raising questions about whether the next prime minister will be able to command the confidence of the Commons. In recalls, the party in control of the seat \u2013 in this case the Conservatives \u2013 is in charge of moving the writ to determine the timetable of the byelection. If it is issued on Tuesday, that is likely lead to a byelection on Thursday 25 July, the day parliament breaks up for the summer recess, though it could be later if the Tories want to avoid a clash with a leadership election. The timing means the byelection could be held after a new prime minister has been installed. Jane Dodds, the Welsh Lib Dems\u2019 parliamentary candidate for the constituency, said: \u201cThousands of residents across Brecon and Radnorshire have taken the chance to demand better than a Westminster politics that fails to take their concerns seriously. \u201cNow we have a golden opportunity to do things differently. The clear choice in this byelection is between the Conservatives, whose chaos and infighting is letting our communities down, and a better future for our area with the Welsh Lib Dems.\u201d Welsh Labour called on the Conservatives to immediately move the writ in parliament for a byelection. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe recall result is another huge blow to Chris Davies\u2019 credibility to serve as member of parliament. This is a mess all of his making. \u201cNine years of Tory austerity \u2013 enabled by the Lib Dems in the coalition government \u2013 have pushed communities to breaking point. The people of Brecon and Radnorshire deserve a Labour MP who will work every day to make a real difference in their lives. And Wales needs a Labour government in Westminster that will end austerity, invest in our public services and stand up for our people.\u201d A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: \u201cEnsuring those of us who want to see a fresh referendum work together, at every possible level, to deliver this aim is crucial. We will explore options for how we can work together, across party lines, to deliver this in the upcoming Brecon and Radnorshire byelection.\u201d Davies\u2019 conviction was for submitting fake expenses invoices for nine framed landscape photographs, costing \u00a3700, to decorate his office in Builth Wells. He was fined \u00a31,500 and ordered to complete 50 hours of community service. During the sentencing in April, the judge Mr Justice Edis told Davies: \u201cIt seems shocking that when confronted with a simple accounting problem you thought to forge documents. That is an extraordinary thing for a man with your position and your background to do.\u201d Davies declined to speak to the Guardian this week before the petition closed. In a statement on his website, he said what he had done was an \u201cadministrative error\u201d and he had not tried to make any financial gain. \u201cI made a technical breach of a complicated accounts process and fell foul of a new law which is unique to members of parliament,\u201d he said. He has invited constituents into his office to view the documentation and the photographs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
