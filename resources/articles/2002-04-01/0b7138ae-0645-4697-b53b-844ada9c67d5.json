In the first half a high wind that sent top hats flying off the pre-match dancing girls and scattered the tickets for the half time draw, kept the home side in check and they led by a solitary point at the break. But as conditions improved and the Falcons got the measure of some negative Bath tactics, the second period saw four tries without the visitors scoring. Newcastle's director of rugby Rob Andrew was relieved his side finally had the chance to gel, given a fixture programme that ruined any meaningful preparation. Andrew pointed out that his team went two months without a home game and the Six Nations took its toll on his international players. \"We have had this group of players together now for three weeks and it makes a difference,\" he said. \"We needed the five points to keep our European ambitions going.\" Bath pulled off a decisive win against Leeds two weeks ago which might be enough to preserve their Premiership status, but this was a poor showing by surely the worst Bath side in two decades. Their new team director Michael Foley was scathing. \"Our basic skills were deficient and that is the disappointing thing,\" he said. \"The ease with which Newcastle went through our line simply wasn't good enough.\" The visitors stayed in contention in the first period thanks to three penalties by Olly Barkley. They were also helped by the referee Steve Leyshon, who threatened the sin-bin as Bath regularly transgressed, but did not actually produce the card until the 69th minute when the flanker Mark Gabey departed after collapsing a maul. Newcastle's opening try came as the first half drew to a close and after they had established a good platform, Jonny Wilkinson's pass allowing the centre Tom May finally to exploit a gap in the cover. A Wilkinson conversion and penalty completed the first-half scoring. The deficiencies in Bath's defence saw two tries within 10 minutes of the restart by Michael Stephenson and Jamie Noon. With Gabey off the field the visitors' cause was seriously undermined and a bonus point was secured when a long pass by Wilkinson found Liam Botham, who flicked the ball inside for Epi Taione to score under the post. In his last season at the club Inga Tuigamala completed the scoring to great acclaim from the sizable crowd.
