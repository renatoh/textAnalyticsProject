Apparently, because circulation is declining, Jarvis believes that the industry is in \"free fall\". This is not the case. Many papers, including the now broken-up Knight-Ridder chain, posted returns on invested capital in the 10-20% range in 2005. This is the best measure of the long-term health of any business, but one rarely cited. While less than big oil or Microsoft, newspaper returns are more than double the average for other industries. The main causes of panic for the newspaper industry are investor activism and a gullible press (no small irony). The truth is that long-term profitability of newspapers remains quite strong, but this is not enough to satisfy the greed of fund managers who want to post record short-term profits in order to boost their own bonuses. Indeed, circulation declines can lead to higher profit margins for papers over the long term, by lowering production and distribution costs and creating multiple selling channels for content and advertising. Many newspapers are responsible for their own declines in circulation as they have launched websites and free commuter papers. Whatever the future of the newspaper industry, the present panic is a manufactured one - but manufactured crises can have authentic and lasting consequences. Sadly, Jarvis and MediaGuardian have done nothing to clarify facts from arguments, something I once expected of journalists. A Demaso, Toronto Moyles and homophobia Chris Moyles may or may not be anti-gay, but Ben Summerskill does his own cause no favours by alleging that he (Moyles) snorted \"proudly\" that he is \"homophobic\". I heard the same thing on the radio, but I would say that \"sarcastically\" is a better description. Moyles was using the proverbial lowest form of wit to answer critics of his blokeish style. Whether he does indeed undermine the confidence of young homosexuals is still up for discussion, but it is disingenuous to suggest that he has now declared himself a homophobe. John Mitchell, Halifax, Yorks Strictly out of step Has Peter Fincham shot himself in the foot on Saturday nights? His support for Robin Hood seems to have led him to overlook the importance of Strictly Come Dancing as a centrepiece of BBC1's evening. Moving Strictly Come Dancing forward to accommodate Sherwood was a bad idea. The teatime slot for the ballroom extravaganza is at least an hour too early for families settling down for the evening, and doesn't all that razzmatazz make Robin seem drab? Click. Bob Edmands, Chelmsford, Essex The real M&amp;S story? It is questionable whether the advertising campaign is entirely responsible for the increased sales at Marks &amp; Spencer (Go Figure, November 6) because stores such as Littlewoods and C&amp;A catered for similar markets, but as both stores disappeared from our high street, Marks &amp; Spencer was left to benefit from the unfilled gap. So it comes as no surprise that the trading figures at M&amp;S have improved, for given the market conditions they were bound to do so, with or without the advertising campaign.
