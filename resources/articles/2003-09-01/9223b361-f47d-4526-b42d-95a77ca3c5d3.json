Professor Alex Markham also predicted death rates from the four most feared cancers - breast, cervical, bowel and prostate - would tumble in less than a decade, helped by improved screening. But he said more work needed to be done to assess the effectiveness of screening and the NHS's ability to cope with increased demands for treatment. Focusing on bowel cancer, Prof Markham said a national screening programme for the disease was likely to be introduced in the next five years. But speaking at Cancer Research UK's central London HQ, Prof Markham said the roll-out of such a programme would need to be carefully co-ordinated to prevent \"the immediate shock-horror waiting list story\" it might generate. He said: \"There is a possibility that a screening programme could quickly overwhelm current clinical capacity and that would suggest a lack of foresight in the introduction.\" Prof Markham estimated screening could cost around \u00a350m a year, plus the extra costs for clinical practice. With regards to prostate cancer, he pointed to the forthcoming expected extension of the current ProtecT (Prostate testing for cancer Treatment) trial as a possible source of information on how to improve treatment. Launched in 2001 to find the best treatment for early prostate cancer, it involves men aged 50-69 from 400 general practices in nine centres in the UK who are invited for a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test. If ethical permission is given the trial will soon have a new arm of another 400 practices where patients are subject to standard NHS management so that cancer deaths across both groups can be compared after 10 years. \"The new trial will finally reveal whether screening the population for prostate cancer can save lives and if the benefits of screening outweigh the costs,\" Prof Markham said. He also predicted that an extra 600 lives could be saved each year in England and Wales as the breast cancer screening programme is extended to women up to 70. New techniques in cervical cancer screening, such as liquid-based cytology, will mean many more women are prevented from developing the disease. \"We won't do it overnight or alone, but I believe it is possible to have cancer under control in this country in the lifetime of my children's children,\" Prof Markham said. His comments came as Cancer Research UK published its first audited accounts since the merger of the Cancer Research Campaign and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in February 2002. The charity reported an income of \u00a3306m for 2003 - an increase of 9% on the previous year. There were increases in funds raised by regional and national events, such as the Race for Life sponsored runs, in donations and from legacies. But the income from its shops fell by \u00a33m in what the charity called \"a tough year for all retailers\". Lynne Robb, the charity's finance director, said \u00a3191m had been spent on research - an increase of 16%. There was an increase of \u00a312m in spending on grant-funded research, including major new programmes at the Institute of Cancer Research, Bristol and Southampton universities. And \u00a311m was added to the budget for in-house research, including investments in new equipment. Ms Robb said: \"At a time when many charities and research establishments are under real financial pressure, our focus on efficiency has allowed us to deliver most of our increased income directly into our key activity - research.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
