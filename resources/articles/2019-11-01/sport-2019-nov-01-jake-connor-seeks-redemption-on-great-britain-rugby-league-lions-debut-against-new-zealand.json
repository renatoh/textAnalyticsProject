Yet for Jake Connor, who will make his first Lions appearance, there will be wider reasons to ensure everything goes to plan after a season he will be keen to forget thus far. \u201cIt was a nerve-wracking wait for the call-up given everything that\u2019s happened this year,\u201d admits the 25-year-old Connor, who will start in the centres this weekend in place of the injured Oliver Gildart. In Super League, his Hull side looked well-placed for a run at the play-offs midway through this year, before a remarkable end-of-season collapse saw them miss out. The nadir was an embarrassing defeat by Castleford, in which Connor exchanged words with some of his own teammates after being sin-binned for dissent. It left his own coach at Hull, Lee Radford, admitting he needs to calm his on-field temperament, and the player himself fearing he would miss out on a dream trip with Great Britain. \u201cPersonally I didn\u2019t have a great season and given how things finished with Hull, I genuinely didn\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt was a nervous wait, but to get the call and try and finish this year on a high is something I\u2019m relishing. It\u2019s an honour to be involved and, after missing out last week, I\u2019m keen to grab this chance with both hands.\u201d While Connor has established a reputation in Super League for a player who can get under his opponents\u2019 skin, it should not overshadow his mercurial talent. Capable of playing in several positions across the backline has been identified as a major strength in Connor\u2019s game since he was a teenager at Huddersfield: but the player himself admits the utility role is something he is growing tired of. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to the time where I need to work on one position,\u201d he says. He will play centre this week, but the Great Britain coach, Wayne Bennett, believes he has the tools to play half-back at international level, making this a pivotal period in Connor\u2019s fledgling career. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to have a chat when I go back to Hull and see what the plan is there. I\u2019m 25 now, and I need to playing regularly in one role for the good of my own game.\u201d Yet despite such a mixed year \u2013 and constant speculation linking him with a move away from Hull \u2013 Connor will get the chance to end his season on a high: starting this weekend in the first of two Tests against the Kiwis, before a trip to Papua New Guinea. \u201cThe experience has been great and exactly what I needed,\u201d he admits. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of history surrounding Great Britain. To play for England last year was great but this will be doubly special because you don\u2019t know when Great Britain will come around again as a concept. I really want to make the most of it all, and try and help the guys win all three of the games we\u2019ve got left.\u201d The Lions were underwhelming, albeit against an impressive Tongan side, last weekend. With the squad\u2019s senior players vocal about their target to win every game on tour, many are expecting a strong response from Bennett\u2019s side on Saturday against a New Zealand side themselves well beaten by Australia last weekend. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t great, that defeat, and the mood was a bit sour after but we\u2019ve got over it very quickly,\u201d Connor says. \u201cYou don\u2019t come on tours like this expecting to walk into the side, but now the chance is here, it\u2019s up to me. They\u2019re a very strong side, the Kiwis, but we think we\u2019ve got a pretty strong group ourselves here. Just to be still playing after how the season ended in Super League is great for me, though.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
