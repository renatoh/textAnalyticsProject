Sean Long was the key figure on so many occasions in Saints' dominance of their local rivals for the last decade, so this was further compelling evidence that Kyle Eastmond is a worthy successor. The 20-year-old opened the scoring with another of the brilliant individual tries that are so reminiscent of Jason Robinson in his pomp. But it was his goalkicking that provided the crucial difference between the teams, who each scored four tries. Eastmond added four conversions, none of them easy and two of them from the touchline, in addition to two simple penalties, while Warrington managed a single successful goal from their four attempts. \"That's an indication of how dedicated Kyle is,\" said the Saints coach, Mick Potter. \"He practises so hard on his kicking and that's showing in his percentages. I don't think we've seen the best of him yet.\" Maintaining their hold on the Wolves carried the bonus for Saints of leapfrogging them to second in the Super League table, although the manner in which the visitors fought back from a 20-4 deficit to set up a stirring climax left their coach Tony Smith almost as satisfied as Potter. \"If we keep playing like that, we'll stay at the pointy end of the table,\" he said, blaming individual errors for the defeat. They were partly understandable in the driving rain that fell throughout the game but this was not a night that the Wolves full-back Richie Mathers will remember with relish. He was left floundering by Eastmond's sidestep for the first try and was also culpable for each of Ade Gardner's second-half scores, fluffing a high kick in the build-up to the first then missing the chance to bundle him into touch after slick handling by Tony Puletua and Matt Gidley had set the big wing free. Simon Grix had scored Warrington's first-half try and Jon Wilkin and Gardner touched down either side of half-time for Saints. Three tries in the space of seven minutes from Matt King, Ben Harrison and Chris Hicks cut the deficit to 20-18. But Chris Bridge was able to convert only one of them.
