Celtic are believed to be keen on four players \u2013 a centre-back, midfielder, winger and striker \u2013 as they plan for the new campaign. Rodgers, who has seen his career rejuvenated in Glasgow, presided over a Celtic team that did not lose a domestic game all season; Saturday\u2019s 2-1 triumph at Hampden, where Tom Rogic scored an injury-time winner, proved their toughest test. Rodgers speaks routinely about continuing improvement, with European football surely the true barometer of that. As the dust settled on Saturday\u2019s win, Celtic\u2019s manager warned competing with the Champions League\u2019s elite is still a formidable challenge. \u201cYou have to be careful and recognise where we are,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe\u2019re 10 times behind budget-wise. You have to be realistic. \u201cWe want to qualify, first and foremost. That will always be a challenge. Then we have to try and see what we can do. The gauge for us is to measure calmly once we\u2019ve qualified. We would like to be in Europe for the second part of the season, whatever competition that\u2019s in, and that\u2019s a huge, huge ask for a club like ourselves.\u201d Some will smile at Rodgers\u2019 raising of finance, given that Celtic\u2019s spending power dwarfs that of every other club in Scotland. Still, there can be no doubt the former Liverpool manager has raised standards considerably since moving north last summer. Rodgers reflected on the most mentally draining season of his career. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s like as a manager at clubs like Liverpool and Celtic, where the expectations are huge and you have to win,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to impose a way of playing and working which doesn\u2019t just happen with a click of the fingers. So, yes, it\u2019s the pressure which is always there. You just manage it and cope with it. But then there is a part of you which has to press the reset button.\u201d Rodgers is pragmatic regarding the retaining of key players. \u201cFootball is about two things for players \u2013 game time and money,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to give all the fruity answers or nice answers. No, what we can do is create an environment that is fantastic for them to be in. If they decide to move, it\u2019s OK. We\u2019ll fight to keep them but if they don\u2019t want to stay, we\u2019ll find someone else. No problem, someone else will come in and play and hopefully do well for us.\u201d Speculation continues to surround the Aberdeen manager, Derek McInnes, who is among the contenders to succeed David Moyes at Sunderland. Aberdeen\u2019s wait for the Scottish Cup \u2013 they last won it in 1990 \u2013 goes on. \u201cI\u2019ve said it often enough, I love working here,\u201d McInnes said after a game in which Jonny Hayes gave his side a brief early lead. \u201cI think it\u2019s a brilliant club. I feel at home here. It would take something special for me to want to leave.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
