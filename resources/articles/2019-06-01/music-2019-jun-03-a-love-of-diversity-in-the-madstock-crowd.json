I can assure Tim that the majority of the 60,000 fans over that weekend shared Madness\u2019s love of musical, social and ethnic diversity. Incidentally, Morrissey pulled out of the Sunday show after a bad reception the previous night, leaving us with the multiracial Ian Dury and the Blockheads followed by Madness. Great gig. Gavin Alexander New Malden, London \u2022 Terry Eagleton\u2019s review of AC Grayling\u2019s The History of Philosophy (1 June) prompts me to suggest that readers might do better to buy The Story of Philosophy by Bryan Magee, published in 1998 and still in print. It\u2019s a lucid and attractively written illustrated survey, much enjoyed by everyone I have given it to. Catherine Peters Oxford \u2022 While being convicted in absentia is understandable, being jailed in absentia is a difficult concept (Briton jailed in absentia for 1996 murder of film-maker in Ireland, 1 June). Brendan Behan said the IRA tried him in absentia, convicted him in absentia and they could shoot him in absentia. David Beake Budock Water, Cornwall \u2022 We found the nine-letter word easily (Word wheel, G2, 13 May). Corbynate \u2013 it\u2019s a new one to us but we think it means to sit on the fence. Anne and Joe Sempik Beeston, Nottinghamshire \u2022 How about a referendum to decide whether we should have a second referendum? It would help to pass the time until October.
