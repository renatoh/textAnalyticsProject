Scarborough", "bodyText": "Why? I would choose Scarborough because of its amazing coastline running along to Filey. I first went there as a kid on a family holiday, and I've been back many times since. The best thing: The coastline and the bracing air. My perfect day: I'd go walking, and I'd start early. I'd walk all morning around the coastline and up along the top of the cliffs. I'd stop in a little cafe overlooking the sea. Then, I'd retrace my steps, and in the evening I'd head out to eat. My advice: Make sure you pack enough warm clothes. The town sits on the North Sea, and you get a lot of chilly sea mists coming in that can appear without warning. Getting there: From Leeds, take the A64. Where was your best holiday? South Island, New Zealand. I umpired Test matches in New Zealand, and then I would stay on and have a bit of a holiday. What is the best hotel you have ever stayed in? There are two, both in Bombay. The Taj Mahal (tajhotels.com/luxury/tajmahal_mumbai/new.htm) and the Oberoi (oberoihotels.com). Where do you want to go next? In February, I'd like to go to Barbados or Antigua. What do you never travel without? Toothbrush, and a small alarm clock I've had for years. It has old-fashioned hands and is simple to work. \u00b7 Dickie Bird's Britain, the latest book by the former cricket umpire, is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton at \u00a320."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
