The turbulence on the ground is creating even more problems, as yesterday's scenes in the French parliament showed. The prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, accused the Socialist opposition of cowardice after it questioned the delays that have engulfed Airbus's new flagship, leading to a Socialist walk-out, and adding another spark to the smouldering saga surrounding Airbus and its parent company, EADS, that suddenly burst alight. A week ago EADS announced that delivery of the A380 would be further delayed - causing a sudden plunge in the company's share price as the effect of an additional \u20ac2bn loss sank in. The delay came as orders for the A380, which can carry 555 passengers, were proving to be less optimistic than its makers expected, and well below the level needed to recoup the A380's \u20ac12bn cost of development. Its arch-rival Boeing, meanwhile, has gained ground with strong demand for its new 787 Dreamliner, while the international trade dispute between the US and the EU over Airbus's funding rumbles on. Then, to make matters worse, it emerged that Noel Forgeard, EADS's co-chief executive, members of his family and other French company executives, had sold shares in EADS in March, just before two investors said they would sell their large stakes in the company, causing the share price to plummet. French regulators are investigating, and Mr Forgeard said the sale is an \"unfortunate coincidence\". But the affair has made EADS into even more of a political football. In the circumstances, plans to replace Mr Forgeard - a former aide to president Jacques Chirac - with the head of France's national railway SNCF, does not appear wise. Streamlining EADS's unwieldy structure is required, and hard-nosed management is needed for both the A380 and plans for the new A350 to take wing. The events of the last week are a far cry from recent years, when Airbus has boasted of regularly outselling Boeing on international markets. The fact is that designing and building new airplanes is an expensive and drawn-out process, and their record can be measured over decades rather than months. That said, Airbus and EADS have a tough fight ahead of them if the A380 turns out to have been an expensive white elephant. What it needs now is management that is in for the long haul."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
