The decision in that District of Columbia v Heller case, which struck down a local handgun ban, was 5-4. It was also Scalia who last month joined in Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s strongly worded dissent when the supreme court chose not to reconsider a seventh circuit court of appeals decision that an Illinois city\u2019s assault weapon ban was constitutional. \u201cIf a broad ban on firearms can be upheld based on conjecture that the public might feel safer (while being no safer at all), then the Second Amendment guarantees nothing,\u201d the dissent argued. Scalia\u2019s sudden death at age 79 throws the supreme court\u2019s divided stance on the second amendment into question. Dave Kopel, an attorney and gun rights advocate, was part of the legal team that won a historic victory in the Heller case. \u201cPresident Obama has said he believes the second amendment is an individual right, but in terms of what he thinks it protects, it\u2019s a vanishingly small right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe politics of what happens in a confirmation process is unclear, but based on the past, we can expect that he will appoint someone who will pay lip service to the second amendment and then vote to overturn Heller.\u201d Kopel said he testified in the Senate confirmation hearings of justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Sotomayor, he said, \u201ctold the Senate that she considered Heller settled precedent\u201d, but then voted against it \u201cat the first opportunity\u201d, when she joined the dissent in the 2010 McDonald v Chicago case, which clarified that the second amendment individual right established in the Heller case also applied to the states. Since the Heller and McDonald cases, the supreme court has dodged several opportunities to further clarify the scope of the second amendment, prompting questions among legal observers about whether the court had become gun-shy. While the supreme court does not have any cases immediately on deck that involve the second amendment, Kopel said, there are gun rights cases in the pipeline, including the appeal of a second circuit decision upholding assault weapon bans in New York and Connecticut. Scalia\u2019s loss has shifted his perspective on the security of gun rights in the US, he said. \u201cOf course it\u2019s concerning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was only a 5-4 decision.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
