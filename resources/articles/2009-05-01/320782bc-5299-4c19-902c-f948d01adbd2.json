The decision to use high street shops sidesteps the need for the Home Office to set up a network of enrolment centres with mobile units to operate in rural areas. The move comes as the latest Home Office report to parliament on the costs of the scheme show they have risen by a further \u00a3221m to a total of \u00a35.3bn over the next 10 years. That figure excludes the costs to other government departments and agencies of scanners and other equipment for verifying the identity of those trying to access public services. The home secretary is to confirm in a speech today that Manchester will be the first city where citizens \u2013 particularly younger people \u2013 will be invited to apply for an ID card from this autumn before the national roll-out in 2012. They will be charged \u00a330 for a standalone card that will be valid for travel through Europe. Britain's commercial airline pilots are meeting MPs and ministers to object to an initial scheme requiring 20,000 airside workers at Manchester and London City airports to sign up to the ID card scheme as a condition of employment. Smith is to meet businesses today who are keen to sign up with the Identity and Passport Service to undertake the work of recording electronic fingerprints and facial photographs for those who apply for ID cards or a new generation passport. The Home Office expects more than 12m such documents to be issued each year when the scheme is fully operational. \"While private companies will clearly benefit from the increased footfall from offering this service, their customers will benefit from being able to quickly provide their biometrics while they are out doing their shopping,\" said Smith. The Post Office, the National Pharmacy Association and the Photo Marketing Association are all in talks with the Home Office over the contract. The cost report puts the figure for issuing ID cards to British and Irish citizens in the UK at \u00a34.945bn, and to foreign nationals at \u00a3372m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
