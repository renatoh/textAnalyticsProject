In a van parked on board, Boris Becker sits up in the passenger seat, the front row for an almost unnerving blast of postcard beauty: the buttery dying sunlight, the churning surf. He sees none of it. He has lived through enough South Beach springs to take such a vista for granted, and besides, he's distracted. First, there's the young woman in the back of the van, and, yes, Becker is sure he knows why she is there. Haven't months of headlines pronounced him Germany's most famous satyr? Isn't everyone trying to soften him up? Becker takes great pride in his ability to read all the angles, and he figures it's no mistake that every time he goes on a photo session lately, the photographer shows up with an attractive assistant/make-up artist/gofer. A week ago, another photographer brought a female assistant and two women with no apparent task. Next time, they joked, we'll bring 10 girls to help you relax. 'As if that's all I'm interested in,' Becker says. Still, the make-up artist in the back of the van is gorgeous, and the 15-minute ride from Miami Beach to the island goes slowly. Becker twists around to give the young woman his full attention. For a time, he treats her every word as if it were dipped in gold. His heart isn't quite in it, though. Becker trusts no one these days, and the ferry is his most immediate reminder why. He has been making this trip often lately. His sons, seven-year-old Noah and one-year-old Elias, live in a luxury apartment on Fisher Island with his ex-wife, Barbara, and sometimes Becker spends the night there and wakes up like a ghost in what was, only a few months ago, his home. Passing through those rooms, he sees the mundane things he once could lay a hand on and say, 'Mine.' He sees Noah, growing fast. 'This is the one loss I have,' Becker says. 'The fact that I cannot go into the bedroom at night and sneak up on him kills me sometimes. Just to be with him, hold him, smell him...' Instead, on this blustery March afternoon, Becker drifts. At 33, the greatest champion in German history spends most of his time in the air or on the road, jetting from Munich to Majorca to Miami, adding to his $100m fortune, looking to seal the deal that ignites the second act of his life. He looks drawn, thinner than he used to be, and his famous self-confidence comes and goes. Talk in the van drifts to dating. Becker turns back in his seat. Someone jokes that a man is better off getting a prostitute. As the ferry chugs alongside Fisher Island, Becker stares at the thick, green lawns. He nods. 'It's more honest,' he says. 'Because at the end of the day, you always pay.' He waves a weary hand, describing in that feeble arc all he knows and doesn't know about love and women and his own stupidity. 'You see?' Becker says, pointing to the shore. 'That's my old apartment.' Once, Boris Becker was the most important man in tennis. Not just because of his popularity, which reached astounding levels before he retired in 1999. And not just because of his success, though he made huge amounts of money and won plenty of tournaments. In fact, it's easy to discount Becker's stature as one of the game's historic figures: his six Grand Slam singles titles aren't half of Pete Sampras's total. Still, at a time when professional tennis seems to be swimming in a shallow pool, it's clear that the sport misses Becker for reasons beyond gate appeal. Sex has become tennis's driving force: the women sell cheesecake; the men rally under the banner of 'New balls please'. Looks trump talent. Becker flew above all that. In 1984 he arrived at his first Wimbledon at the age of 16 and, after tearing ankle ligaments in his third-round match against Bill Scanlon, insisted on hobbling over to shake his opponent's hand before being carried off on a stretcher. The next year he became the youngest man to win at the All England Club, hurling his massive body at the ball, shouldering past veteran Kevin Curren in the final as if Curren had no right to step on the same grass. A few weeks later, as his fame mushroomed and 200,000 German youngsters flocked to play tennis, the new teen idol told Time magazine that the blind worship he saw in his fans' eyes had him worried. For the first time, Becker said, he understood how Hitler had happened. This, of course, was a dangerous thing for an athlete to say. Becker risked alienating his public just as it was starting to love him, but he didn't care. He wanted to engage the world beyond tennis. 'Those years - '85, '86, '87 - Becker was the most natural, crystal-clear youngster I ever saw,' says Ion Tiriac, Becker's former manager. 'He didn't know how to lie, didn't need to lie, didn't need to find excuses or hype, or cry when he was losing. That's what made human beings around the world identify with him.' On court Becker would curse himself and bleed from the knees, dive on the grass and scream. Off it, he provided a counterpoint to the bombastic Germans seen in one war movie after another. He was a philosopher king in shorts, complaining when British newspapers headlined any of his wins as a blitzkrieg and musing, after losing his Wimbledon crown at 19, 'I didn't lose a war. Nobody died.' He proclaimed solidarity with Amnesty International and with squatters in Hamburg, wore a Greenpeace patch where other players sported sneaker logos. He had charm, an outsized ego and, at times, real guts. In 1992, ignoring his nation's euphoria over reunification, Becker refused to serve as ambassador for Berlin's bid to host the 2000 Olympics, saying he feared a triumphant Germany might stir its citizens' old fantasies about a master race. 'He thinks about the big picture, which is very unusual these days,' says Billie Jean King. 'He's thoughtful, and he cares. Of his generation he was the only one. Tennis misses him.' However, as the white, straight, middle-class son of an architect from Leimen, Becker lacked the authority of a King or an Arthur Ashe. Yes, his parents had met in a displaced persons' camp after the war, but he was a child of privilege who could never embody his causes. Ivan Lendl dubbed Becker 'the limousine radical', and it was true. Becker had strong opinions but no struggle. Then he fell in love. In the autumn of 1991 Becker met Barbara Feltus, a model and aspiring actress, the daughter of an African-American serviceman and a white German woman. By that time Becker, at 23, had achieved all a tennis player could ask for: three Wimbledon titles, one US and one Australian Open championship (a second Australian crown would come in 1996), two Davis Cup titles, a stint at number one. 'She was spontaneous, very lively,' Boris says of Barbara. 'I was moody, didn't know whether I should continue playing tennis, and she brought sunshine into my life. She was the complete opposite of how I was.' At a New Year's Eve party in Australia, Becker decided to go public with the romance. Just before he and Barbara ventured downstairs and danced together for all to see, he stood in a hotel room and told her, 'Tomorrow your life will be completely different - for the rest of your life.' Barbara had no idea how bad it could be. Death threats poured in. People shouted at tournaments that Barbara was a gold-digger, a 'black witch'. Becker, Germany's most famous man, adored for his so-called Germanic blond looks and furious game, had betrayed something deep. One headline wailed, 'Why, Boris? Why not one of us?' Neither Boris nor Barbara flinched. Fifteen months later he secreted a diamond ring in her whisky sour and proposed. They shocked Germans by posing nude for a photo on the cover of the weekly magazine Stern. Becker threatened to leave Germany if the racist rants didn't stop. After they married in 1993 and Noah was born and their devotion showed no sign of abating, a sea change occurred. By the mid-90s, says Becker, he and Barbara were 'a symbol of the new Germany'. When he spoke out, he had all the authority he could handle. 'I wasn't just talking about it; I lived it,' he says. 'I've felt racism because of her, because of Noah. Because they look a little different, they get treated differently, so it's credible if I talk about it now.' 'He was a kind of social hero,' says Paul Sahner, a longtime friend of Becker's and a writer for Bunte magazine. 'They were a glamour couple. Many people lived their dreams through Boris and Barbara.' So much so that, by 1997, when Becker curtailed his tournament play and their marriage started crumbling, Boris and Barbara still put on a perfect face. 'We almost had no choice but to play along,' says Becker, 'and it put more pressure on the relationship than already existed. That's probably why we're divorced today. We started to play roles to please everyone.' The marriage ended with a spectacular crash. On 9 November 2000, the 62nd anniversary of Kristallnacht, Becker marched with 200,000 others through the streets of Berlin to protest against Germany's rising tide of racist violence. He was the very picture of a serious man. Only one month later, he was an object of ridicule around the world. Becker had no one to blame but himself. Since the previous March, he had been quietly pressed by a London-based Russian waitress-model for up to $5m to support a daughter she claimed was his. Boris and Barbara agree this didn't cause their split, but it didn't help that Barbara first learned of the baby when she took a call at home last August from the Russian woman herself. On 23 November, Becker told his wife he wanted a separation, touching off a hurricane of marital nastiness. He says divorce was the furthest thing from his mind, but less than a week later Barbara flew to Miami with their sons, and on 8 December she applied in Dade County Circuit Court for financial protection, child support and use of the $3m Fisher Island condominium - in effect sidestepping a prenuptial agreement that entitled her to a single $2.5m payoff. Charges and countercharges flew. Out spilled one revelation after another. In early December, the press linked Becker with a German rap star named Sabrina Setlur after they were seen checking into the same Black Forest hotel at which Boris and Barbara had honeymooned in 1993. On 12 January, the Russian waitress-model, Angela Ermakova, went public, claiming that she and Becker had had sex in a broom cupboard at London's Nobu restaurant on the last night of June 1999. Becker called Ermakova's story 'false,' and - though he never elaborated - a flurry of reports appeared saying Becker planned to claim the two had engaged only in oral sex and that Ermakova had transferred his semen to her womb as part of a blackmail scheme. The tabloids pounced: 'Becker: Russian mafia tried to steal my sperm.' On 4 February, Becker publicly blamed his divorce on Barbara's friendship with a racy group of Munich women who dubbed themselves the Tits and Ass Club. By contrast, he told Der Spiegel, 'I took the job of father earnestly.' He also told a German newspaper that the love between him and Setlur was a 'little plant that must be fed'. (Becker and Setlur have since broken up.) On 7 February DNA tests confirmed his paternity, and Becker agreed to payments that will eventually total about $1.5m. 'I take responsibility,' he said in a statement to the press. 'Children are the most innocent people in our world.' 'If Boris had more than just charm and balls,' says Samuel I Burstyn, Barbara's divorce lawyer, 'he'd really be dangerous.' It ended, as these things will, in a tawdry mess - and one in which Becker views himself as the greater victim. He has been deceitful but feels deceived. He admits affairs but insists that marriage should be bigger than infidelity, that it was his and Barbara's diverging priorities that led to the split. 'People kissed her ass, and she started to enjoy it,' Becker says. 'We didn't have enough time for us. There was too much party. She wanted to become a singer, and I'd say, \"We shouldn't forget family.\" I'm not saying I was the best husband. I spent too much time away. But I was trying to make her aware that it's only the four of us. We're the boat, and we shouldn't rock the boat.' Barbara declined to be interviewed, but Burstyn says Boris's peccadillos alone set the boat rocking, and his rendezvous with Setlur at the honeymoon hotel convinced Barbara that the marriage was over. Boris, meanwhile, is sure Barbara had plotted to leave him for months. 'On the other hand,' he says, 'I'm proud she is a smart lady and knows exactly what she's doing. I have more respect for her now than I had before.' This sounds odd, but then Becker also dined daily with his wife and kids during the legal manoeuvrings. On 4 January he took the stand in a pre-trial hearing and answered two hours of questions while Burstyn made him look like a cad for a live TV audience in Germany. That night, Becker went back to Fisher Island and, he says, told Barbara, '[If we go to trial], it's your turn. And not for two hours: my lawyer's going to grill you for six.' Becker says she agreed to settle the case then, but Burstyn insists that two days before Becker was to give a deposition about his financial affairs, he called Burstyn at home and surrendered. Either way, Becker lost. The boys would live with Barbara, she and Boris would share custody, and Barbara would get a package widely reported to be worth $14.4m. Becker's consolation prize: on 18 January, Noah's seventh birthday, he spent the night at the Fisher Island condo for the first time since November, using a guest bedroom - an informal arrangement that will continue indefinitely. 'We live during the day like a family,' Becker says. 'Then I sleep in my room, and she sleeps in hers. It's very, very weird.' There are times, he says, when he and Barbara ask each other, 'What did we do?' Sometimes, he adds, they talk about getting back together, maybe even getting married again. 'I love her,' Becker says, 'but that was a big hurt in December. I have made a lot of mistakes, some I will regret for the rest of my life, but I would never do anything to purposely hurt my family. This woman had my heart. For her to do something like she did showed a side of her I didn't know. I'm scared. I'm basically scared of the woman.' Seven mirrors stand waiting on the stage. Becker takes his position before them, and the photographer starts snapping, belting out commands to the assistants who stand behind each mirror, adjusting. 'Number 4, you're making him look like a giant,' the photographer says. 'I am a giant,' Becker says, and whether he is being serious is unclear. As a player, he assumed regal prerogatives, took massages during bathroom breaks, prepared to receive serve only when he was good and ready. Of Wimbledon, he'd say, 'This is where I live', and before each match that's how he would act. 'The attendants used to come in and say, \"Mr Becker, five minutes\",' says Nick Bollettieri, who coached him in '94 and '95. 'He was in his jogging clothes, didn't pay attention. \"Mr Becker, four minutes.\" He would take the clothes off, fold them piece by piece. Go into the bathroom. \"Mr Becker, it's time.\" He would come out, slowly put on his tennis clothes. \"Mr Becker, it's time.\" But he wouldn't pay attention, and no referee said a word. They were scared shitless.' There are signs - a telltale use of the third person, a low-grade paranoia - that Becker's sense of his own importance has not diminished with the end of his career. If anything, two months on the front page of German newspapers have convinced him that he still takes up much space in the public imagination, his travails a delight for the masses. 'Finally: a little payback,' he says. 'Becker was the winner for so long. The best in tennis with the best-looking wife, beautiful kids, money. He's smart - whatever he touches is gold! In Germany they thought they had me in a box, and they can't cope with the fact that I'm 33, single, so they stir it up. Because I am so much in that country.' Even now, Boris Becker is the biggest name in Germany, eclipsing singers and chancellors. 'I don't know if a Michael Jordan comparison is strong enough,' says AOL-Germany marketing director Phillipp Schindler. 'Boris's sympathy levels are outstanding. He is the German superstar.' This can carry Becker far, obviously, and he will need it. By the end of his playing days, the youthful clarity that so pleased Ion Tiriac had been muddied. Becker didn't train as hard, he bullied opponents with his stature. 'I can describe Boris very quickly,' says Bollettieri. 'He knew a lot; what he didn't know, he thought he knew; and he would intimidate people into thinking that he knew it.' Becker has done well with three Mercedes dealerships and by lending his name to AOL, DaimlerChrysler, Volkl rackets and the RTL television network. But his stint as Germany's Davis Cup manager ended in failure in 1999, largely because he couldn't get along with one of the country's leading players, Nicolas Kiefer. That same year Becker was the front man for a $300m bid by the London-based agency Prisma to market the ATP Tour, but Prisma lost out because Becker demanded too much control. His short stint advising Australian star Mark Philippoussis at last year's Wimbledon fizzled out too. And just as his marriage started to crumble, Becker's long-term business manager and close friend, Axel Meyer-Wolden, died of cancer in 1997. Two years later Becker's father, Karl-Heinz, died. Boris, a star since the age of 16, had never indulged in the usual experimentation nor made the usual mistakes a boy makes in his late teens. Few were surprised, therefore, when, at 32, he began indulging himself as never before. His final day as a player, at Wimbledon in 1999, stands like a doorway between his glorious past and his soiled present. Becker lost in straight sets in the fourth round to Pat Rafter. Becker knew it was over for him. He had liked sitting in the changing-room during the rain delays that day, talking to older players who were back for seniors matches, but he felt removed from the whole scene, as if watching someone else complete his career. After losing, he met with the press and began drinking. Barbara was seven months pregnant with Elias. She wanted to spend the night alone with Boris, but he had other ideas. 'This is the night,' Becker recalls. 'I'm officially out, no way back, and I'm celebrating with my buddies, and we drink and drink. I have a big argument with Barbara, and she goes crazy and I go crazy, and I say, \"This is a very important day of my life. On this night, I don't want to fight; it's not allowed.\" But she went on and I went on, and I drank more. I was crazy.' He ended up at Nobu with friends, and there was Ermakova, the colossal blunder he didn't make until the last day of his career. He was still buzzing with the thrill of his final match, still wanting a piece of the action. Then he was in a cupboard; standing outside himself for the second time that day, he watched someone called Boris Becker drunkenly sire a daughter. 'I had no idea what I was doing,' he says. 'It wasn't an affair. It was just poom-bah-boom!' Ever since, Becker has tried to keep busy. He has cooked with chef Paul Bocuse in a TV special, hung out with designer Karl Lagerfeld in another. He owns half of Volkl. He is doing plenty of interviews. Still, for a man so apt to see all kinds of signals of his own greatness, his world is sometimes dominated by a frivolousness that is almost painful to see. One night in March, Becker went to a South Beach club called Bed, where dinner is served to customers as they loll about on giant beds. In walked Sean (Puffy) Combs, fresh from New York City and his recent acquittal on gun charges. Becker and Combs compared notes on their rides through the celebrity courtroom circus. 'I was in bed with Puffy, actually - and a beautiful Indian girl and a Hungarian girl,' Becker says. 'They bring us a meal, the food, appetisers, fruit, champagne. Continental cuisine.' As his friend Sahner sees it, 'Until 1999, Boris didn't have much of a fun life. Now he must find his way. If he continues to do what he has done for the past two years, it will be very dangerous for him and his image.' 'He looks lost,' says Haas. 'He would like to have a family, but on the other hand he feels good about being free so he can do what he wants. It's tough. When you're on tour for as long as he was, as successful as he was, as committed, you miss out on some things. Now he's really got nothing.' Yet, there are flashes. Becker is a member of the Laureus World Sports Academy, a foundation devoted to achieving social change through sport, and when he heard about its support of the US-based Midnight Basketball programme, he insisted on seeing it in action. He went to Richmond, Virginia, attended a workshop, gave a pep talk, borrowed some socks and sneakers and played before an audience of just 100 people. A month earlier, he had spent two days working in a Berlin programme for juvenile delinquents. He still wants to make a difference. The same objectivity that allowed Boris to admire Barbara even as she took him apart also enables him to see that his career created a creature of fame named Boris Becker. He can't decide if his life is a Wagnerian opera or a Beckett farce, so he takes himself too seriously and pokes fun at himself, often at the same time. He recently finished shooting a film in Germany, playing himself. 'Yeah, myself,' Becker says. 'Whatever Boris I'm supposed to be that day.' He still wants to play. He has scheduled a series of seniors events for the next few months, and there's persistent talk about a showcase match against John McEnroe after the women's final at this year's US Open. Most of all, Becker wants one more taste of Wimbledon, wants to play doubles in the main draw - not this summer but next, when his game is in better shape. Becker knows he will never do anything as well as he played tennis. He has found only one thing that even brings him close. 'That Sunday afternoon: you're in the Wimbledon final, it's the third set, and you're about to win,' Becker says. 'Those 20 minutes and then that night and the next couple of weeks are just heaven. This is something I miss. Because even with a great business deal, it's not the same sensation. Tennis is an art form. I feel as if I'm performing on a stage in front of millions of people, and I was sometimes able to fascinate them for two weeks. This culminates with a Sunday final, match point, and then all the celebrations. It's like a long foreplay that ends with a huge orgasm. That's what it is.' He does not laugh. Tennis is sex and sex is tennis; never mind that the last time he mixed the two, he ended up in a broom cupboard. Without one, life is dull for him. Without both, life is death. Becker would like to fall in love again. For now, though, he's thinking about the green grass of England, and giving the world one more big bang."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
