I had a little belief that England would fight to the death; the Ashes were important. I wanted to believe that Hussain could inspire just as Caddick had done. Instead, I got disappointment and a day off. As England's inspiration on the second day, Caddick was magnificent, bowling with control, aggression and purpose. During Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning he emanated lethargy, bowled entirely the wrong length and allowed the Australian batsmen to settle on the back foot and wait for width, whereupon Matthew Hayden and Damien Martyn in particular were punishing. He did fire up a little when Steve Waugh duckfooted to the crease and eventually got him with a delivery that Hayden had earlier been belting to the boundary. But there's not much use waiting until the No6 takes guard to get seriously involved. Caddick must be bloody irritating to his captain. How about giving Langer and his left-handed mate something to think about? By the time Caddick had removed Waugh the match was beyond recovery. The target was always out of England's reach, history had to be created, victory was never in the mix. But the astonishing manner of their demise was just as unlikely an outcome. Now, what about Matthew Hoggard? Through the southern winter I had some late nights in front of the box watching England's battles with India and Sri Lanka. I enjoyed Hoggard's adherence to the golden rule, one which I learned as a young professional in Lancashire in the late 70s - \"length and line, and you'll do fine\". Wonderful, basic stuff that doesn't often bring dramatic wicket hauls but certainly has long-term effect and is useful support when Caddick or Gough or Jones are firing the bullets. The plane journey has not been kind to Hoggard. While crossing the equator a lobotomy has been performed, robbing him of all bowling common sense and knowledge. He is much better than we have seen in Brisbane and will be needed in Perth where swing into the Fremantle breeze often proves fruitful. If the bowlers have produced precious little pressure then the batting succumbed to the opposite. As much as England's bowlers have allowed easy runs to be scored then the Australians should be noted as the exemplar. Their adherence to a fuller length with the occasional but well- directed short ball came straight from the prescribed text. McGrath could find a career in neurosurgery if taking wickets gets boring. Warne may thrive with dual degrees in psychology and the scalpel of a cardiac surgeon. They were precise, they gave away few freebies and nearly every ball had purpose and intent. Waugh could set seven or eight men on the off-side because his bowlers could direct their offerings appropriately. Hussain had a fixation with seven on the off and no fine leg; his men rarely did those field placements justice. This will need a major rethink. The plan and the execution are seriously flawed. The best bowler of the first innings, Jason Gillespie, only bowled six overs. He and McGrath removed the dangerous openers within the first two overs and there was a sense that England would stagger to a loss around tea on Monday. Maybe they could earn some respectability with an honourable loss, perhaps they could perform a miracle and see off the Aussies for a draw. What happened? 170 balls later Steve Waugh's Indians were dancing around the totem, that's what happened. This defeat, after a disastrous start (do not cite the decision to send Australia in as the reason) and a promising recovery, will be soul-destroying. There is no coming back from the nature of this whipping. Damaged, demoralised and defeated, they can only look forward to continued waves of attack. Flogged and a long way from home, England are gone. They cannot rely on their openers to repeatedly get big starts that will protect the middle men from a newish ball. Even when that happens the menace of Warne looms large. These teams are certainly in a different class. They may not even be at the same school. I've tried to be fair, I've tried to be objective but the Poms are letting me down big time. Who can hold boast a pass mark? Butcher? Crawley, Trescothick? Passes at best. The fight for the dunce's cap would be a better spectacle than the cricket. On the bright side there is only four Tests and three million one dayers to go - plenty of time and room for improvement I guess."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
