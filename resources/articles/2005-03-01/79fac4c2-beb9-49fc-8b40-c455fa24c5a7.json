Research commissioned by the organisation's travel service found one in five UK holidaymakers fails to travel with a valid E111 form, meaning they cannot claim free healthcare in the EU. Many incorrectly believe travel insurance acts as a substitute for the form, and that it will be sufficient to receive the treatment they may need, which is not the case. Everyone needs both. Those without a form have to pay for their treatment upfront, then try to claim it back later. Last year almost half of those receiving medical treatment in the EU did not have a valid E111. 'Millions of holidaymakers are leaving themselves vulnerable to unnecessary headaches in recovering medical costs they are entitled to as a UK resident,' said Hugh Stacey, head of travel services. 'As Easter is a peak time for travel, we are urging anyone planning to holiday within the EU to ensure a valid E111 is on their essential checklist.' Forms obtained before the 19 August 2004 are no longer valid, a fact 69 per cent of those questioned were not aware of, so travellers should ensure they have one of the new versions. These will be valid until the end of this year. From January 2006, all EU countries will adopt the European Health Insurance Card, which will automatically be sent to residents with a valid E111. Family members must now have their own individual form. Forms are available from all branches of the Post Office (www.postoffice.co.uk/travelinsurance.)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
