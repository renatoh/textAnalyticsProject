In Who Are You Calling Fat? (BBC Two) it is the turn of nine people living with obesity to be brought together under one Oxfordshire roof for a month to examine attitudes to fatness. At one end of the spectrum is gastric-banded 57-year-old Del, who was previously 25st, and had many health issues, together with side-effects from the drug he takes to control them. At the other end of the spectrum is Victoria, a fat-positive advocate and activist who calls bariatric surgery \u201cstomach amputation\u201d and considers \u201coverweight\u201d and \u201cobese\u201d to be offensive terms that carry unnecessary moral implications by suggesting there is a weight you \u201cshould\u201d be. The rest fall between them, with civil servant Babs at the most conflicted midpoint: she hates \u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cthe amount of adipose tissue she carries\u201d and herself for having accumulated it. But after a life of futile dieting and covering up on the beach, she wishes she could find a way for her size not to matter to her \u2013 or at least not to dominate her life. All nine seem mentally robust enough to preclude the accusations of exploitation commonly made against this kind of thing \u2013 your mileage may vary, of course. They articulate their own life experiences and their responses to the various positions held by those in the house. Victoria is the primary catalyst for discussions, reappraisals and/or retrenchments among the group. Watching 25-year-old Jack, who has overhauled his lifestyle since being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, swimming in the outdoor pool she notes that society distinguishes between \u201cgood fatties, who work out, performing to show that they\u2019re worthy\u201d while \u201cbad fatties eat pizza\u201d. She is \u201can intuitive eater\u201d who believes that when nothing is forbidden, the craving for the (socioculturally) sinful goes away. Jack \u201cthinks it\u2019s all a load of bollocks, to be honest\u201d and carries on swimming, weight-training and running. He also invites a Diabetes UK volunteer, Colin, who lost his leg and suffered in various other ways from complications of the disease, to talk about the impact of his obesity (Colin and Jack have no problem with the word). Victoria, Miranda and David cluster in a room afterwards, seeking solace in their shared outrage at his use of shaming and fatphobic language. Others, including Jed, decide to head to the doctor for the first time in years. They disagree with Victoria that \u201cthe science is bogus\u201d and do not find the same comfort Miranda does in her assertion that \u201cskinny people can be unhealthy too\u201d. There is the emotional set piece mandated by all reality documentaries \u2013 here, a blindfolded Victoria, Courtney and eventually Babs stripping down in a busy high street and inviting people to write supportive messages on their skin \u2013 but the real substance lies in the rest. Watching Victoria at work is to be visited by endless important questions. Where does truth give way to conspiracy theorising? Is the fat positivity movement a necessary corrective to fat people\u2019s unquestionable marginalisation, or a damaging cult? Does the fact that medical advice is often too unthinkingly mixed with prejudice and acceptance of social norms actually mean that \u201chealth is a social construct\u201d and that there is no such thing as a healthy weight? Does self-love mean indulging every appetite to its fullest, heedless of others\u2019 opinions or likely consequences for yourself, or is there a better definition to be had? At one point, interspersed with shots of Colin struggling to move around the house and off sofas, the unseen interviewer asks Victoria if she wouldn\u2019t prefer to have her body than Colin\u2019s. She contends that: \u201cIf you are asking \u2018Would I prefer to have mobility?\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s an ableist question.\u201d Language itself buckles under the weight it has to bear. From there we are easily into broader questions, such as what evangelism offers the preacher and the preached to, when silent tolerance of others\u2019 beliefs becomes irresponsible, and what the limits can/are/should/should not be on matters of self-identification. Where do we end up if there are no such things as facts? Wholly liberated, or constrained by the uncertainty of the shifting sands about us? Discuss, long into the night. Altogether it is a programme that carries an unexpected heft, and carries it well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
