Parks, who came to Cardiff via Glasgow, landed three penalties in six minutes at the start of the second half to take the game away from Edinburgh and, although Tim Visser, the Dutch wing about to be co-opted into Scottish ranks, worked a clever try for Lee Jones, Parks responded with his second drop goal of the night. Just one kick went awry as Parks bagged Cardiff's first 18 points and, although Alex Cuthbert got the blood flowing by rounding off the belated ambition of the replacement prop Scott Andrew and the flanker Sam Warburton, Parks had the final say with the conversion to put Cardiff three points clear at the top of Pool Two. This was their six straight win over Edinburgh and, although the Scots are not out of the equation, they now have to beat Cardiff at Murrayfield next Friday night, something they have failed to do in two seasons of Celtic League rugby. Cardiff had most of their internationals back after the blip in form against Leinster and the Wales captain, Warburton, was rallying the troops with suggestions that, after the high of the World Cup, this could be the season when a Welsh region makes the Heineken final, something no side have managed since Cardiff were beaten by Toulouse in the first final 16 seasons ago. All three regions are undefeated, but it remains to be seen how the other two on Saturday survive the disruption that last week's money-spinning international against Australia clearly caused to Cardiff's training programmes. They made 11 changes from the team beaten 52-9 by Leinster last week and spent the first half bedding in. Edinburgh dominated both territory and chances but there was a hint of what was to come when Parks stole the lead with his first drop. However, if Cardiff were warming to the task, their rugby was anything but flowing and the half was petering out at 3-3 when he snaffled the lead for a second time. It was pretty poor fare for the few who braved the cold, redeemed only slightly by the way the Blues started the second half. Both props were involved, along with the lock Paul Tito and the flanker Michael Paterson, before Warburton took the ball into the shadow of the Edinburgh posts. The resultant scrum shambles led to a penalty and, although the move promised more, another three points suggested the page was turning. Parks added a third penalty four minutes later and another two minutes after that.
