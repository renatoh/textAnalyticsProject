Abdul Ajan is first in the queue for when the embassy opens the next morning, squeezed into a space that smells of urine and is littered with rubbish and stale bread. A frail looking 70-year-old, he clings to the closed gate with both hands, his shaking fingers tightly gripping the metal bars. Ajan has been waiting here for three days, but tomorrow, he says, he will be seen. \u201cInshallah!\u201d (\u201cGod willing.\u201d) He travelled several hours from Kapiza province by bus to get to Kabul for his appointment. \u201cI\u2019ve been sick for a while,\u201d he says, his half-blind eyes barely opening. \u201cI can hardly eat and I\u2019m in pain, but doctors weren\u2019t able to diagnose me here. That\u2019s why I want to go to Pakistan.\u201d The health system in Afghanistan is overworked and underfunded. The government spends 3% on the sector, equal roughly $5 (\u00a33.9) annually for each of its 37 million citizens. \u201cOur main problem is security. Most of the budget is spent on that,\u201d says Dr Wahid Mayar, spokesman for the public health ministry. It means that 70% of all healthcare in Afghanistan has to be paid for from people\u2019s own pockets. The country\u2019s health system has been progressing steadily, the UN says, with 3,135 facilities open last year, bringing healthcare to 87% of the population. But quality and equipment are often lacking and, like Abdul Ajan, many Afghans aren\u2019t diagnosed correctly and are left worried about their health and how problems can be treated. \u201cThere are many challenges,\u201d says Dr Ramin Faramarz, an orthopaedic surgeon in Kabul. \u201cIt already starts with electricity. When we have power cuts, we can\u2019t operate our machines and \u2013 even worse \u2013 in surgery, it can become dangerous.\u201d Last year, a total of 61,731 medical visas were issues by Pakistan\u2019s embassy and consulates in Afghanistan \u2013 roughly 5,000 applications are made daily and about 1,400 visas are issued daily. \u201cIt really comes down to making a diagnosis, and that doesn\u2019t always happen here, especially with kidney and heart diseases,\u201d says the Pakistani ambassador to Afghanistan, Zahid Nasrullah Khan. \u201cThere are about 100,000 Afghans seeking medical treatment in Pakistan annually.\u201d Precise numbers are hard to come by, he says, as many might travel to Pakistan for business, but incorporate hospital visits into their trips. Previously, visas for Pakistan weren\u2019t strictly enforced, but in recent years regulations \u2013 and borders \u2013 have tightened. For some, this can be a death sentence. \u201cMy neighbour \u2013 a good friend of my mother\u2019s \u2013 died of kidney complications because there wasn\u2019t enough time to get her a passport and process the visa,\u201d says Mahamt Said, who lives near the Pakistan border in Nangarhar. Resting in the shade of his fruit garden, he has just returned from Pakistan himself, where he had kidney surgery. He looks older than his 26 years. A plastic bag with medical documents rests on his leg. His passport is full of stamps. \u201cIt costs 10,000 afghanis [\u00a399] to apply for a passport and you have to travel to the capital for it,\u201d Said explains. \u201cThe visa is free, but the application process is long.\u201d His surgery, done in nearby Peshawar, cost him 50,000 rupees (\u00a3260), not including subsequent check-ups and travel costs. Outside the embassy in Kabul, located in a traffic-jammed, busy part of the capital, hundreds of men prepare for a cold night outside. Procedures for women are slightly different \u2013 with fewer lines and a separate room for the applicants. Most arrive in the early hours, or have their husbands queue for them. Shah Faizal, 25, says he\u2019s holding the spot for both him and his wife. A spinal cord injury has left him bound to a wheelchair and today he\u2019s relying on the assistance from other visa applicants. \u201cThey help me lie down on the floor to sleep at night,\u201d he says, adding that he only brought cardboard paper and a blanket for the night. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to sleep anyway. Some people are so sick, they should be in hospital and you can hear them suffer at night.\u201d Like him, many have come from rural areas, are illiterate and depend on nearby print shops to help them fill out and print visa applications for 100 afghanis. In the early morning, the hustling and bustling starts, as thousands of people try to squeeze into the courtyard of the embassy\u2019s visa section. \u201cThere\u2019s only one other way to get into Pakistan when you\u2019re sick and it\u2019s technically illegal,\u201d explains a border guard at Turkham, the busiest port of entry between the two countries. He didn\u2019t want to reveal his name. \u201cWe talk to our Pakistani colleagues on the other side, and when a person with a life-threatening emergency arrives here without documents, we look away and let them proceed anyway.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
