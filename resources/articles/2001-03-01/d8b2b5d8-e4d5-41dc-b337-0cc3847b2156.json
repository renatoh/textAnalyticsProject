These have been testing times at Fratton Park. Two wins in 20 games prior to Rix's appointment had left the spectre of relegation hanging over the South Coast club and led to the removal of the fans' favourite Steve Claridge from the managerial hot seat. The outspoken comments by Claridge regarding his now clearly untenable position at the club, and the unwelcome attention to Rix's past off-field misdemeanours, were not ideal preparation for the former Chelsea coach's first game in charge. However, the fraught Portsmouth press officer, who threatened to abandon the post-match press conference if there were questions about the manager's personal life, need not have worried. A hard-earned if not totally convincing win meant that the focus of proceedings was firmly fixed on football. After a scrappy opening period Portsmouth settled this match with two second-half strikes. The first came from Luke Nightingale, who rounded off a neat move after 56 minutes by planting an emphatic finish past Nikolaos Michopoulos from 12 yards. The 20-year-old's first league game settled the hosts' nerves and thereafter they dominated proceedings. Burnley, who have not won away from Turf Moor since October, were killed off 13 minutes later when Gordon Armstrong bodychecked the lively Steve Lovell in the box and Michael Panopoulos doubled the lead from the penalty spot. Afterwards a palpably relieved Rix urged against over-optimism. \"I've been looking forward to today all week and I'm delighted for the club. There's a long way to go but the win is good for confidence. \"We want to stay in the First Division; that is our priority this season. We've got another game on Wednesday and we need another positive result and performance.\" But the new manager was under no illusions about the size of the task he has been set by Portsmouth's Florida-based chairman Milan Mandaric. \"It's a big job in every sense,\" said Rix. \"The chairman wants to be in the Premiership as soon as possible. Portsmouth has been a sleeping giant for ages and everyone in football knows this is a football town.\" There was also relief at being back in football after he became one of the first victims of Claudio Ranieri's purge on English-speaking personnel at Stamford Bridge. \"I'm happy to be back in football. I've missed it too much. Saturday afternoons at home watching Sky Sports is not the same; you miss the adrenalin rush.\" Rix was guarded on his offer of a coaching role to Claridge. \"Don't ask me about Steve Claridge. I've given him a few days off to think about it and it's up to him. He phoned me on Friday night to wish me good luck, which was nice of him.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
