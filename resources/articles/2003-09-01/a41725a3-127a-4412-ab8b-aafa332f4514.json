Crutchley, who has died aged 96, oversaw not only a great expansion of university printing - and the move of the printing house from its cramped city-centre site to new factory buildings on the edge - but also the shift from hot-metal composition and letterpress printing to filmsetting and offset. In smoothing the way for change in a conservative industry, he used a technique he had first found effective as assistant printer for cajoling his boss, Walter Lewis, to move into better offices in the gothic-revival Pitt Building: Crutchley had realised that if he quietly used the phrase \"when we're in the Pitt Building\" often enough, it would eventually be accepted as a fait accompli. Adapted to circumstances, it was to work again and again. Crutchley was born in Bedford Park, London, the son of a civil servant. After Shrewsbury school and Trinity Hall, Cambridge - of which college he later became vice-master (1966-70) - he worked for a year as a journalist on the Yorkshire Post before being invited to Cambridge as assistant university printer in 1930. Walter Lewis, the man who took him on, was a master-printer of the old school, who was making the press one of the most highly regarded printing houses in the country - both for its design and its presswork - capable not only of mathematical setting of great elegance but also of undertaking fine editions for the Nonesuch Press. Since 1925, Lewis had been assisted by Stanley Morison, who was typographic adviser to both Cambridge and the Monotype Corporation; indeed, many of the typefaces Morison helped introduce for hot-metal monotype setting were tried out at Cambridge, including Eric Gill's Perpetua. In 1953, Crutchley asked Morison to write his account of the monotype programme, A Tally Of Types, which was beautifully printed as one of the Cambridge Christmas books, a handsome series given by the university printer to friends in the trade and the university. A generous practice, begun by Lewis and Morison, it ended with Crutchley's retirement. In 1940, Crutchley organised an exhibition of printing to celebrate the quincentenary of Gutenberg's pioneering work, concentrating on printing's contribution to the development of knowledge. It was put on at the Fitzwilliam museum in May, but was forced to close almost immediately when the risk of German bombing became too great. The catalogue, however, outlasted the event, and the theme was taken up in 1963 for the London exhibition Printing And The Mind Of Man. Lewis retired in 1946, and Crutchley took over, himself retiring in 1974. In those three decades, the university press finally outgrew the Pitt Building site, where the printing workshops were crowded cheek-by-jowl with the editorial offices, and authors were as likely to deal directly with the printer as with the secretary to the syndics, the governing body. The move to Shaftesbury Road was made in 1963. Crutchley's organisational ability and interest in people made him the ideal person to plan the new factory, supervise the change of location and oversee the enormous developments in printing technology and working practices. But his respect for learning and typographical tradition ensured that the university press's reputation for good design and high production standards was maintained. After his retirement, which was marked with a handsome book of tributes printed on handmade paper, Brooke wrote an autobiography, To Be A Printer (1980), adding to his memoirs of a working life which had begun with the 1968 Christmas Book, Two Men, about Lewis and Morison. Between 1984 and 1992, he contributed to every number of the book arts annual Matrix, with theoretical and historical studies of typography. He was made a CBE in 1954. He is survived by his wife Diana, whom he married in 1936, two sons and a daughter. \u00b7 Brooke Crutchley, printer, born July 31 1907; died August 31 2003"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
