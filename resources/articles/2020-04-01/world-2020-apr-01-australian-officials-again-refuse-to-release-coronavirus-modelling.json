Prof Paul Kelly, the deputy chief medical officer, told reporters on Monday he had asked his staff \u201cto organise a meeting later this week where the modelling and the epidemiology and the public health response will be unlocked, and people will be able to ask questions about that\u201d. But during a media conference in Canberra on Wednesday, Kelly sought to clarify his comments. \u201cI have been quoted as saying I would release the modelling,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI would like to clarify that we will discuss the modelling and look to make that transparent in coming days. \u201cWe really have our local epidemiology, which is very much open and we report on it every day at these briefings; it is on the website and so forth. That is really what is guiding most of our decision-making at the moment.\u201d Kelly made the latest comments as he confirmed Australia now had 4,860 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 20 deaths \u2013 a further death was reported on Wednesday afternoon. He said although there were more cases each day, the curve was flattening \u201cand rather than thinking about a peak we should be thinking about a long haul\u201d. Pressed on whether the release of modelling would give the public greater trust in the far-reaching decisions of the authorities, Kelly said transparency could be very important but modelling could be \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d and had to be presented in a way that was useful. \u201cThe other thing I would say about modelling \u2013 and modellers themselves would also say this \u2013 modelling is not necessarily the truth. It is a way of seeing the world and potentially pointing out how one can influence certain scenarios, but if we knew the truth and could see exactly what was going to happen in the next few months then we don\u2019t need to model. We would know the truth.\u201d The Australian Academy of Science has been leading the call for the release of the data and evidence underpinning government decisions in tackling the pandemic. The academy\u2019s president, Prof John Shine, argued last week that it was \u201ccritical that the public has confidence that governments are basing their decisions on the most up-to-date scientific advice and evidence\u201d. One of Kelly\u2019s colleagues, Dr Nick Coatsworth, indicated on Tuesday that the modelling showed \u201ca very large curve in cases for what we call the unmitigated scenario, where you don\u2019t do anything to stop it and just let it run through the community, and then you see the graph flattening\u201d. Coatsworth, who is also a deputy chief medical officer, said in the interview with Seven\u2019s Sunrise program: \u201cSo what Australians will see is very close to what the prime minister showed a couple of weeks ago, when he showed the graph and he introduced the concept of flattening the curve.\u201d The health minister, Greg Hunt, told reporters on Tuesday that \u201cthere will certainly be additional modelling provided\u201d. The information was currently being reviewed, Hunt said, \u201cbut every day we\u2019re providing all the information we have\u201d. Guardian Australia has contacted the health department to seek clarity on its plans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
