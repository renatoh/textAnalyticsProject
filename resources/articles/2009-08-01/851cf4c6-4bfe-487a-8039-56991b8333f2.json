The first mailshot offered an extra \u00a39,200 at 9.6% APR, compared with the 5.78% I am paying. I complained but received another mailshot offering an extra \u00a310,600 at 8.9%. This annoys me considerably, not least because Lloyds appears to be incapable of removing my name from the list of customers being mailed every couple of months. DJ, Shipley, West Yorkshire It annoyed me too. I am appalled banks are still pushing loans on customers and at higher rates of interest than they pay now. The marketing literature emphasised your monthly payments could stay the same by spreading the larger loan over a longer period. This would cost even more overall \u2013 and focusing on the monthly payment rather than the total cost is a tactic used by loan sharks. To tempt borrowers further, Lloyds has added a buy now/pay later option so there is nothing to pay for the first three months and you get a one-month repayment holiday. Lloyds doesn't see it that way. It says many customers want to borrow more during the term of a loan, sometimes using credit cards which are more expensive than loans, so it gives a few select customers the option of consolidating borrowings. The rates of interest are tailored to individual customers. Lloyds says your loan, taken out in 2006, was at one of the lowest interest rates it has offered and today's rates are higher because the economic outlook is different. Clearly you should retain your existing cheap loan. Your name has now been removed from Lloyds' mailing list and a note put on your file to ensure you receive no more marketing material, apart from the July mailing, which had already gone out. The bank has sent you \u00a375 in the hope of regaining your confidence after the telephone banking service and complaints handling team failed to act on your request for no more mailshots. \u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU and include a telephone number.
