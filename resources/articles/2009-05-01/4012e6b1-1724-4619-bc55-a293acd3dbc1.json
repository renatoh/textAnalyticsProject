He was born in Ethiopia and lived there on his parents' farm until the Italian invasion in 1935. He was then educated in Britain and served during the second world war in the 6th Gurkha Rifles in India and Burma, where he was seriously wounded. His key work began in 1956 when he was appointed UN Food and Agricultural Organisation livestock adviser in Ethiopia. Except for short periods in Kenya, Sudan and Syria, he devoted the rest of his life to Ethiopian agriculture. From 1980 until 2007, although living in Shropshire, he was a frequent visitor to the country of his birth. Dick was one of six children. Our father, Brigadier Dan Sandford, had led the mission that visited resistance fighters after the Italian occupation, pledging British help to Emperor Haile Selassie to push out Mussolini. He was then appointed as the emperor's principal military adviser. In 1946 our mother, Chris, founded Sandford school, now one of the best schools in Ethiopia. Dick, in turn, supported his Ethiopian colleagues in four areas: together, they mapped out the livestock sector (it has the largest population in Africa); they secured public sector investment in the dairy and pastoral divisions; they managed those investments; and they persuaded the Derg regime, which ruled between 1974 and 1991, to involve non-government organisations in the development of agriculture, which continued under the subsequent government. After \"retiring\" to Shropshire, Dick helped various NGOs, in particular Farm-Africa and Sunarma, to carry out their strategies in Ethiopia. He was generous in his help for colleagues. Long before \"participation\" became fashionable, he stressed the importance of understanding farmers' views. His capacity for speaking local languages, principally Amharic and Oromiffa, enabled him to communicate directly with farmers. His many nephews and nieces marvelled at his ability to listen to people's ideas with interest, but finally to say, \"I have just one question to ask\", and go straight to the heart of the matter. We all, often ruefully, remember his huge energy, devoted in his spare time to horses and walking impossibly fast over Ethiopia's mountains. He is survived by his wife, Anne, their son, three daughters and nine grandchildren."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
