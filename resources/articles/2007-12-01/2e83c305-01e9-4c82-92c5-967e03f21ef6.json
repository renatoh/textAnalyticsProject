But Julie McGinley - the mother of two serving a life sentence for the murder of her husband Gerry seven years ago - is to begin a fresh campaign to have her conviction overturned. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is supporting her legal team's bid to have her case re-examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. She has also received the backing of all the religious chaplains serving prisoners in Maghaberry jail and Hydebank Wood young offenders centre. In addition, the Belfast Rape Crisis Centre has urged her to be freed, claiming that she was married to a violent sexual aggressor and was easily manipulated and terrified by men around her. The centre has described the case as a clear-cut miscarriage of justice. The HRC's director Monica McWilliams has also criticised the media's treatment of her as a prisoner and claimed the coverage has damaged her children's right to privacy. The Observer has learnt that the man also convicted of Gerry's murder, Michael Monaghan, has informed her supporters that he intends to tell any new court case that Julie was not in the bedroom where her husband died in August 2000. Monaghan claims he did not intend to kill Gerry in what was a violent brawl between the two men. Campaigners for Julie's freedom have tried to contact a third man connected to the case, PJ McPadden, who she says was in the family house on the night of the fatal assault. There is no suggestion McPadden took part in the beating but according to Julie's supporters he can verify that she was guarding her children in another room while her husband was attacked. McPadden is currently living across the border in Sligo and Julie's supporters are hoping to meet with him later this week. Julie's life over the last two decades has been marred by tragedy, violence and manipulation. She was badly injured in the IRA bomb at the Enniskillen war memorial on Remembrance Sunday 1987. Seven years later she met and married Gerry, a convicted rapist. In October 1997 Gerry attempted suicide. Following that, Julie said her husband went into a vortex of deep depression punctuated by violence against her and a new obsession with pornography. He also coerced his wife into group sex with other men. From her prison cell Julie explains why she acquiesced to her husband's sexual demands. She said: 'To escape his temper and abuse, I had to do whatever he wanted. He had also threatened me regarding the children, and referred to the fact that they were two girls and since I was no use to him it was a good thing two more were coming along.' By 2000, Julie had developed a relationship with one of Gerry's acquaintances, Michael Monaghan. Gerry became obsessed with the idea that his wife should have sex with Monaghan at their home. On 12 August 2000, Gerry arranged that his wife meet Monaghan and McPadden at the Fort Lodge hotel in Co Fermanagh. It was a night fuelled by drink and the threat of violence from her husband. It culminated with Gerry attacking McPadden in his bedroom. Monaghan says he spotted a baseball bat beside the bed and hit Gerry on the head to stop him attacking McPadden. The PSNI and the prosecution at her original trial alleged that Julie had been part of a conspiracy with Monaghan to return to the marital home with Gerry and kill him. Both she and Monaghan insist she was not present in the bedroom when the fatal blow was struck. Nor, they both say, was anything planned. Julie admits that, out of fear for what would happen to her children, she colluded in a cover-up at the house and knew that Monaghan had taken her husband's body away. Despite there being no forensic evidence to link her to the killing, the jury and judge at her trial refused to believe her. She was sentenced to 15 years for murder. Had Julie been convicted of the crime she admits, assisting an offence, she would now be reunited with her daughters, Shannon and Karley, having already served her sentence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
