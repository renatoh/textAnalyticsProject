Suzanne was commended for her articles on attitudes to Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky in the wake of the #MeToo movement; why she was wrong to refuse to wear a poppy for remembrance; and why she did not take part in the march for a People\u2019s Vote. Run by the Orwell Foundation, the Orwell prize is awarded to the best commentary or reporting which comes closest to achieving writer George Orwell\u2019s ambition to \u201cmake political writing into an art.\u201d Judges commented: \u201cThe journalism that has won these two prizes represents the best of the Orwell tradition, incisive, relevant and human. It also represents the two sides of his journalism: there is Suzanne Moore\u2019s stubborn and brave commentary, and Steve Bloomfield\u2019s forensic research and reporting.\u201d More details about the awards can be found here."}, "isHosted": false}}}
