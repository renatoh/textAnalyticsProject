The Tory leadership hopeful is having a miserable week, starting with getting on the wrong side of her former breakfast TV colleague Lorraine Kelly. Now the mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, has revoked the Tatton MP\u2019s \u201cscouse privileges\u201d. If you are a Liverpudlian wondering how to get your hands on your own scouse privilege card, like the mock-up Anderson tweeted (with a red \u201cREVOKED\u201d stamp on it), don\u2019t bother \u2013 they don\u2019t exist. However, Anderson says, behind the stunt is a serious point about McVey\u2019s integrity: \u201cShe tries to portray herself as somebody who has equality at heart. But the reality is completely at odds with what she\u2019s done.\u201d Anderson says he is \u201csick and tired\u201d of McVey trying to portray herself as someone who understands working-class issues and poverty. \u201cHere is a woman using the brand of Liverpool to claim she is fair; that she has a knowledge of what it\u2019s like to be working class.\u201d Anderson says cuts to the city\u2019s budget have led to an increase in demand for food banks, which McVey has defended in the past. \u201cFor somebody who says food banks are a good thing because it shows a \u2018Big Society mentality\u2019 \u2013 well, what I think it shows is a broken society,\u201d he says. \u201cScousers have principles. They care for one another, they stand up for one another, they protect one another \u2026 Anyone who doesn\u2019t do that, in my view, is not a true scouser.\u201d So who would be Anderson\u2019s pick for Tory leader? Unsurprisingly, he says he has just as much contempt for the other candidates, none of whom, he says, have the integrity to solve the country\u2019s problems. \u201cThere is not one of them I would vote for. I would simply, if I had an opportunity to vote, spoil my ballot paper.\u201d But the worst option for him would be Boris Johnson, who once said the chances of him becoming prime minister were \u201cabout as good as the chances of finding Elvis on Mars\u201d. Anderson suggests an alternative: \u201cI\u2019d rather exhume Elvis Presley and put him as prime minister.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
