Did they play any word-association games? Did eager employees sit around a giant table, shouting out words synonymous with \"pad\", while a colleague scrawled \"note\", \"knee\", \"launch\", and \"to tread very lightly\" on a white board? And were there no women there? Did no one raise their hand with a weary grimace and say, \"You know what, guys, this is kinda obvious, but this word has other associations for me . . . Namely blood. Menstrual blood. Oh, and cramps. Also, painkillers. And sometimes shame. Don't forget the shame.\" Who knows? Perhaps the association of the word \"pad\" with \"sanitary protection\" just never came up. But as soon as the name was announced \u2013 and Steve Jobs described the product as \"so much more intimate than a laptop\" \u2013 the jokes began. And quickly became an avalanche. Within hours, the term \"iTampon\" was trending on Twitter, and these quips were circulating: \"Will women send their husbands to the Apple store to buy iPads?\"; \"If I order this, will my boyfriend and I have to worry if it comes late?\"; \"Meh. I'll wait until they come out with the iMoonCup\". Mock ads were created, including one featuring a sanitary towel with the Apple logo and slogan, \"Like a tampon. Only more expensive.\" And a 2006 clip (above) from the US sketch show, MadTV, featuring a product much like an iPod \u2013 but considerably more absorbent \u2013 went viral. It turned out that those sketch writers had had the idea for an \"iPad\" a full four years ago. Some have suggested that these jokes are a disaster for Apple; others have pointed out the enormous success of the Nintendo Wii \u2013 another product with a questionable name. And still others have implied that the geniuses behind the brand had all this free publicity in mind when they named the product. Are they really that clever? Or did they just go with the flow?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
