There can be contrived, false outpourings of emotion. Similarly perspective regarding the various, significant ills of the world is routinely lost amid focus of what happens at a football ground. A strong counterpoint to such matters is the coming together of football, and sport, when tragedy occurs. The sense of shock surrounding events at the end of yesterday's Scottish League Cup final between Celtic and Kilmarnock has developed into global, heartfelt sentiment towards Liam Kelly. The Kilmarnock midfielder should today still be celebrating the finest achievement of his career. The 22-year-old was an integral part of the team which secured the League Cup for the first time in Kilmarnock's 143-year history. Instead fate has issued Kelly and his family the cruellest of hands in front of his very eyes. The player's 59-year-old father, Jack, suffered a heart attack right on full-time at Hampden Park and his death at a Glasgow hospital was confirmed hours later. If Kelly, a fine young player, ever had aspirations of receiving a message of support from Sepp Blatter, he would have wanted it in virtually any other circumstance than it arrived on Monday afternoon. Fifa's president said: \"Tragic news about Liam Kelly's father passing away after Kilmarnock's cup final win. My deepest sympathies to Liam and his family.\" It is, in fact, almost impossible to quantify the size of the psychological challenge Kelly will now face when he eventually contemplates stepping back on to a football pitch. It was clear from the immediate aftermath of the game, even to an untrained eye, that something was amiss in the Kilmarnock camp. Exactly what remained unclear only briefly. Kelly did not collect a winners' medal or lift the trophy with his team-mates. Kilmarnock's manager, Kenny Shiels, also shunned the presentation to monitor the scale of the pitchside medical treatment being administered to Kelly Sr. Kilmarnock's players went ahead with an open-top bus parade through the town on Sunday evening, with many of them made aware of Jack Kelly's death during that tour. The squad's celebrations thereafter were muted, although many of Kilmarnock's supporters would not have been aware until the morning of the tragedy that had befallen a popular member of their team. As Kilmarnock's own website states: \"All the big emotions, Cammy Bell's heroics, Garry Hay's and James Fowler's first medals after long and distinguished careers, Dieter van Tornhout's first goal for the club on his birthday, all are dwarfed when real life butts in.\" Celtic's manager, Neil Lennon, added: \"All of the management team, players and backroom staff wish to offer our thoughts and prayers to Liam Kelly's family. \"Myself and the entire team are shocked and saddened with this news and our heartfelt condolences go to Liam.\" Through no fault of anybody an historic moment for Scotland's oldest professional club will forever be tainted by a shocking turn of events. An old-fashioned cup upset, typified by strong spirit and a smart tactical approach, is rightly regarded as irrelevant against such a desperately sad backdrop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
