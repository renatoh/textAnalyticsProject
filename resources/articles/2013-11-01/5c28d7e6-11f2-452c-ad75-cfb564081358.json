Yesterday India sent a rocket to Mars. At the same time, as predicted here last week, the wildly unpopular deputy prime minister Nick Clegg moved to shore up his reputation by hiring spin doctor Emma Gilpin-Jacobs as director of communications. Rocket to Mars? That was easy. \u2022 We have been monitoring events in the Socialist Workers party, which now stands accused of botching inquiries into two rape allegations without involving the bourgeois police. There is much disquiet internally, with loyalists contending that the leadership has made a fair fist of it, and an opposition group calling for root and branch reform. Inevitably, the opposition group has now split in much the same fashion as Monty Python's Judean People's Front/People's Front of Judea. One lot seems inclined to compromise with the party establishment; the other sees no way back. Observers reckon about 200 will break away from the party completely at or before the party conference in London next month, re-massing under their own title, journal and/or website. Capitalism is safe for a while yet. \u2022 While machinations continue over alleged skulduggery in the selection of a Labour candidate for Falkirk, events move apace in Brent Central where, by dynamic rather than diktat, Labour appears to be heading for an all-minority shortlist. Nominated thus far by the unions or constituency parties are such as former ministers Dawn Butler and Parmjit Dhanda, Hackney councillor Patrick Vernon, Hilary Benn's special adviser Imran Ahmed, and veteran activist Kingsley Abrams. Also with their hats in the ring are councillor Zaffar Van Kalwala and local stalwart Sabina Khan. Nominations close on 10 November. Whoever wins will probably stride into the Commons. An age since anyone even mentioned the incumbent Lib Dems. \u2022 We referenced Harrow East yesterday, where Labour hopefuls fight a passionate fight, and referred to British-Somali contender Amina Ali, who received a \"well done and carry on\" sort of blessing from Mo Farah. Could this result in her becoming the first BritishSomali MP in Westminster, we asked. No, said Mark Hendrick, Labour MP for Preston, because that was me, in the year 2000. He did it without Mo, too. \u2022 With the BBC always in trouble in some shape or form, the air is thick with former execs popping up to praise, castigate or defend themselves. The latest, former deputy director general Mark Byford. Only one, still active, keeps his counsel. Urged the other day by a publisher to enter the fray, the reticent bigwig rationalised his vow of silence. \"As they say: 'When the bishop retires, get out of the diocese!'\" What sins he could recount, but he will not tell.. \u2022 Many hoped we would be liberated by 21st-century technology, but it's not working out that way. Last week we told how Facebook, having embraced beheading videos, balked at the title of In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play). Today the techno-philistine award goes to TripAdvisor, nominated by a tourist who sought to laud a visit to Cumbria. \"The Theatre by the Lake is one of the best theatres in England and in the most spectacular of settings. We saw an excellent production of She Stoops to Conquer, a fun play with a superb set and lighting \u2026 We were booked to see the studio production of 'Tis a Pity She's a \u2026 (TripAdvisor will not allow us to correctly name this play).\" 'Tis a pity it's so squeamish. \u2022 Tips for Simon Cowell from the Jewish Chronicle, if it is true, as reported, that he plans a Jewish wedding. It notes that his father was Jewish, as is his perhaps intended. The Chronicle endorses a rabbi in north-west London, recommends X Factor-ite Alexandra Burke as the wedding singer, for she \"sang at many a 'simchah' (Jewish party celebration) before winning The X Factor in 2008\". As to the main entertainment, \"having Jewish performers who are at home with their roots could mean Bob Dylan or Leonard Cohen kicking off the celebrations,\" advises the Chronicle. That said, \"Laughing Len's lugubrious demeanour may not exactly be ideal for getting the party going.\" Maybe riotous Bob should go first.

This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
