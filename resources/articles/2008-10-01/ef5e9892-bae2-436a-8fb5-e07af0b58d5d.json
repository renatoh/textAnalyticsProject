Wherever he worked he inspired fun, laughter and affection, from the Russian patient who taught him to Cossack dance around the consulting room, to the elderly lady who knitted him fingerless mittens. Our father was a GP in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and Tony and I both followed him into medicine. After Ampleforth college, North Yorkshire, Tony was accepted by Cambridge University to read engineering, but after army national service, including a posting to Paris -he became fluent in French and a francophile -he read medicine at Trinity College Dublin, graduating in 1965. In 1969, we both became members of the Royal College of Physicians. Tony entered general practice in Oxford, before moving to Shepherd's Bush, west London, and eventually East Anglia. The pressures of being a single-handed GP took their toll, however, and in 1982 he took a break for 18 months and opened a bookshop in Honiton, Devon, which stills bears his name - Fogarty Books. Tony loved the tranquility of the Norfolk Broads and converted his boat, Moonglow, to run silently on electric propulsion. He was a pioneer of the Go Electric scheme and worked to set up the Broads Green boat show, a showcase for eco-friendly boating. More recently, he was involved in building a prototype electric car. He never wanted to retire, and continued to work as a part-time locum around Norwich. He retained his love of maths and physics and studied engineering with the Open University. He leaves his second wife, Elizabeth, and their two teenage children, as well as the six adult children of his first marriage, six grandchildren, two sisters and myself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
