The Scottish Executive will spend about a quarter more on your education than will be spent on students in England and Wales. You won't have to pay up-front tuition fees . Some of you will be eligible for a non-repayable grant to help with living costs. And, for students on standard full-time first degree courses, you will have four years at university, compared with three years in other parts of the UK. Other attractions could include having the television chef Clarissa Dickson Wright as the rector of your university, if you go to Aberdeen, or sharing a lecture theatre at St Andrews with Prince William. The sharpest funding differences in the UK are shown in the unit of funding resource for each full-time equivalent student. Next year, the unit of resource for all expenditure (recurrent and non-recurrent) in cash terms will be \u00a35,360 for each student in England, \u00a35,138 in Wales, and \u00a36,744 in Scotland . Information for Northern Ireland was not available at the time of writing. The unit will rise by slightly over 5% in England and Scotland , but only 3.5% in Wales. Once you have taken inflation at 2.5% into account for next year, the Welsh increase is only a lit tle bit above the rate of inflation. In terms of the unit of recurrent funding alone, which gives a clearer picture of what is actually being spent on the education of each student, spending next year in Scotland will be around 2% above inflation, spending in England will be 0.4% above inflation, and spending in Wales will be around 0.4% below inflation - a real-terms cut, in other words. This in itself is a remarkable improvement on the past decade and more, which has seen consistent real-terms cuts in spending for each student in the UK. But why is spending per student more than a quarter higher in Scotland than in England or Wales? Why are the recurrent increases higher for Scotland than for England and Wales? It is not that Scotland has a proportionately lower number of students. In fact, 46% of young people in Scotland participated in higher education in 1997-98, compared with 32% in England and Wales, and 44% in Northern Ireland. The answer lies in post-devolution funding decisions, and in the historical differences in spending baselines in each country, which may have been accentuated by the application of the so-called Barnett formula. This formula was introduced in 1978 as a means of linking levels of change in funding in England to funding in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland. It is based on population levels. The accuracy of the formula, and the extent to which its application may have benefited non-English parts of the UK - particularly Scotland - is a matter of controversy. But whatever the reason, spending per student in Scotland is way ahead of England and Wales. What must be galling to students in England and Wales is the fact that, while the amount spent on them lags behind Scottish students, they - like students in Northern Ireland - are having to pay up-front tuition fees for full-time undergraduate courses. Recent student support measures from David Blunkett's Department for Education and Employment mean that in 2001-2 only half the undergraduates in England and Wales will be liable to pay fees. But that's still 50% more than in Scotland , where fees were abolished from autumn 2000. The fissures in the UK caused by Scottish students in England, Wales or Northern Ireland having to pay fees, and English, Welsh and North ern Ireland students in Scotland also having to pay fees - unlike EU students - underline the impact of devolution. Students north of Hadrian's Wall aren't getting away scot-free: they will have to pay a graduate endowment of \u00a32,000 once they are income-earners. But this is about a third less than tuition fees elsewhere in the UK over the three years of a typical first degree. Since it is contingent on income , the Scottish endowment will be easier to pay than the up-front lump-sum tuitionfee. And the burden on Scottish families while they are supporting studentsthrough higher education will be smaller. And what is more, from 2001-2 non-repayable cost of living bursaries, to a maximum of \u00a32,000 a year, will be available to young students from poor families in Scotland . And about 30,000 mature students entering higher education for the first time will benefit from discretionary bursaries. It's a matter of attitude, as much as anything. The Scottish Executive, in last year's report Scotland : The Learning Nation, said: \"The fear of debt is a possible disincentive to students from lower income families entering higher education. A key objective of our new scheme is therefore to reduce the amount of loan students need to take out over the period of their study.\" Because of this, the executive is prepared to find resources from elsewhere to compensate institutions for the loss of tuition fees and fund a limited reintroduction of maintenance grants. Some vice-chancellors in England have questioned whether the position in Scotland is sustainable. The Scottish Executive estimates that the cost of these changes for HE and FE will be about \u00a350m a year, 2% of the total budget for the Department of Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in 2001-2. It should be manageable - particularly since the additional cash funding for higher education in Scotland from grant and fees in 2001-2 will be \u00a353m (and \u00a324m in 2002-3 and \u00a327m in 2003-4). In the long run, the cost of the abolition of fees will be offset by the full projected income of \u00a316m a year from the graduate endowment scheme. Since the Scottish participation rate is near the government's 50% target, less extra funding will be needed than in England and Wales. With devolution, it is likely that levels of public spending will increasingly diverge. A Treasury report notes: \"Responsibility for United Kingdom fiscal policy, macroeconomic policy and public expenditure allocation across the United Kingdom will remain with the Treasury. As a result, the devolved administrations' budgets will continue to be determined within the framework of public expenditure control in the United Kingdom. However once overall public expenditure budgets have been determined, the devolved administrations will have freedom to make their own spending decisions on devolved programmes within the overall totals.\" While education and employment secretary David Blunkett adopts a policy in England of ameliorating the impact of the introduction of tuition fees and the end of the maintenance grant, views in other parts of the UK are changing. The Welsh Assembly's education and lifelong learning committee is conducting a review of higher education in Wales. The review asks: \"How can we ensure that no student is deterred from taking up or completing his/her studies due to financial hardship?\" This includes assessing whether students should contribute financially towards tuition. The results of the review will be available in the spring. Meanwhile the minister for education and lifelong learning in Wales, Jane Davidson, is setting up an independent enquiry into student hardship and funding in Wales, to tackle problems in the current system of student maintenance and support. The Northern Ireland Assembly's committee for higher and further education, training and employment has proposed a system similar to Scotland 's, with the abolition of up-front tuition fees , graduate contributions to tuition, and means-tested non-repayable cost of living bursaries. Although higher education minister Sean Farren has not gone along with abolishing tuition fees , it may be that the example of Scotland and developments in Wales will create sufficient pressure to make him change his mind. That could just leave England as a bastion of the Blunkett-inspired system of tuition fees and no maintenance grant. But with a general election in the offing, who knows what will happen? \u0095 Stephen Court is senior research officer at the Association of University Teachers"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
