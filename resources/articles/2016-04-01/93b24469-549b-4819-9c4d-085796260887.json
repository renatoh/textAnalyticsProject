The treasurer, Scott Morrison, will announce a levy to raise $120m over four years for Asic, the same amount of money that was cut by the former prime minister Tony Abbott in the 2014 budget. \u201cThis will strengthen it [Asic] further,\u201d the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, told Sky News on Wednesday. \u201cThe cost will be borne by the banks.\u201d The new measures will help give Asic a \u201csharper edge to tackle wrongdoing\u201d, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told 5AA Radio. But those pushing for a royal commission say the money does not go far enough. \u201c[The money is] effectively returning some of the resources that they stripped away,\u201d the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, told ABC Radio. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to do the job.\u201d Morrison is also expected to announce a new commissioner, who will be tasked with investigating banking misconduct, and a strengthening of the role of financial services ombudsman. Earlier this month Labor announced it would hold a royal commission into banking impropriety if it wins the upcoming federal election. Opinion polls released this week show that the proposal has broad support in the community. Turnbull insists the government\u2019s new measures for Asic are \u201cnot a response to anything that has happened recently\u201d. \u201cThis is an issue we\u2019ve been addressing methodically,\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus has been on getting action here.\u201d The prime minister on Tuesday faced unrest from his backbench over the need for stronger action against the banks. The Nationals senator John Williams, who has long called for a royal commission into banking behaviour, said the new measures are \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d. \u201cThe banks ... want to clean up their act as well. I think these are good measures that Scott Morrison will put in place,\u201d he told ABC Radio. He acknowledged that Asic had \u201clifted its game\u201d but did not rule out pushing for a royal commission in if banking scandals continue. \u201cIt may well be on the agenda in the years to come,\u201d Williams said. Labor will continue to push for a broad-ranging inquiry. \u201cThe truth of the matter is nothing less than a royal commission will be satisfactory,\u201d the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, told Channel Nine. \u201cThe banks don\u2019t want a royal commission and Mr Turnbull doesn\u2019t want a royal commission but there are tens and thousands of customers who have been ripped of. \u201cWe hoped things would get better but they haven\u2019t so I do believe that a royal commission with its wide-spread powers will get to the bottom of it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
