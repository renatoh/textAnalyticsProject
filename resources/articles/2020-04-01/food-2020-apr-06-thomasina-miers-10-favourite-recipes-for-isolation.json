The sudden shortages, the constant meal planning, the rationing of fresh ingredients and the eking out of every last scrap ... There\u2019s no doubt that these are good habits to get into, and that this period has the potential to make better cooks of us all. We might become more conscious about food waste, realise we don\u2019t need to eat meat as much as we thought we did, grow more creative with the ingredients we have available. Below are 10 recipes from my archive that I\u2019m revisiting most at the moment: nourishing, hearty family meals that give us the goodness we need as resourcefully as possible. If, like me, you suddenly find yourself at home with children, some of these make an excellent diversion for little hands and big appetites. The perfect rice salad (main picture) Apples, carrot, nuts, raisins, herbs, and the eponymous rice, a dish that\u2019s packed with both flavour and nutrition, making it a brilliant lunchtime filler for all the family. If you don\u2019t have the wild rice I suggest in the recipe, use whatever you have, such as basmati. Homemade baked beans Comforting, utterly delicious and cheap as chips! My children were fascinated by how to make baked beans from scratch and to see how the various ingredients add different levels of flavour. Leave out the meat for a veggie version, and the eggs and sour cream for vegans. Macaroni cheese with purple sprouting broccoli This macaroni cheese is a great way to make a bit of cheese go a long way and is spiked with broccoli, giving the whole family all the nutrition it needs to stay happy and well. Parsnip gratin (or any other root) with apple allioli If you are finding eggs hard to find in the shops try making this silky, indulgent and incredibly delicious Catalan-inspried allioli, using apples to bind the mayonnaise instead of the normal egg. Layer it over sliced parsnips with hints of garlic and toasted nuts for a magical, warming gratin. Caramelised red onion, black pepper and blue cheese tart Sweet soft wedges of red onions cooked in butter and balsamic vinegar popped into pastry with blue cheese, thyme and black pepper. Mexican chilli The rich, warming spices so loved in Mexico add delicious layers of flavour to this fun, family dish. The sweet onions, tomatoes and pulses make the small amount of meat go a long way adding extra bang for your buck in terms of key protein. Ricotta and courgette dumplings with speedy tomato sauce The tomato sauce can be made in minutes with tins from the cupboard, leaving you to focus on making the dumplings. Experiment with different greens and get young people involved. Spinach and feta pie The glorious flavours and textures at play here \u2013 buttery, crispy pastry filled with salty feta and sweet spinach \u2013 belie the simplicity of the recipe. It makes a killer of a lunch or dinner with remarkably little fuss. Celeriac steaks with brown butter and fried capers A brilliantly cheap but tasty supper. Serve with rice or bread or with some sausages on the side. Smoky roast veg with goat\u2019s cheese and toasted nuts These roasted roots are infinitely adaptable \u2013 swap vegetables in and out, try feta if you haven\u2019t got goat\u2019s cheese, and, while saba is hard to get hold of at the moment, I suggest reducing some balsamic vinegar to a syrupy glaze in its place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
