June Oh Seo is facing domestic violence-related charges after his 34-year-old girlfriend Hee Kyung Choi was found dead in an alleyway below his balcony in Chatswood, northern Sydney. In Campsie, also in Sydney, Qing Ming Song was charged with the attempted murder of his partner after he allegedly attacked her with a hammer and a carving knife in an attack police said left her \u201cunrecognisable\u201d. In western Sydney, a 30-year-old woman was found dead with a stab wound to her torso last month. In a statement, police said they arrested 26-year-old man in relation to the death and charged him with murder and with contravening an apprehended domestic violence order. And also last month, an 87 year-old man was killed with a hammer and a knife in his home in Liverpool, New South Wales. His son was later charged with murder. Moo Baulch, the chief executive of Domestic Violence NSW, said not much had changed since the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, addressed a Council of Australian Governments (Coag) summit on the issue in Brisbane a year ago when he said family violence was \u201ca disgrace\u201d, adding \u201cwe should have zero tolerance for this\u201d. But Baulch said: \u201cthere was a lot of disappointment in the sector because family violence has since dropped off Coag\u2019s agenda\u201d. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything more from the federal government since Coag met around this time last year, which is disappointing,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cI believe they have produced a report, but my feeling is that it\u2019s pretty disappointing. Governments haven\u2019t continued that level of conversation at the Coag level.\u201d However, she praised the Victorian government for committing to significant reforms as part of $1.9bn family violence package. She said it was disappointing that some other states and territories were not following Victoria\u2019s lead, though she praised the Queensland government for also making significant investments into the sector. \u201cVictoria has so many lessons for the rest of the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThe findings from the royal commission into family violence about broken and underfunded systems and lack of communication between agencies are lessons for all of us. In NSW we have pursued a police and criminal justice response and much of the resource in terms of budget allocation is going into a safer pathway referral system which is really important. But ultimately we need those frontline services like refuges and longterm housing funded long term. \u201cWe know what works when it comes to addressing domestic and family violence, and that\u2019s a well-resourced, specialist service system and housing. Investments in both are lacking in NSW.\u201d Guardian Australia has contacted the federal minister for women, Michaelia Cash, for comment. The NSW minister for the prevention of family violence, Pru Goward, did not respond directly to concerns that not enough was being done. \u201cThe NSW government will continue to work hard to support victim-survivors and hold perpetrators to account,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are doing this through providing crisis accommodation and housing support, case management through the court process, and educating perpetrators to address their violence.\u201d The chief executive of Domestic Violence Victoria, Fiona McCormack, said Cash had not contacted her about addressing the issue of family violence since Coag. \u201cIt would be great to see regular conversations occurring between the federal government, Coag, and non-government organisations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a regular mechanism through which to talk to the federal government about this issue.\u201d McCormack said people regularly told her that they wanted government action and investment in family violence, but that the federal government was not meeting these community expectations. \u201cAt a national level we have seen a few steps like the introduction of Australia\u2019s National Research Organisation for Women\u2019s Safety, and we have a national prevention agency, but that\u2019s not anywhere near enough. If you compare the investment to efforts made in national security it\u2019s not enough, despite women and children being murdered at regular intervals.\u201d Cathy Humphreys, a professor of social work from the University of Melbourne, said Coag was concerned with national security but had failed to make the connection between terrorism and family violence. Man Haron Monis, the Lindt cafe gunman in Sydney in 2014, was on bail for allegedly being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, and for more than 40 charges of sexual and indecent assault, at the time he carried out the cafe attack. \u201cTerrorists responsible for a number of attacks also often have a history of domestic violence or have grown up with it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a link between terrorism and intimate partner terrorism.\u201d She said if governments wanted to tackle national security it made sense to also invest funding into preventing family violence. \u201cIt is disappointing that family violence has just dropped off the Coag agenda,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
