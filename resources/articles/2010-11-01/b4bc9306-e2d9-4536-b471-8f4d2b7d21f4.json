First-time screenwriter Moe Jelline probably conceived something much sharper than this, but with the help of producer-director Andy Fickman \u2013 who directed Race to Witch Mountain \u2013 Disney have turned what could have been a wicked little gem into a bland wedding comedy. The premise is great: Kristen Bell plays Marni, a bespectacled, spotty high-school loser who was brutally bulled at school by evil prom queen Joanna (Odette Yusmann); eight years later, with the encouragement of her gentle homemaker mom Gail (Jamie Lee Curtis) she's lost the glasses and triumphantly survived as a babelicious, high-flying PR executive. But then she hears her brother is getting engaged to this same Joanna, who has now creepily reinvented herself as a goody-two-shoes nurse, and sweetly professes not to remember their former acquaintance. Now an orphan, Joanna brings along her aunt to meet the family: wealthy businesswoman Ramona, played by Sigourney Weaver, astonished to see Gail, who turns out to be her former high-school rival. It's a double nightmare: could it be that, like the hateful Joanna, Marni's nice mom was once a loathsome bitch? It's a tremendous idea, but fudged horribly in the execution, because no one's allowed to be really nasty, and the clumsy moments of broad comedy and the cheesy ending look tacked on. I would have liked to see Alexander Payne direct this film in the manner of his 1999 classic Election, and really take us all over to the dark side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
