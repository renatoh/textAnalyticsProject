The former minister for civil society said he had taken the decision because of the \u201cintolerable\u201d media spotlight on himself and his family. The announcement came as another Sunday newspaper claimed it had \u201cuncovered a new shame\u201d about the American-born MP for Braintree in Essex. Newmark, who founded the Women2Win campaign group that aimed to get more women involved in politics, resigned after exchanging suggestive pictures with a Sunday Mirror reporter. The 56-year-old married father-of-five sent a letter to David Cameron on Saturday saying he would not seek re-election in May. He wrote: \u201cThe continued media intrusion into past episodes in my personal life is placing an intolerable burden on my family. I have therefore decided to stand down at the general election. I will continue to serve my constituents to the best of my abilities until that time. \u201cI again appeal to the media to respect my family\u2019s privacy and to give me a chance to try to heal the hurt I have caused them. I have no one to blame but myself and take full responsibility for my own actions. I will remain a loyal supporter of the government and would like to thank the many friends and colleagues for the support and sympathy they have shown me and my family.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
