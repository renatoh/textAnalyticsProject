This live Jazz on 3 recording from the 2013 Cheltenham jazz festival makes the threesome the hot core of an orchestra directed by the Royal Academy of Music's Nick Smart, and though there are occasional moments in which the squeals, slithers and exclamations of the plugged sounds seem to exist in a parallel universe to the sax purrs and luxuriously brassy riffs of the big band, for the most part the venture is an absorbing synthesis. The most successful passages are the ones in which traditional jazz-orchestra methods are most subdued, like Downes's shapely song Elegant Her (in which bluesy guitar figures and glowing keyboard sounds are gently accelerated by pushing trombone lines and then trumpet hits) or Montague's Hip Clan, where a Mike Gibbsian orchestral throb gradually joins the tender guitar line. But the more unceremonious collisions do sometimes display a jangling Django Bates-like audacity, as in the brusque swaps of banshee electronics and jazzy swing hooks on the opening Dry Ops. This fusion is a work in progress, but a productive one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
