Its members, including those condemned by Nick Clegg as \"nutters\" and homophobes, returned refreshed this week with new arrangements devised to stop the multinational rabble from causing so many headaches for David Cameron. Michal Kaminski \u2013 the Polish politician with strange views on wartime fascist massacres, who was in sole charge of the ECR \u2013 and Timothy Kirkhope (aka Captain Mainwaring) will lead the group as joint chairmen. And where will they lead it. Who knows? For just this week, when MEPs voted to condemn President Sarkozy's expulsion of Roma from France, Captain Mainwaring warned that they should not be so hasty. Tories and their unlovely friends abstained. \u2022 And some year for the Green party as members meet in Birmingham for the annual conference. The party, still bright and relatively new, has yet to succumb to the dead hand of sophistry and spin. And yet they realise that some things are best kept under the surface. One such is the claim that too often a sympathy for the plight of Palestinians spills over into full-blown antisemitism. These claims have been made before. That's why the party sought to address them by setting up an antisemitism working group. But good intentions, we understand, were not enough, and thus it apparently became necessary to remove the chair and disband the committee. We have a problem, say worried members. No we don't, says the leadership; and if we do we'll deal with it. It's under the surface for now but bubbling up fast. \u2022 What a carry-on at Westminster, as the News of the World farrago continues and Sky News presenter Kay Burley gets the wrong side of former minister and possible hacking victim Chris Bryant. Can you really say that illegal newsroom practices were \"endemic\", demands Burley. \"I have just said that,\" counters Bryant. \"You seem to be a bit dim.\" \u2022 And what a carry-on at Harrods as the children of Mohamed Al Fayed gather together the flotsam and jetsam of his life for a surprise party to mark his 25 years in charge. Familiar faces everywhere, from GMB union boss Paul Kenny to Manchester United chief exec David Gill, actor Nigel Havers, and Fulham manager Mark Hughes. Also the 3am guys, Kelvin MacKenzie and Andrew Neil. There are videos featuring Hugh Grant, Esther Rantzen and Larry King \u2013 and Donald Trump, admiring the deal struck for the \u00a31.5bn sale of Harrods. Lord Sugar too. And there is cake, a six-foot replica of the golden sphinx, a centrepiece of the Egyptian room in Harrods. And all goes to plan until the appropriately named PR guru Brian Basham accidently knocks its head off. 'Twas fuggin' delicious all the same. \u2022 It's all change at the culture department, where tourism minister John Penrose has rid himself of the \"rather adventurous abstracts\" left behind by the last occupant of his office. Instead, he wants posters. \"Not that iconic photo of Che Guevara,\" blogs Penrose. \"Nor that one of the forgetful girl on the tennis court.\" He wants classic English travel posters. And whose \"adventurous abstracts\" has he returned to storage. Step forward one-time creative industries minister Si\u00f4n Simon, would be mayor of Birmingham, best known for his YouTube impersonations of David Cameron. A new look for the office. And revenge. \u2022 Finally, she is out of parliament and into the sequins of Strictly Come Dancing. But never let it be said that Ann Widdecombe has ceased to be a woman of influence. There is an excess of regulation in the UK and \"micro-managing\" of the public, harrumphed Ann this week. \"Even George Orwell didn't predict microchips in our wheelie bins.\" As for the ills of wider society, \"the reason we goldplate everything is the compensation culture, where backstroke is being banned from schools not because of health and safety, but because they think they might get sued\". She was on fine form, but then she has always had a way with an audience. The Heating and Ventilating Contractors' Association hung on her every word."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
