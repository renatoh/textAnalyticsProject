Or at least, Ucas the soap opera. This week, UK vice-chancellors gathering in Oxford for their annual conference will hear plans for a television channel dedicated to choosing a university. If the idea of 16- and 17-year olds sitting down to watch TV before entering the labyrinth of the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service seems bizarre, the promoters of University Choice TV believe this is an idea whose time has come. They are busy raising around \u00a32m to get their digital channel off the ground, and it's not a charity. With university heads now preoccupied with the impact of tuition fees on their recruitment - some are worried about attracting enough students, others about how they can satisfy the government's demands to broaden access to students from poor families and ethnic minorities - entrepreneurs Shaie Selzer and Michael Kesztenbaum believe they can get enough universities on board to make their venture fly, although they have not been endorsed by Universities UK, which represents all the vice-chancellors. They plan to go on air from September 2005 with a digital channel on which universities will pay between \u00a3200 and \u00a3400 to broadcast their pitches to prospective students. The channel will carry general programmes about going to university and student finance as well as films made by individual institutions or groups wanting to promote a specific subject like engineering. The schedule will be organised regionally and rotated - there will be no primetime slot to be monopolised by a few institutions - and no one university will find itself competing with EastEnders every week. Sir Graeme Davies, vice-chancellor of the University of London, who chairs the company's board, was persuaded the idea was a runner by the figures for satellite television, showing that viewers were more likely to be from low-income groups and ethnic minorities - the groups higher education is desperate to reach out to. The Schwartz report on access today could hardly have been better timed for the channel's promoters. More than 50% of UK households have digital TV but that rises to 75% of households that have 16- to 18-year olds, says Selzer, who is confident that three out of four of the age group will thus be able to watch their channel via Sky. The channel will also be available as a broadband service, tapping into the 4 million broadband subscribers in the UK. Sir Graeme adds: \"It's a route to the part of the potential student population who are difficult to get to. It's as near a magic bullet as you can get.\" Plenty of universities already have promotional videos but the quality, as Selzer tactfully puts it, is mixed. Part of the channel's role will be to introduce universities and film-makers to each other. And, as he says, they have to make the channel watchable. The funding council has already put up money for a review of current video offerings from universities, which will serve as a starting point and identify the best ones in the field for other institutions to emulate. Goldsmiths College, University of London, is reputed to have one of the best - its 12-minute video made in 2001 by students and recent graduates won a silver medal from the US-based Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (Case) and the revised version won a gold medal this year. There was also a bronze award from the International Visual Communication Association (Ivca), which hands out gongs to a much wider range of business media. But more gratifying than medals for Goldsmiths were the comments from year 11 students (16-year-olds) who have seen the video. \"It was pretty laid back, arty and cool ... I liked the camerawork a lot ... honest and gritty with the students' personal views ... raised issues like the first day, which are of concern ... good to show samples of actual classes in action ... students seem to tell the truth ... inspired lecturers ... diverse university with cultures and ethnicities ... welcoming environment ... friendly people ... it made me feel I could fit in.\" Goldsmiths, which has a reputation for arts and media, has also been paid the compliment of being imitated by other universities with its attempt to get away from the \"talking vice-chancellor\" style of video. \"Next time round we will look at a complete reshooting. We've noticed a few people have nicked our ideas. We want to keep it ahead of the game,\" said a spokeswoman. Three years ago, people were not thinking in terms of DVDs, but that looks an obvious omission now. The video with a gentle musical track - laid back or dull, depending on your taste - shows glimpses of the university's departments and impressions in students' own unscripted words. Actually the student I happened to watch it with found it pretty dull and was irritated by the lack of useful information it conveyed, but then he already knows what being at university is like and the video is presumably aimed at an age group with little idea - and perhaps false impressions - of what to expect, or what range of things they can study. It will be interesting to see if universities can tap into their students' creativity when it comes to making items for the new channel. Even so, it is hard to imagine anyone watching much of this sort of thing at a time. Selzer, however, is convinced UCTV will fit the channel-flicking habits of teenagers who have music, TV and computer going at the same time. He says UCTV will bring open days into the homes of university entrants in a way not possible through a website or prospectus. \"Typically, students base their decision on information from prospectuses, websites, and hearsay. There is no guarantee that schools will give good advice, and applicants will typically attend only one or two open days.\" The channel is promoting itself not only as a means for universities and colleges to reach a million potential entrants but for subjects struggling to recruit students to make their case as well. Physics, engineering and modern languages could all benefit from a bit of positive publicity, a point picked up by Sir Graeme and also by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce). But the biggest attraction for many universities is the hope of reaching disaffected 16-year-olds and teenagers who just don't consider that higher education is something for them. Selzer will emphasise the point this week when he talks to vice-chancellors in the Victorian setting of Keble College, Oxford. \"With almost 50% of young people applying to university, many families have no experience of the sector,\" says Selzer. \"The demographics of digital television are ideal for reaching these sections of the population. In particular, UCTV is well placed to recruit students from ethnic minorities, as digital television is the principal source of special-interest programmes for these groups.\" Market research by NOP for the company suggests nearly half of 15- to 19-year-olds would be very or quite interested in getting information on colleges and universities via television but this rose to over 50% among 15- to 17-year-olds, the real target audience. On a class breakdown of the survey, it was the C2 youngsters who were most interested in receiving this information from television. Here Selzer and Kesztenbaum seem to have struck lucky, launching just at a time when the government is giving universities special funds to promote wider access. To their delight, Hefce has confirmed that this money may be spent on videos and broadcasts. John Rushforth, director of widening participation at Hefce, has written to Selzer. \"We see universities or colleges which elect to represent their institutions on this channel as adopting a specific measure designed to increase their effectiveness in widening participation, thereby attracting students from groups that had hitherto been under-represented within higher education ... Any institution could choose to use part of the funds we allocate for widening participation funds for this purpose.\" So if teenagers can be tempted to watch UCTV that could well keep the new watchdog, the Office for Fair Access (Offa), from the door of Oxbridge and other Russell group institutions with an embarrassing lack of working- class applicants. Sir David Watson, vice-chancellor of Brighton, is a member of UCTV's advisory board and calls the channel a clever idea. \"The bottom line is the relationship between late teenagers and the screen. They are the screen-age generation. They are hooked on MTV. If we could get a message inserted somewhere in there, there are lots of institutions with high-quality video and film records of what they do.\" Brighton is currently trawling through film and video footage of student activities, particularly in the creative arts and sport, as the basis for material to broadcast. Promotional videos are, of course, only a small part of the task facing British universities in the dawning era of variable undergraduate fees, which will be discussed at the Universities UK conference this week. Pricing will be crucial in some cases, even if the majority of institutions are publicly intent on showing they could charge top rate. But frank discussion here will be inhibited by the rules on cartel price-fixing that have already prompted an investigation into possible collusion between independent schools. More pressing concerns about what happens to the universities' share of funds in the government's spending review will be aired more frankly. Has the departing higher education minister, Alan Johnson, left negotiations with the Treasury in good shape? His old boss, the education secretary, Charles Clarke, will be there to address them but will not be in a position to reveal much about the spending review. But one aspect of this week's conference is clear: it won't feature in a promotional video. That would be a challenge too far for the most adventurous film-maker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
