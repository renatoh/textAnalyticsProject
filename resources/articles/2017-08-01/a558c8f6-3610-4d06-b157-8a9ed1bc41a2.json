The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) has run an initiative since 2005 encouraging expectant mothers to give birth without medical interventions including epidurals, inductions and caesareans. Approximately 40% of mothers give birth without medical interventions, compared to three decades ago when 60% did so. The midwifery trade union will instead start to use the term \u201cphysiological births\u201d to describe those without interventions as part of an overhaul of professional guidelines but will not change its view that childbirth without medical intervention is best for many women. Prof Cathy Warwick, the chief executive of the RCM, denied that the decade-long campaign had compromised the safety of new mothers but admitted it had created the wrong impression. \u201cThere was a danger that if you just talk about normal births \u2013 and particularly if you call it a campaign \u2013 it kind of sounds as if you\u2019re only interested in women who have a vaginal birth without intervention,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to do is in any way contribute to any sense that a woman has failed because she hasn\u2019t had a normal birth. Unfortunately that seems to be how some women feel.\u201d The campaign was criticised in an inquiry into the deaths of 16 babies and three mothers at Furness general hospital in Cumbria between 2004 and 2013. The investigation found that a \u201clethal mix\u201d of failings led to the unnecessary deaths of 11 babies and one mother treated at the hospital\u2019s maternity unit, part of the Morecambe Bay NHS foundation trust. It found that midwives, calling themselves \u201cthe musketeers\u201d, contributed to unsafe deliveries due to their desire to see the women give birth without medical interventions \u201cat any cost\u201d. Their relationship with doctors at the trust was described as \u201cseriously dysfunctional\u201d with reports of midwives neglecting to alert doctors in time about patient complications. The inquiry, chaired by Dr Bill Kirkup, said the hospital\u2019s maternity services were beset by a culture of denial, collusion and incompetence. Kirkup, speaking after the publication of the report in March 2015, said: \u201cOur findings are stark and catalogue a series of failures at almost every level \u2013 from the maternity unit to those responsible for regulating and monitoring the trust. The nature of these problems is serious and shocking.\u201d Warwick said she did not believe midwives would have looked at the \u201cnormal births\u201d campaign and thought it meant pushing normal birth \u201cbeyond the point of safety. \u201cClearly some midwives were identified as doing that at Morecambe Bay but I\u2019ve got no evidence that was fostered by anything the RCM was doing.\u201d James Titcombe, whose son Joshua was one of the babies who died in Morecambe Bay, welcomed the end of the campaign. \u201cThis was a top-down, blunt campaign designed to influence how midwives made decisions at absolutely critical moments. It was implemented without any risk assessment, testing or evaluation and I believe it\u2019s had disastrous consequences,\u201d he said. Regarding the change in language that will form part of the childbirth initiative, Warwick said: \u201cIt does seem that this word \u2018normal\u2019 is particularly contentious \u2026 it is simpler to use a non-value-laden word. Because of the inferences that are drawn there will be instances where you\u2019re explaining your position better by using terms like \u2018physiological birth\u2019.\u201d In June the former maternity risk manager at Furness general hospital told the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) she that it should strike her off. Jeanette Parkinson admitted that she had failed to investigate a colleague\u2019s shortcomings concerning the deaths of the babies at the hospital and that her own fitness to practise as a senior midwife was impaired. She is the seventh midwife to be investigated as a result of the scandal, in which two have been struck off and another suspended. An investigation into the NMC\u2019s handling of complaints against the midwives was announced last week after concerns were raised by the Department of Health. It will be carried out by the professional standards authority and look at the NMC\u2019s approach to managing complaints, administering them and its relationships with witnesses. The review is expected to take six months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
