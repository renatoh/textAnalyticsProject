After exploring his classics for years, she has finally devoted an album to him. Like Cohen (who brought violins, mandolins and organs to his 2013 tour), Tobin appreciates the importance of wrapping subtle instrumental tones around the merciless lyrics \u2013 in this case Phil Robson's guitar (bluesy on Tower of Song, African on Suzanne, jazzy on the title track), Huw Warren's borderline-abstract accordion, Dave Whitford's warmly recorded bass and Adriano Adewale's soft percussion. Warren scythes through Tobin's wide and resonant account of Famous Blue Raincoat, Miles Davis's In a Silent Way gets threaded into the arrangement of Tower of Song, Take This Waltz is sombre and playful at once (its busyness seems to free Tobin to be at her most revealingly offhand), Anthem is a haunting duet with Gwilym Simcock's piano, and Dance Me to the End of Love features Nick Smart's fluent trumpet alongside Robson over a sensuous groove. It's a heartfelt gift for Cohen in his 80th birthday year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
