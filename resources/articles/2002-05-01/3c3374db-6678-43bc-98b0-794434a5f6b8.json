The crowd greet her request with wild enthusiasm. \"I haven't even started!\" shrieks Miss Motivator. No wonder she was invited to perform at the Beckhams' pre-World Cup party last week - her punishing routines would certainly keep the attending England party fit. Everybody, from celebrities such as Posh and Nelson Mandela to countless ordinary mortals, seems to like this grinning 27-year-old. Despite the pauses between songs being accompanied by audible audience panting, she is soon getting the entire crowd to sing: \"I feel good. This is the best day of my life.\" The combination of exercise-induced endorphins and spiritually uplifting soul is utterly infectious. Knight has known bad times, from her poor upbringing in Wolverhampton to enduring racist housing departments in Cheltenham. That makes her positivity real, not showbiz. She pulls it off because we feel good about her. Knight has touches of the diva about her - think Miss Ross and Janet Jackson - but she also seems like a genuine girl next door. When her band power out heavy-metal chords, her Black Country tones explode: \"What the bloody 'ell comes next?\" Somehow, there may be a direct lineage between Knight and Ozzy Osbourne. The show is rawer then her records, with an excellent rhythm section ensuring that even ballads hit hard. When she unleashes her full vocal range on Bestseller Mystery, stomach muscles harden. Seconds later, she dedicates Fallen Soldier to Stephen Lawrence and lambasts the \"failure\" of the public enquiry. Her tears are real. Perhaps Knight lacks the one true classic song to propel her past gold-album status and into superstardom. Not one but two covers (Chaka Khan's I Feel for You and a surprisingly effective reggae take on Kylie's Can't Get You Out of My Head) implies a shortage of top material. However, with her awareness of different genres and her boundless enthusiasm, she should get there. \"Get up!\" cries Knight as the dancing becomes just too painful. Still, at least she spares us the press-ups. \u00b7 Beverley Knight plays Shepherd's Bush Empire, London (020-7771 2000), tonight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
