Three days of clashes in the capital Kingston have left western parts of the city resembling a war zone, with burnt-out vehicles and bullet-raked buildings. The dead included police officers and local residents, who had set up road blocks in defiance of armed police raids that sparked the trouble on Saturday. The authorities had been searching for guns in a bid to quell gang fighting. Last night the violence threatened to spread across the Caribbean island as a policeman was killed in a parish neighbouring the popular holiday area of Montego Bay. Today, tourist chiefs sought to reassure holidaymakers that the danger was now over. Derek Whittingham, London manager of the Jamaican Tourist Board, said: \"It's quietening down. It was confined to the western area of Kingston and has not affected the northern coast resorts of Montego Bay and Ocho Rios. People can go there. \"If tourists have a car and are driving to Kingston they should certainly be aware of the situation and be vigilant.\" The Association of British Travel Agents said: \"We are monitoring the situation closely but it has not affected tourists and has now calmed down. \"It was pretty much confined to the western part of Kingston, which is never, at the best of times, a suggested destination for British tourists.\" The current Foreign Office advice to travellers is to avoid any of the areas affected by demonstrations, listen to local radio stations for updates and take care on the road to the airport. Jamaica has one of the highest murder rates in the world. About 530 people have been killed this year. That figure does not include about 75 people killed by police between January and last week - which the police said were in self-defence and that human rights groups claim were summary executions. The Jamaica tourist board in London said today the Jamaican government was \"securing the troubled areas to ensure the disturbances are contained\". About 135,000 Britons visited Jamaica last year, 8% more than in 1999.
