The subject matter is difficult enough; a story set in the so-called crucible of terror, on the border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan, focusing on the Pashtun community, requiring the trust of that community to make the film. On top of that, it was made for less money than some films spend on catering in a day, and by a nurse from Sydney, Benjamin Gilmour, who had never made a movie before. The film has just started a limited run in Britain, at a time when the country is agonising over its involvement in the conflicts in that region. After being released abroad, Gilmour's film has won critical acclaim, all the more satisfying given the incredulity of film bosses when they heard his proposal. \"How naive I was, cold-calling BBC films, asking them to fund a unit nurse with no directing experience wanting to shoot a feature drama in locations even BBC news crews can't get access to,\" Gilmour says. \"But I pitched it, and they laughed. But I suppose its part of the pleasure mingling at A-list film festival parties with those who once told me I was insane.\" The film is set in the town of Darra Adam Khel, in the tribal area of Pakistan. Gilmour did not bother trying to get a permit from the Pakistani government to film, he just turned up in the area. The town hosts gun manufacturing, and almost resembles a place from the American wild west. The locals came to trust him, and became the actors in the film: \"I was moving freely in areas a foreign soldier would have lasted less than a few minutes. This would not have been possible without the protection of the tribes. I don't think I was crazy, brazen perhaps, but not crazy.\" The Pashtuns saw the project as a way to tell their story and improve their image in the west, which has been tarnished by association with terrorism and radicalism. For Gilmour, he learned not just how to make a film, but how to work with a proud people. The Pashtuns themselves came up with the dialogue: \"I realised early on, while trying to direct this film that Pashtuns, in fact, cannot be directed. They can certainly be negotiated with, reasoned with, but never told what to do. When I tried this in my first week of shooting, resistance was immediate.\" Relying on the Pashtuns to come up with the script led to some comedy moments in the film. There is a great barbershop scene where the men refer to their beards as their \"al-Qaidas\". The way the film and script developed help deliver a movie that while accessible to western audiences, has an authentic and nuanced Pashtun voice, says Gilmour: \"Son of a Lion may romanticise the Pashtuns to a degree, but it does not romanticise radicalism. With this film I wanted to make clear the difference between Pashtun culture and Islam. Pashtuns have historically considered themselves Pashtun first and Muslim second.\" The film centres on a boy, Niaz, whose father wants him to continue in the family gun-making business. Niaz, with support from his uncle, wants an education, believing that gives him the best chance of a better life. \"Considering all we seem to get in the news is anti-Pashtun, those involved in Son of a Lion saw the making of this film as a way of showing the world a slice of life in the tribal belt,\" Gilmour says. \"In the midst of intense Pakistani propaganda on one side and Taliban propaganda on the other, the Pashtuns are clutching at opportunities to regain ground for the culture on the verge of its obliteration.\" Son of a Lion is screening at the Ultimate Picture Palace, Oxford, on Sunday, then tours. sonofalion.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
