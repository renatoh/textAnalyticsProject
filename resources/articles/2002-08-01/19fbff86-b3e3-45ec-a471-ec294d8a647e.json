The British board of film classification said Sir Quentin Thomas would replace Andreas Whittam-Smith as its president. Mr Whittam-Smith resigned recently after four years in the post to take up a job with the Church of England. The new president, who is 58, has experience of film classification issues from his time in the Home Office between 1984 and 1988, when he worked on obscenity and film censorship. Latterly he worked in the Northern Ireland Office, where he was knighted for \"services to peace\", and most recently on constitutional reform, before leaving the civil service in 1999. Sir Quentin praised the BBFC model - the board is self-funded - on taking up the role. \"At a time when the arrangements for overall regulation for the media and telecoms are being revised, the need for a separate body dedicated to prior classification of films and videos is clear, as the government has recognised.\" Sir Quentin's appointment as president was decided by the BBFC after \"open competition\", although it is likely government opinion was canvassed. Upon its return, parliament will be asked to designate the new president as one of the people qualified to classify video releases. In the meantime, the BBFC's vice-presidents are both empowered to do this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
