The going price for renting out a luxury house near where the champion football game will be played can exceed the country\u2019s median per capita income of $28,155. The promise of that kind of payday is prompting some homeowners to test the waters of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb for the first time. \u201cIf someone wants to pay us a bunch [of] silly money for the Super Bowl, we\u2019ll go stay at my mother\u2019s for a few days,\u201d said Michael, who is listing his family\u2019s five-bedroom home (featuring a swimming pool, workout room, and Buddhist statuary in a 1.5-acre garden) in tony Hillsborough for $7,000 a night on Airbnb. Asking for a minimum stay of four nights, Michael is pessimistic that anyone will bite. He\u2019s never rented his home on Airbnb before but says many of his friends and neighbors are interested in taking a flyer on the Super Bowl. (Several people interviewed asked that their last names be withheld because Airbnb is so contentious in San Francisco.) \u201cI heard the Travelodge was charging $1,100/night,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is more crazy.\u201d The choicest chateau on offer may be a 4,500sq ft house with a heated pool, daily maid service, and five-acre estate listed on Craigslist for $50,001 for the week (3 February to 8 February). The suburban house in Saratoga has been sitting on the market with an asking price of almost $5m, so a quick injection of cash would probably be welcome by the owners, though the listing agent declined to comment. Lest you think that $50,000 rental price is all inclusive, the advertisement warns that any \u201cvery \u2018High Profile\u2019 Person\u201d wishing to rent should \u201csupply your own security team\u201d. Serena is another first-time Airbnb host to be tempted by the promise of Super Bowl riches. She\u2019s advertising her four-bedroom home in San Mateo at $6,500 a night. If she finds a taker, she says her family will head out of town to visit her daughter at college and use the money to pay for her children\u2019s summer travels. Though Airbnb doesn\u2019t have statistics on how many people have been spurred by the big game to sign up as hosts for the first time, the San Francisco-based startup says that demand for Super Bowl pads in its home turf is three times higher than it was for the 2015 championship, which was held in Arizona. Still, some longtime Airbnb hosts aren\u2019t sure they would accept a Super Bowl renter. Stephanie regularly rents a single bedroom in her four-bedroom home in the Mission district for $150 a night. Her family was already planning to be out of town during the Super Bowl, so, at the urging of friends, she\u2019s listing the entire home for $5,000 a night. Still, she\u2019s not sure that she even wants to rent it. \u201cI\u2019m not that interested in having random people in my house when I\u2019m not at home, so it\u2019s listed at a super high price,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if we get inquiries, we would have to think hard about whether to accept them.\u201d Others are purposely eschewing the price-gouging that accompanies major events. Ryan, who also didn\u2019t want his last name used, offers beds in an apartment in Sunnyvale for just $29 a night. He says he doesn\u2019t want to let a big event like the Super Bowl \u201cdeter or affect the ongoing culture and dynamics of the environment, which is to promote the entrepreneurial spirit\u201d. Nathan, who rents out bunkbeds in Palo Alto, is also keeping his prices at their normal $35 per night rate. Asked why he wasn\u2019t taking advantage of the Super Bowl to make more money, he responded: \u201cBecause I\u2019m highly selective. I only take people who are associated with Stanford.\u201d There\u2019s also the question of karma. Jazen, a verified Airbnb \u201cSuperhost\u201d with properties in Mountain View and Sunnyvale, is keeping his normal rates \u2013 which range from $60 for a single room to $169 for a two-bedroom. He caters to business travelers in the tech industry and wants to keep it that way. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been rejecting a lot of inquiries from Super Bowl spectators and prefer not to host them,\u201d he said, pointing out that his rooms don\u2019t include televisions and he \u201cpersonally [has] no interest in most mainstream sports\u201d. \u201cObnoxious price-gouging may invite obnoxious guests, so I avoid it altogether.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
