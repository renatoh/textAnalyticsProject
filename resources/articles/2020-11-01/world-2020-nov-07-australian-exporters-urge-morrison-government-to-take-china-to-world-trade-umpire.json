As seven export sectors braced for potential trade bans, and with ministerial level contact still frozen, the Australian Industry Group told Guardian Australia businesses would have no choice but to look for other markets \u201cif China continues to turn its back on Australian goods and services\u201d. While the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, described the new sanctions as \u201crumours\u201d that have not been officially confirmed, Australian trade officials have urged exporters to expand into other markets because the rocky relationship between the two countries is not likely to improve in the near future. In an editorial, the state-run China Daily warned that Australia would \u201cpay tremendously for its misjudgment\u201d if it continued to back the US government\u2019s efforts to contain China. The paper urged Australia to \u201csteer clear of Washington\u2019s brinkmanship with China before it is too late\u201d, saying that if Canberra went out of its way to be hostile to Beijing it \u201cwill be a decision Australia will come to regret as its economy will only suffer further pain\u201d. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said it was time for Scott Morrison to \u201cact like the prime minister, not the prime observer\u201d and move quickly to help Australian exporters who fear new trade bans affecting wine, lobster, sugar, coal, timber, barley and copper. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to say, \u2018Well, no one will take our calls\u2019 while our trade continues to deteriorate,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThe government needs a plan to deal with this issue, because it has real-world consequences for Australian jobs, for Australian businesses and for the Australian economy.\u201d If these new bans eventuate, they would represent the latest in a series of trade actions taken by China amid tensions over a range of issues, including Australian investigations into alleged foreign interference, criticism of China over human rights abuses, and the Morrison government\u2019s early call for a global Covid inquiry. Australian barley exports to China have already largely stopped because of prohibitive 80% tariffs imposed in May, based on claims the product had been \u201cdumped\u201d at artificially low prices and because of unfair subsidies. The Australian government says it reserves its right to challenge that decision via the World Trade Organization and it is understood to have raised its concerns at a standard WTO committee meeting last week. Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, said businesses would prefer Australia to have strong high-level connections with China, which accounts for 33% of Australia\u2019s total exports, but \u201cwhen talks break down we need to rely on the independent umpire, the WTO\u201d. \u201cChina and Australia have long been united in advocating for the multilateral trading system and now might be the time to take our disagreements to that forum,\u201d he said. \u201cBusinesses are always looking to diversify but the reality is that no other market has the size or robust demand of China, which is why Australia is just one of 125 countries who count China as their largest trading partner.\u201d Dr Jeffrey Wilson, the research director of the Perth USAsia Centre, said referring the trade dispute to the independent umpire was a credible option for Australia, even though it could take some time for a decision. Wilson said he believed Australia had a \u201cvery good chance of success\u201d in the barley, cotton and coal cases. The latter two products have reportedly faced disruptions because Chinese authorities issued verbal instructions to certain businesses last month to stop buying from Australia. On the eve of the potential new trade bans, Austrade officials held a phone hook-up with farming and business representatives on Thursday, the contents of which were first reported by the Australian newspaper. \u201cQuite frankly they didn\u2019t tell us anything we didn\u2019t know,\u201d said a source from one of the affected sectors who was on the call. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t confirm any facts [about the potential new trade disruptions]. They basically said the relationship with China is poor and it doesn\u2019t look like any chance of that improving in the foreseeable future. \u201cThe main thing was you need to look to diversify your markets.\u201d It is understood officials also urged exporters to ensure they complied with all labelling and other technical requirements because there was likely to be increased scrutiny at Chinese ports. While the message was consistent with the government\u2019s previous public calls for trade diversification and warnings that the risk of doing business with China was increasing, it reflects heightened anxiety about how long the trade tensions may last. Describing the phone hook-up as routine, Birmingham said the government was talking to sectors that were \u201cconcerned, understandably, given the media speculating and the rumours circulating about their trade with China\u201d. Birmingham said the government realised \u201cthat the best environment for our exporters to operate in is one in which they have the maximum number of choices available to them\u201d so businesses had the opportunity \u201cto pivot\u201d. That was why, the trade minister stressed, the government had either signed or was pursuing trade agreements with Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, Mexico, Indonesia, the European Union and the United Kingdom, along with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Birmingham said it was \u201cdisappointing that Chinese authorities refuse to engage\u201d in talks at a ministerial level but Australia \u201cstands willing to have that type of mature, responsible dialogue\u201d. \u201cI note that Chinese authorities have given assurances, both publicly through their media spokespeople, and privately, that there is no concerted action of discrimination against Australia, and we want to make sure that they live up to those commitments.\u201d Guardian Australia understands while there has been no official confirmation of customs blockages in the targeted sectors, the uncertainty has already led some exporters to suspend or delay shipments. China\u2019s foreign ministry rebuffed Birmingham\u2019s call for clarity after the state-run Global Times appeared to confirm that China had \u201chalted seven categories of Australian goods from the market\u201d but did not provide any further details. The foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, offered a general comment on Thursday that any measures on foreign imports were \u201cin line with Chinese laws and regulations and international customary practices\u201d. \u201cThey protect the safety of consumers and the legitimate rights and interests of domestic industries, and are consistent with the free trade agreement between China and Australia,\u201d Wang said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
