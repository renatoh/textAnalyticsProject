Decca had also made a stereo recording, and did eventually release that in the 1970s, but until now it has never been transferred to CD. Testament's release makes a wonderful complement to the label's ongoing Bayreuth Ring cycle, also conducted by Keilberth and recorded at the same festival. One singer was involved in both projects, too: such a feat may be almost unthinkable today, but as well as singing Br\u00fcnnhilde in the Ring performances, Astrid Varnay was Senta in the Dutchman. Her singing, with its fabulous range of colour and expression, is one of the glories of this set, Herman Uhde's wonderfully human Dutchman is another. Above all, though, it is Keilberth's conducting that makes this such an involving experience. He obtains superlative playing from the orchestra - the overture is a gripping microcosm of the drama to come - as well as galvanising the chorus. It's wonderfully theatrical."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
