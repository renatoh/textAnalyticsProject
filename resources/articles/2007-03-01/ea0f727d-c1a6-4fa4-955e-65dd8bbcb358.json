Also to council leader and prospective Tory parliamentary candidate Mike Freer, who told the Barnet Times that he really did not see \"how people could find this offensive\", since Cllr Gordon had \"previously dressed up as other world leaders, including Tony Blair and Ronald Reagan\". The boy Cameron, it would seem, still has some work to do. \u00b7 Next, an apology. For some reason, we imagined that because he's very well-known and works for the radio, referring to legendary broadcaster Stuart Maconie as \"some bloke at Radio 2 called Stuart Marconi\" might, to some small post-ironic degree, have amused. How stupid can we get? We just hope it doesn't mean you'll now all be wondering whether the plants manager at Kelways Nursery near Wincanton in Somerset really is called Mr David Root. Because he is. Although that isn't funny. \u00b7 Meanwhile, our favourite foaming patriot, Romford-based bulldog-fancier Andrew Rosindell MP, continues his noble quest to ensure the union flag is flown from every public building in the empire. \"To ask the secretary of state for defence,\" inquires Andrew in a characteristically forceful written question, \"whether the union flag is flown from the Ministry of Defence main building on each day of the year\". Thank heavens someone still cares. \u00b7 According to the New Scientist, because they usually think they've slept well but have, in fact, not, sharing a bed with a woman \"temporarily impairs a man's brainpower\". This could explain many things, if we could only think of them. \u00b7 Thrilling news from Focus Ross-shire, Lib Dem MSP Jamie Stone's constituency freesheet. \"Sharon and the rabbit kept walking. It was very peaceful and the sun was setting gracefully behind the shock of trees at the far end of the grounds,\" we learn from the page headed Railway Promise Delivered. \"She looked around, but the garden was empty. Perhaps nobody else knew about it?\" Blimey. Perhaps nobody else did. \u00b7 In further important Scottish news, BBC Scotland reports that after an 11-day undercover operation involving officers from both Central Scotland CID and the force's tactical crime unit, a Tullibody woman faces jail after admitting the theft of 132 garden ornaments, including 30 gnomes and literally dozens of rabbits, birds and hedgehogs, from a 20-mile radius around her home. Detective Constable Roy Lake comments: \"This is a significant achievement made by officers investigating a number of reported thefts across the area\" - and who are we, frankly, to argue? \u00b7 Mr Broon, beware. \"I might stand for election myself, to be quite honest,\" that nice Noel Gallagher confessed to Radio 1's Newsbeat at the Teenage Cancer Trust gig in comments that, strangely, have not been given a great deal of publicity. \"I've worked this out. I reckon I could sort it out, the country, in a year and a half. I'd definitely bring back hanging, that's for starters. If you get convicted three times by three separate juries then you're going to the gallows, and if by any chance some evidence comes up that you may have been innocent and they can prove it beyond reasonable doubt then your next of kin gets \u00a3500,000. Vote for me.\" You bet! \u00b7 Elsewhere, we are indebted to the Grand Rapids Press for the encouraging news that about 15m gallons of partially treated sewage water has disappeared from a 250,000 square-foot storage lagoon in Kent County, Michigan, \"but officials don't know where it went after that\". Alert readers may recall that Michigan has been the scene of considerable squirrel activity in recent months. But that's probably just a coincidence. diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
