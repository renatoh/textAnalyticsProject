Opportunity missed! I had been hoping to spot our bald, bespectacled, bookshelf-loving federal arts minister to seek clarification, between our no doubt mutual bedazzlement at handsome, bearded Simon Gleeson \u2013 accepting his statue for best male actor in a musical \u2013 the wonderful revamped piece of international commercial theatre, Les Mis\u00e9rables, or smart Cate Blanchett presenting best play to Belvoirfor its beautifully crafted take on Tennessee Williams\u2019s The Glass Menagerie \u2013 for which Pamela Rabe deservedly won best female actor in a play. I wanted to know: when the senator wrote in the program that we were gathered here to \u201crecognise artistic achievement and excellence\u201d, were we not also honouring the fragile bedrock of small-stage training and excellence and innovation upon which such prestigious artistic achievement is built? Did he think about what the Helpmanns mean for the state of theatre in Australia? I did. So did those applauding the on-stage allusions to some muddled ministerial dance steps. Certainly, most of the theatre companies nominated were from the 28 major performing arts companies Brandis has quarantined from budget cuts, first in 2014 when the Abbott government cut $100m from the arts over four years, including $28m from the Australia Council, which dispenses theatre funds, and sheltered again in 2015 when the senator sequestered $104.8m over four years, at the expense of the Australia Council, for his in-house national \u201cexcellence\u201d arts program. He hadn\u2019t bothered to warn the Australia Council, or the public, of his looming budget raid this year. Excellence is set to become increasingly unmoored from the democratic peer review expertise designed to spot its potential in infancy. Newly released guidelines do nothing to allay fears Brandis will play favourites with arts funding decisions. The National Program for Excellence in the Arts will use \u201cat least three assessors\u201d for each grant \u2013 chosen and appointed by the ministry, and including ministry personnel. The small to medium arts organisations and individual artists will scramble for what\u2019s left. Still, it\u2019s important to ask: where and how did these performers honoured on Monday hone their craft? Cream rises to the top, provided we manage to find it first. When Live Performance Australia\u2019s president, Andrew Kay, stood on stage and pointed out that tiny arts companies too are \u201cpart of Australia\u2019s cultural ecosystem, but being small, they are also the most vulnerable, and warrant our ongoing support\u201d, did the senator nod sagely? When the New South Wales arts minister, Troy Grant, took a dig that he was \u201cpleased to be here as an arts minister that didn\u2019t cut funding\u201d, did his federal ministerial counterpart (and party colleague) throw his head towards the ceiling cornices and laugh? Whether physically seated beside us or not, we felt the chill of George Brandis\u2019s judgment on Monday night. Sure, this award ceremony in large part had a safe, fiscally pleasing streak, its final gong for the night awarding best musical to one of four imported commercial ideas. Nominees were Once, the tale of Irish troubadour lovers staged by veteran John Frost and the Melbourne theatre company; Anything Goes, the Frost-Opera Australia collaboration starring the delightful best female musical actor, Caroline O\u2019Connor; the twee Dirty Dancing (film turned into live pantomime); and Cameron Mackintosh\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables, that also has its home at the Capitol \u2013 as if we didn\u2019t know from the raising of the red flag for the opening number. But there were also home-grown artistic hopes on the hill. In particular, The Rabbits, a children\u2019s opera-musical fantasia beloved of critics and Perth festival audiences of all ages, and soon to be seen at Melbourne festival, with composer Kate Miller Heidke, librettist Lally Katz and arranger-composer Iain Grandage accepting the Helpmann for best new Australian work, best children\u2019s work, best score, and best costume design. Did it strike Brandis that here was the little West Australian theatre company, Barking Gecko, scooping four awards in staging The Rabbits as an Opera Australia co-production, in association with the West Australian Opera and commissioned by two arts festivals, in an act of fabulous collaboration. The Australia Council managed the project as part of the federal government\u2019s major festivals initiative, and the Confederation of Australian International Arts Festivals selects such projects for support and manages their development. When Blanchett presented the statue for the best play, Brandis would have seen nominee Calpurnia Descending, credited in his glossy program as a Malthouse Theatre and Sydney Theatre Company co-production, both major performing arts companies. But it was more remarkably a wildly fantastic collaboration between the cabaret star Paul Capsis and the Melbourne queer theatre troupe Sisters Grimm, who began presenting works in abandoned shopfronts and a backyard shed. Hurrah for innovation and excellence and entrepreneurship among the tiny-to-small-to-medium sector. But I doubt the senator would have snapped up a ticket to Sisters Grimm\u2019s first staging of Little Mercy in a Collingwood car park. As Belvoir\u2019s The Glass Menagerie took best play and Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s Kip Williams won best director for Suddenly Last Summer, the ceremony heralded a healthy changing of the guard, with Menagerie\u2019s director Eamon Flack about to assume Belvoir\u2019s artistic director mantle and Williams surely a frontrunner for the top Sydney job when Andrew Upton bows out at the end of the year. The Helpmanns demonstrated the deep well of stage talent Australia possesses, partly by design, within a desirable, appropriate politically remote process. They remind us we have great playwrights such as Joanna Murray-Smith (Switzerland) and theatrical innovators (Sisters Grimm duo Declan Greene and Ash Flanders), even though we do still rely heavily for our biggest stages on the 2oth century canon of Tennessee Williams and Samuel Beckett (Endgame, for which Hugo Weaving won best actor in a play). Sometimes, new, wholly original Australian works are billed as sideshows. But to achieve ongoing excellence in creation and performance requires nurturing of the rabbits, the little theatrical brothers and wicked stage sisters. That\u2019s a feat that cannot be achieved by a self-appointed arts tsar-wizard in Canberra, pulling his own well-worn lever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
