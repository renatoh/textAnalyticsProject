Tottenham joined Arsenal in coming to grief at the Premiership's other Lane, although there was no nail-biting, last-minute drama here. Even after being gifted a goal before many spectators had found their seats, Spurs were surprisingly hopeless and never looked like matching United's commitment, let alone getting back into the game once they went behind. There was no Aaron Lennon, but that's not really an excuse for impersonating England. United made the sort of start a team hovering two places above the drop zone does not need, going a goal down inside two minutes through comedy defending guaranteed to keep Neil Warnock awake at night. Actually it was more a case of non-existent defending, as if the Blades' back line had not noticed the game had kicked off; when Robbie Keane helped on a throw-in, Jermaine Jenas found himself with only Paddy Kenny to beat. He did that with some aplomb, producing a neat lob to leave the goalkeeper stranded, and any United hopes of finding Spurs still traumatised by their mauling at the hands of Manchester United instantly evaporated. Poor defending turned out to be the story of the first half, with Spurs eventually joining in. The visitors should have had the game won as early as the 10th minute, when a mistake by Chris Armstrong let them in again, but Keane selfishly wasted the opportunity with a shot from a tight angle while Dimitar Berbatov and Teemu Tainio waited in vain for a cut back. United then proceeded to leave Berbatov unmarked at a corner, and the striker should have at least hit the target with a free header from close to the penalty spot. When the Blades finally made it to the other end, however, they found the Spurs defence equally shaky, particularly when Colin Kazim-Richards launched crosses towards Rob Hulse and Jon Stead. Hulse was unlucky in the 22nd minute when his header hit the underside of the bar and bounced on the line before Jenas scrambled it away, but the same combination struck again four minutes later when Hulse climbed highest at a corner and scored with a header that seemed less than unstoppable. The ball hit the floor before bouncing over Paul Robinson and every defender on the line; a moment the England goalkeeper is unlikely to regard as one of his finest, though he partly redeemed himself by saving from Hulse before half time. With Stead chipping in with a couple of shots that flew narrowly wide, United could easily have been in front at the interval when they ought to have been out of contention. The game heated up in every sense after an hour, when referee Martin Atkinson got the crowd on its feet by provocatively allowing a Spurs tackle from behind then penalising an identical United one moments later. A baying crowd seems to bring the best out of Warnock's team, though close examination will reveal it was Spurs who self-destructed. There was no need for the rash tackle on Stephen Quinn by Tainio that brought the penalty Phil Jagielka smashed emphatically past Robinson. Spurs protested as if there was room for debate, when it was one of the clearest cases of playing the man rather than the ball you will ever see. Two minutes after that Spurs were lucky to keep 11 men on the field when the referee took a lenient view of a dust-up between Nick Montgomery and Jermain Defoe. Neither could complain about a booking, but Defoe, who had only been on the field for a matter of seconds, clearly struck out at Montgomery's head in a petulant manner, and raised hands are supposed to warrant dismissal. Similarly, while a premeditated foul by Jenas on the same player did not amount to a sending-off offence, a yellow card was barely adequate punishment. While all this nonsense was breaking out around Atkinson, the Blades were keeping their heads and winning the game. All the chances were being created at Robinson's end, and had Quinn been an inch closer to Stead's cross, Spurs might have been put out of their misery long before the end. What's worse than being humiliated by Manchester United? Being outplayed by Sheffield United having been given a goal start. Man of the match: Colin Kazim-Richards What he lacks in \ufb01nesse he makes up for with speed, strength, energy and superb set-piece delivery. He can even come up with a mean long throw. You might as well keep an eye on him because you are unlikely to forget the name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
