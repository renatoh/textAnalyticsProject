Like David Shrigley\u2019s bronze thumbs-up Really Good, Fritsch\u2019s commission only made real sense in-situ, on the north-west corner of London\u2019s Trafalgar Square. Scale and symbolism have been crucial to this most public of changing artworks. Some have worked better than others, in very different ways. Mark Wallinger\u2019s 1999 Ecce Homo \u2013 a life-sized fake marble figure cast from a real person, set a standard that has been hard to beat. Every new commission has to be more than a thing on a plinth or a joke that gets beaten down by familiarity. Novelty is not enough. The five shortlisted artists for the next two commissions more or less rise to the occasion and reflect the grim sense of foreboding in the national mood. This is no time for celebration. Huma Bhabha\u2019s Untitled figure, with its dark cork body and polystyrene head, has a kind of brutish magnificence and malevolence. But why this? Why here? It seems to me to lack specificity \u2013 calling it Untitled shies away from allusions of any sort and seems to me a lost opportunity. She has made more extreme \u2013 and more fun \u2013 things with a greater sense of absurd horror. Her sculpture seems to belong to the same sculptural universe as Shrigley\u2019s thumb, currently occupying the plinth. It even shares a similar silhouette. Raqs Media Collective\u2019s The Emperor\u2019s Old Clothes is altogether too obvious. There is barely a comment thread below Guardian articles about contemporary art that does not, somewhere, mention the emperor\u2019s new clothes. The robes of an absent emperor, who presumably fled naked from Delhi, leaving only a ceremonial cloak that stands unaided on the plinth, doesn\u2019t say much about anything that we don\u2019t already know. Hans Haacke reduced the equestrian statues occupying the other plinths in the square to a skeletal nag. Raqs\u2019 monument is all clothes but no emperor and no general; an empty relic of the British colonial statues that once populated Delhi now gathered in the city\u2019s Coronation Park. Dami\u00e1n Ortega\u2019s Highway, a sort of unstable circus balancing act with a tall ladder on top of piled-up oil cans on a scaffolding tower built on the flat bed of a lime-green VW truck parked on the plinth, will be much less precarious than it looks. This is a pity. It isn\u2019t knockabout enough, and is too easy a gag. The two projects I would like to see on the plinth are Michael Rakowitz\u2019s The Invisible Enemy Should Not Exist, and Heather Phillipson\u2019s The End. Iraqi-American artist Rakowitz proposes a copy of the winged bull and protective deity Lamassu that once guarded the entrance to the Assyrian Nergal gate of Nineveh, a lost city on the edge of Mosul in Iraq. In 2015, Isis destroyed the ancient sculpture that was kept in the Mosul Museum. Rakowitz\u2019s replica will be made largely from recycled Iraqi date syrup cans, a reminder of a now ruined industry. Rakowitz\u2019s proposal seems to me entirely fitting, a reminder of a lost material culture \u2013 and an abject memorial and a rejoinder to iconoclasm. He makes you stop and think \u2013 reason enough to put his sculpture on the plinth. Phillipson\u2019s The End is a whirl of cream with a cherry on top. She calls it a monument to hubris and impending collapse. When Phillipson recently won the Jarman award, she told me how furious she was. Anger takes the strangest forms. Hers is an exuberant, hollow laugh. The End is the most sculptural sculpture I have seen her make. I am reminded of Claes Oldenburg\u2019s giant cartoonish objects, but Phillipson\u2019s extruded creamy swirl has a giant fly crawling on it and a surveillance drone viciously snagging the air. The whole thing is jammed together as unexpectedly as the vicious and hilarious lines and images in her poems and videos. I can\u2019t wait to see it on the plinth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
