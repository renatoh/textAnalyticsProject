The poster\u2019s aim is to highlight claims that the European referendum is similarly dominated by white men at the top of the political and social ladder. The original photograph featured 10 white immaculately coiffured, smug, white young men dressed in their \u00a31,000 uniforms of blue bow ties, tails and biscuit-coloured waistcoats. The substitutes, similarly attired, are black, white, Chinese, Asian, male and female. One female stand-in on the poster wears a hijab. The figure replacing Cameron, exact in gait and demeanour, is a lanky black man with lengthy dreadlocks. Explaining the rationale behind the ad, OBV\u2019s director, Simon Woolley, said: \u201cWe felt it important to speak out because this referendum and its debate will shape the nation\u2019s future for a generation. It should not be driven by the few, and certainly should not be decided by a minority of small interested parties, even privileged parties. \u201cWe felt the juxtaposition of the infamous image replaced by a snapshot of the UK\u2019s minority communities, in so many ways couldn\u2019t be more stark: the powerful versus the powerless; the constantly heard against the voiceless.\u201d The Bullingdon club was known for hard drinking and bad behaviour. Members were said to have vandalised restaurants and trashed student accommodation. The ad is the second provocative campaign from OBV in recent weeks. An image released last month of an elderly Asian woman being confronted by an aggressive white skinhead was condemned by Brexit campaigners, notably Nigel Farage and Priti Patel, who said it \u201cplumbs new depths in scaremongering\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
