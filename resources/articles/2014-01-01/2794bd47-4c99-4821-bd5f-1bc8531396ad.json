Briar Hill was a single-figure price for the Supreme Novice Hurdle, over the same two-mile trip as Cheltenham's Bumper, as recently as mid-December, but Ruby Walsh's mount needed time and encouragement to pick up the leader Apache Jack in Sunday's contest over two-and-a-half miles. The 1-3 favourite eventually took charge to win by two-and-a-quarter lengths, but Willie Mullins, his trainer, said afterwards that he is unlikely to drop back in trip at the Festival meeting this spring. \"He's improving all the time,\" Mullins said. \"It was a nice performance giving weight away against two good horses, and that probably wouldn't be his preferred ground. \"He's lazy, and Ruby said the minute he passed the winning post he dropped it [the bridle]. He only does enough all the time. \"He'll get an entry in the three races at Cheltenham, but I imagine we'll look at the Neptune or the Albert Bartlett, depending on what other runners we have.\" Briar Hill is top-priced at 14-1 for the Neptune Novice Hurdle, for which Mullins's Faugheen is currently the 8-1 favourite, and also the 7-1 second-favourite for the Albert Bartlett. Southwell will hold an inspection at 7am on Monday morning to determine whether the afternoon's only surviving fixture over jumps can go ahead as planned after several days of persistent rain. \"We had a bit more rain yesterday than was forecast but we'd still race today,\" Roderick Duncan, the track's clerk of the course, said on Sunday. \"There's the possibility of more rain coming overnight and if we got upwards of what is forecast, between 5-10mm, then we'd be under pressure.\" Chepstow's planned meeting on Tuesday has already been abandoned, while the card at Leicester the same afternoon is subject to an inspection at 8am on Monday. As a result, there could be no jumps racing in Britain until Wednesday, when Doncaster is due to stage a seven-race card. Ludlow's fixture the same afternoon is already in doubt, while Huntingdon, which is due to race on Friday, is currently flooded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
