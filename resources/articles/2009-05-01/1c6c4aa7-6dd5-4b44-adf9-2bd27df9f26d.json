The favourite to win July's presidential elections at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u appears to be cooling on signing the Manchester United winger. P\u00e9rez remains prepared to return to Ronaldo should other options break down but his primary targets lie elsewhere, with Kaka and Franck Rib\u00e9ry at the head of a list of preferred signings that also includes Xabi Alonso and David Villa. The Guardian reported in April that Ronaldo's representatives had struck a deal with the then Madrid president Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n to bring the Portugal international to the Bernab\u00e9u. But Calder\u00f3n was ousted following a vote-rigging scandal and the deal would not be legally binding for the incoming president. P\u00e9rez need not fear repercussions if he did not follow through on Calder\u00f3n's promise to sign Ronaldo because the deal \u2013 struck between Calder\u00f3n on behalf of Madrid and Jorge Mendes on behalf of Ronaldo without the agreement of United \u2013 would contravene Fifa transfer regulations and have no legal basis. At his unveiling as a presidential candidate last week, P\u00e9rez announced that he would have to \"do in one year what would normally be done in three\". He is keen to make more than one marquee signing and believes the amount likely to be needed to prise Ronaldo from Old Trafford is prohibitive. Calder\u00f3n briefed that he could sign the winger for about \u00a480-100m (\u00a370-88m) and, desperate to add a star name, was prepared to commit a season's budget to just one signing. P\u00e9rez is not. Doubts also remain about United's willingness to sell. Despite his silence on specific targets, P\u00e9rez has made great play of the close relationship he enjoys with Milan's vice-president Adriano Galliani. No such link exists with United. MIlan's Kaka is an attractive, cheaper and more accessible proposition for the latest Madrid gal\u00e1ctico, who would allow for resources to be directed towards other players. Reports in the Spanish press that P\u00e9rez had been unimpressed with Ronaldo's strop after being substituted against Manchester City 11 days ago can be read as a smokescreen, a timely excuse. Although P\u00e9rez wants to sign star players, he has been persuaded by his future director general, Jorge Valdano, and Zinedine Zidane, who looks likely to play a role within the sporting directorate, of the need to strengthen elsewhere. Zidane has been outspoken in his desire to see his compatriot Rib\u00e9ry, the Bayern Munich forward who is wanted by Manchester United, at the Bernab\u00e9u; Valdano is particularly keen on signing Alonso, the Liverpool midfielder. Both Rafael Ben\u00edtez and Alonso have recently insisted there are no plans for the 27-year-old to leave, and the club yesterday said he was \"not for sale\", but the Liverpool manager may be receptive to an offer in the region of the \u00a318m he wanted for Alonso last summer. Signing Kaka would offer another significant political advantage: his arrival would flag up a new era at the club and lay bare the difference between the discredited Calder\u00f3n and P\u00e9rez. Kaka is the player Calder\u00f3n promised to sign but never did. Buying Ronaldo would send a rather more ambiguous message. Calder\u00f3n reiterated his claim to have struck a deal with Ronaldo even after he had been ousted from the presidency, insisting that his successor could execute the deal. The point he was trying to make was clear: even if Ronaldo joins a club whose president is P\u00e9rez, I was the man that brought him to Madrid. P\u00e9rez does not want to be seen to endorse Calder\u00f3n's deal, nor does he wish to have a player even vaguely seen as Calder\u00f3n's signing. In part, it is that rationale that has made P\u00e9rez keen to find a buyer for Arjen Robben, whose signing was the one presidential promise Calder\u00f3n delivered, after failing with Kaka and Arsenal's Cesc F\u00e1bregas. P\u00e9rez, having based much of his return on the claim that it is time to bring \"ethics\" and \"honesty\" back to Madrid after three turbulent years under Calder\u00f3n, does not want to make a promise that he cannot then keep. So far he has remained tight-lipped over signings but strategic leaks to the Spanish media have been used to gauge the opinions of fans and to prepare the ground for future announcements. P\u00e9rez's project, starting with his sporting director, coach and at least one signing, is expected to be unveiled next week.
