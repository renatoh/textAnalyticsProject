But he still had every right to expect more from those players who have been on the margins of the club's rise to the Premier League summit and who were given an opportunity in this semi-final first leg. Adam Johnson, Nigel de Jong and Stefan Savic failed to impress against Kenny Dalglish's well-drilled, relentless Liverpool team, and while there were mitigating factors for Savic, a 21-year-old central defender, the England and Holland internationals had no excuses. The onus was on Johnson to provide the creative spark for City in David Silva's absence with an ankle injury, and more so once Mario Balotelli hobbled off in the first half, but he never had the beating of Glen Johnson on either the left or the right. De Jong never made his bulky presence felt in central midfield. 2 Reina was a man on a mission for Liverpool Dalglish overindulged in excuses for last week's 3-0 reverse at the Etihad Stadium when suggesting there was something amiss with the ball that deceived Jos\u00e9 Reina when Sergio Ag\u00fcero opened the scoring. He really didn't need to protect a goalkeeper of Reina's quality, who is a player who subjects himself to the fiercest self-criticism. Reina knew full well he had erred and made amends at the earliest opportunity against City. There were no breathtaking saves from the Liverpool keeper but his commanding performance was instrumental in protecting his side's slender lead. He refused to commit and therefore stymied Ag\u00fcero as he latched on to Martin Kelly's poor back-pass; saved well from a Micah Richards header at close range; and beat Gareth Barry to a dangerous cross at the front post late on. 3 There are no ifs or maybes about Kompany's value The City captain, Vincent Kompany, issued a reasoned and intelligent argument against his four-match suspension on Facebook yesterday and, regardless of the interpretations of his tackle on Nani on Sunday, there is no question that the loss of Kompany for the two legs of the semi-final and league games against Wigan and Tottenham leaves a huge void even for a manager of Mancini's resources. The performance of his replacement, Savic, merely reinforced City's sense of loss. Mancini could have moved Richards into central defence and fielded Pablo Zabaleta at right-back but he chose to hand a seventh start of the season to the \u00a36m signing from Partizan Belgrade. A lack of sharpness and conviction was evident in the Montenegro international from the start, as Andy Carroll brushed him aside for a shot. Then Savic raked Agger's knee to concede the penalty. Poor passes and headers compounded his costly performance for a team that cannot carry a player finding his way into the English game. 4 Is Andy Carroll even worth \u00a310m? The price placed on Carroll's head in some quarters regarding a mooted return to Newcastle United appears exorbitant on the evidence of his mediocre Liverpool career so far. Given that it is only 12 months since Dalglish paid \u00a335m for the centre-forward, however, \u00a310m is a complete non-starter unless a few of Newcastle's prized assets are thrown into the deal. Either way, and without a burning desire on Carroll's part to head back home, the uncertainty over his future is not going to assist the England player in his efforts to prove himself worthy of a place at Anfield and at Euro 2012. Carroll's confidence is clearly low and with Liverpool deep and compact following Gerrard's penalty, he was often 20 or 30 yards from his nearest team-mate in a true lone striker's role. That said, and for the second successive game against City, Carroll suggested he does have a contribution to make. He engineered two good chances for himself and offered greater movement that he has shown of late. There is still a long way to go, of course. 5 Global domination begins at home The Carling Cup may not be a priority for City but it was still surprising to see so many empty seats in the home sections of the Etihad Stadium. Sunday's FA Cup \"moral victory\" or, as everyone outside City would put it, defeat by Manchester United has left only one route to Wembley this season and with Championship opposition guaranteed for the final, a full house might have been expected for a semi-final at home to Liverpool. Maybe it was the inevitable consequences of the festive season, but almost 47,000 were present against United. Or perhaps, with this City's third semi-final in the past three years and the Premier League title now a real aim, there was an element of taking the good times for granted. Not at City, surely?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
