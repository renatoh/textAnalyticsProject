While he will forever be remembered as the man who finally nailed the Kray twins, a major factor in his enduring reputation was that he was regarded with great affection, not only by his colleagues but by many in the criminal fraternity, who regarded him as a straight arrow in an era when some of his fellow detectives were far from that ideal. Long after his retirement, Read was happy to reminisce about his work, and did not seem to mind being asked the same endless questions about the Krays. At the start of his investigation into the twins, in the mid-sixties, he had been astonished at the aura that surrounded them. \u201cIf they drove down Commercial Road [in east London] everyone waved to them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody had a drink with them, it was like having tea with Princess Margaret.\u201d As an undercover officer, he remembered his first sighting, in 1964, of Ronnie Kray at the Grave Maurice, the Whitechapel pub the twins frequented. \u201cThere was a big American car and a guy stepped out with his hand in his pocket as though he had a gun there and sort of swept the street, making sure there was no one in sight and then gave a signal and the back door opened and out stepped Ronnie Kray. \u201cHe was dressed like a 1930s Chicago gangster, with a long, long cashmere coat that reached to his ankles, tied in a loose belt at the waist. His hair was greased and parted and he wore his glasses. He looked like Al Capone without his fedora.\u201d Read, a sunny, good-natured and modest character who did not take himself too seriously, only rarely bristled when asked about the Krays in later life. The former Daily Telegraph crime correspondent, John Weeks, recalled that \u201cthe only time I saw him get annoyed was when I asked him about [the Krays] doing good for OAPs, taking them to the seaside in charabancs. He said \u2018that\u2019s the biggest load of crap. They did nothing at all\u2019.\u201d His former Scotland Yard colleagues regarded Read with admiration. John Grieve, the former deputy assistant commissioner who headed the anti-terrorist and racial crime units at the Met, joined the police at the time Read was hunting the Krays, and recalls him as \u201can absolute inspiration to my generation, a paradigm of what a dedicated detective should be in the latter half of the twentieth century: innovative, meticulous, hardworking, a successful investigator of massive integrity and high professional expertise. Put the fear of God and New Scotland Yard into the bad guys.\u201d Read had been given the responsibility by Scotland Yard of tackling the twins after Jack \u201cThe Hat\u201d McVitie\u2019s murder in 1967, at a time when they seemed untouchable, and he set off in pursuit of those who had drifted out of the gang. His key informant was Leslie Payne, who had handled the Krays\u2019 business affairs and now believed they wanted him dead. The Krays seemed to have taken the news of the pursuit phlegmatically: they bought two boa constrictors and named them Read and Gerrard after the two men tracking them, \u201cNipper\u201d and Ch Supt Fred Gerrard. Payne\u2019s evidence was vital in convicting both men. Read believed at the time that his inquiry was hampered by the early leaking of his work by the \u201cmandarins\u201d at Scotland Yard, who liked to boast of corporate successes. He also heard that there was a contract on his life and started looking under his car before setting off for work. Years later, Read would argue that Payne was, in effect, the first \u201csupergrass\u201d, the title often given to Bertie Smalls, who informed in the 1970s on dozens of former bank-robbing associates. When Ronnie Kray died in 1995, Read said he was \u201csaddened\u201d by the news \u2013 and he probably meant it. This article was amended on 9 April 2020 to correct the date of Ronnie Kray\u2019s death"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
