But what started as a wheeze hatched on the freezing football terraces to publicise Hartlepool FC's mascot ended in a political career that lasted as long as Tony Blair's. It is now, alas, coming to an end, after voters in the town backed a referendum to scrap the post of mayor. Back in 2002, no one was more shocked to get 603 votes more than Labour than the man in the monkey suit, Stuart Drummond, a credit controller in a call centre. But he threw himself into the job \u2013 it was, he said, like doing six master's degrees in six months \u2013 and, after being re-elected twice, now looks very much the part. Irony upon irony for the anti-politics mayor, Drummond said he was disappointed by the low turnout but he remains philosophical about the outcome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
