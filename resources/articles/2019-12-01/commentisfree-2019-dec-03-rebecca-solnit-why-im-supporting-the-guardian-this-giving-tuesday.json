In the film, we get to see how bleak the town and many individual lives in it would be had the protagonist never been born. In the current world climate, it\u2019s easy to imagine how much bleaker the political landscape would be were the Guardian not hard at work on so many fronts. Without the Guardian there would be a huge hole in our understanding of the world, a terrible lack in the information available to us. How the news is reported shapes the news, and the Guardian\u2019s fierce candor about corruption, destruction and brutality \u2013 so often described elsewhere only in euphemisms \u2013 matters. The Guardian is not burdened by the fictions of \u201cboth-sides\u201d-ism; it\u2019s confidently committed to human rights, democracy and the environment. In 1921, on the centennial of the paper\u2019s founding, its editor in chief wrote, \u201cOne of the virtues, perhaps almost the chief virtue, of a newspaper is its independence,\u201d and the Guardian remains perhaps the most independent of major English-language newspapers \u2013 not swayed by wealthy owners or advertisers, not deferential to political authority, ferocious in its exposure of corporate corruption. As an American, I have turned to the Guardian since 9/11 for a view of geopolitics uncluttered by the conventions and deference to status quo that afflict most US media. As a climate activist I\u2019ve been grateful for the only major newspaper to give the climate emergency the attention it needs \u2013 big front-page stories, the amplification of climate voices such as Greta Thunberg and Naomi Klein, and on-the-ground coverage of the Standing Rock protests. As a writer, I\u2019ve been thrilled to see the Guardian make bold decisions about the implicit bias in language, such as rejecting the anti-choice movement\u2019s propaganda term \u201cfetal heartbeats\u201d for embryos who are not fetuses and have not developed hearts, to replacing the term \u201cclimate change\u201d with the more appropriate \u201cclimate crisis\u201d. As a resident of the outskirts of Silicon Valley, I\u2019ve also been grateful for the unsparing reporting and analysis on the tech industry by reporters like Julia Carrie Wong and Guardian contributors like Siva Vaidhyanathan and Veena Dubal. In 2013, the Guardian journalist Ewen MacAskill was part of the first team reporting on Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about the NSA\u2019s vast surveillance operations on ordinary people. The Guardian\u2019s sister publication, the Observer, broke the story of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s shady dealings with Facebook data. Subtract all this and we have a lot less oversight of, and insight into, what the powerful are doing. We are less equipped as citizens to exercise our own power on behalf of the vulnerable and in defense of a livable future. The Guardian supports our power and our future, which is why I\u2019m arguing for returning the favor. It\u2019s a wonderful newspaper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
