Dom Rotheroe's suburban drama My Brother Tom is stylistically sober and firmly rooted in the present, while Andrew K\u00f6tting's This Filthy Earth is a deliberately timeless and stylised impression of rural life, a surrealist romp without a definite sense of place or period. Yet, to differing degrees, both films signal a break with the past for British cinema. The directors belong to a small but impressive group of young British film-makers, from Lynne Ramsay (Ratcatcher) to Shane Meadows (TwentyFourSeven, A Room for Romeo Brass) to Ben Hopkins (Nine Lives of Tomas Katz), who dare to break with narrative traditions, embrace new technologies and - most encouragingly - do not make films that are self-consciously 'British', whether those films are televisual kitchen sink dramas or well-dressed crime capers. Of these two new films, the most original is This Filthy Earth, K\u00f6tting's follow-up to Gallivant, his 1996 documentary of the journey he made around the coastline of Britain with his elderly grandmother and mentally handicapped daughter. A loose impression of Emile Zola's La Terre, This Filthy Earth is set in a small, incestuous village resembling northern England at some time in the past few decades. This intensely lyrical film revolves around two peasant sisters, Francine (Rebecca Palmer) and Kath (Demelza Randall), and in this remote hamlet, man and beast live cheek by jowl, survival being the strongest instinct. In This Filthy Earth, K\u00f6tting toys with time and place: he introduces strange dance music into a wedding scene and depicts a major flood with old and grainy black-and-white archive footage of an angry, swollen river. This is not social realism, at least in the traditional sense. 'There'll be purists out there saying, \"But she's got a Lancashire accent and she's got a Yorkshire accent,\"' K\u00f6tting explains, 'but within three or four minutes of the film opening you're sucked into this world which is pertinent to itself. Any ideas you might have about when this is set, or where this is, are blown out of the water when you get to the wedding scene and a big piece of dub [reggae] comes crashing in and you think, \"What kind of music is that?\"' Tellingly, K\u00f6tting came to film in the early Eighties through fine art, first picking up a camera to capture the outdoor performance pieces he was doing with his partner. Through a number of celebrated short films, including Hoi Polloi (1990) and Smart Alek (1993), K\u00f6tting developed the same approach that he uses in This Filthy Earth, mixing film and video formats, playing with speed and sculpting with sound. K\u00f6tting's cinema is unreservedly experimental. 'Cinema is a visual language,' he explains. 'Why not remove some of the image and just allow the sound to work for a while? Why not write the sound so large, or make it so incongruous, that it transports you to somewhere else? 'What I'm trying to do is transport an audience to a place cinematically where possibly they've never been before.' Just as K\u00f6tting's unique style comes from a background in fine art rather than cinema ('I found myself slowly becoming more interested in the process of making the film than I was in just the performance itself; I still wouldn't think of myself as a feature-film-maker, I'm just making longer pieces of work'), Dom Rotheroe's experience lies mainly in documentaries. He made A Sarajevo Diary for Channel 4 and also Shadows on the Street, a film tracking a group of street kids in Rio. Rotheroe's decision to use handheld digital video gives My Brother Tom a documentary edge, allowing him to get close to actors and achieve an unusual intimacy in this film, which follows the secret and intense relationship between two alienated and abused teenagers in a comfortable Home Counties suburb. The result looks like a Dogme film, which is not surprising considering that the film's cinematographer, Robby M\u00fcller, has also worked with Danish director Lars von Trier (The Idiots, Dancer In The Dark). 'Some of the film is completely improvised, like when they're running about in the woods,' explains Rotheroe of the effect of using a digital camera. 'When running up to a scene, we sometimes had three or four minutes of improvisation with the camera on, and then I was running scenes all the way through to keep the pace up, and shooting it from all different angles.' Both This Filthy Earth and My Brother Tom hail the true arrival of digital film in British cinema. In My Brother Tom it's the only format used, lending a film about relationships a heightened realism, just as the Dogme directors Thomas Vinterberg and von Trier respectively achieved with Festen and The Idiots . In This Filthy Earth it's an experimental device, another layer of colour with which to tell a story. The influence of Dogme in My Brother Tom is a nod to another positive movement in independent British film: the will to look to foreign-language cinema for inspiration. It's no coincidence that Ben (Simon Magus) Hopkins's second feature, the impressive The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz - a surreal portrait of the apocalypse in which one actor moves through nine different characters - had a lukewarm response from British audiences but then went on to achieve surprise success in Germany: Hopkins admits that he has being strongly influenced by German expressionist film-makers. The fate of The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz highlights a stumbling block to this flourishing of experiment and daring: the conservative nature of British film distributors and audiences. It is not easy to get films like these made. 'Everything in British cinema - especially mainstream, narrative cinema - is loaded against experiment,' K\u00f6tting offers. 'It's seen as anti-narrative, as getting in the way of the story, and ends up being described as whimsical or quirky or gratuitous.' This Filthy Earth and My Brother Tom stand out for their innovations, but scratch beneath the surface and a line can be traced. In British cinema, social realism has often come to mean, the films of older directors such as Mike Leigh and Ken Loach, film-makers whose work have origins in Sixties television and theatre, or 'serious' comedies, focusing on the working class and softened by the distance of the past, such as Billy Elliot, Brassed Off or even The Full Monty. But below the unique style of This Filthy Earth lie themes of immigration, of rural poverty and of conflicts within communities that currently resonate. Similarly, My Brother Tom provides an acute - if sometimes overstated - portrait both of suburban middle-class life and of the overbearing influence religion (in this case Catholicism) can have on the lives of young people trying to find themselves. Experiment and daring need be seen not as a break with the British tradition of social realism, but as a progression of it, an embrace of new ways of looking at ourselves and telling our stories. This Filthy Earth opens on 2 November; My Brother Tom on 16 November The names to watch Andrew Kotting (This Filthy Earth) Starting in the mid-1980s, K\u00f6tting developed an experimental style through short films before making his first feature, Gallivant, in 1996. He still regularly makes shorts and is currently working with a neuro-physiologist on Mapping Perception, a science, film and art project inspired by his daughter, Eden, who has a rare genetic condition called Joubert's syndrome. Dom Rotheroe (My Brother Tom) Originally a documentary-maker, Rotheroe made A Sarajevo Diary (1993) about the Bosnian war soon after completing a photography, film and video course in London. He won a Bafta nomination for the film and went on to make further documentaries on the war in East Timor and the plight of homeless children in Brazil. Ben Hopkins (The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz) Hopkins won 14 awards internationally for his 1995 Royal College of Art graduate film, National Achievement Day , and went on to make two esoteric feature films in two years - Simon Magus (1999) and The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz (2000). The first is a mystical tale of anti-Semitism in nineteenth-century Poland; the second is a surreal tale of the apocalypse coming to London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
