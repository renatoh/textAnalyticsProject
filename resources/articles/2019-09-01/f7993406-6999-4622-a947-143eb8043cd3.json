Thanks for reading Clockwatch! Nick Ames was at the Emirates to see Gabriel Martinelli introduce himself in style. Everton eased past Sheffield Wednesday, to keep their dream of a first trophy since 1995 alive. Liz Byrnes was on hand to witness a good evening for Dominic Calvert-Lewin. More on that south-coast derby, courtesy of Ben Fisher at Fratton Park. Paul Wilson was at Deepdale to see Raheem Sterling run riot. A word on the south-coast derby from Danny Ings (who supported Southampton as a kid) and James Ward-Prowse (a Portsmouth fan as a lad). \u201cIt\u2019s a derby that I have always wanted to play in,\u201d says Ings. \u201cI\u2019ve been very fortunate to play in other derbies but this one tops it off for me. Obviously a great night, great for the fans and a fantastic win.\u201d Ward-Prowse adds: \u201cIt was a special occasion, great for the area. I think both sets of fans have been looking forward to this. These are the games as players you want to play in. We knew what we had to do and we did a fantastic job. We came here to do a job and we are in the hat for the next round, that\u2019s what we will be celebrating on the way home.\u201d All the full-time scores. Arsenal 5-0 Nottingham Forest Colchester United 0-0 Tottenham Hotspur (Colchester win 4-3 on pens) Crawley Town 1-1 Stoke City (Crawley win 5-3 on pens) Luton Town 0-4 Leicester City Portsmouth 0-4 Southampton Preston North End 0-3 Manchester City Sheffield Wednesday 0-2 Everton Watford 2-1 Swansea City Quite a contrast in emotions in north London tonight. For the second successive round, Crawley have seen off a Championship side! Stoke follow Leeds, and it\u2019s officially crisis time in the Potteries. Martinelli has announced himself tonight. He\u2019s already got one. Now he\u2019s curled a vicious shot into the top right from 25 yards. This is now a rout. We could have another shock on our hands! Sam Vokes has missed Stoke\u2019s first penalty in the shootout with Crawley. After a couple of spot-kicks each, it\u2019s 2-1 to the League Two club ... and the pressure is on struggling Stoke City! As if Tottenham\u2019s night wasn\u2019t bad enough. Lapslie slams home ... and the 2008 winners are out! The Champions League finalists have been knocked out by a side from League Two! Fans flood onto the pitch in celebration! Spurs have gone the same way as Crystal Palace, who were defeated on penalties in the second round. It\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s first defeat as Spurs boss to a club from the lower leagues! And now it\u2019s 3-3 after four spot kicks each. Lucas Moura, the hero of the Champions League semi final against Ajax, stutters his run-up and clips Tottenham\u2019s fifth penalty off the top of the crossbar. Tom Lapslie will have a penalty to win it for Colchester! ... it\u2019s level between Spurs and Colchester after three penalties each. It\u2019s 2-2. Christian Eriksen missed the first one for Spurs. Then Jevani Brown tried a Panenka. It was such a weak effort, Paulo Gazzaniga, having dived, was able to spring back up and punch the ball away, livid at his opponent\u2019s cheek! What drama! A second match is going to penalties. Speaking of which ... Southampton\u2019s first win in a south-coast derby since 2005. And it\u2019s a big one. The perfect way to bounce back from an eight-goal defeat. Much relief for Marco Silva. Wednesday can\u2019t avenge defeat in the 1966 FA Cup final. The three-time winners breeze through, and Leicester\u2019s fine start to the season continues apace. Joe Willock makes it certain for the Gunners. Another corner, a bit of pinball, and Willock slots it home from eight yards. Another memorable performance from Raheem Sterling, and the holders are into the fourth round. The League Two side have taken last year\u2019s Champions League finalists to penalties! Kelechi Iheanacho is sent clear down the left and chips the keeper. A delightful - and rare - goal for the Foxes striker. Corner. A simple header from close range for Rob Holding. The four-time winners Forest are heading out. Pompey gave as good as they got in the first half, but they\u2019ve eventually been outclassed. And Nathan Redmond has scored the goal of the game, whizzing down the left, drifting inside, and launching a sweet shot into the bottom left. A night to forget for Pompey ... though of course Saints fans will remind them of this scoreline at every possible opportunity. Gerard Deulofeu scampers down the left, draws a few Swansea defenders, then slips a ball across the face of goal, allowing Roberto Pereyra to clip home from close range. It\u2019s all over at Kenilworth Road as well. Kelechi Iheanacho should score upon barging clear, but stumbles as he tries to round the keeper. No matter! He at least keeps the move going, and the ball\u2019s looped to the left for Youri Tielemans, who races into the box and whistles a volley home. Cedric has won the derby for Saints. Well, he\u2019s the scorer, though it\u2019s Danny Ings who has really done the business. Ings has already scored two; now he\u2019s scampered down the left and reached the byline, the ball breaking back for Cedric, who slams home. This will be Southampton\u2019s first win over the old enemy since 2005. Goals please. Please. Aw come on. A reminder that any games drawn after 90 minutes go straight to penalties. With this in mind, Spurs - no trophy since winning this competition in 2008, remember - throw on Erik Lamela as well. Not so long to grind out the win against League Two Colchester. The irrepressible Raheem Sterling nearly sets up another goal for Manchester City at Deepdale. He skates down the middle of the park and flicks the ball to Phil Foden on his right. Foden bashes a shot off the crossbar. But still no second-half goal in any of these third-round games. Sterling, though. What a star. Collins comes sliding straight through the back of AN Opponent at high speed. It\u2019s comically reckless, utterly needless, and struggling Stoke are up against it now. Dear me. What pointless hoodlummery. Tottenham are still looking to crack the Colchester code. Last season\u2019s Champions League runners-up are frustrated enough against the League Two side to have just brought on Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-min. Goals, please. Please. Preston hit the post against champions Manchester City! Josh Harrop sashays in from the right, leans back, and whips a low shot off the bottom of the right-hand post. On another night, the former Manchester United player could have had a couple of goals for the hosts. The slim margins between a thriller and a thrashing. Some more close misses. Sam Surridge fails to bundle a high ball across the line for Swansea at Watford; it\u2019s quite astonishing that he didn\u2019t connect. Meanwhile Kyle Walker-Peters nearly opens the scoring for Spurs at Colchester, lashing in a cross from the right that evades everyone and comes off the left-hand upright! But no second-half goals to report yet. It\u2019s end to end at Crawley. Ollie Palmer should have given the hosts the lead over Stoke, sent clear by a poor defensive backflick. But he didn\u2019t have the pace to reach the area, then went over too easily looking for a penalty. He didn\u2019t get it. Then Stoke went up the other end, Jordan Cousins slamming home from close range ... but from an offside position. We\u2019re into the second half in seven League Cup matches around the country. Meanwhile it\u2019s just gone half-time at the Emirates, where Arsenal go in 1-0 ahead of Forest. Half-time entertainment. Colchester 0-0 Tottenham Crawley 1-1 Stoke Luton 0-2 Leicester Portsmouth 0-2 Southampton Preston 0-3 Manchester City Sheffield Wednesday 0-2 Everton Watford 1-1 Swansea They\u2019re still playing at the Emirates, where the game kicked off at 8pm. It\u2019s currently 1-0 to the Gunners against Forest. This is a peach of a goal, a PlayStation special. Reiss Nelson sprays a pass wide right to Calum Chambers, who volleys a first-time cross towards Martinelli at the near post. Martinelli twists in mid air to slam home. Portsmouth were pressing again. And again they\u2019re caught on the break. Danny Ings is sent scampering clear down the middle and he dinks a gorgeous chip over the keeper and into the net. Saints in control at the break. James Justin scores against his old club, gliding in from the right to meet a dropping diagonal pass and slamming home elegantly. He doesn\u2019t celebrate, and his old fans sportingly applaud their former player. Sterling just can\u2019t stop it. Now he\u2019s barrelling down the left, slipping a perfectly weighted pass into the box for David Silva, whose shot from a tight angle on the left is deflected past the keeper by Ryan Ledson. \u201cThe Man City kit looks like a few Bar\u00e7a away kits have run together in the wash,\u201d opines Gerard Nugent. Pep\u2019s influence runs deep. Misery descends on Stoke again. Nathan Ferguson fails to connect with a cute backheel, a low ball flying into the Stoke box from the right. But no matter! The ball sits up for him anyway, and he\u2019s able to whip it home. This is hardly breaking news, but Raheem Sterling is such a fine player. Now he\u2019s setting them up, slipping in Gabriel Jesus after causing all manner of hassle down the inside-left channel. Sterling is simply unplayable in this mood. Watford\u2019s respite didn\u2019t last long. Sam Surridge, on loan from Bournemouth, levels it up at Vicarage Road, sliding in to meet Nathan Dyer\u2019s right-wing cross. It\u2019s his fourth goal of the season. A cute corner from Marc Albrighton, clipped to the near post and flicked back to Demarai Gray, who bundles a shot into the bottom left. Luton were caught snoozing. One straight out of Brendan Rodgers playbook. The manager will be well chuffed with that. On the subject of much needed respite, here\u2019s some for injury-plagued Danny Welbeck and recently-shellacked Watford. The striker plants a header home at a corner, and it\u2019s his first goal since last October. Bagatelle at a corner, and Sam Vokes slams home from close range. Some much needed respite for under-pressure Supremes earworm Nathan Jones. Against the run of play, Saints have taken the lead at Fratton. Danny Ings shoots from the edge of the box, and the Premier League club take the lead. He very nearly makes it 2-0 a few seconds after, but can\u2019t quite chip MacGillivray in the Pompey goal. Sweet baby Moses, have you seen what Manchester City are wearing this evening? They\u2019re decked out like a packet of sweets from the 1970s. Hey, does anybody remember sweets that wouldn\u2019t pass EU regulations these days, etc. A proper envelope-pushing comedian could get a whole bit out of that. Anyway, their psychedelic gear has got Preston spinning, because Raheem Sterling has just run at them with great pace and skill, swerving this way and that before banging a shot home from just inside the box. What a run that is! League One Portsmouth are giving a good account of themselves against Premier League Southampton. John Marquis has just barged his way down the right and thumped a long-range effort off the outside of the right-hand post. Not at all sure Alex McCarthy would have got to that, had it been on target. McCarthy does get his fingers to Brett Pittman\u2019s rising screamer a few minutes later, though. Great save. Pompey on top. What a start for under-fire Marco Silva ... and for Dominic Calvert-Lewin. He\u2019s just poked in Alex Iwobi\u2019s left-wing cross. Wednesday will take heart that they were 2-0 up in the 1966 FA Cup final against Everton, only to end up losing 3-2. Er, sort of. Spectacular cup turnarounds between these two sides have historical precedent, is all we\u2019re saying. This is a fine goal, and it\u2019s come against the early run of play. Wednesday had been on the front foot, but Dominic Calvert-Lewin was picked out down the inside-left channel, he romped into the area, and thumped an unstoppable shot into the roof of the net! No early goals. Though there was very nearly a shock start at Deepdale, where Josh Harrop - formerly of Manchester United - couldn\u2019t quite get a close-range header on target for Preston. Now that would have put the cat among the treble-winning pigeons. All the matches, save the one at the Emirates, have just kicked off. Here\u2019s the weather at Fratton Park, incidentally. Summer\u2019s gone. Autumn\u2019s here! Arsenal versus Nottingham Forest has been delayed by 15 minutes due to the entire country\u2019s transport infrastructure being totally jiggered. Re-nationalise the railways! Vote Labour! We paraphrase of course. The official club line is \u201ctravel issues for supporters\u201d. However you spin it, that match will now kick off at 8pm.
