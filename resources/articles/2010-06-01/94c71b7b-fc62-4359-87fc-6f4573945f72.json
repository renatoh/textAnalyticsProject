We begin by analysing the best of the action from Cameroon's defeat to Denmark, which saw the Indomitable Lions become the first team out of the tournament. Will you miss them? From there, we hear from ESPN.com's Leander Schaerlaeckens about Holland's victory over Japan, and then gloss pretty quickly over Ghana-Australia. Next, we reflect further on England's abject outing against Algeria. It's not all Emile Heskey's fault, is it? Graeme Souness reckons it's about altitude, but then, he is a doctor. Or not. Finally, we hear from Fernando Duarte about Brazil's game with Ivory Coast as we preview all of tomorrow's games, and ask, slightly tangentially, can chickens blink? Tweet us here, post your thoughts below, and see you tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
