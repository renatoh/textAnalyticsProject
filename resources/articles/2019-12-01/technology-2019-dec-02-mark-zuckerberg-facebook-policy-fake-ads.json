Challenged on CBS over the policy, which has raised concerns over misinformation campaigns that could distort elections, Zuckerberg refused to commit to any changes. \u201cWhat I believe is that in a democracy, it\u2019s really important that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying, so they can make their own judgments,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, you know, I don\u2019t think that a private company should be censoring politicians or news.\u201d Gayle King, co-host of CBS This Morning, pointed out that 200 Facebook employees wrote a letter asking Zuckerberg to reconsider as \u201cfree speech and paid speech are not the same\u201d. The Facebook co-founder was unmoved. \u201cWell, this is a clearly a very complex issue, and a lot of people have a lot of different opinions,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I just think that in a democracy, people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.\u201d He added: \u201cI think that people should be able to judge for themselves the character of politicians.\u201d Zuckerberg has come under criticism from lawmakers including New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who have warned that the 2020 presidential election will be influenced by paid-for false claims spread by the social media platform. Similar fears have played out in the UK ahead of its general election this month. Facebook removed an ad by the Conservatives that showed BBC reporters seemingly decrying a \u201cpointless delay to Brexit\u201d \u2013 in fact the reporters were quoting politicians including prime minister Boris Johnson. The BBC asked the Tories to take the ad down, only to be rebuffed. Facebook acquiesced, however, due to \u201cintellectual property\u201d concerns. Facebook\u2019s outsized role in funnelling false claims and fake news stories to voters has been highlighted since the election of Donald Trump as US president. The company has been accused of giving a mainstream platform to extremist groups, with Guardian US recently reporting how two white nationalist organizations continued to operate Facebook pages months after a promised ban. On CBS, King asked Zuckerberg about a meeting with Trump at the White House in October. Trump has previously said Facebook shouldn\u2019t ban political ads. Zuckerberg said: \u201cWe talked about a number of things that were on his mind. And some of the topics that you\u2019d read about in the news around our work.\u201d Asked if Trump lobbied him, Zuckerberg said: \u201cNo. I mean, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s \u2026 I think some of the stuff that people talk about or think gets discussed [in] these discussions are not really how that works. \u201cI also want to respect that it was a private dinner and \u2026 private discussion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
