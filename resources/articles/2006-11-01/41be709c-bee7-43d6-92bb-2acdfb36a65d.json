It depends on who you listen to. \"Ofcom have absolutely failed to deliver ... Whilst Ofcom stalls, the obesity epidemic weighing down our children's health continues to grow,\" says the British Heart Foundation. Meanwhile, the government's children's commissioner declares that: \"Children have been sold out in the interests of profit.\" On the other side, Ofcom is accused of \"moving the goalposts\" and retreating from evidence-based regulation. The advertising trade body IPA said Ofcom's proposals were \"totally disproportionate\" and \"scientifically flawed\". No doubt in some part of Ofcom's collective brain, the fact they are being so vehemently attacked by both sides will be taken as evidence they have got something right. However, there is no doubt that for Ofcom this has been tough and if the health campaigners get their way it's not over yet. The problem stems from the relative paucity of evidence that television advertising has much effect on children's food choices. Back in 2004, Ofcom commissioned Professor Sonia Livingston to review the available research. She concluded that childhood obesity was caused by multiple factors, including environment and culture, and that the role of food promotion on TV was not well understood. Experimental evidence suggested that just 2% of all children's food choices were influenced by TV advertising and that other factors - most notably the sedentary nature of watching TV - might have considerably greater impact on the problem of childhood obesity. Nevertheless, Ofcom concluded there was sufficient evidence to justify some form of intervention to reduce children's exposure to the advertising of foods high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) but nowhere near enough to justify an outright ban. In other words, a total ban would not on its own solve childhood obesity, or even make a significant impact on the problem. Instead, it would threaten the commercial underpinning of much children's programme production and even risk crippling some children's TV services. As a consequence, the guiding principle of Ofcom's approach has been proportionality. And from that point on, the regulator has found itself firmly in the realm of politics. Ofcom has taken on board the argument that since children do not only watch programmes made specifcally for them, restrictions should apply to some adult-focused output. But the formula that Ofcom uses to define which programmes should be shielded from junk-food ads - programmes watched by 20% more children under 16 than the national average - would appear to be at odds with the underlying rationale for intervention in the first place. In other words, it is theoretically possible for a programme with a very big audience (say a big ITV soap) to be watched by large numbers of children but not sufficient to trigger the restrictions. Therefore, the logical solution would be to trigger the measures by the total number of child viewers, rather than an arbitrary proportion. But that could result in a total ban on HFSS advertising before 9pm, which would, in Ofcom's view, be too onerous, given the relatively modest effect of TV advertising on children's behaviour in the first place. Childhood obesity is no doubt one of the most serious challenges our society faces. But banning food advertising to children can only ever be a very small part of the solution. By comparison with social and economic deprivation, schools without playing fields and car culture, TV is an easy target. In the meantime, we had better hope that Ofcom can hold its line in the cause of proportionality and evidence-based regulation, otherwise some important programmes risk becoming needless victims of politics. What is the benefit of the BBC bill? Barely noticed in the Queen's speech last week was the proposal to pass a bill allowing the BBC access to the nation's pension and benefit records to see who is eligible for targeted help with the digital switchover. The initial idea that the BBC licence fee was an appropriate way of raising funds for such help was controversial enough, and many still argue the BBC was wrong to accept the task. But turning the BBC into another benefits agency is hardly core to its purpose and will most likely end in tears."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
