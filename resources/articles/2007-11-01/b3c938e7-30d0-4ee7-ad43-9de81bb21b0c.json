You will be", "bodyText": "Familiar scenario? An educational initiative is announced with a fanfare. It is espoused by the profession; becomes a roaring success owing to the huge amount of effort put into making it work... only for it to be scrapped suddenly and replaced by something different involving greater bureaucracy and cost, and leaving everyone confused and resentful. The case in point here is the dumping of the Cove (Centres of Vocational Excellence) programme. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is replacing it with a new kitemark for accrediting how well colleges and private training firms respond to employers and the quality of their training. This new process will be called - a trifle opaquely - the new standard. The Cove programme will be phased out over the next three years. It is all a part of the government's response to the Leitch report. The Cove programme was launched by the LSC in 2001 to improve the capacity of further education to deliver specialist training for employers. The LSC launched the programme with 16 Pathfinder Coves and by 2006 more than 400 centres had achieved Cove status, exceeding the LSC's target. Much hard work went on in colleges to provide evidence towards the award of Cove status, in the process refuting the government's mantra that colleges were inflexible and outmoded. There are buckets of research to show that colleges were successful in this and that the Cove \"brand\" has been extremely successful in attracting employers. Independent investigation carried out by consulting firms GHK and Ipsos, and commissioned by the LSC, shows that Cove branding was important or very important to 70% of employers in 2005. This was up from 50% in 2004. Even more - 83% - judged the quality of training excellent or good. The percentage of employers who would recommend a Cove to a business colleague was 89%. Employers, besides taking up training opportunities, have also offered sponsorship, scholarships, equipment, upskilling opportunities for lecturers, involvement in joint ventures, and development of materials. Employer networks have been very successful in involving them in curriculum development and offering work placements and jobs to students. The programme is supported by specialist development groups and regional networks and databases for sharing good practice. The 400 Coves, as a network, create a strategic distribution of high-quality centres, taking account of local, regional, national and sectoral needs. The Cove initiative, therefore, has been a great success. Employers understand them and have got the message that they offer good-quality training and are responsive to the needs of employers. So why replace such a well recognised and respected brand? The new standard will certainly be costly, at upwards of \u00a38,000 per application. It will also be complex, with 32 indicators covering 11 criteria. It appears as though it will do nothing to lessen bureaucracy either, with an estimated time of up to six weeks (the LSC's estimate) to complete the 75 pages of application forms. So complex will it be, in fact, that the LSC offers a two-day applicant training course to learn how to apply. While all eligible organisations will receive one free place at these courses, additional places will cost \u00a3495 plus accommodation and VAT. Assessment will take up to three months. There will be some benefits to the new standard. It requires a whole-college approach to engagement with employers, and the involvement of senior management is essential. Current Coves sometimes operate in isolated bubbles within the college community. It will also ensure that excellent provision can be recognised irrespective of whether the LSC feels there is already adequate Cove provision in the region. There is little doubt that a crude quota system currently operates. But as far as enhancing the reputation of the sector is concerned, the new standard risks being counter-productive. Employers are often confused enough already by the world of education and training. They will be bemused to find that Coves are to be discontinued; many in the sector will share this confusion. \u00b7 Rosemary Clark is an education consultant"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
