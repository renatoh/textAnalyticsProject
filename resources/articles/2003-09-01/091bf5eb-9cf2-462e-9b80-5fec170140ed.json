It looks as if Real Madrid will be taking only 15 players to the El Madrigal stadium. Roberto Carlos, Ronaldo and Esteban Cambiasso are away on international duty, Guti is injured and the club has a freakishly limited squad. After the weekend decision to let Fernando Morientes go to Monaco on loan, there are now 21 senior footballers left at Carlos Queiroz's disposal. Sir Alex Ferguson's former assistant cannot have imagined that he would be a man short for a full-scale practice match at his new club. Madrid have an unimpeachable right to think of themselves as Europe's, and probably the world's, greatest side. Beckham may start to notice that they are also one of the oddest. Madrid have a complete disregard for the basics. Managers always drone about building a side from the back but the precept would be an utter novelty rather than a clich\u00e9 at the Bernabeu. Queiroz's centre-backs at the weekend were the natural midfielder Ivan Helguera and Raul Bravo, whose reputation in Britain is yet to recover from his loan spell at Leeds. They cannot expect much cover either, now that Madrid have succumbed to Chelsea's \u00a316m offer for Claude Makelele. There did seem to be a subtle scheme in place to deal with the loss of the French international. Everyone believed that Helguera could step into Makelele's role once the hard-bitten Valencia centre-half Roberto Ayala moved to the Bernabeu. Events proceeded smoothly for a while, with the suddenly sensitive defender too upset by the situation to turn out against Valladolid on Saturday. In the end, however, Madrid chose not to complete the deal. Valencia wanted Real Mallorca's striker Samuel Eto'o in addition to the fee for the Argentina defender. Eto'o was once a Madrid player and the Spanish champions still own 50% of him, so they would have had to buy out the other half from Mallorca. Doing that and paying Ayala himself would have cost a total of some \u00a314m. Although that was still less than they had taken for Makelele, Madrid decided that the price was unacceptable. There is no limit to Madrid's desire for a Zinedine Zidane, a Ronaldo, a Luis Figo or a Beckham but they cannot work up much of an appetite for defenders. Queiroz would surely wish for a less haphazard back four but he ought to have known before he left Manchester that life in Madrid is an exercise in power-sharing with the general manager Jorge Valdano and the president Florentino Perez. Those two men must be besotted with the untethered imagination of the team. The players have no room in their minds for the uncouth aspects of the sport. So rarely and unconvincingly do they head the ball that it is if they learned everything they know about football from boyhood games of Subbuteo. While their feet are not fixed to plastic bases, the Madrid team is without any great penchant for harrying and covering. Beckham's readiness to enter the hurly-burly is as eye-catching for Bernabeu regulars as his skill. \"As a defender I feel protected,\" the right-back Michel Salgado said, with the surprise of a man more used to spying Figo in the distance on that flank. The spectator has no grounds for complaining about Madrid's free-form style. These are wonderful players who can make it up as they go along and emerge with the victories that have made them regular winners of the Champions League recently. They have collected that trophy at the expense of teams dedicated to fusty old discipline and strategy. The previous Madrid coach was unwilling to curtail the liberty of the team and the laissez-faire approach continues. \"Del Bosqueism without Del Bosque,\" said the Spanish sports daily AS of the harum-scarum defeat of Real Betis. Queiroz will be uneasy with that because he has a marked taste for fixed structure in a team. It is true that more orthodox players would not have half the ability of Zidane and the others who have brought the club such honours and adulation. Nonetheless Real may now have gone too far. The veteran Fernando Hierro was released in the summer and, with Real reluctantly allowing Makelele to leave, the side has even less defensive capacity than last season. And then they were so vulnerable that they were almost knocked out in the second group phase of the Champions League. The risks that lie ahead are hair-raising. Queiroz is a sensible man who finds himself shoved on to a tightrope."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
