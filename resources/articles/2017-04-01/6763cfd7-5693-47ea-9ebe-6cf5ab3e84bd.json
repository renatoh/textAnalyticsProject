A deeply compromised inquiry, admittedly; one with feeble terms of reference and presided over by interested theological parties, but still, a public acknowledgement that some sharia councils may be working, as the government said, in a \u201cdiscriminatory and unacceptable\u201d way. Maybe, ultimately, the inquiry could also serve as a warning to other courts whose judges routinely treat women like children or chattels, and subject them to moral lectures; who put them in danger of further domestic violence and deter others from seeking help; who find preposterous excuses for male brutality towards women, and who force wives to stay in miserable marriages. At some point, surely, alerted by the disturbing reports coming out of Britain\u2019s secular courts, the government will want to consider if this widespread disrespect for women should not also be examined, being so clearly at odds with human rights. If sharia\u2019s patriarchs are to face investigation for unacceptability, they could reasonably ask why the acceptable punishment in a British court, for a man like Mustafa Bashir \u2013 who terrorised and controlled his wife, Fakhara Karim, forced her to drink bleach, half strangled her, made death threats, and beat her with a cricket bat \u2013 is a short, suspended sentence. As for his victim, the judge, Richard Mansell QC, explained that Karim\u2019s status as an educated person with friends cancelled a sentencing outcome a more plausibly \u201cvulnerable\u201d woman might have expected. Not so much victim blaming as victim complimenting \u2013 but at a similar cost to justice. More bad news, anyway, if this is common judicial thinking, for the already troubled elite. Attend a Russell Group university and wave goodbye to courtroom credibility. Forge the occasional friendship \u2013 and accept that this could entitle any future domestic abuser to a similar right to leisure. With respect to Mansell, a highly educated and by all accounts, popular figure, he presumably realises the implications should, God forbid, he ever find himself at the mercy of an amateur cricketer like Bashir. It only adds to the case for a government inquiry, this time into the criminal justice system\u2019s treatment of women, that Mansell could, if he chose, cite so many equally weak deterrents to domestic abuse, at a time when on average two women a week are killed by exes or partners. In 2014, for instance, three police commissioners demanded investigation of a judge, George Moorhouse (since retired, uninvestigated), who handed down a 12-month suspended sentence to a man who bit and throttled his wife, held a knife to her throat, threatened to scald her, then shot her with a pellet gun. The same applies to discrimination. If Mansell showed little respect for Bashir\u2019s victim, it\u2019s not long since his colleagues in the Law Society were only grudgingly deterred from selling sharia-compliant wills, in which men inherit twice as much as women. As unappealing as they often sound, you wonder if members of sharia councils should really act more like conventionally trained lawyers. That is, where harmonisation is still required. Just recently, the high court backed the circuit judge Robin Tolson QC, who\u2019d told Tini Owens, a 66-year-old desperate for a divorce, that her husband\u2019s sustained unpleasantness did not meet, of itself, the definition of unreasonable behaviour. Tolson, by some years Owen\u2019s junior, instructed her that her misery was \u201cof the kind to be expected in marriage\u201d. One recalled a disturbing report, by Machteld Zee, in which she described women locked, by sharia, in \u201cmarital captivity\u201d. But differences remain. Are sharia elders, like our British QCs, also apt to think a sportsman should, when in the wrong, be entitled to special clemency? Such, at any rate, was the confidence that judge Mansell would be thus moved, that Bashir\u2019s counsel told the court some tale about his client being contracted to Leicestershire County Cricket club \u2013 a claim which seems to have annoyed people more for being untrue than for being utterly irrelevant. Would the savagery be excusable if Bashir played for England? There was every reason, however, to think that this particular judge would be awestruck by the wifebeater\u2019s batting. Last year, Mansell overturned a 21-day curfew just imposed on the Leicester footballer, Danny Simpson. The player had attempted to strangle his ex-partner, the mother of his child. Mansell agreed the curfew would quite spoil Leicester City\u2019s celebratory trip to Thailand. \u201cIt would damage the whole team spirit they have engendered throughout the season if he isn\u2019t there on this trip.\u201d In another significant departure from sharia practice, which is generally restricted to co-religionists, secular legal authorities are more likely to infantilise women at large, with lectures on desirable female conduct. No sooner, for instance, had retiring judge Lindsey Kushner cautioned women (although not the men who might rape them) on alcohol-induced vulnerability, than her colleague, Jamie Tabor QC, took the opportunity, after some teenagers had watched him sentence a paedophile, to lecture the girls (though not the boys) present. \u201cNever, ever, send photographs via the internet of yourself unless you are fully clothed and in a decent pose \u2013 and that is the best advice I can probably give you, ever.\u201d Hitherto, this moralist was perhaps best known for his suspended sentence for a controlling, violent man who assaulted his wife with a pickaxe handle, breaking her fingers. Philip Collings\u2019s crimes were uncovered by chance, after his step-daughter asked police visiting her school if it was right for a father to hit his child. Actually, the best advice I can give to a domestic abuser, ever, with Moorhouse being unavailable, is to come up against Tabor. Whether it comes in the shape of victim-blaming homiletic, or of selective exculpation for brutes, the message from British courts to women considering reporting abusive partners, is to manage any expectations of justice. Is it even worth reporting the strangler, the controller, the pickaxe-wielding assailant, if the resulting sentence is likely to be capricious, dismissive of harm, or calibrated, for severity, not on the perpetrator\u2019s crime, but on some judicial clown\u2019s assessment of the victim? Is she too sexually experienced or too well educated; too poised or too pissed? Or like the porridge in Goldilocks: just right? Launching a consultation on intimidatory offences, the Sentencing Council now affirms, too late for Karim, that offences committed in a domestic context are more, not less, serious than those enacted outside it. The Council hardly inspires confidence, however, in proposing, on the new crime of revenge porn, scrupulous measurement of harm done, to more or less vulnerable victims. There being, that implies, certain, perhaps immodest or non-religious kinds of women for whom being sexually abused, however briefly, by exposure on a pornographic or other public website, is something causing \u201cminimal distress\u201d. A bit like having an MA, while being strangled. Maybe the sharia inquiry will remind these professionals, not before time, that all, even women, are equal under the law.
