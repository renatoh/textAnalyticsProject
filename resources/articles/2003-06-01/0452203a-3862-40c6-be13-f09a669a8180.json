One more appearance and I would have clocked up two-score but I have never been one for round figures and hay fever is more debilitating even than Henmania. Retirement allows me to skip the SW19 scrum, thank goodness. It is a proof of sanity to love tennis but loathe Wimbers, although I fancy the opposite prevails with most people. My first day at work there was Monday June 22 1964. The defending champion CR McKinley (US) beat TJ Ryan (SA) in straight sets. I had left the Guardian the year before for a happy decade as an outside broadcasts producer for the fledgling ITV which, that June, had decided to take on the might of the BBC. We put up a tattered tent on the crest of Aorangi Park (now Henman Hill) and looked down on the flag-fluttering marqueed village of the BBC like the English at Agincourt. A suspicious All England officer-type was detailed to monitor our every move. It was the year they introduced the large scoreboard above the main concourse and that first day I was hauled in front of the beak and told they wanted to hear no more high-pitched squawks back to base through the walkie-talkie of our camp floor-manager, borrowed from the drama department, as he announced every 6-0 as six-nil. After which I was to be court-martialled almost daily - for allowing Clement Freud to carp about the price and taste of strawberries or young Willie Rushton to pooh-pooh the idea of a Briton ever winning the men's singles again. And, when we had Stephen Potter reading selections from his immortal \"Gamesmanship\" books, the lieutenant-colonel decreed his championships were being brought into disrepute and said: \"Laddie, you're in serious danger of a ban from these grounds for life.\" If only . . . Potter's wheel of fortune Almost 40 years on and the BBC is reprising the glories of that same Potter, who died in 1969, and his imperishable texts on the art of winning without actually cheating. At 3.30pm on Radio 4 tomorrow Stephen Fry profiles the essayist. I wonder if Fry names the precise afternoon that sporting one-upmanship was conceived: June 8 1931 at London's Birkbeck College, when Potter partnered the renowned professor of metaphysics CM Joad against two vibrant student champions. At once three aces have it 40-love to the zippy all-court kids in the opening game. To the fourth serve Joad desperately flails his racket at the perfect whizz-bang and the ball skews back high over the server's head into the stop-netting. Presuming the game won to love, the boys prepare to receive serve but Joad is at the net, demanding magisterially: \"Kindly say clearly, please, whether my return was in or out.\" Potter later explained the revelation. \"Young Smith stopped dead. There is nothing more putting off to young varsity players than the slight suggestion that their etiquette or sportsmanship is in question. Playing the point again, Smith sent down a double fault, then another. He did not get in another ace until halfway through the third set, which incidentally we also won. For me it was the birth of gamesmanship.\" Woodward simply the best That mercurial imp Clive Woodward truly is a treasure. England's rugby coach is surely on course for a knighthood. Let alone the results of his team, he has made watching them a pleasure. For his wit and honesty, his incisiveness, his daring, his superb delegating, his happy borrowing (with gracious thanks) from rugby league, his remarkable fusing of temperaments into a uniform peak of, and pride in, performance and the confraternal unselfishness he engenders in his squad, the happy-to-be-alive Woodward makes even more dull and deadpan his contemporaries in the other national sports. For a start he obviously knows what he is doing and where he is going. Compare the present jealousies in athletics, the mess of tennis, cricket's gloomy introvert Duncan Fletcher or soccer's sphinx-like Swede-in which context tomorrow is the anniversary of his stony-faced paralysis as England limply bowed out of the World Cup against 10 Brazilians. When Woodward's team did the deed last Saturday, I remembered the words not only of that prince of coaches Carwyn James - \"to beat All Blacks you need not so much skill but manliness and character\" - but also of James's deadly New Zealand rival Fred Allen, who gave best, saying his pre-eminence was due to \"resolving complexities into simplicities\". Woodward has obviously taken note. To England's greatest Wally Acres of space and hours of broadcasting time have been devoted to this year's birthday centenaries of Evelyn Waugh, George Orwell and even the aviator Amy Johnson but hardly a mention of Walter Hammond, born June 19 1903. The figures prove it - greater than Hobbs or Compton or Hutton, Gooch or Gower. The trouble is, Wally was apparently a miserable sod as well as an exact contemporary of Bradman. But here's to him: England's undoubted president of the immortals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
