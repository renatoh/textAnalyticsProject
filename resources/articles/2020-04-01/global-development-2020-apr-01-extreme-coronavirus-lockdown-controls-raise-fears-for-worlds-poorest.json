Police across the world have been given licence to control behaviour in a way that would normally be extreme even for an authoritarian state. On Tuesday, police in Kenya gave their \u201csincere condolences\u201d after a 13-year-old boy was shot and killed on his balcony in Nairobi as police moved through the neighbourhood, enforcing a coronavirus curfew. \u201cThey come in screaming and beating us like cows, and we are law-abiding citizens,\u201d said Hussein Moyo, the father of Yasin, the boy who was shot. Concerns are growing that police forces around the world are using gruelling and humiliating punishments to enforce quarantine on the poorest and most vulnerable groups, including tens of millions who live hand-to-mouth and risk starving if they do not defy lockdowns and seek work. Over the past week, footage has emerged showing migrant workers in India crouched on the side of the road as they are sprayed with chemicals, apparently an attempt to disinfect them before they entered their home province. The workers, who had returned from Delhi, were covered in a bleaching agent, sodium hypochlorite, which can cause damage to the skin, eyes and lungs, Indian Express reported. Elsewhere, in Punjab, people accused of breaking quarantine rules were made to do squats while chanting: \u201cWe are enemies of society. We cannot sit at home.\u201d Similarly humiliating tactics have been used by police in Paraguay, where people violating quarantine rules were made to do star jumps and threatened with a taser. Others were asked to repeat \u201cI won\u2019t leave my house again, officer\u201d while lying face down on the floor. Although there is a growing global consensus that efforts to protect public health in the face of the coronavirus pandemic demand temporary sacrifices of some individual freedoms, UN human rights experts have urged countries to ensure their responses by to the pandemic were \u201cproportionate, necessary and non-discriminatory\u201d. It is often the least well off - who cannot afford to stop working, or who are forced to walk for days to return to their family villages from the cities they worked in before the virus emerged - who are targeted by such punishments. In the Paraguayan capital, Asunci\u00f3n, Alberto Ru\u00edz, a member of a residents\u2019 social organisation in the deprived Tacumb\u00fa neighbourhood, told the Guardian that authorities had done very little to support families left without any income. Almost all citizens in the country are confined to their homes. \u201cThey tell you to stay at home, to protect your family. But in poor neighbourhoods, you have to go out to earn a living: if you don\u2019t, you die of hunger,\u201d Ru\u00edz said. Videos of the punishments in Paraguay \u2013 recorded and shared by officers themselves \u2013 were praised by the country\u2019s interior minister, Euclides Acevedo, who said: \u201cI congratulate them. I don\u2019t have the same creativity as those that are making the videos.\u201d In the Philippines, police and local officials trapped curfew violators in dog cages, while others were forced to sit in midday sun as punishment. The country\u2019s main Luzon island has been placed under a month-long lockdown, with more than 40 million residents asked to stay indoors. But remaining at home is a far more comfortable experience if you have the luxury of space. For those sharing cramped rooms with family members, the heat in Manila can be unbearable. Across the country, more than 17,000 people have been arrested for coronavirus lockdown-related violations, the website Rappler reported. Human Rights Watch has pointed out that such action is most likely to be counterproductive if offenders are then placed in overcrowded detention facilities. Activists in Kenya have warned that heavy-handed policing not only risks fuelling panic and fear but may also be heightening transmission of the virus. In the port city of Mombasa last week, police fired teargas at ferry commuters, causing hundreds of people crowded together to cough and wipe tears from their eyes. Officers were also filmed hitting people with batons. \u201cIf the operation was supposed to protect people from spreading the virus, the operation achieved the exact opposite,\u201d a statement by Kenya\u2019s police reforms working group said. There are also fears that governments are using concerns over the pandemic to increase their own powers, bringing in sweeping legislation that could be used to quash critical voices. On Monday, Hungary\u2019s parliament passed a new set of measures including jail terms for spreading misinformation and allowing the nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, to rule by decree under a state of emergency that has no clear time limit. In the Philippines and Thailand, states of emergency have been declared, granting governments greater powers for a temporary period. This includes the ability to crackdown on the sharing of false information \u2013 a vague term that activists fear could be misused by officials. In a recent report, Human Rights Watch said that freedom of expression and access to information should be protected by governments. While some restrictions on rights, such as those limiting freedom of movement, could be justified, the group called for transparency and \u201crespect for human dignity\u201d.
