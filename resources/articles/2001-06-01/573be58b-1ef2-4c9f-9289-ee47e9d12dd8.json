We offer five-day sailing holidays for 10- to 18-year-olds with full-board accommodation, supervised by our own care assistants, and with an evening activity programme. As a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) recognised teaching establishment and AALA licensed centre, the youngsters are taught by RYA qualified staff and our safety standards, after 23 years of experience, are second to none. Please call Rockley Watersports for more information and our brochure on 01202 677272, or email us at info@rockleywatersports.com. Lis Gordon \u0095 I was at school in Devon and we used to go camping in Cornwall during the holidays at that age. Either our parents would take us or we would catch a bus or train. We used to go to Rock and Polzealth - two small towns on the coast very near each other. There is a camp site in Polzealth overlooking the beach. There are always plenty of other young people and families - it was very safe but also brilliant fun because we could go without any parents. There is also surfing, and usually beach parties too. And it's cheap. Nida Al-Fulaij \u0095 My first holiday without parents was a BTCV conservation holiday. Get in touch with them at BTCV, 36 St Mary's Street, Wallingford, OX10 0EU, or email information@btcv.org.uk, or check their website: www.btcv.org Liz Moore \u0095 Paul Chapman's daughter and her friends could try youth hostelling. I believe that the YHA will accept bookings from unaccompanied teenagers. In return for paying a joining fee, they will have access to a large number of hostels in England and Wales (and may be able to use hostels in other countries). There are a large variety of hostels; as well as ones in areas popular with ramblers, there are hostels in cities and towns, and in coastal areas. Some hostels run special interest holidays. They are good value as far as price goes, offer various combinations of self-catering or meals. You also have the chance to meet people from other countries. Nowadays, you don't have to do chores either! Carol O'Byrne \u0095 When I was seventeen a friend and I went to the Edinburgh Festival and stayed in a youth hostel. We had a fantastic time; the youth hostel was cheap and provided good meals and we also had the advantage of being eligible for concessionary tickets for all the shows. The city is walkable so the fact that we couldn't drive wasn't a problem either. Hilary Ryan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
