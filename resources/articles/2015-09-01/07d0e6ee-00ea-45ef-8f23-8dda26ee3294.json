By the end of the week, the two events combined will have drawn more than a million visitors to the capital, filling hotel rooms, restaurants and plenty of coffers besides. They are lured to London by its enduring reputation as one of the world\u2019s truly creative capitals, and London makes sure that there\u2019s plenty for them to see. The fashion week, which this season moved from the elegant surroundings of Somerset House to a rather more downbeat decommissioned car park in the centre of Soho, offered up shows by 78 designers. It is anticipated that \u00a3100m of orders will be placed. For its part, the London design festival (LDF) \u2013 with hubs from Queen\u2019s Park in the northwest to Bankside over the river \u2013 helps ensure that the capital continues to be a design sponge, a city where people long to come to study, to shop, to open businesses. A place to find new talent and skilled employees. The mayor\u2019s office certainly thinks so. It gives the LDF \u00a3250,000 a year, and supports fashion week and Film London. It has also just sanctioned the return of the London games festival (video game design is big business, and London\u2019s position near the top of games production has recently slipped). But while it\u2019s all very well \u2013 and culturally and economically useful \u2013 to celebrate design, be it fashion or furniture, architecture or art, let\u2019s not forget that it must be nurtured and supported too. London\u2019s sparkly creative reputation isn\u2019t a fluke but is in large part derived from its historically excellent art school system. The system has produced individuals as diverse as vacuum cleaner king James Dyson and the maker of this year\u2019s Amy Whitehouse documentary, Asif Kapadia. Directors of Porsche and Mercedes design studios, the head of special effects at George Lucas\u2019s Industrial Light and Magic, top designers at Chlo\u00e9, Armani, Chanel and Louis Vuitton \u2013 they\u2019ve all come out of UK art schools, as have countless significant creative \u201cmovements\u201d. Schools are not solely bricks and mortar, but the students and teachers inside them. And exceptional types of both lead to exceptional results. When I met the American artist Robert Irwin recently, who tutored students including Ed Ruscha and Chris Burden in California in the 1960s and 70s, he said: \u201cThe good ones don\u2019t want any teaching. I just massaged their brains.\u201d From 1973 to 1988, that\u2019s what the artist and writer Michael Craig-Martin did at Goldsmiths college in London, and his adventurous methods of teaching fine art helped to produce Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume and others labelled with the Young British Artist tag. Sheep floating in tanks, paintings rendered in Dulux gloss \u2013 the tabloids might have had a field day, but the world woke up to London as a key art destination. Over at St Martin\u2019s college, between 1992 and 2014, the frequently terrifying Louise Wilson guided fashion designers such as Alexander McQueen and Christopher Kane into towering talents \u2013 as well as producers of valuable exports. The posthumous McQueen exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum in New York attracted 670,000 visitors; and a further half a million when it came to London. But straitened financial times in education are threatening to take away from our art schools exactly what makes them so special and so effective. Practitioner teachers, for a start, whose specialist knowledge is key to good art education: expertise is hard won and remains the bedrock of innovation. In parts of the Royal College of Art, the crucible of London postgraduate design education, practitioners are being replaced by \u201ceducationalists\u201d and academics, and its courses are in danger of becoming a commodity to be sold to those who can afford to pay. The free-wheeling creative journeys that brought on designers such as Thomas Heatherwick are being replaced by more prescribed experiences. Fabio Piras, Louise Wilson\u2019s successor at Central St Martin\u2019s, said recently that a student needs at least \u00a325,000 a year to get through the college\u2019s fashion MA. London art schools were once the ultimate social leveller, where an alumnus of Eton had no special advantage over a council estate kid. But it seems less likely that the artist Chris Ofili, who grew up modestly in Manchester, would be able to take up a place at the Royal College now (he studied there in the early 1990s). His large-scale glittery paintings now sell for millions. In economic terms alone, the relatively small investment in his education has reaped a rather handsome return. But where once the art school was a meeting place of all classes \u2013 which created a particular energy and range of ideas and experience \u2013 it\u2019s now a global meeting place, absorbing students from far and wide and offering a cross-pollination of cultures instead. That\u2019s wonderful too in other ways, but possibly a temporary situation. Countries such as China will not be educational cash-cows forever. In a fierce drive to move from \u201cmade in China\u201d to \u201cdesigned in China\u201d, the country is setting up its own schools, sometimes with staff who\u2019ve thrown in the towel in London. The art and design world being what it is \u2013 rebellious, ingenious, innovative and bloody-minded \u2013 is taking matters into its own hands. An alternative art college is being set up by the conceptual artist Ryan Gander in Suffolk; and an independent space run from a former library in Hackney \u2013 Open\u02da School East \u2013 is supported by practising artists and the occasional Tate curator who give their time for free. The London School of Architecture, chaired by the architect Nigel Coates, allows students to work nearly full-time, and have their employers pay their fees. And a group of designers in south London is looking for a space in which to carry out their educational dreams. London fashion week will return in February, when it will be sharing the city with the Baftas and the Brits, which reward film and music respectively. You might find Steve McQueen, the Oscar-winning filmmaker, at the first, and the musician Jarvis Cocker at the second, both fine art graduates from London schools. Just look where it can all lead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
