About 5,000 of the normally solitary crustaceans, which have spiky orange shells, have carpeted Mast Pond near the city's Historic Dockyard. Some of the crabs are 68cm (2ft) wide, though the smallest are only a few centimetres in diameter. They arrive at the pond from a tunnel connected to the sea and then clamber over the walls and each other. Scientists have found that male crabs are attracted to prospective females primarily by smell. Jacquie Shaw from the Historic Dockyard said it was not clear why the crabs had chosen that particular pond, but that it could be because it was a well-protected area for the creatures to continue their activities - albeit with a growing audience. \"There are just thousands of crabs and the view is amazing, especially when the sun is out,\" she said. \"They don't cause us any problems and the public love to stand and watch them - they really add to their visit.\" The Mast Pond, which is about 9 metres (30ft) long, was used for submerging and soaking timber that would be made into masts in the days of tall ships. It is believed the crabs will remain in the city for about a fortnight, before heading back to sea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
