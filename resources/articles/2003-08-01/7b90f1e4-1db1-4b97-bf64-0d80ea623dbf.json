Indeed an 89th-minute own- goal from Kevin Kyle appeared to have earned Keith Curle's pacey Third Division side extra-time only for Kyle to redeem himself deep in stoppage time by connecting with Matt Piper's cross and directing a low shot through a crowded penalty area and on beyond Kevin Pilkington's reach. In the first half Sean Thornton delivered the near-post corner from which Dave Artell headed the ball into his own net. It was only the third goal Sunderland had scored under McCarthy and it arrived as they looked ruffled by the pace of Junior Mendes and Iysedsen Christie. McCarthy's tension was borne out by the industrial language aimed at his players. Much of it appeared intended for Phil Babb, whose slapdash clearance almost presented Mendes with a goal. Only exceptional second- half saves from Mart Poom kept out Bobby Hassell and Lee Williamson. Then Kyle registered that own-goal. Liam Lawrence's cross bounced unfortunately off the substitute and the ball appeared to have crossed the line by the time Andy White arrived to rubber stamp the equaliser. Kyle, though, was destined to enjoy the last word. \u00b7 Hartlepool beat Sheffield Wednesday on penalties at Hillsborough. Graeme Lee gave the hosts the lead but Paul Robinson levelled and Hartlepool went ahead in extra-time thanks to Steven Istead. But Richard Wood levelled and the game went to penalties, Hartlepool winning 5-4."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
