Federighi said app updates in iOS 13 would be up to 50% smaller with 60% fewer updates and the new system would speed up other tasks, too, such as Face ID facial recognition unlocking the iPhone XS 30% faster. The big crowd pleaser, however, appeared to be the introduction of Apple\u2019s system-wide \u201cdark mode\u201d, which turns the user interface from black text on a white background to white text on a black background, as has become popular in a variety of apps. Dark mode reduces eye strain in low light conditions and saves battery power on top-end smartphones because black pixels on OLED screens \u2013 such as those on the iPhone X and XS \u2013 consume no power. Apple also introduced a new Apple social login system, which it compared to Google and Facebook\u2019s system of login to third-party services. \u201cSign in with Apple has all the convenience without giving away all your data,\u201d said Federighi. \u201cIt\u2019s the fast way to sign in without all the tracking, authenticated on device and logged in with a new account without giving away any information to a third party.\u201d If an app would like access to names or email addresses, it can ask and users have the choice to give the developer the data. \u201cBut if you choose to hide your email address, we\u2019ll create a unique random address that forwards to your real email address, and it\u2019s unique to the app so you disable it at any time,\u201d said Federighi. Apple announced a new HomeKit Secure Video system, which it says can encrypt and upload video from compatible home security cameras to iCloud accounts via iPads, Apple TV or HomePod speakers. Apple also added new portrait lighting effects, new Memoji stickers, smarter photo organisation and more advanced video editing to iOS, and it said it was working on a new updated Maps app for the US by the end of the year and other markets in 2020."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
