P\u00e4rt may be the Howard Hughes of classical music, but his fervently spiritual instrumental and choral works, with their slow-moving harmonies and crystalline textures, are very familiar as the musical embodiment of tragedy, loss and love in countless movies and TV shows. On camera, the 74-year-old looks gratifyingly like a recluse who has strayed blinking into the real world, with his intense eyes staring out from beneath his bald pate, and his thick, greying beard. \"We agreed to meet for lunch, and yes, of course he's formidable in person, but he was in a very twinkly mood,\" Russell Beale says. \"He had seen the first series of Sacred Music and greeted me with, 'Ah yes, the great Simon Russell Beale.'\" Russell Beale played P\u00e4rt the tape of a talk he recorded in 1968 for Estonian radio about his piece Credo, when Estonia was part of the Soviet Union. The work is shocking in the context of Soviet politics for its explicit use of liturgical words and imagery. P\u00e4rt was asked in 1968 who his influences are, and after Tchaikovsky, Mozart, Schubert, and Bach he said, \"Christ.\" Russell Beale takes up the story. \"That bit was censored by the Soviets when the interview was broadcast. I think he was very pleased to hear that interview again. And he was very affectionate. He gave me this huge hug at the end, before he went on his way \u2013 to find he'd got a parking ticket!\" The encounter with P\u00e4rt is the highlight of the third programme of the series, in which Russell Beale and his musical collaborators \u2013 conductor Harry Christophers and his choir, the Sixteen \u2013 travel to Estonia and Poland, exploring the music of P\u00e4rt and that other famous so-called \"holy minimalist\", Henryk G\u00f3recki. The popularity of both P\u00e4rt's and G\u00f3recki's music in the west crystallises the question at the heart of the whole series: how does today's sacred music function in our secular times \u2013 as spiritual meditation, musical experience or aural wallpaper? The first series of Sacred Music, broadcast a couple of years ago, told the story from plainchant to Bach, an era in which the shared, unquestioned faith of composers and audiences could be taken for granted. But that's not true for the later periods Russell Beale looks at in the four new programmes. He starts with Brahms and Bruckner in the 19th century, takes in Faur\u00e9 and Poulenc, and ends up with British composers John Tavener, James MacMillan and John Rutter, three of the most popular living composers of sacred music anywhere in the world. Russell Beale, who was brought up as a chorister in St Paul's, admits his own lack of faith in this series. \"I didn't mention it in the previous series, but I thought it was quite important in this one. I didn't want to be seen to be proselytising for something I'm not proselytising for.\" It's not the religion or the liturgy that matters for Russell Beale, but the beauty of the music. \"I have enormous respect for religion, and a huge interest in religious history, but I don't find myself having a faith.\" Harry Christophers describes himself as \"an Anglican, I guess \u2013 I don't go to church regularly\". And yet Christophers spends pretty well all of his professional life conducting the Sixteen in Sacred Music in churches around the country (the choir are currently on their annual Choral Pilgrimage around Britain's great religious buildings). How is it possible to love this repertoire as deeply as Russell Beale does, to conduct it as fervently as Christophers, or to hear the essential message of the music as a listener, if you don't share the same intense faith of a MacMillan, a Bruckner, or a Tavener? That's not the point, Christophers says. \"You don't have to have any faith or any religion at all to get something out of this music. If the music is good, it will do something to your soul. Hundreds of people come to hear us sing this music, and very few are believers as such. It's just staggering, the effect that this music can have on an audience. You feel with James MacMillan, for example, that he knows the biblical texts inside out, and there is something extra that comes through that engagement. And then there's Brahms, who wasn't a practising Christian, but who knew his Bible intimately, and knew what he wanted to express with the texts he used in a piece like the German Requiem.\" The agnostic Brahms is a talismanic figure for Russell Beale, too: \"His music tears my heart out. I just think it's the most honest music ever written. There's not a note you can't believe in \u2013 it just makes me sob.\" It's that quality of artistic honesty that he identifies as the defining factor that makes any piece convincing, whether it's written by a composer of faith or not. In the last film, John Rutter \u2013 most of whose compositional life has been spent in chapels and churches around the world \u2013 describes himself as \"one of nature's don't-knowers \u2026 I'm a believer for as long as it takes to write the piece\". For Russell Beale, that authenticity of engagement is the most important feature of today's sacred music. It's also what allows specifically religious music to communicate to non-religious audiences. \"I think James MacMillan's Strathclyde Motets are written honestly, and I think John Tavener's The Lamb is written honestly.\" Yet sacred music by Tavener, P\u00e4rt, and G\u00f3recki has a paradoxical place in today's popular culture. On every volume of \"relaxing classics\" compilations, you're likely to find sacred music by at least one of them, pieces whose smooth simplicity is commodified as an accompaniment to candlelight, meditation or even massage. It all started when Classic FM discovered G\u00f3recki's Third Symphony in 1992, and the piece exploded into the charts, a phenomenon Russell Beale recounts in his film. \"I think it's a marvellous piece of music,\" he says, \"but I was guilty when I first heard it of using it as a miraculous piece of meditative wallpaper. But the piece sets words written on the wall of a Nazi prison camp, so it's really a cry for help. And I didn't know that. This is emotionally complex music. And all of them \u2013 P\u00e4rt, G\u00f3recki, Tavener \u2013 are writing works that use the vocabulary of calm and stasis, but actually they're about dynamism and movement, and ultimately, about redemption and death. That's the confusion in my head: I was using it as a kind of spiritual wash, and it's not.\" Christophers goes further. \"There's a big danger this repertoire can be classed as mood music, used by record companies to soften the soul. But the people who come to our concerts don't say that it's wallpaper music. They say it's doing something to them. They feel the power of the music. And for us as performers, the day it becomes mood music is the day we give up.\" As Russell Beale says at the end of the series, these pieces by everyone from Brahms to MacMillan are \"experiences: deep, deep spiritual experiences\". All music, according to MacMillan, is a means of \"searching out the sacred\". If Russell Beale and Christophers haven't got the final answers to how this music manages that spiritual alchemy, they share its mysteries and beauties, and show us why sacred music still matters. Sacred Music begins tonight on BBC4. The Sixteen's Choral Pilgrimage continues on Saturday in Cambridge, and tours until 30 October.
