The education secretary, Betsy DeVos, had been under fire since her department\u2019s budget proposal for the next fiscal year did not include US funding for the Special Olympics. \u201cAs you know, budgeting within the administration is a collaborative one. As I said then, and I\u2019ll say again, we had to make tough choices and decisions around budget priorities,\u201d DeVos had said earlier on Thursday. He added: \u201cI wanna fund the Special Olympics, and I just authorized a funding of the Special Olympics. I\u2019ve been to the Special Olympics, I think it\u2019s incredible ... We\u2019re funding the Special Olympics.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments came as his administration faced widespread outrage over its proposal to do away with federal funding for the Special Olympics \u2013 a 51-year-old program offering school programming and sports competitions and training for the disabled \u2013 from its 2020 budget. Trump\u2019s budget proposed $17.6m in cuts to the Special Olympics as part of an overall 10% reduction in the budget for the Department of Education. DeVos struggled to explain the decision this week as lawmakers grilled her during an appearance on Capitol Hill. \u201cI still can\u2019t understand why you would go after disabled children in your budget,\u201d the congresswoman Barbara Lee, a Democrat from California, told DeVos at a hearing. \u201cYou zero that out. It\u2019s appalling.\u201d DeVos subsequently defended the move in a statement that sparked its own controversy for blaming the media, without evidence, of misrepresenting the proposed cuts but then acknowledging them to be true. DeVos added that while she personally supported the Special Olympics and its mission, the federal government \u201ccannot fund every worthy program, particularly ones that enjoy robust support from private donations\u201d. \u201cThere are dozens of worthy nonprofits that support students and adults with disabilities that don\u2019t get a dime of federal grant money,\u201d DeVos said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
