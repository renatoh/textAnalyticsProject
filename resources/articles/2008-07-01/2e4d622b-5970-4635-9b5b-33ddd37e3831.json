Like many musicians of the predominantly white \"cool school\" of the 1950s, Pepper favoured long, twisting, unemphatic melody lines over big climaxes or raucous blues-bashing. But he wasn't the stereotypical cool-jazzer. His emotional edginess lead him to far more unpredictable, almost Monkish alternations of urgency and silence; his tone pulsated with passion and doubt. This four-CD collection traces his work between 1952 and 1957, from Charlie Parker-inflected music through the 1956 Hollywood sessions that included Baker and the incomparable tenor-sax master Warne Marsh (one of Pepper's most compatible partners), up to a legendary session in Miles Davis's rhythm section - the eight tracks from which are worth the box."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
