Photograph: Getty The news in today's Observer that Picture House cinemas are to experiment with popcorn-free films may come as no surprise to devotees of the independent cinema chain more used to yoghurt coated raisins and the delights of taking a G&amp;T into the auditorium than scoffing huge quantities of exploded maize. Personally I've never been a big fan, often goggling in disbelief at the giant buckets of the stuff people haul onto their laps as the Pearl and Dean theme tune plays (I've also been a bit wary of any food served in a bucket since first watching Monty Python's Meaning of Life), but each to their own. I defy anyone, however, not to feel sorry for the cinema cleaning staff who have to deal with drifts of dropped and discarded corny detritus after every screening. My own cinema addiction is Revels. I'm not proud of it but I have happily consumed an entire large bag before the appearance of the BBFC classification card on more than one occasion (and will doubtless do so again despite that execrable TV ad taking off The Deer Hunter). What do you like to take into the auditorium in unhealthy quantities? Is popcorn all part of the sacred ritual of going to the movies, or is a popcorn-free cinema experience just what you've been waiting for?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
