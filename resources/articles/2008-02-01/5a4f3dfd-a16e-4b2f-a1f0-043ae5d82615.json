The assumption - shared by President Bush and much of the DC foreign policy community - was that the Bearded One's half-century as Havana's undisputed top dog had come to an end: his political demise was surely imminent, and that meant the beginning of the end for Cuba's communist government. More than a year and a half later, of course, Castro's Caribbean communists are still going strong. Perhaps it's hardly surprising, then, that the Cuban leader's Shermanesque letter of resignation didn't spark dancing in the streets of Miami. These days, even Calle Ocho's hardliners are resigned to the fact that Fidel's formal retirement won't change much of anything. That's a testament to the octogenarian strongman's success in choreographing his slow-motion departure from political life. Most Cuba-watchers expected Castro to cling to power as long as he had a breath in his body - and believed Fidel's eventual demise would trigger the disintegration of his regime, throwing Cuba into post-communist convulsions and ultimately paving the way for a transition to capitalism and democracy. Instead, by gradually relinquishing control, Fidel has been able to ease into a new role as dictator emeritus while supervising the changing of the guard. The Cuban leader's long convalescence allowed him to anoint his brother Ra\u00fal as his heir apparent - and to shape his legacy from the sidelines, ensuring that as president pro tem his brother kept the revolution on the right track. His formal resignation is the logical next step in this process, giving Ra\u00fal the space to begin asserting his leadership but allowing Fidel to remain on hand as a \"soldier in the battle of ideas\", ensuring that any changes take place strictly on El Comandante's terms. That's not to say that Fidel's departure won't bring real change to Cuba. Ra\u00fal may lack his brother's charisma and intuitive grasp of the nuances of the political game, but he's a smart, pragmatic technocrat with a clear understanding of Cuba's need for reform. Overhauling the country's economy will be top of his list: unemployment, low pay and shortages are top of most Cubans' concerns, ranking well above the political freedoms that get so much attention from well-meaning gringos. Ra\u00fal tried to introduce gradual free-market reforms back in the 90s only to be snubbed by his brother. This time around, he'll be keen to begin pushing through his vision. Castro's drift to the sidelines also clears the way for tentative social and political reforms. So far, Ra\u00fal has struck a relatively conciliatory tone toward the US and has given the appearance of wishing to edge away from his brother's absolute intolerance of political dissidence. The number of political prisoners in Cuba has gradually dwindled since Ra\u00fal took the reins, and his administration has even encouraged public criticism of its policies. It's not yet clear whether this is a genuine shift toward greater political freedom, a safety valve intended to obviate the need for more sweeping reforms or merely Havana's Hundred Flowers moment. Either way, these tentative first steps are a sign that Ra\u00fal and the party cadres have a plan for the future and won't be crying uncle simply because Fidel has begun cashing his pension checks. That's a jab in the eye for George Bush, who'd assumed that regime change would be the inevitable consequence of Castro's departure. That certainty bred complacency: rather than reaching out to the next generation of Cuban leaders, Bush stuck to a more-of-the-same Cuba policy, continuing to serve up the economic sanctions and confrontational rhetoric that for decades have only bolstered the Castro regime. Fidel has seen nine US presidents come and go and made no secret of wanting to add Bush to that list. But while Fidel may not have outlasted Dubya, he certainly outfoxed him. The smoothness of the handover of power in Havana has left the White House's Cuba policies looking dated, clumsy and ineffectual. So far, there's no sign that Bush will learn his lesson. His administration greeted Castro's resignation by deriding Ra\u00fal as \"Fidel lite\" and promising that the island's economic embargo would not be lifted \"anytime soon\". That's disappointing. The closure of this chapter in Cuban history presents a rare opportunity for Washington to move away from its decades-old, failing policies without losing too much face. If Bush sticks to his guns and ultimately proves unable to adjust to Cuba's new political reality, he'll be giving Fidel the sweetest retirement gift of all.
