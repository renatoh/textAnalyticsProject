Chelsea continue to await the full written judgment from Fifa ahead of mounting their appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, having been banned from registering any new players until 2011 for inducing Ga\u00ebl Kakuta to breach his contract with Lens two years ago. The Premier League club had been expecting Fifa's dispute resolution chamber to adjudicate on the case towards the end of the year and were caught out by the swiftness, and level, of the world governing body's sanction when faxed confirmation reached them last week. They should know before the end of the year whether the ban will stand. Ancelotti, who defended the role of the club's sporting director, Frank Arnesen, had not anticipated making any signings in the midwinter window anyway but, with the African Cup of Nations to come in January, he will consider recalling players currently on loan should injuries and suspension eat into his options. \"I saw it on the internet,\" he admitted. \"I did not know about this. I was surprised, but life goes on. The club are appealing the decision and we hope that they overturn the decision. I'm sure Fifa can change this decision. I didn't speak with Frank Arnesen. He's been working very closely with me but, in this period, there weren't any games so I didn't speak with him. But he's doing a very good job now, for me and for the club. And I have not had any reason to speak with [the owner] Roman Abramovich about the situation. \"We didn't think we would bring any new players in during January. Even before this happened. Some players will go to the African Cup of Nations, but we have very good players \u2013 like Joe Cole, a very important player for us \u2013 who will be ready [to replace them] then. There is potential in the academy, but we have to take our time because they are very young players. But, if we need them, we can get the players back who are on loan \u2013 Franco Di Santo, Scott Sinclair, Michael Mancienne \u2013 to cover for the African players.\" Chelsea, who will continue to monitor Yuri Zhirkov's knee ligament complaint, will play Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool and Manchester United within the next two months, as well as embarking upon their Champions League campaign. Although Ancelotti does not believe the sense of injustice at the club will serve to motivate his players further, he admitted his side's prospects of success for the season ahead will have become considerably clearer after the busy period ahead. \"The motivation is there already. The players have a good mentality and are used to trying to win the Champions League and the championship. It's not necessary to have an extra motivation. I don't have any doubts about the quality of the squad but we must play now against opponents who have very good quality in this period. After this period, we'll know better how our season is going to pan out.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
