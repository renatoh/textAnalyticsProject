Have you seen every goalkeeper/1500m runner/ice-dancing pair on the planet? Maybe there is somebody in Chad who is better.\" One day, when he proclaimed that Michel Platini was the greatest footballer of the age, I pounced with a yell like a missionary spotting a non\u2011believer in an iron lung: \"But how can you say that? Maybe there is someone in Ulan Bator who is even more creatively languid.\" \"I can say it easily,\" the Frenchman responded with the sort of sneer you might have expected to appear on the face of Ayrton Senna if somebody told him Nigel Mansell looked better in swimming trunks than he did, \"because Platini is Platini.\" On Saturday, as I filled in my first World Cup wall chart in a bid to work out who would win the tournament, I thought of the Frenchman, because in sport lack of empirical evidence \u2013 or indeed any evidence whatsoever \u2013 is no barrier to holding a firm conviction about things. \"Honduras versus Chile in Nelspruit? I'm saying a narrow 1-0 to the Men from the Land of the Jicaro Tree, probably via a disputed penalty. What about you?\" I said to my mate Tony. I didn't get a response. Tony was too busy making predictions of his own. Inspired by the splendid Animal Olympics series, Tony has drawn up a proposal for a new television show \u2013 Jesus Christ Superstars \u2013 in which, using the wonders of CGI, top proclaimers of divine messages from down the ages will compete to see who is most worthy of the title Sporting Messiah. Tony is convinced that Old Testament badass Ezekiel \u2013 whose message of destruction marks him out as the John Beck of the Fertile Crescent \u2013 will ultimately triumph, though the view from here is that the prisoner of Babylon would find his long beard a severe impediment when doing the chin-ups. When I suggested to Tony that Brian Jacks would be easily capable of beating all the prophets whatever their creed or sect, he replied testily that if I was saying that the blond, bubble-permed 1970s British judo ace would be better at squat-thrusts than Mohammed, then I could deal with the death threats, because he already had enough on his plate working out who'd win the 50 metres freestyle \u2013 the Gautama or Guru Nanak. This was a bit of a puzzle to me, because it seemed plain that if Jehovah parted the Red Sea for the Children of Israel, he would have no trouble with a swimming baths, allowing Moses to sprint to an easy victory. \"It's not as simple as that,\" Tony snapped back. \"There are dozens of imponderables.\" Well, of course there are. Paul Gascoigne once said: \"I never make predictions and I never will do\", and frankly who can blame him? As the World Cup rumbles towards us, however, predictions become as unavoidable in our daily lives as the word \"legacy\" is in the utterances of Lord Coe. Like records, predictions are there to be trampled on by history. The sporting scene is littered with men and women who have been laid out by their own back-firing prophecies. Who among us can forget Graham Taylor's ill-advised entreaty before the 1992 European Championships to \"put your feet up, get a few beers in and let me do the worrying\"? Or Alan Minter's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the many things he was going to do to Marvin Hagler when the two met for the middleweight championship of the world in 1980, which, unfortunately for the sake of accuracy, did not include \"bleed all over him\"? Happily, when it comes to judging the future some sporting matters are much easier to get right. I can say for certain, for example, that in South Africa whichever nation you happen to be supporting will never look as dangerous from corners as the side they are playing (unless, of course, the side they are playing is England, in which case they will look infinitely more threatening, to me at least). I can also say with cast-iron certainty that at some point when you are watching a game in the pub you will find yourself sitting in front of a bloke who can see exactly what is going wrong out there and knows just how to put it right. I am 100% positive too that his solution to the problem will not involve flair, panache or subtlety but a series of acts of wild and brute aggression: \"We wanna stop fannying about and get stuck in. We wanna give it some throttle. We wanna see how clever this Messi is with a 14-stone skinhead stuck up his arse.\" Yes, I can tell you those things without fear of contradiction. But to be honest, when it comes to New Zealand versus Slovakia in Rustenberg, or a 100m sprint featuring Brigham Young, Isaiah and David Icke, well, your guess is as good as mine, really."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
