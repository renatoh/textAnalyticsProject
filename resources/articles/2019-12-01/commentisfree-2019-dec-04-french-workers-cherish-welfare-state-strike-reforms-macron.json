That\u2019s why they\u2019re striking", "bodyText": "It\u2019s shaping up to be one of France\u2019s biggest strikes in recent memory. Responding to calls from unions to protest against the government\u2019s proposed retirement reforms, an impressive swath of the workforce plans to walk off the job tomorrow \u2013 everyone from railway workers and truckers to judges, nurses, teachers and students. While it has yet to introduce legislation, Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government has floated a proposal that would mark the deepest overhaul of France\u2019s pension system since its creation in the aftermath of the second world war. This would effectively hike the earliest age at which one can collect so-called full retirement benefits from 62 to 64, overhaul the formula for calculating benefits and merge the country\u2019s 42 existing pension schemes into a single regime \u2013 all in all, resulting in likely benefit cuts for millions. Authorities have defended their ambitions with the language of French republicanism, vowing to forge a \u201cuniversal system\u201d in which everyone is treated equally. But what they neglect to mention is that the new standard would be worse than today\u2019s. Yes, Macron\u2019s reforms would probably save money \u2013 under the current system, authorities face a total pension deficit slated to reach between \u20ac8bn and \u20ac17bn by 2025. But they would also take a bludgeon to one of the best retirement systems in the world. In France, just 7% of older people are at risk of poverty. This is the lowest rate in the European Union, much less than the 19% in the UK and Germany. It\u2019s also likely to be part of the reason why France has slightly greater life expectancy than either country. A system like this ought to be cherished and expanded, not cut. Predictably, the French government has sought to paint opposition to retirement reform as \u201ccorporatist\u201d \u2013 an unhelpful backlash from pockets of workers aiming to preserve their own advantages, along with the usual bunch of hardline trade unionists. And indeed, the call to strike initially came from militant railway workers with relatively good benefits. But it has since spread elsewhere: to state schoolteachers, hospital staffers, postal workers and employees of the state electricity provider. Student unions and groups of gilets jaunes (yellow vests) looking to re-energise their year-long protest movement have also joined the cause. Those planning to protest appear increasingly like a cross-section of French society, brought together by a shared goal. A poll published on Wednesday found that nearly six in 10 people support the strike. Sympathy for the strike has been fuelled by frustrations over Macron\u2019s broader economic record. Retirement reform is only his latest effort to chip away at the welfare state. Since taking office in 2017, the president has also slashed unemployment benefits and made it easier for companies to fire workers, while keeping a tight lid on the cost of public services. At the same time, he has replaced the country\u2019s wealth tax \u2013 which once applied to all those with \u20ac1.3m in assets \u2013 with a tax on property holdings valued above that level. As the gilets jaunes expressed in such dramatic fashion, ordinary French people are increasingly forced to make sacrifices while the super-rich get government handouts. If there is a unifying thread behind Macronism \u2013 a vision that links these various reforms \u2013 it is the notion that France must be made more attractive for business. This has always been an obsession of the nation\u2019s top employers\u2019 lobby, the Movement of the Enterprises of France. But it\u2019s only grown since the 1980s, when France\u2019s neighbours began pursuing pro-business reforms at a much brisker pace. Regretful that they never had a Reagan or Thatcher of their own, much of France\u2019s commercial elite now share a sense that their country is economically backwards: that there\u2019s too much red tape, too many pro-worker rules, that state spending unfairly crowds out the private sector. The pension system is emblematic of these frustrations: where retirees see a source of hard-won benefits, bosses and reformers see a costly dinosaur fed by payroll taxes. It\u2019s hard to have much sympathy for those who are whining. After all, France still has the world\u2019s sixth largest economy, and the rich have no problem making money here. There are more than 40 billionaires; last year, France\u2019s companies paid out more dividends to shareholders than anywhere else in continental Europe. But more importantly, France can boast one of the most successful welfare states in the world. That\u2019s a major reason why the country has a lower poverty rate than its often-idealised American, British and German counterparts. The safety net also helped soften the blow of the last economic crisis, a lesson that authorities would do well to remember as the global economy slows down. Protesters in France will probably be derided as unrealistic, as stubborn defenders of an old-fashioned model in need of change. What\u2019s actually far more outdated in 2019 is Macron\u2019s insistence on chipping away at an effective and popular social welfare programme. One need only look at the state of the countries that French business elites look up to with such fondness. On paper, the UK and US might be more economically competitive than France, but at what cost? Can anyone truly say that neoliberal reforms have made them better countries to live in? In this case, like so many others, the people on the streets in France will carry far more wisdom than the national assembly or the Elys\u00e9e palace. The country\u2019s welfare state is a world-class achievement that ought to be protected, not hollowed out for savings. \u2022 Cole Stangler is a journalist based in Paris"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
