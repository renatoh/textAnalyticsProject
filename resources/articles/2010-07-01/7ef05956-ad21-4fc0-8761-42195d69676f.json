That's a steep price for an internship, 8 July) highlights a number of important points. However, it seems to accept the notion of \"interns\" as legitimate and, in the great majority of cases, it isn't. \"Intern\" is the latest phoney euphemism that attempts to present employing people for no pay as acceptable. However, like \"work experience person\" and \"volunteer\", it has no legal status. While work experience is a valid form of introducing students to the world of work, within clearly defined parameters, using free labour to do your business on the cheap is not. Where people are working for an employer, at a place and at times as directed, they are \"workers\" within the meaning of employment legislation, and are entitled to receive at least the national minimum wage for their efforts. This was established by the London Dreams v Nicola Vetta case, in which Nicola, supported by Bectu (Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union), won a claim for the minimum wage, despite having previously agreed to work for no pay. The point here is that nobody can \"agree\" to an unlawful arrangement. And denying people the minimum wage, whether agreed or not, is unlawful. Bectu operates in the film and television industries where the cynical exploitation of mainly young people is rife, at least at the low-budget end of the market. We are doing all we can to stop this practice, because it is wrong, wherever it raises its unlawful head.
