Biarritz have set themselves up for a likely all-French semi-final against the holders Toulouse, who meet Edinburgh today, while Llanelli have the scant consolation of the Celtic League after their biggest home defeat in the tournament. The Scarlets took 26 minutes to launch their first meaningful attack but the centre Mark Taylor knocked on to waste an overlap before a surging run by the Biarritz second-row David Couzinet would have ended with a try but for the No8 Thomas Lievremont's second unforced knock-on. Biarritz's mauling gave the video referee Roy Maybank some viewing at the end of the first half as they twice forced their way over the line but there were too many bodies to tell whether the ball had been grounded on the first occasion before Scott Quinnell got under Ovidiu Tonita. Biarritz were not to be denied and Couzinet forced his way over at last, which had the effect of injecting some passion into Llanelli's play and the half ended frenetically. Stephen Jones was denied a try when he was tripped by Dimitri Yachvili as he chased his own chip to the line. It should have been a penalty try but Jones had to content him self with a penalty and Serge Betsen saw yellow for an earlier offence at a ruck. Llanelli wasted their man advantage by conceding a soft try 90 seconds after the restart. The wing Philippe Bidabe sped past the tight-five forwards Vernon Cooper and John Davies on a 50-yard break, which was finished off by Nicolas Brusque. When Julien Peyrelongue dropped a goal on 57 minutes to put his side 15-3 ahead it looked over for the home side. It would have been had Philippe Bernat-Salles, catching a Yachvili chip on his own 25, not kicked the ball directly into touch after reaching halfway with Martin Gaitan free inside. The Scarlets coach Gareth Jenkins had called the Heineken Cup his holy grail but w hat appeared another fruitless quest turned into a memorable finish as Stephen Jones, with virtually his side's first attack of the half, finished off a crisp move. Llanelli laid siege to the Biarritz line but seemed unaware of the time they had left, rushing too many passes and dabbling in the outrageous. It left them vulnerable to a counter-attack and Biarritz's first visit to the Llanelli half for 15 minutes ended with Brusque scoring his second try before Bernat-Salles ended what had become a rousing affair in stoppage time.
