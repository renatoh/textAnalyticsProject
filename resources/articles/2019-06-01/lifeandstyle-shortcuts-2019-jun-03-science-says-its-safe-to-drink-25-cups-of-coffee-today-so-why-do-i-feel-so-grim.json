My editor asks me to attempt to drink 25 cups of coffee by 1pm and write about what that is like. It\u2019s OK, I won\u2019t die, he \u2013 and science \u2013 says. Coffee has been previously thought to stiffen arteries and increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke, but a new study by researchers at Queen Mary University of London and part-funded by the British Heart Foundation has found that drinking five cups a day \u2013 even 25 \u2013 is no worse than one. I\u2019ve had one at home, quite strong, from the moka pot, with a dollop of frothy milk, and normally I\u2019d have one or two more over a morning. But this is research, I take my journalism very seriously. I have two more quickly, black, from the office coffee machine (Colombian beans, quite nice, in moderation). And then another, even though I really don\u2019t want it. 11am. My arteries might not be hardening, and my heart doesn\u2019t seem to be racing, but \u2013 and it\u2019s a big but \u2013 I\u2019m feeling a bit queasy and not at all like more coffee right now. And I\u2019ve had only four. Just 21 to go, then. Except that\u2019s the quota for the day, and I have just got the morning, so maybe I can get away with 12? Still, the idea of another black coffee makes me feel ill. I\u2019m going out for one. 12pm. I go to Pret a Manger for a cappuccino. Extra shot? That would count as two right? Shot me up. And a receipt \u2013 I\u2019m totally expensing this. But that\u2019s still only six. I suppose decaf would be cheating \u2026 1pm. I manage two more. OK, one and a half, seven and a half in total. That\u2019s it, I\u2019m done. I\u2019m not just feeling nauseous, but jittery and shaky, too. Who the hell are these caffeine freaks who drink 25 coffees a day? I don\u2019t care if the pointy-heads at Queen Mary say it\u2019s not doing my heart health any harm, I feel grim. Also, coffee breath! Perhaps they should do a study into that: the effects of 25 cups of coffee on your oral hygiene. Now I\u2019m going to see my editor, to snap at him, and breathe on him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
