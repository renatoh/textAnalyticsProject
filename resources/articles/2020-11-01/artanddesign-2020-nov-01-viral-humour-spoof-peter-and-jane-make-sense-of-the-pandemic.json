In We Do Lockdown, Miriam Elia, a visual artist, has her characters Mummy, John and Susan swamping their garden in bleach, taping off Granny\u2019s house with hazardous material tape and growing highly sceptical of scientific advice. \u201cI created the book because I\u2019m an artist and I respond to whatever\u2019s happening around me and this is such a traumatic thing to happen that it just felt the natural thing,\u201d Elia says. \u201cAlso, I\u2019ve been stuck at home and needed to occupy myself. I\u2019ve always had this theory that if you\u2019re restricted in some way it can be a very creative process because when you can\u2019t do things, you have to be more imaginative.\u201d The book finds humour and hypocrisy in the current situation and is more than a light spoof of the Peter and Jane books. There\u2019s a fair amount of political dart-throwing. Mummy is also having a surreptitious lockdown-infringing affair with the government\u2019s chief epidemiologist (\u201cNew words: Sexy. Rule. Breaking.\u201d) and the homeless are ignored because they can\u2019t take contactless payments. Waterstones has ordered 8,000 copies for its stores, indicating that the chain expects We Do Lockdown to be one of its biggest sellers in the run up to Christmas. Such timing knits with some of the book\u2019s sharp content. \u201cOne of my favourite spreads is where Mummy says, \u2018Oh no, we can\u2019t see Grandma,\u2019 and Peter points out that they haven\u2019t seen her since last Christmas anyway,\u201d says Elia. The book is published on 5\u2002November (the day that lockdown is reintroduced in England) by Elia\u2019s own imprint, Dung Beetle Books. The 1950s style of the illustrations and the characters who inhabit that world add to the surrealist absurdity of the book. Elia creates the works by making a collage and then adding watercolour, to mimic the original aesthetic of the books. \u201cThe 50s styling is very important to the effect because the 50s and 60s were this time of tremendous optimism and modernity postwar,\u201d she says. \u201cYou had the welfare state, the pill for women \u2013 a real sense of change. Humour comes when you contrast two worlds very clearly together, so I\u2019ve taken that postwar optimism and contrasting it with this brutal nihilism that we have now. And also, on an aesthetic level, I absolutely adore that era, so it\u2019s just a pleasure for me. \u201cIt also works because the characters have this conformity to them \u2013 the boy always wears the same jumper and Mummy looks like Queen Elizabeth. And we all have to conform right now: wear a mask, do this. You can\u2019t meet grandma but you can meet your mates in the pub or go out for a day\u2019s foxhunting. It didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d In 2014 Elia was embroiled in a legal dispute with Penguin, which owns the Ladybird imprint, over her first book in the series. Elia said it was art, Penguin said it was breach of copyright. The dispute was eventually settled and Penguin later published its own Ladybird spoofs that have proved immensely popular. Elia has also just finished making a short film with Vic Reeves, in which Elia is chased through London by a giant Covid virus and Reeves is a lockdown policeman attempting to intervene. The virus is \u201cplayed\u201d by a spiky yoga ball on a fishing line. It has been produced by Reeves\u2019s son, the film-maker Louis Moir."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
