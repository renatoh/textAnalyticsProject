Now research emerges to prove that Wooster couldn't, after all, have been thick as a plank, because \u2013 as he always suspected \u2013 grey matter matters. People with one gene, found scientists at King's College London, had a thinner cortex in the left hemisphere (and thus less of the so-called grey tissue, which, in the living, retains a pink hue) and also fared worse in trying to solve tricky problems. All this accounts for 0.5% of observed variation in intelligence, leaving 99.5% still to be sorted out.
