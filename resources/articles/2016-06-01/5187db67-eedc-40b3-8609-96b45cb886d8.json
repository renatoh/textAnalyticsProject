What are you doing for Mother\u2019s Day?\u201d says no normal human being ever. But they do in this film, the third in an escalatingly creepy series of sentimental \u201cday\u201d-themed ensemble romcoms from director Garry Marshall, following Valentine\u2019s Day and New Year\u2019s Eve. The next in the series could be Hitler\u2019s Birthday with Jennifer Aniston as Eva Braun, Kate Hudson as Leni Riefenstahl and Julia Roberts as Rommel. It couldn\u2019t be as offensive and reactionary as this skin-crawlingly smug film set in upscale Atlanta, Georgia: the white part of town, evidently, with one south Asian guy permitted to have a halfway important speaking role, on condition that he is the subject of racist gags and that his emollient forgiveness permits picturesque ageing bigots to regain their essential lovability. The idea is that Mother\u2019s Day is coming (deeply important) and all the adorable characters must deal with their emotions about being moms, about being kids of moms, and about \u2013 choke! \u2013 the mom of their kids, who is now dead. Jason Sudeikis is the cute widower who visits the grave of his kids\u2019 dead mom but who is also destined to cop off with kooky divorcee Jennifer Aniston. Julia Roberts plays an uptight jewellery designer in a frigid Anna Wintour hairdo, richly eligible for redemption through motherhood. Jack Whitehall plays a milky-faced new dad. There\u2019s a gay character and a character married to that south Asian guy: uproarious gags about their mixed-race kid called Tanner. It\u2019s as feelgood and life-affirming as a fire in an asbestos factory neighbouring a children\u2019s hospital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
