And, living in Fiver Towers with only Sky Sports News for company, this is usually an easy policy to uphold. Not so today, when - after nine months of earnest discussions, expense account lunches, and a quick flick through Football for Dummies - the All-Party Football Group published their long-awaited report (What? Eh? Oh? etc) on the state of our national game. Not surprisingly, some of it was as embarrassing as watching Tony Blair donning a tracksuit and having a kickabout with some bewildered nine-year-olds. \"We strongly support the notion of severe point deductions for clubs going into administration,\" announced breathless chairman Alan Keen, apparently oblivious to the fact that said notion had already been conceived, discussed and voted in favour of. \"And clubs should declare exactly how much money is involved in transfers!\" he shouted, slamming his fist on the table and beating his chest - even though the Premier League has agreed to do this already. Still, there was plenty of good stuff too, with the all-party group calling for the Premier League to give a further 5% (\u00a330m) of their TV income to the Nationwide League and Conference, for the powers of the Independent Football Commission to be beefed up, and for the Premier League to consider wage-capping. \"Football is richer today than ever before, but more clubs than ever before are going to the wall,\" announced Keen, as he stood astride his soap-box. \"After nine months of detailed investigation, we have concluded that the financial divide in football between the 'haves' and 'have-nots' must be tackled urgently.\" Indeed. But hands up who thinks MPs will actually do anything about it? * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"The place has been buzzing, the dressing room is on fire\" - New Forest boss Joe Kinnear's not talking literally, is he? * * * * * * * * * * * * CITY SLICKERS WARNING: the following Fiver contains a super-dry financial story involving a) JP McManus and John Magnier, b) some shares in Manchester United, and c) even more uninformed speculation than usual, if that's possible (which it most certainly is). Anyone with aspirations to a life should skip to the Rumour Mill now. Go on, shoo! And yes, that means you Ms Carter. And you too, Professor Chan. For those of you still here, meanwhile, the Fiver is duty bound to report the big City news of the day - the Coolmore Mafia have spent another \u00a320m increasing their shareholding in Manchester United to 28.89%! [Brief interlude to allow readers who stayed on earlier to jump ship. Go on, it's for the best]. The news was confirmed to the stock exchange by Cubic Expression, who this afternoon revealed they had acquired 8m ordinary shares in Manchester United plc, increasing their majority holding to 75,736,960. All this matters, as Footpad Fiver - the Fiver's barrel-bellied, halitosis-inflicted, law-practising cousin - reminds us, because the Coolmore Mafia are now fewer than 2% away from owning so many United shares that they are legally obliged to attempt a take-over. Watch out, Fergie! According to the Fiver's sources, Magnier and McManus are unlikely to go down that route just yet, for fear of further offending United fans [insert 'is that possible?' retort here]. But they do want a far greater say in the running of the club and seats on the board too. And we're betting they're going to get them - despite the attempts of a group calling themselves United 4 Action, who are planning a \"peaceful but vocal\" protest on Cheltenham Gold Cup day. \"We want to get the message across to Magnier and McManus that we want them to sell their shares, and give the club back to the fans,\" explained United 4 Action founder Sean Murphy. Back to the fans, Sean? Surely that battle was lost a long time ago? * * * * * * * * * * * * SOAK UP THE SUN IN DUBAI Our fifth birthday celebration continues, and so do the great prizes.

James Beattie will demand talks with chairman Rupert Lowe if Glenn Hoddle steps within 50 miles of St Mary's. And Franny Jeffers could be on his way to Rangers. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Referees' big cheese Keith Hackett has called for patience while the latest interpretation of the offside rule works its way into the game. Well, you can try, Keith. Thierry Henry has no intention of swapping North London for the Bernabeu. \"Of course it's nice to hear that people talk about you,\" he said. \"But I've made it clear so many times that I'm happy here, that it's about time that people put it in their brain. I'm getting bored now.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV: The Premiership (11.30pm) Congratulations, Fiver reader. Because - judging by the lack of Valentine's Day-woe emails - you've never spent February 14 supping Purple Tin with only Nick Drake for company. Sky Sports 1: Gillette Soccer Special (7pm) Not that we're admitting anything, of course. You're on Sky Sports (10pm) So, in the absence of anything else (apart from emails correcting our spelling of Ashton-Under-Lyne from yesterday), Russell George's disastrous date tale will have to do. FA Cup Classics (12am) \"A lovely Romanian girl at work agreed to meet me for the evening,\" he starts. \"We started in a trendy bar, where pretty quickly she was touching my knee in a friendly manner as we chatted on a sofa. Futbol Mondial (12.30am) \"I was keen.\" Sky Sports 2: Live Spanish Football (8pm) \"She then started talking about how much I earned, and proceeded to ask me to lend her \u00a3500 for her rent. British Eurosport - Live African Nations Cup (6pm) \"Worse followed, as it quickly transpired that the Home Office wanted to deport her back to Transylvania.\" Pay-Per-View: Portsmouth v Chelsea (7pm) \"From then on, the date took on a different, less romantic aspect. I must admit that I felt that I was being somewhat used. Radio 5 Live: Sport On 5 (7pm) \"To make matters worse, she later confessed to being obsessed with Depeche Mode, and was the chairwoman of the Romanian Depeche Mode fan club. Talksport: Football First (7pm) \"I hate Depeche Mode.\" Newstalk 106 (www.newstalk106.ie): Off The Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) Hmmm. It's not bad, but there's got to be better out there.
