The executive producer of the now-axed Jeremy Kyle Show said its host \u201cstrongly believed\u201d in the results of lie detector tests that were a staple of the programme, while admitting that people who failed tests could have been telling the truth. Tom McLennan told the Commons culture select committee\u2019s inquiry into the treatment of reality show participants that he did not know how reliable the results of the tests were, and he said guests were told they were \u201cnot 100% accurate\u201d. Graham Stanier, director of aftercare for guests on the show, said: \u201cSome will fail the test but be telling the truth. They do become distressed because they disagree with the result.\u201d Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, said: \u201c[The results] are presented as fact. If you can\u2019t say what the range of the accuracy of the tests is, that is irresponsible.\u201d Last month ITV cancelled the programme after 14 years following the death of a guest, Steve Dymond. The results of a lie detector test on the show had supposedly shown he was cheating on his fiancee. \u201cJeremy did have a strong opinion about the lie detector,\u201d McLennan said. \u201cJeremy has very strong views. To my understanding, he strongly believed in the tests.\u201d Kyle refused to appear to face questions from the committee over Dymond\u2019s death. MPs rounded on the six ITV executives who did appear, accusing the broadcaster of seeking to exploit vulnerable people. \u201cYou\u2019re picking on members of the general public,\u201d said Giles Watling, a Tory MP and former actor whose credits include the TV series Bread. \u201c[You\u2019re] tear[ing] them apart in public, which is part of the entertainment in a sort of Roman Colosseum-type way.\u201d The Labour MP Paul Farrelly likened ITV\u2019s duty of care procedures to \u201cputting people on a stretcher\u201d after they had been exploited on screen. ITV defended the Jeremy Kyle Show, saying 20,000 guests had appeared in 3,000 episodes, only seven had ever lodged an official complaint to Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, and none of those complaints had been upheld. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the word exploit,\u201d McLennan said. \u201cEveryone was completely fully informed of [what to expect] on the show; 99% of people who came on the show were regular viewers.\u201d ITV\u2019s chief executive, Carolyn McCall, who has beefed up its duty of care policies for the latest intake of Love Island contestants, said the two examiners used to carry out lie detector tests claimed their accuracy was \u201cin the 90s [per cent]\u201d. However, she said ITV would not make a similar show using lie detector tests in the future. \u201cJeremy Kyle, he knew they were not 100% accurate,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are right to say that on occasion he would say: \u2018This test says you are lying.\u2019 He would use that. That was his style. Everybody who watched the show and people who went on the show knew what his style was. This show at its core was trying very much to resolve people\u2019s issues.\u201d ITV was also taken to task over the accusations of portraying unrealistic body image standards with contestants on Love Island. \u201cThey are all fit, healthy, young individuals because it is a dating show,\u201d McCall said. \u201cIt is not I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out Of Here! which is a range of celebs in all shapes and sizes. [On Love Island] they are all with the healthy range of body mass index or above.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
