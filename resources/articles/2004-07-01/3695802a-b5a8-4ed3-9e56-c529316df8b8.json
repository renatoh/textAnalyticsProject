They will probably be doing the same even on Mars today. Yet while Greece celebrates wildly, far from everyone will share its delight. Greece's remarkable journey to the European Championship final is one of football's great stories and worthy of the utmost respect. It may have been possible to get shorter odds on Sven-Goran Eriksson streaking at this tournament than Greece being around for the denouement. Yet most neutrals would have preferred to see the Czech Republic take on Portugal on Sunday. Where the Czechs have provided plenty of exciting attacking at this tournament, the Greeks' success has been far less attractive. It can be taken for granted that the canny Rehhagel will set out first and foremost to neutralise Portugal, just as he did so well with the Czechs last night. This final may be one for the romantic but it is hardly one for the purist. Portugal, having lost to Greece in the opening game, realise all too well that their opponents know how to make life hard. Good organisation and stout defending have been the basis of Greece's fairy tale, which has seen them beat Portugal, France and now the Czech Republic. Results are everything. Entertainment is hardly a priority. The Greeks make no secret of their game plan, which last night included detailing a defender to neutralise Milan Baros, sitting deep and throwing few players into attack. \"I believe we played very cleverly,\" said the match-winner Traianos Dellas. \"We shut all their avenues and their strong points. Sometimes we were freezing their game and that's why we did it.\" Rehhagel was equally honest. \"During our meeting before the match we were trying to find the way to make this night a very difficult one for the Czech team,\" he said. \"I made certain decisions. These decisions have been followed by the players. I only advise the players and we have great results.\" If it is harder to warm to Greece than admire them, Rehhagel deserves immense credit for getting the best from his resources. Greece looked a low-quality team and the German knows his players need to be focused on defence to have the best chance of defeating more illustrious opponents. A goal for his team seemed to be regarded as a bonus. Rehhagel had thought through his tactics carefully. Most notably, he asked Giourkas Seitaridis to keep an eye on Baros, whose five goals from the previous four games made him an obvious danger. Seitaridis, nominally the right-back, followed Baros all over the field when it was appropriate, popping up in the centre and out on the left. With Mihalis Kapsis rarely far from Jan Koller and the midfield staying deep and harrying people, Greece had a well-rehearsed plan for keeping Czech chances to a minimum. Broadly speaking it worked after a difficult opening during which Tomas Rosicky hit the bar. The Greece goalkeeper Antonis Nikopolidis had only one save to make from the sixth minute, though Baros and Koller wasted chances by shooting wide. With Baros taken care of by Seitaridis and Koller looked after by Kapsis, Greece had Dellas as a spare central defender to tidy up any problems. With their own attacking they provided few of those for the Czechs until extra-time when they twice went close before Dellas scored. They looked to get the ball forward quickly but too often their passes were inaccurate or easily cleaned up. Only a couple of crosses threatened to produce anything during normal time. \"They passed the ball better,\" Rehhagel said of the Czechs, \"but that's the way it is. Sometimes the best team does not win.\" \"They're very hard to play,\" said the Czech coach Karel Bruckner. \"I saw them against Spain, France and Portugal. I suppose we had the most chances from these matches but they played very well. They play very effective football and they are capable of playing like that in the final.\" That is why Greece's achievements will be admired but not celebrated worldwide."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
