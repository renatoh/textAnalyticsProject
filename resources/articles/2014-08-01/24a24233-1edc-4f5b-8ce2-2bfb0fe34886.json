Some will have known that Prince Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria, is the colloquial term for a male genital piercing. Others will have been motivated to look it up. Either way, they will have been more clued up at the end than at the beginning. This glimpse of urban slang was brought to them by Peter Souter, boss of TBWA, the ad agency involved in the launch. Perhaps unsure of his surroundings, he erroneously welcomed those present to the Prince Albert Room. But, fear not, he told them: \u201cI haven\u2019t got a Prince Albert.\u201d There were gasps around the room. Even Richard Desmond, the man who brought you Asian Babes and Television X and provides the hardcore organ that is the Daily Express, looked taken aback. And he doesn\u2019t shock easily. \u2022 Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s pugilist in chief, is in the wars again. After swishing blows at Tony Blair and Rupert Murdoch, he aims a straight right at the Tories, in the form of flagship Westminster council. \u201cI was on an estate in Pimlico the other day,\u201d he tells the Catholic Herald. \u201cThey\u2019re doing some redevelopment, and it means knocking down an old peoples\u2019 home. But it\u2019s all right, says Westminster council, because they\u2019re going to rebuild it on the site of the playground for the local school. And when they were asked where the kids would play, the council said they\u2019d persuaded the developers to build a new playground \u2026 underground.\u201d Can this be true, we asked Westminster. Not quite, it said. But an underground playground was indeed part of a now-paused consultation. More a stiff jab than a knockout blow, then. Nevertheless, expect Watson to keep thrashing away. \u2022 Off to the Clacton byelection in Essex, following the defection of sitting Tory MP Douglas Carswell to Ukip. No surprises expected, given that Carswell previously agitated for a pact between the Conservatives and Ukip. One can safely assume that the talk will be Europe, Europe, Europe. But then it was ever thus. Labour\u2019s David Winnick will be there to assist his party\u2019s effort. The long-standing MP for Walsall North knows the lie of the land, having fought Harwich \u2013 when it included Clacton \u2013 in 1964. \u201cOne of the big issues even then was whether we should join the Common Market. I was opposed at the time,\u201d he tells us. Eras may change, but preoccupations stay the same. Devoutly Eurosceptic Carswell wasn\u2019t even born for another seven years. \u2022 Meanwhile, it\u2019s not that Labour is rattled by Alistair Darling\u2019s faltering performance in this week\u2019s debate with Alex Salmond. It\u2019s just that at this late stage, with the polls tightening and the wind at the SNP\u2019s back, officials think the no campaign could do with a bit of help. To that end, Labour has launched a prize draw \u2013 open to party members, tickets \u00a32, first prize \u00a31,000 or a luxury Scottish holiday for two. Might require a passport come October, mind you. \u2022 And while deliberations continue about Scotland\u2019s big decision, a warning in Business Insider magazine: \u201cWhy Independence Could Put Scotland In Danger Of Russian Invasion\u201d is the spectre raised. \u201cPut simply, the Russians sail their submarines into Scottish waters on a regular basis. Russian vessels approach Scottish waters about once or twice a year, close enough to require the Royal Navy to perform counter-manoeuvres.\u201d Who knows what Putin will do next. \u201cRussia has a recent history of military adventurism, in the Ukraine. Although there is absolutely no reason for Russia to invade Scotland, the departure of Trident from northern waters could \u2013 in theory \u2013 let the Russians do whatever they like up there.\u201d Alistair Darling didn\u2019t even mention that. D\u2019oh! \u2022 Finally, news that Scotland has the highest percentage of redheads in the world brings to mind, inevitably perhaps, the observation of the late, great Chic Murray. \u201cMy girlfriend\u2019s a redhead,\u201d said Chic. \u201cNo hair, but a red head.\u201d Would that he were around to lift the referendum debate.
