Mr Hall, who lost out to Richard Wallace in the race for the Mirror editor's job last year, left the company last night. A spokesman for Trinity Mirror said Mr Hall's job was \"likely to become redundant\" and that he had \"entered into a period of consultation with the company\". He is not thought to have another job to go to. \"I would like to thank Phil for his contribution to the business over the past two years,\" said Ellis Watson, the managing director of the group's national division. \"He has been instrumental in establishing the magazines unit and recruiting its talented team of journalists, as well as overseeing the successful launches of We Love Telly!, Celebs on Sunday and Take It Easy for our national titles.\" The decision comes three months after the Mirror's 3am magazine folded. The supplement failed to hit advertising targets and was axed after less than a year. 3am, an offshoot of the paper's successful gossip column of the same name, launched in a flurry of publicity last February. At the time the Trinity Mirror chief executive, Sly Bailey, announced ambitious plans to take on Heat and OK! with a new magazine division. The Mirror had hoped to cash in on the booming celebrity market, where Emap's Heat and Closer, IPC's Now and Richard Desmond's New are battling for young, female-dominated readers. Hall quit his job as head of the Press Association's contract publishing arm in January 2003 to join Trinity Mirror as the editorial development director. He edited the News of the World for five years before leaving in 2000 to make way for Rebekah Wade. Hall became the editor of Hello! in January 2001 and helped land a number of scoops, including the rights to Victoria Beckham's official autobiography, Learning to Fly. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
