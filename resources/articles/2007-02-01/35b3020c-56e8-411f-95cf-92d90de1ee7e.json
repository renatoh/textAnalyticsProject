The record is not clear, but there is no doubt that Webber's arguments about freedom of choice and ease of movement were extremely influential. He and Richard Llewelyn-Davies, the Labour peer and leader of the Milton Keynes planning team (who died in 1981), were both convinced that, in designing a future city, as much as possible should be left undetermined. These convictions led eventually, and after much debate, to the rejection of a plan based on public transport. In this, Milton Keynes, designated a new town 40 years ago in January 1967, would have been built as a series of high density neighbourhoods strung, like a string of pearls, along a monorail. As concerns about climate change grow and doubts increase about the practicality of car-based living, the idea of a city with free public transport a few minutes' walk from every front door seems persuasive. (Residents would have paid for the monorail, as tenants pay for lifts in a skyscraper, from rates or rents.) Would it have worked? The arguments against such an architectural tour de force were that it would have been inflexible. Webber was born in Hartford, Connecticut, and grew up on the coast in New Haven. After a BA (1947) and MA (1948) in both sociology and economics at the University of Texas, he moved to the University of California at Berkeley, where he took a master's in city planning (1952), wrote the papers that established his reputation as an original and visionary thinker, and stayed for the rest of his life. He joined the department of city and regional planning in 1956, and ended his career as director of the University of California Transportation Centre, continuing for six years after his formal retirement in 1990. In the 1950s, he had worked on the feasibility studies for the Bay Area Rapid Transit System (Bart), but after this first new US heavy rail transit system for decades had been built, he criticised it as \"an honest mistake\". The large-scale study he initiated when he became the director of the university's institute of urban and regional development in 1970 argued for a more flexible, cost-effective transport system, though he softened his criticism as Bart's usage increased. His overall approach is summed up by the title of his paper Order in Diversity: Community without Propinquity (1963). In it he was examining, and finding not to be wanting, the seemingly amorphous, repetitious sprawl characteristic of the booming, postwar American metropolis. In The Urban Place and the Non-place Urban Realm (1965), he argued that automobility, freedom to choose and have access to whatever the modern city offered, were more important to people than the provision of distinctive \"urban\" places that are the essence of architecture. In the debate between architects and their critics that continues to this day, Webber's starting point was that living is not as it was. If the 19th century was characterised by village life for those working on the land and by a circumscribed mill-and-cottages existence for those working in industrial cities, that was history. Modern living, as Webber himself lived it at Berkeley, was all about spacious suburban houses, telephoning colleagues all over the US, and effortless driving on the spanking new freeways that crisscrossed Los Angeles and the Bay area. The awkward truth which Webber put his finger on is that for millions of people, life is about a home in the suburbs and driving a car. As Webber wrote in Order in Diversity: \"By now almost everyone knows that low density developments on the growing edge of the metropolis are a form of 'cancerous growth', scornfully dubbed with the most denunciatory of our new lexicon's titles, 'urban sprawl', 'scatterisation', 'subtopia', and now 'slurbs' - a pattern of development that 'threatens our national heritage of open space'...\" Yet, as sociologist Herbert Gans was to show in his book The Levittowners, an account of the \"ways of life and politics in a new suburban community\", the people who live in the \"sprawl\" like it. Is there any doubt that this is equally true today? And yet, as concerns mount about global warming, as London's economy continues to draw thousands from abroad, and as the \"concreting-over\" of England from Portsmouth to Peterborough seems to some almost a fait accompli, small wonder solutions are sought in high-density living. Happily, the \"urban renaissance\", for which Richard Rogers campaigns so eloquently, is happening from Tyneside to Bristol and from Liverpool to London. Young people are moving into the flats and lofts being created on every available urban quayside - even if they subsequently, and subversively, move to the suburbs. Does this mean that Webber's insights are now obsolete? His fear was that too many architects and planners were caught up in \"an ideological campaign to reconstruct the preconceived city forms that matched the social structures of past eras\". His goal was a metropolis devoted to easy human interaction within a spatial form dictated by how people want to live. Monorail MK, had it been built, might have thrown light on this issue. Imagine it in 1970s architecture with lots of trendy exposed concrete, slab-like blocks of low-ceilinged flats, and houses with yards kept small so as to squeeze lots of them within a five-minute walk of the stations. The transport problems of LA and MK may remain to be solved, but as we contemplate a city composed mostly of pink brick houses and gardens, may we not owe more than we think to Berkeley's visionary professor of city and regional planning? He is survived by his wife, Carolyn (n\u00e9e Cott), two daughters, Jane and Martha, and a son, Thomas. \u00b7 Melvin Webber, town planner, born May 6 1920; died November 25 2006"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
