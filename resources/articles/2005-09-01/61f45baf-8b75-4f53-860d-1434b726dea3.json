An acrimonious split between the leaders of the \"orange revolution\" forced Mr Yushchenko to sack his former ally, Yulia Timoshenko, and her government earlier this month. The opposition rallied to reject his proposed replacement, Yuri Yekhanurov. Mr Yekhanurov got 223 votes, three less than needed. Five criminal cases stemming from the accusations of corruption that triggered the crisis have been opened against officials."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
