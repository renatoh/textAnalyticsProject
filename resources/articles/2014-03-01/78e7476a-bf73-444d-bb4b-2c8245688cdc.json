Thanks for your time and your eyes and your attention and your emails. I\u2019ll be back on Thursday for England\u2019s attempt at some kind of consolation. Til then, then \u2013 bye! That was awesome hitting from Sammy at the end. Those two attempted yorkers weren\u2019t disastrous deliveries, but Sammy had his eye in there. The second 19th-over six in particular was obscene, thundered away with little height and maximum power to all but seal victory. With three overs to go the game was on a knife-edge, but Sammy won it with a nine-ball 30, featuring two fours and three sixes, and then hailed the \u201cteam effort\u201d. \u201cIn T20 cricket the momentum of the game shifts, we just make sure we start well and we finish well. In both games we started well and finished well,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re looking good and we just have to keep playing that way. All in all, we\u2019re building towards the World Cup and so far it looks good. Come Thursday we\u2019ll be going all out for 3-0 to give us a good send-off before we go out to Bangladesh.\u201d Bresnan bowls the penultimate over, and after two singles an attempted yorker lands a foot short and Sammy thwacks it down the ground for six. Two balls later he tries it again, lands it fractionally short again, and the ball is despatched for six again. Two brilliant strikes, and Sammy then powers the fifth ball of the over past backward point for four to win it! 18.5 overs: West Indies 155-5 (Sammy 30, Bravo 8) Dernbach returns for the crucial final overs, and Sammy takes a swing at his second delivery and gets a top edge that sends the ball over Buttler\u2019s head and away for four. There follows one lovely yorker, and then one much less lovely yorker \u2013 Dernbach gets the length wrong, it turns into a full toss and Sammy smacks it away for six. 14 off the over. West Indies need 17 from 12. Bresnan\u2019s first ball is very nicely cut away by Bravo through third man for four. Useless delivery though, short and wide. England were 125-4 at the end of over 17; West Indies need 31 from 18 balls. That\u2019s another for Bresnan, who\u2019s on a hat-trick! Bresnan swings big but doesn\u2019t control his bat and Hales at long on is called into action again \u2013 a simpler catch this time. This is still anyone\u2019s game! Samuels tries to hit down the ground, but it\u2019s a half-hearted shot hit at an awkward height, and Hales out in the deep catches low and well at long on. Bopara returns to bowl his final over after a change of ends, and three singles come off it. His four overs end, with 10 runs coming off them. Very good stuff. The massive megablows have not gone. Wright\u2019s first delivery is hammered down the ground by Samuels for another six, and then the second goes for four. It\u2019s really quite the all-action over, featuring as it does a wicket, a four, a six and three singles. Simmons gets a fine top-edge and the ball just flies into Buttler\u2019s glove and refuses to leave. The massive megablows have gone, with West Indies presumably happy to leave themselves with wickets in hands and a non-ludicrous run rate. Four singles off Parry\u2019s second over. Luke Wright introduces himself with a slow full toss, from which Simmons scores just the one. The highlight of the over is Tredwell\u2019s excellent one-handed diving southpaw stop at third man, which denies Samuels three runs. Simmons cuts the next delivery for four. Stephen Parry bowls his first ever international Twenty20 over, and West Indies help themselves to 13 runs, including back-to-back boundaries from Simmons, the first cut through backward point, and the second cut a little finer through third man. Two runs and a wicket from Bopara\u2019s over \u2013 his 18 deliveries thus far have gone for a meagre 17 runs. Bopara gets Gayle, who tries to prod the ball to mid-on but only chops onto the stumps. Tredwell is just two deliveries from departing, head held high, having restrained West Indies beautifully over his last three overs. Then Gayle slammed the ball over long on and onto the top of the roof \u2013 another couple of feet and that was out of the ground too. In all, Tredwell\u2019s four overs went for 27, including a four and three sixes. England\u2019s comeback continues, with four singles, the last of which \u2013 pulled by Gayle \u2013 landed a couple of feet short of Morgan at mid on, with Bopara plaintively screeching at him to \u201ccatch! caaaaaaaatttttccchhhhhhh!\u201d . A fine, tight over from Tredwell who, since Gayle smacked him for six at the start of over six, has bowled 11 deliveries and conceded three runs. Bopara comes on, and starts with five dot balls to Samuels, followed by a single that keeps Gayle off strike for the start of over eight. Gayle pulls Tredwell\u2019s first delivery way over midwicket for another six, but that is the extent of the scoring, and there\u2019s even a little lbw appeal off the last, which nobody seems particularly convinced about. Dernbach returns after a change of ends, and Smith cleverly dabs the ball past Buttler for four, before getting out. The bowler celebrates the wicket with one vicious fist-pump and a very loud and apparently quite angry scream. West Indies reached their 50 off 29 balls, 26 fewer than England. Smith tries to clip the ball through midwicket but gets a leading edge and Bresnan at cover takes the catch. Tredwell comes on, and his first over features four dot balls. That\u2019s the good news, from England\u2019s perspective. The bad news is that the other two went for four and another massive six, into the top balcony of the media centre. Smith top-edges an attempted hoik down the ground, and it flies over first slip for another six. And then Bresnan\u2019s last ball is popped over midwicket, with no violence whatsoever, just a short backswing and some timing, for another six. After three overs England were 15-1. In between the end of the first over and the start of the second Lumb receives treatment to his knee \u2013 hit by the ball from the fifth ball of that first over \u2013 before limping off. As for Dernbach\u2019s over, it features two singles, three dots, and a last-ball pull over \u2013 waaaaay over \u2013 midwicket from Gayle that sent the ball clean out the ground. See ya! Bresnan bowls the first delivery, and this time it doesn\u2019t go for six. Or, indeed, anything. Smith swishes and misses, and then pokes the next straight to the nearest fielder. Then he goes big, but doesn\u2019t get enough on it \u2013 the ball flies high but is never going to reach the boundary, and Lumb sprints out from mid on but doesn\u2019t quite make it in time. That\u2019s a let-off, but the last three deliveries of the over go for four, and nothing, and \u2013 from a hapless shortish delivery \u2013 six. An acceptable total given the dismal start made by England, with Buttler the obvious star with the bat, and Santokie, with four wickets and 21 runs coming from his four overs, the pick of the bowlers. Now it\u2019s down to England\u2019s spinners, who will either frustrate West Indies, or be viciously flayed around the ground. Time will tell. Wright gets a single off the first, and Bresnan clobbers the second over long on for six, and that\u2019s England\u2019s 150, achieved with four deliveries to spare. The first of them goes for a single, and the second \u2013 much slower from Bravo \u2013 is missed entirely by Wright. Another single brings Bresnan on strike for the final delivery, which doesn\u2019t go particularly well. The last delivery of the innings, and Bresnan has a big swish and gets a slight nick through to Ramdin. In between the wickets Wright hits his first ball down the ground for four, making this his best innings for quite a while. England are going for big shots and not landing them. Santokie gives another batsman a bit of rope, and he duly hangs himself. Bravo collects at extra cover. Buttler swings his bat, gets a thick top edge and the ball loops down to third man, where Sammy collects. The mean successful score in the history of international Twenty20 cricket is precisely 150, and England could yet reach it, which given how they started and the recent rain break isn\u2019t bad going. This hadn\u2019t been one of those \u2013 the clouds seeming to have settled over the batsmen since it stopped raining \u2013 until Buttler slammed Bravo\u2019s final delivery down the ground for six. Good discipline of line and variety of pace from Russell restricts England to a few singles, until a last-ball full-toss is boshed back over his head for a one-bounce boundary. Bravo\u2019s second over starts with a slower delivery which Bopara deals with very nicely, waiting and then clipping the ball through midwicket for four. It ends with another slower delivery that Bopara doesn\u2019t deal with quite so well, and it bounces through to Ramdin. In between there are four singles. That was Andre Russell\u2019s first over, split in the middle by a lengthy rain break. It started, way back when, with Bopara cutting his first ball and the chap at backward point letting it run through his fingers. What with the dropped catches, this hasn\u2019t so far been a classic display of fielding. By its end, Buttler has secured his half-century, from 33 balls. The players are back out. England have five and a half overs to go. Game (back) on. The latest from Mike Selvey \u2013 you\u2019ve got time to make yourself a cuppa and then we\u2019ll be back in action\u2026 Here are the covers. Catch \u2018em while you can \u2013 they are currently being removed. \u201cNick Knight says they\u2019re currently experiencing \u2018light mizzly stuff\u2019?\u201d trills Robin Hazlehurst. \u201cYou mean Dernbach is bowling already?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in Kingston for A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream in which a man turns into a donkey overnight,\u201d writes Gary Naylor. \u201cThat Shakey even knew a bit about cricket.\u201d So who\u2019s our Bottom, then? I\u2019m back, but action is not. Nick Knight says they\u2019re currently experiencing \u201clight mizzly stuff\u201d. The skies have cleared, but there\u2019s no sign of action yet. I\u2019m going to attempt a quick sandwich run. Back in five. Frankly, I\u2019m terrified. Replace the cricket bat with a machete or a scythe or something and I\u2019d be running in the other direction as fast as I possibly could. Which isn\u2019t very fast, to be fair. Here\u2019s a live picture from Barbados. Dark clouds, light clouds and blue skies in what adds up to a fairly confused sky. The ground staff don their yellow parkas once again, and with a big fat raincloud hovering directly over the ground the covers come on. Doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ll hang around very long. Dwayne Bravo does some bowling, and a couple of singles tick England into triple figures \u2013 their first 50 took them 55 balls, and their second just 25. But then Buttler misjudges a slower delivery and sends the ball into the skies, Bravo demands the right to catch it, and then doesn\u2019t. And immediately Hales clips the ball high to midwicket, who collects a straightforward catch at chest height. Buttler gets dropped, and then the very next ball Hales doesn\u2019t! England have a half-decent partnership happening here, Hales with the latest evidence, pulling Rampaul over midwicket for six, before Buttler goes down the ground for another. In between an attempted repeat from Hales falls a couple of feet short of Smith. Sammy\u2019s first delivery is fair dismissed past long on for four by Buttler. Then a couple of balls later Hales cuts only for Gayle, diving from gully, to damn near catch the thing left-handed. That allows the batsmen to run a single and returns Buttler to strike, where he hits four and then a ramped six. Rampaul continues, but the boundaries do not. Four runs are patiently accumulated, one at a time. Buttler claims a single off the first ball, and England finally reach their half-century, with the aid of four boundaries and nerry a six. At which Hales starts flexing his muscles, very nearly gets four through point and then slaps the ball over midwicket for that long-awaited six. Ravi Rampaul replaces Badree, and Buttler top-edges his first ball over Ramdin \u2013 way over Ramdin \u2013 and away for a one-bounce four. And then a comedy drop! Buttler goes big again, really big. Ramdin calls for the ball, loses it against the grey skies, misjudges the wind a bit, and then suddenly realises he\u2019s messed up horribly and dives backwards in a vain attempt to get so much as a slight touch of the ball on its way groundwards. Marlon Samuels comes on, and Buttler drives the first ball through extra cover for four \u2013 though it took a few replays to be sure that Santokie hadn\u2019t cut it off with his left foot on the rope. In social media news, Twitter\u2019s playing up and Mike Selvey is having to communicate with me using the old-fashioned medium of emails. Eng won a World T20 on this ground not least through not trying to hit the ball into the wind. Now Lumb in the first game, and now Morgan do precisely that and are caught on the boundary. This is scratchy, scrappy stuff from England, who can\u2019t afford to lose any more wickets, but need to score runs fast, and at the moment are very much prioritising the first imperative over the second. Badree\u2019s four overs have gone for a meagre 16. I think it\u2019s probably fair to say that this isn\u2019t where England had planned to be at this stage. Santokie continues, and England score a few singles, and Hales could have gone again off the final ball, inside-edging into the ground and just past the stumps. The wicket came off the last ball of the over. The first had brought a pretty decent lbw shout against Hales \u2013 very decent indeed: HawkEye suggests the ball would have clunked into leg stump. Oh deary dear. Morgan decides that a boundary would be nice, tries a sweep and top-edges the ball high into the air, and down into Simmons\u2019 hands. The first ball flicks off Ali and trundles just past Ramdin for two leg byes, well fielded a foot from the rope, and then Ali flicks the second over square leg for four. That was all very good, but then he got himself out off the third. Another slower ball, which a befuddled Ali doesn\u2019t know what to do with, so he opts not to do anything at all. Bad decision. Badree\u2019s second over goes for just the two, shared between the batsmen. And here\u2019s a special treat \u2013 another song that mentions Barbados! Krishmar Santokie bowls, and Hales slashes the ball square, where it lands just short of Smith at backward point. No wicket then, but one wasn\u2019t long in coming. I\u2019m not convinced that there was an edge, and perhaps Lumb was angry only with himself. Meanwhile, the groundstaff don bright yellow hooded parkas \u2013 clearly there\u2019s something in them clouds. A slower ball, and Lumb thinks he got an edge to the ball before it clipped his pads, but the umpire disagrees! Samuel Badree gets things started, and Hales gets the day\u2019s first boundary, cutting away the third delivery, and the first that wouldn\u2019t have gone on to hit the stumps. The rest come in ones and twos. The players are out, and we are braced for cricket. Here\u2019s Mike Selvey\u2019s Twitter-based brief teamly update: West Indies Dwayne Smith, Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Bravo, Denesh Ramdin, Darren Sammy, Ravi Rampaul, Samuel Badree, Krishmar Santokie England Alex Hales, Michael Lumb, Moeen Ali, Eoin Morgan, Joe Buttler, Ravi Bopara, Luke Wright, Tim Bresnan, James Tredwell, Stephen Parry, Jade Dernbach You\u2019ll spot that England have brought in Parry and Ali, and dumped out Broad and Stokes. A letter from Mike Selvey in Barbados: Dear OBOers Sarah ran her half marathon on Sunday in aid of AMMF, the single charity that raises money for research into cholangiocarcinoma, which claimed her brother almost a year ago. Thanks in no small part to the generosity of OBOers she has so far raised \u00a33,507.04, which is incredible. Despite a series of injuries she ran 2h 1m, and Hannah, our 17 yr old daughter did 1h 52m. Anyway, this from Sarah : A huge thank you to everyone who donated to my JustGiving page, raising vital funds to research this devastating cancer which claimed my brother\u2019s life just under a year ago. On race day, the sun shone (a bit too much) &amp; your generosity truly inspired me to the finish, THANKYOU And a final link to her JustGiving page: https://www.justgiving.com/Sarah-Selvey1 Thanks so much again to everyone. Best wishes Selve England won the toss, and will bat. So, it\u2019s another must-win game. Of course, it\u2019s only a must-win game if you\u2019re happy with a very loose definition of the word \u201cmust\u201d. But it\u2019s a would-quite-like-to-win game, that\u2019s for sure. A defeat in the first match of a limited-overs series is a not entirely unfamiliar situation \u2013 four of their last five Twenty20 series of three matches or more have started with defeat, as well as three of their last five ODI series of a similar length (one of the others having started with an abandonment, and then defeat in match two). So they have to win today to have any chance of a series victory and the pre-Twenty20 world megabash morale boost that would come with it. Now, with the toss rapidly approaching, here are your all-important just-how-important-is-winning-the-toss-anyway statistics. The answer: quite a lot if you\u2019re from West Indies, less if you\u2019re from England, a very great deal if you\u2019re from Australia or Pakistan, while if you\u2019re Indian it\u2019s a veritable disaster. Here are the percentages of games won after losing and winning the toss before Twenty20 internationals: \ufeffIndia | lost toss: 68.4% | won toss: 46.2% Sri Lanka | lost toss 60% | won toss 62.5% Pakistan | lost toss 55.6% | won toss 64.3% South Africa | lost toss 58.8% | won toss 67.9% England | lost toss 51.4% | won toss 48.1% New Zealand | lost toss 46.9% | won toss 45.9% Australia | lost toss 45.7% | won toss 58.1% West Indies | lost toss 39.1% | won toss 50% Songs that mention Barbados dept It may well be that you never forgive me for what I am about to inflict upon you.
