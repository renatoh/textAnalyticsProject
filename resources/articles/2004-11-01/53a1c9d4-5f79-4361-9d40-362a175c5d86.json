Fifty French armoured vehicles manned by armed soldiers were assembled around the residence of President Laurent Gbagbo in the main city, Abidjan, and barbed wire was thrown around their positions. Mr Gbagbo's supporters then attempted to form a human shield between his residence and the French troops. French officials said their forces were securing the upmarket Hotel Ivoire, about 200 metres from the presidential mansion, as a gathering point for the possible evacuation of French nationals. Nearly 2,000 foreign nationals were sheltering in French and UN bases in Abidjan, many plucked to safety on Sunday by French helicopters as armed mobs looted their homes. French troops also took control of the international airport and strategic bridges in the city. In Paris, President Jacques Chirac flatly denied that the French soldiers had assembled to take over the presidential mansion. Mr Chirac said yesterday that French troops in Ivory Coast were acting \"with the sole objective\" of guaranteeing the safety of the 10,000-12,000 French citizens in the country. He said France was a \"friend\" and hoped Ivory Coast would \"return to the path of national reconciliation\". But Ivorian state radio claimed that the French army planned an assault on the president and urged residents to come out on the streets to protect their head of state. A presidential spokesman, D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Tagro, said the French army action frightened the population. \"Their presence here is scaring people. They're crying and they think that President Gbagbo is going to be overthrown,\" Mr Tagro told Associated Press. The French troops fired into the air yesterday afternoon to disperse the president's supporters. Ivory Coast's army chief of staff, General Mathias Doue, tried to defuse the situation by meeting French officers at their base in the Hotel Ivoire. Both the hotel and the presidential palace are in the upmarket Cocoby neighbourhood, separated by a lagoon from the busy city centre. But even as the officials were in discussions, French helicopters clattered over Abidjan and gunfire and thudding explosions could be heard elsewhere in the city centre. The unrest caused the price of cocoa - of which Ivory Coast produces 45% of the world's total - to rise by 12% on international markets yesterday. \"It is very tense, very volatile,\" a British embassy official said yesterday afternoon. \"Things could turn violent at any moment.\" Most of Abidjan's embassies and main stores were closed yesterday. Thousands responded to the state broadcasts which appealed to people to fill the streets around the president's home. They chanted angry anti-French statements. \"The whites don't like the blacks, but we don't care!\" mobs yelled. \"Ivory Coast is a sovereign state,\" declared placards waved by the protesters. Yesterday's standoff in front of the presidential residence followed the weekend attack by Ivorian forces on French troops and the French counterattack which destroyed the planes of the Ivorian air force. On Saturday Ivory Coast's forces launched a surprise airstrike on a French peacekeeping post which killed nine French soldiers and one American. France has about 4,000 peacekeepers in Ivory Coast. The United Nations has about 6,000, in a buffer zone between rebel north and government south. The bodies of the nine French soldiers were flown home yesterday, along with 34 injured. France swiftly retaliated for the deaths of its soldiers. Late on Saturday the French armed helicopters bombed and destroyed all the aircraft of the fledgling Ivorian air force. Two Russian-made Sukhoi 25 warplanes and five helicopters were destroyed on the ground in Abidjan and the capital, Yamoussoukro. Speaking in Paris yesterday, Mr Chirac said the UN security council had unanimously approved his decision to destroy the aircraft. The destruction of the planes sparked riots across Abidjan and other cities. Tens of thousands of residents rampaged through the streets, attacking and looting French-owned shops and houses. Although several foreigners were attacked and beaten, so far no deaths have been reported. The South African president, Thabo Mbeki, was preparing to fly to Ivory Coast today as the head of a mission by the African Union to try to find a mediated solution. Mr Mbeki was consulting west African leaders in preparation for his trip, a foreign affairs spokesman said in Pretoria."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
