Over the coming months, thousands of parents will be waving off their kids as they head off on holiday with friends or go travelling. But don\u2019t let them make the mistake of using high-charging UK bank cards when they arrive. Make a load of shop purchases and a handful of ATM withdrawals in Spain or further afield using some debit and credit cards, and the charges could easily add up to more than the cost of a cheap flight. It\u2019s much better to arm them \u2013 or yourself \u2013 with a card that won\u2019t charge \u00a32 every time you wave and pay, or cost more than \u00a39 to take out the equivalent of \u00a3200 from a cash machine. The obvious solution for young people \u2013 or anyone with standard bank cards \u2013 is a prepaid travel money card. They are quick and easy to get hold of \u2013 there are no credit checks \u2013 and once you have loaded them up from your UK bank account at a typical currency conversion fee of 1%-2%, they can be used abroad just like any other bank card \u2013 but (mostly) without hefty charges. Guardian Money has spent this week trawling the market and come up with the best value cards. The three standout cards, in our view, are Caxton FX Black, Sainsbury\u2019s Bank Cash Passport and WeSwap. All will let you load multiple currencies \u2013 up to 18 in the case of WeSwap \u2013 and each allows you to make fee-free purchases in shops, and free ATM withdrawals \u2013 provided you are getting out the currency you have loaded on. Website MoneySavingExpert claims WeSwap offers the lowest currency conversion fee \u2013 charged as you swap your pounds into the currency of your choice. It can be as low as 1%, provided you make the transfer at least a week before using it. You have to take out a minimum of \u00a3200 to get fee-free ATM withdrawals. The others don\u2019t have this restriction. All three are Mastercards, meaning they should be widely accepted. In each case, the card is free, and there are no fees to reload cash \u2013 which is typically done online or via a mobile phone app. Each card allows the user to move money between the currencies held, at the prevailing rate that day. It is important to choose the card that holds the currency of the places you are visiting. Bank card expert Andrew Hagger, who runs MoneyComms, says: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely worth applying for your cards a few weeks in advance so the traveller and their parents are comfortable with how they work and how to top them up. \u201cBoth the parents and the traveller should make a note on their phone of the 24/7 assistance telephone number in case there are any issues or the card is lost.\u201d He says both Caxton and Sainsbury\u2019s will issue a second card for free in the event that the first is lost. WeSwap charges \u00a34.95. Users should be aware that prepaid cards aren\u2019t suitable when hiring a car, as most car hire companies will require a credit card to cover the excess deposit. And don\u2019t just forget about the card when you return home, warns Hagger, as some cards impose a fee if it isn\u2019t used. Caxton can charge \u00a32 a month if an account hasn\u2019t been used for over two years, and Sainsbury\u2019s cardholders pay \u00a32 a month after 18 months of inactivity. Don\u2019t use these cards in the UK, as charges can apply. So, which card? WeSwap may be the cheapest, and it certainly looks good, but overall the Caxton card would be our first choice, not least because it is long established. The Sainsbury\u2019s card can be delivered to your local store, making it a good last-minute choice, and it is easy to get back the balance post-trip. Lastly, if the parent has a credit card, they should consider adding a second card to their account in their son\u2019s or daughter\u2019s name \u2013 assuming they trust their offspring not to run amok with it. Home bank cards are a useful back-up to carry, too. After all, you don\u2019t want to get that call in the middle of the night: \u201cI\u2019ve lost my wallet, and I\u2019m stuck in XXX with no money.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2019 because an earlier version said that Caxton doesn\u2019t have an inactivity charge. Its terms and conditions state that for some of its cardholders, there is a monthly fee of \u00a32 for accounts that have not been used for over two years.
