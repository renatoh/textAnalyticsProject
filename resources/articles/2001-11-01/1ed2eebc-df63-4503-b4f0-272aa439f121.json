By the age of five most kids have worked out that, if their mother and father have embraced something, then it is time to move on. In football a similar litmus test comes in the shape of Leicester City's manager Dave Bassett. My mother was an infant teacher. Early in her career she played a snatch of the overture from Swan Lake to a class of six-year old Teessiders. \"Now what does that music make you think about?\" she asked. \"My dad's garage,\" one of the boys replied. I think of this down-to-earth urchin whenever I see Dave Bassett. The former Wimbledon boss certainly seems the sort of man whose imagination would be fired by the sight of a few jars full of galvanised nails and the whiff of creosote. Though Bassett began his managerial career in the 1980s he clearly belongs to a much earlier and better scrubbed era. Even his photograph gives off an old- fashioned manly British odour of carbolic soap, lanolin and yesterday's cabbage. If the former capo of the Crazy Gang wears after-shave you know it will not be unisex cologne but something with an unambiguously masculine name like Grip or Tool-Shed. It is plain just from looking at him that anything he endorses will instantly be rendered about as avant-garde as larch-lap fencing. The human mind was once something the British regarded rather as they did a Mediterranean shellfish stew. Foreigners might relish delving into it but so much as a glance at the contents was likely to send any self- respecting Anglo-Saxon rushing to the nearest toilet. When Fabien Barthez, a man so full of himself he must be perilously close to bursting at the seams, indulged in his boot-scraping antics before Muzzy Izzet's penalty on Saturday you might therefore have expected Bassett to be annoyed. Instead he was unexpectedly sanguine about the incident, remarking: \"It's all mind games, part and parcel of the game, so I'm not denouncing it.\" If Dave Bassett is now prepared to roll his sleeves up and take his monkey-wrench to the human psyche, then football has indeed changed. In fact, there is evidence of it everywhere - at Tranmere, for example, where the robust Dave Watson, who like Bassett had always appeared as if he might be happier judging a knobbly knees competition than a player's emotional state, has taken on a psychologist to help prepare the first-team squad. When men as defiantly traditional as Watson and Bassett have come to accept psychology as part of football, then there can be only one conclusion: it is plainly yesterday's thing. The innovators must be working further up the line. And indeed they are. For the truly cutting-edge coach a player's psychological state is no longer the key concern. No, in the really modern game it appears that teeth have taken the place of the mind. Players in the rest of the world have been strangely lured towards dentistry as a profession for many years. Hugo Sanchez, the Mexican forward who won the European Golden Boot when he was with Real Madrid, was a dentist; Gheorghe Hagi, the Maradona of the Carpathians, owns a chain of dental surgeries in his native Romania; Peter Kunter, Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper from 1965 to 1976, and Pak Doo Ik, scorer of North Korea's winner over Italy in the 1966 World Cup, were also men who spent their time away from football poking around in people's mouths while muttering \"C3, B42-5\" to an assistant in a nylon uniform. Perhaps that is why the importance of teeth has caught on so quickly with foreign coaches. One of Jean Tigana's first acts on taking over at Craven Cottage was to have the Fulham players' teeth checked so that he could tell if their posture was correct. The Fulham manager's compatriot G\u00e9rard Houllier is clearly of a similar mind because the Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard claimed this year that his groin problems had been alleviated by the arrival of wisdom teeth, while another Frenchman, Marcel Desailly, has blamed recent achilles tendon trouble on unspecified dental problems. Unsurprisingly Dave Bassett has yet to express any views on the new-fangled role of dental care in football. But the fact that over the years he has employed Vinnie Jones and Billy Whitehurst suggests he takes a more cavalier attitude to players' teeth than some of his Premiership contemporaries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
