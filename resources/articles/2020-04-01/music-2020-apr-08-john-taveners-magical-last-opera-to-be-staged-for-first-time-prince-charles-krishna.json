Tavener, one of the most acclaimed British composers of his generation, completed his final opera, Krishna, in 2005 but it has remained in manuscript form, unperformed and largely unknown, since then. A number of years after Tavener\u2019s death in 2013, Prince Charles approached Sir David Pountney, then artistic director of the Welsh National Opera, to ask if he would take a look at Krishna to see if it was a viable opera project. \u201cI did look and I thought yes it was definitely an interesting project,\u201d said Pountney. \u201cI was astonished to discover this massive complete work, never performed, and on a subject which is so close to Tavener\u2019s music and life. It is a very exciting prospect.\u201d Tavener\u2019s mesmerising, trance-inducing music \u2013 listened to by some fans with a joint in hand \u2013 won him a cult following. At the age of 24 the Guardian called him \u201cthe musical discovery of the year\u201d. He first came into the public eye with The Whale (1968), which was released on The Beatles\u2019 Apple label. He became known to many more millions after his Song for Athene was sung by the choir at Princess Diana\u2019s funeral in 1997. Prince Charles was a long-term friend of the composer, who converted to the Russian Orthodox church in the 1970s and once explained: \u201cWe share views on the importance of all religious traditions.\u201d Krishna will be staged by Grange Park Opera, in Surrey, in 2024. Pountney, who will direct it, said it was a substantial work and not straightforward to put on. \u201cIt is ambitious visually and it has magical elements as well as lots of writing for children\u2019s voices and a scene with 14 flutes, some of them floating in mid-air.\u201d He said he took it to Grange Park\u2019s founder and chief executive, Wasfi Kani, because \u201cshe is one of the few people who would have the courage to do this\u201d. Kani recalled first examining the manuscript and being astonished. \u201cIt quickly became clear this was a masterpiece that needed to be brought to life,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are now actively searching for collaborators to give premieres in Europe and, of course, in India. The search for Indian philanthropists begins.\u201d Grange Park is a 700-seat opera theatre built in 2017 in the woods of West Horsley Place, a stately home in Surrey inherited by the former University Challenge presenter Bamber Gascoigne."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
