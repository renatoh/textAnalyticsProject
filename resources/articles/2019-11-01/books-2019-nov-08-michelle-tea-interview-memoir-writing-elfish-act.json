There\u2019s wreckage behind me\u2019", "bodyText": "When the author Michelle Tea began writing in her early 20s, it was, she says, entirely compulsive. She had come through a series of traumatic experiences including the discovery that her stepfather had drilled a hole in the wall of her bedroom in Chelsea, Massachusetts, in order to spy on her, and what she calls her \u201clesbian feminist nervous breakdown\u201d, a sexual and ideological awakening that she laughs about now but at the time she found \u201coverwhelming\u201d. Ten years later, Tea read an essay in the New Yorker about the Harvard neuroscientist Alice Flaherty\u2019s experiences of hypergraphia following a miscarriage, meaning she was possessed with the need to write her story. \u201cReading this experience of what it felt in her body to have this deep desire to write, and have it be so personal, I was, like: \u2018Yes! That\u2019s what it feels like for me\u2019,\u201d she recalls over coffee and cake in a London cafe. Tea is smartly dressed in orange trousers and a black turtleneck; her countercultural roots are just about detectable in the tattoos that curl around her wrists and hands. She is on the last leg of her UK tour during which she has been reading from Against Memoir, a typically visceral and defiant collection of essays spanning nearly two decades of work that variously touches on art, music, alcohol addiction, her stint as a sex worker, her family life and adventures in queer culture (she describes herself as pansexual although, she adds, \u201cmy primary attraction is to masculine and gender-queer people and trans men\u201d). Examining the need to record her experiences in the title essay, she writes: \u201cPersonal narrative is a mental illness, but you don\u2019t want to be well.\u201d She tells me how the compulsion to write is similar to the craving to drink: \u201cIn the way that people in the throes of alcoholism tend to be selfish and in pursuit of one thing, memoir writing is a very selfish act. When you get sober, you have to step back and look at the effects that your drinking may have on the people around you. So I did that for a moment [with writing] and there\u2019s wreckage behind me. It\u2019s complicated and it\u2019s always my hope that if I\u2019m writing about somebody they can at least see that what I\u2019m saying is true, but the reality is that truth is subjective.\u201d Tea, who is also the author of the novels Valencia (2000) and Black Wave (2016), and the memoirs Rent Girl (2005), The Chelsea Whistle (2008) and How to Grow Up (2015), says her new book is a collection of essays and articles \u201cthat are scattered around the internet. I\u2019m just used to books and I prefer them.\u201d Alongside new pieces including \u201cHAGS in Your Face\u201d, about the San Francisco lesbian motorcycle gang, and \u201cPolishness\u201d, about heartbreak in a strange city, there are deeply personal paeans to Prince, the 1980 film Times Square and Valerie Solanas, the author of the Scum Manifesto who shot Andy Warhol in 1968. In \u201cHow to Not Be a Queer Douchebag\u201d, she shares her wisdom about life in the queer community and urges everyone to \u201cstop policing each other ... I have never seen a quadrant of people so ready to tear each other\u2019s faces off as queers.\u201d The book also includes a lengthy and thoughtful dispatch, written in 2003, from the Michigan Womyn\u2019s music festival (MWMF), in which she details the fallout from the festival\u2019s decision to evict a transgender woman from the event in 1991, prompting the creation of a protest camp across the road. What\u2019s striking about this and other essays is how Tea was grappling with themes 15 or so years ago that are widely and often ferociously debated today. \u201cI think right now there\u2019s a critical mass of people talking about this stuff, whether that\u2019s misogyny or queerness or transness,\u201d she reflects. \u201cThe brutal shock of the Trump presidency has made a lot of people feel, like: \u2018Hell no.\u2019 It\u2019s like we didn\u2019t realise how far gone the culture was that this could be allowed. So we have come back with this equally fierce, powerful and brutal response of saying there must be zero tolerance to misogyny, to queer phobia, to transphobia, to racism, to all of the social problems that have always been there.\u201d Tea cites Chavisa Woods\u2019s recent memoir of sexism 100 Times, Andrea Lawlor\u2019s Paul Takes the Form of a Mortal Girl and Brontez Purnell\u2019s Since I Laid My Burden Down as examples of books that have fearlessly and artfully tackled themes of power and gender relations, misogyny and sexual violence. \u201cRight now, I think the [publishing] industry is responding to what is happening and saying: \u2018Yes we really need these voices, we need these ideas out in the world.\u2019 And I think people are hungry for it. They are hungry for work that affirms their values and offers an alternative to what we are seeing.\u201d Tea\u2019s own expertise as a writer lies in blending broader cultural concerns with raw and vivid snapshots of her own life. Born in 1971, she can\u2019t remember a time when she didn\u2019t feel like a fish out of water. \u201cI saw the world differently from others and the people around me,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe things that excited me and inspired me seemed to be odd to everyone else. I craved a larger life than what I saw.\u201d Music was a lifeline, as evidenced by her essays on the bands Gene Loves Jezebel and Minor Threat. \u201cI was a total goth at high school,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBeing able to seek out artists who affirmed my point of view was so important. I knew from music culture that there were people who had figured out how to look how they wanted and say whatever they wanted, and how to be brave and outrageous. These were the people I cared about. I would ask: \u2018What would Siouxsie do?\u2019, rather than \u2018What would my mother do?\u2019\u201d Books also loomed large \u2013 she was captivated by the social commentary in SE Hinton\u2019s The Outsiders, and later became obsessed with Sylvia Plath and the Beat writers. Her lightbulb moment came when she was 20 and read the anthology Angry Women, in which writers and performers including bell hooks, Lydia Lunch, Kathy Acker and Diamanda Gal\u00e1s examined feminism and patriarchal power \u2013 \u201cThat really made me see that there is a lineage [of female writers], and a path, and I could really put myself on that.\u201d Tea subconsciously knew that her stepfather had been spying on her, but says for a long time she had been in denial. \u201cIt\u2019s too much to look at even though you\u2019re haunted by it and accruing all this trauma,\u201d she reflects. \u201cThere are all these tricks you have to do with your mind to stay in that denial.\u201d Part of that process involved drinking \u2013 she began in her mid-teens and didn\u2019t stop until she was 32 when she finally sought help. Her stepfather eventually admitted what he had been doing when she was 19, but her mother decided to stay with him. Tea responded by moving out of the family home and in with a girlfriend in Boston. She was working at two minimum-wage jobs at the time \u2013 as a receptionist in a hair salon and making sandwiches at a deli \u2013 and was always broke. Meanwhile, her girlfriend, who was a sex worker, always seemed to have money. \u201cI thought: \u2018Why am I not doing this?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI had been with my first boyfriend for years and had had a ton of sex that I didn\u2019t enjoy \u2026 At least here it was very cut and dried. I\u2019m not having to pretend to this person \u2018I love it and everything\u2019s great.\u2019 That\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t traumas associated with prostitution, but it was absolutely the best choice for me at the time.\u201d Eventually Tea split up with her girlfriend and moved to San Francisco. It was the early 1990s and, she notes, \u201cThe city was in the throes of a punk, dyke-centric cultural explosion, and I was like: \u2018Woah, are you kidding me? This is incredible.\u201d By this point she was already writing, and tapped into the spoken-word scene, which, she says, \u201cwas very democratic. There were open mics every night. The poetry was self-taught \u2013 punk and hip-hop inspired street poetry. It was perfect for me. I felt I could be my whole self, which at that point was queer, feminist, punk and working-class.\u201d In 1994 she co-founded Sister Spit, a raucous lesbian-feminist spoken word and performance art collective, the aim of which was to give voice to the queer and working-class women who felt they had been excluded by second-wave feminism and who aspired to the life of a touring rock band. \u201cWe were, largely, a group of people who had heard the word \u2018no\u2019 a lot,\u201d she writes in Against Memoir. \u201cNo to being queer, to wanting to be artists, and to thinking anyone would want to listen to our attitudinal manifestos.\u201d Nowadays, Tea lives in Los Angeles, writing books, putting on literary events and looking after her young son, Atticus. In 2013 she married her partner Dashiell Lippman. In the midst of marital bliss, the autobiographical writing has continued to pour forth. One essay in Against Memoir called \u201cHow to Refer to My Husband-Wife\u201d finds Tea pondering the question of what to call \u201cmy totally masculine female partner\u201d. As the officiant uttered the words \u201cI now pronounce you \u2026\u201d at their wedding, she recalls how \u201cthe phrase hung in the air, truncated, and we all waited to see what my love and I were about to become.\u201d Tea tells me that, at readings, people approach her to thank her for writing about her life because it\u2019s made them feel less alone, and validated. By extension, she says, this makes her feel less alone and validated \u201cbecause I come from a family that had and continues to have a lot of denial. When I was younger, part of my writing was to claim my experience and to affirm that it was real and that it happened.\u201d I ask if there is a personal cost to her candour and in returning repeatedly to the more difficult aspects of her life. \u201cNot at all,\u201d she replies. \u201cMy daily life is informed by my past traumas. I don\u2019t dwell on them and neither do I bury them. At this point I think I\u2019m in the space of acceptance about everything. People say that it\u2019s cathartic to write about certain things. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s cathartic, but I also don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s opening a wound. I feel like it\u2019s just talking about life.\u201d \u2022 Against Memoir is published by And Other Stories (\u00a310). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.
