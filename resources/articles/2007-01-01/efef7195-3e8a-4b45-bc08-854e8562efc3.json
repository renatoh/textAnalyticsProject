Three months of painstaking research has seen the light van broken up into hundreds of 'finds' and archived. Chosen to test techniques on \"a common and characteristic part of contemporary life,\" the vehicle was given to Bristol university by the Ironbridge museum in Shropshire. Everything from a Victorian threepenny bit, dropped down a crack in the floor of the van, to crude spot-welds have been scrutinised and recorded. \"In many ways it has been like a conventional study in field archaeology,\" said Cassie Newland, a doctoral student at Bristol who organised the project as a trial of archaeology's potential to help in the analysis of modern British society. Three separate layers within the van were then carefully excavated, yielding lost pencils, dog hair and confetti from a distant museum party. Fingerprint dusting proved that the Transit was one of Ford motor company's first British vehicles made by robots - \"a discovery reflecting a huge social change in employment,\" said Ms Newland. All finds are to be reported in British Archaeology magazine and other data on the Transit, one of only 191 surviving models of its type and year, will be kept at Bristol for future study. Ms Newland said: \"Archaeology concerns the interpretation of material culture in pursuit of understanding. That material can be van just as a prehistoric ditch or settlement.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
