Best Mate at Ascot, Lord Noelie in the Hennessy and Edredon Bleu in last weekend's Tingle Creek Chase all performed with great credit, but had to settle for minor honours. Undaunted, the trainer is gearing Foly Pleasant for a Cheltenham rematch with Shooting Light in Saturday's top prize, the Tripleprint Gold Cup. Foly Pleasant is handicapped to take his revenge on the winner, enjoying a 7lb pull for three lengths. But he can be backed at 7-1 with Ladbrokes, who make Shooting Light - one of seven Martin Pipe-trained entries - 4-1 favourite, with recent Wetherby winner Banker Count next in at 5-1. Knight believes the turnaround in the weights, the slight increase in distance -two miles and about five furlongs on the New Course - and the possibility of easier ground will all play to her horse's strengths. \"Hopefully, it will be softer than last time. There is an extra furlong or so in this race as well and it is all good news for us,\" said the trainer, who added that Foly Pleasant is very well. Legal Right is the new top-weight on Saturday following the anticipated defection of Fadalko, resulting in a 10lb rise in the weights. They will go up again if Legal Right is an absentee. He ran away with the race two years ago, but is hard to keep sound and has made the racecourse on precious few occasions since. Cyfor Malta is not one of the Pipe contingent, but Ilnamar catches the eye. He shaped nicely behind Cyfor Malta at Newbury when very much the stable's second string. Ladbrokes quote him at 7-1 alongside Dusk Duel. Nicky Henderson is hoping Dusk Duel will take his chance. \"He is going to work tomorrow and we will make a decision after that,\" he said. A good run by Dusk Duel or Logician - 9-1 with Ladbrokes for the Tripleprint- would boost the King George VI Chase prospects of Knight's up-and-coming chaser Best Mate, who had the latter pair behind him when second to Wahiba Sands at Ascot. Meanwhile, stable jockey Jim Culloty is confident of returning to the saddle in time to partner Best Mate at Kempton on Boxing Day. Culloty's chances looked slim after he broke an arm in a fall at Taunton last month. But, after seeing a specialist yesterday, the Irishman was upbeat about his prospects. \"I am pretty confident I will be back. The consultant told me I should be riding out by the 20th,\" said Culloty. \"I have just taken the cast off and the arm is healing nicely. I have another covering on which I can take off when I need to. It is looking quite good.\" Madame Jones, bidding for a record 12 handicap wins in a season - her latest victory coming in a classified stakes - could finish only fourth to Inchcoonan at Southwell yesterday, but will be back in action at Wolverhampton today. Joanna Badger, replacing published jockey Fran Ferris, who was ill, settled Madame Jones in fourth place early and, having to race wide entering the straight, came past beaten horses but could not make up the leeway. Paul Scallan takes the ride in the attheraces.co.uk Handicap this afternoon. The records show that only two other horses have won 11 handicaps in a season and even if she fails today, trainer David Evans has other opportunities for Madame Jones later in the week. The seven furlongs handicap Madame Jones contests today is pretty competitive. A tentative vote goes to Turku (2.40) , who finished fifth behind the in-form Celtic Thatcher over a longer trip here last week. At Fontwell, Red Hare (3.30) looks a fair bet to follow up his decisive Kempton victory. He looked good value for his win there and a 6lb rise in the weights is not harsh. \u00b7 Sedgefield will hold a precautionary inspection shortly before 7am to determine prospects for today's card. General manager Alan Brown said: \"It is basically because of the fog more than the frost. But we have been told we are likely to get one or the other.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
