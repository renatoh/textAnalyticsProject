Allen, a star player at the university who later coached the program for six seasons, was not identified in the indictment filed against the businessman on Thursday in Miami, but the court documents include descriptions of a Philadelphia school and a timeframe that corresponds to Allen\u2019s tenure with the Quakers. Prosecutors allege the businessman, Philip Esformes of Miami Beach, gave \u2018Coach 2\u2019 more than $74,000 in cash, a recruiting trip to Miami and a separate ride on a private jet in 2013 and 2014. Esformes is charged with health-care fraud, money laundering, conspiracy and bribery. The filing, according to the Bloomberg report, says the bribes were intended to help Esformes\u2019s son, Morris, then a high school basketball player at Miami\u2019s Hebrew Academy, gain admission to Penn. Allen didn\u2019t immediately comment when contacted through the Celtics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
