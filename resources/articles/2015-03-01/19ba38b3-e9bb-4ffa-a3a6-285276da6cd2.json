The already fierce debate over delivery drones heated up on Tuesday when Amazon \u2013 which has threatened to withdraw drone development from the US because of strict regulations \u2013 attacked the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) for putting America\u2019s role at the heart of the state of the art technology at risk by delaying the approval of testing licences. Paul Misener, Amazon\u2019s vice-president for global public policy, told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the FAA took more than six months to respond to its request to test-fly its drones \u2013 so long that by the time the licence was granted the drone was already obsolete. \u201cWe don\u2019t test it any more. We\u2019ve moved on to more advanced designs that we already are testing abroad,\u201d Misener said. \u201cNowhere outside of the United States have we been required to wait more than one or two months to begin testing.\u201d He said the company had had to wait more than six months for FAA approval for outdoor testing. \u201cThis low level of government attention and slow pace are inadequate, especially compared to the regulatory efforts in other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FAA already has adequate statutory authority. What the FAA needs is impetus.\u201d Misener said that the US will continue to fall further behind other countries in the new and potentially lucrative industry unless the FAA picks up the pace of granting regulatory approval. He said other countries had taken much more \u201creasonable\u201d approaches and recognised the potential economic benefits of commercial drone operations. Amazon began testing its drones, for a potential delivery service called Prime Air, in Cambridge, UK, last November. Industry experts have said drones could generate nearly $14bn of economic activity in the US in the first three years of integration and $82bn over a decade. The FAA said safety was its primary concern. Margaret Gilligan, the FAA\u2019s associate administrator for aviation safety, said an advisory panel is developing standards for detect-and-avoid technology and radio controls, which are expected in 2016. \u201cAs proposed, the United States would have one of the most flexible [drone] regulatory frameworks in the world,\u201d she said. The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents 50,000 commercial pilots, said: \u201cIt is vitally important that the pressure to capitalise on the technology [does] not lead to an incomplete safety analysis of the aircraft and operations.\u201d It said drones must be proved to identify and manoeuvre to avoid other aircraft. In draft rules released in February the FAA said pilots must remain within sight of drones. Amazon has complained that being forced to keep pilots so close to drones would prevent it from operating its planned droned delivery service in the US and could force it to develop the technology overseas instead. Misener said Amazon\u2019s Prime Air service aims to deliver packages within 30 minutes by flying drones below 500ft. He said the use of drones would increase overall safety as it would mean fewer consumers driving to the shops and a reduction in delivery trucks on the road. Amazon submitted a request to the FAA to test a new model drone on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
