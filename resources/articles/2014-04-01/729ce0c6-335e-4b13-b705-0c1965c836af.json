In Korea, super-rich ladies in Prada are becoming frightened of their mutinous servants. In America, a grown man in diapers pretends to be a baby until the cops drag him bawling from the sidewalk to the crowd's bewilderment. You know where you are with video art: it likes to take you all over the world. The moving image is everywhere \u2013 in both respects \u2013 at the sixth edition of the Glasgow international festival of art (GI), but that's hardly unusual in the caravan of biennials forever circling the planet. Nothing travels so neatly or cheaply as a DVD. What is significant about this GI is that its focus is so emphatically global. In the past, of course, selectors could achieve this without going outside the city at all. By general consent, Glasgow has one of the world's most fertile art scenes, enriched by the constant presence of artists from elsewhere. And you can still see something of that in the gorgeous transformation of Glasgow School of Art using little more than tinfoil, sherbet-coloured paint and a ricochet of reflections by the Glasgow-based German artist Michael Stumpf. But this year is different. This year is not so exhilaratingly free, experimental and home-based; it feels more homogenised. Take the magnificent McLellan Galleries on Sauchiehall Street, in use for 150 years and recently reopened for the first time in seven years. This is Glasgow in fine style \u2013 marble walls, double staircases, vast panelled galleries for old masters \u2013 and a revelation to behold. But the building is more impressive than its contents. Downstairs are the aggressive films of the New York artist Jordan Wolfson, currently the very squeak of chic for his animatronic lap-dancer and his super-sharp use of CGI techniques over stock footage, all scored to Mazzy Star and Beyonc\u00e9. Upstairs are the computer-generated drawings of the New York artist Avery Singer, pale and etiolated, like something that has crawled out from under a stone. If they sound like the kind of art you find at Frieze, this is where GI's new director, Sarah McCrory, last worked. The glorious baths of Govanhill are also being used as a gallery. This Edwardian palace, its vaulting cupola sending down a tiny echo of the gleeful sounds that must have rung out when the swimming pool was still in use, before the council shut it so outrageously in 2001 to the distress of the community, is a heart-rending vision of redundancy and loss. The vacant cubicles are still etched with the last words of the local people. Now it's filled with inflatable cubes printed with images \u2013 60s dollybirds, Rodin's The Kiss \u2013 that feel as fatuously inconsequential here as they did in 2012 when the artists (Anthea Hamilton and Nicholas Byrne) stuffed them in a swimming pool in Poplar, east London. There's better prospecting at the Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA) where the Slovenian artist Aleksandra Domanovic has a hanging garden of immense transparent sheets bearing half-familiar motifs \u2013 rockets, robots, strange inventions out of sci-fi movies, a hint of Sigourney Weaver, Sandra Bullock and the lone female cosmonaut. You weave your way through these giant banners, wondering where it's all leading, and the payoff is properly shocking: a rejection letter from Walt Disney to a young woman in 1938. \"Women do not do any of the creative work preparing the cartoons. That work is performed entirely by men.\" The only available job was tracing characters on to celluloid; Domanovic's installation becomes a huge sardonic parody. There is an exact echo in Lucy Reynolds's sound work high in the eaves of the School of Art, where the names of those precious few women allowed to enrol as students a century ago throng the air. They were confined to a single studio. The corridor outside is still known as the hen run. Upstairs at GoMA, Sue Tompkins has a beautifully strange show. Memories of snatched conversations, of half-forgotten lyrics and unfulfilled thoughts, stuttered out on old typewriters, are somewhere between concrete poetry and Samuel Beckett. On the walls, thoughts find form in zips that nearly make it all the way up, get stuck, or can't be toothed together at all, dangling pathetically from pieces of chiffon \u2013 flimsy things, almost caught. Some thoughts get further than others. There is a lot of sculpture \u2013 literally \u2013 in the Briggaitt where Victorian busts, modernist nudes and terracotta warriors keep strange company in the courtyard. And the community spirit is alive at the Common Guild, where the Mexican artist Gabriel Kuri has assembled those needful emergency items \u2013 blankets, waterbottles, sleeping bags \u2013 into gentle send-ups of Carl Andre's bricks. The materials were donated, briefly used for this humanised minimalism, and will be given to charity at the end of the festival. The high point of which is undoubtedly the Tramway, which has become a house of humour for the duration. Here you can see videos of the veteran US performance artist Michael Smith, playing his wonderfully tragicomic Mike. Hapless, badly dressed, rubber-faced, Mike is an Everyman Zelig who pops up everywhere, always out of joint with the times he so vividly sends up. The real man is making appearances at GI too. Best of all, once again, is the inimitable Bedwyr Williams, who has turned the immense central hangar into a dark, dank forest where a coach has stalled in the middle of the night. The luggage has tumbled from its hold, which now emits a fantastical film from its innards. Epic, tormented, hilarious, black, it dreams up a horrible world some time after a major catastrophe in which England has gone feral and turned in on itself with medieval violence. Those with the most stuff \u2013 toys, lawnmowers, garden gnomes, forks \u2013 are top. The king simply has more hats than anyone else, his shoes so profusely laced he can no longer walk. Planning officers are buried alive in miniature buildings, councillors are ritually humiliated for their corruption, nightclub bouncers enforce a vicious feudal system in the vacuum. And there in the middle of it all is Bedwyr himself, madcap visionary, artist-cum-poet out of whose conscious all this is streaming as he lies dreaming on the floor of the emergency sports hall surrounded by the snoring forms of hundreds of pensioners, their kindliness and wisdom a comfort in the present crisis. At one point he remarks that there is nobody left to satirise the bad, so they just get worse. But this is Williams's own role \u2013 his own great Swiftian achievement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
