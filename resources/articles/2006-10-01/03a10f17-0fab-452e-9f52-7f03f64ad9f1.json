As England's bowling coach he was directly responsible for the quartet whose unstinting pace and accuracy played a key part in winning the Ashes. Now he has swapped sides and is working on two new projects that could help Australia regain the urn. After watching Steve Harmison, Andrew Flintoff, Matthew Hoggard and Simon Jones do their damage last year Cricket Australia moved in on Cooley, a Tasmanian, to make him national bowling coach. Five months on and his impact was evident when Australia beat England in Jaipur. Two Queensland quicks, Mitchell Johnson and Shane Watson, took six wickets between them. Johnson, a 24-year-old left-armer, tempted Kevin Pietersen into a fatal hook while the economical 25-year-old Watson did for Flintoff with a bouncer. It is Cooley who has transformed them, so much so that Allan Border, a fortnight after resigning as a national selector, has called for the panel to name Johnson in the squad for the first Test in Brisbane. Ask any Australian player, coach or administrator about Cooley, and you will hear the kind of references usually reserved for the divine. The fast bowlers credit him with improving their games; some even describing conversations with him as providing the epiphany for which they have waited their entire careers. The echoes of his deadly influence on Flintoff and Harmison are clear, and it is worrying news for England. Cooley's greatest asset, according to those who have worked with him, is his ability to communicate. Not schoolmasterly, like Duncan Fletcher, nor overly technical, like John Buchanan, Cooley can digest the most complicated theories such as the recently discovered contrast swing (where the ball swings towards the rough side at lower speeds), and relay them in a manner that fast bowlers can understand. In Johnson's case Cooley has refined the package which Dennis Lillee famously declared was a \"once in a generation\" proposition when he saw him as a 17-year-old. \"For Mitch, it has been about giving him a role as a strike bowler and helping him to achieve that,\" Cooley said yesterday. \"The raw ingredients were in place, so it's more been a case of making little corrections here and there and fixing up the odd thing in his technique.\" The results have been astounding. Johnson, barely three years removed from losing his state contract with Queensland, has become Australia's best one-day pace weapon in the past month, at a time when Glenn McGrath - who Cooley is easing back after an eight-month break from the game - is still to fully find his feet. Johnson's brand of left-arm pace - complete with that rarest of Australian commodities, swing - has prompted the demise, and drawn the praise of, Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara in recent weeks. Though Stuart Clark of New South Wales is still thought to be ahead in the queue for Brisbane, Border's wish may come true. \"With guys like Mitchell and Shane we profiled the strengths and weaknesses of their games just after I arrived,\" Cooley said. \"Then it was a matter of getting their fitness and workload levels up, and focusing on working on their strengths. One of the reasons that Mitchell and Shane are looking a bit ahead of everyone is that they played in the Top End series [A games against Pakistan, India and New Zealand in Darwin and Cairns] whereas the others are coming from a pretty cold start.\" Watson suffered a minor setback in India yesterday when he went to hospital with chest and stomach pains, though it is not thought to be serious. And Cooley's contributions to his bowling have been stark. For years Watson has been capable of clocking speeds in excess of 85mph, but has been almost robotic in his lack of variation, be that pace, line or length. By adding variety, Watson is now the frontrunner to claim Australia's No6 place for the first Test ahead of Michael Clarke, Andrew Symonds and Simon Katich. Unlike Flintoff, who is viewed as an out-and-out match-winner, Watson is seen as an insurance player, able to take the bowling pressure off the likes of McGrath and the batting strain off Gilchrist. \"We've added a few deliveries to Shane and given him a role in the team; a role he is comfortable with and one that will help him enjoy his cricket,\" Cooley said. \"His role with the ball is to lend assistance to our strike bowlers. That's not to say he couldn't emerge into a strike bowler, but at the moment he is happy to support.\" England Started May 2003 What he did Brought over by the ECB's academy director, Rodney Marsh. Specialised in the strains fast bowling puts on young bodies and how to minimise them: taught a 20-year-old James Anderson to land on the sole of his foot rather than his heel to prevent back problems. Helped Andrew Flintoff channel his on-field aggression into his bowling and got him to bowl round the wicket at left-handers; cut down Simon Jones's run-up without affecting his pace and taught Steve Harmison to stand straight at point of delivery, hit the crease harder and find accuracy. Australia Started May 2006 What he has done Based himself in Brisbane as head of the fast-bowling training programme, working with Australia team and state associations. Brief is to produce \"a conveyor belt of fast bowlers for the future\". Has made sure his bowlers can use reverse swing. \"If conditions suit, we'll definitely try to take advantage of it,\" he says. Worked on technique with Mitchell Johnson and Shane Watson to bring them to periphery of Test team and helped Glenn McGrath back after eight-month break."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
