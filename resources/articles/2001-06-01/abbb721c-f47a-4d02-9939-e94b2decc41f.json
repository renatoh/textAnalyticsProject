Morley painted, at the scale of the original, a reproduction he came across of Vermeer's The Art of Painting, in the subdued colour tones of an old art book. With meticulous craft he captures the melancholy of the reproduction, the sadness of living life or art at second hand. At his best, the melancholy of the second-hand is Morley's subject; but too much of the time it is simply his condition. The first paintings in this exhibition are imitations of those fierce celebrants Willem de Kooning and Cy Twombly. We then move on to paintings counterfeiting Andy Warhol. I suppose it might seem good value, getting so many 20th-century styles from one man. But it's a complete rip-off. When Morley, who had grown up in wartime London and done time in Wormwood Scrubs, emigrated to New York in 1958, the city was at its cultural peak. You can't blame the awed young artist for copying the great masters he found there. But why should we be asked to genuflect before the results? The pseudo-Warhols, which imitate the stark effect of the silkscreen by careful brushwork, are particularly pathetic. They look mediocre, and so does the Hayward on this occasion. It makes you wonder how Morley has won so much praise over the years. The only time this exhibition flares into a kind of half-life is in Morley's phase as a super-realist in the late 1960s. His kitsch group of passengers dining aboard a transatlantic liner, painted in 1966, glorifies, or mocks, or laments a form of leisure that was already archaic. The men are in black tie, the women in pearls; a black-gloved hand holds up a glass of champagne in the foreground. The smiles at this gathering are forced. This unconvincing grin is there again when a family at Daytona Beach insist just a little too forcefully that they are as happy as the surf records tell them to be. Elsewhere it is Morley's painting that seems forced. With his obsession with his 1940s childhood and taste for the epic, he is the painterly equivalent of the British film-maker John Boorman; both sound wonderful in theory but rarely rise above the ordinary in practice. But at least Boorman got a couple of great performances out of Lee Marvin. \u0095 Until August 27. Details: 020-7921 0951."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
