The worry is that every time it happens, the reaction is worse. If it wasn't for our medical people, I could have lost my life.\" Joynt, 32, is angry at suggestions made on Sky Sports on Sunday that he had collapsed after having a painkilling injection. \"I can honestly state I have never had a painkilling injection in order to play a game of rugby league,\" Joynt said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
