Here\u2019s a glance at today\u2019s major news items: US passes 5m Covid cases as Republican calls Trump order \u2018unconstitutional slop\u2019. The United States on Sunday passed the grim milestone of 5m coronavirus cases, as Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders seeking to break a political impasse over further economic relief were denounced by a Republican as \u201cunconstitutional slop\u201d. Pelosi says \u2018everything is left out\u2019 of Trump\u2019s executive actions. House speaker Nancy Pelosi, like her Democrat colleague Chuck Schumer, is unimpressed with Trump\u2019s executive actions to provide economic relief for Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic. Portland protesters set police building on fire and clash with authorities. A fire lit inside a police union building by a small fraction of protesters in Portland overnight led the authorities to declare the situation a riot and then use flashbang munitions and smoke canisters to force hundreds away from the area. Joe Biden pledges to block Pebble Mine in Alaska if he wins White House. The presumptive Democratic presidential candidate said on Sunday that if he\u2019s elected, his administration would stop a proposed copper and gold mine in Alaska\u2019s Bristol Bay region. Three parks and wildlife employees die in helicopter crash during bighorn sheep survey. Three Texas Parks and Wildlife Department employees have been killed in a helicopter crash while conducting aerial surveys for desert bighorn sheep in the south-western part of the state, according to officials. Big oil remembers \u2018friend\u2019 Trump with millions in campaign funds. In mid-June the oil pipeline billionaire Kelcy Warren hosted a fundraising bash at his palatial Dallas, Texas, home that drew the presence of Donald Trump and raised $10m for the US president\u2019s campaign coffers. Donald Trump has arrived in the New Jersey beachside community of Long Branch after making the short journey on Marine One from Bedminster for tonight\u2019s meeting with campaign donors. Opponents and supporters of Trump gathered on either side of Ocean Avenue for hours ahead of the president\u2019s anticipated arrival on Sunday afternoon, trading chants of \u201cDump Trump!\u201d and \u201cFour more years!\u201d while holding signs that said \u201cThank you Trump\u201d, \u201cTrump 2020\u201d and \u201cThank Q\u201d. Tonight\u2019s private event marks Trump\u2019s third fundraiser in two nights after a Hamptons two-step on Saturday that was expected to raise $15m for his campaign and the Republican National Committee: the first at the Southampton residence of billionaire former hedge fund manager John Paulson, the second at Bridgehampton home of his son, Donald Trump Jr, and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who also is a top fundraiser for Trump Victory, a joint fundraising operation between Trump\u2019s campaign, the RNC and a variety of state parties. New York governor Andrew Cuomo called Donald Trump\u2019s executive order extending federal unemployment insurance \u201claughable\u201d and another chapter in the federal government\u2019s botched response to the coronavirus in a conference call with reporters on Sunday. Trump said on Saturday he would use unspent funds from the Cares act to continue unemployment payments to millions of newly unemployed Americans at a rate of $400 per week \u2013 a $200 drop from the earlier $600 payment \u2013 but mandated individual states cover 25% of the payment. \u201cThe concept of saying to states, you pay 25% of the insurance, is just laughable,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an impossibility. So none of this is real on the federal side. This is going to have to be resolved.\u201d The Democratic governor said he didn\u2019t know if Trump was \u201cgenuine in thinking the executive order is a resolution or if this is just a tactic in the negotiation. But this is irreconcilable for the state. And I expect this is just a chapter in the book of Washington Covid mismanagement.\u201d Cuomo praised New Yorkers for driving down the rate of infections in the state so low that only 0.78% of 65,812 tests performed Saturday came back positive. He said the 131 individuals in intensive care units also represented the lowest number since the early days of the health crisis. Three Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) employees have been killed in a helicopter crash while conducting aerial surveys for desert bighorn sheep in the south-western part of the state, according to officials. The crash happened on Saturday in the remote wilderness of Black Gap Wildlife Management Area, which is adjacent to Big Bend National Park, on the Rio Grande that marks the border with Mexico. The victims of the crash were identified as wildlife biologist Dewey Stockbridge, fish and wildlife technician Brandon White, and state wildlife veterinarian Bob Dittmar, according to the TPWD. \u201cNo words can begin to express the depth of sadness we feel for the loss of our colleagues in this tragic accident,\u201d Carter Smith, executive director of TPWD, said in the statement.\u201d \u201cThese men were consummate professionals, deeply liked and highly regarded by their peers and partners alike for the immense passion, dedication, and expertise they brought to their important work in wildlife management and veterinary medicine,\u201d he said. Details of the crash are so far limited and an official investigation by the authorities is underway, according to local media reports. Presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said on Sunday that if he\u2019s elected, his administration would stop a proposed copper and gold mine in Alaska\u2019s Bristol Bay region. \u201cIt is no place for a mine,\u201d Biden said in a statement on Sunday afternoon. \u201cThe Obama-Biden Administration reached that conclusion when we ran a rigorous, science-based process in 2014, and it is still true today.\u201d The Environmental Protection Agency under the Obama administration proposed restricting development in the area but never finalized the restrictions. The agency retains the option to invoke that so-called veto process again if it decides to do so. Biden\u2019s remarks came five days after a surprise intervention from Donald Trump Jr breathed life into efforts to protect the biggest remaining wild salmon run on the planet. Trump Jr expressed his opposition to the controversial project, breaking with his father\u2019s administration\u2019s efforts to advance the development of the Pebble mine, which would be built near headwaters of the Bristol Bay salmon fishery about 200 miles southwest of Anchorage. On July 24, the Army Corps of Engineers issued its final environmental analysis for the mine, which essentially green-lights development of what would be the largest mine in North America. Many experts have criticized the environmental review process as hurried and containing crucial gaps in the science. Donald Trump, who spent the night at his private golf club in New Jersey, took part in a virtual conference call today with international leaders on Lebanon in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s massive chemical explosion that devastated the capital. White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere shared the following readout of the call: The President expressed his deepest condolences for those killed and injured in the Beirut explosion. President Trump reaffirmed that the United States stands ready and willing to continue providing aid to help the people of Lebanon in their recovery. The President agreed with the other leaders to work closely together in international response efforts. President Trump also urged the Government of Lebanon to conduct a full and transparent investigation, in which the United States stands ready to assist. The President called for calm in Lebanon and acknowledged the legitimate calls of peaceful protestors for transparency, reform, and accountability. French president Emmanuel Macron, who organized the donor conference in collaboration with the United Nations, warned \u201cit is certainly the future of Lebanon and its people that\u2019s at stake, but also the future of an entire region\u201d. Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that the explosion in Beirut was a bomb attack in off-the-cuff remarks at the White House on Tuesday were quickly walked back by Pentagon officials, raising the question of where the president got his information. Lebanese officials were reported to have sought urgent clarification from US diplomats. Sunday\u2019s teleconference raised a total of $298m in emergency aid, organizers said. North Carolina\u2019s department of health and human services reported 1,452 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, increasing the overall total to 136,218. Officials said 1,109 people were hospitalized with the virus on Sunday, 20 fewer than Saturday. Eight additional coronavirus-related deaths in the past 24-hour period have lifted the statewide death toll to 1,109 since the start of the pandemic. The Republican national convention was initially set for Charlotte, North Carolina\u2019s most populous city, but party leaders downscaled the event because of concerns about coronavirus. The city will still play host to a smaller gathering of Republican delegates to hold the meetings necessary to officially nominate Trump as the party\u2019s candidate in the November presidential election. Three more days of speeches and other events are set to take place, though Republicans have not announced where those will take place. A total of nine students and staff members at a Georgia high school that made national headlines after a photo shared on social media showed its hallways packed with teenagers, many of them not wearing masks, have tested positive for the coronavirus. North Paudling High School principal Gabe Carmona wrote Saturday that six students and three staff members returned positive tests in a letter obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Hannah Watters, a sophomore at the school who was initially suspended for posting the photo to Twitter, has since had her punishment revoked, CNN reported. Elsewhere in Georgia, the AP reports that school officials in a nearby metro Atlanta county said 12 students and two staff members across a dozen schools tested positive for the virus during their first week back at school. The Cherokee County school system reported that more than 250 students with potential exposure had been sent home to quarantine for two weeks. As our Ed Pilkington wrote today, Georgia is one of 21 states across the US that have been placed by the White House coronavirus taskforce in the \u201cred zone\u201d, indicating the disease is now so prevalent that immediate restrictions must be imposed to avoid dire consequences. \u201cOur situation is rapidly getting out of control,\u201d Melanie Thompson, an Atlanta physician and co-organizer of the letter, told the Guardian. \u201cFrontline health workers are at the end of their ropes \u2013 we have been left on our own to make it up as we go along, while the governor fails to do what\u2019s needed to control this epidemic.\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday reported 4,974,959 cases of the new coronavirus, an increase of 54,590 cases from its previous count a day prior, and said that the number of deaths had risen by 1,064 to 161,284. The CDC reported its tally of cases of the respiratory illness known as Covid-19, caused by a new coronavirus, as of 4pm ET on 8 August. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. Richard Luscombe has the latest on the pandemic\u2019s spread in Florida: Florida has set a grim new coronavirus milestone: 3,355 hospitalizations in a week, the highest since the pandemic began. The Sunday-to-Sunday statistic comes at the end of an already bleak week in which the state passed both half a million confirmed cases and 8,000 deaths, according to figures from the Florida department of health. If there is a silver lining, it\u2019s that the numbers of new cases appears to be trending lower (6,229 news cases reported Sunday after three consecutive days above 7,000) and that the state\u2019s positivity rate has fallen below 9% for only the second time this month. The statewide average of positive tests was above 12% on several occasions through July. Still, the figures show that Florida remains a hotspot for Covid-19, and stands second to only California (554,160) in the number of cases nationwide. Meanwhile, there is a growing backlash to efforts by Florida\u2019s political leaders to order schools to reopen with on-campus tuition for students this month. Last month Republican governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s department of education issued an executive order mandating the reopening of bricks-and-mortar schools five days a week. School districts in most of the state\u2019s 67 counties are ignoring the order on safety grounds, and will start the school year with online learning, while this week the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics put out its own guidance, essentially opposing the reopening of schools until cases and rates of positivity are significantly lower. If schools reopen too soon, \u201cyou\u2019ll be chasing [coronavirus] all over the place, and I don\u2019t know if the health department has the personnel to really handle how much that might be,\u201d Dr Michael Muszynski, a FCAAP expert in pediatric infectious diseases, wrote to DeSantis. The Democrats\u2019 presumptive presidential candidate, Joe Biden, published a statement on Medium late on Saturday night in anticipation of the US reaching 5m Covid-19 cases, a landmark that was reached earlier today by Johns Hopkins\u2019 reckoning but was passed yesterday by other counts. \u201cIt\u2019s a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFive million is more than the entire population of Alabama \u2013 or of more than half the states in our union, for that matter. Each time the number clicks up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. And for the families of the more than 160,000 souls who have died because of this virus, it is a pain that can never be undone.\u201d Biden also hit out at Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic as the two men prepare to compete for the presidency in November\u2019s elections. \u201cAnd yet, we continue to hear little more from President Trump than excuses and lies in an effort to cover for his repeated failures of leadership \u2013 failures that worsened the pandemic here at home, and in turn deepened our economic crisis,\u201d he wrote. While many Republicans have said the weekly unemployment benefits during Covid-19 encourage people not to work, Gene Marks says some small business owners support such efforts: About 30 million unemployed Americans are now on tenterhooks waiting to see if the $600-a-week federal unemployment benefit created by the Cares Act will be renewed. As the political row over its efficacy and necessity continues, the House and the Senate remain far apart on a compromise. What shouldn\u2019t be left out of the discussion is an unlikely, yet numerous, group of people who do support the added benefit: small business owners. The issue is complicated. Many I know in the business community have taken issue with the additional $600 federal payment. They complain that a great number of their workers \u2013 particularly hourly and part-timers \u2013 have avoided returning to the workplace because the benefit provides them with more compensation then they were getting at their job and merely incentivizes them to stop working. But some studies \u2013 like this one from a group of Yale University researchers \u2013 have found the opposite to be true. The study found \u201cno evidence\u201d that workers receiving the added federal unemployment benefit were disincentivized to work and that \u201cpeople with more generously expanded benefits also resumed working at a similar or slightly quicker rate than others did\u201d. However, as the Wall Street Journal points out, the study excluded part-time workers and other \u201cshort-termers\u201d who make up the vast majority of employees that benefited the most from the federal bump. \u201cA worker in Louisiana who made $2,400 from part-time jobs all of last year would collect $2,516 a month in jobless benefits today \u2013 $29 a week from the state plus the $600. An average worker who had made $17 per hour ($680 a week) in Ohio has been able to collect $940 each week with the federal boost.\u201d The debate will continue. But many small business owners remain convinced the payments should continue. Why? Because it has provided a safety net for their employees during a time when their companies couldn\u2019t pay wages due to the country\u2019s self-inflicted economic collapse. You can read the full article below: Tom Inglesby, the director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, has appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press to discuss hopes for a Covid-19 vaccine. Infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said early vaccines may only be effective for half the population. Inglesby said such a vaccine would be better than nothing. \u201cI think we would take 50% because 50% would be a lot better than what we have now,\u201d he said. Inglesby added: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what we get, for the amount of time that has passed \u2026 to have a vaccine that\u2019s 50% effective in the coming months or the beginning of 2021 would be phenomenal.\u201d He also said that fresh lockdowns should be considered in areas where the virus surges. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re doomed, I think we know what to do, other countries have done it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that in other countries, universal masking, physical distancing, avoiding larger gatherings, those kinds of things have worked. If we act together in national unison we can get there.\u201d While the US passed the grim milestone of 5m Covid-19 cases earlier today, there are areas in America where the virus appears, at least for now, to be under control. New York, which recorded horrific daily death tolls in the early stages of the pandemic, now has the \u201clowest number of people we had in ICU units since the start,\u201d according to the state\u2019s governor Andrew Cuomo. Of the 65,812 tests reported on Saturday, 515 were positive. That rate, 0.78%, is also the lowest since the start of the pandemic said Cuomo. However, there were still seven deaths from the virus recorded on Saturday and Cuomo urged New Yorkers to be \u201csmart and stay cautious\u201d. Cuomo also dismissed Donald Trump\u2019s executive action that says states will pay 25% of the weekly benefits going to the unemployed during the pandemic. \u201cExecutive orders will not be a substitute for legislation,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou can\u2019t now say to states who have no funding you have to pay 25% of the unemployment insurance cause.\u201d Three months ago, the Republican governor of Missouri chose not to wear a mask in a shop, because he said he wasn\u2019t going to let the government tell him what to do. Mike Parson visited a hardware store to celebrate its reopening after he lifted Missouri\u2019s coronavirus lockdown over the objections of health professionals and mayors of major cities. Parson said the worst of the pandemic was past and the economic impact of the shutdown was worse than the virus. As for masks, the governor dismissively claimed \u201cthere was a lot of information on both sides\u201d over whether to wear one so he wasn\u2019t going to require people to do so. Three months later, Covid-19 is surging in Missouri and in many other parts of the midwest that imagined they had escaped the worst of the pandemic. Health specialists predict a sharp increase in deaths across the region in the coming weeks that will be made significantly worse in some states by the politicians who followed Donald Trump\u2019s lead in undermining medical advice and in questioning the value of masks. You can read the full article below: Florida\u2019s department of health reported 77 deaths from Covid-19 and 6,190 new cases of the virus on Sunday. Although the number of new cases has fallen since a few weeks ago when the state regularly had more than 9,000 new cases a day, it is still the 13th consecutive day with more than 6,000 new cases of the virus, according to CNN. The state\u2019s department of health says Florida has now recorded a total of 532,806 Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic. Only five countries have recorded more cases than Florida, while the US total passed 5m earlier today. Senate minority whip Dick Durbin has said Democrats face a moral dilemma over whether to challenge Donald Trump\u2019s latest executive actions in court. While some have questioned the legality of the president\u2019s actions, Durbin admitted a legal fight may not be worth it if it means delaying benefits for those in need. \u201cThis is a moral dilemma, we want unemployed people to receive benefits, we never wanted them cut off at all, I\u2019m not going to suggest we run out to court at this point,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. He also criticised Trump\u2019s plan to reduce weekly unemployment benefits from $600 to $400 during the pandemic. \u201cThis country-club fix suggested by the president is going to be a cut in the unemployment benefits for 30 million Americans,\u201d Durbin said. Some Republicans have said the benefits discourage people from working, an accusation Durbin vehemently denied. \u201cThese people are not lazy people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have five unemployed Americans for every available job. This urban legend, which I say is an urban lie, about people sitting at home, binging on Netflix and eating chocolate-covered cherries. Listen, I\u2019ve met with these families, they are desperate to get back to work.\u201d White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has described Donald Trump, who has notched up 284 golf course visits during his presidency, as \u201cthe hardest working president in history\u201d. Navarro was appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press when host Chuck Todd asked him why the president has been at his golf course in New Jersey rather than leading negotiations over an economic relief package. \u201cThis is the hardest working president in history,\u201d said Navarro. \u201cHe works 24/7 in Bedminster, Mar-a-lago, the Oval Office or anywhere in between.\u201d Navarro also said he had heard a theory \u2013 which he would not reveal the source of, possibly because he is the source \u2013 that \u201cDemocrats would prefer to see the economy go into the tank for another 90 days because that harms the president.\u201d With Democrats and Republicans said to be more than $1tn apart on their economic relief packages (Democrats want a higher figure) treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin says his political opponents need to compromise to get a deal done. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been very clear that they need to come back with a compromise on the state and local from their trillion dollars, and the unemployment benefits, and if so we\u2019ll respond. I think the majority of the other issues, we\u2019ve reached a compromise on,\u201d Mnuchin told CNN on Sunday. Mnuchin also appeared on Fox News Sunday to say state governors had told him they did not need as much money as Democrats have suggested. \u201cI\u2019ve also spoke to many governors over the last few days. We offered more money for the states. They still have $150bn from last time. Most of them haven\u2019t even used half of the money,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cThe governors are saying we need more money for education. We need help, and the President said, we\u2019ll give it to you. But not a trillion dollars.\u201d White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has admitted Donald Trump\u2019s executive actions for economic relief may not be legally enforceable. Republican senator Ben Sasse called the orders \u201cconstitutional slop\u201d, while congressman Justin Amash, a Republican turned Libertarian, said Trump was acting like \u201ca king\u201d. On ABC\u2019s This Week, Kudlow said the White House was preparing for a legal battle over the orders but it is \u201cgoing to go ahead with our actions anyway.\u201d Kudlow added: \u201cOur counsel\u2019s office, the Treasury Department believes it has the authority to temporarily suspend tax collections. So we\u2019re banking on that. We\u2019ve had also a repurposing of funds. ... That was decided in our favor in the Supreme Court case regarding the Mexican wall a while back. So we think we can do it,\u201d The Associated Press reports on the incredulity from many in Europe at the failure of the US to get the Covid-19 pandemic under control, particularly given the fact that America is the wealthiest country in the world. Here\u2019s sample from the report, the full version of which you can read here: \u201cDon\u2019t they care about their health?\u201d a mask-clad Patrizia Antonini asked about people in the United States as she walked with friends along the banks of Lake Bracciano, north of Rome. \u201cThey need to take our precautions. ... They need a real lockdown.\u201d Much of the incredulity in Europe stems from the fact that America had the benefit of time, European experience and medical know-how to treat the virus that the continent itself didn\u2019t have when the first Covid-19 patients started filling intensive care units. Yet, more than four months into a sustained outbreak, the US reached the 5m mark, according to the running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Health officials believe the actual number is perhaps 10 times higher, or closer to 50m, given testing limitations and the fact that as many as 40% of all those who are infected have no symptoms. \u201cWe Italians always saw America as a model,\u201d said Massimo Franco, a columnist with daily Corriere della Sera. \u201cBut with this virus we\u2019ve discovered a country that is very fragile, with bad infrastructure and a public health system that is nonexistent.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi has appeared on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. Like her Democrat colleague Chuck Schumer, she is unimpressed with Donald Trump\u2019s executive actions to provide economic relief for Americans during the Covid.-19 pandemic. \u201cEverything is left out,\u201d she said of the actions ordered by Trump on Saturday night. \u201cAssistance to the schools, feeding the hungry, helping people who are going to be evicted. He didn\u2019t do a moratorium [on evictions] he just did a study, a look at a moratorium.\u201d It is still unclear whether Trump\u2019s orders are legally enforceable. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cEither the president doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about \u2013 his aides don\u2019t know what he is talking about \u2013 or something\u2019s very wrong here about meeting the needs of the American people at this time.\u201d Under Trump\u2019s plans, the unemployed will get an extra benefit of $400 a week rather than $600 as was the case until the end of July. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNN earlier today that states have already been allocated enough money to cover $100 of that $400. Pelosi dismissed Kudlow\u2019s claim. \u201cWhat [he] said really shows the weakness and the meagerness of what the president proposed,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst of all he\u2019s saying the states have the money. No they don\u2019t, they have expenses from the coronavirus. They have lost revenue, because of that they are firing health care workers, first responders, teachers, sanitation, transportation workers because they don\u2019t have the money.\u201d Chuck Schumer is followed on ABC\u2019s This Week by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. He defended the president\u2019s actions, saying they would help Americans struggling during the economic crisis caused by Covid-19. \u201c[Trump\u2019s actions] provide significant economic assistance,\u201d he said. Kudlow also aimed a shot at Democrats, indicating they were to blame for the failure of Congress to agree a new economic relief bill. That deadlock, in turn, led to Trump deciding to lay out executive actions on Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of hardship out there there\u2019s a lot of heartbreak out there and the point that President Trump made yesterday, is that on several occasions, we tried to get, for example, a compromise deal on the unemployment assistance\u201d Kudlow said. The US has now passed 5m Covid-19 cases according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The figure was passed a short while ago, and America leads the world by quite some way in cases of the deadly virus. Brazil, the country with the next highest number of cases, has just over 3m in total. India, in third, has recorded just over 2.1m. New Zealand, meanwhile, has gone 100 days without a local transmission. The US also has the highest number of deaths in the world from the virus. Johns Hopkins has the count at 162,000, although others have the figure higher. Brazil has just over 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. For more on how the US has mishandled the pandemic, you can read my colleague Ed Pilkington\u2019s in-depth report: Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has issued a withering assessment of Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of economic relief measures on Saturday. During an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday morning, Schumer said the president\u2019s plans would not do enough to address the financial hardship faced by millions of Americans due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He also called the directives \u201cfaulty\u201d, \u201cunworkable\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d. \u201cThe event at the country club is just what Trump does: a big show, but it doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIf the American people look at these executive orders, they\u2019ll see that they don\u2019t come close to doing the job.\u201d Schumer and House speaker Nancy Pelosi have been spearheading Democrats\u2019 negotiations with Republicans over a new economic relief package. The two sides are at an impasse, with Democrats wanting to spend around $1tn more than the Republicans. Trump\u2019s executive order on Saturday, which is likely to face challenges over its legality, was an attempt to break that deadlock. Schumer was asked on Sunday about whether Trump\u2019s order was legal or not. \u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to the attorneys,\u201d he said. On Saturday, Schumer and Pelosi attacked Trump\u2019s plans in a joint statement. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that instead of putting in the work to solve Americans\u2019 problems, the president instead chose to stay on his luxury golf course to announce unworkable, weak and narrow policy announcements to slash the unemployment benefits that millions desperately need and endanger seniors\u2019 Social Security and Medicare,\u201d they said. \u201cDemocrats repeat our call to Republicans to return to the table, meet us halfway and work together to deliver immediate relief to the American people.\u201d Joe Biden has dismissed part of Donald Trump executive order yesterday as \u201ca reckless war on social security\u201d. The president said he would defer payroll tax through the end of 2020. He has also said he would make permanent cuts to payroll tax if he beats Biden in November\u2019s election. Employer payroll taxes help fund social security. \u201c[Trump] is laying out his roadmap to cutting Social Security,\u201d Biden wrote in a statement. \u201cOur seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without Trump putting their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt.\u201d It remains unclear if Trump actually has the authority to suspends payroll taxes through executive order, and his moves this weekend are expected to be challenged in court.
