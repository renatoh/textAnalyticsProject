We later heard a bemused Japanese tourist suffered great loss of face when he picked one up and used it to mop his brow. But a tentative bite into the Norwegian confection revealed its true identity as a sweet, buttery type of cake, the kind of comfort food that really hits the spot after a day outdoors. Well, appearances can be deceptive and the lefse experience epitomised our visit to the Haugalandet region. Behind the typically Norwegian mix of wild, dramatic landscapes and neat, ordered Trumpton-style towns and villages there are some odd, quirky, sometimes exciting and occasionally crazy things going on. Although this western coastal corner is known as the country's birthplace, its distance from the main airline gateways of Oslo and Stavangar means it has never really featured as a major port of call on the UK visitor trail. A new direct service from London to Haugesund - Haugalandet's largest town - has made it much more accessible, particularly if you don't want to spend hours driving there. Haugesund, which prides itself on having the longest pedestrian street in Norway, owes its prosperity to the 19th-century herring fishing industry, a fact drummed home in the stirring local history film shown at the Lille Maritim cinema in the harbour. So it was quite a surprise, while walking along the waterfront, to be faced with a pouting statue of Marilyn Monroe, rather than the expected swashbuckling maritime bronze. Her father came from the village of Skjold, 20km away, before emigrating to America. After abandoning his family, he was killed in a motorcycle crash without ever seeing his daughter. For a short time she took his surname when she was born Norma Jean Mortensen. And that's not the only film link. Haugesund may not have the chic cachet of Cannes - it is hard to imagine the locals getting involved in air kissing and overly frivolous parties - it is home to the Norwegian International Film Festival. Though it doesn't attract the same outside interest as other festivals in the European film industry calendar, it's a big event for those in the know. Between August 17-24 the ninth festival will see the town's 30,000 population swelled by 14,000 film buffs and celebrities from around the globe. The day before the festival starts Haugesund also hosts the World's Longest Herring Table, stretching for two blocks down the main street. The annual event serves up a fishy feast for the hardy 20,000 who can stomach the 101 herring recipes on offer. Fish is a mainstay on local menus. Another speciality is farik\u00e5l, a simple, filling dish of lamb stewed with cabbage and black peppercorns and served with boiled potatoes. A good place to try it is the atmospheric Naustet Spiseri loft restaurant, at the Rica Maritim Hotel, which also serves up a mean Queen Maud pudding, a creamy, chocolate-laced dessert that's apparently only found in Haugesund. During the summer months Haugesund's cafes and bars are packed with locals making the most of the long, daylight hours before the onset of dark, freezing winters. But watch out, you may find yourself raising you glass and saying sk\u00e5l through gritted teeth; beer costs over \u00a35 a bottle. You can always drown your sorrows, and blot out virtually everything else, with a few shots of the potato and caraway spirit, Aquavit, or the popular herbal firewater Jagermeister, supposedly renowned for their digestive and medicinal properties (aren't they all?). Unfortunately Norway's sky-high drink prices are nothing new, but you can make them more palatable by dining in a suitably lofty location. This year British chef Paul Rhodes (who earned his third Michelin star when he was head chef at London's Chez Nico) and his Norwegian counterpart, Kjartan Kjetland, (known as KK to avoid any pronunciation problems) launched their extreme dining experience on Folgefonna, Norway's third largest glacier. The 140km day trip is interspersed with bracing ferry crossings across fjords. Wrapped up in cold weather gear, available from the summer ski school at the foot of Folgefonna, the more sporty members of our party made their way on skis to the snow-capped dining table while the rest of us hitched a welcome ride on a snow scooter. Champagne and surprisingly gourmet food, given the inhospitable conditions of the outdoor kitchen, were served against a backdrop of breathtaking views from the 1,600m summit. The more energetic can embark on an apres-lunch constitutional with a guided blue-ice glacier walk. On the way back we stopped off at the perfectly preserved village of Aga, home of the lefse cake and farm buildings dating back to the 13th century. For thousands of years the people of Haugalandet have been sailors and merchants. The strait between Haugesund and the island of Karm\u00f8y is called Nordvegen, \"the way north\", which gave the country its name. The area is rich in history and it was here the Viking Harald united Norway as a kingdom. Young visitors may be disappointed to discover that not all Vikings wore horned helmets, wielded ornate shields and fought each other when they were not plundering other countries. The Viking Farm project at Bukk\u00f8y on Karm\u00f8y, 10km from Haugesund by road or ferry, provided an engrossing social history lesson and another incongruous encounter with a Viking named Paul. The former schoolteacher and history expert from Bradford was called in to help set up the project when it started a decade ago and he's been continuing his own educational invasions ever since. We walked along the path from the settlement to St Olav's Church, Avaladnes, a powerful symbol of a bygone kingdom set on a windswept hill where little has changed since it was built in 1250. With a population of less than 4.5 million, equating to 12 people per sq km, Norway is a country where you don't have to travel far to escape any crowds and enjoy nature at its most isolated. At the southernmost tip of the island is Skudeneshavn, a sleepy town where colonial-style buildings are sandwiched in narrow, winding streets. A ship's figurehead dominates the harbour entrance, a reminder of the rich seafaring heritage and the magnificent tall ships that once populated the waters. Modern-day travellers to Haugalandet include Jeremy Irons, Pierce Brosnan, Roger Moore, Ben Kinglsey, Nigel Hawthorne, Jeanne Moreau and Dennis Quaid, joining the other big names at the annual film festival. Now it looks as if the region's opening up to an even wider audience.
