On that occasion, Morshdi had Dermot Weld's Vinnie Roe over six lengths behind him in fourth, giving him a chance against Galileo, who beat Vinnie Roe just over four lengths at Leopardstown before winning the Epsom Derby. Supplemented for today's race at a cost of 90,000 Irish punts, Morshdi won in heavy ground as a two-year-old so the recent softening of the going should not trouble him. Exaltation, who missed the trip to Epsom as he was considered too immature by his trainer, John Oxx, has also been a late addition to the line-up at The Curragh. He finished two places in front of Vinnie Roe when chasing home Galileo at Leopardstown and has since pleased connections in the Gallinule Stakes at the same course. Golan may be better suited to the course at The Curragh than he was by the ups-and-downs of Epsom and is expected to do better on the softer ground but it is hard to see him turning the tables on Galileo. At respective prices, Morshdi and Exaltation both make more appeal. The racing in Britain is altogether more mundane, with a pitiful turnout of four for the Listed Royal Navy 'On The House' Stakes (3.35) at Goodwood. The owner of Frontier Flight, professional punter Stuart 'The Schoolteacher' Holder, is to be congratulated for his placing of his 11-year-old gelding. Frontier Flight, officially rated upwards of 75lbs behind his three rivals, picks up more than \u00a31,500 for completing the course. Holder says: 'Others were put off by the \u00a3150 entry fee. I considered it a bet at reasonable odds.' It is nothing short of disgraceful that a race with \u00a330,000 added prize money has attracted such a small field. But it should still prove competitive and I give the edge to the six-year-old Late Night Out over Cauvery and Proceed With Care. The Vodafone Stewards Cup Trial at 3.0 will be much more of a spectacle with 18 runners over the six furlongs. Zuhair has won four of his last eight outings at this course and may have been trained with the race in mind. His stablemate Flak Jacket bounced back to form at about this time last year after running poorly at Chester - where he ran on his latest start - and he is another to fear, particularly if there is money for him. I side with Surprised , who had Zuhair behind him when winning here in August. Although he is 16lb worse off for just two and a half lengths, Surprised has been in good form this season and looks sure to run his race. Salty Jack came from last to first in the space of a furlong at Kempton last time but hit the front too soon and started to pull himself up and held on by only a head. He was three lengths clear at one stage and Dane O'Neill will come as late as possible on him in the Mail On Sunday Mile Qualifier (4.05). The filly, Dakota Sioux, may prove more of a danger than Kirovski, who is held by Salty Jack on last season's form but who ran well in the Royal Hunt Cup at Royal Ascot last time. For the nap I turn to Ahraydoubleyou in the Find Winners @ GGAlert Novices' Chase at Stratford (4.55). Ahraydoubleyou did us a good turn when winning a handicap at Perth under a big weight last week. There will be no 12-1 this time but Ahraydoubleyou is a confident choice to follow up. Hobart Junction should be attractively priced in the 5.25 with Caxton Star expected to be around evens after winning on his first outing for Charlie Egerton at Market Rasen recently. My selection receives 25lb from Caxton Star and has been in good form at Newton Abbot. Carandrew is the pick of those with recent hurdling form in the 3.50 on his beating of Happicat at Folkestone and fourth to Saragann at Worcester, on which he holds Papua and, through him, Green Card. However, Chief Wardance has won on the Flat at Pontefract this year and has strong claims on his old hurdling form. He was running a big race when falling three out in the race won by Vivo at Worcester just over a year ago and that form ties in with Carandrew, two places behind Vivo in this year's running of the Worcester event."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
