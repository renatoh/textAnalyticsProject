Newman, 83, tried to play down concerns about his health after reports that he was undergoing cancer treatment in New York. But AE Hotchner, who helped create the successful Newman's Own food company in 1982, said the actor had been ill for 18 months. \"It's a form of cancer, and he's dealing with it. Paul is a fighter,\" Hotchner told the Associated Press. Questions about the actor's wellbeing began last month, when he cancelled plans to direct a play at the Connecticut theatre where his wife of 50 years, Joanne Woodward, is an artistic director. The domestic doyenne Martha Stewart, a neighbour of Newman, compounded the concerns when she posted a photo on her blog of the Oscar winner looking thin and pale at a recent party. The actor's spokesman wrote to media outlets this week, telling them: \"Newman says he's doing nicely\" but not directly addressing the cancer reports. Newman recently gave up cigarettes after many years of smoking. All proceeds from Newman's Own salad dressings and snacks go to charity, and the actor has become a leading advocate for corporate philanthropy. Fox news reported this week that Newman gave away $120m during 2005 and 2006. Newman is best known for title roles in The Hustler, Cool Hand Luke and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, in which he played opposite longtime friend Robert Redford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
