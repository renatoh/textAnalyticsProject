Sir Jimmy, it must be admitted, failed to reach the shortlist in any of the poll's five categories: creatives, thinkers, sportspeople, trailblazers and campaigners. He is in distinguished company: Janet Baker, Guy Fawkes, Roy Hattersley, William Hague, Diana Rigg, Arthur Scargill, Herbert Sutcliffe and Fanny Waterman are among those who aren't there either. But the contest, though lighthearted, is striking evidence of two things. The first is the enduring pride of Yorkshire people in their county, their traditions and their sense of belonging. Such pride in county is certainly not unique. From Cornwall to Cumbria, but not everywhere in between, there is a fierce English sense of county fully the equal of Yorkshire's. The second observation is that, in spite of Yorkshire people's achievements in all the five categories in the survey, it is the cluster of \"creatives\" who stand out. The southern stereotype of Yorkshire may be of blunt materialistic folk, but a life-enhancing list that includes Alan Bennett, David Hockney, Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore speaks of a patrimony that is rich in unrivalled ways. This Lancashire-rooted newspaper cannot claim to have a true stake in the Post's contest but, if asked, our vote would be cast for the most creative of all Yorkshire creatives \u2013 Emily Bront\u00eb."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
