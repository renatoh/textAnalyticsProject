Although Sir Alex Ferguson and Paul Scholes looked relaxed at Goodison Park, the United manager waving to supporters during a pitch-side interview and the midfielder taking on five infant Evertonians in a post-match kickabout, confirmation the champions are not entirely comfortable came in the players' tunnel.There stood Rio Ferdinand engrossed in the closing moments of Liverpool's televised game at Fratton Park. The final whistle and the loss of two points by a rival title contender brought a clenched-fist salute and shout of delight from the England defender, a reaction no doubt repeated when Chelsea were later held at home by Blackburn. The margin for error has diminished for United in respect of retaining their title and they are open to outside help while waiting for players and form to return. In the meantime they have taken to the unFerguson-like method of chiselling victory through resilience and set-piece prowess, personified by the 83rd-minute header from Nemanja Vidic that checked Everton's improvement and restored United to top-four prominence. \"We knew we could get a goal like we did. We came for that and we got it\" was the revealing admission from the Serbian centre-half who, with a fine near-post run in a game that had appeared destined for a draw, stole enough space on Joseph Yobo and Tony Hibbert to head Nani's corner into the Gwladys Street goal. Three successive 1-0 wins have repaired United's season while their authority and their penetration have been suspect. Carlos Tevez has worked tirelessly without a telling reward and Vidic and Ferdinand, hugely impressive here, have been their outstanding performers. They now have a platform to progress and, with Wayne Rooney denied his customary Goodison reception in favour of a return against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League on Wednesday, Ferguson has finer options than to partner Ryan Giggs with the Argentinian in attack. \"That's the kind of defending you need to win titles\" was Ferguson's view of a Ferdinand tackle to deny Victor Anichebe an 87th-minute equaliser for Everton. \"Once you do that, and when we get the other top players back and the consistency of performance, we will be OK.\" Ferdinand's intervention arrived with the young Nigerian primed to convert after Edwin van der Sar had parried James McFadden's 20-yard attempt to score his third spectacular goal of the week. That, plus an Andrew Johnson header cleared off the line by Scholes, was as close as Everton came to breaching United's rearguard. With Yakubu Aiyegbeni making his Goodison debut alongside Johnson the new \u00a320m Everton attack combined promisingly before the \u00a311.25m record signing tired. \"We haven't got him at the level we want physically at the moment but for an hour he was a real threat,\" said David Moyes, although the service towards the pair illustrated why the Scottish manager spent much of the summer in pursuit of an accomplished central midfielder, now the one glaring weakness in Moyes's team. The left-back Leighton Baines is proving to be Everton's latest astute purchase at \u00a35m from Wigan, the England Under-21 international ensuring the visitors created few more clear-cut chances than the hosts and playing immaculately against the returning Cristiano Ronaldo, who was booked for exaggerating the effect of contact from Leon Osman. Scholes volleyed United's best effort over the bar at the start of the second half, and might not have been on the pitch at all had Alan Wiley not shown leniency when the midfielder felled Mikel Arteta after collecting a yellow card for dissent. United head for Portugal tomorrow buoyed by the knowledge that they have begun to amend their faltering start to the season. \"Sometimes it's more important not to lose a goal,\" said Vidic. \"The good thing is the midfield and defence are tight and not conceding,\" added Van der Sar. They are sounding, and performing, like the team they replaced as champions.
