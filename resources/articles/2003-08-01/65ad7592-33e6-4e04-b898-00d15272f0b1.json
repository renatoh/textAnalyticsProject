These are the last-minute additions written in to hundreds of welcome speeches made in Faliraki, Rhodes, by a now notorious subset of Brits abroad - the club reps. After record numbers of puke-related incidents this summer, two drink-related deaths and a raft of arrests for lewd behaviour, authorities on the Greek Island are forcing changes on the way in which tour operators sell the island's charms. Emily Dean, 20, a rep for Club 18-30, is in the last two weeks of her contract. \"It's been great - really really good,\" she says, from her hotel in Faliraki. \"The papers are making us look terrible, like slags. But it's fun. Hectic, but worth doing.\" \"Hectic,\" in this context, is something of a euphemism. Dean, a marketing student at Buckinghamshire Chiltern's University, was herself arrested on Sunday night for allegedly breaking the ban on organised pub crawls, during the course of which, say her employers, she suffered an infringement of her human rights. Not sounding overly infringed, Dean insists she is having a wonderful time (she was released without charge) and obeying club rules to the letter. \"We can't drink when we're working. We finish work at 2am, and then you're allowed to have a few. But you've always got to be aware that people are watching you. It doesn't look very good to the guests if you get off your face.\" Getting off one's face has had to evolve to accommodate Faliraki's new laws, which in the same crackdown that landed Dean in trouble, saw Jemma-Anne Gunning taken into custody yesterday for participating in a tourist strip show. The minute the 18-year-old took to the stage to accept her Best Bottom of the Year award, Greek police cruelly swooped in and slapped her with an indecent exposure charge. \"We've had to change our whole approach,\" complains Dean. \"We don't have drinking games anymore. The booze cruises have been banned. There is no bar crawling. Now we take coaches everywhere. We can't walk from pub to pub any more. We put them on a coach at the hotel, and take them straight to the club. If we think someone has had too much to drink we swap the shots for water. It's hard because a lot of people come on these holidays to get drunk.\" Still, some of the quaint old traditions of Faliraki have survived: fish-bowling, for example. \"There are still fish bowls out here,\" says Dean. \"It's just a load of cocktails in a bowl that five or 10 people will share.\" Another word in the club-rep lexicon: chickening. \"Chickening is if you fancy a guest and you stay with them all night. That's a big no-no. You have to be so discreet.\" Apart from you, has anyone else been arrested on your watch? \"Yeah, but I can't really talk about it.\" What were they done for? \"It was fighting, moonies, stuff like that. They got off with a fine. We say to the guests, you've read about the situation in the papers, just watch yourself and know that the police are very strict. You can't even be as crazy as you are at home.\" Do you have sympathy for the locals? \"Yeah. But things like this happen in England all the time.\" Through role-playing exercises and seminars, Club 18-30 trains its female staff in how to deal with leery guests - for example, never swear at hecklers, it only gives them ammunition. \"Most people are just tongue-in-cheek, messing around, but when they take it too far I just walk away.\" Jimmy Kondou, an Australian, has run Jimmy's bar in Faliraki for the past 15 years. He doesn't let the tour groups in. \"On the pub crawls, they get a free shot in every pub and they do about 10 a night; so that really hits them in the head. The crawls are devised by the tour operators to make more money. They charge the tourist a fee to go on the crawl, and they get commission from the bar, so it's in their interests to see them as pissed as possible. It's high-pressure salesmanship and they make a killing.\" Without the tour-group crowd, Kondou says he doesn't even need bouncers in his club. Of all the nationalities on the island, who are the biggest drinkers? \"I'll give you guys the gold medal,\" says Kondou. \"You're bigger drinkers than the Australians. Basically, we drink lager. But you Brits, you hit the spirits.\" Emily Dean, meanwhile, wants to clear her name, and that of the island, which she thinks has been misrepresented. \"We reps have a saying; 'I'd choose sleep over sex', because in Faliraki, sleep is harder to come by.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
