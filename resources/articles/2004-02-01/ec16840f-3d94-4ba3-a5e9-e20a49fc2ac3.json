The show itself is a revered classic. The director is a golden boy whose production of Cabaret wowed New York and whose film of American Beauty won him an Oscar. And the show's star, Bernadette Peters, is something of a local legend although known only to the cognoscenti in London. Yet Gypsy, despite a glowing review in the New York Times, still rates as a mega commercial flop. So what's gone wrong? The first thing to say is that Broadway is in a pretty febrile condition this season. Taboo, the Boy George musical that was a cult hit in London, closes on Sunday having cost its producer, Rosie O'Donnell, in excess of $10m. Bobbi Boland, starring Farrah Fawcett-Majors, didn't even make it to opening night. A one-woman play starring Ellen Burstyn, The Oldest Living Confederate Graduate Tells All, closed as soon as it opened. A revival of Leonard Bernstein's glorious 1953 musical, Wonderful Town, got great reviews but is doing mediocre business. Even the season's one modestly successful play, The Retreat from Moscow, has survived largely on the strength of a stellar performance from our own Eileen Atkins. Old hits like The Producers and The Lion King run on. But this year the maladies of Broadway look as incurable as ever. Producers, as always, have their alibis for failure. Already the premature demise of Gypsy is being blamed on the bitingly cold weather and therefore the reluctance of people to venture outdoors. Matt Wolf, the London theatre critic of Variety, is more realistic. \"Gypsy,\" he says, \"had special problems in that Bernadette Peters was often off sick during previews and the show suffered from the preliminary bad-mouthing that is a feature of New York show-business life. \"But the more general problem is that ticket prices are too high. With tickets costing $100 or more, people are simply going to the theatre once or twice a year instead of once a week. One also has to say that, with the exception of Wicked, based on The Wizard of Oz, many of the shows this season simply haven't been that good.\" Wolf is clearly right: the murderous economics of Broadway mean that people are prepared to pay high prices only for a copper-bottomed hit and that theatregoing has become an event rather than a habit. But I would go even further and say that Broadway has become a tawdry irrelevance in the larger scheme of American theatre. It is mostly a showcase for imported hits from London or the American non-profit sector. Each season - if it's lucky - it generates one golden success: a musical as effervescent as The Producers or a play as good as Edward Albee's The Goat. But the whole notion of the Great White Way as the throbbing heart of American theatre is a myth largely sustained by New York's gift for vainglorious self-publicity. As long ago as 1983, Robert Brustein pointed this out in a piece on the annual Tony awards called Advertising a Dying Industry. Brustein observed that what the Tony awards celebrate is not theatre but box-office returns, with the blockbuster musical (\"Our greatest art form in America,\" according to one awardee) monopolising the honours by virtue of being the biggest potential gold mine. Brustein also lambasted the British preoccupation with Broadway - \"All I can do is purr,\" said Trevor Nunn on picking up an award for Cats - and the failure of the Tony Awards Committee to recognise that American theatre exists outside the 15 New York streets between 41st and 56th. To be fair, there is now a Tony award for best regional theatre. But it is little more than a token acknowledgement of the brutal fact that Broadway is dying and that the action has moved on. In New York itself, the most stimulating theatre is to be found consistently in permanent Off-Broadway institutions like Manhattan Theatre Club, Second Stage or the Public Theatre, the source this year of Tony Kushner's much-lauded new play, Caroline, or Change. There is even more excitement to be found once you jet out of JFK and head west to what I would call the real American theatre. Eighteen months ago I went to the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, run by Dubliner Joe Dowling, to see the premiere of Arthur Miller's Resurrection Blues. The play itself was a vigorous satire on American commercialism dealing with the televised crucifixion of a latter-day Christ. Needless to say, it was shunned by Broadway and patronisingly put down by the New York Times. But, though far from flawless, the play had something vital to say about a money-mad society. Seeing it on two successive nights, I was even more struck by the attentiveness of its audiences for whom theatregoing was clearly a pleasure rather than an expense-account ritual. With the Guthrie soon to expand into a new three-auditorium riverside complex, it will also become America's nearest equivalent to our own National Theatre in London. Last year I felt the same thrill of excitement when I dashed out to Ashland for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival premiere of Continental Divide, David Edgar's two-play cycle about the state of America. Happily, Edgar's twin plays will soon be coming to Birmingham Rep and the Barbican. But what hit me amidships was the bravery of an American regional theatre in commissioning, in conjunction with California's Berkeley Rep, a British playwright to tackle the failure of American political idealism. All this highlights a simple point: that Broadway is no more a true guide to the health of American theatre than the West End is of British theatre. In fact, Broadway and the West End have a good deal in common: both are musical-dominated shop-windows prey to rocketing prices and an insane hit-or-flop syndrome. The West End's situation is not quite as desperate in that it is still possible to stage straight plays in London and that works like Journey's End and Endgame are commercially conceivable. But Broadway is an arid theatrical desert posing as a cultural oasis. And it is high time we realised that, in the wider context of American theatre, there is a world elsewhere. If I can make it there... How they're faring on Broadway Avenue Q Venue Golden Theatre Directed by Jason Moore Last week's attendance 83% Seats cost $21.25-$91.25 Tony awards None What the critics said It has a \"warmth and wit that will disarm the most jaded grown-ups\". (USA Today) Sinking or swimming? Swimming Why? Simple: everyone loves Sesame Street - and Avenue Q is a loving re-creation of Sesame Street. Only, in this show about puppets and humans living together in sweet harmony, all the sex and social angst that was missing from the TV programme comes flooding out. Irreverent songs deal with being gay, internet porn and how we're all, in the end, just a little bit racist. As if that wasn't enough, the main character is a graduate with no idea what to do with his life - a major attraction for that all-important twentysomething audience. Wonderful Town Venue Al Hirschfield Theatre Directed by Kathleen Marshall Last week's attendance 48.6% Seats cost $51-$101 Tony awards None What the critics said \"A buoyant, beautifully staged revival.\" (New Yorker) Sinking or swimming? Sinking Why? Sadly, Wonderful Town proves the despised adage that stars sell tickets. Despite rapturous reviews for previous shows, Donna Murphy hasn't captured the Broadway audience's imagination - or wallets. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Venue Music Box Directed by Anthony Page Last week's attendance 52.1% Seats cost $66.25-$86.25 Tony awards None What the critics said \"This Cat offers thought-plumbing pleasures too seldom found on Broadway these days.\" (New York Times) Sinking or swimming? Sinking Why? Ned Beatty was much-praised for his star turn as Big Daddy. But most people know this play from the Taylor/Newman film: it's sexual tension they're after, not patriarchal magnificence. And while Ashley Judd and Jason Patric look the smouldering part, they just don't act it. Hairspray Venue Neil Simon Theatre Directed by Jack O'Brien Last week's attendance 80.2% Seats cost $25-$100 Tony awards Eight in 2003, including best musical director, best actor and actress in a musical and best musical What the critics said \"Bigger, brighter - and much, much better - than the John Waters film on which the musical is based.\" (Wall Street Journal) Sinking or swimming? Swimming Why? It would be a hard-hearted soul indeed who wouldn't find such an outrageous combination of trash aesthetics, wigs, retro rock'n'roll, teen rebellion and homilies about being nice to each other irresistible. Wicked Venue Gershwin Theatre Directed by Joe Mantello Last week's attendance 95.8% Seats cost $40-$100 Tony awards None What the critics said \"Wicked does not, alas, speak hopefully for the future of the Broadway musical.\" (New York Times) Sinking or swimming? Swimming Why? For once, word-of-mouth appears to be working its trusty magic. Critics carped at this fantasy vision of the good and bad witches of Oz; Ben Brantley of the New York Times was particularly unimpressed, finding the gags leaden, the songs dull, the politics lamentably obvious and the whole thing witless when Kristin Chenoweth, playing Glinda, wasn't on stage. Audiences, though, couldn't care less. Perhaps in post- 9/11 New York, all anyone really wants to see is an old-fashioned battle between good and evil - safe in the knowledge that good is going to win. Taboo Venue Plymouth Theatre Directed by Christopher Renshaw Last week's attendance 58.4% Seats cost $81.25-$101.25 Tony awards None What the critics said \"Those who don't bail out during intermission will be forced to watch a giddy, goodhearted romp degenerate into a preachy melodrama.\" (USA Today) Sinking or swimming? Sinking Why? Where to start? Long before it opened, Taboo was the subject of intense media scrutiny, thanks to explosive battles behind the scenes between the show's producer, Rosie O'Donnell, its star, Boy George, and a rotating cast of directors. Unsure herself that this kitsch show from little old London would make it on Broadway, O'Donnell decided to inject it with American pizazz. But that is no substitute for a good story, which Taboo was now notably lacking. Add to that the extortionate ticket prices and Taboo was doomed to failure. Gypsy Venue Schubert Theatre Directed by Sam Mendes Last week's attendance 48.6% Seats cost $61.25-$101.25 Tony awards Four nominations in 2003, including one for best actress in a musical for Bernadette Peters. What the critics said \"Working against type and expectation under the direction of Sam Mendes, Ms. Peters has created the most complex and compelling portrait of her long career.\" (New York Times) Sinking or swimming? Sinking Why? They're blaming the weather - but those ticket prices can't help. There were also problems from the start with Bernadette Peters: many felt she wasn't suitable for Gypsy's terrifying mother, a role made famous by Ethel Merman. Critics eventually disagreed - but perhaps she needed to win that Tony for audiences to feel she was really worth catching. The Producers Venue St James Theatre Directed by Susan Stroman Last week's attendance A remarkable 101% Seats cost $21.25-$91.25 Tony awards 12 in 2001, including best actor in a musical for Nathan Lane (Matthew Broderick was also nominated), best musical director and best musical. What the critics said \"A big Broadway book musical that is so ecstatically drunk on its powers to entertain that it leaves you delirious, too.\" (New York Times) Sinking or swimming? Swimming Why? It's complicated. In November 2003, attendance was as low as 63%. Basically, the producers of The Producers have found that the only people suitable to replace the original cast, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, are... Lane and Broderick. The winning duo are back in the cast until April; there's a high chance the show will sink again when they leave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
