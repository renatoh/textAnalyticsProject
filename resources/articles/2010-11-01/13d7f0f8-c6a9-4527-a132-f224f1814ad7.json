The awards have a superb track record of identifying talent: early recipients of the composer awards include David Sawer and Simon Holt; while no fewer than 13 artists who received an award then went on to be shortlisted for, or to win, the Turner prize. But they don't just award the young: artists in the middle of their career, such as the marvellous Phyllida Barlow, have received awards at crucial moments. In my speech, I'm going to say exactly what I think about the current government's notion of arts policy \u2013 and it ain't pretty. I'll publish the speech in full on my blog tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
