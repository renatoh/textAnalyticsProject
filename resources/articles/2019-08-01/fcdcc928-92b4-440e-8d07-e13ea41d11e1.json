The allegation was contained within a tranche of just unsealed court papers in a defamation case involving Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite and media heiress accused of procuring underage girls for Epstein and his social circle of the rich, famous and powerful. Maxwell was sued by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre in 2015. Giuffre alleged that Maxwell defamed her by claiming she was a liar. Giuffre had also alleged that Epstein coerced her into sexual encounters with Prince Andrew. Buckingham Palace has repeatedly denied Giuffre\u2019s allegations. In a highly unusual statement issued in 2015, Buckingham Palace said \u201cany suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue\u201d and explicitly denied Prince Andrew ever had sexual contact with Giuffre. \u201cIt is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with [Giuffre]. The allegations made are false and without any foundation,\u201d the royal household later added. Documents filed by Giuffre\u2019s lawyers cite a deposition of Joanna Sjoberg, who also accused Maxwell of bringing her to Epstein. Sjoberg\u2019s deposition testimony, Giuffre\u2019s lawyers said, described allegations involving Prince Andrew. \u201cMs Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her, Prince Andrew, and Ms Giuffre, when she and [Maxwell] were staying at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan mansion,\u201d Giuffre\u2019s lawyers said in the document, which was filed in January 2017. Sjoberg testified, per court documents: \u201cI just remember someone suggesting a photo, and they told us to go get on the couch. And so Andrew and Virginia sat on the couch, and they put the puppet, the puppet on her lap. And so then I sat on Andrew\u2019s lap, and I believe on my own volition, and they took the puppet\u2019s hands and put it on Virginia\u2019s breast, and so Andrew put his on mine.\u201d Giuffre\u2019s lawyers said: \u201cMs Sjoberg\u2019s testimony corroborates Ms Giuffre\u2019s account of how defendant recruited her (and others) under a ruse of a legitimate job in order to bring them into the household to have sex with Epstein.\u201d Giuffre has alleged that Epstein began sexually abusing her when she was 16. The document also contains a photo which, Guiffre\u2019s attorneys say, shows Andrew \u201cwith his hand around Ms Giuffre\u2019s bare waist while she was a minor child, while posing with [Maxwell], inside [Maxwell\u2019s] house in London\u201d. The lawyers said in the papers: \u201cThis particular photograph corroborates Ms Giuffre\u2019s claims, and there is no other reasonable explanation why an American child should be in the company of adults not her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now convicted sex offender.\u201d Maxwell\u2019s lawyer did not respond to three requests for comment. Giuffre\u2019s attorneys did not comment. Epstein\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. Maxwell has denied the allegations. The southern district of New York, which is prosecuting Epstein for alleged sex trafficking, said: \u201cWe\u2019re not a party to this litigation so we can\u2019t comment.\u201d Epstein, who has been jailed since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty in the case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
