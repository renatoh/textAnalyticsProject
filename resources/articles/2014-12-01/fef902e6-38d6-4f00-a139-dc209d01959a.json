CROSSED WIRES OF THE DAY News that Hereford\u2019s suspension had been lifted reached the ears of 167 fans but not the match officials, who believed their game at Dunstable was off and did not turn up. The referee eventually arrived, and the game started half an hour late. FANS OF THE DAY The table may make grim reading for Borussia Dortmund fans \u2013 but 15,000 of them still travelled 200 miles to watch their match at Hertha Berlin. They lost 1-0. IDIOM OF THE DAY Sky\u2019s Alan McInally rolling out an old favourite: shrugging off Burnley v Southampton as a textbook \u201cdamp squid\u201d. FAMILY AFFAIR OF THE DAY Oldham manager Lee Johnson might have fancied his play-off chasers beating dad Gary\u2019s struggling Yeovil. Sunday lunch might be interesting now: Johnson senior came away from Boundary Park with a 4-0 win. VAN OF THE DAY Craig Levein had a reputation for parking buses with Scotland but, now at Cowdenbeath, went one better by tweeting a picture of a club van in the goalmouth of their Central Park ground. It was a means of defrosting the pitch rather than a new tactic, but their match against Hearts was still postponed. GOOD DAY FOR \u2026 Conference North strugglers Hyde: making it two wins on the bounce with a 4-2 FA Trophy mauling of Spennymoor Town. @hydefclive: \u201cEasy, this winning-lark.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
