Even his mother has warned him not to repeat the gesture that riled Scarlets fans when Leicester played in Llanelli last month and the 21-year-old scrum-half is pledging to heed her advice. Youngs, one of several England players who have never experienced Test rugby in Cardiff, treated the crowd at the Parc y Scarlets to a \"shush\" sign after scoring what proved to be a match-turning try. The incident did not go unnoticed in Wales and his opposing scrum-half, Mike Phillips, will be among those intent on silencing the young visitor this time. \"I got told off by my mother and warned never to do it again, so I won't be repeating it,\" said Youngs, eagerly awaiting his duel with Phillips, the Lions' first choice No9 in South Africa in 2009. \"Sometimes you get a bit carried away but, as long as you don't do anything silly that will jeopardise the team or give away three points, there's nothing wrong with a bit of niggle now and then. There may be a little bit of banter around the scrum and he'll probably try and push me around. I expect him to be physical with me and there may be a bit of sledging. \"But as long as you know what's coming your way you can prepare to be in the right place and make sure you're not put off. It's part of the game. Whatever happens on the pitch I'm sure we'll shake each other's hands afterwards and have a good chat.\" Youngs has family honour to uphold, however, his father Nick having ended up on the losing side for England against Wales in the mid-1980s. Last month's Scarlets game also taught him that Anglo-Welsh fixtures are emotional contests. \"In the heat of the moment when you're playing in such a big game between a Welsh club and an English club you get lost in the moment when you score a try. With the hostile atmosphere you're in, you can't help but feel a little bit excited and try to make sure they [the crowd] calm down a little bit. \"We're fully aware as a team how hostile the home crowd will be on Friday. You wouldn't expect anything less. They're a very passionate crowd and they're not scared to shout out a bit of abuse at English people. It makes you aware of what it means to Welsh people. Martin Johnson spoke to us this week about his past experiences in Cardiff, so we know what to expect, rather than running on to the pitch thinking: 'Blimey, why's that bloke doing that?' Both England and Wales will name their teams tomorrow, with Morgan Stoddart standing by to replace the Welsh wing Leigh Halfpenny, who twisted an ankle in training and will miss the first two rounds of the tournament. Youngs is a certainty to start for England and will play a key role in directing operations, physically and verbally. \"I don't think it'll ever be like football where you're chasing the referee 50 metres to tell him what's going on. But you can't help being animated if someone's holding on or he's offside. It's completely instinctive to point and ask: 'What's going on there?' It's not disrespectful to the ref but sometimes you see something that perhaps they didn't.\" In domestic rugby, meanwhile, Bath have confirmed that their Springbok fly-half, Butch James, will leave the club at the end of the season to join the Golden Lions Super 15 side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
