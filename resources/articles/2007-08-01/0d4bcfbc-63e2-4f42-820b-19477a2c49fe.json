Many doubted that he even stood a chance of becoming president of Uefa and are still coming to terms with his desire for diversity. In Monaco tomorrow he is expected to set out proposals that would, in England's case, allow the FA Cup winners to take a Champions League place, from 2009, at the expense of the club coming fourth in the Premier League. There has been a covert nature to this enterprise. The proposals have not yet been circulated among member associations and the precise details are uncertain. It is not established, for instance, that this initiative would apply solely to the countries with four Champions League clubs: England, Italy and Spain. The Scottish Premier League, which sends two sides into the qualifying rounds, is nervous that one of them would in future be the Scottish Cup winners. In Platini's own country, if implemented last season, the system would have pitched little Sochaux into the Champions League. Eggert Magnusson, the West Ham chairman, held the same post at the Reykjavik club Valur when he saw Platini running riot for Juventus against his side in a 1986 European Cup tie. The two men and their wives have been close friends for several years but Magnusson is not in sympathy with the Uefa president over Champions League qualification. \"He will bring in good ideas,\" said the Icelander, \"but there are also some that I would fight. It is my aspiration to see West Ham reach the Champions League by finishing high in the Premier League. I do not believe we should change that system.\" Magnusson doubts if the smaller nations whose votes elected Platini would benefit from a radical restructuring of the Champions League. The Upton Park chairman observes that these countries depend on solidarity payments from Uefa that in turn exist because the glamour of major clubs makes the Champions League lucrative. \"You can't have it both ways,\" he says. \"You cannot expect to keep the same level of income and push out some big teams who create the wealth.\" In his view Platini is exploring options and will know when to abandon the injudicious ones. \"When he first came into Uefa he had to learn a lot,\" said Magnusson. \"It's different being a football politician. Sometimes you have to back off and be quiet. But what I love about him is that he is a football man and it is a great thing for Uefa to have as chief executive someone who played at the very highest level. He is going to be very good for football.\" Platini is undoubtedly a strategist who can reassess. He was shrewd enough to challenge Lennart Johansson in deceptively light-hearted fashion for the presidency and the septuagenarian may have realised the jeopardy he was in too late. When Platini brought his campaign to London last autumn there was no earnest lecture. Instead he invited some journalists to join him for lunch. His manifesto, all five pages of it, looked as if he might have just rustled it up himself over a photocopier. In retrospect we ought to have taken note of the affable, well-designed quips of a candidate determined to hold office. His biggest problem? Getting his wife to leave Paris and set up home near Geneva. His motivation? \"My hair is gone, I've got a big belly, it's time to be president.\" He encourages the misapprehension that he is an ambler. When Platini first won a seat on the Uefa executive committee in 2002 there was no landslide and he saw off Norway's Per Ravn Omdal by 20 votes to 17 in the second round. \"The Uefa establishment did not really support me and I had to go looking myself for the necessary votes,\" he explained. People, as he appreciates, will always listen to him, if only so they can tell Platini how they savour their memories of him in France's great midfield quartet at the triumphant 1984 European Championship. The 52-year-old is an idealist and it would never have come naturally to him to view football as a trial of strength. As a teenager he failed a medical with Metz and the doctor believed there was a heart problem. The muscularity of British teams left Platini cold more recently when he was a Champions League pundit for Canal Plus and it was noticeable how steeply the emotional temperature climbed when he was allowed to speak about an Italian side instead. There is nothing feigned about his high-mindedness. Platini genuinely was dismayed that Lyon should choose to become a public company and, when Francesco Totti retired from international football, the Uefa president commented that Italy's coach, Roberto Donadoni, ought to tell him \"to shut up and play\". Platini was a purist himself when managing a seemingly formidable French team that failed to qualify for the 1990 World Cup or to win a match at Euro 1992. Following that his contribution as joint head of the organising committee for France 98 won him respect as an administrator. Platini does have a core of pragmatism. His relationship with the controversial Sepp Blatter stretches back at least to 1998, when he became personal adviser to the Fifa president. Some treat this as mystery but one long-term observer says: \"It's a marriage of convenience. He gave Blatter legitimacy and Blatter brought him into the group of people who run football.\" Platini cannot be deluded about the sport. A truly egalitarian stance would break the connection between the value of the domestic TV contracts and the sum paid to Champions League clubs from the market pool. Shakhtar Donetsk and FC Copenhagen, for instance, each fell in the Champions League group phase last season but, while the Danes got about \u00a33.5m, the Ukrainians received some \u00a3320,000. No challenge is expected to that principle. It will be a major feat for Platini merely to tweak the rules for Champions League qualification."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
