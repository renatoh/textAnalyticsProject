She counts herself lucky. The Cape Town mother of two has been in prison since January 2015. Within a few days of her incarceration, she was screened and diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB), starting treatment immediately. \u201cI was losing weight, coughing \u2013 but now, with treatment, I am feeling healthy,\u201d says Thompson. Every day she takes six tablets, and by the time she is released in 2016 she hopes to be TB-free. Thompson is one of close to 90,000 offenders who have been screened since 2013 at Pollsmoor prison, where Nelson Mandela was once held. With new technology like the GeneXpert \u2013 a mobile digital x-ray machine \u2013 the prison has conducted 13,215 tests and started 915 patients like Thompson on treatment. \u201cI have to remember to take my tablets, but there is no more coughing and I am feeling good,\u201d she says. But not everyone at Pollsmoor has been so lucky. While awaiting trial at the maximum security prison between 1999 and 2004, Dudley Lee contracted TB. He successfully sued prison authorities (pdf) for damages on the basis that the poor conditions caused him to become infected. In 2012 South Africa\u2019s highest court, the constitutional court, ruled in Lee\u2019s favour (pdf). \u201cThere is a legal duty on the responsible authorities to provide adequate healthcare services as part of the constitutional right of all prisoners to conditions,\u201d it said. The landmark judgment has helped to ensure that prisoners in the country\u2019s largest jail, like Thompson, receive treatment. \u201cOur policies were not clear and TB was a big burden. The Lee case brought some guidelines and now we can see where the burden is and deal with it,\u201d says Geraldine Pienaar, the Western Cape Correctional Service head of development and care. TB is an infectious bacterial disease and, in harsh prison conditions, can be easily passed to others. Pollsmoor prison, located on the outskirts of Cape Town, is one of the oldest in South Africa. It has housed several other liberation-era heroes including Walter Sisulu and Ahmed Kathrada who, along with Mandela, were transferred from Robben Island to Pollsmoor. Mandela himself contracted TB while incarcerated here, in 1988. Overcrowding has always been a problem at the prison. It is intended to house 4,000 prisoners but holds more than 8,000, according to prison authorities. Overcrowding was also highlighted in a recent report (pdf) by an eminent South African judge, Edwin Cameron. He found that Pollsmoor\u2019s remand detention centre, one of the prison\u2019s five complexes, had three times the number of inmates for which it had been built. He said that the \u201cextent of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, sickness and overall deplorable living conditions at Pollsmoor were profoundly disturbing\u201d. Cameron said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d that those detained cannot always access medicines due to persistent lack of basic supplies, including TB medication, and that the same conditions considered in the Dudley Lee case persist, with \u201cthe air so thick one could cut it with a knife\u201d due to poor ventilation. Prison authorities admit that Pollsmoor is overcrowded but say they are doing the best they can under difficult circumstances. The spread of TB is a particular worry in such conditions, as Dr Gareth Lowndes, head of correctional services at TB/HIV Care, acknowledges. \u201cDriven by overcrowding, poor ventilation and too many people, it\u2019s the perfect storm for TB,\u201d he says. The organisation, with financial support from the Global Fund, has been assisting the country\u2019s Department of Health and Correctional Services to deal with the TB problem. Lowndes reports that TB in Pollsmoor is five times higher than the figure for the general population. The country\u2019s health minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, believes there cannot be a business-as-usual approach with TB, which was the country\u2019s leading cause of death in 2013. \u201c[The disease] kills silently, and although the situation is improving we regard the [figures] as still unacceptably high,\u201d he says. According to the health department, South Africa is one of the 22 countries with the highest burden of TB; the country reported 318,000 cases in 2014. South Africa\u2019s national strategic plan for HIV and TB proposed that it targets high risk groups such as mineworkers, and prison staff and inmates. TB/HIV Care is now supporting 95 correctional facilities across the country, including Pollsmoor. Lowndes said: \u201cTime from sputum collection to initiation of TB treatment [has] decreased from a week to less than two days. Time to treatment for drug-resistant TB decreased even more dramatically, from one month to less than a week.\u201d On a visit to the TB screening room at the prison, Motsoaledi commented: \u201cI am happy with the programme to screen more prisoners. The aggressive approach is helping.\u201d The scientific director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Paula Fujiwara, who has worked in prisons across the world, is impressed by the progress made at Pollsmoor in treating the disease, and credits the country\u2019s health minister for his commitment to fighting TB. \u201cSouth Africa is certainly much more advanced [on this issue] than most other African countries and it can be proud that it is at the forefront of TB care,\u201d she says. Fujiwara also believes that South Africa can take a lead in assisting other developing countries in reducing rates of tuberculosis. The battle against TB at Pollsmoor is still very much ongoing, but prisoners like Nomonde Thompson are clearly benefiting from the TB treatment programme. Above all, Thompson wants to be healthy upon her release to be reunited with her children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
