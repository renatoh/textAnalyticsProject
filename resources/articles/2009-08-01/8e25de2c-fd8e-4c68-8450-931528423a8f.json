It's nice to be here. I know it seems a while. That's because it was, but now I'm back and I'm ready to rock. But also folk. And prog. And French chanson. (To the Teutonics among you, can I just state for the record that I had a wonderful time in Berlin, where I became an expert in the consumption of breadrolls and am now a dedicated fan of Augustiner Hell, which, seeing as it's Bavarian, did not go down well with my Berliner pals.) It seems I missed some epic recommending when I was away, but while last week's thread might have been shorter on posts, it was certainly long on good tunes. I had to include Thunder \u2013 I HAD to \u2013 but the rest of the A-list were palpable hits. I apologise now to those who, after Squeeze's failure to make the A-list, will never recommend again. If you are seeking compensation for your loss, however, I am willing to send you each a fiver in the post. Ahem. The B-list Canned Heat \u2013 Going Up the Country Love the wonky falsetto, the tempo and the sunny melody. Not sure that jumping in the water and staying drunk all the time is the best message to send to our youth however. Pavement \u2013 No Tan Lines A characteristically refracted piece of indie pop from Malkmus and co from the beaches of St Tropez. I still don't really understand what it's all about, but it's engrossing all the same. Earth, Wind and Fire \u2013 Getaway Cracking disco funk that does indeed encourage leaving behind the pressure of the city. Though quite where to I'm not sure. To bed, maybe? Lindsey Buckingham \u2013 Holiday Road RIP John Hughes, the screenwriter of the majestic comedy National Lampoon's Vacation, to which this provided the theme tune. I can still see the Griswald's dragging their dog along the highway as I write. Martha and the Muffins \u2013 Echo Beach As redolent of the eighties as The Breakfast Club, and what a great melody line. But is this a holiday or a day trip (and are the two mutually exclusive?) Fiddler's Dram \u2013 Day Trip to Bangor This song was more closely associated with holidaying in the UK than any other when I grew up. Authenticity at it's cheesiest. Squeeze \u2013 Pulling Mussels (From the Shell) As mentioned above! This didn't move me enough for the A-list, the tune just seemed a bit flat, but I can't argue that the lyrics are minutely observed and Jools's solo is ace. Belle and Sebastian \u2013 Piazza, New York Catcher I think they're eloping, not going on holiday but Stuart Murdoch's application of modern argot to traditional folk structures is really beguiling. Connie Francis \u2013 Vacation As evocative as the Beach Boys or Fiddler's Dram of a point in time (well, as evocative as it can be to someone who didn't live through it). The horn solo is gerat. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah \u2013 Yankee Go Home I love the drama of this song, which may detail vignettes of a road trip across the States (and, er, France?). But, also, may not. OK, this week's topic: unlikely cover songs. Now a lot of this will depend on your definition of \"unlikely\". Certainly, Celtic-funk covers of Leonard Cohen tunes would fit the criteria. As would acoustic versions of Napalm Death. However, I think the range can be more subjective than that (providing you can stand it up, of course). For me, Stevie Wonder's cover of We Can Work It Out would be a good example. He switched the genre, though not dramatically, but the way he reinterpreted the emotions that underpinned the track, from melancholy to near ecstacy, was what made it unlikely. I'm in Edinburgh judging the comedy awards (check me blog) but will try to be around on Friday, should peeps be looking for clarification. I will also be back next week. I hope it will be fun. Toolbox: A-Z, Archive, Index, Spill, collabo playlist. Midday Monday is the deadline, don't be naughty with the lyrics, lots of love to you all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
