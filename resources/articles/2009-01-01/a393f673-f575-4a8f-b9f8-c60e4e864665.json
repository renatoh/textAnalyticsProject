The male model, the lorry driver, the postman and the roofer will all have to go back to their day jobs as Histon's giant killing run in the FA Cup finally came to an end. On a churned-up pitch Swansea's pristine white kit was soon slathered in mud, and Roberto Mart\u00ednez's side of well-paid professionals, 64 places above Histon in the pyramid, must have been grateful to have got this over with. \"I'm extremely proud,\" said Mart\u00ednez of his players, \"and delighted with their attitude. In these conditions they had to adapt. It's difficult to show quality on a pitch like this.\" Swansea struggled initially but after last season's defeat against another village side, Havant and Waterlooville, they could not countenance another failure. The home side started brightly, clearly enjoying the underdog tag, and the locals revelled in their own role \u2013 providing the banter \u2013 as supporters ran past Mart\u00ednez's dug-out banging on the perspex and yelling \"sheep shaggers!\" Histon created a few chances to worry Swansea, with Antonio Murray giving the visiting Championship side a scare and forcing a decent save from Dorus de Vries. Murray and De Vries tangled again minutes later as the Histon striker sought to poach a spilled ball from the keeper, but failed to get a foot to it. Damian Reeves and Danny Wright also had chances, but after 23 minutes Swansea took the lead. Gorka Pintado's terrific 30-yard goal had Histon heads dropping, and immediately there was a sense of finality about the proceedings. Just before half time Guillem Bauza added the decisive second. But there remained the odd surprise. Swansea must have thought the game sewn up when late in the second half the referee awarded Nathan Dyer a penalty. But Pintado hit the post and, buoyed by the miss, Histon raced to the other end and promptly scored, lorry driver Josh Simpson poking one in through a scrum of players. It was not enough for the high-flying Conference side and it is Swansea who progress to face cup holders Portsmouth in the next round. \"Our supporters deserve the glamour tie,\" said Mart\u00ednez, \"we are looking forward to it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
