The survey by Vera Baird gives a rare insight into the impact of rape in England and Wales and how it is prosecuted. It also found that about a third of the respondents had not reported what had happened to them to police, with 95% of those saying they had not done so because they did not think they would be believed. Survivors described feeling \u201cangry, hurt and betrayed\u201d by the criminal justice system. \u201cWe already knew the number of rape complaints resulting in a charge was at a record low,\u201d said Baird. \u201cWe were aware the proportion of rape complainants withdrawing their support for a prosecution was at an all-time high. This survey and the voices behind it reveal the extent of the crisis within our justice system.\u201d The government is carrying out an end-to-end review of the treatment of rape in the criminal justice system after a record collapse in charging and prosecutions, but Baird said she had conducted the survey because of the \u201csurprising\u201d decision not to include rape survivors\u2019 voices. One woman decided not to report because when her friend had gone to police after being raped while drunk she had been \u201ctreated like it was her fault\u201d and had been asked what she was wearing. Another said: \u201cMy whole life and identity would have been ripped apart and scrutinised and there would have been a 0% chance of him getting prosecuted.\u201d The survey found many complainants felt like they were being investigated, not the perpetrator. Only 33% said police had clearly explained why a request to access mobile phone and other personal data was necessary, while 22% had been assured that data would only be accessed if relevant and necessary. In July the CPS and police were forced to scrap controversial \u201cdigital strip searches\u201d after a legal threat from two survivors of sexual abuse and campaigning from privacy and human rights groups. One survivor wrote that she felt \u201canxious, confused and infuriated\u201d by the investigation. She added: \u201cI was under far deeper investigation than the rapist [...] They had refused to take physical evidence \u2013 my clothing from the night of the attack \u2013 but wanted to investigate my private life.\u201d Asked if they had been treated with sensitivity, respect and fairness by police at the reporting stage, 48% said yes, 41% said no. But while 57% said they had been kept informed about police actions, 70% said they had to chase for information, while 82% said there were long periods when they heard nothing. A total of 491 rape survivors (including 37 men) completed the survey, which the victims\u2019 commissioner office said was not \u201crepresentative of all rape victims\u201d. In many cases survivors described feeling revictimised by the process \u2013 while the police decisions to take no further action, or a CPS decision not to prosecute was a \u201cdevastating\u201d experience for many. One woman wrote that her independent sexual violence adviser was a huge support but after three months her hair had fallen out, her mouth was full of ulcers and her periods stopped. \u201cThe investigation broke me and it wasn\u2019t worth the pain I had to endure simply to get him spoken to,\u201d she said. Another said: \u201cI felt totally destroyed and I wish I hadn\u2019t reported it. I won\u2019t report it again if it happens.\u201d In total 12% of the respondents saw their case go to trial despite the fact that in England and Wales overall only about 1.5% of rape reports proceed to trial. Some respondents recorded positive court experiences, but despite the fact that cross-examination on previous sexual history was restricted by law, nearly two-thirds of respondents (24 out of 39) said they were questioned about it, while the majority found being cross-examined distressing. One woman who reported a rape in 2015 said she felt unsupported by the prosecution barrister who she met 10 minutes before the start of the trial. From start to finish her experience of the criminal justice system had been \u201ctraumatising\u201d, she said, adding: \u201cI completely understand why people do not report rape to the police.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
