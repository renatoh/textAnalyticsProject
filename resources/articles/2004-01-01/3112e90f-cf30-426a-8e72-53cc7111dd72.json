If successful, it will be the first time the 4,200-mile journey down the world's longest river into the Mediterranean has been completed. The team, led by four South African men and a woman from New Zealand, promised to be \"in the sea within about six months\". The five will be accompanied by a doctor and a film producer. Besides negotiating some of the most powerful surges of white water in the world, the crew hopes to excavate untouched relics of the British colonial era in Sudan. These include derelict steamships abandoned on the Nile after the then governor of Sudan, General Charles Gordon, was killed by Sudanese nationalists in a liberation struggle against Anglo-Egyptian rule in 1885. Gordon had been sent to evacuate Egyptian forces from Khartoum after an uprising led by Muhammad Ahmad al-Mahdi. He was decapitated by rebels in his home. One of the boats known to be lying south off Khartoum is the Malik, a heavily armoured imperial warship sent into Sudan by Lord Kitchener in 1898 to help crush the rebellion. The search for the boat will be the subject of a documentary by team member and British film producer Daniel Prior. The rafters also hope to assess the living conditions of people on the river banks who have been cut off from the world by Sudan's lengthy civil war, on behalf of the international humanitarian agency Care. The seventh team member is Ian Clarke, an Irish doctor of tropical medicine who will carry out research into diseases in remote areas. The explorers will encounter hippopotamuses, Africa's biggest killer, in the jungles of northern Uganda. They will also pass through the crocodile-infested Sudd marshlands of south Sudan. Crew member Natalie McCombe, 31, said another concern was militia groups in Sudan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
