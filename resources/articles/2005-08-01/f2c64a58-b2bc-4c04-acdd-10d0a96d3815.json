But conductor Ingo Metzmacher's performance with the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester, or Youth Orchestra, was an interpretation of such energy, vividness, and infectious enthusiasm that you wondered why this piece isn't played every week by orchestras all over the country. The players of the Gustav Mahler orchestra are the cream of Europe's next generation of musicians. All are under 25 years old, and their commitment and intensity illuminated every bar of Bruckner's symphony. They also inspired Metzmacher to one of his most fluent and insightful performances. The first movement opened with the musical morse code of a nagging violin line, under which a mysterious cello tune ebbed and flowed. Bruckner creates huge rhythmic complexity in this movement, with individual lines playing in different time signatures, but the Gustav Mahler players made this musical complexity sound clear and uncluttered. The moment when the main theme returned in the home key, about two-thirds of the way through the movement, was shatteringly powerful: a radiant peal of brass over a blaze of string sound. The second movement was intensely lyrical, the equal of anything in Bruckner's more famous later symphonies, and the scherzo was a dazzling display of orchestral colour. And the finale may be the most problematic movement in the piece, but Metzmacher carried the music's momentum through to the final, apocalyptic bars. The orchestra were no less accomplished in Mahler's Des Knaben Wunderhorn, with baritone Matthias Goerne. The players relished the slipperiness of Mahler's musical depiction of Anthony of Padua's Sermon to the Fish, a song that cast Goerne as a hapless preacher, and he and the orchestra made the final songs of military life chillingly affecting, especially the last number of a drummer-boy's journey to the scaffold. The whole programme was a testament to the musical togetherness achieved by these young players, and the thrilling immediacy of their playing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
