Authorities summoned the Norwegian ambassador to account for the decision. Screens showing the news on western TV channels \u2013 CNN and BBC World \u2013 went blank. Web links to stories about the Nobel prize were blocked. It is not hard to see why Beijing should react as it did. Although Mr Liu is known and admired among human rights campaigners abroad, he is not, thanks to a powerful apparatus of censorship, a famous figure for most Chinese. Charter 08, the call for democratic reforms that Mr Liu co-authored and which earned him an 11-year prison sentence, is not a widely circulated document. Having the man and his cause flashed all over global media threatened to subvert Chinese information control. Berating the emissary from a small Nordic country, meanwhile, was a way of signalling to the world that friendship with East Asia's economic and military superpower requires tolerance of its authoritarian political arrangements. Most governments have accepted that bargain. One justification for refusing to speak out about human rights in China is the claim that intervention makes matters worse, reinforcing the Communist party's paranoid fear of being undermined from within and helping it present democracy activists as agents of foreign powers. Condemning repression might have limited impact, but turning a blind eye has none. As a technique for dealing with brutal authoritarian regimes, it is a well-tested failure. The truth is that, to many western ears, the clamour of China's markets is louder than the pleas of its dissidents. The Nobel committee is one of few institutions with sufficient status to be heard around the world. Its most coveted prize can now amplify Mr Liu's voice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
