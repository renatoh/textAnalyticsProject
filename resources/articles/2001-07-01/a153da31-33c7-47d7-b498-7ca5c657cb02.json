Japanese girls in pigtails mill about expectantly. Japanese boys with dyed hair loaf around the edges of the room, smoking. The rest of the crowd look like bemused tourists. But Ken's arrival provokes a tremor of excitement. The room goes dark, the video screens flanking the stage shimmer into life, and suddenly we're galloping along to the hustling beat of Iceblink, the opening track of his forthcoming album. It's quintessential Ishii, a carefully calibrated mix of cool synthesisers, oriental melodies and clanging percussion. But Ishii has become almost as well-known for the film and video clips he uses to accompany his music, and the images whirling across the screens alongside him tell any number of stories. There are ranks of animated divers, plunging in unison off a cliff into a pool miles below. There's a computer-generated film of Ishii trying to find his way around an urban cartoonscape. Giant babies' heads are replaced by the snapping jaws of dinosaurs. Animated missiles whoosh into space. Ishii, who was born in Sapporo in 1970, plunged deep into the heart of techno with his 1993 album Garden on The Palm, which gave the world beyond Japan its first inkling that something was brewing. Then he raised the stakes dramatically with Jelly Tones in 1995. He cites the likes of Yellow Magic Orchestra, Front 242 and Kraftwerk as influences, and has earned himself enough of a reputation as performer and DJ to appear alongside Euro-names like Alex Patterson and Richard James. But Ishii has artier aspirations than merely blitzing the dance crowd. His music can rush headlong into crescendos of panicky white noise, but elsewhere the tempo drops and wide open spaces appear as he embraces elements of ambient and New Age. Sometimes the stripped-down beats and aura of hovering calm even suggest that Ishii has been soaking up a little Philip Glass or Steve Reich. Alongside him, his percussionist adds an organic, world-music touch with his tablas. After an hour, Ishii's set reaches its pre-ordained conclusion. He stands, smiles faintly, bows, and is gone. He hasn't spoken a world all evening. Mean Fiddler"}, "isHosted": false}}}
