At a hearing in Canberra on Tuesday, Palmer\u2019s lawyers eventually abandoned the argument, focusing instead on whether the border ban is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d. They were also forced to reframe Palmer\u2019s case to challenge whether WA emergency laws authorise the ban. Palmer\u2019s case has returned from the federal court, which found the border ban was \u201ceffective to a substantial extent\u201d at preventing coronavirus re-entering Western Australia. Palmer\u2019s counsel, Peter Dunning, accepted that finding but argued the court should treat low-risk jurisdictions differently because the ban was no longer necessary for travellers from most states and territories. Dunning argued that there was \u201cno rational basis\u201d to exclude travellers from states such as Tasmania and so WA\u2019s directions were \u201cproperly characterised\u201d as a law to prevent interstate travel, in breach of section 92 of the constitution. Although Dunning accepted that there may be some additional risk from more travellers from low-risk jurisdictions, he argued it was an \u201cacceptable\u201d risk even if one agreed with the precautionary principle set out by the federal court. Justice James Edelman observed that although the WA rules \u201cmight be a little more blunt than [they] need to be to achieve the purpose of preventing Covid-19\u201d, this did not mean the rules were directed at the ulterior motive of stopping interstate movement. \u201cThere is a difference between purpose and effect,\u201d he said. \u201cThe purpose is to prevent the spread of the pandemic \u2026 there is no suggestion that the purpose is to prevent travel into Western Australia although that [is] one of its effects.\u201d Justice Patrick Keane noted that \u2013 unlike the precedent case of Gratwick \u2013 WA\u2019s rules were directed at all travellers arriving in Western Australia, not just those from interstate. Keane said this \u201cmay impact on the character of the prohibition\u201d, suggesting the court was less likely to find it was discriminatory. \u201cOne can see the concern of the legislation and the character of directions made under it is with the emergency, the prospect of the pandemic.\u201d Over the course of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Dunning shifted tack on the purpose of the WA health directions. In the morning, Dunning said justice Darryl Rangiah had been careful to leave the high court room to find the ban was not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for low-risk jurisdictions, despite finding it was effective at preventing re-entry of Covid-19 generally. Several justices raised procedural concerns with the way Palmer had pleaded his case. The chief justice, Susan Kiefel noted that Palmer had challenged the validity of health directions, not the laws enabling them, but section 92 applies to the validity of the laws themselves not directions. Edelman expressed a similar concern, that the mooted constitutional restriction must also apply to the law authorising directions. At first, Dunning conceded the directions were validly made but claimed that they had the \u201ccharacter of legislation\u201d so can be challenged with section 92. After lunch, Kiefel suggested the case could be reframed to argue that if the directions are not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to control or abate the coronavirus risk then there must also be \u201ca question about whether they are authorised by the statute\u201d. \u201cYou could frame it that way, yes,\u201d Dunning conceded. Defending the necessity of the border ban, the WA solicitor general Joshua Thomson highlighted justice Rangiah\u2019s findings that no set of restrictions would be \u201cequally as effective\u201d at preventing the reintroduction of coronavirus. \u201cThere is no finding of fact [by the federal court] that there is zero risk of reintroduction of the virus from low-risk jurisdictions,\u201d he said. Thomson highlighted the \u201creal not fanciful\u201d risk that Covid-19 positive travellers would \u201cborder hop\u201d through low-risk jurisdictions into Western Australia, warning that not all people could be expected to act honestly. He noted justice Rangiah found it \u201cmay be possible\u201d to ease restrictions on lower risk jurisdictions, but Thomson added the judge had not concluded the state \u201cshould or must\u201d do so. He said that is \u201cprecisely\u201d what Western Australia will do from 14 November, when it will reopen to all states and territories except Victoria and New South Wales. People coming from those states will still be required to self-quarantine. Although the federal court made findings in August, the high court will judge the case on the basis of the law and coronavirus risk at the time of the hearing. Thomson argued that changes in September applied tougher exemptions to Victoria and NSW \u2013 proving the measures were calibrated to risk rather than indiscriminately targeting all states. The hearing continues on Wednesday, with submissions from the other states and territories intervening. The federal government pulled out of the case in August under sustained pressure from WA premier, Mark McGowan. Scott Morrison has pleaded with Palmer to drop the case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
