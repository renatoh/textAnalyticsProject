Final warning? What can that mean? What it probably means is that the paper has for some time now wavered. On the one hand there is its loyalty to the PM and the Conservatives, and the fact that hand in glove, they have been able to poison the well over things like welfare reform and migration. On the other, there is the fact that proprietor Rupert Murdoch seems taken, perhaps smitten, with his sometime dining partner, Nigel Farage. This may have seemed something of a cheap thrill before last week's elections, but following the Ukip surge \u2013 and with the party now serious about Westminster and targeting 20 key seats, there really is nothing to stop Murdoch severing the paper's links with the Tories and offering its full-blooded backing to Ukip. Of course the \"Red\" in the Sun's headline might just refer to Labour, but given the paper's nonstop drubbing of Ed Miliband and its distaste for his positions on migration and Europe, that would be a volte-face of extraordinary dexterity. So the PM may lose Scotland, then the Sun and then the general election. That wouldn't be much of a CV would it? \u2022 Farage, meanwhile, continues to bathe in that warm light. Soon he will travel to Brussels, and he must decide whether the election victory gives him licence to break further bread with such as Italy's extreme rightwing Lega Nord. Here in Britain his choices are easier \u2013 and one such has been to nominate his favourite church, as part of the National Churches Trust's \"favourite churches\" initiative. Farage, appropriately enough, chooses St Thomas a Becket Church in Fairfield, Kent. An enchanting attraction, it sits in the middle of nowhere on Romney Marsh. It is also named after a French-speaking saint who returned to Britain only to be assassinated. \u2022 Prince Charles's views on capitalism in a speech to the Inclusive Capitalism conference on Tuesday may have surprised some. \"The primary purpose of capitalism should be to serve the wider long-term interests of humanity, rather than the other way round,\" he said. But the royals have long been free thinkers \u2013 up to a point. After returning from wartime service in the Royal Navy, Prince Philip told his uncle \"Dickie\" Mountbatten that he was not in the least \"antagonistic to principles of socialism\". But there are principles and principles. According to biographer Philip Eade in his book Young Prince Philip, Charles's dad wrote a letter of apology in 1946 to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen mum) and apologised for starting \"a rather heated discussion\". Perhaps not wanting to ruin his chances with her daughter, he wrote: \"I hope you do not think me violently argumentative and an exponent of socialism \u2026 and that you forgive me if I said anything I ought not to have said.\" She obviously forgave him. The rest we know. And he turned saying the wrong thing into a fulltime career. \u2022 Time for the latest edition of the Oldie magazine, and with it a new column by elderly nihilist Wilfred De'Ath. The column itself we can take or leave. What we really enjoy is the promotional material. \"Readers who were shocked by the inoffensive tone of last month's column will be reassured to know that Wilfred is back on form with a column in which he threatens suicide,\" the blurb promises. \"Those who are not appalled at its tastelessness will no doubt be egging him on.\" Makes this column seem like Mary Poppins. They play for keeps at the Oldie don't they? \u2022 Finally, it's all about the fans. Yesterday we told of fans who hurled insults and cheap beer at Hollywood star turned mangler of rock songs Macaulay Culkin. The Scottish singer Paulo Nutini also appreciates some artistic feedback, particularly from his neighbours in Paisley. \"A few weeks ago I saw two guys struggling to carry a washing machine from a secondhand shop,\" he tells Mojo magazine. \"I took my headphones off and grabbed a corner. One of the guys turns around and goes, 'Hang on \u2013 are you that Pablo guy?' I said, 'Yes \u2013 nice to meet you.' He said: 'See half your songs? They're fucking brilliant. See the other half? They're fucking shite.'\" Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
