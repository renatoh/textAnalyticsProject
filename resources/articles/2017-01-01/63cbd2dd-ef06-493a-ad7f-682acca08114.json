A documentary producer, a photojournalist, a live-streamer and a freelance reporter were each charged with the most serious level of offense under Washington DC\u2019s law against rioting, after being caught up in the police action against demonstrators. The Guardian learned of their arrests after reporting on Monday that the journalists Evan Engel of Vocativ and Alex Rubinstein of RT America had also been arrested and charged with felonies while covering the same unrest on Friday morning. All six were arraigned in superior court on Saturday and released to await further hearings in February and March, according to court filings. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said late on Tuesday that charges against journalists who were covering the protests should be dropped. \u201cThese charges are clearly inappropriate, and we are concerned that they could send a chilling message to journalists covering future protests,\u201d said Carlos Laur\u00eda, the CPJ\u2019s senior Americas program coordinator. \u201cWe call on authorities in Washington to drop these charges immediately.\u201d Jack Keller, a producer for the web documentary series Story of America, said he was charged and detained for about 36 hours after being kettled by police at 12th and L streets on Friday morning and arrested despite telling officers that he was covering the demonstrations as a journalist. \u201cThe way we were treated was an absolute travesty,\u201d said Keller, whose cellphone has been kept by the authorities. Keller\u2019s editor, Annabel Park, said: \u201cIt is a maddening and frustrating situation. These are people who were there observing and documenting.\u201d Matt Hopard, an independent journalist who was live-streaming the Friday protests, was arrested at the same site as Keller, Engel and Rubinstein, according to metropolitan police records. He said in a message that he denied the charge against him. Also arrested while covering the demonstrations at 12th and L streets and later charged were Shay Horse, an independent photojournalist, and Aaron Cant\u00fa, a freelance journalist and activist, who has written for outlets including the Baffler, the Washington Spectator and the New Inquiry. Both deny wrongdoing. In all, more than 200 people were arrested on Friday, after property was vandalized in the US capital in the hours around Trump\u2019s swearing-in as president. Police said that six officers suffered minor injuries. The National Lawyers\u2019 Guild accused Washington DC\u2019s metropolitan police department of having \u201cindiscriminately targeted people for arrest en masse based on location alone\u201d and said they unlawfully used teargas and other weapons. \u201cThese illegal acts are clearly designed to chill the speech of protesters engaging in First Amendment activity,\u201d Maggie Ellinger-Locke, of the guild\u2019s DC branch, said in a statement. None of the arrest reports for the six journalists makes any specific allegations about what any of them are supposed to have done wrong. Keller\u2019s report, which also covers the arrests of an unknown number of unidentified other people, includes a note that a police vehicle was vandalized. \u201cI had absolutely nothing to do with the vandalism,\u201d said Keller. Reports on the arrests of five of the six journalists contain identical language alleging that \u201cnumerous crimes were occurring in police presence\u201d. They state that windows were broken, fires were lit and vehicles were damaged. \u201cThe crowd was observed enticing a riot by organizing, promoting, encouraging and participating in acts of violence in furtherance of the riot,\u201d the police reports said. The US attorney\u2019s office for Washington DC, which is prosecuting those arrested, declined to comment on the journalists\u2019 specific cases but said it was continuing to review evidence from the day with the police. \u201cBased on the facts and circumstances, we determined that probable cause existed to support the filing of felony rioting charges,\u201d William Miller, a spokesman for the office, said in a statement. \u201cAs in all of our cases, we are always willing to consider additional information that people bring forward.\u201d Preliminary hearings for Cant\u00fa, Hopard, Horse, and Keller were set for mid-March. Hearings for Engel and Rubinstein were scheduled for mid-February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
