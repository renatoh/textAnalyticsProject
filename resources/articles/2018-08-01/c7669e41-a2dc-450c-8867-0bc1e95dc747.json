Sarri spent three seasons in Naples, twice finishing as runners-up to Juventus and once in third place while improving the club\u2019s record top-flight points haul from 82 to 86 and 91 points each year. His team were praised for their eye-catching, attacking style but failed to win a trophy, a reality bemoaned by De Laurentiis in an interview with L\u2019Equipe. \u201cWe gave Sarri everything and in three years we didn\u2019t win anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThere remains the pleasure of having played well but also the bitterness of not having won anything.\u201d That followed criticisms of Sarri\u2019s approach being \u201cone-dimensional\u201d and was followed by lavish praise of Napoli\u2019s new manager, Carlo Ancelotti. \u201cI don\u2019t know but maybe he is talking about me because he is missing me,\u201d said Sarri, when his former employer\u2019s comments were put to him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win in Naples but we had the record number of points for the club. \u201cWe qualified three times for the Champions League and it was unusual for Napoli. So I think we did very well. Nobody won in Italy except Juventus in the last seven years.\u201d Asked whether he missed De Laurentiis, Sarri said: \u201cAt the moment, no. But I am used [to him].\u201d Sarri confronts another former Napoli manager, his predecessor Rafael Ben\u00edtez, at St James\u2019 Park on Sunday expecting Newcastle to pose a difficult challenge at a ground where Chelsea have not won since December 2011. Eden Hazard, despite impressing off the bench in the team\u2019s two games, is not deemed fully match fit and Ruben Loftus-Cheek will discover only on match day whether he is to be included among the substitutes. The England midfielder, who will learn on Thursday whether he has been retained in Gareth Southgate\u2019s national squad, has been told to fight for his place at Chelsea having been omitted from the 18-man party last weekend. Sarri twice this week spoke to the 22-year-old, who had been interesting Schalke and clubs in Spain and France, and, while offering no guarantees of greater involvement, ruled out another loan move this month. \u201cLoftus-Cheek will remain with us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can speak again about his situation but I think only in December. I am not able to promise anything to anybody. It\u2019s up to him. I usually look at the training and then I decide. So it\u2019s up to him only. \u201cHere the problem is the bench because, in Italy, the players\u2019 list for the match is 23; here only 18. It\u2019s not so easy in this period because we play only once a week. But I told the team that this month they have to be patient. In the future, starting from September, I think we play three times three games a week, so there will be space for everybody.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
