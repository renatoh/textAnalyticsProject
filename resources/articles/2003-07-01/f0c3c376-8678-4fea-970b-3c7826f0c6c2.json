Mates of Oasis, on nodding terms with the phrase \"classic rock'n'roll\", they look to have spent their lives so far leaning moodily against walls in alleyways. All to the good, naturally - and the Atlanta four-piece are now looking to move things on with their new single Clever Kicks, as produced by Oasis man Owen \"Echoin'\" Morris, the king of heavy rock reverb. Manchester University, Oxford Road, Manchester (0161 832 1111) 8pm, \u00a315. Thursday Rooney Power pop has a fairly inauspicious history, one to which Rooney are, in a cheerily shallow kind of a way, only adding. They're a nice looking bunch, and you'll find nothing offensive in their unfailingly melodic, post-Weezer/Dandy Warhols oeuvre, so it's really only their supposed wry wit and well-scrubbed Dawson's Creek-ness that's left to fixate on. Manchester Roadhouse, 8 Newton Street, Manchester (08700 600 100) 8pm, \u00a35. Friday Shack If there's a glamourous side to rock'n'roll, then it's one that Mick and John Head have studiously avoided. Theirs is an indoorsy world of telly watching and noisy neighbours, while their last LP thanked the good people of Cash Converters. Their new one, the brilliantly titled Here's Tom With the Weather, suggests that nothing much has changed in their world, and retains their unassuming high quality of songwriting to boot. Manchester Academy 3, Oxford Road, Manchester (0161 832 1111) 7.30pm, \u00a312. John Robinson Monday Chester Summer Music Festival The young Irish pianist Finghin Collins starts the second week of the festival with a lunchtime recital that includes Brahms, Lennox Berkeley, and the Tempest sonata by Beethoven.

St Mary's Centre, Chester (festival box office 01244 320 700) 1pm, \u00a36. Harrogate International Festival The festival's first week gets under way with a recital today by the young British pianist Freddy Kempf that includes Mozart's sonata in C K330 and Ravel's Valses Nobles et Sentimentales.

That evening, the Northern Sinfonia pays a visit under its director/violinist Thomas Zehetmair with a programme that includes Mozart's symphony no.39 and Bach's double concerto for violin and oboe, with Heinz Holliger as the other soloist. Old Swan Hotel, Swan Road, Harrogate (01423 537 230) 8pm, \u00a312.50-\u00a316. Deal Festival Under the direction of composer David Matthews, the Deal Festival is now offering more in the way of jazz and world music while also expanding its geographical boundaries.

Christopher Lambton Amadeus Tim Luscombe directs revival of Peter Shaffer's tale of intrigue as court composer Salieri finds himself and his talent eclipsed by the arrival of a genius called Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Royal Exchange, St Ann's Square, Manchester (0161-833 9833) 7.30pm, \u00a37.50-\u00a322. My Night With Reg Revival of Kevin Elyot's comedy following the fortunes of a gang of gay friends over three years. A really terrific play, very funny and very painful, that justly won a whole host of awards in the mid-90s. New Vic, Etruria Road, Newcastle Under Lyme, Staffordshire (01782 717962) 7.30pm, \u00a35-\u00a315.

Jessica Lack Le Cercle Rouge Jean-Pierre Melville's terrifically enjoyable noir classic looks even cooler in this re-issue. A treat. (PG) (Jean-Pierre Melville, 1970, Fr) Alain Delon, Yves Montand. 140 mins ***** The Clay Bird Kazi is a doctor in a remote East Pakistan village in the late 60s. In middle age, he has embraced Islam, which brings him into conflict with his nephew. A valuable engagment with Muslim history, this film constitutes a nuanced riposte to the Islamophobia which assumes the Muslim world to be crudely monolithic. (nc) (Tareque Masud,2002, Fr/Pak/ Bangla) Nural Islam Bablu, Russell Farazi, Jayanto Chattopadhyay. 98 mins ***** Etre et Avoir Nicolas Philibert's intimate documentary charts a year in the life of an infant school in rural France. Thoroughly delightful in its simplicity and clarity, yet displaying a deeply intelligent sort of sophistication. A real tonic. (U) (Nicolas Philibert, 2002, Fr) Documentary. 104 mins ***** Secretary A satire, albeit of an ambiguous and pornographic kind, on political correctness, on the power relations of modern work and the sexualisation of the office environment. (18) (Steven Shainberg, 2002, US) Maggie Gyllenhaal, James Spader.104 mins ***** Springtime in a Small Town . A wealthy estate owner in a property that has been extensively damaged in the second world war has his melancholy existence enlivened when his wife's first love comes to call. Spellbindingly tender and utterly involving. (PG) (Tian Zhuangzhuang, 2002, Ch/HK/Fr) Jingfan Hu, Jun Wu. 116 mins ***** Peter Bradshaw Theatre: Sugar Daddies Not just prolific but popular too, theatre's master craftsman Alan Ayckbourn unleashes his 64th creation and it sounds very much like a modern morality play. Sasha is a woman with a kind heart, and when she plays the Good Samaritan and comes to the aid of no less than Father Christmas, she gets her reward. Only it turns out to be more than she ever bargained for: maybe when life's goodies start flying your way there will always be a price to pay.
