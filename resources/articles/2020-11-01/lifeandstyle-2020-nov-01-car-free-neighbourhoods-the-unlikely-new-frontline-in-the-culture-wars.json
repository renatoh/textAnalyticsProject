Training is two miles away, and usually they would travel by car. But, over the summer, the area where they live in Ealing, west London, was designated a low-traffic neighbourhood (LTN). This meant that its streets would be altered to encourage \u201cactive transport\u201d such as cycling and walking, typically by placing planters and bollards across key intersections. The introduction of the LTN scheme in Ealing had created confusion among motorists and congestion on the main roads. It also led Tom to dig out his bicycle, which he bought when he moved to London in 2003 but which had been gathering dust for 15 years. The journey to football was unremarkable, wobbling through unfamiliar streets, scrabbling to make it on time. Cycling back, though, the rain falling harder now, a strange feeling came over Tom. \u201cThere were no cars around,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was dark. It was wet. But it was magical. It was just seeing the place where I live in a totally different light. Everybody\u2019s quite angry at this moment in time, and I just felt \u2013 for the first time in a long while \u2013 that lift and that mood change.\u201d When he and his son got home, they decided they would go on their bikes again the following week. \u201cI hope maybe when he gets older, if we keep it up, he\u2019ll remember cycling to football with his dad,\u201d Tom says. \u201cRather than sitting in the back seat of the car.\u201d It\u2019s a sweet story. \u201cJust something normal,\u201d says Tom, \u201cor something that should be normal.\u201d It\u2019s also exactly the kind of experience that low-traffic neighbourhoods were designed to encourage. There have been similar, albeit more limited, initiatives in the past in the UK, but the LTN proposal only dates back to May this year, when Boris Johnson announced during prime minister\u2019s questions that we would soon be entering \u201ca new golden age for cycling\u201d. He put his money where his mouth was: soon after, the Department for Transport released \u00a3250m of \u201cemergency active travel funding\u201d to English local authorities. Encouraging walking and cycling was now regarded as \u201cessential\u201d to \u201cavoid overcrowding on public transport systems as we begin to open up parts of our economy\u201d. LTN schemes would be trialled in cities including Sheffield, Manchester and Birmingham, but their introduction was deemed particularly essential to London. In May, Transport for London (TfL) needed a government bailout of \u00a31.6bn and was required to institute LTNs as a condition of the recovery package. The fear was that Londoners, wary of using buses and the underground, would take to their cars, causing unprecedented congestion and pollution. TfL outlined a strategy to increase the number of journeys made on foot by a multiple of five, and the journeys made on bike by 10. By the end of the summer, at least 160 new schemes had been introduced across the majority of the capital\u2019s 32 boroughs. It was perhaps the most dramatic reshaping of these streets since the second world war. The scheme generated by Johnson\u2019s Conservative government was rolled out with great enthusiasm by Labour\u2019s mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. At last, something was being done to address the problem of traffic on London\u2019s residential streets, which had increased by 72.2% between 2009 and 2019, and of air quality that had become \u201cfilthy, toxic\u201d and \u201ca public health crisis\u201d, according to Khan. Increasing the use of active transport would make citizens fitter, improve their mental health and give them greater resilience to Covid-19. Low-traffic neighbourhoods were a win, win, win \u2013 one of the few potential positives to come out of the pandemic. Just a few months after the first low-traffic neighbourhoods were introduced, it\u2019s safe to say that few people think they are a miracle policy any more. In Ealing, which was given more than \u00a3600,000 by TfL for active-transport initiatives, opposition has been especially fierce. Planters marking the new road layouts have been defaced and overturned, the bollards have been stolen and the holes left in the road filled in with cement. A march to protest against the LTNs in September had a turnout estimated at 2,500, while more than 10,000 people have signed a petition objecting to the scheme. Low-traffic neighbourhoods have been similarly contentious in other parts of London. John Locker, a Conservative councillor in Wandsworth, said: \u201cIt is clear that the LTNs are not delivering the benefits we want to see. In fact it looks like the combination of changes\u2026 are unfortunately having the opposite effect.\u201d The borough scrapped its scheme in September. Lewisham plans to make significant changes to its LTNs this month. In Hackney, Labour councillor Jon Burke received a death threat over the new measures. \u201cWe intend to burn down your house while you are sleeping,\u201d a scrawled note read. \u201cStop this traffic \u2013 open all road now or we will get violence [sic].\u201d Start looking into low-traffic neighbourhoods and the vitriol, suspicion and chicanery is disturbing. It is no surprise that \u201cTom\u201d from Ealing asks to use an assumed name. \u201cI know a lot of the parents that were marching against the LTNs, even the ones holding the banners,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd you think, \u2018OK, do I really want any hassle or blowback next time we turn up to football?\u2019\u201d Some of the objections to low-traffic neighbourhoods come from predictable sources: motorists, for example, who now find a five-minute errand takes them 20 minutes or who have had a chunk of time added to their commute. Delivery drivers, an essential service in the Covid age, have been inconvenienced by the new measures, forced to adapt to new road layouts while still making their requisite number of drops per hour. But what has been unexpected is the diverse nature of campaigners within the anti-LTN groups. Even some of the individuals themselves are surprised. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah says: \u201cIf you randomly rang me up and said, \u2018Rosamund, what do you think about a low-traffic neighbourhood?\u2019, I\u2019d say, \u2018Ooh, that sounds great definitely.\u2019 But where I live, and I can only talk about Lewisham, it has been a disaster.\u201d Kissi-Debrah is a World Health Organization clean-air advocate whose nine-year-old daughter Ella died in 2013 after suffering a series of severe asthma attacks. She lives in Hither Green, south-east London, just off the South Circular, one of London\u2019s busiest roads. Ella loved to cycle, scoot and skateboard \u2013 \u201cyou name it\u201d \u2013 and her two siblings are similarly \u201cobsessed with two wheels\u201d. Kissi-Debrah follows behind them on a scooter: \u201cA manual one, not electric,\u201d she exclaims. \u201cSo I can\u2019t be anti-cyclist.\u201d For Kissi-Debrah, the issue with low-traffic neighbourhoods is air quality and fairness. \u201cFor people who live in an LTN, yes, life is better, I don\u2019t deny that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut their traffic is going somewhere. And this brings up all sorts of issues: social justice and environmental justice. You cannot live in a neighbourhood where one part has an LTN and children are cycling and playing outside and the roads are safe, then pop along a couple of roads later and there\u2019s gridlocked traffic. We cannot live in a society like that.\u201d Kissi-Debrah\u2019s intervention in the debate appeared to be influential in Lewisham\u2019s ongoing rethink of its LTNs. And she has received considerable opprobrium on social media for her stance. She says: \u201cThis is the hardest time people have given me. But I can only speak my truth. No, some people are not happy with me at all.\u201d Others have told her that she has secured a \u201cvictory\u201d for the anti-LTN campaign, though Kissi-Debrah doesn\u2019t like that angle either. \u201cIt\u2019s not victorious that I know a mother who had to rush her three-year-old to the local hospital to put them on a nebuliser,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want any other family to go through what we went through. That\u2019s my aim all the time, but unless we change things right now I\u2019m not going to get my wish, am I?\u201d Even the most impassioned advocates of LTNs have to concede there have been fundamental problems in some areas. Along with unprecedented investment back in May, local authorities were given the power to introduce the schemes as emergency traffic regulation orders, ostensibly because of the fast spread of Covid and the need to offer social distancing to residents. Typically, consultations on such matters might last months, even years, involving mail-outs, meetings and even local votes. The new LTNs would instead be given a six-month trial and then reviewed. In boroughs such as Ealing, where the council has a stated ambition to become \u201cthe cycling Copenhagen of London\u201d, there were fears that these reviews would be akin to them marking their own homework. \u201cThere\u2019s a set of objections that it was done too fast,\u201d says Dave Hill, editor and publisher of the website On London, which has tracked the LTN debate closely. \u201cSome of them haven\u2019t been very well designed. And some people are furious, because they feel this has been done to them without anybody asking. That\u2019s a small example of a bigger thing, about people feeling that politicians don\u2019t listen to them. \u201cWhere does Covid come in?\u201d Hill continues. \u201cWell, you wonder whether Covid has to some extent given the government cover for forcing certain things through.\u201d Hill also thinks that the typical demographic of the London cyclist has become a factor. According to TfL\u2019s Cycling Trends Update of July 2019, only 27% of cycle trips are made by women and more than 85% of the city\u2019s cyclists are white. A high proportion \u2013 often more than 20% or 30% \u2013 are from households with a yearly income of over \u00a375,000. Some of those opposed to LTNs clearly feel that the schemes encourage gentrification by stealth. \u201cFor some people in some of those areas,\u201d says Hill, \u201cthe whole cycling, clean air, low-traffic neighbourhood agenda is another example of their neighbourhood changing in ways they don\u2019t like and don\u2019t have any control over.\u201d And yet, it also feels like something does have to change. There are, in 2020, 38.4m licensed vehicles in Great Britain; this number has grown every year bar one (1991) since the second world war. In 2019, according to the Department for Transport, 130m more miles were driven in Ealing alone than in 2012. TfL has found that more than a third of all car journeys made by London residents are under 2km (1.25 miles). For a cyclist such as broadcaster Jeremy Vine, who rides at least 14 miles each day between his home and work in London, urban transport in Britain needs to be overhauled. \u201cIn a city as compact as London, you can\u2019t justify people driving around in two-tonne metal boxes with an empty armchair beside them and an empty sofa behind them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just nuts. But once you start to say, \u2018right, if you want to drive in a big metal box, that\u2019s fine, but you can\u2019t go down here, here and here\u2019 people just go completely mad about it. To the point where somebody says, \u2018your neighbourhood is going to be an LTN\u2019 and everyone goes, \u2018you\u2019re fucking joking! I don\u2019t want that.\u2019\u201d Vine would start by reallocating road space and strongly enforcing penalties. \u201cIf you\u2019ve bought a really fancy car to whiz around London, because you want to listen to Bruce Springsteen playing Born to Run, you need to find a different city,\u201d he says. \u201cGo and rent a car in America and you can do that. You can\u2019t do that in our big cities in Britain.\u201d At a glance, Ealing does not appear to be a community in chaos. It is a place of comfortable family homes and sprawling green spaces, plantation shutters and side returns \u2013 still \u201cthe queen of the suburbs\u201d, as the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner noted approvingly. But there are some signs of the current conflict. In many of the bay windows, alongside drawings of NHS rainbows, there are either green posters to show support for low-traffic neighbourhoods (\u201cSafer, Healthier, Quieter, Greener\u201d) or red ones in opposition (\u201cBollards to LTNs\u201d). It is not uncommon for houses next door to each other to have rival posters. I borrow a bike from the Ealing Cycling Campaign, and its borough coordinator, a jovial American called Nick Moffitt, gives me a tour of the most acrimonious spots. We start with an oil slick on a street in west Ealing. Moffitt wrinkles his nose: the police were alerted, but it was impossible to prove whether the oil had been deposited deliberately to unseat cyclists, or had come from, say, a car snagging its undercarriage on the latch fitted to lock the bollard in place. \u201cBut you think, gosh, are we actually this kind of neighbourhood?\u201d says Moffitt. Moffitt, who works in IT, moved to west London in 2006, and his main reason for joining the cycling campaign was to provide safer streets for his daughter\u2019s ride to school. The sabotage of the planters has been unpleasant, even scary, but Moffitt was heartened by the speed at which pro-LTN residents took to the streets to set them right, replant the greenery and water them. \u201cWith these schemes, there always tends to be a moderate-sized number of people who are loudly opposed,\u201d he says. \u201cThere tends to be a smaller group who are loudly in favour, and then a vast majority of people who say: \u2018Well, it seems all right. Let\u2019s wait and see.\u2019\u201d Opinion polls on low-traffic neighbourhoods \u2013 as with everything else on the schemes \u2013 are vigorously disputed, with questions raised over sample size and bias. Broadly though, there seems to be at least theoretical support for them among Londoners. A TfL survey in September found that 51% of respondents agreed with LTNs (subject to a consultation process for individual schemes) with 16% against. A survey of 2,000 residents for On London in October found 52% were broadly supportive of LTNs, while 19% were either opposed or strongly opposed. For Laura Begg, a campaigner for the group Ealing Residents Against LTNs, it comes down to how much your life has been affected by the new schemes. \u201cA lot of the pro-campaigners in this area don\u2019t even live in an LTN,\u201d she says, when we meet in Jay\u2019s Superstore, opposite one of the most controversial spots in west Ealing, or \u201cbollard land\u201d as she calls it. \u201cWhereas everyone in the anti-campaign lives in an LTN.\u201d Begg could seem an unlikely opponent of low traffic neighbourhoods: every day she walks with her two children, aged five and two, to and from school. The family owns, and regularly uses, bicycles. And she has never taken any interest in local politics before. Begg\u2019s annoyance with LTNs comes from her experience running a dog-walking company. Every day, she has to navigate a set of LTNs to collect her dogs, go through more LTNs to get to the park, and then repeat the process on the way home. \u201cToday was horrendous,\u201d she says, with a deep sigh. \u201cI actually sent an email to the leader of the council telling him I was on the verge of having a mental breakdown.\u201d Other local businesses in Ealing clearly feel the same way as Begg, from the owner of Jay\u2019s Superstore to the hairdresser\u2019s on the high street to the local pub. All of them feel the impact of the LTN scheme on their trade at a time when Covid has already made their survival precarious. And Begg reels off other examples of residents whose lives have been adversely affected, such as a disabled woman who missed her hospital appointment in central London because neither of the taxis she called couldn\u2019t reach her house. Now she won\u2019t be seen until April. There has been annoyance, too, at the fines imposed by camera-enforced checkpoints: Lewisham council, for example, issued \u00a33.1m in penalties on the new road layouts in about two months of operation. These are bizarre times in Ealing, and many areas of London. Begg was walking a dog recently through the streets on a Sunday, and saw a cyclist hiding behind a planter taking photos of drivers ignoring the road signs, while a local woman berated him, telling him to stop. \u201cWhat kind of parallel universe are we living in?\u201d says Begg, shaking her head. \u201cBut then I think a lot of this is blocked-up anger from Covid.\u201d Any political unity that existed back in the summer feels shattered. \u201cIt has been jokingly said that the whole thing is a plot by Dominic Cummings to turn people against their Labour councils,\u201d says Rupa Huq, the Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, whose mailbox has seen the objections \u201cfar outweigh\u201d a handful of messages in support. \u201cLarge numbers of my colleagues have also found these schemes contentious.\u201d How this toxic situation resolves itself is likely to differ from borough to borough. Already, the government appears to be going cold on low-traffic neighbourhoods: \u201cNo one should be in doubt about our support for motorists,\u201d wrote the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, last month in a letter to English local authorities. If there is a lesson to be learned from the LTN fiasco \u2013 as both Rosamund Kissi-Debrah and Dave Hill tell me \u2013 it shows what happens when politicians create a policy and don\u2019t bring the people affected along with them. Back in Ealing, Tom hopes \u2013 but doesn\u2019t expect \u2013 that most of the planters and bollards will remain. Either way, he plans to be out on his bike more often, so that\u2019s one less car on London\u2019s roads. \u201cWhen I look back, in 10 years\u2019, 20 years\u2019 time, which side would I have wanted to be on?\u201d he says. \u201cI think I\u2019d want to have been on the one that\u2019s trying to do a bit better. Trying to make this a better place to live.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
