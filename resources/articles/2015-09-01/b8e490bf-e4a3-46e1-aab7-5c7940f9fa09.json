Although suggestions that an old shoulder injury prevented clubs from signing him this summer are believed to be false, senior figures at St James\u2019 Park were worried about Austin\u2019s long-standing knee problem. Knee specialists are understood to have been concerned by scans of the joint but Austin is renowned for never missing a day\u2019s training and the principal reason he is not a Newcastle player already is the fee QPR demanded. Although there was interest from other clubs, including Crystal Palace, no one was willing to meet the original \u00a315m price tag placed on a player starting the final year of his contract at Loftus Road. Given the nervousness surrounding the condition of his knee a last-minute reduction to \u00a312m was still judged too high for the 26-year-old. While Newcastle is believed to be Austin\u2019s preferred choice in January, Papiss Ciss\u00e9 will lead McClaren\u2019s attack when the former England coach renews his acquaintance with Slaven Bilic at Upton Park on Monday night. The Senegal striker was unhappy at losing his place to Aleksandar Mitrovic, who is suspended against West Ham, and had been pursued by clubs in the United Arab Emirates but McClaren was always reluctant to sell Ciss\u00e9. \u201cThere was a lot of speculation about Papiss,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I said from day one to Lee Charnley [Newcastle\u2019s managing director] \u2018flipping heck, if Papiss does go you\u2019ve got to get me a player who can score 11 goals in 22 games as he did last season.\u2019 That\u2019s very difficult in today\u2019s market. When Papiss is focused and fit he\u2019s a threat \u2013 and he\u2019s both at the moment.\u201d McClaren has never analysed Ciss\u00e9\u2019s future with Mike Ashley. Indeed he has only met the club\u2019s owner once \u2013 at a pre-season friendly \u2013 since succeeding John Carver as manager in June. \u201cI met Ashley once before the [M\u00f6nchen] Gladbach game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had 10 minutes\u2019 chit-chat, mostly about Sports Direct and how it makes so much money and how he\u2019s turned this club around in eight years to be in profit and for us to spend \u00a350m and not sell our best player in the last two days of the window.\u201d It served as confirmation that Ashley is now determined to delegate the running of the club to Charnley. \u201cLee Charnley is running the ship here and we\u2019ve got a good relationship,\u201d said McClaren, who has a seat on Newcastle\u2019s board. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see Ashley if he\u2019s got a problem but hopefully that won\u2019t happen. He\u2019s kind of thrown it all over to Lee.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
