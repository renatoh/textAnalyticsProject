Best known for chocolate, strong beers and the European Commission, Belgium is in the throes of a quiet but far-reaching revolution. It may be small (pop. 10 million) and Catholic, but it is well on the way to becoming a society every bit as liberal and laid-back as Holland. And change is being driven from above. The ruling 'rainbow' coalition - Liberals, Socialists and Greens - has orchestrated a change in attitudes and legislation since it came to power in 1999. Gay weddings were made legal the week before last; Belgium became the second country in the world (after the Netherlands) to legalise euthanasia last year; and the government has brought forward controversial legislation authorising the personal use of cannabis. Attitudes to prostitution have been easing. Amsterdam-style window boxes surround Brussels's seedy Gare du Nord, the plush Avenue Louise bristles with escort girls and the area around parliament is dotted with brothels. Amsterdam-style coffee shops have not begun to appear yet, but there are other outward signs of a 'liberal' society. Gay and lesbian bars jostle for space in the centre of Brussels, Antwerp plays host to a raucous gay pride march every year and the smell of mari juana hangs in the air of bars and clubs. 'Belgium has an image as a very small, dull country where nothing happens apart from EU summits,' said Bart Hikspoors, deputy editor of men's magazine Ch\u00e9 . 'But maybe people will start to notice that it has as much, if not more, to offer than other European countries.' Alain Destexhe, a liberal senator from the Mouvement R\u00e9formateur (one of the coalition partners), says the changes are unprecedented. 'It was forbidden to even discuss these kind of matters for the past 50 years,' he said yesterday. 'For too long we had a government dominated by Christian Democrats. They have been in power since the Second World War, with the exception of four years, and they held back change.' Opinion polls show that three quarters of people backed moves to legalise euthanasia. But many Belgians are more lukewarm about gay weddings and, while young people are enthusiastic about the decriminalisation of cannabis, many older people are less sure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
