Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg, current holder of the EU presidency, announced that a new timetable will be reconsidered in mid-2006, suggesting that the constitution is dead or will at best need complete renegotiation. The decision was deeply painful for many EU leaders, and represents a serious defeat for the Franco-German alliance, but reflects the reality that there is no prospect that the treaty will be ratified in the foreseeable future by all EU countries in the wake of the French and Dutch no votes. The EU leaders held back from setting a specific timetable for delay, but also abandoned any suggestion that countries planning to hold referendums should be urged to go ahead. The agreement lifts any lingering burden on Tony Blair to press ahead with his referendum, and represents a victory for him. The Irish, Danish and Luxembourg governments immediately announced they will not go ahead with their planned referendums on the constitution, which was seen only weeks ago as essential to the efficient working of an enlarged EU. At the opening session of the summit, the leaders of the Dutch and French governments opened the discussion by calling for a period of reflection, code for a long-term delay. President Jacques Chirac of France told the meeting: \"I hope we can take a pause for reflection which will allow us to regain the confidence of the citizens.\" He said the French people had voted no, especially its young people, out of fear for the future. The Dutch prime minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, argued that \"hasty decisions will not serve Europe well\". He said that while other countries could continue with their ref erendums if they wished to do, it would be acceptable if they did not want to go ahead. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, who leads the next big country to face a referendum, also called for a period of reflection. \"We do have to face political reality. We cannot proceed as if nothing has happened.\" Their remarks were a relief for Mr Blair, who did not want to lead the charge for the suspension. Speaking early in the debate, he said no one should blame the French or Dutch governments for their defeats, adding they could not have done more to win a yes vote. \"No one can take consolation from the Dutch or French no votes,\" he said. He added: \"Let's get the politics right, then the constitution.\" An agreement to freeze will be seen as a blow to France, Germany and the commission president, Jose Barroso, which had all insisted that the constitution was not over and that each country must proceed with ratification. The agreement goes beyond the previous British demand that the summit agree that each member state be allowed to make its own decision on proceeding with ratification, a position that would have been sufficient for Britain to cancel its referendum without clashing with its EU partners. Mr Blair has been touring European capitals this week arguing passionately for a deferral. He had warned in Paris this week that if referendums went ahead, they would be lost in most countries, a position borne out by polls showing a collapse in support for the treaty. The freeze is also a prag matic admission that there is no chance of France or the Netherlands reversing their no votes by the end of next year. The French are not eager to return to the issue quickly, and did not want piecemeal changes to the EU's procedures to be attempted in the second half of this year for fear it would lead to claims that the constitution was being smuggled in through the back door. On the way to the summit, Mr Blair was finding influential allies. Denmark, with a referendum due on September 27, was one of the first to break ranks. Mr Rasmussen, said: \"I would recommend to have a break in the process.\" Luxembourg had been already in mid-campaign, with its referendum due on July 10. Ireland and Portugal had been scheduled to hold referendums later this year. So far 10 countries have ratified the constitution, but only one - Spain - in a referendum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
