After all the stress of application, assessment and interview, surely choosing between several job offers must be the easy part of the process. Not necessarily. In fact, many graduates report that it can be the toughest. \"It can be a horrendous decision,\" says Mike Hales who is in his final year at Imperial College. \"I've had four offers and although I rejected one of them fairly quickly, choosing between the remaining three was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make.\" Deciding which offer to accept is so difficult because it's often the first time that people encounter this level of decision making. Your choice of GCSEs and A-levels is usually dependent on aptitude while the choice of university is mainly determined by grades. But choosing between job offers is often the first real life-choice that some people have ever made. What then are the strategies that students should use to separate the close contenders? One approach is to contact the companies again to ask for more information. Their differing reactions can tell you a lot. Some companies who have presented a faultless image up to this point can be wrong-footed by your request - revealing a lack of real interest in you. \"When I went through the offer stage I rang all three companies and told them I needed more information,\" says Sarah Hext who graduated from the University of Durham in 1999. \"The first wasn't interested in making any more effort. They just wanted the offer in. The second just put me back in touch with the people who interviewed me, but the third put together a full day's itinerary which included on-site visits and meeting lots of new people who were at different stages of their careers. Guess which one I chose.\" Even if each employer demonstrates an interest in you, graduates report that it is still very useful to talk to as many people as possible. \"Comparing what the graduate trainees say is a really good idea,\" advises Bethan Harris, a final year student at Leeds University who has just chosen Safeway over Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer. \"They are usually happy to be honest, and their enthusiasm should give you a very good indication of what it is really like to work there.\" Another tried and tested technique is to make a list of the pros and cons. \"Just getting things down on paper is a good starting point,\" says Bethan, \"but it's only a guide. Don't base your decision on it.\" \"I did a variation of a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats),\" says Mike Hales. \"But the only trouble with it was that I found it too easy to change the weightings I applied to get the result I thought I wanted that day. I must have changed my mind a dozen times!\" Graduates find these choices so difficult because it isn't simply a question of rationally comparing benefits packages and training schemes. Which job you choose is going to determine your location, your lifestyle, and your self-image for at least the next few years. Mike Hales had to decide between two very different companies: Lloyds TSB and JP Morgan. \"In order to choose between them, I had to ask some serious questions of myself,\" he says, \"like where and who I wanted to be in five years time. I had always wanted to work for JP Morgan, not least because I was attracted by the prestige of the name, but in the end I chose Lloyds TSB because of the exceptional opportunities and personal development that their group management training programme offers.\" Sometimes very different offers can open up the prospect of a lifestyle that you had never thought of before. \"I was on the Cambridge conveyor belt to the City,\" says Susan Alexander who graduated with a law degree in 2000. \"I had two excellent training contracts offered to me, and was about to start the legal practice course when Tesco contacted me and asked if I would consider applying to them. It had simply never occurred to me to think about retail, but I am pleased I did because working for them has given me a completely different lifestyle to the one I would have had in the City.\" But, however difficult you find the decision, don't expect sympathy from your offer-less friends. It's a nice problem to have."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
