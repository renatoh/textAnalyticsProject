The scoreline slightly flatters Arsene Wenger's side, however, who dominated the first-half and took a 2-0 lead through two goals from Lukas Podolski. But Coventry were far better after the break, pressing higher up the pitch and creating chances, the best of which fell to Leon Clarke. Arsenal, however, always had another gear and eventually doubled their lead through late goals from substitutes Oliver Giroud and Santi Cazorla. That's it then. As ever, thanks for the emails. Apologies I couldn't get through them all. Bye! Peep! peep! It's all over at a rain-drenched Emirates. 90 min Arsneal go up the other end and Ozil almost makes it 5-0 with a shot that clips the post. The German is soon back on the ball but is unable to weave through Coventry's defence. 90 min Coventry push forward again, typically though Baker, who plays the ball out to the impressive Christie. He drives into the heart of the Arsenal defence before laying the ball off to Leon Clarke. Unmarked, the striker hits a tame shot at goal which Fabianski is able to easily gather. The look of frustration on his face says it all; Coventry should be leaving north London with a goal at least. 90 min Four minutes of stoppage time to be played. To be fair, it was a great move by Arsenal. The ball was passed quickly from right to left across Coventry's area and after Giroud's shot was blocked, the ball came out to Cazorla who was waiting to smash the ball into the net. And that really is harsh on Coventry. 87 min Cazorla and Giroud hit shots over the bar in quick succession as Coventry make a substitution: Jordan Clarke coming on for Franck Moussa. Quite a lot of 'bird' chat in my inbox. I'll allow Alison Darren to have the final word: \"Male blackbirds are black. Female blackbirds are brown. Fyi, that's all.\" Gibbs and Cazorla linked up down the left, and after the full-back played in a quick, low cross, Giroud was waiting to drill a shot past Murphy from close-range. \"I think Coventry deserved a draw in this second-half,\" says Gary McAllister in commentary. I probably agree with him. A bit unfair on Coventry, that. Good spot by Dan Smith - I should have said that Zelalem is the first Arsenal player to make his debut for the club having been BORN after Arsene Wenger became manager. Others have also spotted my error. Apologies. 79 min Another Arsenal subtitution as Oliver Giroud comes on for Lukas Podolski. The German, quite rightly, gets a decent round of applause. 77 min This game has become quite scrappy now, which is credit to Coventry, who have turned a rout into something of a contest. Baker, who has probably been Coventry's best player, gets the visitors going again with a run through midfield. His subsequent shot goes high and wide, however. Here is David Hytner's very good piece on Gedion Zelalem. 74 min Christie finds himself with more space down Coventry's right. His cross is cut out by Koscielny and he starts an Arsenal attack down their left which leads to nothing. 71 min Double substitution for Arsenal: Santi Cazorla for Nicklas Bendtner and Gedion Zelalem for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Zelalem is the 16-year-old who is supposed to be Arsenal's latest superstar. He also becomes the first player to make his debut for Arsenal after Arsene Wenger became manager of the club. Christ, that makes me feel old. \"Sorry, Sachin, but I left the MBM for 5 minutes to watch the 'How to Attract Birds to your Garden' video,\" pipes up Simon McMahon. \"I learned that blackbirds are so called because they are black, and that if you want to see birds in your garden you should hang a bird feeder where you can see it. I'll not get those five minutes back. You did warn me, though, so it's my own fault.\" Yes I did Simon, yes I did. 68 min Most of Coventry's pressure is coming down their right side, and in particular through Cyrus Christie, the right-back, who like Carl Jenkinson in the first-half, is playing practically like a right-winger. Very high up the pitch. \"Evening Sach,\" says Guardianista Dan Lucas. \"I'm laid up in bed with the mother of all migraines. Nonetheless, Coventry fans won't be in the least bit interested to now you can get a taxi from Coventry to Northampton for\u00a380. As I found out when Bruce Springsteen decided he'd play for nearly four hours last summer. Totally worth it mind.\" Boss email, that. (geddit?). 66 min Coventry are refusing to go away here. The visitors are playing much further up the pitch and pressing harder when they are not in possession. Baker and Christie just combined quite well, meanwhile Steven Pressely is making all sorts of gestures with his hands from the side of the pitch as the rain continues to lash down. 63 min End to end stuff as Wilshere and Podolski combine for an effort. But what's this? It's a fan on the pitch. Well I think so anyway as BT Sport do not show any pictures of the turf-intruder. He, or she, is eventually escorted away and play resumes. 61 min Another chance for Coventry as their fans lead another protest. More aggressive pressing by those in yellow and blue, the ball eventually fell to Daniels but despite the luxury of time and space inside the Arsenal area, the midfielder lumped his shot high over the bar. 59 min \"Come on Arsenal!\" deplore the home fans as they see their team struggling somewhat against lowly opponents. On cue they drive forward - Wilshere plays the ball out to Ozil on the left, who returns the ball. Wilshere then plays in Bentdner who, stationed in a central area inside the Coventry area, spins and hits a shot just wide of the post. \"I used to play football on Friday nights,\" points out John Theodore from Seattle. \"It was a co-ed team, one of 300 or so in the area, and Friday was perfect for couples, but it was an absolute killer for recruiting young single people [women] who could run all night, as they tended to have ideas for their scarce weekend evenings other than being rained on in the mud. \"Since the death of Fox Soccer Channel, games other than regular Premier League fixtures are really hard to find. That\u2019s the only positive thing I have to say about Fox.\" 56 min Clarke hits the post! That all came from more good pressing by Coventry, specifically Moussa on Oxlade-Chamberlain. He eventually squared the ball to Clarke at the edge of the area who hit a drive that clipped the far post as Fabianski looked on helplessly. 54 min A much more even game now. That is partly because Arsenal's level of intensity has dropped a little. They soon pick up the pace and having played a one-two with Podolski, Oxlade-Chamberlain drives into the area but is edged off the ball by Christie. 52 min Hold up in play as Clarke gets treatment. The 28-year-old appeared to hurt his ankle in the aftermath of that chance. As he walks in some pain to the edge of the pitch, Coventry continue to press Arsenal. This is much better from the visitors. 50 min A glorious chance for Coventry! A pass was played through Arsenal's high defence and running through from an onside-position, Clarke suddenly found himself with space down the right side. The striker drove towards goal but, from a narrow angle, hit a shot which Fabianski was able to save with his legs. Decent opportunity, that. 49 min Undeinably a more agressive and positive approach from Coventry at the start of this half. Saying that, Arsenal are soon back on the ball and penning the visitors into their own half. Gibbs whips in a cross from the left. which comes to nothing. Ps: That floodlight failure in the first-half was due to a power surge. 47 min A mistake from Fabianski leads to a Coventry corner, which is taken right in front of the away support. The goalkeeper collects the cross well, however, before being fouled by Seaboune and gaining a free-kick for his side. \"Hope the floodlight failure doesn't lead to Arsenal losing focus. Would hate to end this game wondering 'watt-if...?\". That. from. Adam.White.Is.Marvellous. Second-half underway. Arsenal kick-off. \"I'm not sure how I feel about this Friday football but skipping work [I'm in the US] to watch a game sure is a hell of a way to end the work week,\" says Nate Phillips. Imagine getting sacked for watching Arsenal walk through Coventry? Really hope that doesn't happen Nate! \"Is this a classic case of the videos on the Guardian MBM side bar titled 'How to attract birds to your garden' being more interesting than the game itself?\" Asks Joe Deasy. Possibly ... but stick with me, please! Almost time for the second-half. Until then why not enjoy this video for Arsenal's ridiculously catching 1998 FA Cup final song, 'Hot Stuff' Proof that it's not personal Coventry As expected, a half of utter domination for the Premier League leaders who started slowly but soon found their rhythm and having squeezed Coventry into their own half, took the lead on 15 minutes through Lukas Podolski's left-footed shot. The German made it 2-0 on 27 minutes with a header from a Serge Gnabry corner. Coventry's only effort on goal was a decent long-range shot from captain Carl Baker. That aside, the men in yellow and blue have been chasing shadows in the rain. 45 min In to two minutes of stoppage time as, once again, Arsenal pen Coventry into their own half. 42 min A very rare spell of Coventry pressure leads to a right-sided cross that sails well over Leon Clarke's head as he drifted to the far post. Meanwhile, some of the bulbs have gone in the Arsenal floodlights. \"Pay your bills!\" chuckles Ian Darke in the BT Sport commentary box as some Arsneal and Coventry fans hold up their lit-up phones to make up for the lack of light. It's became that sort of game. 40 min A worry for Arsenal as Wilshere goes down under a challenge from Christie. It was an accident but Wilshere's ankle seem to take quite a whack. The midfielder was on the sodden turf for a while before getting back to his feet. Panic over Gooners. 37 min Podloski comes to close to sealing a first-half hattrick. Once again Jenkinson found space in an advanced right-side position, he played a pass across the area where Podolski was waiting to collect the ball, spin and shoot. Sadly for the German, his effort drifted over the bar. \"As a distant admirer of Coventry back in the 90s shocked by the current troubles of the club, I\u2019d love to see the Sky Blues get something out of today\u2019s game and force a replay...\" says Peter Oh, \"...which would be played ... in Northampton?!\" Indeed. But let's not worry about that eh, Peter. This tie is not heading for anywhere but a confortable home win for Arsenal. 34 min That should have been 3-0. Bendtner played a pass out to Gibbs, who lashed a cross towards the far post where Jenkinson and Gnabry got in each other's way. The former had the shot but it went well, well over. 30 min As expected, the Coventry fans are conducting a protest against their club's owners, Sisu. \"Why?\" is the message held up by those in blue and white in reference to the club currently being based in Northampton. Why indeed. \"I think Friday night is a wonderful time to play football,\" says a clearly out-of-his-mind Simon. \"Particularly as I am in NZ at the moment with freshly brewed coffee in hand starting the day with live football.\" Disagree, but glad you're following the action with me mate. Enjoy. 30 min I honestly would love to mention more Coventry players doing more things but it really is all Arsenal. They are side-stepping, moonwalking, waltzing, through the visitors ranks with ease. Another chance was created but it fell to Bendtner who acted like Bendtner and make a total hash of the effort. Gnabry took yet another corner for Arsenal, this time from their left, Mertesacker flicked the ball on from a position by the near post, and there was Podolski running in at the far to nod the ball into an empty net. Routine. Another goal for Arsenal, another goal for Podolski. 25 min Gnabry has just lashed a shot over the Coventry bar, the visitors have a goalkick, but before you can say 'Chris Kiwomya', the ball is back with Arsenal. The hosts happy just to knock the ball across the pitch and then hit 'TURBO' as they get within a few yards of the Coventry area. Very easy stuff this for the Premier League leaders. Good news folks, I can read your messages again, and first up is this from Gary Naylor: \"What's the crowd like? I'm in Upper Street and there's no sign of any football traffic nor fans. Friday night? Sheesh\". It looks decent mate, a few empty seats but not many. Quite, mind. 22 min Another chance for Arsenal as Gibbs plays in a cross and Ozil glances a header towards goal. It was from some way out and lacked pace, meaning Murphy was able to take the catch easily. 20 min Coventry suddenly causing Arsenal problems. Fleck has just played a very good pass out to Christie on the right flank. The full-back is unable to create an opportunity and the hosts regain possession. But Coventry's players noticeably more aggressive and pressing higher up the pitch. 18 min Coventry have a shot! I did not see that coming. Baker, the Coventry captain, drove forward, kept hold of the ball, and then hit a rising shot from just outside the area which Fabianski had to tip over the bar for a corner. Nothing came from the set-piece but that is more like it from the League One side. 17 min This is going to be one hell of an evening for Coventry, one feels. They've conceded, cannot get near the ball and once again find themselves under pressure against a side purring with class and confidence. Nearly every Arsenal outfield player is currently inside the visitors' half, moving the ball about with confidence. Arsenal won the ball back on the halfway line, Wilshere played a quick pass to Ozil, who played in Podolski and the German, in space in the left channel of Coventry's area, gave Murphy the eyes before slotting the ball past the goalkeeper. Well, that was coming. 14 min Arsenal have had 78% possession - feels like more than that. After a decent start Coventry's players are stuck in their own half and reduced to chasing shadows. They finally get hold of the ball and move it across the back four. \"Ole!\" chant the away supporters, a little ironically. 12 min Another corner and, once again, Jenkinson was the threat. Took Gnabry's pass just inside the Coventry area, looked to play in a low cross but then in came Adams with a sliding tackle. Coventry clear the corner but they simply cannot get out of their own half. An Arsenal goal is on its way folks, no doubt about that. 10 min Jenkinson is finding a lot of space down the right side, and is linking up well with Gnabry. The full-back puts in another cross which Coventry stuggle to clear until Baker eventually hoofs clear. 9 min Arsenal's best chance of the game. Jenkinson drove down the right-flank and whipped a cross into the centre of the six-yard area which Podolski, running into space, volleyed over the bar. The hosts crancking up the pressure. 8 min All Arsenal now as Coventry are well and truly sat in their own half. Arsenal moving it across midfield but struggling to pierce their opponents. Interestingly, Oxlade-Chamberlain is playing in the centre of a very forward-thinking midfield alongside Jack Wilshere. 7 min Another corner from Arsenal as Podolski and Gibbs link up well on the left side. Gibbs plays in a first-time cross which is headed out on the opposite side. Fleck eventually clears the corner and Arsenal have a throw-in back on the left side. 6 min Arsenal's back four pushed right up to the halfway line as the hosts look to pen Coventry into their own half. Generally, though, the Premier League side are not showing a great amount of urgency, moving the ball quite slowly between them. 5 min Coventry survive the corner and soon get up the pitch. Moussa looks to threaten down the left but cannot open up the Arsenal defence and the hosts are soon back on the front foot as Coventry get all 11 players back behind the ball. 3 min Arsenal soon take possession of the orange-and-black ball. Wilshere, Ozil and Oxlade-Chamberlain moving it around quickly across midfield and soon they win a corner as Adams blocks Jenkinson's right-sided cross. 1min Decent start for Coventy who knock it between defence and midfield, resisting some hard pressing from the men in red and white. And we're off. Coventry kick-off, playing right to left as I see it on my TV. Players in the tunnel. Arsenal are in their traditional red and white, Coventry in yellow and blue. Shocking weather in north London by the looks of it. This is the first-ever Friday night game at The Emirates. Not exactly a good thing. Players not quite in the tunnel but Jake Humphrey is standing in front of it like a massive, microphone-clutching obstacle. By the way, this email problem is apparently global. Tut, tut, Gmail, tut, tut. Arsene Wenger explaining his strong line-up: \"It's important when you have momentum that you don't have setbacks.\" A reminder on BT Sport that Arsenal haven't won a trophy since the 2005 FA Cup. Seriously?! That's amazing. People should not talk about that more. Nicklas Bendtner starts. Doesn't he look happy? About 20 minutes until kick-off. Before then, why not enjoy these highlights of Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Coventry from September 1967. Goals from Bobby Gould and George Graham and one almighty foul on the Arsenal right-back straight from kick-off. Bad news folks, the email system has crashed at Guardian Towers so until further notice I won't be be able to access and publish your messages. Apologies. Problem in the process of being sorted. As said, a very strong Arsenal side, despite six changes to the team that beat Fulham 2-0 last week, and there is a return to the first-team following a lengthy period out injured for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Arsenal: Fabianski, Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Wilshere, Gnabry, Ozil, Podolski, Bendtner. Subs: Sagna, Giroud, Viviano, Monreal, Cazorla, Flamini, Zelalem. Coventry: Murphy, Christie, Webster, Conor Thomas, Adams, Moussa, Baker, Fleck, Seaborne, Daniels, Leon Clarke. Subs: Slager, Burge, Barton, Phillips, Willis, Jordan Clarke, Haynes. Referee: Robert Madley (West Yorkshire) ...and here are the Coventry subs Leon Clarke is in and there is a start for Billy Daniels ...and here are the Arsenal subs ...and it's a surprisingly strong one Hello. Howdy, How's things? Yes folks, I'm in place and growling with hunger for some tasty minute-by-minute action. Now I know what you're thinking; \u201cMinute-by-minute? On a Friday? This fella has fallen out of his tree\". Well no. This fella has fallen out of his tree, I, on the other hand, am perfectly sane and ready to bring you coverage of Arsenal v Coventry in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Of course, this fixture should be on a Saturday, maybe a Sunday, at a push, a Monday, but thanks to BT Sport's wild and whacky scheduling it's taking place tonight, on a Friday. Not surprisingly, Coventry fans forced to endure rush-hour traffic in order to make it to The Emirates are not best pleased. Anyway, onwards and upwards, and I for one am intrigued by this encounter, bringing together as it does the Premier League leaders against a side who started the League One campaign in administration-induced turmoil - a transfer embargo, a 10-point penalty and forced to play home games 34.4 miles away at Northampton's Sixfields Stadium being some of the horrors that have subsequently befallen the Sky Blues \u2013 but now sit 11th and boast the second most potent attack in the division, having scored 55 goals in 26 games. Key to the success of Steven Pressley's side has been the form of top scorer Leon Clarke, who has scored 18 times in all competitions this season, so it came as a blow for Coventry fans when the 28-year-old submitted a transfer request earlier this month. So far only Wolves have made an offer for Clarke, but it was rejected and so he remains part of the squad that has travelled to London for this match. Coventry are unbeaten in their last six games, which includes their 2-1 third-round victory over Barnsley on 4 January, but few give them a chance against an Arsenal side that has won all of its last six games and, even with a few changes, should still boast some tip-top talent. History isn't on Coventry's side either, with the Midlands club having lost both of their previous FA Cup ties against Arsenal. Oh, and the last time these sides met, for a Carling Cup tie in 2012, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's men won 6-1. Ouch. Important, though, that Coventry do not give up all hope, and ahead of kick-off it cannot do their fans any harm to think back to that wonderful May day in 1987 when John Sillett's men beat another north London side, Tottenham, 3-2 at Wembley to win their first and still only FA Cup. Below are the goals from the match, alongside a nice little piece from Central News showing that on cup final day, Coventry became a city of zero traffic and quite a few unsold washing machines: Sachin will be with you from around 7pm for the 7.45pm kick-off. In the meantime, here's David Hytner's piece on 16 year-old wonderkid Gedion Zelalem, who is expected to be (a) in tonight's squad and (b) the next Cesc Fabregas. Gedion Zelalem is 16 years old. He has yet to feature in a competitive game for Arsenal, although that could change on Friday night in the FA Cup against Coventry City. He does not even have a professional contract, although that, too, is about to change. When he turns 17 on Sunday, he is due to sign his first professional deal. The pitfalls of promoting him are large and obvious. How can the hype begin so soon? The English media always builds them up to knock them down. It is unfair. The disclaimer, however, rings hollow in this case or, at least, it is overwhelmed by the weight of excitement that has built around this precocious midfield talent. At Arsenal, they dare to believe that they have unearthed their most promising player since Cesc F\u00e1bregas while the story of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's first look at the boy, during his trial at the club, has crackled around football's grapevine. The manager watched for a matter of minutes before he pulled Zelalem's father to one side. \"Your son will play for Arsenal,\" Wenger said. Academy forms would be prepared. He joined upon his 16th birthday last January. You can read the whole piece here. \ufeff"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
