That is a shame but, given the huge second-row's colourful recent past, not all that surprising. This time last year, Mason was comparing Australia's preparations for the Ashes to \"a Contiki tour\", the boozy coach trips around Europe favoured by young antipodean backpackers. That did not go down well with the tour management, but it was trivial compared with the controversy he has courted for most of the subsequent 12 months back home. He became the public face of the gang-rape allegation against his team, Canterbury Bulldogs, even though it had nothing to do with him; he was fined for visiting a brothel after a State of Origin drinking session; details emerged of a positive test for a recreational drug; and finally he was diagnosed as suffering from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and given permission to take another banned substance - Ritalin - to treat the problem. Yet he ended the season as man of the match in Canterbury's grand final win against Sydney Roosters, and after regaining the Test place he had lost he will be one of the main threats at the City of Manchester Stadium tomorrow. After the grand final, the Sydney Morning Herald described Mason as \"one of the most scrutinised, analysed and criticised players in the history of the code\". His career had been eventful enough even before this year, with a representative debut for Tonga in the 2000 World Cup before he shot to prominence two years later with powerful performances almost as eye-catching as the huge Afro which exaggerated his hulking frame. Big Willie wigs were all the rage when he made his Test debut in the 54-10 drubbing of Great Britain in Sydney that July, but by the end of last season there were the first hints of trouble to come when he was in the papers for refusing to pay a taxi fare. However, this year began with a scandal on an altogether different scale - the allegation that a group of Bulldogs players raped a woman during a pre-season trip to Coffs Harbour. The case was dropped for lack of evidence, by which time it had become clear that Mason had been nowhere near the incident. But he had attended a police interview wearing shorts and sandals - and was later fined A$10,000 (\u00a34,100) for \"dressing inappropriately\". It also emerged that he had tested positive for a recreational drug the previous season. But the test had been conducted by his club, not the governing body, so although he was fined A$25,000 by the Bulldogs he escaped suspension. However, it was not long before he was in trouble again, for his role in a \"bonding session\" for the New South Wales team before the first match of the State of Origin series against Queensland. He was far from the worst offender - Anthony Minichiello, who will be at full-back for the Kangaroos tomorrow, was one of two players dropped from the squad for misbehaviour. But inevitably Mason found his own spot of bother and he was fined A$3,000 for returning to the team hotel after the 3am curfew, A$2,000 for unspecified \"further actions\" - which the NSW chairman John Chalk later confirmed as being \"in an inappropriate place\" - and A$1,000 for misbehaviour at an autograph-signing session. However, since then he has not only kept his nose reasonably clean but enjoyed two personal triumphs, winning that Origin series and then starring in the grand final victory. \"He's just grown as a man in my eyes,\" said Phil Gould, the New South Wales coach. \"When I found out what his involvement was in a few things over the past six months, he's done very little wrong and I've got a real admiration for the way he's stuck it out.\" Hugh Hazard, doctor for Canterbury and the Kangaroos, shares those sentiments and while stressing that he could not talk specifically about Mason's condition, explained: \"ADHD is a range of disorders. In schoolkids usually it's the kids who are disruptive in class, usually very poor at things like maths and English, but very good at sport. Figures vary between 2% of children in some studies, and between 5% and 10% in others, and of those a significant percentage go through to adulthood. \"Willie's a rather large man, and very exuberant, and obviously because of his size and his loud voice he stands out in a crowd. But on the other side of the picture, since he accepted his diagnosis he has made huge changes, and that's reflected in the way he's playing footy.\" The wit and wisdom of big Willie 'It's more like a Contiki tour' Mason's view of Australia's preparations for last year's Ashes series, which included boozy stopoffs in Auckland, Barcelona, London and Paris 'All I've done is go out with the New South Wales team, drink a heap of piss and I got into a bit of trouble' His explanation for the A$6,000 fine imposed on him for misbehaviour before this year's first State of Origin game in May 'I don't really give a shit what other people think about me or what they write about me or shit like that. That doesn't faze me, otherwise I would have gone into a cave and just frigging hid' Reflecting on his year at the centre of a Sydney media storm 'We've gone through some shit this year. Thanks to everyone who has stuck behind us. This is what it's all about, holding up this trophy. I love yous all' An emotional podium speech to a packed Telstra Stadium after his man-of-the-match performance in Canterbury's grand final win last month 'I want to party and have a beer with every one of them. I'll probably be out for about two weeks' Mason on his relationship with the Canterbury fans"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
