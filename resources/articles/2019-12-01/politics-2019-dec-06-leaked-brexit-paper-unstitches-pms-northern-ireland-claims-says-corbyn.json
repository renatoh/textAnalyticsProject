The Labour leader said the document revealed the \u201ccold, hard facts\u201d about the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. The document, entitled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access to the UK Internal Market, warns that \u201cthe withdrawal agreement has the potential to separate Northern Ireland in practice from whole swathes of the UK\u2019s internal market\u201d. Corbyn said: \u201cThis drives a coach and horses through Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that there will be no border in the Irish Sea.\u201d The document suggests that for trade going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, the government cannot rule out several different checks, including on regulations and animal health. \u201cAt minimum, exit summary declarations will be required when goods are exported from Northern Ireland to Great Britain in order to meet EU obligations,\u201d it says. And for trade going the other way \u2013 from Great Britain to Northern Ireland \u2013 there could potentially be tariffs, the document suggests. A section headed \u201ceconomic impact on Northern Ireland\u201d suggests high street goods are \u201clikely to increase in price\u201d, and many exporters could struggle with the costs of border checks, which will be \u201chighly disruptive\u201d. The prime minister has repeatedly insisted the Brexit deal he struck in November will not require border checks. He even told one business in Northern Ireland that if they were asked to fill in a form, they should ring him, and \u201cI will direct them to throw that form in the bin\u201d. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, appearing alongside Corbyn at the press conference in London, said: \u201cThe issue of whether there are going to be checks is absolutely blown out of the water by this document, as is the suggestion that it won\u2019t be bad for business. \u201cThis exposes the untruth of Johnson and the evidence is coming from his own Treasury.\u201d The document appeared to have been drawn up to set out the economic and political implications of the government\u2019s promise to maintain \u201cunfettered access\u201d to the British market for business in Northern Ireland. That promise is made in the Northern Ireland protocol that replaced the backstop in Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. At the event in central London, Corbyn also appeared to acknowledge that with less than a week to go until polling day, he was a divisive figure. Asked whether he believed another leader could be more successful among working-class voters, he said: \u201cI think Marmite\u2019s really good for you; some people like it, some people don\u2019t.\u201d Starmer, who has made few frontline media appearances during the campaign, confirmed that he would support remain in a second Brexit referendum, which Corbyn has promised to hold within six months. \u201cI voted for remain last time and I\u2019d do it again,\u201d he said. At a Conservative campaign event near Maidstone in Kent, the prime minister was asked about the documents. He said he hadn\u2019t read them but that Labour\u2019s claims were \u201cnonsense\u201d. \u201cWhat I can tell you is that with the deal that we have, we can come out as one whole UK \u2013 England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, together. We can do free-trade deals together, we can take back control of our borders and our own immigration system. \u201cIf you look at Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposed deal, under no circumstances are he or his colleagues going to take back control of immigration.\u201d He added: \u201cThey should believe exactly what I say, which is that there will be no checks on goods going between GB to NI, or NI to GB, because we are going to come out of the EU whole and entire.\u201d Conservative sources also sought to insist that the documents were not complete. However, Starmer insisted: \u201cHe has either not read the advice from the Treasury or isn\u2019t telling the truth. Probably both.\u201d A senior government source said the document produced by Labour was an \u201cinitial appraisal\u201d compiled by junior civil servants and had not been signed off at a senior level. The Conservative party said the document had been produced immediately after Johnson\u2019s deal was struck and was not written or used for decision-making purposes. They pointed to a number of question marks in the document, which they said showed it was an incomplete analysis. They added that the deal was fully compliant with the Belfast/Good Friday agreement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
