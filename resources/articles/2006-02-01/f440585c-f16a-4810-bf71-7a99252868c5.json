It's a collection of random facts, some of which we've reported on in the paper today. We decided to look at the pressures on twentysomethings to leave home, get a job, get married and have children with the space of a decade, and how women seem to be slightly better at doing that. Over the weekend, the Institute of Public Policy Research published a major report on the decisions women are making about having children and careers. Then, we were told women are having babies too late, and are therefore not breeding enough to keep us in our old age. But at the same time, if women have babies at the ages of 24, they face a \u00a3500,000 \"fertility penalty\". Women can't win. So given the news in the ONS report that so many men are choosing to live with their parents well into their 20s, what are women supposed to do? A man whose mum still does his washing is not exactly an attractive prospect to decide to have a baby with. Women are told to settle down in their 20s, but men are still bragging about having multiple sexual partners, the report says. But there's lots more we could have told you from the ONS research, such as the fact that Britain's Indian population is now the biggest ethnic minority, and the most diverse. Or we could have told you about the inequality in academic achievement between different ethnic groups. Three quarters of Chinese pupils get five good GCSEs, compared with 36% of Caribbean pupils. The research showed we are more mobile than ever - more journeys are being made on most forms of transport, and bus use is rocketing - particularly in London (will mayor Ken Livingstone have anything to say about that?). And although more households are online than ever, the digital divide remains. Internet connection is in 87% of high earners' homes, but only 18% of low earners. We're richer than ever: disposable income rose by 2.1% between 2003 and 2004. But when things go wrong, they go very wrong - the number of insolvencies rose 31% in the same period. The number of people owning second homes abroad (mostly in France and Spain) went up by 45% between 2000 and 2004. And too many of us are failing to eat the recommended amount of vegetables, take daily exercise, or avoid binge drinking.
