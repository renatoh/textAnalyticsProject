Experts who visited the region last month say urgent action is needed to avert a second catastrophe, caused by the likely collapse of the dam under the rising water level. If the dam bursts, it would send millions of gallons of water rushing towards the city of Muzaffarabad, which bore the brunt of the October earthquake. David Petley, of the International Landslide Centre at Durham University, said: \"There is very substantial danger of another serious loss of life. Usually in these cases what happens is that the lake fills to the top of the landslide dam and then spills over the top. Because the landslide is very fragmented, the water cuts down through it and you get a very rapid release of the lake water.\" The lake started to form when a vast avalanche of rocks triggered by the earthquake blocked a river flowing through a valley near Hattian, in the north of the country. Already some 100 metres deep and 200 metres wide, the lake now stretches more than a mile up the valley, about 12 miles upstream of Muzaffarabad. In a report for the Pakistani authorities, Professor Petley and Mark Bulmer, of the Landslide Observatory at the University of Maryland in the US, say: \"We consider that the threat posed by this site is severe, and the consequences of a failure of the dam could be a second large-scale disaster. We feel that urgent action is required and strongly urge the authorities to recognise that a policy of just monitoring is simply not adequate.\" They say a drainage channel - known as a spillway - needs to be built to empty the lake before July, when the monsoon season starts. Studies show that more than 70% of such landslide dams give way, most of them within 12 months. Prof Petley said: \"There is a need to work out how likely it is that the dam will be overspilled, and to work out where that wave is likely to go and how big it will be.\" The rocky dam is about 250 metres high. If all the water was released at once, it would come down the valley as a 250-metre-high wave. That is unlikely, said Prof Petley, but \"it would still be substantially above the normal level\". Refugees living in tents by the river in Muzaffarabad would be in the direct path of the resulting flood surge, he warned. The Pakistani army and the country's Geological Survey, which invited the two scientists to the region to assess the risk, say they are aware of the situation and have pledged to keep an eye on rising water levels in the Hattian lake, and a smaller, second one forming nearby. But Prof Petley said the situation was more serious than they realised and an international effort to drain the lake was needed. The two scientists have also identified other hazards in the region, which is still geologically unstable. One possibility is that the loose valley walls above the lake will give way. \"We're very worried that in the rain a landslide will occur on one of those slopes and displace a wave over the top of the dam. Should that happen then very little could be done but there will be a chance to warn people and get them out of the way,\" Prof Petley said. Monitoring the slopes could give an early warning. Another concern is that several refugee camps in the affected region have been established on areas geologists call alluvial fans: spots where narrow drainage channels open up on to flatter, wider areas. In the event of seasonal heavy rain, these become inundated with a fast-moving mixture of water and rocky debris. The report says: \"These conditions are ideal for the generation of debris flows, which are potentially catastrophic to these communities. The potential for one or more events that cause very high levels of loss of life is critically high.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
