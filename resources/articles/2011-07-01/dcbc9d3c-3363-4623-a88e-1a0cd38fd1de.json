It incorrectly stated that Ken (Lord) Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions, is \"advising News International on how it handles legal claims brought by victims of the NoW's phone hacking\". In fact he has given some advice to the company about the separate issue of allegedly corrupt payments to police on the part of News of the World journalists. \u2022 It was said in an obituary that James Allason succeeded JCC (Viscount) Davidson as MP for Hemel Hempstead. Actually it was Joan Davidson that Allason succeeded; after her husband became a viscount in 1937, she was elected to the Commons seat (8 July, page 40). \u2022 In an article on the management of water in El Paso, Texas, conversions in the editing process from US to imperial gallons resulted in confusion about figures given. The piece, as published, said: \"Per capita water use for the city of El Paso has dropped in the last 20 years from 167 gallons of water a day (754 litres) to 111 gallons. That's barely a quarter of the average daily use in the US, a global water-hog that uses nearly 500 gallons a day per capita.\" These per capita (water use for the entire town, industry, agriculture and so forth) figures were in imperial gallons. Here are the US gallon figures from the story as originally filed: El Paso per capita water use dropped from 201 gallons a day to 133 gallons, and the US uses nearly 600 gallons a day per capita (Heat and dust: but in El Paso, they believe they have beaten drought, 28 June, page 14)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
