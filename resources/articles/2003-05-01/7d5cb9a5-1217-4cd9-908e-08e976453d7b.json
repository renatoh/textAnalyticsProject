Simon Cosyns, a highly regarded art director known as \"the Guru\", is last night believed to have picked up his coat and announced \"I'm off\" following an hour-long meeting with editor Piers Morgan. His decision to leave will come as a blow to the paper - it is believed he will be moving to the Sun where he will take on a larger role encompassing both the Sun and the News of the World. News International confirmed the move - announcing he would be appointed \"Group Associate Editor\" of News Group Newspapers. Rebekah Wade said: \"I am thrilled that Simon is joining us, he is a great talent.\" According to insiders Cosyns had hoped to be made deputy editor of the Sunday Mirror, a post left vacant when Mark Thomas moved to edit the People, and was unhappy when he didn't get it. The job went instead to the Daily Mirror's New York editor, Richard Wallace. \"Everyone here is shocked that Simon walked out. He is a production genius and many of the memorable front pages are his. It is also interesting that Rebekah [Wade], who called a truce in the Sun's war with the Mirror, made a direct play for one of Piers [Morgan]'s trusted lieutenants. But insiders said Morgan did not try to persuade Cosyns to stay after he told him he had been offered a job on the Sun. Wade has conducted her own shake-up of senior executives since she took over in January. Last month she moved one of her predecessor David Yelland's favourites, Graham Dudman, from the position of associate editor (news) to the post of assistant editor (features). Dudman had been one of Yelland's first appointments to the paper and last December was promoted to joint number three alongside head of sport Steve Waring. He has been replaced by Mail on Sunday news editor Paul Field. Wade also bolstered her senior editorial team in January when she brought over the News of the World's pictures supremo Geoff Webster as an associate editor on the Sun. It is not yet clear how Cosyns will work alongside the Sun's existing art director, Joe Madden, who was brought back to the paper by Yelland after he left to join the Mirror."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
