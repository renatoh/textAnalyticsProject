As career choices go, it would probably not be a particularly tough one for most men. As endorsements go, it's a pretty big one for British Columbia's Gulf islands that Eric Klemm chose the latter. \"And Playboy was a big deal in Germany,\" explains the photographer-turned-hotelier. \"It was respected, artistic. When I shot for Playboy, I stayed in five-star hotels, travelled first class, hired helicopters. I was like the late David Hemmings in Blow Up: beautiful women, lots of money, I had an open-top Aston Martin, a Jaguar E-Type. I'd walk into a coffee shop, take a Polaroid of a good-looking girl and ask her if she'd like to come to the Maldives for some photos.\" Yet here he is - standing in the dining room of Aston House, the two-room B&amp;B he now runs with wife Mariette on a little island off Canada's Pacific coast. So ... why? \"Look around you.\" And what a view it is. Squeezed in between the two huge land masses of Vancouver Island on one side and mainland North America on the other, are the 450-odd little green specks that make up the Gulf Islands. Just a dozen or so are inhabited, and even those are only sparsely populated. Aston House is on Salt Spring Island, the most developed of the lot, but from the dining room window you can see nothing but sea, sky and tree. With 225 farms, just one town, countless free-roaming deer and no traffic lights, Salt Spring does textbook \"rural idyll\". A significant proportion of its citizens are, like Eric, refugees from more \"successful\" lives elsewhere. Hundreds live The Good Life, producing organic cheeses, breads, fruit and even edible tulips, and selling them from \"honour stalls\" at the side of the road where you help yourself to the produce and leave the appropriate money (or not). And hundreds more become \"artists\". Why the quote marks? Because if the ex-CEOs are making a living from their cutesy pictures of bears and caribou, I'll eat an overpriced scenic watercolour. There are 35 such artisans on the island's self-guided studio tour, each opening their workshops to the public - and, whatever you think of the quality of the work, even the cynic will enjoy the arts &amp; crafts/reclaim-your-roots atmosphere that pervades. Successive generations of counter-culture refuseniks have washed up on Salt Spring along with the wealthy retirees, so that now, in the main town of Ganges, pierced skatepunks and plaited hippies mix easily with blazered boaters and slacks. The local marijuana, insist smokers, is among the world's best (which may or may not explain the eating of tulips). If the island's self-conscious folksiness occasionally grates (stuck to the changing room mirror in one shop is a handwritten notice proclaiming \"You're perfect just the way you are! Truly!!\"), it more often charms (in the same outlet, thieves are warned in no uncertain terms, \"Shop-lifters will be asked to leave the store!\"). People here are different. Arriving at Apple Hill Farm, another of Salt Spring's 150 B&amp;Bs, we are greeted like old friends - hustled into the family kitchen, fed home-made carrot cake and apple juice, and thoroughly filled in on all the local gossip. We stay just one night (ask for the all-wooden Rose Room; looks a bit like a sauna, has beautiful views over the farm's orchards and gardens), but are actually hugged on departure. If that kind of cosiness isn't your cup of herbal tea, you'll really hate the island's youth hostel (accommodation includes tree houses and teepees), and are much better off at Aston House, which it's almost absurd to call a B&amp;B (twin granite sinks in a five-piece bathroom, fluffy white robes, four-poster bed with super-luxurious cotton sheets handwashed daily, \u00a3800 paintings - for sale - on the walls and even a LAN line for your laptop). But wherever you stay, the view from your bedroom window will beguile. The island is thick with Douglas fir, grand fir, alder, maple, arbutus, broom and western red cedar trees, and the undergrowth looks as lush as it sounds: huckleberry, honeysuckle, salal and Oregon grape all flourish. Down every track, there are placid lakes, vertiginous mountains, rolling pastures and forests so dense that even on the roads through them you need your car's headlights. And there's so much of it to go around, you can spend whole days without meeting anyone. On top of mount Tuam, we find no one to laugh at our absurdly windswept hair; driving through Ruckle Provincial Park to Beddis Beach, our car splits a strand of spider silk that is stretched right across the road; and at Southey Point, the cove is so profoundly quiet - no, so stone cold silent - that I have to throw a pebble into the water to make sure that God has not struck me deaf for having that extra home-baked pastry at breakfast. But Salt Spring was always supposed to be a Shangri-La. Settled initially by a group of American slaves who had bought their freedom, it looked at one stage like being a wholly black colony. That dream never quite came true (and anyway, dreams of freedom don't usually include being murdered by Cowichan indians, who considered the island part of their territory even though they don't seem actually to have lived there). But the isle soon began to live another dream. With life so tough that a man had to get on with his neighbour, there was no room for the casual racism that was one of the luxuries of middle-class life elsewhere in British Columbia. Australians, Portuguese, Hawaiians, Americans, First Nation indians and freed slaves were joined by - and this is not a joke - an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman. The punchline? They all lived together in something pretty close to harmony. Salt Spring doesn't have a monopoly on rustic charm, though. Its neighbouring islands are smaller, quieter and perhaps give some idea of what Salt Spring was like a few decades ago. Travel between them (and the mainland) is by ferry or seaplane, and you should try to sample both. The ferries are a local institution, government-run with a commuter-centric efficiency that never stops them feeling fun; and seaplanes offer spectacular views and the chance to indulge your Indiana Jones fantasies (although, disappointingly, the art deco instrument panel on our De Haviland Beaver, built in 1958, warned that the plane was \"not licensed for acrobatics or spinning\"). Salt Spring's nearest neighbour (at least in terms of ferry connections) is Pender Island. We stopped off there because we liked the sound of Magic Lake and Thieves Bay (plus previous inhabitants, Legs Diamond and Machine Gun Kelly, fugitive Prohibition-era gangsters). And, on a day when we had already effortlessly ticked seals and sealions off our to-see list (from the ferry's car deck), we missed a pod of killer whales by moments, according to those still pocketing their zoom lenses. Catching a beautiful sunset over the virgin forests of some unnamed islet, we hopped across to Mayne Island for a couple of days. Dozy without being dead, Mayne feels like an unofficial national park - and gave us the two best views of our whole stay. At 245m (and 45 minutes' walk through a splendidly Tolkienesque wood) above sea level, Mount Parke's Halliday Viewpoint has a 190 vista and 150-mile view towards the Coastal Mountains (north), Cascades (east), Olympics (south) and America's Mount Baker towering like a textbook snow-capped volcano above them all. And then, from only 5cm above sea level, an even more stunning view. After what their brochure called a \"mini-lesson\" (you'd call it \"the instruction 'Don't capsize' repeated twice\"), an outfit called Blue Vista let us loose for an afternoon with a two-man kayak, route map and binoculars. An unmissably evocative way of seeing the islands - and their waters, and their skies - as their first settlers and native tribes did, you can go whole hours without seeing or hearing a scrap of evidence that it's not 1855, when the settlers arrived - or even 2000BC, when the First Nations did. Leaving Mayne, we stop at Saturna Island (population: 326; artists' workshops: six) just long enough to essay a drive-by scrumping, my companion keeping the engine running while I swipe a couple of russeted beauties off an apple tree overhanging the road. Then, it's on to Galiano Island - closest to Vancouver and the mainland, and perhaps the archipelago's most sophisticated corner. Certainly this is where we have the finest food - prawn and lobster saut\u00e9 with garlic flower and jasmine butter, for instance, at the Galiano Inn, an excellent restaurant/hotel/spa where even the soap makes your mouth water (it smells exactly like a blackberry smoothie). But such refinement is allied to an appreciation of the island's natural attractions: at the equally upscale Woodstone Country Inn, residents or diners can borrow from a \"boot library\" of wellies in all sizes, the better to explore beautiful Montague marine park - a complex of ancient forests and tiny stone beaches so tranquil that I fall asleep on a log and am awoken only by the splash of an inquisitive seal at the water's edge. Reaching for my camera, I think of beautiful women. Nothing unusual about that, of course; it's just that (fleetingly) they don't seem all that appealing.
