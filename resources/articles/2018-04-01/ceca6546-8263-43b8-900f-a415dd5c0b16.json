Rooney did not disguise his anger at being substituted during the goalless draw with Liverpool last Saturday, when 32-year-old was withdrawn in the 57th minute by Allardyce for the second game in succession. The Everton manager, who insists he has no problem with Rooney\u2019s reaction, explained that he wanted \u201cmore legs\u201d in midfield but believes the striker remains better suited to a deeper role. Allardyce, however, also wants Rooney to attack more, with the team\u2019s leading goalscorer having failed to find the target since the defeat of Swansea City on 18 December. \u201cWith his experience he should be dropping deeper and providing goals but I do think he should get into the box more,\u201d said the Everton manager, whose team travel to Swansea on Saturday. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t scored since Swansea and not scored from open play since Newcastle [13 December] and I would like him to get forward a little bit more. Certainly in the games we are controlling more and attacking more I would like him further up the pitch but he is also one of our best passers. I would like that combination to get bigger, certainly from a goalscoring point of view.\u201d Rooney has scored 11 goals this season \u2013 three from the penalty spot \u2013 with Oumar Niasse Everton\u2019s second highest scorer with eight. Allardyce added: \u201cWe\u2019ve only got Wayne in double figures and that\u2019s because of penalties. If you\u2019re going to get into Europe you can\u2019t get there without two players getting into double figures \u2013 minimum \u2013 so that\u2019s been a massive struggle this year. We haven\u2019t got anyone who has come close to scoring the amount of goals that [Romelu] Lukaku got last year and that\u2019s why our defending has to be so much better. It doesn\u2019t need an experienced manager like me to work that one out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
