Minutes after Pell\u2019s conviction was quashed by the high court, the News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt posted a blog saying the cardinal was innocent and pointing the finger at the ABC for allegedly conducting a witch-hunt to have him convicted. Bolt, who has an exclusive interview with Pell on his Sky News program at a date yet to be announced, said the national broadcaster had \u201cwith one voice persecuted him for years with false claims and never once had a presenter express doubt about this crusade to destroy him\u201d. \u201cShame on the ABC, our national broadcaster, for hysterically pushing damaging claims against Pell that all turned out to be too absurd to lead to charges, or too flimsy to go to trial, or, now, too weak to survive an appeal,\u201d he wrote in his column in the Herald Sun. But the ABC defended its journalists, who include Louise Milligan and Sarah Ferguson who have both done significant investigations into the cardinal, on 7.30, Four Corners and in the documentary series Revelation. The original news report that revealed Pell was under investigation by Victoria police was written by Lucie Morris-Marr for News Corp\u2019s the Herald Sun. \u201cThe ABC has \u2013 and will continue to \u2013 report accurately and without fear or favour on stories that are in the public interest, including this one,\u201d an ABC spokesman said. \u201cWe stand by our reporters and our stories.\u201d Greg Craven, the president and vice-chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, who wrote a character reference for Pell, claimed ABC journalists and \u201ca large group of the ABC\u201d did \u201cits very best to be part of the cheer squad that made [the conviction] happen\u201d. \u201cWhat it shows is if you are hated enough and if you\u2019ve got enough of the media against you and enough of the state authorities against you, it becomes very hard to get a fair trial,\u201d Craven said after the verdict of the high court. Bolt was joined by fellow News Corp columnists Janet Albrechtesen and Miranda Devine in targeting the ABC\u2019s reporting. The Daily Telegraph blogger Tim Blair said \u201cgreat man walks free\u201d. Devine, who has been consistent in her support of Pell, said justice had been done at last. \u201cA good priest, falsely accused and railroaded through a politically motivated investigation and an unfair trial, can walk free, in Holy Week,\u201d Devine said. \u201cThe media lynch mob and the entire Victorian legal system stand condemned. The unanimous decision of the high court is a conclusive repudiation of everyone involved in the false imprisonment of Cardinal George Pell, every politician, every cop, every lawyer, every journalist, every coward who naively trusted the system and vilified as \u2018paedophile protectors\u2019 those who maintained Cardinal Pell\u2019s innocence.\u201d Albrechtsen attacked the ABC reporting of the verdict, claiming it had failed to mention it was a \u201c7-0\u201d decision, but the report did state it was unanimous. Craven also criticised the ABC\u2019s reporting, claiming it was wrong to refer to the redacted parts of the royal commission report on the day he was released. \u201cThe question I have for you,\u201d Craven said on the ABC News channel. \u201cHow much guilt does the ABC feel making sure this victim has gone through years of hell only to be hurled down when the case should never have been brought?\u201d The Herald Sun columnist and Sky News presenter Rita Panahi said the media condemned Pell\u2019s friends as \u201cpedophile supporters\u201d. Bolt said the jailing of Pell was \u201cone of the greatest miscarriages of justice in this country\u201d. \u201cThe quashing of Pell\u2019s conviction for inherently implausible crimes does not make things better. \u201cShame on everyone who participated in this witch hunt and punished those few who tried to speak for justice. \u201cShame on the politicians today who still tweet as if Pell is actually guilty. \u201cBut, more importantly, this High Court decision shames the Victoria Police who trawled for complaints against Pell and asked too few questions, the Victorian Court of Appeal which dismissed 2-1 Pell\u2019s initial appeal, and the ABC which with one voice persecuted him for years with false claims and never once had a presenter express doubt about this crusade to destroy him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
