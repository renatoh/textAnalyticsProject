I haven't slept for two days \u2013 only three days ago I was still at work in London. The train conductor mistakes my haggard expression for dissatisfaction with the train service. \"Sorry, we had a flat tyre!\" he jokes. Stepping off the train into the empty streets, it's hard to get my bearings. I'm so tired it takes me several minutes to identify a curiously irritating tapping sound, rather like a woodpecker following me around \u2212 my teeth chattering. I'd been warned about the cold down here on the coast, but it feels bizarre. Am I really in Africa? The surroundings are stranger still. Swakopmund is sandwiched between the cold breakers of the South Atlantic and the burning heat of the world's oldest desert, but rather than a wild, remote, frontier town, it feels more like a rather genteel European seaside resort. Fog creeps around the corners, rolling in from the sea. The buildings which loom from the mist are whitewashed and half-timbered, looking like mock-Tudor southern England. There are twee ornamental lawns, a pier, candy-striped lighthouse and several pretty churches. When I find a hotel, the receptionist is an elderly German lady, and the young black Ovambo porter is called Gerhardt. It's not quite Europe, not quite Africa, a peculiar other world, marooned in the desert. All of which makes it the perfect setting for the remake of The Prisoner, the cult 1960s TV series that follows Patrick McGoohan trying to escape from \"The Village\", a place that is half fantasy perfection, half sinister prison. The new version stars Ian McKellen and Jim Caviezel and has many of the weird hallmarks of the original, including the evil giant balloons that chase would-be escapees; however, the location has moved from Portmeirion, the Italianate holiday village in north Wales, to Swakopmund, a town just as surreal as anything in the show. Much of its strangeness is a product of the town's German heritage. Namibia was a German colony from 1884 to 1915, but strong links continued long after that, and while there are reminders of this throughout the country, nowhere is the German influence more readily visible than in Swakopmund. Today, many of the streets have German names (though Kaiser Wilhelm Strasse has been renamed Sam Nujoma Avenue after Namibia's first president). German bakeries on every corner serve their customers Br\u00f6tchen and pumpernickel, the town's brewery makes beer to strict German standards and you can find more varieties of wurst than probably exist in Germany. Some of the bars wouldn't look out of place in Bavaria, with wood-panelling, roaring fires and maps of the fatherland on the wall. Beside the half-timbered buildings, others are painted in bright pastels, and styles range from the \"rustic\" colonial of early structures to the full-blown elegance of neo-baroque national monuments such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church. But beyond Swakopmund's colonial architecture, twee souvenir shops and carefully tended residential gardens there's always a sense of the vast African landscape outside, eerily beautiful, harsh and unforgiving, especially to the north, on the aptly named Skeleton Coast. The filmmakers used the dunes to lend visual grandeur to Caviezel's attempts at escape, but in reality they are helping draw growing numbers of tourists who come to quadbike through the desert. When Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt moved to the town for several months for the birth of her daughter Shiloh, Pitt spent much of his time ripping round the sands on a quad. I went to Swakopmund to start a solo walk across Africa, from the Skeleton Coast to the Indian Ocean, but things didn't begin well. In fact, true to the spirit of The Prisoner, I got stuck there for more than three months, my efforts to leave repeatedly thwarted. The coastal chill had done little to prepare me for rocketing temperatures inland; after four days on foot in the Namib Desert I was back in town to buy a donkey to carry my gear and water. This plan backfired, dissolving into fiasco when I bought a desert donkey called \"Tsondab\" (in the Nama language \"Where you get stuck\"). In 10 weeks together we'd covered literally less than one mile of the journey across Africa. During this period, one Swakopmund landmark in particular came to symbolise my enforced sojourn on the coast: the \"Martin Luther\" \u2013 the unluckiest steam tractor in history, abandoned just outside town. Imported by the German authorities in 1896 to replace ox-wagon transport, it proved so utterly inefficient that it took three months to clunk its way a mere 20 miles up the coast. At Swakopmund it broke down completely, and remains there to this day, earning its nickname after someone remembered the words of Martin Luther: \"Here I stand, God help me, I cannot do otherwise.\" And yet I look back on that time on the Namibian coast with perhaps the most fondness of the entire journey across Africa \u2013 the absurdity of it all delights me. If you are going to get stuck somewhere, Swakopmund is a very nice place for it to happen. Fran Sandham is the author of Traversa: A Solo Walk Across Africa (Duckworth, \u00a310.89). The Prisoner is on ITV 1 at 9pm on Saturdays Where to stay The Swakopmund Hotel (00 264 64 410 5200; swakopmundhotel.co.za), housed in the ornate former station built in 1901, is the most upmarket address, and features prominently in the Prisoner remake. It's not cheap, though: doubles with breakfast cost from N$2,950 (\u00a3260). For a taste of traditional, German-influenced Swakopmund, try the Hansa Hotel (00 264 64 414200; hansahotel.com.na; doubles with breakfast from N$1,820/\u00a3160) or the Hotel Eberwein (00 264 64 414450; eberwein.com.na; doubles from N$960/\u00a385). At the other end of the spectrum is the Stiltz (00 264 64 400771; thestiltz.in.na; doubles from N$1,290/\u00a3114), a collection of nine thatched bungalows close to the beach at the southern end of town. What to do Whether quadbiking over the dunes, sky-diving above them or surfing down them, adrenaline sports are big here. Desert Explorers (00 264 64 406096; swakop.com/adv/) can arrange all these, and more gentle activities such as horse riding and ballooning. Scenic flights are popular, and several operators in town offer flights over the Skeleton Coast or to the dunes of Sossusvlei. The beach can be windy here, but you can easily spend a day or two strolling along the seafront and stopping off at the bars and caf\u00e9s. Where to eat Swakopmund has the best food scene in Namibia outside the capital, but restaurants get busy, so you should book. Grapevine (00 264 64 404770; Libertina Amathila Avenue) is a romantic spot with gourmet food. For something more relaxed head for the Tug (00 264 64 402356; Strand Street), an old tug boat pulled on to the seafront and converted into a restaurant. German bakeries are found on most streets, with Caf\u00e9 Anton (1 Bismarck Street) perhaps the most famous. How to get there You can take the train, bus or fly from the capital, Windhoek, but the best option is to visit as part of a self-drive tour of Namibia. Roads are often unsurfaced but you don't need a 4x4. Expert Africa (020 8232 9777; expertafrica.com) offers an 11-day itinerary, including time in Swakopmund, staying at a variety of small guesthouses and farms, from \u00a31,782 including flights, car hire and accommodation. The original: visiting Portmeirion Seeing the set of the original 1967 show is rather easier. It was filmed at Portmeirion in north Wales, a holiday village built between 1925 and 1975 and designed to resemble a resort on the Italian riviera. Guests stay in a waterside hotel, a hilltop castle, or individual rooms in the buildings that make up the village. Prices start at \u00a3170 per night for a double room including breakfast (01766 770 000; portmeirion-village.com)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
