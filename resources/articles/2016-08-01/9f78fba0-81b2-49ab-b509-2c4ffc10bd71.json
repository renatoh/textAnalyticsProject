Esposito, 24, won the final event by 16 seconds, overtaking Poland\u2019s Oktawia Nowacka with one of the four laps remaining in the combined run-and-shooting event. She had been placed seventh at the start of the last stage of the competition, which combines a 3200m cross-country run with pistol shooting, starting 45 seconds behind the leader. Esposito\u2019s time of 12:10.19 added up to 1372 points overall: not only ahead of Elodie Clouvel of France, who won silver with 1356, and Nowacka, who won bronze with 1349, but an Olympic record. It is Australia\u2019s eighth gold medal of the Rio 2016 Olympics and propelled the nation into eighth place on the overall medal table. Esposito\u2019s father Daniel, an Olympian in the sport in 1984, served as her coach. Her brother Max goes in the men\u2019s modern pentathlon tomorrow. Modern pentathlon combines fencing, 200m freestyle swimming, show jumping, and a final combined event of pistol shooting and a cross-country run. Born in Camden, New South Wales, Esposito missed out on a spot for the Beijing Games, but qualified for the London Olympics in 2012, where she finished seventh. Esposito moved to Hungary in 2014 with her brother and father specifically to work on fencing, considered her weakest discipline. She finished well within the top half of contenders in fencing this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
