Not that they stopped the spate of dropped catches by the poor shivering tourists at Lord's, nor will they at this week's second game for Chester-le-Street's notorious nor'easterlies will almost certainly be more bitterly sharp. Early May Test matches are wretchedly cruel to hot-blooded visitors. None of England's previous 447 home Tests had started earlier than last week's. However keen the winds, at least a trip to Durham's handsome cricket HQ provides opportunity to defrost the cockles and gladden the heart with a few stiff warmers in the Milburn Lounge \u2013 in blessed recollection of, and still-sorrowing tribute to, that bonny Falstaffian which the bar honours \u2013 incomparable one-off Colin, 20 years dead next February and still greviously mourned the world over by cricket folk of a certain generation. It is still hard to realise that Durham weren't even a first-class county in 1990 when Burnopfield's beloved Ollie died, just 48, of a heart attack in his favourite pub, the Britannia at Newton Aycliffe, near Darlington. Wretched poetic licence, however, allowed obituarists to grieve, with reason, that to all intents the big man's life had ended 21 years earlier when, late on the night of 23 May 1969, his Austin 1800 winged a lorry on the twisty Northamptonshire B-road at Moulton and England's batsman of grandeur and panache took a header through the windscreen and lost his left eye. It remains English cricket's JFK moment. Where were you when you heard Milburn had been blinded? Saturday week is the 40th anniversary of that awful day. Are these particularly fruitful times for connoisseurs of anniversaries? Or is any and every month equally as rich if you bother to look? Thursday's Test start, for instance, marks the 91st birthday of England's oldest living Test player and one trusts the bunting will be up in his Hampshire retirement home for Arthur McIntyre, secure and stalwart Surrey stumper. Was it something in the air around those Kennington gasometers, for next after Arthur in this oldie survivors' list is Oval confrere Sir Alec Bedser (91 on 4 July). Then comes Trent Bridge's svelte maestro Reg Simpson (89) and Glamorgan's irrepressible leftie Allan Watkins (87). Nor should cricket allow this month to pass without hooraying birthday greetings to Sonny Ramadhin, if not the most prolific then assuredly the most mystifying spin bowler of my boyhood imagination (and, you bet, reality). Trinidad's two-way tweaker was 80 on May Day. At the other end of the month, celebration toasts should be raised as well to, for my money, still the most remarkable West Indian batsman of all: 30 May is the centenary of the birth of the sovereign patriarch of the line which takes in the three W's, Sobers, Richards, Lara and Chanderpaul. Remarkable feast-founder, of course, was the Jamaican George Headley, with 60 runs every Test innings, level second (with Pollock and Sutcliffe) behind only the incredible Bradman in the all-time hall-of-fame Test averages: as well, and alone, Headley stands second only to The Don as the batsman to score his side's highest percentage of Test runs. Those last punctuation colons were in dappy sort of tribute \u2013 for true-great George was born (on 30 May 1909) at Col\u00f3n, Panama, where his father DeCourcey was helping build the Canal. Bells \u2013 Bow Bells \u2013 will be ringing for boxing's significant centenary next month. Dismiss the utterly ludicrous claims for Ricky Hatton, Jack \"Kid\" Berg (aka Judah Bergman, born Whitechapel 28 June 1909) was unquestionably the finest fighter England ever sent across the Atlantic. Before May is out, however, successive centenary peals in celebration next Monday for, still and by a street, Britain's most luminous and triumphant tennis player Fred Perry (born Stockport 18 May 1909, and with a relishable new biography by Jon Henderson to commemorate it) and, just a week later, clan-chieftain of English football's epic, enduring and uncannily self-renewing Scottish management tribe, Sir Matt Busby, born Orbiston, Lanarkshire, on 26 May 1909. In between, while we're at it, 22 May is the 150th anniversary of the birth of another Scot \u2013 author, polymath and all-round cricket nut Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) who, for MCC v London County at Crystal Palace in August 1900 had WG Grace caught behind, and who, after his death at 71, 1931's Wisden's obit noted \"could surprise with the hardest of hits and bowl slows with a puzzling flight\".
