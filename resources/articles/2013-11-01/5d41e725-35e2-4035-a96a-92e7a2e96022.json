The only forecast that really matters is for another gripping England v Australia contest, with the home assistant coach Andy Farrell warning the Wallabies his team are ready \"to shock them with our intent to play\" from the opening whistle. This may disconcert those visiting supporters who still think the natural instinct of most English players is to stick the ball up their snug-fit jumpers but times have changed. Stuart Lancaster's side are currently third in the world rankings and, if they wish to rise higher, know they can ill afford to start sedately against resourceful opponents who have their own points to prove. Hence the urgent eve-of-battle rhetoric from Farrell, who not long ago was exhorting the Lions to drag the Wallabies into the \"hurt arena\" as a memorable summer Test series neared its climax. The England management strongly suspect Australia will present more attacking threats under their new coach Ewen McKenzie and are demanding the same intensity with and without the ball which comprehensively undid the All Blacks last autumn. \"I said to the boys yesterday that we've played Australia six times since 2008 and won two of them,\" cautioned Farrell. \"In 2010 the boys played a fantastic game against Australia. Watch that match back and it was their intensity that allowed them to come out of themselves and play.\" The home forwards will certainly need to be more effective at the breakdown against the mobile Michael Hooper than they were a year ago when the Wallabies won 20-14. Nor should they make the mistake of kicking too much ball down the throats of Israel Folau and the new vice-captain, Quade Cooper, who have the counter-attacking ability to make any side pay. Instead the aim will be to send the Vunipola brothers, Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury thundering repeatedly over the advantage line and to give the visitors, led by the No8, Ben Mowen, as little defensive respite as possible. The next three weekends, whatever happens, will be perfect preparation for the knock-out phases of the 2015 World Cup, always assuming England escape from their pool. In their last major Test the English pack were out-muscled by Wales and there is a collective desire to atone for that Cardiff mugging. \"Once the dam broke around the 50-60-minute mark we got left behind,\" admitted the Northampton flanker Tom Wood. \"This week we have to make sure we are at Test match intensity the second the ball goes up in the air from the kick-off. Hitting a ruck is not a science. You put your head where it hurts and do it as hard and fast as you can. England is your club level plus 20% and more. There is an expectation here now that you don't walk in defence. You don't amble to rucks. The new guys have to realise that. Otherwise you lose.\" It could easily be that the outcome is still unclear deep into the final quarter, unless England can summon up all three of the qualities - \"It's the intent they have, it's their concentration for 80 minutes and it's their calmness under pressure\" \u2013 which Farrell feels separate the consistently great sides, such as the All Blacks and rugby league's Kangaroos, from the also-rans. Outstanding teams must also find ways to deliver when it really matters, as it does this weekend. Farrell reckons England can win all three of their autumn games \"without a shadow of a doubt\" and victory over the Wallabies, possibly by a margin of between four to six points, would reinforce his belief they are upwardly mobile. \"I sense everyone feels England are in a good place and moving in the right direction,\" suggested the former Man of Steel. Take a backward step now and a large chunk of that feelgood factor will be washed away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
