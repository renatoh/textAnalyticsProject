Family memories", "bodyText": "Christmas dinner, when you\u2019re the one cooking it, is an oddly spiritual gesture. It\u2019s not just roast meat and spuds on a plate, like any other Sunday. It may look just like it, give or take a blob of cranberry, but Christmas dinner is imbued with memories. Oh, and hopes, dreams, love and loss, too. All the good, emotionally churning stuff that pairs well with a glass of brandy. When I\u2019m shelling sprouts on Christmas Eve, to Keeping The Dream Alive by Freiheit on Radio 2, putting each stubby bullet in a pan of cold water, my mind will wander over at least 10 previous dinners. My fierce Cumberland grandmother, long gone and so very missed, blasting sprouts to mulch in an old-school pressure cooker. The year I and my ex-husband learned that pancetta, cream, pepper and a casserole pot transformed sprouts from also-ran side dish into crowd-pleasing sensation. We actually ran out of sprouts before roast potatoes that year. At our house, a packet of Colman\u2019s bread sauce must always be bought, despite it having no real fans. It will be plonked on the table last of all, stirred in a Pyrex jug as a panicked afterthought, in wonky memory of long-departed great aunts and uncles. \u201cI don\u2019t even like bread sauce,\u201d we\u2019ll mutter as each one of us dutifully takes a few spoons of the largely unlovable, beige paste. \u201cOh, remember Aunty Beat? She loved it. Wouldn\u2019t eat turkey without it. Used to drive us mad.\u201d It\u2019s perfectly easy to make a British Christmas dinner for the very first time, even if you\u2019re not a remotely skilled cook. Just shove a dead bird in the oven and serve it with winter veg such as parsnips, though try not to mention, if you\u2019re French, say (as my other half is), that panais is fit only for horse feed. Or if you feel, as he does, that even making gravy is admitting in advance that all your vegetables are going to be dry. I\u2019m not sure, though, that the big meal tastes remotely the same without a whole lot of family history. A colleague told me recently that her Sri Lankan family spent their first Christmas Eve in the UK bickering in a soon-to-close Sainsbury\u2019s about what even constituted a British Christmas dinner. They were panic-buying gravy granules and enjoying some earthy, passive-aggressive, sibling-based sniping over who\u2019d be lumbered with cooking the bloody thing anyway. My heart leapt: it was their first British Christmas, and I couldn\u2019t help but think they\u2019d absolutely nailed it. Not least because, unbeknownst to them, they were making magical yuletide memories. \u201cRemember the fight we had over brandy butter in Sainsbury\u2019s in 2018? When I stormed off to Costa and you sulked in the car?\u201d They could now gleefully remind each other of it over each and every spoon of brandy butter for ever more. Hosanna in excelsis! When I\u2019m stuffing my hand up a bird, retrieving giblets, or arranging the pigs in blankets, I enjoy every little Dent family memory, but that doesn\u2019t stop me dreaming of a more perfect, refined, stress-free dinner. In the future, in 2040, say, I aspire to have an elegant Christmas on my almost-too-enormous country estate. Think Penelope Keith in To The Manor Born, when she finally marries Richard and gets her house back, combined with a touch of 1982 Princess Margaret at Sandringham. Dinner will arrive under a variety of cloches, the table setting will be tasteful, there will be enough chairs so no one has to sit on a foldable seat with a beer holder that was last used at Glastonbury. There will also be no turkey. We\u2019ll eat nut roast stuffed with macadamia, pecan and pistachio, so I don\u2019t have another poor turkey on my conscience. In my dream, my family will accept this graciously, without quibble. No one will burp or bicker or bring up the 2040 version of Brexit. I will not peel or chop anything myself, yet I\u2019ll appear occasionally before guests in an apron, looking fragrant and unruffled. My husband, who will be an elderly, yet still smoking-hot Morten Harket from A-Ha, will entertain us over pudding with a moving acoustic version of Hunting High and Low. Post-dinner, we\u2019ll play erudite parlour games while drinking fine armagnac. It will not be like other Christmases, where the Dents lie about from 5pm, incapacitated by sherry trifle and slagging off the new Quality Street (so small! So not as good as we remember!!), while still gobbling down an entire plastic box, toffee fingers and all, and watching the high-jinks of the Emmerdale Christmas special. Or maybe I won\u2019t change a thing in the future. I love our perfectly imperfect Dent Christmas. We\u2019ve honed how this day works for decades, so why spoil a winning formula?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
