But is it really such a drag that the Doncaster manager, Sean O'Driscoll, should look a picture of misery at the end of a very creditable draw against Aston Villa? \"I'm sitting third from bottom of the Championship,\" he lamented, massaging his temples. \"What do you want me to do?\" Oh. O'Driscoll metaphorically poured a bucket of cold water on the pride the players and fans at the Keepmoat Stadium were entitled to feel. \"We could have done without the replay to be honest,\" he sighed. As it is he is worrying that their efforts against Premier League opposition will have an adverse effect on their League fixture at Sheffield United on Tuesday. \"We have to turn up there.\" Despite O'Driscoll's apparent antipathy towards the FA Cup, there was a glimmer of an old-fashioned upset four minutes from the end when Martin Woods loitered over a free kick. \"Top corner or Row Z?\" debated a couple of Rovers fans in the main stand. It turned out to be top corner, but unfortunately for Woods it clipped the angle of post and crossbar. Woods, a free transfer from Rotherham the summer before last, posed the biggest threat to an otherwise underworked Brad Friedel. In the first half he also struck the woodwork, as Doncaster endeavoured to punish a Villa side a little underwhelmed by this particular challenge. They seemed to be on auto-pilot. Even Martin O'Neill looked less agitated than usual on the touchline. O'Neill admitted fatigue might have been a factor. \"Some players are at it all the time. But we are unbeaten for a while, we've got a bit of momentum, and we've a big game coming up on Tuesday against Portsmouth.\" He respected Doncaster enough to field their strongest available line-up, barring the group of injured, suspended, and Emile Heskey, whose registration came too late to be involved. He knows his squad is on the slim side. They certainly lacked balance without the ferocious pace of Ashley Young, serving the first of his three-match ban. But still they created enough chances to have secured a place in the fifth round. Gabriel Agbonlahor's acceleration was the major worry for Doncaster and James Milner's industry worked a flurry of openings, but their opponents defended diligently. It took half an hour for Villa to force Neil Sullivan to demonstrate the benefit of his experience. The ex-Wimbledon, Tottenham and Chelsea keeper \u2013 39 next month \u2013 clawed away from Agbonlahor. Villa's clearest opportunities came midway through the second half. Steve Sidwell glanced a free header wide, before Agbonlahor sped towards goal and chipped against the crossbar. Doncaster were tidy enough, but missed a cutting edge of their own. Their cause was not helped by the fact their vertically challenged front two, compared to Villa's 6ft-plus gang at the back, was like a scene from Lilliput. With 15 minutes to go, O'Driscoll changed both his strikers for a late push. After Woods had come close, the search for a grandstand finish shifted up the other end as Villa broke and substitute Craig Gardner's angled shot was kept out by Sullivan. And so Doncaster have a payday to come on Tuesday week. Villa, who fared so much better than the whipping they endured here four years ago, remain in a position to continue the chase on three rewarding fronts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
