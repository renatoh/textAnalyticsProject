Unable to do much with the goal conceded, or pick out the correct corner in the penalty shootout. 8 Ellie Carpenter Looked solid in defence while being an avenue out wide in transition. Found a bucket of space and converted some of that to produce good service when required. 6 Alanna Kennedy A red card marred an otherwise commanding display in defence. The centre-back made key interceptions and challenges whilst also pushing forward at times to provide something different. 6 Steph Catley A difficult day at the office, but largely lived up to the challenge. Got caught napping while marking Herlovsen in the build up to Norway\u2019s goal. 6 Elise Kellond-Knight Important in defence but a game-changer in attack with a sickeningly sweet corner turned goal to bring the Matildas back into the contest. 7 Tameka Yallop Found some exciting pockets of spaces and combined well to create opportunities. Did need to show some more patience in the build up. 6 Emily van Egmond A solid game but not brilliant. She was able to produce some key passes but needed to do more to track the players Norway had in those spaces, particularly in defensive midfield positions. 6 Chloe Logarzo Did a lot of recovery work throughout the match. Pressed well and put in some challenges to win the ball, but failed to get in the areas further up the park Australia hoped to find her. 6 Hayley Raso Australia\u2019s key producer of opportunities for large spells. Was a real spark when able to pick up the ball and create something out of midfield and turn into attack. 7 Sam Kerr (captain) Handled being man-marked for the majority of the match smartly, dropping deep in moments to create space and opportunities for others. Created some opportunities in the area, but unable to find the necessary composure. 7 Caitlin Foord Was equally as important in tracking back as she was creating opportunities in attack. Some of her turns were magic in opening up play but just couldn\u2019t be clinical when it counted. 6 Subs: Emily Gielnik 6 (for Raso 74); Claire Polkinghorne 7 (for Kellond-Knight 94); Karly Roestbakken 5 (for Van Egmond 116); Amy Harrison 5 (for Carpenter 122) Norway Ingrid Hjelmseth Didn\u2019t have a busy day in terms of shots on target to deal with. However the goalkeeper kept her backline organised and stood up during the penalty shootout. The only blot on her copybook was to concede the goal from the corner. 7 Kristine Minde The full-back was able to push high up the park, however as the game wore on became increasingly more exposed on the quick transition. 5 Maria Thorisdottir Was strong in keeping the line, put in timely challenges and made interceptions while being pivotal to Norway keeping their defensive shape. 6 Moren Mjelde (Captain) The centre-back did a massive job both commanding the defence and keeping Kerr at bay. Able to nip at the heels of Kerr all match, she forced the Australian forward to drop deep for any opportunity. 8 Ingrid Moe Wold Really solid in one-on-one situations, whilst keeping the noise of Australia\u2019s attack on her flank to a minimum. 7 Gura Reiten Was really busy and a huge part in Norway winning the ball in midfield. She was also able to move forward well while linking up play between the attack and defence. 6 Ingrid Engen The midfielder used her body really well as always. She was essential in suffocating the space in front of her defence, while her quick simple passing kick started many of Norway\u2019s transitions. 6 Vilde Risa Saw a lot of the ball and did some tidy work in finding the pockets of space to pass into. The Norwegian also produced a handful of stunning strikes from a distance. 7 Karina Saevik Caused some absolute havoc down the right side in the first half and went on to produce an excellent assist for the opening goal. 7 Caroline Graham Hansen The forward was absolutely magic with the ball at her feet and runs at defence. She stamped her authority on the match early, continued to dazzle and was jaw-droppingly good throughout. 9 Isabell Herlovsen Her goal demonstrated incredible composure but, while she was patient and hardworking, she was often isolated upfront. 7 Subs: Frida Maanum 6 (for Saevik 72); Lisa-Marie Utland 7 (for Herlovsen); Synne Hansen 6 (for Wolde 102)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
