The England captain, watched by around 2,000 supporters at an event held in aid of the club's chosen charity, Help a Capital Child, fell to the turf clutching his right foot after blocking a shot in a practice game towards the end of the 90-minute session. He was treated briefly behind the goal but eventually retired down the tunnel, with the help of the first-team doctor, Dr Eva Carneiro, and Jon Fearn, appearing to be in some distress. The injury was subsequently diagnosed as a tweak of the achilles tendon and the 31-year-old underwent further treatment at the ground. Chelsea are optimistic he will be available for Thursday's daunting trip to Tottenham Hotspur but Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas's side are still to discover whether David Luiz, who has a slight knee injury and missed Saturday's draw at Wigan Athletic, will be able to feature at White Hart Lane. With Alex transfer-listed and not under consideration \u2013 the Brazilian's appearance at Stamford Bridge on Monday was limited to a private visit to the gym next to the stadium \u2013 and Paulo Ferreira only a bit-part player at the club these days, Chelsea's fully-fit options at centre-half amount to only Branislav Ivanovic, making Terry's inclusion appear critical. Ramires, too, continues to undergo treatment at the club's training ground in Cobham in the hope that he will be fit to return to the lineup against Spurs. Terry, who suffered bruising to a knee at the DW Stadium, was able to attend the squad's visit to children's wards in the nearby Chelsea and Westminster hospital after the training session but will be assessed again by medical staff at Cobham today. Villas-Boas's side could be 12 points adrift of Manchester City in the Premier League title race by the time they kick-off against third-placed Spurs, though they hope they can maintain their challenge in the months ahead. The Portuguese will step up his attempt to refresh his squad in next month's transfer window and Everton's England midfielder Jack Rodwell is one of the players under consideration. The 20-year-old has enjoyed a regular run in the first team at Goodison Park this season, prompting his elevation to Fabio Capello's full squad, and his progress has attracted the interest of Chelsea. David Moyes, Everton's manager, may be reluctant to lose him mid-season, meaning the London club could revisit the issue during what is likely to prove a busy summer in the market. Moyes would expect to raise \u00a320m if the sale is forced upon him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
