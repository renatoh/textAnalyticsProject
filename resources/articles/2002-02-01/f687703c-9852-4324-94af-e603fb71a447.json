Saint-Andr\u00e9 made his decision after a meeting yesterday with the Gloucester chairman Tom Walkinshaw. The former France captain's contract was due to end in May and he had been negotiating a new deal for the last three months. Walkinshaw said: \"Philippe has made an extremely valuable contribution to Gloucester during his three seasons in charge but during recent discussions we both came to the conclusion that it would be in his and the club's interests if we went our separate ways.\" Saint-Andr\u00e9 has been linked with Bourgoin and he is expected to be unveiled as the French club's new director of rugby on Sunday with his assistant at Kingsholm, Laurent Seigne, appointed as head coach. The rest of his coaching staff will look after Gloucester to the end of the season. With Gloucester's most expensive player Henry Paul recently criticising the coaching set-up and with reports of dressing-room discontent, the question had become whether Saint-Andr\u00e9 survived until the end of the season or whether he left before the end of it. He leaves Gloucester in better shape, in terms of results, than when he took over from Richard Hill three years ago. Gloucester are second in the Premiership and they are in the semi-finals of the Parker Pen Shield. Last season they reached the semi-finals of the Heineken Cup, having qualified for the tournament for the first time. Gloucester are currently holding contract talks with three players brought to the club by Saint-Andr\u00e9, the props Patrice Collazo and the new Italian cap Federico Pucciariello and the French international hooker Olivier Azam. The club's chief executive Ken Nottage admitted that all three had expressed concerns about their futures in the event of Saint-Andr\u00e9's departure. Walkinshaw will tomorrow meet the Gloucester captain Phil Vickery, whose contract runs out at the end of June and who from April 1 will be free to talk with other clubs. Vickery has been linked with Leicester and Bath. The new Scottish Borders district are to sign three of Newcastle's Scotland internationals, Gary Armstrong, Doddie Weir and George Graham, who all move north on June 1. Matt Dawson yesterday admitted he had given up hope of playing in England's Six Nations match against France in Paris next week. The Northampton scrum-half has not regained full fitness following an ankle injury. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
