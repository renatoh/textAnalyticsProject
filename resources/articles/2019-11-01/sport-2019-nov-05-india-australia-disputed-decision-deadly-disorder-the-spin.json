His Test career lasted nearly 18 years, since when he has been a manager, an elite umpire, an administrator and a commentator. A fine off-spinner and occasionally useful lower-order batsman, Venkat retired with a batting average of only 11.68 and the poor shot he played at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai precisely 50 years ago this Friday would have been one of many. This one just had particularly significant consequences. Having been parachuted into the team at the last minute following a popular outcry Venkat was playing in his 10th Test, the first of a five-match series against Australia, and India were hurtling to already near\u2011certain defeat. They were 114 for seven in their second innings, nursing an advantage of precisely 40 over the tourists and needing something of a miracle. At which point Alan Connolly bowled, Venkat swung his bat and the ball whistled through to Brian Taber, the Australia wicketkeeper. There was a half-hearted appeal, in response to which the umpire Sambhu Pan unexpectedly raised his finger, and it was at this point that all hell broke loose. Ajit Wadekar at the non-striker\u2019s end demanded that the umpire explain himself. Venkat walked off, but not without the occasional backward glance. Devraj Puri, commentating for local radio, which was being closely monitored by many in the ground, criticised the decision in the strongest terms. And a massive crowd, already grumpy about their team\u2019s manifest failings, boiled over. \u201cAngry spectators hurled bottles, chairs and bricks and lit fires. The Brabourne Stadium ground was littered with glass, smashed chair and stones as police chased the crowd off the field,\u201d the Guardian reported. \u201cThe scorers refused to continue after the covering over their heads went up in flames. Fire brigades were called and a riot squad formed a line between the dressing rooms and the pitch.\u201d Through it all the Australia captain Bill Lawry refused to go anywhere. Play continued as seats and stones rained down on the outfield, and the fires started in the stands started to spread and send thick, dark smoke across the field. At one point Graham McKenzie aborted his run-up after a large rock whistled just past his head. A Test that had already featured two crowd fatalities \u2013 a 50-year-old on the first day and a 35-year-old on day three, both apparently of natural causes \u2013 had taken an unexpectedly violent turn. Play ended soon afterwards, but the Australians stayed on the field for another 20 minutes while police cleared the area, clutching stumps for self-defence, before being ushered to the dressing rooms through an improvised tunnel formed of police shields. AN Ghose, president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, said such incidents had \u201cnever happened in India before\u201d (not entirely true, though they had not previously spread to Mumbai), that they \u201conly tend to blacken the image of our country and leave behind a bad taste\u201d and that true fans should give visiting players \u201ca rousing reception wherever they go and cheer them as they play\u201d. It was not a message that was widely taken to heart. Australia completed victory in that first Test, drew the second and lost the third. By the time the action moved to Kolkata for the fourth Test attention was so intense that 10,000 fans turned up at Eden Gardens for Australia\u2019s final practice session, forcing its abandonment. Ram Chatterjee, Bengal\u2019s sports minister, issued a plea for calm, asking locals to ensure that \u201cthe fair name of West Bengal is not tarnished in any way by any untoward incident\u201d, and adding that \u201ceach one of you present in the grounds or remaining outside will act as guardians of peace during the great game ahead\u201d. Chatterjee could have done with some guardians of peace after 5,000 fans besieged his office in search of tickets, forcing him to sneak out by a side door. Not that he could go home, because a further 6,000 people had gathered there. Sadly, there were no tickets remaining. The game was a sell-out, and though some tickets would be made available each morning there would be only 500 of them. Demand for them grew so great that with the match still reasonably well poised \u2013 Australia, batting second, had accumulated a 123-run first-innings advantage but with India 12 without loss in their second knock it was all to play for \u2013 25,000 people camped overnight in the hope of seeing the fourth day. Three hours before the gates were due to open that day\u2019s meagre allocation of tickets went on sale and, realising the hopelessness of their cause, many fans decided they might as well have a go at breaking in. Such was the ensuing chaos that by the time police arrived and with the aid of \u201crepeated charges and tear gas\u201d brought the situation under control, six people were dead and around 100 injured. The game still continued, and Australia romped to a 10-wicket win. The next day, as their players travelled to the airport by coach, they came under attack. \u201cBefore we had time to collect ourselves, rocks the size of half house-bricks were smashing into both sides of the bus, shattering nearly all the windows,\u201d wrote Lawry. \u201cThe driver tried to accelerate up the hill while all members of the team flung themselves to the floor, wondering whether they would be dragged out and stoned to death if the bus stalled. As we reached the top of the hill we regained our seats with as much dignity as possible. Looking back, we could see a group of about 100 Indians waving their arms angrily at us.\u201d Before the fifth Test at Chennai, which they won to secure a 3-1 series victory, there was a game against South Zone, which was abandoned 10 minutes early when Australia seemed set to secure an undeserved draw and fans started to throw their rubbish \u2013 largely apple cores, orange peel and assorted nuts, as well as the more traditional stones \u2013 at the fielders. Lawry had the misfortune to be batting as the missiles rained on to the outfield. Still, by this time he had seen quite a lot worse. \u201cCompared to what can happen in India,\u201d he wrote, by now with some authority, \u201cI would describe this as a mild and friendly gesture.\u201d \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.
