Hughes was turned on by large sections of the crowd after Marko Arnautovic, the former Stoke forward, scored West Ham\u2019s second goal 15 minutes from time. The mood was mutinous by the time Diafra Sakho added a late third but Hughes, whose team will drop into the bottom three if West Brom defeat Manchester United on Sunday, believes he can still coax more out of his players. \u201cI know this group and I know what they can produce,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a tune out of them and hopefully we\u2019ll get better. We\u2019re in this position. Maybe we\u2019ve got some clarity now. We\u2019re better than what we\u2019re doing at the moment. We need to get ourselves out of our situation. I don\u2019t want to be in a relegation battle; we need to recognise that and do something about it.\u201d Arnautovic, who Hughes said before the match had made a \u201csideways\u201d move in joining West Ham for \u00a324m during the summer, missed several chances to make the scoreline far greater. But Hughes pointed to the controversial first-half penalty \u2013 awarded by Graham Scott after Manuel Lanzini went to ground under Erik Pieters\u2019 challenge \u2013 as the game-changing moment and left no doubt about his interpretation. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly dived,\u201d Hughes said of Lanzini\u2019s tumble. \u201cHe\u2019s a clever player, he\u2019ll draw a foul or some kind of challenge, but he wasn\u2019t clipped, he\u2019s clearly dived. It\u2019s disappointing the referee hasn\u2019t seen that. Referees need to get match-defining decisions correct and he certainly didn\u2019t get that one right from our point of view.\u201d David Moyes, who has overseen a return of seven points and three clean sheets from West Ham\u2019s last three games, agreed the decision was questionable but believed Lanzini had simply run out of steam after a surge upfield. \u201cI think the defender gives the referee a decision to make,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cI would call it \u2018soft\u2019. Manuel\u2019s run 70 yards and he\u2019s probably run his race at the end of it. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any intent regarding a dive, I think he\u2019s riding the tackle more than anything. I see tiredness at the end of it but I don\u2019t see a dive.\u201d The away fans cheered Moyes and his players from the pitch; Hughes experienced the polar opposite but resisted any temptation to complain. \u201cThat\u2019s understandable, clearly,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI thought the fans were absolutely magnificent until the second goal, driving us on, and \u2013 like ourselves down on the bench \u2013 when the second goal went in it took the wind out of our sails.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
