He is also an immensely likeable country boy from Brecon who is now more infamous for the drunken prank that ruined his reputation in the middle of this year's Six Nations. At 6am on Valentine's Day, while celebrating Wales's astonishing comeback against Scotland the previous afternoon, Powell and a friend were arrested at a service station near junction 33 of the M4. The No8 had been spotted by startled motorists as he drove down the hard shoulder of the motorway in a golf buggy borrowed from the Vale of Glamorgan hotel. After a hard night of drinking in Cardiff, the lure of a service-station fry-up on a winter morning proved irresistible to an impulsive reveller. Heading out on to the motorway in a 15mph buggy, Powell used one of his massive hands to scoop up a cone and a flashing orange light. It did not take long for the first motorist to call the police. After his arrest, and having failed a breath test, Powell was fined and banned from driving for 15 months. He was also dumped by Wales \u2013 with his banishment only ending this week when Warren Gatland named him in the squad to play South Africa next month before flying to New Zealand. But, simultaneously, he has been faced by a dilemma which could soon lead him to switch codes and become a rugby league player. \"It's been really tough,\" Powell says, his jokey manner replaced by sombre introspection, \"and far harder than I ever thought. The last few months have been quite low and having an injury hasn't helped. I've been in a downward spiral I'm only just escaping. I once gave up rugby for a year when I doubted myself. But this time has been different. I'm having to ring friends to ask for a lift here, there and everywhere. It's putting other people out and I don't like that. I've got good friends around me but I really regret what I did.\" In his first interview since that weaving escapade, Powell is still remorseful. It probably doesn't help that we meet at the very hotel from where he set off for junction 33. A long line of golf buggies gleam enticingly outside. But Powell is intent on confronting his drunken error. He is quick to scorn his own stupidity, but it helps to step back. Had he ever played in a match which resembled the game that fateful weekend when Wales were losing 24-14 to Scotland with 10 minutes left \u2013 only to score 17 unanswered points to seal a remarkable win? \"Never \u2013 and I won't ever play another like it. Everybody let their hair down afterwards and we had a few too many beers \u2013 well I did. We'd been in camp a few weeks and hadn't had a drink up until that night. So we had some drinks and a bit of food at a do and then me and a few others went into town. \"I got back here around 12.30 and I didn't drink after because I'd had enough. But it was a silly thing I did. Around five in the morning I got the munchies but I didn't want to take the car because I thought I'd get done for drink-driving. I got this crazy idea and took the buggy. People laugh about it but it's a serious matter. With Emanuele Palladino [his manager] I'm looking at getting involved with the Campaign Against Drink Driving, to use this incident in a positive way.\" Did he consider the consequences before jumping into the buggy? \"No,\" he says, shaking his shaggy head in embarrassment. \"I just wanted some munchies. I got to the service station without any problems and, in fairness, the police were brilliant. They were quite sympathetic because I admitted I was an idiot.\" He shrugs when commended for, if nothing else, his honesty. \"If you're man enough to do it, then you've got to be man enough to admit it. I regret it and I've upset a lot of people \u2013 from ordinary fans to a great coach in Warren Gatland to my mum.\" The 28-year-old, who is particularly close to his mother, looks mortified. \"Mum was gutted really. After a good two years for me she wanted to get out the old wooden spoon and give me a good slap on the arse. She was supportive but she gave me a good bollocking as well. I think she's quietly forgiven me now.\" What about Gatland? Powell, again, appears shamefaced, as he remembers how the New Zealand-born coach had given him his Test debut in November 2008. Having first played for Wales A in 2000, Powell waited eight years for a coach to trust him at senior level. He responded with a blistering man-of-the-match performance against South Africa and was picked for the Lions. Gatland, who has selected him 14 times for Wales, has a right to feel let down. \"He does,\" Powell says, \"and Wales needed to make an example of me to put an end to all these silly stunts. I've done the crime and now I'm doing the time. But Gatland has been great, he has got brilliant man-management skills.\" Gatland might need all those skills if he is to convince Powell that his future lies in rugby union. The Crusaders, the Super League club based in Wrexham, have already tried to lure Powell from Cardiff and Wales. It is an open secret that their interest has strengthened and they will be difficult to resist when they attempt to persuade Powell to join his great friend Gareth Thomas, who recently moved from Cardiff to the Crusaders. \"I've been up a few times to watch Alfie [Thomas] play and he's really enjoying himself,\" Powell says. \"I would love to go and play league. I really would. It would suit my game. League is about getting the ball in hand and it's a straight-on game that matches my style. As a kid I always followed league and I also played it \u2013 around under-14 level. It's something I'd like to do. I'm sure I will do it \u2013 at some point in the next year or so.\" There is a real chance, judging from Powell's enthusiasm for league and his desire to make a fresh start, that the switch could come much sooner. But, with limited back-row options, Gatland's need for Powell in New Zealand is obvious. The coach could also use their time together to persuade Powell to have a change of heart and pledge himself to the 15-man code. \"Never say never,\" Powell says, grinning, his passion for league undimmed, \"and you know me. I never really plan my life. I'm just trying to clear my head and it helps that I've now got a couple of horses in Brecon. They're serious jump racehorses and they're trained by Alison Thorpe, who is probably the best Welsh trainer. It's taken my mind off things and I've got something else to dream about. I'd love to have a horse in the National or the Gold Cup one day. I could get heavily involved but, as always with me, you never know.\" Early on in his career, when Powell drifted from Newport to B\u00e9ziers to Leicester to Llanelli, he was an easily impressionable innocent who became the butt of many jokes. A good example suggested that, when he went to B\u00e9ziers, he took his own television set with him because he supposedly believed that it would screen his favourite Welsh programmes as soon as he switched it on in France. \"That was a brilliant story,\" he says, laughing, \"but people make up all sorts of things about you. I didn't last long in B\u00e9ziers \u2013 but I don't regret going there. Their coach called me Crazy Horse. He was a character.\" Powell, a character himself, winks when asked if Crazy Horse was a hit with the French girls. \"There were a few hotties out there who couldn't keep their hands off me. It was good fun.\" How is his French these days? \"I've got enough of a struggle speaking English,\" he says, before becoming more earnest. \"I'll always be down to earth. We're all the same in life, aren't we? And this is what annoys me about being a sportsman. The public see a sports star and they think he shouldn't be drinking. Everybody has the right to the occasional drink but when we go out we get targeted. There are a lot of arseholes out there. You have to rise above it, but it's quite hard.\" He smiles again. \"But people have mostly been all right. I go to the races and I get a bit of stick about the buggy. I deserve that.\" Powell takes a deep breath, as if relieved to have done yet more penance. Looking up at a sky which is a strange mix of streaming sunshine and darkly scudding cloud, it's enough to know he's got through another day. \"Today's been the best day since it happened. I've beasted myself in the gym for the first time and it feels like I'm moving in the right direction.\" He still looks pensive. \"Yeah, I take things to heart. I'm a bit of softie and it's been tough times. But, hopefully, I'm starting to get myself together. Hopefully I'm about to turn the corner \u2013 on my own two feet rather than in a buggy.\" The big man laughs lightly. \"I won't be getting in one of those again. I've learnt my lesson.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
