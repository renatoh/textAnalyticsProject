A Which? magazine survey of nine major attractions, including Disneyland Paris, found that in addition to tickets, you can expect to fork out for extra rides, pricey food, parking and incidentals such as lockers if you want to store items while you are there. Children were generally charged as adults from the age of 13 or 14, and refunds were seldom forthcoming when rides were not working. Among the dearest attractions are Alton Towers, in Staffordshire, which charges a peak-time entrance fee of \u00a325 a head from the age of 12, although a family ticket costs a maximum of \u00a374, and Legoland in Windsor, where entrance for a family of five costs from \u00a385 to more than \u00a3100. To the cost-conscious, the magazine offers one important tip: take your own refreshments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
