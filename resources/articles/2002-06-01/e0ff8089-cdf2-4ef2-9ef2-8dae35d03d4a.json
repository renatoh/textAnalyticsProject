But Veron also disappointed in Japan and was brought off at half-time in the game against England. Patrick Vieira (France) Position Midfielder Club Arsenal Was supposed to be one of the stars of the tournament but underperformed, along with many other French players. \"Patrick is one of my clients and he has been very honest about France's failure,\" Anderson says. \"But he is still one of the best players in the world at what he does and if he were to move to another club, he would still command a huge price.\" Luis Figo (Portugal) Position Midfielder Club Real Madrid Didn't perform in a Portugal side that again disappointed when it mattered most. \"He didn't come into the tournament in the best of health,\" Anderson points out. \"Don't expect to find him in the bargain basement.\" Francesco Totti (Italy) Position Forward Club Roma The great playmaker failed to impose himself and performed only fitfully. Roy Keane (Rep of Ireland) Position Midfielder Club Manchester United Did not even go to post after his extraordinary row with Mick McCarthy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
