As it floated away, aviation officials feared it would endanger air traffic, and two F-16s were scrambled from a national guard base in New Jersey to track it. But there was never any intention of shooting it down, said navy captain Scott Miller, a spokesman for the nation\u2019s air defense command. The blimp which cannot be steered remotely eventually deflated and settled back to Earth on its own, according to Miller. The bulbous, 240-foot helium-filled blimp finally came down in a wooded hollow near Muncy, a small town about 80 miles north of Harrisburg, as people gawked in wonder and disbelief at the big, white, slow-moving craft. No injuries were reported. First, the tail portion of the blimp detached and came to the ground \u201cwith no reports of other damage or casualties\u201d, Miller said. The remainder of the blimp also grounded itself. The balloon\u2019s tether hit power lines and caused outages near Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. As it hovered over Pennsylvania, police warned residents to contact the police if they spotted the airship. About 27,000 customers in two counties were left without power, according to electric utility PPL, and Bloomsburg University canceled classes because of the outage. Electricity was restored to most people within a few hours. The craft even knocked out power to the state police barracks at Bloomsburg before settling among the trees, where it was swiftly cordoned off while military personnel began arriving to retrieve it, state police captain David Young said. He said trees will probably have to be cut down to get it out. It was not immediately clear how the blimp \u2013 which is known as JLENS, short for Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System \u2013 became detached from its mooring station at Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The office of Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf released a statement to let the public know the state was monitoring the situation and discussing it with federal officials, state police and emergency officials and the national guard. The blimp is described by manufacturer Raytheon as a \u201ccruise-missile fighting radar blimp\u201d. The US army deployed the JLENS system earlier this year at Maryland\u2019s Aberdeen Proving Grounds to identify threats in the north-east. It consists of two blimps which fly up to 10,000 feet in the air. Raytheon said the helium-filled balloons can protect an area about the size of Texas. While the system is meant to detect suspicious activity in the air near Washington DC and New York City, the system failed to identify a Florida mailman who flew a gyrocopter onto Capitol Hill earlier this year. As of December 2014, the government had spent $2.8bn on the system and had approved another $43.3m to test the system. Lee Fang, an investigative reporter at The Intercept, noted that Raytheon on Tuesday posted a job opening for someone to watch the airship. Two JLens balloons broke from their moorings in Iraq in 2006, according to WikiLeaks\u2019 Iraq war logs. Both balloons were thought to have drifted towards Iran, but their final destination remains unclear.
