Supporters say the treaty will help create a broad consensus on how to deal with counterfeit goods: the kind of legislation usually aimed at criminals who mass-manufacture and sell pirate DVDs, or flood the market with dangerous fake products such as batteries and electrical equipment. In truth, the treaty also contains suggestions for the control of internet content that some believe could radically alter the nature of copyright law worldwide. According to information that leaked from a secret meeting in South Korea last week, officials are proposing new ways to deal with intellectual property infringement online, including a global three-strikes law that could effectively override any British laws, regardless of whether or not the controversial Mandelson plan goes through parliament. In addition, text drafted by the US and Japan suggests that officials are also looking to make a number of other fundamental changes and radically revamp some of the basic tenets of internet law. For starters, they propose partially dropping the idea of \"safe harbour\" \u2013 the concept that a service provider is not responsible for what its customers do with their service. The idea, also known as the \"mere conduit\" defence in English law, has been the legal backbone for internet providers, telephone companies and thousands of websites over the years, but a draft of Acta's internet section suggests that the burden should fall more heavily on service providers to police and patrol their systems. On top of all this, say campaigners, Acta is being thrashed out in total secrecy \u2013 leaving everyone guessing at what laws might be on the way. Professor Michael Geist, a prominent legal expert at the University of Ottowa, says this cloak-and-dagger approach is part of a wider set of problems with the treaty. \"A copyright agreement is being treated akin to nuclear secrets, with virtually no transparency but for a few leaks that have emerged,\" he told CBC. \"As a policy-making matter, it's enormously problematic \u2013 but then the provisions associated with the treaty are even more problematic.\" Acta could even establish a new global body such as the World Bank or World Trade Organisation, which could effectively override national legal structures \u2013 possibly making Lord Mandelson's proposals to cut off the internet connections of illegal file sharers moot. \"The US government appears to be pushing for three strikes \u2013 despite the fact that it has been categorically rejected by the European parliament,\" said Gwen Hinze of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, adding that the leaks \"confirmed everything that we feared\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
