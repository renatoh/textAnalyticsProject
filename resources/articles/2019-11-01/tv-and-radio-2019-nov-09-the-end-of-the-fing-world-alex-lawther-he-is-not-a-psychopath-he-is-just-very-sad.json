Lawther shakes his head. \u201cAh, I didn\u2019t put mine on today,\u201d he says, sounding as if he\u2019s committed a mortal sin, \u201cbut I\u2019ll definitely wear it to the launch\u201d. It is a far cry from their first meeting in the darkly comic Channel 4/Netflix hit, where Lawther\u2019s character, James \u2013 a luckless teen with psychopathic traits \u2013 plots to murder Barden\u2019s Alyssa. Slowly, the pair become more like Thelma and Louise, escaping retro-hued suburbia for increasingly high-stakes scrapes, from a carjacking to a run-in with a serial rapist. If this sounds heavy-going on paper, in reality it is a show that tackles difficult themes with a sardonic edginess and an often frantic pace that is in keeping with its comic-book origins. Although neither Barden or Lawther are as nihilistic as their alter egos, there are some parallels: she is infinitely charming, a little spiky and restless, mockingly describing herself as \u201ca degenerate\u201d, while he has a more reflective, English-student vibe, an Extinction Rebellion badge pinned to the lapel of his coat. Really, though, they are a riot. They erupt into fits of giggles as they recount the story of how James\u2019s house was knocked down in real life two days after the first season wrapped, with the character relocating to his car this season as a result of its demolition. \u201cIt\u2019s such a James thing,\u201d says Barden. \u201cCharlie [Covell, the show\u2019s writer] didn\u2019t actually put that in the script because even she was like, that\u2019s too much.\u201d \u201cMy house has disappeared!\u201d Lawther adds, fake-crying. Ordinarily, the leads of a successful TV show would not be banished to the basement, especially not a show that \u2013 according to Netflix\u2019s chief content officer Ted Sarandos \u2013 has been an \u201castounding\u201d success for the streaming service, and which also broke records on All 4. But there is good reason for it: at the end of the first season, James was seemingly killed in a police chase. While fans will by now know about Lawther\u2019s return \u2013 the second season dropped in one go on Monday \u2013 it was kept under wraps until the show\u2019s transmission (promo posters featured Alyssa in a wedding dress, alongside an urn that many presumed contained James\u2019s ashes). Although the idea of killing James off proved largely unpopular with fans, a lot of theories swirled online prior to the show airing. \u201cSome of them are amazing,\u201d says Lawther, wide-eyed. \u201cAlyssa being haunted by the ghost of James is an amazing idea. Another one was that it was Alyssa [who] was shot [by the police], and then season two becomes about them trying to break her out of jail.\u201d Barden has been offering further curveballs in interviews. \u201cPeople have been like: \u2018Is James dead,\u2019 and my answer is: \u2018Am I dead?!\u2019\u201d Adapted by actor Covell from Charles Forsman\u2019s graphic novel and boosted by a Netflix deal that saw the series broadcast internationally, TEOTFW is not your usual teen show. As indebted to Tarantino as it is to Twin Peaks, its first season lunges from murderers to middle-aged perverts, attempted sexual assault to the awkward chemistry between two female police detectives, all punctuated by dark gags and an obscure, fittingly morose soundtrack curated by Blur\u2019s Graham Coxon. The setting is a disorienting mix of British small-town-ness and Americana, via roadside diners and sprawling, overgrown forests. Although unconventional in many ways, it presents a classic conundrum: a tale of a will-they-won\u2019t-they couple who are as good for each other as they are bad. It is a mix that has proved hugely successful. As well as overshooting the broadcasters\u2019 expectations, The End of the F***ing World has become one of those shows as likely to be dissected by teens on the internet as by heavyweight critics. It bridges the gap between Tumblr fandom and awards shows, having been nominated for both a Bafta and an Emmy. While the pair admit that it is difficult to comprehend how big a phenomenon something is when you are actually in it, they know that hanging out in a shiny hotel bar would have given the game away. Barden has been spotted in places as obscure as a branch of Target in Ohio, while Lawther is often accosted in the street, although sometimes people get a bit confused. \u201cI get people coming up to me and saying: \u2018Ah, Asa Butterfield, I loved you in [Netflix series] Sex Education,\u2019\u201d he admits. Lawther is not your average matinee idol: he looks far younger than his 24 years, is faultlessly polite and often uses interviews to get deep into subjects such as politics and why private schools should be abolished (he attended one himself, during a childhood in Hampshire which he previously described as a \u201cmiddle-class bubble\u201d). He is known for his outsider roles, including a teenage paedophile in Black Mirror\u2019s Shut Up and Dance and a young, enigmatic Alan Turing in 2014 film The Imitation Game. Complex characters appeal to him \u2013 with James being a particularly knotty role to untangle. \u201cInitially, I thought [the show] was about a young man being violent towards a young woman, and I thought: \u2018I\u2019m not really that interested because there\u2019s enough of that around.\u2019 But I realised that James becomes something else. It\u2019s not about his violence towards Alyssa, it\u2019s about him understanding how he feels and working out that actually he\u2019s not a psychopath, he\u2019s just very, very, very sad.\u201d Barden, meanwhile, was born in North Yorkshire and landed a breakout role in Coronation Street at the age of 14, leading to parts in dramas and odd offbeat films such as Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s The Lobster. Alyssa wasn\u2019t the kind of role she was used to playing but, says the 27-year-old, reclining on an office chair with more than a bit of her character\u2019s forthrightness about her, it was a welcome challenge. \u201cAt first it was just another part that I wanted to do, then it was: \u2018Oh this is quite funny.\u2019 As I got closer to when we actually filmed it, it turned into: \u2018Nobody else [is] giving me an opportunity to do anything like this,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAt the time when we finally made it, I was continuously being told I would never be a lead in anything. I don\u2019t fit the mould: I\u2019m not trained, I have a working-class background and I didn\u2019t want to do a grooming storyline or play a maid every time. I wanted to lead an interesting TV show. So in the end [this] was a complete breath of fresh air.\u201d She and Lawther met for the first time during the casting process in LA, on a trip that was equal amounts of work and play. \u201cOur relationship started by being dry-iced in a nightclub and then suddenly feeling completely, instinctively safe with you when we couldn\u2019t see anything for two minutes,\u201d Barden explains. \u201cYou make people feel very safe on- and off-camera, and I think that\u2019s how Alyssa and James make each other feel as well.\u201d It is clearly something of an intense relationship, both on- and off-screen. What do its stars think of the idea, posited by critics and fans alike, that James and Alyssa\u2019s might not be a healthy bond? \u201cIt\u2019s an adolescent relationship where they\u2019re exploring trauma and insecurity so it\u2019s not really healthy, but it is a relationship that is present,\u201d says Barden. \u201cI think something only needs to be present to be healthy.\u201d Lawther nods in agreement. \u201cThey fuck up a lot and do the wrong thing but it\u2019s always with the intention of trying to help the other person or do the most loving thing,\u201d he says. \u201cOften they get it really wrong, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unhealthy to get it wrong.\u201d Besides, adds Barden, \u201cthey might have been even more lost without each other.\u201d Up to this point, the show has been primarily about Alyssa and James, with the odd tangent to take in: characters such as police officers Eunice and Teri and their sexual tension, or would-be rebel Frodo \u2013 a fan favourite played by Nick Cave\u2019s son Earl, who helped the pair to hold up the service station where he worked, before realising there was only room for two on their getaway mission. This time, though, their story is neatly interwoven with that of Bonnie, another outsider with a bone-dry sense of humour, who \u2013 in a trademark curveball \u2013 is the subject of the entire first episode. Bonnie is played by Naomi Ackie, a future household name who has a role in the upcoming Star Wars film The Rise of Skywalker. Rather than interfere with the double-act chemistry, Ackie proved an ideal addition to proceedings; seeing her on set with Barden \u201creally solidified what we were making\u201d, says Lawther. The pair also bonded with Tim Key \u2013 who plays another new character, unnerving motel owner Gus \u2013 even if Barden visibly cringes when recalling their first day together on set. \u201cObviously somewhere in my brain, I was like, this guy is in Alan Partridge, but it didn\u2019t connect, so I was going around shouting \u2018A-ha\u2019. When I realised, I was like: \u2018I look like such an idiot!\u2019\u201d As well as Bonnie and Gus\u2019s stories, we also get a James-free look at what Alyssa\u2019s life has been like in the time since that fateful police chase, including the reason behind what Lawther jokingly describes as \u201cthat fuck-off big dress\u201d. Did they ever imagine a world where the show might have abandoned James altogether? Barden claims she always knew they\u2019d be back together. \u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cThe show is Alyssa and James together, you know \u2013 that\u2019s what it is.\u201d Besides, she adds with a mischievous glance at Lawther, \u201cpeople would have been so annoyed with us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
