The mats, distributed to clubs and bars by the Labour Campaign for Lesbian and Gay Rights (LCLGR), say a vote for the Liberal Democrats would \"let Tory hate back in\". Sponsored by the GMB union, they tell drinkers: \"Go to bed with Charlie ... wake up with Howard.\" Some gay and lesbian activists said yesterday that Charles Kennedy's party had more gay-friendly policies than Labour, while the Tories accused Labour of negative campaigning and pointed to their work on tackling homophobic bullying. Political parties are increasingly keen to win over Britain's estimated 2.5 million gay and lesbian voters. Earlier this week all three major parties, plus the SNP and Plaid Cymru, signed a pledge to run a homophobia-free campaign at the request of the gay rights group Stonewall. \"Parties have started perceiving that their attitudes towards gay people can be a deal-breaker,\" said Ben Summerskill, the organisation's chief executive. Launching the beermat campaign, the schools minister, Stephen Twigg, said the Tories would \"revert to type and chip away at the rights of the gay community\" if they won. But Brett Lock, a spokesman for Outrage!, claimed: \"The Liberal Democrats' record on gay rights is better than Labour's. Obviously there's been massive progress since Labour took over, but there is also a litany of missed opportunities and equivocation.\" Lord Rennard, the Liberal Democrats' election chief, said Labour was \"running scared\" because the two parties were neck-and-neck among gay and lesbian voters. He added: \"The Liberal Democrats have won respect among the GLBT [gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender] community for our principled stand on issues such as equal age of consent and civil partnerships.\" The Tory deputy chairman, Charles Hendry, said: \"More members of the shadow cabinet than government ministers voted for civil partnerships.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
