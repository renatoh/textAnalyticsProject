For some reason the BBC has not marked this event with a special one-off broadcast so I will just have to tell you - briefly - what I have been up to. As well as running a small business and working for Michael Howard, I have undertaken a relentless round of campaigns, canvassing and coffee mornings. I have tried to bring down Faringdon's Berlin wall, save our community hospitals and stop a local swimming pool being filled in. I have opposed reservoirs, sewage plants and inappropriate housing developments. And I have flown the flag for Didcot when it was nominated as one of Britain's crap towns, as well as becoming a school governor and the patron of a church. I have enjoyed every second of it. If I become Wantage's next MP, one of my first duties will be to attend the opening of parliament and the Queen's speech of a new government. I hope and expect that the Queen will be setting out the programme of a new and much needed Conservative government, but for now we have to put up with Tony Blair's eighth Queen's speech. If you believe in omens, or at least signs of the times, you will be pleased to hear that Hansard provided a useful one last week: on Thursday it inadvertently printed a copy of last year's Queen's speech. Nobody noticed. Partly this is because the language of the Queen's speech is uniformly bland (\"My government will walk on water...\"), though last year's Queen's speech was actually memorable for one extraordinarily Orwellian passage in which the government said it intended to abolish up-front tuition fees without once mentioning that it was introducing top-up fees. The other reason Labour's Queen's speech is eminently forgettable is that it promises more of the same. And so it was with this year's: more on antisocial behaviour, despite innumerable acts and promises; more on the health service after seven and a half years of failed policies; more micro-management of schools while violence in the classroom gets worse. The Queen's speech did include one momentous measure that will profoundly change our society. That is the plan to introduce, for the first time since the second world war, ID cards. I happen to be strongly opposed to ID cards - which is a tough call for a Tory. A lot of my activists and Conservative friends in the constituency support the idea, and I have had some pretty robust conversations as a result. I just don't think ID cards will work. The government's record on introducing major projects of this kind - like its predecessors', if I am honest - is not good. We are likely to spend billions of pounds on a system that is unlikely to work as effectively as its proponents claim. IT is likely to make us less vigilant and be circumvented by enterprising criminals within weeks. But more importantly, I regard ID cards as a further infringement of our liberty. In the name of the war on terror we have already seen the suspension of habeas corpus and the locking up of detainees without trial nodded through in 24 hours. The government wants to abolish jury trial for many criminal cases and would like to imprison people with mental problems on the basis that they are likely to commit a crime. Now its ID card will help it corral us even more. ID cards are simply not, well, British: they are a hallmark of a centralised, continental state with porous borders and autocratic government. The courts got rid of them in this country in 1950 when a concerned citizen took the government to court. For them to have even the most minimal effect, we would have to carry them by law. Otherwise, what is the point? And I wonder, given the public outrage already felt about speed cameras, how people would feel when they were fined for not carrying a state document. ID cards seem to me to be a sticky-tape solution: we already have enough information that identifies us - driving licences, national insurance cards, credit cards and passports. The ID card would be an expensive addition, but it would not make us more secure. What might help would be a minister for homeland security dedicated to combating terrorism, higher and more effective spending on defence and intelligence, and more police on our streets combating crime. And funnily enough, those are exactly the things the Conservatives are proposing to do. Roll on next year's Queen's speech. \u00b7 Ed Vaizey is the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Wantage"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
