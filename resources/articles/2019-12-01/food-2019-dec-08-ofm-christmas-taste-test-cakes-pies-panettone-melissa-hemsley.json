Moist and buttery, with that yellow-y inside. Feels homemade, or from a deli. Lots of amazing fruit. Really enjoyable. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Vallebona Panettone, 500g, \u00a317.50, vallebona.co.uk Pretty. Soft and lovely. It feels a bit more brioche-y than the others. It\u2019s squishy, soft and malleable; very tear-and-share. I don\u2019t like the peel. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco Classic Fruited Panettone, 750g, \u00a33.30, tesco.com Good amount of fruit. It\u2019s not as moist as some. Has a kind of sharp smell, and there\u2019s something lacking. \u2605\u2605 Waitrose No.1 Nocciolato Panettone, 750g, \u00a315, waitrose.com I like the sugary crust and there\u2019s nice fruit, but it isn\u2019t moist enough. It would make a lovely bread and butter pudding. \u2605 Non-traditonal panettones Asda Extra Special Rum &amp; Raisin Panettone, 500g, \u00a35.50, asda.com Nice and boozy, with good fruit. If anything, it\u2019s almost too moist, but I like that. I\u2019d happily eat this with a glass of wine. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Selfridges Selection Italian Salted Caramel Panettone, 1kg, \u00a325.99, selfridges.com The smell is really nice, very bready. Where\u2019s all the fruit? I\u2019m not really getting caramel flavour, but it\u2019s tasty and I love the texture. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Heston from Waitrose Black Forest Panettone, 750g, \u00a314, waitrose.com It\u2019s so pretty with cherries on top, and they\u2019re delicious, so succulent. The chocolate on top is good. The inside lets it down, it\u2019s just like fluff. \u2605\u2605 Marks &amp; Spencer The Collection Chocolate, Cranberry &amp; Orange Panettone, 750g, \u00a315, marksandspencer.com Beautiful top, the bread is a bit disappointing. More cranberry please! \u2605\u2605 Mince pies Whole Foods Market Made In Store Mince Pies, 6 for \u00a37.75, wholefoods.co.uk I like the rustic look. Juicy mincemeat and a lovely ratio of filling to pastry. I will buy these. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Morrisons The Best All Butter Mince Pies, 6 for \u00a32, morrisons.com They\u2019re very beautiful; I love the golden rim and gorgeous star. It feels nice and heavy, but the mince is a bit sweet. \u2605\u2605 Aldi Specially Selected Mince Pies, 6 for \u00a31.25, aldi.co.uk Looks pretty. There\u2019s a big wall of pastry. Super sweet, with an overpowering flavour that doesn\u2019t feel traditional. \u2605 Tesco Finest All Butter Deep Filled Mince Pies with Courvoisier VS Cognac, 6 for \u00a32, tesco.com The pastry crumbles very easily and there is something so candyish about the mincemeat, I can\u2019t enjoy it. \u2605 Vegan mince pies Co-op Vegan Mince Pie, 1 for 90p, coop.co.uk This is huge. It tastes like a jam tart; I actually really like it. The pastry isn\u2019t bad, it just feels very crumbly. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Konditor &amp; Cook Vegan Mince Pies, 6 for \u00a310, konditor.co.uk Looks like an Eccles cake. Very sugary pastry top; too sweet for me. The fruit filling is good though. If the top was less sugary \u2026 \u2605\u2605\u2605 Marks &amp; Spencer Vegan Lattice Mince Pies, 6 for \u00a31.25, marksandspencer.com Oh no \u2026 the pastry is too thick, there\u2019s too much of it and it\u2019s dry, so it\u2019s making my mouth dry. Not enough insides. \u2605 Oggs Luxury Handmade Mince Pies, 4 for \u00a32.50, sainsburys.co.uk I don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s horrible inside. That\u2019s a shame. The mincemeat is not nice: very sweet, very overpowering. It looks nice... \u2605 Christmas cakes Marks &amp; Spencer The Collection 6-Month Matured Rich Fruit Cake, 1.54kg, \u00a320, marksandspencer.com Good ratio of cake to icing. Full flavoured. I can imagine spinning it around on my lazy susan. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference Iced Holly Wreath Cake Infused with Brandy, 900g, \u00a310, sainsburys.co.uk Moist; lots of fruit and icing. It\u2019s very dense and rich; would be lovely with a cup of Earl Grey. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Iceland Luxury Christmas Cake, 1kg, \u00a38, iceland.co.uk The icing comes off, the structure is letting it down. It\u2019s heavily spiced, bit much for me \u2013 overpowering. Not my favourite decoration. \u2605\u2605 Co-op Shimmering Iced Christmas Cake, 907g, \u00a37, coop.co.uk Crumbly; there\u2019s not enough fruit, maybe that\u2019s why. Feels more like a Jamaican ginger cake. \u2605 Meringue roulades Waitrose Black Forest Arctic Roulade, 596g, \u00a38, waitrose.com Eye-catching. I like the chocolate shards. It\u2019s crazy sweet, and not cherry-fruity. \u2605 Aldi Specially Selected Winterberry Roulade, 420g, \u00a33.49, aldi.co.uk Reminds me of the sweetest cake I ate as a child. The tart berry stuff is the nicest thing about it - but there\u2019s not enough. \u2605 Waldrons Chocolate &amp; Mascarpone Roulade, 900g, \u00a312, ocado.com Sweet but not chocolatey enough. Too moussey, no bite; messy. \u2605 Asda Extra Special Gin &amp; Gingerbread Roulade, 430g, \u00a34, asda.com Tastes really cardamom-y. I don\u2019t like it. Super sweet and strong tasting. I don\u2019t think you could eat much of it. That\u2019s intense\u2026 \u2605"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
