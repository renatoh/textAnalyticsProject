The Bears will pay the 33-year-old\u2019s $11m salary, with the Panthers contributing an additional $823,000, according to ESPN. The Bears will also receive a conditional pick in next year\u2019s draft. Allen is still to pass a medical with his new team. The Panthers are in need of reinforcements in their pass rush, with Greg Hardy joining the Dallas Cowboys earlier this year and Charles Johnson absent with a hamstring injury. Allen is also likely to benefit from the move. He was shifted from defensive end to outside linebacker with the Bears, and has looked less comfortable in his new position. As a defensive end he had made five Pro Bowls and made more than 10 sacks every season with the Minnesota Vikings, including 22 in the 2011 season \u2013 just one short of the NFL record."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
