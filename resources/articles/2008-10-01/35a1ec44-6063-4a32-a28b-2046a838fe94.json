Preston Morrow was walking along a Sierras trail near the Yosemite national park in east California when he came upon a pilot's licence and an ID card in Fosset's name, and $1,000 in cash. A sweatshirt was also found. A search of the mountainous country was begun yesterday. There is so far no sign of the single-engine aircraft in which Fossett, 63, took off from a Nevada ranch in September 2007. A huge search at the time presumed it had come down in a different region and, in the absence of any clue to the fate of the adventurer, an accomplished pilot, he was declared dead in February. His widow, Peggy, said last night: \"I am hopeful this search will locate the crash site and my husband's remains.\" The trail is near the town of Mammoth Lakes. Stuart Brown, a town spokesman, said: \"It's pretty steep, treacherous and rugged up there and the winds are a real issue. We'll see what we can do.\" Fossett held several flying and sailing records and was the first person to fly a balloon solo round the world in 2002."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
