He put his feet up, tried not to get too impatient and watched his reputation blossom with every England batting collapse. \"You don't want to be missing Test cricket,\" he said. But while England's batsmen floundered against the swinging ball, he had two months to refresh himself before returning with a flourish at the end of the season, contributing to Warwickshire's great escape from relegation, producing a strikingly assertive match\u2011winning hundred against Somerset in the CB40 final last month and winning a belated call-up to England's one-day squad against Pakistan. With England flying to Australia in little more than a week's time, Bell's status has never been higher. He does not feel like England's reserve Ashes batsman, his limitations illustrated by an average of only 25.68 in 16 Tests against Australia; he feels like a batsman approaching the peak of his powers, a batsman certain to play. Can England really now release Bell upon the Australians with a cry of \"go get 'em, tiger?\" In 2005 in England, he was a little boy lost, and on his first Australia tour he was famously sledged as the \"Shermanator\" by Shane Warne and he never quite delivered as England were whitewashed 5\u20110. At 28, this could be his time. \"I feel in the last 18 months my Test cricket has been as good as it has ever been. I've played the innings people wanted me to play under pressure. I feel I've developed into a mature player, a senior player and played the innings people want.\" It was an Ashes innings that he credits with his breakthrough: 72 in the first innings of last summer's Ashes decider at The Oval. He continued his advance with 140 in Durban, a fighting, match-saving 78 in Cape Town and finally two centuries against Bangladesh, which might not sound overly taxing but which were both made when no other England batsman made a hundred in the same innings, finally answering the criticism that he only ever scored one in somebody else's shadow. \"I don't think people ever thought ability and talent and shots was ever an issue for me. It was about doing it at the right times. I took a lot of confidence from The Oval Test match \u2013 it was probably the first time I've ever done it in an Ashes Test.\" Bell, speaking at Loughborough on behalf of the Jaguar academy of sport, a bursary for young cricketers, concedes that he was not ready for Test cricket when he first faced Australia five years ago. \"I was well short of being a Test cricketer. I'd played well in county cricket but to play against the [Glenn] McGraths and Warnes, well, the whole of that side, was a bit of an eye-opener to the standards of the world's best cricketers. \"That team I played against \u2013 in England and Australia \u2013 was arguably not far off one of the best teams of all time. In 20 or 30 years I can look at that and know it was a privilege. But it's a different team we're playing against this time. I'm a hell of a better player than I was then. I'm a tough cricketer and I've learned some tough lessons along the way.\" Bell, at his best, can offer stability for years to come. He is hard working, a natural team man and, as such, recognises the value of England's bonding trip. A batsman barely recovered from a broken foot might have observed a programme of hiking and abseiling with trepidation. Safely back home, he is quick to praise its worth. \"There are going to be some tough times in Australia. If the results don't start, we've got to plough on through. It takes effort to give time to your team\u2011mates. You can't just turn it on like a switch. \"When you're doing tough things together as a team, you start to understand people a little bit more, not just through cricket things. We were a bit out of our comfort zone in Germany and that was a great place for the group to be.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
