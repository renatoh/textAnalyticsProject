Since their defeat of Malta in October 2001, the Irish hadn't won in 15 attempts, but that embarrassing statistic was finally put to bed thanks to David Healy. The Preston North End striker is making a habit of putting an end to unwanted records, having recently claimed the goal which broke his country's 1299-minute scoring drought. Healy's 10th goal at international level puts him within three of the Northern Ireland record held by Colin Clarke and decided a scrappy game, as manager Lawrie Sanchez emerged victorious in only his second match in charge. Sanchez was clearly delighted at achieving victory over a nation 58 places above Northern Ireland's lowly world ranking of 124. \"It's nice to win a football match again because it has been a long time,\" he said. \"It's nice to score again - it was a great goal to win a game with and I think we deserved it. It's my first win in charge and hopefully the first of many. I'm sure everybody back home will have enjoyed it im mensely. There are opportunities for people to come in and give me something to think about and there were players out there today who proved they should be involved again.\" Sanchez saw his plans torn apart in the build-up when his experimental squad was further depleted by a spate of withdrawals that left him with a hugely inexperienced crop of players. The line-up contained just four of the players who started Sanchez's first game in charge against Norway, but they responded admirably, unexpectedly taking the game to their hosts right from the off. Healy, looking sharp and clearly benefiting from his extended run in Preston's starting line-up, set the tone with an excellent low drive from outside the area that flashed past the Estonian goal. It suggested this would be the day the Irish finally rediscovered the art of winning, before their World Cup qualifying group containing England and Wales begins in the autumn. With Andy Smith, the Glentoran forward, matching Healy's pace and vigour up front and Steve Jones and Jeff Whitley advancing from midfield at every opportunity, the Estonians struggled to get out of their own half in the first 45 minutes. Twice Whitley pounced on loose balls around the edge of the box to fire in long-range shots that tested Martin Kaalma. The home goalkeeper looked shaky and a half-hearted parry from Whitley's second shot fell into the path of Tony Capaldi, who was unlucky not to mark his international debut with a goal from his well-struck follow-up. Goalkeeper Maik Taylor, captaining the side for the first time in the absence of the injured Newcastle defender Aaron Hughes, was little more than a bystander, although he had to react smartly after almost being caught out by Enar Jaager's shot in the 37th minute. With the interval looming, Healy intervened. Jones collected the ball on the right and made another surge forward before picking him out on the left-hand side of the area. Healy took the ball in his stride, shifted inside and sent a fierce, curling shot into the top left-hand corner. Despite Estonia finally applying some pressure in the second half, they made little of a series of set-pieces. And though the visitors' attacks were less frequent, they again had the quality, Whitley spurning two good chances to add to their lead. Estonia (4-4-2): Kaalma; Jaager, Stepanov, Piiroja (Rahn, 80), Klavan; Reim, Smirnov (Reinumae, 83), Kristal, Zelinski (Teever, 6); Rooba (Lindpere, 72), Kink (Terehhov, 70) Northern Ireland (4-4-2): Taylor (Birmingham); Baird (Southampton), Capaldi (Plymouth), Craigan (Motherwell), Williams (Wimbledon); Sonner (Nottingham Forest) ( Duff , Cheltenham, 79), Mulryne (Norwich City) ( McCann , Cheltenham, 69), Whitley (Sunderland); Jones (Crewe), Healy (Preston), Smith (Glentoran).
