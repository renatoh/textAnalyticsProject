Stoke\u2019s 2-0 win was a particular concern because of its manner, as City\u2019s defending was again unconvincing and Mark Hughes\u2019s team might easily have doubled the margin of victory. This followed similarly dispiriting 4-1 defeats to Liverpool and Tottenham this season, yet City have also beaten Chelsea 3-0, Newcastle United 6-1, Bournemouth 5-1 and, in the Champions League, Sevilla 3-1. Pellegrini, though, did not accept that City had a split personality, saying: \u201cI hope not. Because I am disappointed about [those] three games during this season. Just three games. We have played 25 games this season so I don\u2019t like to lose in that way but I hope that was the last one \u2013 not the last defeat because you can lose against everyone \u2013 but in that sense, yes.\u201d The Chilean does wish to eradicate the slipshod displays. \u201cYes we need to because we\u2019re too ugly [in those]. You can lose against every team here in England but you can\u2019t lose so ugly. It\u2019s an important thing that we analyse why but I know exactly what to expect from this team every game.\u201d Pellegrini\u2019s preferred style of victory, unsurprisingly, is to score as many goals as possible while keeping a clean sheet. Asked if this was because he likes his side to be an entertaining proposition, he said: \u201cI like to play attacking football, I like to score a lot of goals, but I prefer to win 4-0 rather than 4-2. That\u2019s why I think that if we are conceding goals it\u2019s not because we are playing attacking football, because if you see the goals you must analyse every goal we conceded. Maybe the two goals of Borussia, we had seven or eight players near our box [so we had enough numbers]. \u201cI like to play attractive football, I like that the fans enjoy the game, I think that is the best way to win titles.\u201d Sergio Ag\u00fcero faces a battle to be fit for City\u2019s trip to Arsenal on 21 December. The striker is still suffering from the effects of a kick on a heel he suffered in the victory over Southampton on 28 November and is definitely out of Swansea City\u2019s visit to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. \u201cI hope he will start working with the squad Tuesday or Wednesday,\u201d said Pellegrini. \u201cWe play on Monday against Arsenal so we hope he will be fit for that game. Ag\u00fcero is improving but he will not be ready for this weekend.\u201d Vincent Kompany\u2019s calf injury means he misses Swansea\u2019s visit and is also a doubt for Arsenal. \u201cWe\u2019ll see because it\u2019s not the same injury [as Ag\u00fcero] \u2013 one is a muscle injury, the other is just a pain in his heel,\u201d said the manager. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for a player just to work three days and to be ready to play. It\u2019s one thing for a player to be fit after his injury and the other one is to be ready to play. That\u2019s a very important difference that we will see during the week but I think we have just a few days.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
