Srdjan Todorovic plays Milos, a retired porn star who needs cash and is offered the lead in an experimental new adult movie. Too late, Milos discovers that this will involve his young family being prisoners in a horrific snuff-porn inferno, involving the rape and butchery of men, women and children. Some observers may feel that, for all its ugliness, this might actually be a more honest film about the former Yugoslavia than, say, the manically exuberant movies of Emir Kusturica, whose frantic high spirits often look like displaced violence. But the acting and direction are awful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
