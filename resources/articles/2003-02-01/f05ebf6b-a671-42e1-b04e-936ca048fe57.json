The building is the headquarters of Clifford Chance, the City law firm which is moving into a new building at Canary Wharf later this summer. Little Britain had a price tag of \u00a3203 million last summer when it was first put on the market by the Prudential and Japanese company Nippon Life. It was under offer to CIT, an offshore vehicle, which failed to get funding last December. It is thought that Canary, which has now placed the 470,000sq ft building under offer, will be paying less than \u00a3200m. Sources close to the deal say the controversial land company, chaired by Canadian Paul Reichmann, is still trying to renegotiate the price down as prospects for real estate in the City deteriorate. There are growing concerns that the Square Mile office market is heading into a slump. Rents are expected to almost halve from peaks of \u00a365 per sq ft 18 months ago as banks ruthlessly cut expansion plans and attempt to sub let space. Office vacancy rates in the City are well over 10 per cent - a rate similar to those seen in the early Nineties. But property experts do not expect major corporate bankruptcies this time. Not only are interest rates considerably lower than a decade ago, making debt more serviceable, but City developers such as Land Securities and Legal &amp; General have balance sheets strong enough to cope with a prolonged downturn. Last year Canary Wharf was scouring London and the South East for opportunities to expand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
