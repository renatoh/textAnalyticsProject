Suddenly, she\u2019d transformed into some kind of experimental girl-group revivalist. Two more albums in the same vein later and she\u2019s signed to 4AD for a fifth album that offers, well, more of the same. It opens brilliantly with Sororal Feelings, in which a cavernous drum loop and a simple, almost deep-soul two-chord pattern backs Remy singing about marrying a man who had previously slept with her three sisters: \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going to hang myself / Hang myself from the family tree.\u201d But it\u2019s such a bold and confrontational statement that Remy can\u2019t match it. There are high points \u2013 the twisted 80s pop of Navy &amp; Cream, the spooked electronica of New Age Thriller \u2013 but you\u2019re left wishing for something as startling as the opener. Recommended, but with caveats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
