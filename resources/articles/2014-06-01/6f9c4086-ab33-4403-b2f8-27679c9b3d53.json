But still it comes as a shock every year to be reminded of the beast that is Origin; a beast that bestrides club (and, you could argue, international) rugby league and lays waste to it, yet does so with such primal majesty that we can\u2019t look away, much less save ourselves. The build-up to Origin I was intrusive enough but since the game its shockwaves have spread far and wide. As Queensland seethed over the controversial downgrading of Josh Reynolds\u2019s dangerous throw charge (prompting journalistic incontinence from the Courier Mail), Melbourne were paying the price of having to face North Queensland without Cooper Cronk and Billy Slater (and Cronk won\u2019t be back any time soon). Parramatta, meantime, played Penrith without Jarryd Hayne, and it showed, Newcastle lost Beau Scott for their defeat to New Zealand, Manly\u2019s Daly Cherry-Evans and Anthony Watmough had to watch as their team wilted against Brisbane, while St George Illawarra and Canterbury learned that their respective Morrises, Brett and Josh, will be convalescing for some time. You could argue that the clubs benefit from having rep-standard players in their ranks but as this clearly shows they certainly pay a hefty price. Bennett facing his biggest challenge Manly coach Geoff Toovey will be scratching his head over his team\u2019s uncharacteristic sloppiness and sluggishness in losing to an impressive Brisbane outfit on Sunday afternoon. Manly don\u2019t tend to get scores put on them, and it must be some time since they conceded seven tries. But Toovey and Manly\u2019s problems are but a passing zephyr compared to the supercell assailing Wayne Bennett and his Newcastle side. Facing the Warriors in Auckland in what played out like a testimonial for Warriors skipper Simon Mannering (who scored a brace on the occasion of his 200th game for the team, his 100th as captain), the Warriors finished strongly to register a 38-18 win. The Knights were far from awful and indeed completed a commendable 84% of their sets (26 from 31) but they made considerably less headway with the ball than the locals (1,025 metres run to 1,416m) and missed a telling 29 tackles. Bennett\u2019s teams tend to build their foundation on defence; such stats suggest those foundations are shaky. It\u2019s been a rough year in Newcastle what with the spinal injury to Alex McKinnon and the unrest caused by former owner Nathan Tinkler, who\u2019s now ridden his swaybacked mule out of town, his middle finger raised defiantly, but Bennett is going to need all his experience and nous to pull the team together, much less have them making a tilt at the semis. Bennett has been there, done that in his 38 years as a coach but it\u2019s hard to recall him ever being in such a position. Looks like you\u2019re never too old for new experiences. A vision of the Storm\u2019s future Without intending to diminish the acumen of Craig Bellamy, the holy moly trinity of Cameron Smith, Slater and Cronk could have helped make even Paul Langmack look like a coaching genius, and Bellamy has had all three in his side since 2004. Bellamy and the Storm are used to negotiating a few games through the Origin period without the trio (although in previous years they\u2019ve at least had Gareth Widdop holding the fort) but with the long-term injury to Cronk, and a shoulder strain set to keep Slater on ice for a few weeks, it\u2019s going to take everything Bellamy has to keep his team from losing too much ground on the competition front-runners. But it could have been worse. Smith was expected to miss Saturday night\u2019s game away to North Queensland with an ankle injury picked up in Origin, and the kind of soreness you can only get from running into Paul Gallen over and over again, but the Queensland captain showed again that he has the recuperative powers of a salamander. Nevertheless, even Smith\u2019s presence in the Storm line-up \u2014where he tried to be at dummy half and first receiver all at the same time, a stretch, even for him\u2014 didn\u2019t help Melbourne against the Cowboys who had to work hard but eventually wore their opponents down thanks in no small part to Johnathan Thurston, bouncing back from a relatively quiet performance in Origin. They\u2019ve a few years in them yet but the time is coming when the Storm will no longer have the big three to steer them around and pull rabbits out of the hat. On Saturday night we had a brief vision of what that future may hold. Life goes on Much was made of Mitchell Pearce and James Maloney being dropped from the NSW Blues ahead of Origin I but spare a thought for how strange and unsettling it must be for your ability, your at-work performance, and your sacking, to be so publically dissected, perhaps even celebrated. It may well be the lot of the well-paid footballer, but it would take some measure of equanimity to deal with it well \u2013 as Pearce and Maloney seem to be doing. Since being dropped they\u2019ve kept a low profile off the pitch while on it they\u2019ve just got back on the horse, and both have put in fine performances the past two rounds. Trent Robinson praised Pearce in particular after the Roosters\u2019 comfortable 26-12 win over the Canberra Raiders on Saturday night, but Maloney \u2013 arguably the unluckier of the two to be dropped from the Blues considering he\u2019d played just three games and hardly performed badly \u2013 was the standout, laying on three tries for Daniel Tupou and scoring one himself. As a young girl once sang, and as Pearce and Maloney are discovering, the sun always comes out tomorrow. It\u2019s a better quality chocolate used in Penrith these days After three years in the wilderness \u2013 years in which their neighbours (and former overlords) Parramatta were even worse off, buried, as they were, head down in a dung hill \u2013 Penrith are certainly giving the impression they\u2019re heading in the right direction. On Friday night, in front of a bumper crowd of 19,141 that reflected the confluence of their rivalry and respective ladder positions, the Panthers crushed the Eels 38-12. Beating Parramatta is sweet enough (\u201cIf you come through Penrith juniors, you\u2019re brought up to hate Parramatta,\u201d former Panther Michael Jennings once said), but coach Ivan Cleary will gain more satisfaction from the systematic and controlled manner of the win. Parramatta, it has to be said, were down on recent performances (and Hayne\u2019s loss was felt), but Penrith looked like a team in synch. The old (well, the young old, like James Segeyaro, and the increasingly impressive Matt Moylan) have been merged with the new (like Peter Wallace, Jamie Soward, Brent Kite and Tyrone Peachy) but even when you look hard you can\u2019t see the joint. It\u2019s why the other joint, Panthers Stadium, is positively jumping. BONUS THING WE LEARNED! Origin at the MCG The MCG is set to host an Origin game for the first time since 1997 next year. The Australian Rugby League commission had previously flagged a lone match at a neutral venue in 2015, with Sydney not scheduled to host two games of an Origin series until the year after. Melbourne's famous ground has been the venue for three previous Origin fixtures, the first of which attracted a then-record rugby league crowd of 87,161 on 8 June in 1994. Game two of the 1995 series and the third match in 1997 were also played at the MCG. Melbourne last hosted a State of Origin game at a sold-out Etihad Stadium in 2012."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
