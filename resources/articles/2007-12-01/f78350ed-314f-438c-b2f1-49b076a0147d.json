The BHA now intends to take one more formal look at the site early in the new year when - \"depending on progress\" - February 24 2008 will be confirmed for the inaugural meeting at Britain's first new racecourse since 1920. Given the saga that has gone before, it is unlikely that many locals will be queueing up to buy an annual badge for Great Leighs before they have seen horses racing down the home straight with their own eyes. Yesterday's inspection, meanwhile, also coincided with the formal handing back of six more fixtures to the BHA, which were scheduled to take place between January 28 and February 21. Nonetheless, as many punters find racing diaries from their bookmakers dropping through the letterbox, there is growing optimism that the long series of fixtures scheduled for Great Leighs next year will not prove nearly so redundant as it did in 2007. \"Our inspectorate made a formal visit today,\" Will Lambe, of the BHA, said yesterday, \"and the amount of progress that has been made on the site is very encouraging. The weighing-room complex in particular is now looking very impressive. \"Another informal visit has now been scheduled for December 20, with the next formal visit following on January 4. If the current rate of progress at the site can be maintained, it is feasible that on that date, we will be able to agree a formal start date of February 24, which is a Sunday afternoon.\" It can also be seen as positive that the February 24 fixture might also have been taken back by the BHA yesterday, but that would have given the track a probable start date of February 28, which is scheduled to be run under floodlights. \"The fixtures that have been handed back will be subject to the standard re-auctioning process,\" Lambe said. \"If and when February is confirmed, there will be a period during which the track will be put through all the necessary testing. This is an entirely new racecourse, so it was not felt that it would be suitable to stage a first meeting under floodlights too. Kempton put down a new all-weather track, but the personnel there already had plenty of experience of running a meeting. With a new site and all the logistics involved, it was felt that an afternoon fixture would be preferable.\" The British Horseracing Board - as it was then - first gave its approval for the new track at Great Leighs in June 2003, so the first meeting there will complete a near five-year process. Sheikh Mohammed's vast and spectacular new development at Meydan in Dubai, by contrast, is expected to be built in little more than two. Rather like the new Wembley stadium, though, which was also dogged by many delays, the operators of Great Leighs will hope that all the waiting will be forgotten when its regular programme finally begins. It will be the first track in Britain designed specifically for all-weather racing, as opposed to previous courses that have been put in around existing turf facilities. It may not be the future of British racing, but Great Leighs intends to be a definite step forward. That step may now be little more than two months away. Ron Cox's tip of the day Royal Embrace 6.20 Kempton Lightly raced this year with only four outings, Royal Embrace is fancied to follow up his course and distance victory five weeks ago. This four-year-old showed a nice turn of foot that day to seal matters and was unlucky not to score again over the extended mile at Wolverhampton last time when blocked in his run. That effort in third was a career best run and a repeat here will suffice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
