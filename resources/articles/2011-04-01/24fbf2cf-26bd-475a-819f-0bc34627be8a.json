Flying close by, shining with an orange hue, should be the external fuel tank, separated from the shuttle and destined to re-enter and burn up in the atmosphere further around the orbit. Endeavour's flight to the International Space Station is expected to be the penultimate shuttle flight. The ISS is making spectacularly bright transits in our evening sky. Asterisks in our BST predictions flag the directions in which it fades into the Earth's shadow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
