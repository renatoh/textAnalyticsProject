Douglas, 24, has won silver at the last two championships - last year's Europeans in Gothenburg and the European Indoors in Birmingham in March. But he suffered a hamstring tear in Madrid last Saturday, and yesterday it was confirmed he will not recover in time. Dave Collins, UK Athletics' performance director, said: \"It is bad news, particularly for an athlete who in the past has shown his consistency and that he can challenge for major championship medals. His absence will be a great loss.\" Meanwhile the US sprinter Tyson Gay will make another attempt to break the 100 metres world record at the Grand Prix at Crystal Palace on Friday week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
