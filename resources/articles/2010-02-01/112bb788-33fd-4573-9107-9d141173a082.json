But at tonight's 30th anniversary event, the show was stolen by an American as Lady Gaga took home three awards, more than any other artist. The flamboyant artist \u2013 born Stefani Germanotta \u2013 was named best international female solo artist, best international breakthrough act and best international album for The Fame. And while the night may have been billed as the \"battle of the babes\" by many, with female artists giving a strong showing in the nominations, there was also a distinctly masculine feel to the honours, with rock band Kasabian and boy band JLS all taking home awards. Leicester rockers Kasabian won best British band, while JLS picked up breakthrough act. Meanwhile while Florence and the Machine won best British album for Lungs and rapper Dizzee Rascal was named best British male solo artist. At the glittering event hosted by comedian Peter Kay in London's Earl's Court, all eyes were on the American exhibitionist, hotly tipped by bookies since winning two Grammys last month. After scoring four number ones with her debut album, Gaga was lauded as the new queen of pop with the industry queuing to lay accolades at her feet. Past outlandish displays from the American have included full facial masks, exploding bras and pyrotechnics. Last night's performance was met with rapturous applause. Lily Allen also overcame a disappointing night back in 2007, when she was nominated for four awards, but won none. Despite stiff competition from Florence Welch, frontwoman for Florence and the Machine, and newcomer Pixie Lott, she took home the award for British female solo act. Her second album It's Not Me, It's You came out in February last year, after her debut Alright Still sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide. There was joy for Dizzee Rascal, credited with bring grime music to the mainstream, after he took home the award for best British male solo artist. Rascal, the only artist on an independent label \u2013 his own \u2013 burst onto the scene after winning the Mercury music prize in 2003 for his debut Boy in da Corner. But with his latest album, Tongue N' Cheek, he established himself as a household name, and as a star, with three singles released from the album \u2013 Dance Wiv Me, Bonkers and Holiday \u2013 all reaching the top chart slot. The ever-exuberant rapper took to the stage tonight to perform a much-anticipated duet with Florence Welch, dressed in a suitably spangly silver mini dress. The unlikely pair launched themselves into a mash-up of two of their best-known songs \u2013 You Got the Love and Dirtee Cash \u2013 to produce You Got the Dirtee Love. The inexorable rise of Jay-Z continued, as he took home the award for best international male solo artist. The rapper \u2013 who performed to screaming adulation with Alicia Keys \u2013 became the most successful solo artist in the history of the US Billboard chart, after his 11th album, Blueprint 3, went to number one, surpassing Elvis Presley's record. The power of the reality TV format, which last year propelled Susan Boyle to stratospheric heights, was again evident as the teen favourites JLS \u2013 runners-up in the fifth series of the X Factor in 2008 \u2013 won best British breakthrough act. Capitalising on the hysterical fervour of their fans, the band \u2013 described by Kay as \"a black, all-male version of Bucks Fizz\" \u2013 took home best British single. Beat Again, which went straight to the top spot in the charts last summer, was voted for by thousands of radio listeners. It fell to Liam Gallagher to provide some unscripted drama, however, after taking to the stage, minus brother Noel, to accept Oasis's award for the Brits album of 30 years for their record (What's the Story) Morning Glory? After thanking a series of people \u2013 pointedly not including his sibling \u2013 he told the crowd: \"Listen kids \u2026 the best bands in the fucking world live forever,\" before hurling a microphone into the audience. As he left, Kay remarked: \"What a knobhead.\" The industry was tonight hoping that exposure to a prime-time audience would boost album sales, with an award thought to add in the region of \u00a34m to any album sales. The BPI, which organises the event, said the drop was softened to a degree by the growth of digital album sales which now account for 12.5% of the market, and saw a 56.1% increase last year. The crowning glory of the evening, the award for outstanding contribution, went to Brits darling Robbie Williams, who closed the show. The former Take That star \u2013 who has won more Brit awards than any other artist \u2013 took home his 16th award after more than 20 years in the business, saying: \"I feel like it's my birthday, I feel special, it's lovely, whether people think it or not in my head I'm going, 'brilliant!'\" He celebrated his winning run with a triumphant performance, cementing a comeback that started in October. In a nod to the 30 years' worth of performances that have seen Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood bamboozled by a stuck autocue, Robbie Williams offering to fight Liam Gallagher and John Prescott soaked by Chumbawumba, Brits fans were asked to vote for their top performance of the past three decades. The honour, given by Sam Fox, went to the Spice Girls' performance of Wannabe in 1997 \u2011 helped, one imagines, by the enduring image of Geri Halliwell in a Union flag dress. Halliwell looked much more demure for last night's celebration. As Fox took to the stage, she worried she may make another mistake. \"I'd best do it right, or you'll hold it against me for the next 20 years,\" she said.
