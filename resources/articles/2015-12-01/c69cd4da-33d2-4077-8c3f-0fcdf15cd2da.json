Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t seen episodes seven and eight of the third series \u2013 and if you\u2019ve seen further ahead, please do not post spoilers. You can read the previous recaps here. \u201cHey, Wiki!\u201d This, my friends, is as close as we are ever likely to get to a Bridge happy ending. Yes, Saga is being investigated for the murder of her mother and her chances don\u2019t look great \u2013 a motive, no real alibi and forensic evidence against her. Yes, the badly decomposed body that had been in clay for the past six years turned out to be that of Henrik\u2019s wife, Alice, was and his girls may now be out there, alone and still suffering. Yes, Hans is dead and Martin is still in jail. And, yes, Rasmus is still knocking around somewhere, swishing that ponytail of his. But what\u2019s any of that when we had those final looks between this pair of loved up off-duty coppers? When Saga looks over at Henrik, there\u2019s no cold case it doesn\u2019t seem possible to solve, no maniacal serial killer it doesn\u2019t seem plausible that they could catch; such is the power of the touchingly awkward love (is it OK to use the L-word?) blossoming between these two. I haven\u2019t been this happy about a fictional couple since Wall-E fell for Eva. But to those for whom this ending is too saccharine, have no fear, it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll be mini-breaking in Paris anytime soon. Where others might take unemployment or mandatory leave as a good excuse to put on tracky bums and watch Trisha, Saga and Henrik are taking it as a chance to focus on a whole different murder and abduction case, this time of Henrik\u2019s wife and children. Season four \u2013 let\u2019s all cross everything! \u2013 is looking like it would be a brave new world in which Saga and Henrik are actually a couple \u2013 a crime-fighting, trouser-into-boots-tucking couple \u2013 Linn is less Nurse Ratched and more Hans\u2019s slightly grumpy, but somehow worthy, successor; and there\u2019s even a chance that, after his cock-up this week, Rasmus might get the demotion he so heartily deserves. Like we\u2019ve said before, the Saga of the end of season three is a totally different cookie from the Saga that dobbed Martin in at the end of two \u2013 she\u2019s reluctant to even try to save a hanging Emil for his role in Hans\u2019s death, whereas she left Martin no leeway for his equivalent bout of non-regulation thinking. Although she does come out on the right side of the law, it\u2019s a close-run thing. But now, having thought similar thoughts to those that led Martin to murder Jens, might Saga \u201cI can\u2019t socialise with a murderer\u201d Nor\u00e9n relax her stance towards him? We\u2019ve all read that Kim Bodnia\u2019s out, but is it so misguided to think he might allow himself one cheeky prison-visiting-hours cameo? In any case (Martin who?), it\u2019s lucky for Henrik that Saga\u2019s trust in the law \u2013 her genuine innocence in her mother\u2019s case will not guarantee her an innocent verdict \u2013 and belief in the existence of black-and-white right and wrong, has been roughly shaken. It\u2019s highly unlikely that pill-popping Henrik would be be sipping an OJ opposite her at the breakfast table had it not been. And so to the much less gripping business of the murders (as many of you have noted, it speaks volumes about how far this season has come that we\u2019re not all in it just for the high-octane plotlines) \u2013 I, for one, swallowed a giant red herring, bones and all, at the end of these last episodes. Annika as the killer felt too obvious because it was, even if she had had help. As many of you predicted, wild-haired art buff Emil was our man. But, having seemed infernal, was I alone in feeling just a tiny bit sorry for Annika by the end? She hadn\u2019t been revelling in the latest casket designs at a Gothenburg undertakers\u2019 trade fair after all, instead she\u2019d been locked up, just one building over from where a shackled Jeanette had her baby and nearly bled to death, and pretty convincingly stitched up \u2013 Emil had even gone so far as to totally re-do the top floor of her house into a kind of murder HQ. Poor Annika looked crushed when Saga responded with her typical bluntness to her question about whether Claes had reported her missing: \u201cNo. He seemed relieved that you were gone.\u201d And while I think Claes would be wise to continue to fear her wrath, instead of the cold-blooded killer she was painted to be, she turned out to be yet another victim of Emil\u2019s twistedness. So to Emil \u2026 while last week it was already clear what links Emil had to the victims, what wasn\u2019t clear was the link to Holst. This week it turned out that Emil \u2013 dun dun durrrrr \u2013 is actually Freddie Holst\u2019s son. The code that had been on Morten Anker\u2019s fridge and then burned into the mouths of all the victims \u2013 Emil included, yikes \u2013 was in fact the code for the fertility clinic (\u201call the mothers get one\u201d) where a young, Holst had 20 odd years earlier left some of his stash, which had been used by one Anna-Maria Larsson. And therein also lies the explanation for Morten identifying his killer as \u201cbrother\u201d (though wouldn\u2019t he have a different code, since it relates to the mother, not the sperm donor? Why would the same one be on his fridge?). As we learn from Colbert\u2019s CCTV footage, Morten had in fact turned up some weeks earlier, seemingly high, at Freddie\u2019s gate asking to see his father, \u201cor not my father, but the real one. We were supposed to be here, both of us.\u201d Happy families this is not. As with all the previous murders, plans for the last hoorah \u2013 the simultaneous death of father and son, Freddie and Emil, by hanging, and the possible death of Freddie\u2019s new son if the drop from Freddie\u2019s arms was enough to do it \u2013 were stage-managed in the extreme. Again inspired by art, this week the artwork provided one of the last clues Saga and Henrik needed to track Emil down. The painter of the work, A Very Nice Day, one Claus Arnesen, still being alive and kicking and living on Saltholm island, midway between Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen, also provided an excellent excuse to get the police helicopter out for a spin. The barn shown in the painting was but a few-kilometre jog for our crime-fighting pair, and there they found Emil and Freddie hanging, but still alive, with Freddie yet to drop his baby. Phew. As for motive, Emil gives us plenty of insight into his barbed logic, recalling the words Morten Anker had said to him: \u201cWhy should I suffer when those responsible for my torment do not?\u201d; talking of powerlessness, righting wrongs, wanting to make everything his father loved (namely art) \u201cugly and twisted\u201d and ruing the day he was born. It\u2019s a charged exchange between Emil and Saga, with a strong sense that she understands, more than he gives her credit for, what it feels like \u201cnot to want to die\u201d, but rather \u201cwant never to have been born\u201d. A statement that leads her via Hans\u2019s funeral, neatly, though a total emotional mess, back to the train tracks where her sister had killed herself. And so to the final almost unbearably wrought, suspenseful 20 or so minutes where Henrik and Saga must both, in turn, ricochet back from their own individual brinks to save the other from theirs \u2013 what more noir-ish way to bond is there than through this shared grief and sense of hopelessness? As Henrik puts it: \u201cI need you!\u201d And, as she weeps, really weeps, in his arms, it\u2019s brutally clear she needs him too. (What we need is a season four!) Thanks to you all for all your insightful comments. I think the one prediction I made that came good was that you lot out-sleuthed me by a Nordic mile. Thanks for your lovely company! Thoughts and observations Did anyone else think that if they were able to \u201ccheck the masts\u201d to find out where Claes \u2013 who quickly morphed back from the sinister depths he reached last week to become, again, just a bitter ex-friend and \u2013 husband \u2013 had been at the time Marc was killed and Jeanette was abducted, they should be able to do the same for Saga at the time her mum was allegedly murdered?! Grim doesn\u2019t quite cover it for Lars-Ove\u2019s murder scene. Having your genitalia winched off seems a particularly grimy way to go. The conversation between Henrik and Saga about sexual pasts provoked by the quickly dismissed idea that Freddie might actually be Annika\u2019s father was mighty fun. In case Henrik was wondering, he\u2019s not the best she\u2019s had. Will we ever find out who killed Gertrud in season sodding two? How can a man with a bungalow that gross and sartorial sense that centred around co-ordinated polo shirts and V-necks not be guilty of something major? Wherever the man who is now shacked up with Aleksandr\u2019s ex-partner is now, someone needs to keep an eye on him. It seemed a bit harsh that poor Lillian had to deal with so much, taking Henrik out to the site where Alice\u2019s body had been found, all on the eve of Hans\u2019s funeral. Are John, AKA Cypher, on Tina back on, then, after that loving handing over of the USB last week? Speaking of Cypher, how likely is it that he actually swaps in a chapter from the book on crisis support that Saga gifted Julia rather than the usual My Little Pony?
