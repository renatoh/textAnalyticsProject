We had a goal which looked to be OK disallowed, but 3-0 would have been a travesty. Portsmouth came at us in the second half and 2-1 would have been a fairer result, but their penalty attempt was dreadful. It was a very big game for both clubs \u2013 we are virtually safe now, though we have stumbled over the line.

Campbell and Distin played well, but every time Campbell cleared the ball it came back at him. We had nobody in midfield who could create anything and we just couldn't get going \u2013 our first decent football came after 70 minutes. Utaka took a penalty and it's still travelling now, it went so far over the bar. I'm glad we've got 37 points already \u2013 hopefully that might keep us up. If a new owner comes in, Paul Hart may not get the chance to manage us next season. Whoever is in charge will need the funds to replace any players that may be sold in the summer.

We've got enough points now, so we had the beach towels out \u2013 it was more important for Sunderland and that showed. Our display was very poor and not an enticement for buying season tickets. We need to get at least half a team of players in and a new midfield, though one thing we don't want is Joey Barton, who's been linked with us. We had no creativity and are a very dull, functional team at the moment.

We played much better than in recent weeks and got the draw we were looking for. I don't think we deserved to win, to be honest \u2013 we had a lot of possession, but it mainly resulted in shots from outside the area. The mood is quite happy tonight because of Hull losing \u2013 and it will look even better if Newcastle and Middlesbrough draw, though I'd be delighted to see Newcastle in their rightful place in the bottom three.

There were a few chances and Spurs knocked it about a bit, but I can't remember one shot from them. They were playing in their flip-flops, dreaming of a beach. We never really got into it. We've basically run out of players. Our whole spine is gone \u2013 Arteta, Yakubu and now Jagielka. Most teams would not handle that. The plus points were our youngsters, Gosling and Rodwell, who could play in an FA Cup final if they are lucky.

Both teams were strolling. There was no pace in our midfield and no tackling, which says to me that the players did not want to win. The main thing today was how can we play without Lennon, who is probably going to Manchester United at the end of the season. The answer is, we can't. Bentley doesn't seem to have a future at the club, Huddlestone was awful and Jenas doesn't get stuck in either. And can someone tell me what position Keane plays?

There was an incredible response, a prolonged ovation, to acknowledge what Roy Hodgson has done in the past 12 months. There are no stars in this team, but they're not robots, either. Hodgson has coached them to be better and what more can a fan want than to see his players improve through coaching?

Everyone just wants a holiday. But we had 4,000 fans there today, still paying their money and turning up. It was one of the worst performances from Gareth Barry I've seen for three or four years and he wasn't the only one. I think we are resigned to the fact we're going to lose him, but there's an unwillingness from the fans to get on his back, because of the service he's given us. But if he carries on playing like that, no one will want him.

Depending on what happens on Monday night at Newcastle, a lot of us will be expecting to go down. The team don't play with any confidence \u2013 in the first half they looked OK, but when the first goal went in their heads dropped. Unless we go in front, we don't stand too much of a chance at the moment, especially as the games are running out. We should have bought more strikers in January.

Hull had a lot more to play for today, but we still battled much harder than they did. They made the same mistake as everyone else, thinking we would just be a long-ball side, but we have good footballers like Liam Lawrence and Ricardo Fuller, who they could not contain today. We have added quality players to the squad this season, but we need to do the same in the summer if we are to move forward next year.

I won't believe that we do unless we beat Liverpool in the next game. There was a good atmosphere today. I think people have given up and are more relaxed and just want to enjoy the football. In some ways, I think the players have the same attitude. In the past few games we've looked much more like the Albion of the Championship last season. If we go into the final day of the season with a chance, then I'll believe.

It has been a good season, but the sooner it ends the better. We've given up. We spent three months in the top 10, but subconsciously we've switched off having reached the 40-point mark. It was good to see Rodallega get a goal. He's going to be a star next season. I don't understand why Steve Bruce perseveres with Kapo. He was terrible. Zaki went off on a stretcher and I think that's the last we'll see of him.

We didn't look like scoring. Our forwards aren't good enough and they've got Torres and Gerrard \u2013 that's the difference really. I thought it was a penalty, to be honest, but there seemed to be a foul on the West Ham player in the build-up. The ref had a bad five minutes. He booked Di Michele, who just fell over. We're not a bad side, but until we get some new players we're not going to be anything more than a top eight side. I think Europe is gone now. We had to get a result today. But it's been a good season overall.

I'm not sure the scoreline reflected the amount of dominance Liverpool had. The early goal was important. I don't think any defence \u2013 even one at the very top of their game \u2013 would have been able to deal with the run from Gerrard and the ball from Torres. Both full-backs had decent games, but at times West Ham's midfield didn't seem to know what they were supposed to do. All Liverpool fans are Man City supporters today, but if the title is to be lost it's not going to be for want of trying.
