The first job went to an outplanted Treasury man, John Gieve. He knows no more about police and prisons than you would glean from managing spending inside Whitehall - which in the case of the Home Office has meant nodding while Jack Straw wastes large sums on expanding prisons. At the education department a senior insider, David Normington, is being promoted. Nothing new, then, about the way the civil service allocates its plums. Mr Normington has, to be fair, experience from near the frontline: he used to run the employment service in London and the south-east. Mr Gieve knows a lot about banking and financial regulation but is innocent of practical management experience. But that is only a criticism if the permanent secretary at the Home Office is meant to be a \"manager\". Is he? Prisons are run by a semi-autonomous agency and the police by an oligarchy of chief constables. As for policy advice, Mr Straw, or whoever succeeds him after June, will prefer special advisers, Lord Norman Warner and the Daily Mail to a civil servant with no experience behind bars, as it were. What permanent secretaries are supposed to be for is one of the many obscurities around the centre of British government, which Labour has demonstrated little interest in illuminating. At least so far. Pressure is growing on Tony Blair to interest himself in the machinery. Foot and mouth has brought critical attention on the geography of Whitehall's departments. Why do we still have a producer-oriented Ministry of Agriculture? A spate of recent reports have mapped out alternatives, while warning that boundary changes may just be deckchair rearrangement. The Institute of Public Policy Research has just dispatched a memo* on remodelling which urges a prime minister's department - a new department for the nations and regions - and replacing the lord chancellor with a proper ministry of justice not headed by the chief of the judges. In its end-of-term reports**, the Commons' public administration committee notes growing incoherence which Labour's constitutional reforms have exacerbated. If policies for children or older people need to be \"joined up\" (the MPs have an interesting suggestion here for a new \"council of the professions\"), so does admin. Officials work with a host of different performance measurements. On the one hand local councils are encouraged - by the proposal for elected mayors - but on the other, ministers and public insist on common standards for schools and childcare, which involves more central direction, as Tony Travers noted on this page yesterday. Ministers' political fate depends on delivery but they have been unwilling to rethink the disarticulated system that produces health care, education or social inclusion. Meanwhile, e-government is coming. And with its band of special advisers and thinktanks Labour has (unconsciously) devalued Whitehall's role in policy advice. No wonder civil servants have identity problems. Pat Dunleavy, of the London School of Economics, notes how under trained the UK senior civil service is by international comparison; yet the complexity of the public policy problems they advise on keeps growing. Tony Wright, Labour chairman of the public administration committee, says it adds up to a case for a royal com mission or similar thoroughgoing, external look - not just at Whitehall but public service as a whole. Leadership is in short supply at the local level as well as centrally, the Cabinet Office performance and innovation unit (PIU) notes in a recent report. You cannot just confine the argument to paid officials. They can only be as good as the politicians to whom they answer and that in turn depends on the quality of the conversation we have about public functions; our rightwing, irresponsible media lower the tone considerably. The cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson, is the closest thing we have to a representative figure for public service but anachronistic and still sadly snobbish distinctions between \"civil\" and \"public\" service prevent him fulfilling a much-needed role. Before anything happens, Number 10 will have to accept that public administration deserves the prime minister's fullest attention. It is about more than money. Work commissioned by the PIU from consultants Hay suggests that at senior levels pay differences are not so stark. The public positions listed in the chart offer security of tenure and the prospect of intangible rewards (knighthoods, for example) which private business people may lack. Top jobs in the public sector are intellectually demanding - which ought to be an incentive. But ultimately a gap in material rewards at the top, albeit a smallish one, is justified only if the culture and ethos of public service is sound and secure. On this score the Blair government has been puzzlingly inactive. It promised a civil service act to put the operations of Whitehall on a statutory and so more accountable footing. Its tergiversation about freedom of information represents a missed opportunity to link greater openness with reaffirmation of public purpose. *Remodelling Whitehall, IPPR **Commons public administration committee, seventh report, Making government work, the emerging issues david.walker@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
