The problem was revealed in a routine check-up several months ago and saw Ferguson, who will celebrate his 62nd birthday on New Year's Eve, spend two hours in a Manchester hospital before being allowed home. The treatment showed there is no underlying problem with Ferguson's heart and the long-serving United manager is due back at the club's Carrington training ground tomorrow to continue preparations for Saturday's Premiership encounter with Aston Villa. \"Sir Alex Ferguson received treatment in hospital today following a routine check-up several months ago which revealed a minor heart irregularity,\" said a United statement. \"The procedure went well and Sir Alex Ferguson is resting at home and is due in work tomorrow. The treatment revealed he has no underlying heart problem.\" Ferguson entered hospital just hours after returning from Birmingham where he watched a largely second-string United side suffer a surprise 2-0 Carling Cup defeat to Nationwide League leaders West Brom. It is not thought the treatment will affect on-going talks over an extension to his current contract, which expires in 2005. In the past few weeks, Ferguson has maintained his stance that his decision to perform a u-turn on his widely-publicised retirement plans two years was one of the wisest moves he has ever made. Ferguson said at the time he felt healthy and able to continue handling the pressures of management at one of the world's biggest clubs and is unlikely to let this minor setback affect his focus. Diagnosis of the problem does vindicate the League Managers' Association insistence that their members continually monitor their health. It is less than six months since former West Ham boss Glenn Roeder was rushed to hospital with what turned out to be a brain tumour. It was later confirmed Roeder had not previously received medical advice in line with LMA recommendations. Ferguson's initial check-up was in line with the LMA programme and while it is not known whether a failure to pick up the problem at an early stage would have led to a worsening of the situation, it proves the value of men in one of the most pressurised jobs of all paying close attention to their health."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
