The subject has barely been raised in a flurry of recent responses to the Government's consultative Green Paper on pensions, even though single female pensioners are already one of the poorest groups of old people, with nearly a quarter of them living in poverty. The Green Paper dedicates a chapter to the specific issues surrounding women and pensions, yet it fails to suggest any practical solutions. Now, however, reforms are being suggested in a campaign by the charity Age Concern and the Fawcett Society, a women's rights think-tank. 'It seems there's a general recognition inside the Government that they haven't performed well on the issue of women and pensions, so there is an open door to reforms in this area,' says Scott Davidson, campaign manager at Age Concern. The reforms suggested by the two bodies, if taken up by the Government, could eliminate many of the anomalies that now make funding retirement more difficult for women. 'The state system is based on an old model which thinks of men as breadwinners and women as the stay-at-home carers,' says Dr Katherine Rake, the society's director. 'This is out of date now for both women and men. 'The whole national insurance system, which has not been reviewed since 1948, is badly designed for today's labour market.' At present, for every pound of income received by a man in a pensioner couple, a woman receives less than 40 pence. In the last financial year, when the basic state pension was \u00a375.50, men averaged \u00a373.45 a week while women received an average \u00a351.24 a week. One major cause is that women's working patterns differ because they are more likely to take career breaks to have children or look after elderly relatives. Old people are not entitled to any state pension unless they qualify for 25 per cent of the full amount. To qualify for this men have to contribute for 44 years and women for 39, although this is due to be equalised. It means that women must have worked for nearly 10 years to qualify for anything, and men for 11. Many women may have worked for eight or nine years, and made national insurance contributions throughout that time, but still get no pension at all. Age Concern and the Fawcett Society are dismissive of the proposed benefits of the Government's new pensions credit, which take effect in October. This aims to reward savings, yet it goes only to people entitled to the full pension. Only 49 per cent of women qualify for this, compared with 92 per cent of men, according to government figures. 'The Pensions Credit system is enormously complex. When I was at the London School of Economics a colleague and I, with 20 years of working in pensions between us, went through the pensions credit and it took us a day to get our heads around it,' says Rake. The two bodies want the '25 per cent rule' to be abolished and the number of years of contributions needed for a full basic pen sion to be cut. They are calling, too, for a non-means tested pension large enough to cover an elderly person's basic living costs. The two groups are also calling on the Government to reconsider the level of the lower earnings limit, which triggers payment of national insurance contributions. Women earn less per hour on average than men - \u00a310.22 compared to \u00a312.59 - and tend to work fewer hours due to greater childcare commitments. The Department of Work and Pensions says about 1.4 million women are paid less than the lower earnings limit, which was \u00a375 a week last year. Age Concern and the Fawcett Society want everyone with earnings to be included in the NI system. 'At an absolute minimum, those working 16 hours at the minimum wage should be building up pension and benefit rights,' they say. The two bodies would also like action on the Home Responsibilities Protection (HRP) system, which protects pension entitlement for peo ple unable to work because they look after relatives. This allows for up to 19 years out of the labour market to be treated as though the person concerned has been making NI contributions. The two bodies say this system is little known and difficult to understand. One problem is that it covers calendar years rather than tax years, so if a woman has a baby at the end of April, she will not qualify for it for the following year as she will be deemed only to have been 'caring' for 11 months. Additionally, if a women combines work and caring she cannot claim eligibility y for NI in those periods.The groups would like HRP to be replaced by a single system of credits to carers, so qualifying for the pension would be based on a combination of caring - and other - credits and NI contributions in any one tax year. 'HRP is not a credit at the moment, it just works by reducing the eligibility requirements,' says Rake. 'It's time to look again at giving a positive credit for caring.' The two groups warn that the situation for women is set to worsen. According to the latest statistics, from the year to September 2002 the number of recently retired women shot up by 12.9 per cent to 249,000, compared to a rise of just 2.8 per cent of men. The figures reflect a baby boom during and after the Second World War. Fifty thousand women born then are due to retire every year for the next five years. While many of them will struggle to manage in retirement, they are unlikely to be the last generation of women to face poverty in their old age. 'Unless there are serious changes in policy, future generations are going to be worse off than their mothers and their grandmothers' generations,' says Rake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
