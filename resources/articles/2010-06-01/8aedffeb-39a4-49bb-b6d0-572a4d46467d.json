In an interview with the Observer, he moved to defuse public anger about the impact of heavy cuts by distancing himself and the coalition government from Thatcherism: \"It is important that people understand that fiscal retrenchment does not mean a repeat of the 1980s. We're going to do this differently.\" The deputy prime minister argued there was an assumption on the centre-left that austerity measures were, by definition, regressive and rightwing: \"And I think principally the reason is because collective memory of difficult budget decisions harks back to the 1980s, the harshness of the 1980s, north-south divide, sink-or-swim economics..\" But he argued that some of the biggest cuts programmes across the world in recent decades had been carried out by \"centre-left governments\", including \"the social democrats in Sweden, the Clinton administration [in the US] and the Liberals in Canada\". He talked about the case in Canada in the mid-1990s, when the government went around the country gaining widespread public support by arguing the case for cuts over tax rises. \"They made some really big, difficult decisions on transfer payments, on benefits, on welfare, really painful ones. They brought people along with them by not just doing the... top-down approach from some windowless room in the Treasury, as happened in the 1980s [in Britain], but genuinely trying to engage people. So you're going to see a level of public engagement in this that you've never seen in this country before.\" Clegg's attack on Margaret Thatcher's policies risk angering the right of the Tory party. Meanwhile, Labour has attacked him for changing his position on the deficit. Before the election his party warned that \u00a36bn of immediate cuts risked pushing Britain into a double-dip recession. Clegg said he had been convinced by Bank of England governor Mervyn King and the situation in Greece. The \u00a36bn was a small part of the deficit that gave \"breathing space\" and provided a necessary \"signal\" to the market that the government was willing to act, he said. He argued that failing to deal with the deficit would result in a confidence slump in the economy that would have an impact on jobs while interest rates would spike, hitting people who depended on low rates for their livelihoods. He warned Britain was spending more on servicing its debt than on defence and policing. \"I say this with such urgency because I think what's happening, bluntly, among the kind of centre-left community is a huge mistake in thinking that even tackling the fiscal crisis is an unprogressive thing to do. Not tackling it would be a greater betrayal of our ideals.\" Clegg will tour a number of European capitals this week, stressing that the coalition government wants to lead the debate in Europe. He said what was happening in the eurozone was crucial because Britain needed European markets to export to if it was to recover. He is expected to make an announcement within days or weeks about the timing of a referendum on a new voting system, and warned he would use his authority ruthlessly to make sure the coalition's early commitments happen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
