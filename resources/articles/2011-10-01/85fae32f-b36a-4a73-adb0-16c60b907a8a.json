Those results were leavened by improvements in Microsoft's Office business. Net income for the quarter to the end of September rose 6% to $5.7bn, compared to $5.4bn the year before. Even though revenues at its Windows business rose to $4.87bn, up 1.7%, slightly below the 2% growth in shipments in the PC business excluding Apple, profits in the division fell by 1% to $3.25bn. The fall in profit reflects the problems the company faces with piracy in China and the Far East, which are the growth markets for PC sales - a point that chief executive Steve Ballmer has previously emphasised, saying that the company gets only 1/20 as much revenue from Windows PCs sold in China as it does in the US. But the Redmond-based software giant saw strong growth in sales and profits at its Office business, where the 2010 package drove revenues up 7.7% to $5.6bn and profits up 5.7% to $3.7bn. The overall results were in line with analysts' forecasts. Microsoft's shares, which have traded in the $20-$30 range for the last decade, fell 0.5% in after-hours trading, to $26.87. They closed at $27.04 on Nasdaq. \"We still had Windows miss again, although not by nearly as much as it has the last couple quarters,\" said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. \"They were just in line on EPS [earnings per share], which typically Microsoft beats,\" said Barnicle. \"[Fiscal] first quarter is seasonally not a big quarter for Microsoft, and this was no exception.\" The continuing weak point remains its Online Services division, which houses its Bing search engine. But that showed signs of improvement, with revenues up 18.6% to $625m - though still lower than in the previous three quarters - and the continuing losses significantly narrower, at $494m, compared to a $560m loss a year before. The Online Services division has not made a profit since the Christmas period of 2005, and Microsoft's interest in buying Yahoo is reckoned to stem from its desire to make its search alliance there pay. Even so, some analysts felt that it might have turned a corner, with the loss being its smallest for the past seven quarters. Bing's US market share grew by 3.5 percentage points to reach 14.7% year over year, but Yahoo's share of search - which is driven by Bing - fell so that the companies' combined share was just 27%. The Entertainment &amp; Devices division, which includes the Xbox gaming console and the Windows Phone smartphone products, saw revenues grow 9.4% to $1.96bn although profits fell 8.8% to $352m. Longer-term trends The fall in the Windows division's profits point to longer-term shifts in the computer business as markets in the west slow down and China and the Far East become the new growth markets. Microsoft has seen the revenues and profits that it gets per Windows PC sold drop steadily even over the past four years, from per-PC payments above $60 at the end of 2007 towards $56 in the latest quarter, using the published figures from Microsoft and the calculations of PCs shipped from the research companies Gartner and IDC. The profit per PC has also dropped substantially in the same period, from nearly $50 per PC to just just over $37 now, though in the previous quarter it was just over $32. The longer-term trend though means that Microsoft needs to find fresh ways to persuade people in the west to buy pricier PCs, or to encourage new growth trends. That is clearly part of the drive behind its new Windows 8 \"Metro\" design, unveiled in September, which will be available in about a year's time and is intended to run both on standard desktop computers and also on tablet devices - where so far Microsoft has fallen well behind Apple's iPad and the many vendors offering tablets running Google's Android software. Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of Ycmnet, said: \"The numbers are not terribly unexpected. What is most critical is looking at the revenue transition from PC sales to alternatives. With the computer slowdown, the more the gaming becomes a bigger part of what they are doing, the more important it becomes to the business. I know they also swallowed Skype which impacted their financial results. I wouldn't call this quarter a disaster but it does underscore a company in transition. They realise they are in transition and they are trying their best to move into gaming and tablets and move into the cloud. \"Their old earnings line is going to get compressed. The Windows 8 announcement is interesting, but in a tough economy I'd be surprised if any companies step up to buy Windows 8, and it's in the upgrade where Microsoft makes money.\" Trip Chowdhry, analyst at Global Equities Research, said: \"A big question mark for Microsoft is what is the next multibillion [customer] problem that Microsoft is going to solve?\" He suggested the stock won't go up until Microsoft identifies this problem. \"Coming up with the next version of an existing product is not a strategy,\" Chowdhry said. \"Somehow Microsoft has failed to identify new markets both from a product perspective and business perspective. I don't think its stock can go up with the current product line they have. I don't think Windows 8 will propel the stock above $30.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
