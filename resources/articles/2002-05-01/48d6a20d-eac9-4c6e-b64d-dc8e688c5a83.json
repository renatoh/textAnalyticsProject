And \"remixing\" often turns a classic into fluff - just ask Sly Stone. But despite all my reservations, I ended up enjoying this album in all its sacrilegious, sugary glory. It's a guilty treat - eccentric and compelling. On Wait 'Till You See Him, Ella Fitzgerald gleams distantly through the electronic fog of De Phazz, whose trombonist, Otto Engelhardt, blows along breezily. Astrud Gilberto sounds more at home in Thievery Corporation's remix of Who Needs Forever? than she did in her awful 1960s cover of Light My Fire (featured in the DJ duo's compilation Sounds from the Verve Hi-Fi , on Universal Jazz). The tracks that work best allow the feel of the original to come through, as on the glorious Masters at Work remix of Nina Simone's See-Line Woman (to be released as a vinyl-only single) and MJ Cole's version of Carmen McRae's How Long Has This Been Going On? The weaker tracks - mixes by UFO, Tricky and King Britt - are conveniently relegated to the back of the CD. And when you tire of tricks like the relentless cowbell and dirty brass sample of Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby (mixed by Rae and Christian), or all those hollow, lo-fi kick drums, you can go back to the sources on Verve Unmixed (Universal Jazz). A quick listen to the originals prompts the thought that it is easier to do a really creative reworking when the master is not a timeless classic: in other words, stay away from Billie Holiday and get stuck in to Dinah Washington and Willie Bobo. Ruisort's Acapulco Now! (Certificate Eighteen) is another confection of chilled, late-night jazzy stuff, this time from Mexico. There are cliched signifiers on the cover in the shape of a donkey and a wide-brimmed hat, but these dance grooves are constructed in the international style: repetitive and not overly eventful. Yet compared to his younger compatriots in the Nortec Collective, Ruisort (real name Alvaro Ruiz) is less bleepy and anoraky, more relaxed and colourful. The best moments on Acapulco Now! are laced with the brief, tasty keyboard phrases that form Ruisort's signature. Musical surprises include a Beatles cover (And I Love Her) and some nifty trumpet from El Super Ration on Ipanema 5-0, which is also a single. Though this is a largely up-tempo, life-affirming collection of mixes, the Mexican way of death raises its grinning skull on the charmingly titled Pimp's Corpse Dub. According to the record company press release, the Chicago quartet Town &amp; Country applied a kind of inverted Old Grey Whistle Test in preparing their latest album C'mon (Thrill Jockey) in \"an abandoned shack\" on Chicago's South Side. \"If the kids in the park next door dug what they heard it stayed, if they didn't they threw it out.\" I think this is a joke. The title draws on the same sense of deadpan humour, implying the North American heartiness you'd find in a good ol' guitar band. The only guitars used by Town &amp; Country are acoustic, which they blend with chimes, celeste, bass clarinet, string bass and so on. The resulting all-acoustic album has some of the qualities of the late Simon Jeffes's Penguin Cafe Orchestra, an appealing intersection of folk-pop music and the tonal, written-out music of composers such as Morton Feldman and Howard Skempton. Town &amp; Country are not afraid to be repetitive, in a post-minimalism, pre-sampling manner. You may need to slow down a little to get the most out of it. It's like staring at an apparently featureless landscape and noticing the patterns and details, and the way the shadows slowly change. Sometimes something is taken away or removed, but the drama is muted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
