But you wouldn\u2019t have known either from the enormous, coffee table-sized dossier Pep Guardiola was carrying through the corridors of Bayern Munich\u2019s S\u00e4bener Strasse headquarters before October\u2019s home game against Cologne, the sort of game his club \u2013 the unassailable leaders, who had walked all nine of their Bundesliga matches at that point \u2013 were expected to win at a canter. The manager locked himself in his office to study videos of the mid-table team for hours on end and emerged the next day to provide his side with a detailed analysis of where space could be found. Cologne made life difficult with a five-man defence and 10 men behind the ball at the Allianz Arena. But spaces began to open up in precisely in the areas Guardiola had mapped out in the team meeting. Bayern took full advantage to destroy the visitors 4-0, leaving one long-serving member of the coaching staff shaking his head on the sideline, a disbelieving grin on his face. \u201cPep, he\u2019s a genius,\u201d the same club employee said two months later as he described that example of Guardiola\u2019s attention to detail. There are countless similar anecdotes that tell of the 44-year-old\u2019s professional dedication since pitching up in the Bavarian capital in the summer of 2013. Talk to any of the former greats on the Bayern board or even to employees who can view the senior team\u2019s training pitch from their canteen, and they all, to a man, volunteer that they have never seen a manager as brilliant as Guardiola at work. Practice sessions are varied and intense, team talks nothing short of enlightening. Another influential Bayern official not prone to exaggeration told the Observer that \u201cGuardiola thinks about football and understands the machinations of the game at a level so deep that no one can follow\u201d. The midfielder Toni Kroos worked under J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, Louis van Gaal, Jupp Heynckes, Carlo Ancelotti and Rafael Ben\u00edtez, but he, too, recently said that Guardiola, his manager at Bayern in 2013-14, \u201cwas the best coach I ever had in terms of his football ideas, his plans for playing against sides and presenting solutions to his own team\u201d. A Champions League trophy has eluded the Spaniard in Munich but the club have been extremely pleased with the team\u2019s development into football\u2019s equivalent of the Terminator II model: they can shift shape at will, adapt to any situation and take down their opponents in a myriad ways. The constant tactical demands on his players, overbearing at first, and a remarkable work rate without the ball have resulted in many of them reaching levels not seen before. David Alaba has grown into one of the world\u2019s most accomplished all-rounders on Guardiola\u2019s watch, defender J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng sprays 60m pinpoint passes and roving forward Thomas M\u00fcller now commands a nine-figure price tag. That\u2019s the \u201cgenius\u201d bit covered. For all his charming, approachable demeanour outside the stadium, Guardiola has proved more high-maintenance and difficult to work with than anticipated. He still has not come to terms with a corporate culture that sees key figures frequently engage in robust exchanges of views. In turn, Bayern do not understand why he has often sent assistants or advisers to raise important issues with the board, instead of talking to them directly. The lack of open communication has bred mistrust on both sides, especially since the summer\u2019s tour of China. The otherwise successful trip ended on a very frosty note when the club chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, innocuously remarked that life at Bayern would continue even if the manager did not renew his existing contract beyond June 2016. Guardiola took huge offence and sulked throughout the flight home to Germany. He was also upset that the Bayern president, Franz Beckenbauer, criticised the team\u2019s play as over-elaborate in the wake of their humiliating Champions League semi-final defeat by Real Madrid in 2014. Confidants explained he felt his footballing ideals were gravely misunderstood in Munich. There were endless rows with Bayern\u2019s club doctor, Hans-Wilhelm M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt, over players\u2019 recurring injuries. The 73-year-old resigned in protest after nearly four decades at the club in April \u2013 Rummenigge had taken Guardiola\u2019s side in their long-running dispute \u2013 but Kicker reported on Thursday that M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt\u2019s successor, Dr Volker Braun, has also fallen out with Guardiola over the latest setback for Franck Rib\u00e9ry. The Frenchman will miss the next eight weeks with a muscle tear. Some of the coaching staff and a few of the German contingent have privately expressed reservations about the manager forsaking traditional fitness drills for exercises with the ball. It could well be a simple question of habit: they are not used to working that way. Some players have done extra sessions in their own time to make up for the perceived deficit, which might well have proved counter-productive. In the past two seasons Bayern\u2019s performance levels have dropped a little after the winter break and injuries have piled up. As much as Guardiola\u2019s exacting methods and complex personality have exhausted the club, Bayern would still have been prepared to overlook it all to tie him down for a few more years. Such has been the impression he has made in pure footballing terms. But he has got other plans. Sources close to Guardiola insist that he always intended to leave at the end of his contract, that there are no specific reasons why he has turned down a new deal. Now that the game\u2019s most in-demand coach is about to announce his departure at the end of the season, Bayern are hopeful that his three-year stint can still deliver a happy ending. When the Bavarians revealed that Guardiola would take over from Heynckes, in January 2013, players and the incumbent coach were galvanised to deliver the treble five months later. Maybe history can repeat itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
