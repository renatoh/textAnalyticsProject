Two days before the chancellor's 11th and final budget, the poll also highlights voters' anxiety about the growing financial squeeze on households and the amount they are paying in tax. The findings show Mr Brown's recent charm offensive has yet to convince the public that he will make a good prime minister; the gulf between the two parties has widened in the last month. A small but significant number of voters switch away from Labour when reminded that Mr Brown would probably lead the party at the next election, and a similar number are attracted to the Tories by David Cameron. But voters also appear to acknowledge his success in managing the economy since 1997. A majority agreed that the last 10 years had been prosperous, despite widespread anxiety about tax levels, the rising cost of living and the effectiveness of investment in public services. According to ICM, voters give the Conservatives a 10-point lead, up a point from last month, when asked whom they would back in a general election tomorrow. The poll puts the Tories on 41%, Labour unchanged on 31% and the Liberal Democrats down one at 18%. The Tories last scored above 40% in August 1992. But when asked which party they would support in a contest between Mr Brown, Mr Cameron and Sir Menzies Campbell, Tory support rises by two points to 43%, while Labour's drops by three to 28% - a 15-point gap. The Lib Dems are unchanged on 18%. Last month, the gap between Mr Brown and Mr Cameron was 13 points, a gulf which raised alarm among MPs about the chancellor's electoral appeal. The consolidation of that effect is likely to unsettle them further. Mr Brown's supporters argue that he cannot be judged until he becomes leader, not least since he is constrained from setting out his agenda fully. Others suggest he is holding back from revealing his policy ideas so that he can make an impact when he enters Downing Street. But a succession of recent ICM polls has made gloomy reading for the chancellor and the Liberal Democrat leader. \"To judge from the data, what you are left with is the fact that Cameron is an asset to his party and neither Brown nor Campbell are,\" said Nick Sparrow, the managing director of ICM. The research offers the chancellor some comfort. Most people think the last 10 years have been prosperous for both Britain as a whole (56%) and for them and their families (61%). A majority also feel the current levels of tax and spending are broadly reasonable. Asked whom \"people like you\" are most likely to support at the next election, 51% chose a party that maintained existing rates. Only 21% wanted tax cuts if they might mean spending less on public services, while another 21% thought taxes should be raised to increase investment. But 71% thought the extra money Labour had lavished on education and health had been spent badly so far. There was also clear concern that household finances were being squeezed. Questioned on which issues were the main worries for themselves and their families, 74% picked the levels of council tax and 67% cited income tax. Another 72% chose rising prices and 65% the risk that houses might become unaffordable. Taxes on motoring and aviation remain unpopular, with 36% approving of them and 62% disapproving, despite concerns about climate change. If green levies were imposed, 58% think they should be used to fund environmental projects, while 36% think they should fund other tax cuts. \u00b7 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,011 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between March 16 and 18.
