There was hardly a welcome of party-poppers and streamers, yet, having left Crystal Palace five weeks ago as they capsized into administration, a token spattering of yolk over Warnock's back would have been understandable. Arriving as the Queens Park Rangers manager, the 61-year-old had even declined the chance of a backdoor entrance to face the potential wrath of his former fans. So much for the indictment by Palace's administrator, Brendan Guilfoyle, that Warnock was not a fighter. His exit from the club was shrouded in rancour, but Warnock was not ducking any confrontations on his return. \"They said to me: 'Do you want to come off the back door [of the coach] with all the players so you won't have to face this lot?' And I said: 'No, I want to come off the front \u2013 why should I not come out and smile at them?\" Warnock said. \"I wondered about the missiles because I'd got a new suit on. I thought there'd be eggs and everything thrown at me, but I wasn't hit.\" Warnock's players gave evidence of their courage, too, as they comfortably beat the hosts to assuage relegation fears. Goals in either half from Akos Buzsaky and Kaspars Gorkss broke Palace. Buzskay's 11th-minute strike was unstoppable, but Gorkss's header on the hour could have been prevented had the Latvian been sufficiently opposed as he glanced home Adel Taarabt's corner. Palace cannot afford to be so gratuitously benevolent. \"It was a weird game,\" Warnock said. \"We were winning 2-0 and I wasn't enjoying it. It's never felt like this before [against a former club] and it never will again.\" The Rangers defender Damion Stewart and Palace striker Calvin Andrew will have chequered memories of the match. With little more than 10 seconds gone, the two clashed heads with such force it fractured Stewart's skull. For Palace, the headache of a relegation battle lingers. One point is all that keeps them above the drop zone with three games remaining."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
