Pro-reform demonstrators mourning the death of Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri clashed with security forces earlier this week and were planning to hold more ceremonies on Sunday to honour the seventh day of his passing, one of Shia Islam's ritual mourning milestones. But two opposition websites reported that authorities have banned all services except those in his birthplace and the holy city of Qom. In another sign that Tehran is trying to stamp out dissent, a former Iranian government spokesman who joined the opposition movement was sentenced to six years in prison, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. Abdullah Ramezanzadeh, who backed opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi in the disputed presidential vote in June, was charged with fomenting unrest. He was found guilty of \"acts against national security, propagating against the Islamic establishment and keeping classified documents\", according to Fars. The trial of Ramezanzadeh, who served until 2004 as spokesman under reformist President Mohammad Khatami, was part of mass proceedings under way against more than 100 leading moderates, opposition figures and supporters who have challenged President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's disputed re-election in June. More than 50 people were arrested earlier this week in a mosque in Isfahan, Iran's second biggest city, reformist websites reported, as police fired pepper spray and teargas at mourners paying their respects to Montazeri, who died on Sunday. There was also anti-government unrest in Najafabad, Montazeri's birthplace, where protests that began on Tuesday reportedly continued on Wednesday despite a large security presence. The reformist website Parlemannews described the situation as \"tense\". Government supporters had earlier attacked Montazeri's house, prompting his sons to cancel a mourning ceremony. Witnesses said the cleric leading the Isfahan event was attacked by agents spraying pepper gas. Security forces detained another cleric, Ayatollah Jalaleddin Taheri \u2013 who was said to have organised the event \u2013 and surrounded his house to prevent him attending. Another website, Rah-e Sabz, said a large deployment of security forces had failed to calm the situation and crowds were continuing to chant anti-government slogans. In a separate incident, in the south-eastern town of Sirjan, at least two people were said to have been killed and scores injured when crowds tried to stop the public execution of two men condemned to death for armed robbery. The incidents followed Monday's mass funeral for Montazeri in Qom, which turned into a huge demonstration against the government by a crowd estimated at hundreds of thousands. The death of Montazeri has galvanised the opposition Green Movement, which had been seeking to keep alive protests over the election. The cleric had emerged as the movement's spiritual leader after he issued a flurry of statements condemning the election result and the crackdown that followed. Further ceremonies are scheduled on the 40th day of his death, which will coincide with Safar, during which the Prophet Muhammad's death is commemorated. It was a cycle of violent mourning ceremonies in 1978 that created the momentum that toppled the former Shah and led to the Islamic revolution. The government served notice it is not prepared to back away from a showdown when the police chief, Esmail Ahmadi-Moghaddam, threatened the opposition with fierce confrontation if it continued illegal activities. Rah-e-Sabz said regular security forces were being augmented by violent criminals to intimidate demonstrators."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
