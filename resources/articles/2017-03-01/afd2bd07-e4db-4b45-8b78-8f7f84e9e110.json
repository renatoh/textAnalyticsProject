Townsend takes over at the end of the season in a change that has looked increasingly surprising as the Six Nations has progressed with the New Zealander, now moving to Montpellier, signing off as the only Scotland coach of the professional era with a win ratio better than 50%. Townsend\u2019s credentials are obvious, however. Hogg was part of the Glasgow side he guided to a first Pro12 title in 2015 while the Warriors have beaten Leicester and Racing 92 home and away this season to reach the Champions Cup quarter\u2011finals for the first time and, perhaps most significantly, he is Scottish. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a tour of Australia in the summer and, with [Gregor] coming in, the Glasgow boys are fully aware of what he can bring,\u201d Hogg said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting times for Scottish rugby. Much the same to what he brings at Glasgow, we tend to play expansive rugby. Nothing for us really changes from Glasgow to Scotland. Both coaches want us to go out there and play an expansive game and ultimately score tries. It\u2019s an exciting time. \u201cVern\u2019s a very passionate guy. He\u2019s put everything into Scotland and you can see how much it means to him. I listened to an interview with him the other day and he\u2019s done a phenomenal job. He\u2019s worked wonders for me and for Scottish rugby and we thank him for absolutely everything that he\u2019s done and he\u2019ll be missed. Montpellier are very lucky to have a coach like that.\u201d Hogg will almost certainly not be on that tour to Australia, however \u2013 the 24-year-old is nailed on for his second tour with the British &amp; Irish Lions, in New Zealand this summer, after another impressive tournament. He scored three tries and was the provider for three of Scotland\u2019s four tries in the 29-0 win against Italy, finished by Matt Scott, Tim Visser and Tommy Seymour. His defence is often questioned but he made two fine tackles early in the second half with Italy threatening in the right-hand corner. \u201cI\u2019ve been fairly disappointed with the way I\u2019ve defended but you are never the complete player so I\u2019ve worked hard on it and thankfully it came my way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one game isn\u2019t good enough for me. It\u2019s on to the next game.\u201d While the scoreline may suggest otherwise, Scotland were not quite in top gear and Italy were left to rue three missed penalties from Carlo Canna and a sustained period of pressure after half-time that produced no reward. They have now suffered 12 consecutive Six Nations defeats but Conor O\u2019Shea can take heart from how Cotter turned things round with Scotland after a first campaign ended with five defeats. \u201cI know how far we have to go,\u201d the Italy coach said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hurting at the moment but I\u2019m not in it for my ego. \u201cI\u2019m in it for Italy rugby and to put it in a better place. Hopefully, like Vern a couple of years ago, we can do that. I think Vern came in on the back of a Glasgow team that was beginning to turn the corner and we need to make sure our two franchises turn the corner. I know that we can get to the [2019] World Cup with a team like Argentina had in 1999. If we do that, we\u2019ll have done the biggest favour for Italy rugby and that\u2019s our job. Everybody else has improved and we\u2019ve stood still. But if egos are put into pockets and the national team comes first, we have a chance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
