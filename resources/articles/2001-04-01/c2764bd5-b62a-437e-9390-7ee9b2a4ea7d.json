Leeds manager David O'Leary wanted Bayern Munich while Deportivo's president, Cesar-Augusto Lendoiro, fancied Manchester United. 'I'd have preferred to be facing Bayern,' O'Leary admitted. 'I think the Spanish League is the best in Europe and Deportivo won it last year. They might not have the name of Barcelona or Real Madrid but they are an excellent side with some really talented players. We have not got the name of Manchester United or Arsenal, but we are not a bad side either.' True enough. Neither club have aristocratic soccer pedigree and in centre-back Donato, a roly-poly Brazilian who looks to have a girth never approached by Maradona or Paul Gascoigne at their weightiest, Deportivo have an unlikely campaigner who spells trouble for O'Leary and his side. Donato may not be skipper - that's Fran Gonzalez, arguably the weakest link of the side - but he holds everything together around his ample frame. At 38 he is Spain's oldest outfield player at the top level, and although he may look podgy, slow and unwieldy, and glories in the nickname of Abuelo , or Grandad, he reads the game superbly and makes the issue of speed irrelevant. He has already been offered a contract extension. Donato packs one hell of a free-kick so comparisons with Ian Harte's technique will be interesting. His thunderbolts are known as 'Donatazos' by his adoring fans. And it was Donato's headed goal that broke the deadlock, settled his side and sent them on their way to their title in the final game of last season. There were those who raised eyebrows when Deportivo paid Atletico Madrid \u00a3400,000 for the old boy eight years ago and it is remarkable that he keeps up to the standard after a career spanning more than 20 years - which began with Vasco da Gama in his native Brazil. He's part of a Brazilian-spiced side that has Spaniards at its core after Lendoiro decided to go local and buy only Spanish players or those already settled in the league. This followed a disastrous flirtation with buying cheap foreigners - the accompanying passport scandal still haunts the club - and within a year of the new policy, the dividend came with the Liga title. Directing team affairs is coach Jabo Irureta, backed by Lendoiro's ability always to turn a profit on a transfer deal (notably, \u00a34 million pocketed from the sale of Sylvain Wiltord to Arsenal from a sell-on clause - he never kicked a ball for Deportivo). Between them they have created a small-town force, drawing on a population of just 240,000, with the ability to kick big-city ass in the time-honoured style of Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa and, more recently, Blackburn Rovers. Provincial clubs, previously languishing, who pop up to win their national title. Deportivo deserve even more credit because they have done it in the ultra-modern era of huge TV deals, concentrating cash among the well-heeled elite. These days Barca and Real Madrid constantly check over their shoulders. Irureta, a disciplinarian, is true to his 4-2-3-1 style and requires players to fit this formation, never vice-versa. Not all approve - Eighties Liverpool star Michael Robinson's Monday night TV show in Spain recently screened footage of two Deportivo squad players ripping into their coach on the bench - but he gets results. Donato is flanked at centre-back by the Moroccan Nourredine Naybet, shielded by the two midfield anchors, Mauro Silva, a World Cup winner, and Bryan Robson's Brazilian pal Emerson. They supply a trio of attacking schemers, one of whom is the outrageously gifted Djalminha, who, on his day, is worth the admission price alone. But they are vulnerable in the air at the back. Goalkeeper Paco Molina flaps when he ventures for a cross and Irureta could opt to bring Helder - loaned to Newcastle last season - into the heart of the defence and move Donato into a holding role in midfield. But Molina is convinced his side will prevail. 'It's the most important game in Depor's history,' he says, '_until the next round.' Emerson, who had a passing acquaintance with the Premiership, agrees. 'Depor are favourites,' he declared. 'There's no need to worry. We'll show we're better and that the league in Spain is superior.' Such talk will not faze Leeds - words don't impress O'Leary or his players. Midfielder Olivier Dacourt was asked: can Leeds win the Champions League? He said: 'Why not? We have beaten some good teams. But it will be presumptuous of us to say we will win the Champions League. 'The Anderlecht manager said we were the worst team they had played. Maybe he can watch us in the quarter-final on television! We don't care what people say about us. All that matters is getting a result. Deportivo are a good team. You don't get to the quarter-final on luck, you get there with quality. When we conceded four goals at the Nou Camp against Barcelona everyone said Leeds were finished. But we learned a lot from that experience and that has helped us this season.' O'Leary, a master at talking down his own young team's chances, is hardly going to change his approach now. He said: 'It has been a fantastic adventure. We've beaten the Italian champions, we've played the champions of Europe and now we have to take on the Spanish champions. No one expected us to get past the first group, then no one expected us to reach the quarter-finals. If we get through it will be beyond belief.' \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
