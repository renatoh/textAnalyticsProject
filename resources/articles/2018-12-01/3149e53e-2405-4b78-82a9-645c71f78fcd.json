Khashoggi, a journalist and critic of the Saudi regime, was a Saudi national resident in the US who wrote for the Washington Post. He was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. His body is believed to have been dismembered. Citing the importance of the Saudis as allies, and standing contrary to the conclusions of the CIA, Donald Trump and his aides have steadfastly refused to say Prince Mohammed was responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death. The White House has levied sanctions against 17 Saudi individuals deemed to have been involved. Prince Mohammed is the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. Its government has given contradictory explanations for the death and denied the prince knew of it. Rubio, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, spoke to CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday. He said: \u201cThe bottom line is that there is no way that 17 people close to [Prince Mohammed] got a charter plane, flew to a third country, went into a consulate, killed and chopped up a man and flew back, and he didn\u2019t know about it, much less order it.\u201d He added: \u201c[Saudi Arabia] is not a de-centralised country. That in a country like that, a man with his power, his influence and his control did not know it and did not order, it\u2019s just not believable.\u201d Rubio backed a Senate resolution on the matter that was introduced on Wednesday. The other Republican sponsors were Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Todd Young of Indiana. The Democrats were Dianne Feinstein of California, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Chris Coons of Delaware. The resolution says Prince Mohammed is \u201ccomplicit\u201d in and should be \u201cheld accountable\u201d for the \u201cabhorrent and unjustified murder\u201d. It also says the prince has contributed to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, the blockade of Qatar and the \u201cjailing and torture of dissidents and activists\u201d. On Saturday, a sweeping New York Times report said Kushner, senior adviser to his father-in-law, the president, had become \u201cthe prince\u2019s most important defender inside the White House\u201d. The administration has acknowledged one call between the two men since Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, on 9 October and joined by national security adviser John Bolton. Citing \u201cAmerican officials and a Saudi briefed on their conversations\u201d, the Times said Kushner and Prince Mohammed have \u201ccontinued to chat informally\u201d. Citing the unnamed Saudi source, the paper said, \u201cKushner has offered the crown prince advice about how to weather the storm, urging him to resolve his conflicts around the region and avoid further embarrassments\u201d. Rubio was asked if such White House behaviour constituted a defence of American values. He said he couldn\u2019t say if the Times story was accurate, but added: \u201cThis story is as much about America as it is about Khashoggi. Obviously what happened to that man was terrible, but it\u2019s also about who we are as a nation. \u201cThis is a crown prince that is a reckless individual,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to continue to test the boundaries of what he can get away with internationally and within our alliance, until those boundaries are set.\u201d He added: \u201cAs a nation we cannot say that if our allies do something horrifying, we\u2019re going to look away.\u201d In an interview with the Atlantic published on Friday, the outgoing United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley said the US would not give the Saudis \u201ca pass\u201d and said that as Prince Mohammed\u2019s \u201cgovernment did this \u2026 so he technically is responsible\u201d. She added that \u201cthe administration needs to decide\u201d what steps it will take. On Sunday, Rubio was asked if he thought Haley\u2019s nominated replacement, former Fox News host and state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, was qualified for such a senior job. He told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation he thought \u201cshe has the ability to do the job well\u201d. But he added: \u201cDoes she have detailed knowledge of foreign policy to a level that will allow her to be successful at the United Nations? I don\u2019t know.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
