The Bulgarian Football Union was ordered to stage its next home match, against the Czech Republic, behind closed doors and fined \u20ac75,000 after the incidents during England\u2019s qualifier last month that left play halted twice because of racism from home supporters during the first half. Southgate, asked whether his players had been let down by Uefa\u2019s punishment, said: \u201cIt depends on what we view as being enough. In some respects, if we had thrown Bulgaria out of the competition, that would\u2019ve been easy as well because they\u2019re out [not going to qualify]; OK, they might have a play-off opportunity. \u201cIn my head I\u2019ve got their captain [Ivelin Popov], who probably was as brave as anyone on the field that night, frankly, to go over to your own fans when you\u2019re getting thrashed and to try to affect it in the way he did; I thought was a hugely commendable act. So, would I want to see him as an individual punished? Certainly not, and there were loads of kids in the stadium who were desperate for pictures with our players. So we made friends there. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that we look at Bulgaria and think everything there was wrong. There were clearly people in the ground that have no place \u2013 as far as we\u2019re concerned, as football people \u2013 in football. \u201cBut those people exist in our stadiums as well and we\u2019re maybe better equipped at stopping them coming into the stadiums and that\u2019s something that, in some countries, they\u2019re going to have to get better at. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to continue the sanctions. I think the sanctions are going to have to get higher and higher, but I couldn\u2019t honestly tell you what the right answer for that would be.\u201d England\u2019s players decided against walking off in Sofia in order to comply with Uefa\u2019s anti-racism protocols, and Southgate again commended the way they handled such an unpleasant experience. But, after Brescia\u2019s Mario Balotelli threatened to leave the pitch after being targeted with racist abuse by Verona fans in Serie A last weekend, England\u2019s manager said that Uefa must be prepared for more players to take similar action. \u201cI think what is important is that we highlighted the process, which other clubs that have gone into Europe in the last couple of weeks I think are now more conscious of, because I think for everybody it wasn\u2019t so clear for all that night,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThere is going to be a point actually where that will have to be reviewed because we went to a point and I think if that happens a few times, people are going to say: \u2018Well, hang on a minute! What\u2019s the \u2026?\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s far from ideal for everybody. We should be trying to affect as much as we can it happening at all. Then we wouldn\u2019t be talking about the sanctions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
