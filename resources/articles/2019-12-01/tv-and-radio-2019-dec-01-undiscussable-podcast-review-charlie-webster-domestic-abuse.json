She\u2019s run loads of marathons \u2013 more than 10, a sort of madness \u2013 for various charities, including the Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK and Women\u2019s Aid. She has ridden three stages of the Tour de France, raising money for disadvantaged young people, and, in 2016, did a six-week, 3,000-mile cycle ride from the London Olympic Stadium to Rio de Janeiro to raise funds for the Jane Tomlinson Appeal. While in Rio, she came down with a rare strain of malaria and was given 24 hours to live. She lived. Almost immediately, she joined up with charities that work to eradicate malaria, launching a Mass Action Against Malaria initiative in Uganda in 2018 and giving a keynote parliamentary speech. And now she\u2019s made a podcast, Undiscussable. It is not at all what you might expect from her CV, though her charity work gives a hint. Webster\u2019s life has not always been easy, especially when she was younger, and much of her adult life has been spent rushing around trying to find solutions to what has hurt her, so that others don\u2019t suffer. She is that most marvellous thing, a proper, driven do-gooder. So, Undiscussable. This is a podcast about domestic abuse and what we might do in the UK to help solve it. With my critic\u2019s hat on, I can tell you that, structurally and editorially, Undiscussable is a bit of a mess. Webster hops about, both physically \u2013 one minute she\u2019s at a women\u2019s refuge, the next she\u2019s at a meeting at 10 Downing Street \u2013 and mentally. She\u2019ll make a point about how much money domestic abuse costs the world; then wonder why we concentrate on women being abused, and not men; and follow that with a quick mention of the domestic abuse bill (currently making very slow progress through its various stages). All this without really explaining what she\u2019s up to, or why. In terms of storytelling \u2013 a clear, narrative through-line \u2013 this podcast is all over the shop. But, crikey, Webster utterly makes up for this with her energy and, even more, her empathy. She listens, she understands, she gives people the time to tell their stories. She talks to experts, to survivors, to people working on the frontline; she gets upset, she gets cross, she cries. I cried, too, on several occasions. And in episode five, Fighting Your Past, Webster explains why she is so moved to try and solve domestic abuse. She reads out an essay she wrote when she was a teenager, entitled Notes on Life: \u201cI remember the time when I looked into those psychotic eyes as he charged down the corridor, clearly coming for me. His teeth were gritted so hard\u2026 His intimidating size made me shrink down into a corner, my whole body began to shake violently and my stomach hurt so much.\u201d Surely, you think, a teacher would read this and immediately contact social services. But nobody did a thing. Still, she got an A* for the essay. Webster talks to her mum about their shared past with Webster\u2019s stepdad. Her mum says, \u201cI was trying to create the love that I wanted, and the family that I wanted, by creating this look on the outside, saying, this is what I want. I used to think it would change.\u201d Webster\u2019s stepfather and her mother were together for 29 years. She left with two Lidl bags of belongings and \u00a360. In the midst of all of this, Webster is big enough to make the point that perpetrators of domestic and sexual abuse are usually victims themselves. Their abusive actions were learned when young from those older than them. Webster has particular empathy for teenage boys, who are often blamed as evil, when they simply haven\u2019t been taught how to have healthy relationships. And in episode four, she meets Zac. Zac works with boys that display harmful behaviours, helping them unlearn dangerous sexist assumptions. \u201cWhen that young person was 11,\u201d he says, \u201cwe were fine with them saying: \u2018Oh, girls have to do this, if you ask a girl for sex you should get sex.\u2019 We thought that was just lad banter. But then when they commit a rape five years later\u2026\u201d Zac gets a lot of school referrals. He has funding to work in just two London boroughs, Brent and Croydon. God, Undiscussable is compelling, essential listening. Yes, it has its flaws. Yes, like its creator, it tries to do too much. But, you know what? At least it\u2019s trying. Three interesting business podcasts Music Made Me Do It A new podcast from Loud and Quiet magazine, this interviews people who\u2019ve started businesses in the music industry. Stuart Stubbs presents, and the first show is with Paul Epworth (producer of Adele, Paul McCartney and loads of others). Epworth talks (a lot) about his career, chosen because, as a musician, he \u201cwasn\u2019t particularly good\u201d, so thought he would learn how to make his music sound better: \u201cI honed my talent as somebody who was able to polish a turd\u201d. Future episodes promise Martin Mills, founder of Beggars Banquet, and PR extraordinaire Barbara Charone. How Do You Do? Another new podcast explaining the baffling world of the creative industries. Presented by Hattie Moir and Florence Bass, this show is brought together by Random House, DK Books, BMG and Freemantle, and so features book, music and TV types. Some sharper editing and better music is needed, but the first show, with Tim Fairclough, telly researcher, is interesting, especially if you\u2019ve never understood quite what that title means. Good people coming up include James Cooper from My Dad Wrote a Porno, as well as Emma Wallace, who works as senior audience and brand manager for Stormzy\u2019s Merky Books. Secret Leaders This British podcast recently knocked the biggest (business) podcast out there \u2013 The Tim Ferriss Show \u2013 off Apple\u2019s top podcast slot. Presented by the amiable Dan Murray and Rich Martell, each show kicks off with some slightly redundant either/or questions, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Now in its fourth season, it\u2019s had some great guests, including Martha Lane Fox, Jo Malone and many more. The interviews are relaxed and insightful, the show is well edited and the guests open up. Recommended."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
