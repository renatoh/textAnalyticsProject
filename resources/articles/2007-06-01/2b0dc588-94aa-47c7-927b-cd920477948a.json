The Auxerre vice-chairman Gerard Bourgoin said: \"The discussions are very serious with Tottenham but there are still a number of details to finalise. But we can remain optimistic about the end of the negotiations.\" Yassin Moutaouakil, the France Under- 21 captain, has become Charlton Athletic's fourth summer signing. The 20-year-old right-back, who was reportedly a target for Aston Villa, Everton, Celtic and Lazio, cost the Addicks \u00a3400,000 from the French second division side Chateauroux and has signed a four-year deal at The Valley. \"I'm delighted to sign Yassin and we have very high hopes for him,\" said the Charlton manager, Alan Pardew. \"He's a player who a number of clubs were very interested in, and we're naturally very pleased he has chosen Charlton. Moutaouakil follows strikers Luke Varney and Chris Iwelumo, and centre-half Patrick McCarthy, in joining Pardew's newlook Addicks side ahead of their assault on the Championship next season. The Wigan Athletic goalkeeper Mike Pollitt has signed a new contract with the club, keeping him at the JJB Stadium for another season. The 35-year-old has made 35 appearances since arriving from Rotherham in 2005. Billy Sharp, the Scunthorpe United striker, was yesterday involved in talks with Norwich City over a potential \u00a32m transfer. The 21-year-old was the leading scorer in League One last season with 30 goals as United won the title. \"Norwich have had a \u00a32m bid on the table for some time - and want to be sure that Billy wants to join them before pursuing their interest further,\" said the Scunthorpe chairman Steve Wharton . \"They have offered \u00a32m but they know we are looking for add-ons to that which could take the price to near the \u00a33m mark if they are promoted to the Premiership.\" Wharton also revealed two other Championship clubs were trailing Sharp. \"We have had increased bids from both Wolves and Sheffi eld Wednesday but neither of those come anywhere near what Norwich have off ered,\" he said. Aston Villa's Patrick Berger is a target for Oldham Athletic. The League One team, who have already signed the striker Lee Hughes, want to bring in the Czech Republic international on loan. Last season he spent a spell on loan at Stoke City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
