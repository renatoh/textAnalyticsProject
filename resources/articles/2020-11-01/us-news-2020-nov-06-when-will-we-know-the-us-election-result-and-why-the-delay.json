It could take days, weeks or even months, depending on what happens. What usually happens? US presidential elections are not won by the national popular vote. The winner in each state collects its electoral college votes \u2013 and needs a total of 270 to take the White House. In most elections the result is clear \u2013 although not officially confirmed \u2013 by the end of the night. Major American media outlets \u201ccall\u201d each state for one of the candidates. While not based on the final vote count, that projection is almost invariably accurate. This means an accurate tally of electoral college votes can be made and a winner declared. In 2016, that happened at 2.30am in Washington when Trump reached the required 270. Why is that not happening this time? Mainly because of the Covid-19 pandemic, large numbers of voters \u2013 about 68% of the total, compared with 34% in 2016 \u2013 cast their ballots early, including by post. Counting postal votes is slower because voter and witness signatures and addresses must be checked, and ballots smoothed out before being fed into counting machines. Some states start that verification process long before election day, meaning the count itself can get under way as soon as polls close. There was no early processing in multiple key battleground states this year, however, because Republican-led state legislatures refused urgent requests from local elections officials to pass new laws to allow extra time for ballot processing. Such a refusal in Pennsylvania produced enormous backlogs in cities such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, which has gone from counting about 6,000 mail-in ballots in 2016 to more than 350,000 this year. Which states are we talking about? Five states have yet to be called: Alaska, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Several news organizations, including the Associated Press and Fox News\u2019 decision desk, have called Arizona for Joe Biden. The Trump campaign is arguing, however, that call was made too early. Alaska will end up in the Republican column with near certainty. The race is extremely tight in Georgia, where a recount has been announced by its secretary of state. Biden pulled ahead of Trump by 1,097 votes on Friday morning, with 99% of votes reported. The Democratic challenger is ahead in Nevada, with only Democratic-leaning late postal ballots left to tally. But by state law, ballots postmarked on election day can be counted as long as they are received by 5pm on 10 November, which means counting in the state could continue through the weekend. In North Carolina, while Trump is the clear favourite, the state accepts postal ballots until 12 November \u2013 although that is expected to make little difference. State officials have said a full result would not be known until next week. Biden took the lead in Pennsylvania on Friday morning. He\u2019s been winning the mail-in ballot counts by huge margins, and could very well take the state. Pennsylvania officials had expected to count most votes by the end of Friday, but the process was continuing into Saturday with Biden\u2019s lead widening. What else is complicating matters? Roughly half of all states will accept postal votes that arrive after election day as long as they carry a postmark of no later than 3 November, so postal delays may mean some ballots are not processed until days later: Pennsylvania has said results will not be considered complete until the deadline of Friday. There has also reportedly been an increase in the number of provisional ballots cast by people who asked for a postal vote but then decided to go to the polling station in person instead. These need careful checking to make sure no one has voted twice. The really big unknown: a disputed result In the 2000 race, the Democratic candidate, Al Gore, famously lost Florida by just more than 500 votes out of a total of nearly 6m, costing him the election. After a disputed recount and a supreme court ruling, George W Bush was declared the winner. More than 300 lawsuits have already been filed over alleged breaches of electoral law in the 2020 election, according to reports, and more can be expected over accusations of postal voting irregularities and changes to voting rules due to the pandemic. Trump and his campaign have this week already sued to halt vote-counting in Pennsylvania and Georgia (which have not yet been called by Associated Press) and Michigan, which the AP called for Biden. Judges in Georgia and Michigan quickly dismissed the campaign\u2019s lawsuits on Thursday. Trump\u2019s campaign has also requested a recount in Wisconsin, which AP called for Biden. There is no evidence the campaign\u2019s legal challenges will have a bearing on the election result under the law."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
