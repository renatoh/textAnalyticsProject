This is the first time data for the most borrowed ebooks has been released, with Honeyman\u2019s story of a woman whose carefully timetabled life is shattered by an act of kindness, topping the chart. Honeyman said she was \u201cabsolutely delighted and very grateful\u201d at the news. \u201cOur fantastic public libraries are a precious resource, and provide a vitally important range of services to the community,\u201d she said. The new figures cover the period between July 2018 and June 2019, and coincide with an estimated 358% surge in ebook borrowing during the first three weeks of lockdown in England. Eight of the books in the print top 10 are thrillers, with US thriller author James Patterson securing the crown as the most borrowed print author from UK libraries for the 13th year running, and Lee Child\u2019s Jack Reacher novel The Midnight Line the single most borrowed book. The top 10 most borrowed ebooks, by contrast, include Adam Kay\u2019s This Is Going to Hurt, his memoir about life as a junior doctor in third place, and Madeline Miller\u2019s Circe, a feminist retelling of the Greek mythological witch, in fourth. JoJo Moyes\u2019 Still Me, her second sequel to the bestselling Me Before You, comes in sixth, and Sally Rooney\u2019s Normal People eighth. The ebook chart also included thrillers from Child, Dan Brown, Paula Hawkins and Stuart MacBride. \u201cThe ebook borrowing charts reveal a slightly different reading demographic,\u201d said Julia Eccleshare of the Public Lending Right (PLR) scheme, which pays royalties on each loan. \u201cThe addition of ebooks reflects new users coming to public libraries, who might be less likely to get to a library in a working day.\u201d The PLR, which is now administered from the British Library, means authors are paid around 8.5p each time one of their books is borrowed, to a maximum of \u00a36,600. After a lengthy campaign by authors, ebooks were included in the scheme for the first time in July 2018. \u201cIf PLR is to stay the same \u2013 to paraphrase Lampedusa\u2019s famous quip \u2013 then it has to change,\u201d said the author Tom Holland, chair of the PLR advisory committee, adding that the addition of ebook payments showed that the \u201cPLR is swimming with the fast moving currents of the times\u201d.\ufeff"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
