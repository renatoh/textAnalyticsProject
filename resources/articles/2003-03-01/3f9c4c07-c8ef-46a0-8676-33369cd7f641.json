The conference followed a hastily-arranged mini-summit between the three nations' foreign ministers in Paris. \"Russia and France, as permanent members of the security council, will assume their full responsibilities on this point,\" he added. When asked whether France would use its veto, as Russia has suggested it may do, Mr de Villepin said: \"We will take all our responsibilities. We are in total agreement with the Russians.\" Yesterday, the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, suggested that Russia could veto a new US-backed resolution seen as paving the way to war in Iraq. Mr Ivanov also said that his country was unlikely to abstain in any security council vote on Iraq. \"Russia will not support any decision that would directly or indirectly open the way to war with Iraq,\" he said. Britain, the US and Spain have proposed a draft resolution that says the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, has missed his final opportunity to disarm. The US and Britain claim that Iraq has refused to destroy its chemical and biological weapons, as ordered by the UN, and military action will probably be necessary to disarm President Saddam Hussein. Other security council members, led by France, argue that UN weapons inspections are working, and want the inspectors to be given more time to hunt for banned chemical and biological arms, as set out in UN resolution 1441. \"We see there is progress,\" German foreign minister Joschka Fischer said. \"I do not see personally how we can stop the process of resolution 1441 and resort to war.\" Mr de Villepin said that he believes the results of inspections \"are more and more encouraging,\" citing the destruction of Iraqi missiles, information about biological and chemical agents and interviews with scientists. But he also said Iraq needs to cooperate \"more actively\" with inspectors. \"The inspections cannot go on forever,\" he said. Mr de Villepin set out a framework for giving inspectors more power, including detailed measures to determine whether or not the inspection process is making progress. He added that he believes a war in Iraq would increase tensions in the Middle East, create instability and increase the risk of terrorist attacks. Mr Ivanov said that China, which also possesses a UN security council veto, was in agreement with France, Russia and Germany. Blair: we will press on with new resolution The prime minister, Tony Blair, today warned Saddam that he was facing a final chance to disarm or to leave his country if he wanted to avoid war. Mr Blair confirmed that Britain and the US intend to press their draft resolution, giving the green light to military action, to a vote in the security council next week. \"To people who say we are hellbent on conflict, we still say today it can be avoided if he does what the United Nations and the international community demands he do,\" he told MPs at prime minister's questions. He confirmed that Britain and the US would press the resolution to a vote if the chief UN weapons inspector, Hans Blix, reported on Friday that Saddam was still failing to comply fully with resolution 1441. \"If he fails fully to comply, there should be a vote in the United Nations, and I very much hope the UN supports the position it set out in resolution which called upon him for full, unconditional and immediate compliance,\" he said. \"It is plain, at the present time, he is not in such compliance.\" Mr Blair had held Downing Street talks with Mr Ivanov before the Russian foreign minister left for the meeting with his French and German counterparts. The prime minister's official spokesman acknowledged differences with the Russians, but said there was still a dialogue on how to proceed. Mr Blair again insisted that he remained confident of getting the nine votes needed from the 15-member council. The foreign minister, Jack Straw, warned yesterday that the international community should be wary of placing the US in a position where it felt isolated and obliged to act alone. Mr Straw spoke out as the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, and defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, used television interviews last night to confirm that Washington did not regard a second resolution as necessary for military action. Powell: war will happen with or without UN Mr Powell will attend the security council session on Friday to hear UN weapons inspectors give their latest reports on Iraqi compliance with UN disarmament requirements, a state department official said today. In an interview on Russian national television late last night, Mr Powell said that the US was prepared to lead a war against Iraq, with or without the consent of the UN. With more than 230,000 US troops in the Persian Gulf and ideal fighting weather conditions disappearing day by day, he told Russia's state-controlled ORT television that Saddam Hussein \"must be disarmed\". \"He will be disarmed: peacefully, hopefully, but if necessary, the United States is prepared to lead a coalition of the willing, a coalition of willing nations, either under UN authority or without UN authority, if that turns out to be the case, in order to disarm this man\". Turkish army chief backs US troops plan In a boost for the US's increasingly pressured war timetable, Turkey's chief of staff, Hilmi Ozkok, today said that the military fully backed government plans to allow US troops into the country. A government motion to allow in 62,000 US troops to form a \"northern front\" for war against Iraq, crucial to US war plans, was controversially rejected by the Turkish parliament this weekend. The defeat followed signs of weak support from the military, which wields considerable influence over MPs, for the deployment. \"The Turkish armed forces' view is the same as the government's and is reflected in the motion our government sent to parliament,\" Mr Ozkok said. \"The war will be short if a second front is opened from the north.\" The government is considering putting a second motion on the troops plan to parliament. Annan urges UN council to unify The UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, has urged the bitterly divided security council to find a compromise on its efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein. Mr Annan, who insists that war must be a last resort, said yesterday that he is \"optimistic\" they can find common ground. Several council members expressed strong doubts, however, partly because the US will not negotiate the substance of its resolution calling for UN backing for military action against Saddam. Blix to report to UN on Friday Many council members are viewing Friday's reports by the chief weapons inspectors, Hans Blix, and Mohamed El Baradei, as crucial in their decisions over Iraq. The inspectors are to report on Iraq's compliance with the UN's November resolution giving it a \"final chance\" to disarm or face \"consequences\". They are expected to report Iraqi progress in destroying its illegal Samoud 2 missiles. Mr Powell said yesterday that the US would make a decision early next week \"depending on what we heard, on when we want to bring the resolution to a vote\". He predicted \"a difficult vote\". Meanwhile, UN weapons inspectors today returned to sites around Baghdad where they have been destroying the banned Samoud 2 missiles and casting chambers. Faced with the massive US military buildup in the region, Iraq met the March 1 deadline to start scrapping the Samoud 2 missiles after Mr Blix said that they exceeded the 150km range allowed under UN resolutions adopted after Iraq's defeat in the 1991 Gulf war. The US has dismissed the missile destruction as an Iraqi deception, and continued to increase its military force in the region. US man arrested after wearing peace T-shirt A man was charged with trespassing in a mall in Albany, USA, after he refused to take off a T-shirt saying \"Peace on Earth\" and \"Give peace a chance\". Mall security staff approached Stephen Downs, 61, and his 31-year-old son, Roger, on Monday night after they were spotted wearing the T-shirts at Crossgates Mall. The two said they refused a request to remove the shirts or leave the mall. The guards returned with a police officer, who repeated the ultimatum and arrested Stephen Downs when he refused. Stephen Downs has pleaded innocent to the charges. The New York Civil Liberties Union said it would help with his case if asked. Police said they were responding to a complaint by mall security. Pope leads prayers for peace Pope John Paul II today urged the world's 1 billion Catholics to join him in Ash Wednesday fasting and prayers for peace. The pontiff, a staunch opponent of war in Iraq, said that everyone must \"assume their responsibilities and make common efforts to spare humanity another dramatic conflict\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
