It informed all she did - in her work as a doctor, and in her tireless campaigning for freedom and justice. A child of Jewish communists, Dawn was born in South Africa; her grandparents had fled the tsarist pogroms in the Baltics. As a result of their opposition to apartheid, her mother lost her teaching job and her father was forced into hiding. Dawn grew up linking the oppression against Jews experienced by her grandparents and the racist regime in South Africa. Possibly her mother's early death from breast cancer set Dawn on her medical career, and she graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand in 1974. As a newly qualified doctor, she used her expertise to help those most in need, trying to provide black patients in Soweto with the same standard of care as whites, a course of action that challenged the apartheid rules. Her association with black nurses brought warnings from the authorities. Shortly after Steve Biko was murdered in 1977, it became too dangerous for Dawn to remain in South Africa, so she decided to work and study public health in Israel. She left after four years, disillusioned by the oppression of the Palestinians. Inspired by Dylan Thomas, and a radical doctors' practice in Glyncorrwg, Dawn visited Wales and became involved in international feminism, Cardiff Women's Aid and the Women's Centre. She was on a voyage of discovery when she met Sheryl, the love of her life. She moved permanently to Wales to be with Sheryl, and co-parented Sheryl's two teenage daughters. Dawn worked as a community paediatrician in clinics around Cardiff for refugee and asylum seekers' children. She threw herself into campaigns for peace, women's rights and health, and, alongside Sheryl, became a pillar of Cardiff's lesbian community. The way she celebrated her Judaism with woman-centred rituals, recipes and music was an inspiration. She was a true internationalist, and was proud to finally vote for a democratic government in South Africa in 1994. It was fitting that Dawn and Sheryl became the first civil partners in the country at a ceremony in Holme Towers hospice, Penarth, on the day before she died. She will be remembered for her courage, and strength in adversity, by friends, family and Sheryl, her partner of 24 years. \u00b7 Has someone you know died since December who should feature in Other lives?
