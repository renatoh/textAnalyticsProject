Soderling is the man who helped change Federer's life by removing Rafael Nadal from his path at Roland Garros, assisted Federer to three lifetime goals in one and announced to the world after losing the final that the Swiss is undoubtedly the greatest player ever. Not only did Soderling's efforts help snuff out Federer's growing worries about form and fitness, and perhaps even about age, but they made possible the most ecstatic moment of his career. Since then Federer has indeed started to look like the greatest again. The forehand is booming from all over the court, he is serving more consistently and his movement has become fluid and assured. He has also paraded comfortably in some slightly foppish gear, joked with journalists that one of them was trying to con his way into attending his child's imminent birth and lost only one set in three imperious wins. He knows he is odds-on to regain the Wimbledon title. That is the psychology which has followed his becoming French Open champion, and therefore one of only half a dozen men to win all four grand slam titles, and his equalling Pete Sampras' grand slam total, too. That is what Soderling has become associated with and the Swede admitted cheerfully that, \"if I can play well, hopefully I might have a small chance\". That chance hinges on the fact that \"Roger is the best grass-court player of all time and Rafa is the best clay-court player of all time \u2013 and I beat Rafa on clay, so that gives me a little confidence I can beat Roger on grass.\" This was how it used to be for Federer \u2013 opponents more than half beaten even before they went on court. He is getting at least some of that enormous psychological advantage back again. Along with this huge change of fortune, the other big difference in Federer is that he feels fitter than before. He had a gentle dig at reporters a few weeks ago for not saying that his back troubles might have been behind his moderate form earlier this year. Federer had also seemed concerned that, in his 28th year, he might be conceding advantages in stamina to the top younger players. \"I'm old, he's young, you know,\" he rather surprisingly said after losing to Andy Murray in Doha, pointing out that the Scot tended to come on strong in the latter stages of their matches. This slight vulnerability may yet be tested but probably not by Soderling, whose best hope is to attack very hard, which is natural for him, and hope his flat-hitting might knock Federer out of his stride. Something of a mutual admiration society has been developing between them \u2013 aided perhaps by the way Soderling handled the situation when a streaker bothered Federer in Paris \u2013 and the five- times Wimbledon champion has been suggesting that Soderling is developing into a serious contender on grass. \"If you asked me before Paris, I would have said he is definitely more dangerous on grass than on clay,\" Federer said. \"But then you saw all those great matches he played in Paris. \"So he has definitely proved he is a good all-round player. I have not actually thought about the match at all but it will be interesting to see how he enters this match after coping with such a long tournament in Paris and to see how fresh he is.\" Soderling has lost the first set twice here and nearly did it a third time, which may be due to a little weariness, and he is also in new territory, never having reached the fourth round of Wimbledon before. Which means his best bet might be to recall, with a sense of humour, Rod Laver's comments a couple of years ago. \"Roger could win the Grand Slam [four majors in one year] if he keeps playing the way he is,\" the great Australian said. \"And, if he does, it will equate to the two Grand Slams I won because standards are much higher these days.\" Laver added: \"The best way to beat him would be to hit him over the head with a racket.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
