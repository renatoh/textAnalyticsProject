Under such shoots, beaters drive the birds towards the shooters in an organised way. With a four-month season starting from the \u201cglorious 12th\u201d of August, it is a highly managed commercial process. The announcement of the Labour review, made by the shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, notes that grouse moors cover an area equivalent to Greater London. Preparing this land for shooting involves draining and drying the area, which can destroy wildlife and plants, as well as affecting peat moors that would absorb carbon dioxide emissions. The process can involve burning moors, also increasing emissions. The RSPB charity notes that while the grouse industry brings work and livelihoods to some rural communities, it can also involve the illegal culling of mountain hares and birds of prey such as hen harriers. Despite these concerns, Labour said, the 10 largest English grouse moors are paid more than \u00a33m a year in farming subsidies. Hayman said: \u201cThe costs of grouse shooting on our environment and wildlife needs to be properly weighed up against the benefit of land owners profiting from shooting parties. \u201cFor too long the Tories have bent the knee to land owners and it\u2019s our environment and our people who pay the price. \u201cThere are viable alternatives to grouse shooting such as simulated shooting and wildlife tourism. The time has come for a proper review into the practice.\u201d The drying out of grouse moors has also seen concerns about wildfires, which have become increasingly common on UK moorland in recent years. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 August 2019 to correct the name of the RSPB."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
