The 68-year-old hopes to set a world record by sailing more than 27,000 miles single-handedly around the globe and left Hobart, Tasmania, last week after more than four months of delays. But just five days into his quest, Bullimore, who has been nicknamed 'Captain Calamity' by the Australian media, has been hit by a series of problems. On Thursday a huge sail on his 102ft catamaran, Doha 2006, snapped, causing delays as he made emergency repairs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
