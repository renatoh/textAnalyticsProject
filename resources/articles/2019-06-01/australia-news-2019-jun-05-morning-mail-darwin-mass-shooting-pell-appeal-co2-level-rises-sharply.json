He was in hospital under police guard on Tuesday night. The police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, said the alleged gunman was \u201cwell known to police\u201d and confirmed he had been released on parole in January. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to establish the intent and the motivation behind this,\u201d Kershaw told reporters.

Jeremy Corbyn has accused Donald Trump of spreading hatred and and division as he addressed tens of thousands of protesters, massed within shouting distance of Downing Street to demonstrate against the US president\u2019s visit to London. Trump said he had refused to meet the \u201cnegative\u201d Labour leader on the second day of his state visit, during which he has been hosted by the Queen and Theresa May, and has set out his ambitions for a \u201cphenomenal\u201d post-Brexit trade deal with the UK, which he said could include US access to the NHS. Back in the US, it has emerged that the Trump administration twice approved licences for the export of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia after the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

Opinion and analysis \u201cThe police raid on Annika Smethurst shows her surveillance expos\u00e9 hit a nerve,\u201d writes Amy Remeikis. \u201cIt was dismissed as \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201ccompletely false\u201d. But Smethurst\u2019s report suggesting that the nation\u2019s surveillance agency, the Australian Signals Directorate, was seeking to broaden its powers to spy on Australian citizens without their knowledge was immediately referred for police investigation. On Tuesday, 401 days after Smethurst published her report, AFP officers raided her home as she was preparing to go to work, with a warrant to search her home, her phone and her computer.\u201d The at-home genetic testing company 23andMe has teamed up with Airbnb to offer travel itineraries based on your DNA. \u201cBased on my DNA results, for example, 23andMe suggested I try falconry in the United Arab Emirates or a traditional Irish music pub crawl,\u201d writes Arwa Mahdawi. \u201cWeirdly, despite the fact I\u2019m half-Palestinian, it didn\u2019t suggest I try a relaxing stay in one of the illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank listed on Airbnb, or a traditional military checkpoint crawl.\u201d Mahdawi argues that DNA advertising is also helping to bring outdated and unscientific ideas about \u201crace\u201d and genetics to the mainstream.

Thinking time: \u2018I\u2019m going to wear my Eid clothes and try to be happy\u2019 As Muslims around the world celebrate Eid, war-weary citizens in Idlib, Syria, are marking the end of Ramadan under attack from the Assad regime, which continues to bombard the province.

My brothers can\u2019t go out and play. But I\u2019m going to wear my Eid clothes and try to be happy. I don\u2019t have a choice.\u2019\u201d Media roundup The top story in the Australian this morning is the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, demanding that \u201cbanks pass on the full cut in the official interest rate to help drive economic growth\u201d, after ANZ and Westpac decided to cut mortgage rates by fewer basis points than the official rate.
