The idea is simple: take advantage of the freebies. To encourage punters to remain at the tables, most casinos provide free drinks (and occasionally cigarettes) to players. As most games are heavily biased towards the house, they will easily get back the expense of the free beers with a few spins of the wheel or rolls of the dice. But if you play blackjack and know what you are doing (get some tips from one of the many books available), the odds are better than for any other game (nearly evens). With luck you should be able to enjoy the complimentary booze without blowing your kid's college fund. Three tips: choose a table with at least four other players on it (it's sociable and harder for the dealer to win); tip the waitresses (a dollar a time is fine); and above all know your cash limit and stop playing if you lose it. \u00b7 Do you have a tip for fellow travellers?
