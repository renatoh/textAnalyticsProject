Seats for a parallel festival of Italian B-movies are the hottest tickets in Venice, especially among young film buffs keen to see the spaghetti western and erotic Italian comedies that director Quentin Tarantino said were his inspiration. Tarantino presented the 'Italian kings of the Bs' festival, which revives around 20 B-grade movies from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Fashion designer Miuccia Prada will fund restoration of more so-called junk movies over the next four years in a series called 'The Secret History of Italian Film'. Organisers hope the project will salvage scores of little-known films that never made the annals of film history but now, thanks largely to the DVD, have a thriving international audience. The B-movies on show at this year's Venice festival are a mixture of erotic comedies, westerns and war movies, providing viewers with a continuous flow of 'police chases, zombie cannibals, beautiful girls permanently in showers, rampant sideburns and shirt collars no designer today would dare to revive,' according to the Corriere della Sera newspaper. Many of the 1970s films were made on low budgets and in times of politicial tension and censorship as Italy was rocked by terrorism. In Cannibal Holocaust, four American journalists end up on the menu of an Amazonian tribe and The Coup d'Etat gives life to very real fears in 1972 of a political takeover. Others such as The Orgasm are less violent. The festival has been masterminded by a professor of film comedy, Marco Giusti. Giusti is better known in Italy as the mind behind a news comedy television show called Blob, which strings together the day's news and political blunders and has earned a cult following. In Italy, the erotic comedies of the 1970s in particular have always had a select audience. Walter Veltroni, mayor of Rome and former culture minister, has declared his admiration for Edwige Fenech, best known for her part in Renato Malavasi's Ubalda, All Naked And Warm. Tarantino says one of his greatest sources of inspiration was Italian B-movie maker Fernando di Leo, who made and acted in action films like Death Commando and Hired to Kill in the 1960s and 1970s. Tarantino is also reported to have bought the rights to reproduce a B-movie by another of his heroes, Enzo Castellari, with Samuel Jackson and George Clooney tipped to star in the remake of his 1977 Second World War comedy, Inglorious Bastards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
