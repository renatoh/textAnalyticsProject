Acting chief executive Chris Rhodes issued a stark warning to consumers that the cost of mortgages is going to rise \u2013 regardless of any official cuts to the Bank of England base rate \u2013 and that they needed to keep a clean credit record if they wanted to be granted a loan in 2008. The former building society said the credit crunch would cost it an additional \u00a3150m this year \u2013 the cost of paying for a long-term loan to ensure it has funding to the first quarter of 2009. To curb its risk going forward, A&amp;L has decided to be very selective about granting new mortgages and plans to focus on winning new current account customers and commercial banking instead. Rhodes, the finance director who is standing in for the chief executive David Bennett who is ill, said A&amp;L would concentrate on keeping its existing customers during the coming year rather than seek out new customers with market-leading mortgage rates. It has already axed its 125% loan-to-value mortgage and is now restricting any new loans to 90% of the value of the property. Rhodes said the bank has 450,000 mortgage customers and some 100,000 of these have two and three-year mortgage deals which are coming to a close this year. \"We expect net new mortgage lending to be negative this year. We expect to concentrate on customer retention,\" said Rhodes, who hopes to keep around 70,000 of the departing customers. The move is a step change for A&amp;L which is known for its keen-mortgage pricing. Last year it took a 4.4% share of the market with \u00a34.8bn of net mortgage lending or \u00a313bn gross, which gave it a 3.6% share. At its lowest point today, the bank had a market value of just \u00a31.8bn. Often cited as a target for Spanish bank Santander which already owns Abbey, there was speculation that the fall in its price might alert potential predators to consider an approach for the business. The shares, which were trading around 800p a month ago, hit as low as 428p, before recovering to end 36p lower at 492p. The total dividend is increasing by 2% to 55.3p and A&amp;L disappointed investors by warning the total 2008 dividend will be maintained at this level. Rhodes stressed that while the 2007 profits of \u00a3417m had been dented by \u00a3185m of write-downs on its exposure to assets linked to the subprime mortgage crisis in the US, the underlying A&amp;L business was strong. The retail banks' profit rose \u00a317m to \u00a3462m and commercial banking rose \u00a334m to \u00a3150m. However, the treasury business slumped to a \u00a3165m compared with a profit of \u00a345m a year ago. Rhodes said the treasury business \u2013 which in common with other banks was used to make investments with a view to making money would no longer be run to make a profit but merely to bankroll A&amp;L's businesses. Richard Banks, head of the commercial bank, admitted that he \"regretted\" having bought some of the exotic financial instruments \u2013 bought as long ago as 1999 \u2013 which have now caused the writedowns. Rhodes also made it clear that it the bank had not needed to use the Bank of England's emergency funding windows. \"It wasn't an option to take funding from the Bank of England because of the stigma that is attached to it,\" he said Until the credit crunch hit, A&amp;L used to securitise its mortgages \u2013 package them and sell them on \u2013 through a vehicle called Fosse. It has now created two new special purpose vehicles, Bracken and Langton, to give it \"greater funding flexibility\". The two new vehicles hold \u00a317bn of mortgage assets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
