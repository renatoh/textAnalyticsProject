Gerard Butler plays the indomitable Spartan king Leonidas, who with his computer-enhanced men goes to war wearing only swimming trunks, a scarlet cape, a spear and a snarl. The battles and mock-heroic pontificating seem endless. The Front 12.45am, Sky Movies Drama (Martin Ritt, 1976) Ritt, his screenwriter Walter Bernstein and actor Zero Mostel all approached this recreation of the communist witch-hunts with bitter personal experience to call on. Woody Allen, in his first straightish role, sacrifices his personal neuroses for those of a nation; he plays a bookie who leases his name to the work of blacklisted scriptwriters. The satire hangs a little heavy, but it's a fascinating account of dark days. The Hired Hand 1.10am, Film4 (Peter Fonda, 1971) Peter Fonda's directorial debut, handsomely reissued by Film4, drifts along quietly as cowboy Fonda, with pardner Warren Oates in tow, attempts to renew his relationship with his long abandoned wife Verna Bloom: a spare, absorbing portrait of a doomed search for peace in the old west."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
