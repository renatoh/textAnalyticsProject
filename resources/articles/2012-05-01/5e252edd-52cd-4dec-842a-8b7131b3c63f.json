Now Change.org \u2013 the fastest-growing website for social change in the world \u2013 is launching a UK platform. The site, which models itself as the \"YouTube of social action campaigns\", is expanding its reach in the hope that millions more people will be empowered to take on corporations and even governments, said its founder, Ben Rattray. \"We're radically changing the way in which people can influence those in power to deliver social change,\" he said. \"There is a strong tradition of social justice in the UK \u2013 one of the most powerful petitions in history, to end slavery, was started here \u2013 and we strongly feel that the desire to fight for change is not an American, or even western trait, but a human one.\" The website has 14 million users, with two million more joining every month. It reflects a zeitgeist in which desire for change, disenchantment with traditional power structures and new technology is connecting people online like never before, said Rattray. \"At the moment we are at an interesting intersection where people are remarkably frustrated by politics, the economy, the lack of jobs but at the same time mobilised by technology, especially social media, that brings them together. That is the exciting thing.\" A platform where anyone can start a petition before encouraging others to sign up, Change.org currently launches more than 15,000 campaigns a month, and has hosted almost 130,000 petitions since it was launched in 2007. But it was Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin's campaign that propelled the site into the public consciousness. The petition called for the arrest and prosecution of George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer, who, on 26 February shot and killed Tracy Martin's son Trayvon in a suburb of Orlando but was released without being arrested after pleading self-defence. More than 2.2 million people signed the petition, causing nationwide soul-searching in the US, and finally \u2013 two months after the shooting \u2013 Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder. In a note sent via the site, Trayvon's mother wrote: \"More than 2 million people joined our call for Zimmerman's arrest [...] We feel less alone knowing that so many people stood with our family during this impossible time.\" Change.org already has a presence in Britain, with 500,000 UK users and more than 300 petitions started a month but Rattray hopes having a new UK-based team will help people in this country access local campaigns. \"We can have a huge global impact but the essence of Change.org is that we have deep local roots. People can mobilise around issues that were previously ignored and really make their voices heard,\" he said. The site is used for campaigns big and small \u2013 from a skater lobbying to have a park for his sport in Kirklees to a librarian urging Amazon UK to pay more tax. Brie Rogers Lowery, campaigns director for Change.org in the UK, said that in a era where people were increasingly rejecting top-down decision-making, sites such as Change.org put power back in their hands. \"Less than a third of the electorate turned out to vote in the recent local elections. People desperately want their voice heard on issues but no longer trust traditional politics to deliver on them,\" she said. \"Change.org is here in the UK to fill that gap \u2013 giving everyone the chance to build large-scale campaigns on issues they care about and deliver change at both a local and national level.\" Rattray denied that the ease of starting a petition could encourage some \"troublemakers\" and create headaches and expense for authorities. \"This is not direct democracy; it doesn't mean that the people making the decisions have to agree or comply,\" he said. \"But it does mean that instead of ignoring the people their decisions affect, those in power have to respond, and that is very healthy for democracy.\" The website is officially for profit \u2013 receiving payments from organisations such as Amnesty International and the Humane Society to host their petitions \u2013 but Rattray prefers the term \"for benefit\". \"We have the structure of a business but the ethos of a non-profit,\" he said. \"We want to show that it is absolutely possible to build a company that focuses on the social good while still being a viable business. We don't expect every company to do the same, but we want to demonstrate that it is at least possible.\" There have already been successful Change.org campaigns that have gained media attention in the UK: in February the Advertising Standards Authority banned a Ryanair advert featuring a scantily clad female cabin crew member after a petition started by a Ryanair flight attendant attracted 11,000 signatures, while amateur boxer Elizabeth Plank successfully fought boxing authorities' stipulation that female boxers must wear skirts in the ring at the Olympics after garnering 55,000 signatures. As she put it: \"This petition is not about a piece of fabric, it's about athletes ... If there's one lesson I've learned through my experience as a boxer is that when someone throws a punch, curling up in the foetal position is not an option. You stand up and you fight. You don't ask for power, you just take it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
