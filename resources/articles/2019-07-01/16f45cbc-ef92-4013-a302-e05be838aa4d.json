Schauffele, who shot a third-round 69 to move into 18th place on five under, said he was \u201cpissed off\u201d that his name was the only one to have come out after the Open Championship\u2019s governing body tested 30 drivers to ensure their clubheads stayed within the legal limits. Tiger Woods was among those whose driver was tested, though he confirmed that his was deemed legal. \u201cTo make it fair they should test everybody,\u201d said an angry Schauffele. \u201cOther drivers failed. I\u2019ll just say it, I\u2019m pretty sure a TaylorMade driver failed and the Callaway driver failed. This matter should be private. But R&amp;A didn\u2019t do their job in keeping it private. It was just handled unprofessionally. \u201cTo my best belief, I was playing a conforming driver. The R&amp;A pissed me off because they attempted to ruin my image by not keeping this matter private. This is me coming out and treating them the exact way they treated me.\u201d Schauffele was also annoyed that one fellow player called him a cheater after the random test, which measures how springy the driver\u2019s clubface is. \u201cIt is an unsettling topic,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been called a cheater by my fellow opponents. It\u2019s all joking, but when someone yells \u2018cheater\u2019 in front of 200 people, to me it\u2019s not going to go down very well. I\u2019m cool with him, but that\u2019s not something you joke about.\u201d A spokesman for the R&amp;A did not comment directly on Schauffele\u2019s criticisms but added: \u201cWe always listen to feedback from players and have done so in this situation. We will continue to treat this as a private and confidential matter.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
