It was two, for a start. And two like that in a moment like this. Your club \u2013 and it is your club \u2013 is in the bottom three, the abyss opening: a first ever relegation, an end that feels like it really could be The End, changing everything for everyone. A club unlike any other, they\u2019ve sacked their manager mid-season for the first time in over a decade, an interim board applying the clause that allows them to act only when \u201cindispensable\u201d, so bad have things become. The new man, Gaizka Garitano, on a rescue mission like his father before him, has taken charge but time is running out. In the final second of his first game in charge there\u2019s a penalty, which there shouldn\u2019t have been, and it\u2019s all down to you now. Standing alone, you\u2019re approaching your 38th birthday, you haven\u2019t scored all season, you haven\u2019t won since the opening day four months ago, it\u2019s the last kick of the game, and you\u2019re desperate. You can see it in the faces, hear it in the silence. The manager insists you can\u2019t live in fear, but no one can help it. Everyone looks at you, pleading. Some pray. The man before you was a teammate for 10 years and has saved everything. So, what do you do? You dink in a Panenka, of course. Twelve days later, you find yourself on the same spot, still in the relegation zone, still scared, the score 0-0 again. This time you don\u2019t even take a run up: you just sidefoot it in like it was nothing, a five-a-side with your friends. You do if you\u2019re Aritz Aduriz, anyway. And within seconds, it is everywhere. The Athletic Club striker hasn\u2019t always done things the way others do \u2013 this is the man whose goalscoring record improved after his 30th birthday \u2013 and he didn\u2019t do this the way anyone else has done, either. You\u2019ve got to admire his balls. Scorer of the Panenka penalty that gave Athletic a vital last-kick 1-0 victory over Girona the day the former Eibar and Athletic B team coach Garitano took over, on Sunday night Aduriz scored the penalty that put his team 1-0 up against Real Valladolid, lifting them out of the relegation zone. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d said the former Athletic defender Rafael Alkorta. \u201cWhat Adu just did will go around the world.\u201d It might also become the title of a new type of penalty: Panenka, Cruyff-Olsen, Aduriz. Some likened it to Socrates in 1986, more still compared it to Beppe Signori, but this was different. It was not just that Aduriz didn\u2019t take a run-up, it was that he hadn\u2019t even set himself; it wasn\u2019t so much a single step as not really a step at all. He appeared to be marking out his run-up, on the first of a set of paces backwards, still half-leaning, bent forwards from placing the ball, when he suddenly, unexpectedly swung his right leg forwards. Like the player who curls in a free-kick while the keeper is still positioning his wall, he caught Jordi Masip unaware. Masip hadn\u2019t been ready; no one had. Teammates had seen Aduriz do it at Lezama, but none of them had expected him to do it in a game. Around San Mam\u00e9s, there was a moment\u2019s stunned stillness before surprise gave way to celebration, a sense that they had just witnessed something unique. AS described him as \u201ceternal\u201d. \u201cArt\u201d El Correo called it, \u201coriginal, perfect, and minimalist.\u201d He\u2019d displayed the kind of cold blood that even Luca Brasi couldn\u2019t match, they said. El Pa\u00eds likened him to Humphrey Bogart: unmoved, cool, barely a flicker on his face. As everyone went wild, he didn\u2019t run or scream; he just stood with arms out. And then off it went, the footage forwarded to a thousand phones. All over the place, people watched, amazed. But this was not just for fun \u2013 there\u2019s a reason no Spaniard has scored more penalties than Aduriz since he arrived at Athletic in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s a special moment,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly, \u201cyou have to surprise the goalkeeper, which is what I tried, and it worked well.\u201d The rest of it, on the other hand, has not. Indeed 2018 has been the worst year in Athletic\u2019s history, a year in which they have won just seven times. They have collected 38 points from 38 games, figures that tilt a team towards the second division, where they have never been before. The crisis is real and if relegation comes, the consequences will be felt well beyond Bilbao. No club\u2019s departure would mean so much, a defeat for something much bigger than a team. The sense of loss would not be theirs alone. It is a real possibility, too. Last season was Athletic\u2019s second-worst league finish ever and they have since lost Aymeric Laporte and Kepa. They released coach Cuco Ziganda, and won just once under Eduardo Berizzo. They are lacking goals, too. Athletic have three strikers: Aduriz, whose age is perhaps finally catching him; Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda, who plays on despite a chronic knee injury; and I\u00f1aki Williams, who is quick and exciting but not a centre-forward, and who hasn\u2019t scored at San Mam\u00e9s for two years. There are few obvious solutions \u2013 Athletic will not change what most refer to as their Basque-only policy \u2013 although the return of Fernando Llorente looks likely. They need something. This season, their top scorers are Iker Muniain and Williams with four goals each. Athletic have appeared more solid under Garitano and are unbeaten in three games, but that run has seen a win and two draws, secured with just two goals \u2013 both from Aduriz, both penalties. Perfectly executed penalties. Huge penalties, too. Yet not, as huge as they might have been. The first secured a win Athletic needed desperately; the second put them 1-0 up over Valladolid, on course for three massive points on Josu Urrutia\u2019s final game as president. Aduriz\u2019s penalty carried Athletic to 17th, three points ahead of Villarreal. It was set to give them two wins and a draw in three games under Garitano. There was hope at last. But then, in the last minute, the fear gripping them once more, it was taken away. Athletic conceded, Dani Garc\u00eda trying to clear with a backheel, falling off the pitch, playing the entire Valladolid team onside and watching helplessly as \u00d3scar Plano smashed in the equaliser. The scenario had changed; suddenly, it was only Villarreal behind them, and only by a point. Legan\u00e9s drew with Sevilla the next day. Survival slipped further from sight. \u201cThey end 2018 with a knife plunged into their hearts,\u201d said El Correo. \u201cIt all looks black now, but the sun will be out tomorrow,\u201d Garitano said. He might be right but all the same, this hurt. All around San Mam\u00e9s, they slumped, scared. On the pitch, the man who had stood serene in the middle of it all, the man who patented his own penalty, broke. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening,\u201d he muttered, shaking his head. And then Aritz Aduriz looked to the sky and shouted. \u201cBut why?!\u201d Results and talking points: At Butarque, Sevilla were a goal down and a man down after Franco V\u00e1zquez was sent off at half-time. Yet amid the fog, Wissam Ben Yedder sneaked in to head home a last-minute equaliser to give them a 1-1 draw against Legan\u00e9s. Sevilla remain third, three points behind Atl\u00e9tico \u2013 who they play on the first weekend back. As for Legan\u00e9s, who have not been beaten by any of the top three, that\u2019s now six games without losing. It was a weekend of late goals, which started with an 85th-minute equaliser for Girona against Getafe. Sevilla scored on 90.35, Valladolid on 91.39, and Valencia on 93.02, manager Marcelino leading the charge on to the pitch. At 1-1, the tension had been building. The club\u2019s director general had insisted that the manager would \u201ccontinue, and continue, and continue\u201d no matter what the result but failing to beat Huesca would have been hard to bear. Huesca could consider themselves very unlucky, wasting one wonderful opportunity at 1-1 and having two penalty shouts. So, while there was an explosion when the winner went in, players screaming and shouting, the final whistle brought a very different reaction: whistles from the fans and a mass hanky wave. \u201cThey can take it up the arse,\u201d spat Ezequiel Garay as the players embraced in the middle of the pitch. \u201cWe\u2019re out here suffering like dogs,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Luis Gay\u00e1 shouted. And they had too, but they\u2019re up to eighth. Leo Messi and Jordi Alba did Leo Messi and Jordi Alba things. It was raining cats and dogs. Cats and dogs and bears and rabbits and Sponge Bobs and Pok\u00e9mons and dinosaurs and Smurfs and Tellytubbies. At half-time in Betis\u2019s game against Eibar, which they drew 1-1, fans threw thousands of cuddly toys on to the pitch, which were then collected up and taken to children\u2019s centres. Brilliant. As are Betis: 2018 closes with Quique Seti\u00e9n\u2019s side the calendar year\u2019s fourth-best team.
