It is the busiest day in town all year, with up to 20,000 people taking part, a giant free paella in the square and police cordons to seal off the roads for the culmination of Benidorm\u2019s fiesta week, ultimately finishing with what is known locally as Hangover Friday. Away from the seafront, it was a little less raucous at the spa hotel where every England player has his own private garden. Benidorm isn\u2019t the usual place England might select, having initially expected a game in Madrid or Valencia, but the Spanish authorities knew the festival would mean a sellout and the priority for Roy Hodgson was to arrange a game that, for the first time in a long time, would test his team against authentic category-A opponents. These are certainly the occasions when we might learn more about the state of Hodgson\u2019s team than could be picked up from the lopsided evidence of their qualifying group. No other team won all 10 games in qualifying but it has always felt slightly dangerous to read too much into England\u2019s record when the opposition featured home-and-away encounters with San Marino, Lithuania, Estonia and Slovenia. England\u2019s qualification was virtually assured from the day they beat Switzerland away in their first match and, needing stronger opponents, it is easy to understand why the Football Association accepted the invitation to play in Alicante\u2019s 29,500-capacity Estadio Jos\u00e9 Rico P\u00e9rez on Friday. Beyond that, there is France\u2019s visit to Wembley on Tuesday, followed by the trip to Berlin to play Germany in March. The games have been strategically picked on the back of what was, in essence, a bland qualifying programme and the onus is now on England to show they can hold their own against three of the nations who will have aspirations of winning Euro 2016. \u201cWe know it was a good run in qualifying but this is the real challenge now,\u201d Raheem Sterling, preparing to win his 19th cap, said. \u201cWe are going to be playing some of Europe\u2019s best teams and this is where we really get to see where we are in terms of the tournament in the summer. Hopefully we can show what we can really do \u2013 and if we can, it\u2019s a real barometer of where we are.\u201d Sterling, to put it into context, is one of only nine players in Hodgson\u2019s squad to have started 10 or more games for England and, using his own description, \u201cstill only a child\u201d on the international scene. John Stones has played only once at centre-half \u2013 a 6-0 win in San Marino \u2013 and Ross Barkley\u2019s emergence in the last few games has to be measured against the standard of opposition. Hodgson must be tempted to see whether Barkley can excel in the same way against a side of Spain\u2019s refinement and, likewise, he must be looking closely at whether Wayne Rooney can still menace the better teams. Rooney has scored 10 times in 12 internationals since the World Cup but the level of competition has just gone up a couple of notches. Spain may not be as formidable as they were earlier in Vicente del Bosque\u2019s reign, losing friendlies to France, Germany and Holland since the World Cup, but it is a measure of their standing that in their last qualifying match, a 1-0 win in Ukraine, their substitutes included Iker Casillas, Gerard Piqu\u00e9, Sergio Busquets, Pedro, Juan Mata and Santi Cazorla, even though David Silva and Sergio Ramos were missing. England also have a friendly arranged at Wembley \u2013 three days after the game against Germany \u2013 against Holland and, even though the Dutch failed to qualify, Hodgson is mindful that by selecting a high level of opposition there is the risk of quelling England\u2019s momentum, in the way that the back-to-back defeats against Germany and Chile did before the last World Cup. On the flipside, an encouraging result in Alicante would do a lot to massage the team\u2019s self\u2011belief and in Sterling\u2019s case there is the distinct feeling that he can start to flourish again in England\u2019s colours. Sterling reflected here on the move that took him from Liverpool to Manchester City, describing himself as \u201cstubborn\u201d in the face of prolonged criticism, and recalled Hodgson\u2019s advice after supporters of the Merseyside club had booed him in England\u2019s friendly against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. He told me to block it out,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cHe said: \u2018The level of football you are playing now, you will get stuff like that and it\u2019s about how you deal with it.\u2019 He said to look at the players like Stevie [Gerrard] and Wazza [Rooney]. They have been criticised or been in the public eye for the wrong or right reasons, so he just said to block it out and focus on my football, and try to do well for my country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
