Even those who graduated from Oxbridge in 1985 and 1990 earned on average about 16% less than those from professional families. But the type of university graduates attended and the subject they studied also had an impact on their earnings, said a report published by the Council for Industry and Higher Education, which represents business leaders and senior academics. Men with arts degrees were actually earning 4% less on average three years after graduating than someone with just two or more A-levels. The study by Dr Gavan Conlon and Dr Arnaud Chevalier, at the centre for the economics of education at the London School of Economics, found that on average men with degrees in mathematics, engineering, economics and law earned more than 20% more than someone with two or more A-levels three years after leaving university. For women, the benefits of a degree were more dramatic - on average graduates in health, mathematics, architecture, economics and law earned about 40% more than women with two or more A-levels, while those with arts degrees had a more modest 17% earnings premium. A university name carries weight in subsequent earnings. Oxbridge graduates earned about 8% more than graduates from an old university, while those who had attended a newer institution earned about three to 8% less (depending on the year of graduation). \"There are some important messages here for potential students and those who advise them,\" said Richard Brown, chief executive of the council. \"To talk about average 'returns' is to miss the wide variation that exists. \"There are also implications for government policy. Just getting students from poor communities and comprehensive schools into so-called 'top' universities will not ensure that they then get the best jobs. Employers have to play their part in persuading prospective students that it is worth their while to invest in learning. They should consider their recruitment policies; the business benefits of having a diverse labour force that can relate to an equally diverse range of customers; the ethics of discriminating (however unwittingly) against older graduates or those from different social groups. There is a danger that some employers just recruit in their own image.\" \u00b7 The report Financial Returns to Undergraduates: a summary of recent evidence by Dr Gavan Conlon and Dr Arnaud Chevalier at the centre for the economics of education at the LSE is available from CIHE price \u00a35: cihe@btinternet.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
