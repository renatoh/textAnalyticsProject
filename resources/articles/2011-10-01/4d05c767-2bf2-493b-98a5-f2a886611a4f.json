The murder of lawyer Pat Finucane was one of the most controversial killings of the Troubles with allegations that the security forces colluded in the death. Amnesty International also condemned the governments' refusal to hold a fully independent inquiry into the Finucane killing. Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty International's Northern Ireland Programme Director, said: \"That Patrick Finucane's family has been kept in the dark so long is an outrage. That the government has proposed another pointless review of case files, instead of the independent, transparent inquiry they deserve, is a shameful decision, not to mention a dereliction of duty under international law. \"It is to the disgrace of the UK government that, over 20 years on from the murder of Patrick Finucane, the truth about his killing is still being kept from his family and from the public. It is doubly shameful given the profound failures to investigate that were identified by both the Cory Collusion Inquiry and the European Court of Human Rights.\" Up to 28 members of the Ulster Defence Association mainly from the Greater Shankill area who were involved in the 1989 murder plot against the prominent solicitor were revealed later to be working for one or other branch of the security forces at the time. The UDA informers included British Army agent Brian Nelson who provided the intelligence to set up the Finucane murder. Billy Stobie, the UDA so-called quartermaster who provided the weapons used to shoot the lawyer was later revealed as an RUC Special Branch agent. The Finucane family who had met David Cameron in Downing Street expressed their outrage over his offer of a leading barrister to review the case. Geraldine Finucane, Pat Finucane's widow, told reporters outside No 10 today that she felt so angry she could hardly speak. The family called a halt to Tuesday's meeting and said they would continue their campaign for an independent public inquiry and would not participate in the review. The government has asked QC Desmond DeSilva to review the papers in the case. When he was prime minister, Tony Blair agreed to set up an inquiry but a fresh investigation was never established. The family have said they want an inquiry that is public, effective and independent. Before the meeting, the government said they hoped the Finucane family would be satisfied with their response. In 2004, the then Northern Ireland Secretary of State Paul Murphy announced his intention to hold an inquiry under the new Inquiries Act. SDLP justice spokesperson Alban Maginness described the decision as \"unacceptable\" and accused the Prime Minister of raising the family's hopes. \"After all this length of time one would have expected better from the British Government and Prime Minister on an issue that runs deep into the British military and security complex,\" he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
