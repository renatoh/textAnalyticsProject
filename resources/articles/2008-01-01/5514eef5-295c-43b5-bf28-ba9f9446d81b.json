Once they've been read, people just discard them. Annoyed by this unsightly mass of paper, exhibition director Karen Janody had an idea: why not collect them up and reuse them, instead of them just becoming a huge amount of waste? She started building piles of them in her house and thought about using them as small sofas, but soon the mound of paper was just too huge. \"I thought I'd need to build an extra house just for the newspapers,\" she says. It was at that point that her most recent art project was born. Together with conceptual artist Sumer Erek, 48, and a new organisation called Creative City, she will begin building the shell of the Newspaper House on Gillett Square in Hackney, east London, at the end of this month. The public will then be encouraged to collect newspapers they find lying around or have at home and bring them to the location from March 3 to March 9. The artists anticipate that thousands of newspapers will be needed. People will not just be asked to bring the newspapers but also to write a personal message on them and roll them into \"sticks\" to use as building material. \"We don't want to be moralistic, but to raise the awareness for the environment in a more humorous way,\" Janody says. \"The installation forces us to look at our own waste, as individuals and collectively, through both the familiarity of the material and the sheer mass of it.\" Erek wants the installation to be \"a house not in terms of a roof on our heads, but as a metaphor of private home in public space. In a much wider sense, this space is our globe, which we should protect.\" The art project is supported by Hackney council. \"The strong environmental message of the project will engage Hackney's communities in the 'reduce-reuse-recycle' debate,\" says Kim Wright, the council's corporate director of community services. Funding comes from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, which has provided \u00a315,000 to enable the project to take place in two or three other cities this year. \"The Newspaper House is an innovative and involving way of meeting two of our current funding priorities - raising environmental awareness and art in public spaces,\" says the foundation's director, Andrew Barnett. \"We all need to do our bit for the environment and this gives us an opportunity to do so in a way that's close to home.\" newspaperhouse.blogspot.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
