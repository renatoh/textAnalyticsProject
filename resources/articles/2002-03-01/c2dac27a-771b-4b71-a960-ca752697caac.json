The South African president, Thabo Mbeki, the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, and the Australian prime minister, John Howard, met today in London and made the decision on behalf of the 54-member Commonwealth. The move does not amount to a full suspension, but means Zimbabwe will not be allowed to take part in any of the group's meetings for the next year. Speaking in London, Mr Howard announced: \"The committee has decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth for a period of one year with immediate effect. This issue will be revisited in 12 months' time, having regard to progress in Zimbabwe based on the Commonwealth Harare principles and reports from the Commonwealth secretary general.\" Mr Howard said the decision to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth was at the severe end of the range of options open to the organisation. Britain and other industrialised nations have pressed for Zimbabwe's expulsion after the controversial elections resulted in Mr Mugabe being sworn in for another six year term. However, African members have taken a softer approach, and South African election observers had declared that polling in the presidential elections was legitimate. Mr Mbeki's African National Congress and Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party have been allies since the 1960s, when both were fighting white minority regimes. Other election observers said the three days of voting that began on March 9 did not adequately allow voters to freely express their choice. Independent observer groups said the poll was intentionally tilted to ensure Mr Mugabe's re-election. Today's meeting lasted about three hours and Mr Howard said it had taken note of the observer group report, which \"had concluded that the presidential election was marred by a high level of politically motivated violence and that 'the conditions in Zimbabwe did not adequately allowed for a free expression of will by the electors'\". The prime minister, Tony Blair, immediately welcomed the move. \"He clearly welcomes the decision by the Commonwealth troika and believes that it is absolutely the right thing to do,\" his official spokesman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
