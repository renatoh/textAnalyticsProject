No surprise there, to be fair to the lads, given they must have been itching to get away from the stadium and back to the boozer, ready to resume charming the locals with some educational songs about mid-20th century European history. Every minute matters when people are waiting to hear about what did happen to those 10 German bombers in the air, so it was no wonder that some England fans could be heard chanting \u201c[Eff] VAR\u201d when Wilson\u2019s elation at breaking the Swiss resistance proved short-lived. Weirdly VAR remained un-effed, however, and that meant Gareth Southgate\u2019s team had to go through the stress of a penalty shootout in order to win the ultimate gong: third place in the Intertoto Cup (that is what that competition\u2019s called, isn\u2019t it?). Eek! While it was a bit annoying that the earliest pre-season friendly in history had to go on a bit longer than necessary, it\u2019s important to remember that we would have been denied the spectacle of Jordan Pickford, powered by the Vimto running through his veins, traction-engining his penalty into the net if the game had been settled in normal time. It was probably the most thunderous spot-kick since Julian D1cks almost took Peter Schmeichel\u2019s head off at a stadium called Upton Park (look it up, kids) and from that point there was no doubt Pickford would come up with the save that confirmed England are even better at football than Switzerland. Take that, Roger Federer. Bronze, though. Shiny bronze! Look at England, envy of All Europe, ready to conquer all-comers at Euro 2020. Assuming we ignore the fact that it was Portugal, who went and actually won the Nations League, that is, beating the Netherlands thanks to a strike from Valencia forward Gon\u00e7alo Guedes. It was further evidence of Portugal\u2019s tournament prowess, though judging by Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s contained celebrations this paled in comparison to their success at Euro 2016. Nothing to get too excited about, then, unlike England\u2019s finest achievement since winning Le Tournoi in 1997. Speaking of which, there\u2019s another tournament going on in France at the moment \u2013 and, presumably now the Nations League is done, $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver, our stereotypical English cousin, and all the other stag-doers will be heading to Le Havre to back the Lionesses when they face Argentina on Friday.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019m so upset. More for the style in which we played the second half. If you think as a coach you can come in and change your philosophy and change the style within five matches \u2026 we have just been crucified, not once but twice\u201d \u2013 Matildas legend Heather Garriock sticks the flamin\u2019 boot into manager Ante Milicic after his side approached their World Cup opener, a shock 2-1 defeat by Italy, playing a defensive line almost as high as Everest. FIVER LETTERS \u201cIs Gareth Southgate The Fiver? To simultaneously speak of fatigue, presumably from too many matches, and lack of match sharpness, presumably from too few, he shows all the inherent contradictions we expect from our daily tea-timely email. Or maybe he just picked the wrong team\u201d \u2013 James Cahill. \u201cI\u2019m perplexed by the unrealistic expectations placed on the English men\u2019s team by fans and media. In the Nations League, England, stocked (understandably) with Englishmen, and playing a game that their forefathers invented, have once again underwhelmed in a major tournament. Yet only last week we were celebrating the end of an English club season that saw four English teams, stocked mostly with non-Englishmen, contest the two major European club finals. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the Toronto Raptors, a Canadian basketball team, stocked with nary a Canadian but playing a game invented by a Canadian, are one win from being crowned NBA champions, the most important club basketball title in the world. Should Canadian basketball fans now expect Olympic gold medals and world championships from their national hoops team? For what it\u2019s worth, \u2018Basketball\u2019s Coming Home\u2019 is a catchy slogan\u201d \u2013 R Reisman. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 James Cahill. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Tributes continue to be paid to Leyton Orient manager Justin Edinburgh, who died on Saturday aged 49 after suffering a cardiac arrest. \u201cFootball aside, Justin was a hugely positive man, loved his family,\u201d said Jobi McAnuff, Orient\u2019s captain. \u201cEvery day he came in he had that lust for life, a real zest about him, a real willingness to enjoy himself. I think he would want us to carry that on.\u201d Suspended Afghanistan Football Federation president, Keramuudin Karim, has been banned for life from all football-related activity and fined a million Swiss francs by Fifa following an investigation finding him guilty of \u201chaving abused his position and sexually abused various female players, in violation of the Fifa code of ethics\u201d. Steph Houghton reckons other teams should be frightened of England, given they saw off Scotland 2-1 despite being a bit bobbins. \u201cIt\u2019s quite scary that we know we can play quite a bit better,\u201d she roared. Meanwhile, the match was the UK\u2019s most-watched women\u2019s game of all time, drawing a peak of 6.1m viewers. Ryan Giggs wants his Wales players to stay focused amid concerns they may be subjected to abuse in Hungary, where there will be a partial closure of the stadium in Tuesday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier. \u201cFor me it\u2019s all about concentrating on the game,\u201d said Giggs. \u201cWe hope all the fans behave as always.\u201d Fresh and funky Turkish officials have had a pop at Iceland after the national team were kept waiting for three hours at passport control in Reykjavik before Tuesday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier. \u201cThe disrespect shown to our national team is unacceptable and what is necessary will be done,\u201d fumed Ibrahim Kalin, spokesman to president Tayyip Erdogan. \u201cOur national team will give the best response on the field.\u201d Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n shed salty tears of joy after his two goals in the 3-0 gubbing of USA! USA!! USA!!! made him Venezuela\u2019s all-time leading scorer. \u201cAs a kid, I had many dreams,\u201d he sobbed. \u201cI dreamed of playing for Venezuela and, once I achieved that, my goal was to beat Juan Arango\u2019s record.\u201d And Crystal Palace have said \u201cpah!\u201d to Manchester United\u2019s opening offer of 40 million big ones for Aaron Wan-Bissaka. STILL WANT MORE? Hope Solo joins Marta, Zico, Marcel Desailly, Thomas Hitzlsperger and, er, David James on the list of colleagues yet to invite The Fiver out for post-work Tin.
