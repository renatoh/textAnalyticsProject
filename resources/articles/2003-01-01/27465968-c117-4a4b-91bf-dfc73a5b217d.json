The FTSE-100 index closed up 9.2 points at 3,490 in volatile trading after an unprecedented sequence of losses that pushed leading shares to levels not seen since October 1995. Oil stocks such as BP and Shell contributed to more than half of the rise, reflecting higher crude prices after Iraq threatened possible retaliation against Kuwait in the event of a war. Fears of war hung over the market, which has dropped 12% in the last two weeks, holding back investors, who may have wanted to look for bargains. \"I don't think the market is going anywhere until we get a resolution to the Iraq situation. There is a thought that equities are looking on the cheap side but aside from a few small punters, no one actually wants to put money on the table,\" one trader said. European defence giant BAE Systems made the biggest gains, up 11.9% amid reports said it was set to win a \u00a33bn aircraft carrier deal from the UK government. Shares in BAE have struggled recently on worries that Thales, the French defence company, would pip BAe for the contract. But insurance stocks continued to act as a drag on the market, with Britannic slumping 17% to 112p. Falling share prices means the company, which has already scrapped its final dividend and deferred taking a decision on bonus payments to around one 1 million customers, might be forced to stop writing new business. The telecoms sector also suffered after Kingston Communications said a turbulent market would weigh on its full year results. Shares in Kingston fell 14%, while larger rival BT lost 4.9%. In the US, war fears also weighed on Wall Street as nervousness ahead of Mr Bush's speech overshadowed solid outlooks from big companies such as Merck, the drug giant, and a better-than-expected report on consumer confidence. \"Things are just so volatile, because people are so damn nervous,\" Donna Van Vlack, director of trading at Brandywine Asset Management told Reuters.\"I'm just as annoyed with this market as everybody else is.\" Mr Bush is expected to make the case of US military action against Saddam Hussein with or without international support. On the domestic front, he will talk up his $674bn (\u00a3411bn) tax cut plan to help boost economic growth. In lunchtime trading, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrials average rose 32 points, or 0.4%, to 8,022, after climbing more than 1% earlier. The broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 3 points to 850, while the Nasdaq technology market edged up 1 point to 1,326. The Paris bourse ended slightly higher, snapping a seven-session losing streak, led by retailer Pinault-Printemps which rose on reports it was selling more assets to reduce debt. The CAC-40 rose 0.1% to 2,800. UK shares have tumbled over the past two weeks as worries over Iraq, corporate profitability and economic growth hit confidence. The FTSE-100 yesterday fell to its lowest point since the mid-1990s, wiping nearly \u00a330bn from the value of blue-chip shares."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
