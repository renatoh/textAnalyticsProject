This breathless win, their first league victory of 2019, has put the Bears 13 points clear of bottom-placed Newcastle and also sharply improved their prospects of avoiding relegation. There were several moments when Bristol looked quite capable of throwing away one of their best results of the campaign, not least when Gloucester were awarded a late penalty virtually in front of the posts with the hosts leading 25-24. Billy Twelvetrees had previously kicked everything but this time the ball faded wide and an outstanding 79th-minute long-range penalty from Ian Madigan compounded the visitors\u2019 frustration. For Gloucester supporters it was a salutary reminder that nothing in this relentlessly competitive league can be guaranteed. Despite having beaten the top two sides, Exeter and Saracens, in their last two outings they lacked consistent rhythm and duly missed out on the chance to regain third place at the expense of Harlequins. \u201cBristol are not just a side making up the numbers; they\u2019re as good as anyone,\u201d lamented Gloucester\u2019s head coach, Johan Ackermann. It was also a night that underlined just how much the professional game owes to players of Pacific island heritage. Bristol possess more than most and Pat Lam, the Bears\u2019 head coach, rightly described the proposal not to involve Fiji, Samoa and Tonga in a projected new 12-team World League as \u201ca slap in the face\u201d prior to kick-off. Not that the home side needed any extra motivation, having failed to beat the Cherry and Whites in the Premiership since February 2008. Scoring points has not been their problem this season and inside 90 seconds they had registered a fine try, the former Gloucester flanker Dan Thomas finishing off a slick team attack launched by Charles Piutau. There could have been a second following a slicing break through the middle by Harry Thacker but Bristol also retain the ability to keep the opposition interested. There is space out wide against them for anyone clever enough to exploit it and nice passes from Twelvetrees and Danny Cipriani duly put Jason Woodward over unopposed in the right-hand corner. Twelvetrees\u2019 conversion also edged the visitors ahead but Bristol\u2019s energy and ingenuity in attack continued unabated. Their problem is over-enthusiasm, with their ability to retain the ball in their own half not always repaying their ambition. Even so the Bears were still ahead at the interval, with two sure-footed penalties from Callum Sheedy earning them a deserved 11-7 lead. Gloucester also had to overcome the loss of their captain, Willi Heinz, who suffered an early head knock and were suitably grateful for an early second-half penalty from Twelvetrees. Any feelings of relief did not last long, a trademark break from the fit-again Luke Morahan splintering the visiting defence and the excellent Andy Uren touching down at full stretch in the left corner. Madigan, on at half-time for Sheedy, coolly slotted the conversion but Bristol rarely deal in the mundane. First Tom Marshall scored athletically in the right-hand corner before Ollie Thorley, capitalising on a defensive howler close to his own line, put Gloucester back in front. Twelvetrees converted both only for a deliberate knock on by Woodward to leave the Bears with a man advantage. An unstoppable 13-man driven maul duly yielded a penalty try and another yellow for Ed Slater, setting up another of the frantic finales in which this competition specialises. Even in the closing seconds there could still have been a dramatic postscript with Gloucester forcing a close-range attacking lineout but the Bristol pack, still full of energy, killed the drive and secured the priceless West Country spoils. \u201cThe moment you focus on the bottom, you end up at the bottom,\u201d said Lam, hopeful there is even better to come. \u201cWe\u2019re only five points off fifth place.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
