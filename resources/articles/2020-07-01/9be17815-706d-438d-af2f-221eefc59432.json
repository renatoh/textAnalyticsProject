Vanessa Guill\u00e9n, 20, disappeared from the Texas military base on 22 April, prompting a protracted search that ended with the discovery of her remains on 30 June. The army specialist Aaron David Robinson, a suspect under watch, escaped from Fort Hood later that day and died by suicide as law enforcement closed in. His girlfriend, Cecily Aguilar, a civilian, was taken into custody and has been accused of helping Robinson dispose of Guill\u00e9n\u2019s body after he bludgeoned her. Aguilar pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to tamper with evidence and was denied bail earlier this month. \u201cNothing\u2019s ever going to be the same,\u201d Mayra, 22, told the Guardian. \u201cThere is that presence of absence here at home, and especially in my mom\u2019s heart, my dad\u2019s and of course all of my siblings.\u201d Guill\u00e9n\u2019s family has said her sister was being sexually harassed by Robinson, and her death has sparked outcry over rape culture in the military. Veterans and current service members have shared their experiences of sexual violence with the social media hashtag #IAmVanessaGuillen. Her death has resonated deeply with the Latinx community and highlighted the growing Hispanic population in the military, but the issue is not just a Latinx one, said Lupe Guill\u00e9n, Vanessa\u2019s younger sister. \u201cThis could happen to anyone.\u201d In response to growing public pressure, the army announced a raft of investigations examining the failures of multiple military procedures following Guill\u00e9n\u2019s disappearance. But her family is still waiting for a simple demand to be met: a congressional investigation into Fort Hood, which has long been criticized for failing to protect soldiers. The Guill\u00e9n family\u2019s calls have been echoed by more than 4,000 service members and veterans who signed a petition circulated the weekend Guill\u00e9n\u2019s remains were positively identified. \u201cAt this point, I won\u2019t settle for less,\u201d Mayra Guill\u00e9n said. Yet the family has felt sidelined. On 10 July, the army secretary, Ryan McCarthy, announced that he would direct an independent review of the \u201ccommand climate\u201d at Fort Hood after a meeting with the Texas congresswoman Sylvia Garcia and the League of United Latin American Citizens (Lulac). The meeting was capped off with a photo on the steps of the Pentagon posted to McCarthy\u2019s Twitter account, which he captioned with a vow \u201cto listen in order to create enduring change\u201d. The meeting should have marked a turning point as one of the highest-ranking members of the army, Guill\u00e9n\u2019s congressional representative and the nation\u2019s oldest Latinx civil rights organization teamed up to confront the killing of a Mexican American soldier. But no representative for the Guill\u00e9n family was there. \u201cWe\u2019re having a really hard time trying to process everything. I would understand why they would exclude myself, my mom, etc, but not Natalie. I just don\u2019t feel that it was right,\u201d Mayra Guill\u00e9n said, referring to the family\u2019s lawyer, Natalie Khawam. \u201cSo you know, honestly, I feel like they\u2019re following their own agenda. At this point, I don\u2019t know exactly what their goal is,\u201d she added. Khawam says she only learned of the meeting the day it was taking place, when a source in the secretary\u2019s office texted her asking if she would attend. Billed as an opportunity to discuss \u201chow to increase diversity and inclusion in the army\u201d in addition to Guill\u00e9n\u2019s death, the meeting also addressed renaming Fort Hood, in honour of the Texan military hero Roy Benavidez. Using the meeting to discuss the longstanding requests hasn\u2019t sat well with the Guill\u00e9n family. \u201cI think that should be one of the least important factors at the moment with everything going on in the base,\u201d said Mayra. David Cruz, the Lulac communications director, told the Guardian that Khawam and Mayra had been aware of the meeting, but the family had not received information to attend. \u201cEven if they wanted to just discuss [Vanessa] for 10 minutes, somebody from the family or the attorney should have been invited or notified,\u201d Khawam said. Tom Rheinlander, Fort Hood director of public affairs, said: \u201cIt would be inappropriate for Fort Hood officials to comment while there is an ongoing case with the US attorney\u2019s western district office.\u201d The army\u2019s civilian review will appoint an independent panel of civilian consultants, chosen in collaboration with Lulac. The panel will visit Fort Hood for five to 10 days to conduct interviews and will review \u201chistorical data\u201d to assess the base\u2019s culture around sexual harassment and assault. The Guill\u00e9n family remains unimpressed. \u201cI feel anyone can play nice for five to 10 days, and then they\u2019ll just go back to their normal routine. For me, it\u2019s just honestly a waste of time,\u201d said Mayra. \u201cWhat we have been asking for is a congressional investigation. Not a meeting or an independent review by the army,\u201d Khawam added. \u201cThey act like they gave us a gift. It was a Trojan horse.\u201d In addition to the army secretary\u2019s review, three other investigations are under way: one into Guill\u00e9n\u2019s disappearance and death, another into experiences of sexual harassment Guill\u00e9n confided to friends and family, and a third into Fort Hood\u2019s sexual harassment/assault response and prevention program (Sharp). However, all these investigations remain in the hands of the military. The family instead wants to see a congressional investigation that would issue subpoenas to base officials and conduct interviews, including with past victims of sexual misconduct. According to her family, Guill\u00e9n never reported incidents of sexual harassment involving two men, including Robinson, out of fear of retaliation. About one in three service members report sexual assault, according to the Department of Defense. Khawam is also authoring legislation to create an independent agency for service members to report sexual harassment and assault that she will present to lawmakers on 30 July. The family will meet with Donald Trump at the White House the day before. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the whole place gets turned upside down, every person has a voice,\u201d said Khawam, who says she gets emails every day recounting disturbing episodes at Fort Hood dating back years. A letter sent in early July from Congresswoman Garcia\u2019s office with the signatures of 87 lawmakers calling for another investigation by the defense department inspector general received a lukewarm response from the Guill\u00e9n family. But the prospect of a congressional investigation has recently gained momentum, and Khawam spoke with the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, on Sunday. Garcia\u2019s office told the Guardian: \u201cI won\u2019t stop investigating this matter until we get to the bottom of the truth \u2026 As I have assured the family, Congress will continue to move with diligent speed to provide oversight and fully investigate this case.\u201d But trust remains fragile for the Guill\u00e9n family, whose relationship with the military quickly soured when Vanessa disappeared. Mayra says her family wasn\u2019t notified about her sister\u2019s disappearance until they called to inquire after an uncharacteristic period of silence. The sisters had talked every day. When she went to the base the following day, Mayra was greeted by Robinson, alongside other soldiers. She said she \u201cinstantly felt that he had something to do\u201d with her sister\u2019s disappearance, and the feeling intensified as the day went on. She said he burst out laughing as she was filling out missing persons paperwork. The army remained tight-lipped throughout the two-month search, while the Guill\u00e9n family cobbled together details on their own. The family gave Robinson\u2019s name to army authorities multiple times, but investigators didn\u2019t disclose he had been a main suspect until after the day he died. Mayra says the family understands the sensitivities of the investigation, but \u201cI feel if they would have at least told us \u2026 it would have been helpful, in a way, for us to take things in.\u201d Mayra said she appreciated what Garcia and others have said and done over recent months, but she felt there was so much more that could be done to deliver justice for Vanessa. \u201cIf anything did happen inside the base, more than ever, I feel that we need a congressional investigation to figure out who and what exactly, and why. That\u2019s one of my biggest questions \u2013 why would anyone do that to my sister?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
