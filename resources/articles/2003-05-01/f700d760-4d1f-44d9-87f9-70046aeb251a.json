Wogan, who has presented every contest since it began, said a song writer with a proven track record must be brought on board to boost the UK's hopes of success. He was speaking after this year's UK entry, by Liverpool duo Jemini, was humiliated at the competition and failed to win a single point. \"We need someone to write four songs and get them to pick the singer as well, before allowing listeners to Radio 2 or wherever to pick their favourite,\" said Wogan. \"Whoever it is won't lose face if they don't win, and we would certainly secure a higher standard of entry. If we don't go about picking the song the right way, we will never win it.\" The UK's entry is currently chosen by viewers of the Song For Europe contest, which traditionally airs on a Sunday afternoon on BBC1. But Wogan joked the UK would never win the competition because it had \"invaded too many countries\". \"I blame the war on Iraq, but you have to blame somebody,\" he said. \"The UK hasn't got too many friends in Europe. We were never going to get too many points - we never do. The western European countries - France, Germany, the UK - having won the Cold War, lost the Eurovision. \"It is the politically correct countries that get all the votes.\" On his own future, Wogan said he still had two years left on his contract to present Radio 2's breakfast show, which recorded its highest ever audience of 7.9 million listeners at the start of the year. \"The BBC could get fed up with me, or I might get fed up doing it,\" he said. \"But the reason I have kept getting up at half past five is I love doing radio.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
