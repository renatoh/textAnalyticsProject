Avoriaz, a lightly-raced four-year-old with an intriguing background, can come up trumps for the Malton trainer, who won this valuable handicap five years ago with Vintage Premium. Avoriaz (3.15) started life in France, where he had form behind the subsequent Derby fifth Visindar last year, before joining Luca Cumani. The grey was unable to win either of his two outings for the Newmarket trainer, but was quickly off the mark for Fahey at Ayr. That was an ordinary handicap, but Avoriaz, a best-priced 12-1 today, won in eye-catching style. He remains unexposed and could be well in despite a penalty. The distance of the Ayr race was the same as today's, which has been shortened to nine furlongs owing to York's ground problems. This will surely count against Hitchcock who, like the winner, seemed to need all of a mile and a half when a close third to Pevensey at Royal Ascot. Greek Well is turning out to be a progressive handicapper. He is out to end a dismal run for trainer Sir Michael Stoute in this race - six beaten favourites since he last won it with Icona 18 years ago. York 2.10 Although he only won by half a length last week at Beverley, The Grey Berry looked to have any amount in hand. He is one to follow. Chester 2.25 Godolphin recently brought Winged Cupid back to score after a lengthy absence, and if Opera Cape is anywhere near straight today this former smart juvenile can follow suit. York 2.40 Little has gone right for Prince Namid in sprint handicaps of late, but with the ground in his favour and cheekpieces fitted, he is worth another chance. Ascot 2.50 Though unable to get competitive in the Queen Anne Stakes, Cesare was not beaten far in fifth and had Racinger (now 3lb worse) behind him. Highly impressive when beating Dunelight here previously, he sets the standard. Chester 3.35 Winner of this race for the past two years, Tournedos looks to have been teed up for the hat-trick bid by sprint specialist Dandy Nicholls. York 3.50 Tagula Sunrise, who is reported to be in foal, can prove the pickhere. She will have come on for her recent run, and is close to her last winning mark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
