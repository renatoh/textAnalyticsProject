Calderwood, who saw a 2-4-4 formation at Hearts last week end in a 7-1 defeat, tinkered in the knowledge that these two meet again on Wednesday in a Tennents Scottish Cup replay. This win maintains Celtic's 13-point lead over second-placed Rangers in the SPL. The first goal was struck by Stilian Petrov following a diagonal pass from Henrik Larsson in the 11th minute. Two minutes later Chris Sutton exited with damaged shoulder ligaments, but Celtic's dominance continued as Larsson curled a free-kick into the top corner for his 32nd league goal of the season. Dunfermline ran risks at the back yet no one was prepared to make the adventurous movements from midfield that were Celtic's stock in trade. However, they caused a minimal shift in the balance of play in the second half by moving the physical David Moss into a forward position and relieving Youssef Rossi of his unequal struggle with Didier Agathe, who was shackled more effectively by the pace of the substitute Chris McGroarty. Celtic's third came courtesy of Neil Lennon's shot drilled low from a corner, his first for the club. The away support was determined to cocoon him with affection in stark contrast to the sectarian abuse he received from a group of Northern Ireland fans in midweek. His international future will be decided over the next few days after further discussions with the Celtic manager Martin O'Neill and the player's family, including perhaps an uncle who was at Windsor Park and felt intimidated. \"I don't mind the booing, it doesn't bother me. But it is my family I have to consider,\" said Lennon. Of Sunday's victory, O'Neill said: \"To win in such style was magnificent.\" However, he suggested comments made on Friday indicating an interest in bolstering the squad with players of the quality of Spurs' Sol Campbell were \"a bit of fun\". \"I'm now going for Figo and Rivaldo,\" he joked. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
