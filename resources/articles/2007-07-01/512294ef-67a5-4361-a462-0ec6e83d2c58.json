Two shots ahead overnight, the Spaniard maintained his lead over the field with a level-par second round of 71 and a 36-hole total of 136. His performance yesterday was not one for the scrap book, as Garc\u00eda himself conceded afterwards. But as the oldest clich\u00e9 in the golfing lexicon almost reads, it is not how, it is how many behind is Tiger Woods? The answer as the world No1 approached Carnoustie's brutal closing stretch was that he trailed by six shots. Nothing is beyond Woods but watching him hit his tee shot on the 1st hole out of bounds - the first of many uncharacteristic shockers, incidentally - it was hard to believe that anyone, even a man possessed of his redemptive powers, could snatch an improbable win two days on. The American has battled his game since landing in Scotland earlier in the week and he will need to resolve the conflict overnight in order to win his third successive Claret Jug. If he does, then Garc\u00eda had better watch out. If not, then KJ Choi, with a 36-hole total of 138, four-under par, and Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez, who shot a one-under-par 70 to finish on three under, present the biggest barriers to his ambitions. Jim Furyk, the man with the loopy swing and the steely determination, was lurking in a group of five players a further shot behind. All three are capable of winning this tournament but from the Spaniard's point of view none is perhaps as ominous as Choi. The Korean, the winner of two PGA tournaments in the past couple of months and a textbook exponent of America-style golf, was perfectly at ease in the incongruous setting of a seaside links, picking up five birdies on his way to a round of 69. \"I didn't think I would be in second place going into the weekend but I did feel really comfortable with my game as I was here in 1999 and I know the golf course,\" Choi said. \"I am playing as well as I have ever played.\" He also has the indefatigable Andy Prodger on his bag. The Englishman won two majors with Nick Faldo and on a course such as this has got to be worth at least a stroke a round to his player. Even so Garc\u00eda had the bearing of a putative winner as he stepped off the 18th green. \"I have definitely got a good chance of winning,\" was his first reaction when he saw the leaderboard, although he toned down his exuberance when the question was posed a little later. \"It is just a matter of waiting and seeing what happens, but I'd rather be leading than be eight shots behind, that's for sure, because you don't feel like you have push your game to the limit all the time.\" The Spaniard's failure to win a major championship since he captured the public's imagination at the 1999 PGA Championship in Chicago is one of the game's enduring conundrums. More than any other of the current generation of European players, Garc\u00eda has the natural talent to win a fistful of major championships, as he so amply illustrated on his first hole yesterday after hitting a poor tee shot. He followed that as he indelicately put it, with a shank into the thick rough short of the green. Facing a certain bogey, he somehow feathered his wedge shot out of thick rough, up and over a bunker protecting the flag to within six inches of the hole rolling to within. \"It was nice shot,\" the Spaniard shrugged when asked where it ranks in his collection of gems. Nice shots have never been Garc\u00eda's problem. His problem through the years has been his putting, although he has addressed that this week by using the belly putter. Its impact has been dramatic, with putts that might once have had him trembling over the ball being stroked into the centre of the cup. The effect on his off-course demeanour has been equally apparent, not least in his willingness to match himself against Woods. \"I'd love to,\" he said when asked if he would like to play alongside the world No1 in tomorrow's final pairing. Given last year's humbling experience at Royal Liverpool, when Woods routed him in the final group, he should be careful what he wishes for. Yet his bravado should be admired. God knows, a few of his Ryder Cup colleagues could have done with it. For all the pre-tournament talk about this being the year that a home player would finally follow in Paul Lawrie's footsteps, Justin Rose, Paul Casey, both on two over par, and Luke Donald and David Howell on four over, have been consigned to the ranks of also-rans after two days. Even more abject was Colin Montgomerie, who swaggered into Carnoustie as if he owned the place and played the first two rounds like a man who was struggling to meet the mortgage payments. Meanwhile, the 18-year-old Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy followed his first-round 68 with a five-over 76 - a disappointing sequel to a magical first day, no doubt, but he was on course for the consolation prize of the silver medal awarded to the tournament's highest-placed amateur."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
