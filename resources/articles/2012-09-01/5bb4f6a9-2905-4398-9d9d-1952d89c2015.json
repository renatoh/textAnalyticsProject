A partial tear to the patella tendon in his left knee has put the world No3 out of action since June \u2013 his last match was his second-round defeat to Lukas Rosol at Wimbledon. The 26-year-old withdrew from the London Olympics, where he was the defending champion and Spain's flag bearer, and the US Open because of the injury. The chances of the former World No1 being back in time to prepare properly for the start of next year looked in serious doubt on Monday when he said he would be out for another two months. But Ruiz-Cotorro has revealed the timescale could be shorter. \"We have completely ruled out surgery,\" he said at a news conference in Barcelona. \"During the next month we'll be doing training with a lot of physiotherapy, combined with hydrotherapy and laser, and we'll see how he progresses.\" He added: \"We believe that within two months the tendon will be in what we consider a normal state. In a month's time, if the tests and his progress are positive, he can get back to work on the court. But that's not the main goal, that is for the tendon to recover with the same strength it had.\" Knee injuries have troubled Nadal before \u2013 he missed the defence of his Wimbledon title in 2009 due to tendinitis \u2013 but Ruiz-Cottoro is confident that the Spaniard will not be plagued by the current tendon injury for the rest of his career. \"It won't necessarily drag on, this injury,\" he said. \"He wants to play when he can do so in perfect condition and not just for one tournament but to have continuity. \"When they tell you that you can't play such important tournaments you are never pleased but now he is keen to recover and return as soon as possible.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
