That Coventry's saviour was the unsung and little known Norwegian defender Runar Normann, who marked his appearance as a substitute by scoring his first goal for the Sky Blues, only served to make Wednesday's capitulation all the more galling. Wednesday, with their dimunitive striker Leon Knight dwarfed by Coventry's towering centre backs Calum Davenport and Gary Caldwell, looked as though they had neglected to tell their mascot the game had started. There was nothing school boyish about their early sorties, however. Knight's close control allied to his pace plus the inventive promptings of Gerard Sibon proved a recipe for an uncomfortable first 20 minutes for the City defenders which came to a head when Paul McLaren nodded the ball against City's left-hand post. Not that City, with Gary McAllister making his experience tell in midfield and Gary Bothroyd's speed and bustle doing likewise up front, could be described as Sky Blue wallflowers in a game that swung crazily from end to end. An over-zealous challenge on Bothroyd almost proved more costly than a yellow card for Leigh Bromby when Youssef Safri's subsequent free kick curled just wide, and City's best move of the first period ended similarly when Dean Gordon's defensive origins betrayed him. City drew level in the shivering the timbers stakes shortly after the interval following a free kick awarded for Alan Quinn's foul on Bothroyd. McAllister, some 30 yards from goal, shaped up to test Kevin Pressman before executing a wedge that fooled the Wednesday defence into allowing Bothroyd to fire against the bar. The near miss proved all the more galling in the 58th minute when Wednesday scored the goal their earlier enterprise had threatened but failed to deliver. Sibon began the move, Knight passed to McLaren who, after drawing two defenders, returned the ball for the striker to drive a low right-footed shot past Morten Hyldgaard from the edge of the penalty area. Wednesday's lead lasted just 18 minutes before Normann powerfully headed home the equaliser from McAllister's right wing cross."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
