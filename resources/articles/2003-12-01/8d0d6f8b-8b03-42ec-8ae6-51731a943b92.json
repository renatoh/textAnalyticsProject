However, each job of this type can attract up to a hundred applicants so look at enhancing what you have. In addition to proof-reading skills, publishers look for experience of copy editing and desktop publishing. You may be able to do some training related to this through your current job. If not, there are a range of flexible courses you could combine with working, such as those offered by the Publishing Training Centre, (www.train4publishing.co.uk) An impressive covering letter is crucial to applications for jobs where you'll be working with the written word. You're aiming to prove that you are capable of editing the writing of others - your own must therefore be of an exceptionally high standard. Spelling or punctuation errors would rule you out immediately. You must show a deep understanding of that publisher's specialism and demonstrate how your skills relate to their business. Also be sure you have an appreciation of the market sectors they target. Use the company website and trade press to gather this information - the Bookseller and Publishing News are also good sources of vacancies. Got a career problem?
