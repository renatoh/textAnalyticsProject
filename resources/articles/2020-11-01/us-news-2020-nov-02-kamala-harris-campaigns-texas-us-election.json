They were turned away after being informed it was invitation-only at the voter-mobilization event. Undeterred, Quintanilla crawled under a fence and after getting scolded by the Secret Service found a spot where he could watch. Harris didn\u2019t risk saying explicitly that she was there last Friday to flip Texas in the election, she left that to state Democratic luminaries and her former rivals for the presidential nomination, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Juli\u00e1n Castro, who came to stump for her and see this border community as key. She flew into nearby McAllen, which is most likely to ring a bell in the wider world for Trump-era scenes of trauma. It was in the city that border agents separated migrant children from their families and caged them under hardline immigration policies, some not to see their parents again to this day. The area has also been hit hard by coronavirus. At 4.43pm, a waving, beaming Harris sashayed on stage in jeans, blazer and her now-signature Converse sneakers with \u201c2020\u201d on the heel, to exuberant cheering and Mary J Blige\u2019s Work That blasting from speakers. \u201cThey often criticize you for your skin tone, wanna hold your head high,\u201d the R&amp;B lyrics blared to about 200 vehicles gathered for the drive-in rally from various parts of the predominantly Hispanic region known as the Rio Grande Valley. The rest of Quintanilla\u2019s family stayed in their car and strained to see the event from a nearby property, which was quickly filling up with Donald Trump supporters, who heckled without wearing masks. This shocked the Quintanillas, who have struggled with unemployment and illness since Covid-19 took turns infecting their family members during a pandemic surge in in the valley this summer. \u201cJuly was the worst time. My dad didn\u2019t have a job. I didn\u2019t have a job. The only one working was my sister and she\u2019s the one that ended up catching the virus,\u201d Quintanilla told the Guardian later. Like a majority of local families, the Quintanillas were uninsured. \u201cWe can\u2019t pay for this,\u201d he said, referring to the kind of medicines available to the president when he caught coronavirus, but not to all, adding: \u201cOur family members would just send us random remedies they found on Facebook.\u201d The interference by Trump supporters was far from an isolated incident, with a Biden campaign bus almost run off the road later seeming to delight the president. Harris\u2019s visit to Texas just before election day began in Forth Worth, then Edinburg, then Houston. The three counties incorporating those places, Tarrant, Hidalgo and Harris, respectively, feature prominently on Texas\u2019 grim list of Covid-19\u2019s impact. Harris county has reported the highest number of Covid-19 fatalities at 2,806. Hidalgo is the eighth most populous county but has the Lone Star state\u2019s second highest death toll at 1,699, while Tarrant\u2019s is sixth. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be this bad,\u201d Kamala Harris said as she prefaced journalist Bob Woodward\u2019s reporting that the president was warned of the virus\u2019 danger to America on 28 January, much earlier than the public, and deliberately played it down. \u201cCan you imagine, Rio Grande [Valley], what you would\u2019ve done on 28 January if you had known what the president had known? What you as a frontline worker \u2026 as a parent \u2026 a teacher \u2026 a small business owner, what you would have done?\u201d She segued into Republicans\u2019 sustained efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act. Rally-goers honked their horns when she asked whether they knew someone with breast cancer, lupus, diabetes, or high-blood pressure. Jesus Quintanilla was rooting for left-winger Bernie Sanders before he was beaten to the presidential nomination by Joe Biden. But he has already cast his ballot for Biden and Harris. \u201cShe\u2019s more moderate, but if that\u2019s what it takes to appeal to most Democrats, then that\u2019s fine by me,\u201d he said. Hidalgo and Harris counties are blue for the Democrats, Tarrant narrowly Republican red. As Harris alighted from her plane in McAllen on Friday, a pool reporter had asked her why she was campaigning in south Texas. The California senator said: \u201cBecause there are people here who matter.\u201d In her Edinburg speech, there was no mention of reliably-Republican Texas\u2019s evolution into a battleground state this cycle. But those stumping with her were willing to be hostages to fortune. Juli\u00e1n Castro took the stage and declared: \u201cFor the first time in more than a generation, Texas is going to go Democratic on Tuesday night.\u201d His twin brother, congressman Joaquin Castro, added: \u201cWe have a chance to take this country in a different direction, to take the politics of Texas in a different direction, to get ready to replace the statewide Republican leadership in 2022.\u201d And Beto O\u2019Rourke, another 2020 presidential rival, also warmed up for Harris on stage, having driven the 750 miles to the eastern end of the Texas-Mexico border from his former congressional district at the far western end, El Paso. The areas have similar demographics, economics, and political leanings. \u201cThis community \u2026 listen to me, folks, with the polls showing Donald Trump and Joe Biden tied in Texas, it could put our 38 electoral college votes\u2026[it] could end this national nightmare on 3 November,\u201d he said. Outside a Hidalgo county polling site in Palmview, earlier in the day, he explained why turnout was especially crucial this year, telling the Guardian: \u201cI think the [Rio Grande] Valley, like my hometown of El Paso, has always been taken for granted, because it\u2019s so reliably blue.\u201d The valley has low voter turnout and the Democratic party has neglected to campaign there \u2013 but not this year, O\u2019Rourke said. They\u2019re looking at the big picture as Democratic support builds across the state, with an eye on winning the popular vote in Texas and therefore, with the winner-takes-all system, the state\u2019s valuable haul of votes in the electoral college, which clinches the presidency. He gestured around him, explaining: \u201cThe Valley holds the key to deciding how Texas will do. And Texas holds the key in determining who the next president of the United States will be, so I think it\u2019s all here.\u201d By Friday night, 9.6 million Texans had voted early, already more than the entire Texas vote in 2016, and representing 57% of registered voters statewide, though only 48% of registered voters in Hidalgo county had cast their ballots. With a few days still to go and a quarter of people in the county normally waiting to vote until election day itself, Harris and her cohort clearly saw a campaign stop in Edinburg as worth it. O\u2019Rourke emphasized that in such a solidly Democratic county, higher turnout overall translates into disproportionately more votes for Biden going into the state\u2019s popular vote pot. He said: \u201cIf we get six out of every 10 voters, then not only does the Valley break every voter turnout record ever set, but [it] puts Texas over the top for Joe Biden.\u201d Quintanilla was more cautious. \u201cDo I think we\u2019re going to be blue this time? I don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cHopefully.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
