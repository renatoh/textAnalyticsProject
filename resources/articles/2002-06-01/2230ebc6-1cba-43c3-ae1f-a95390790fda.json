Even the news last night that his son Hong-up was being questioned on multi-million-pound bribery allegations could not prevent him from donning a red T-shirt, putting on a fixed smile and declaring through clenched teeth that a national team ranked 150-1 outsiders at the outset of the World Cup are destined to provide its most enchanting success story yet. Ludicrous as it might once have seemed, there is now some support, even among unbiased observers, for the suggestion that South Korea could go all the way. Black-market tickets for the final are already on sale here at 2m won (\u00a31,100) and there has been a dramatic shift in expectations going into tomorrow's quarter-final against Spain. Ahn Jung-hwan's golden goal has been analysed from every possible angle at every possible excuse. And, between times, a wonderfully lop-sided view of Spain has been projected to a TV-viewing audience that peaked at 98.3% of the population during Tuesday's defeat of Italy. Forget the fact that this is Spain's most convincing start to a World Cup since 1950 in Brazil. As the slow-motion replays are shown over and over again of Fernando Hierro conceding a penalty against Ireland, the commentators roar approvingly. When the Spanish defenders are seen remonstrat ing with each other after conceding a goal to South Africa, there are great whoops of delight. Echoing his president's confidence, Shin Moon-sun (SBS's answer to Des Lynam) told his viewers last night: \"If an average team like South Africa can score two against Spain, just imagine the number we can get on Saturday.\" Six times the host nation has won the tournament - France in 1998, Argentina in 1978, Germany in 1974, England in 1966, Italy in 1934 and Uruguay in 1930 - and most South Koreans now believe it can happen again. \"We know there is a chance,\" says Ki Ryong-song, spokesman for the Korean Football Association. \"Some people are saying our place in the semi-finals is already established. A lot of people are bragging that we will reach the final. That is the attitude now.\" Spain will provide formidable opposition and it is a distinct advantage for Jose Antonio Camacho's team that they have had an extra two days to recover from their last game, against Ireland. Yet Guus Hiddink's players will arrive in Gwangju, travelling on a team bus upon which they have allowed fans to scrawl hundreds of good-luck messages, full of innocent anticipation and devoid of trepidation. \"Before, whenever we played a major European team, the players were never confident,\" says Ki. \"Now it is totally different. It is a very young side; they are proud of their heritage and no longer fearful. It is a new generation.\" Hiddink, who is being linked with a return to PSV Eindhoven for the start of next season, is too wily, too long in the tooth and too sensible to be enticed into any unwise predictions. But South Korea's odds have come down to 14-1 and no element of fluke has been attached to their achievements so far. Against the United States, Poland, Portugal and Italy they have shown that they belong in such company. \"Any of their first XI could play in Europe if they really wanted to,\" Brad Friedel, the US goalkeeper, said yesterday. \"There's no doubt they have the technique. They work very hard and are probably the fittest team I have ever played against. I'm sure that scouts in Europe will be looking at them.\" It is a view Hiddink shares, having had his squad together since February as the national league was suspended for preparation. \"When I arrived they didn't dare to take the initiative,\" he explains. \"They played a very obligatory style but now they dare to take a few more risks. They will have the courage now to go one on one when there is the chance of failure. I am seeing them grow as people and become more confident as footballers.\" Hiddink's curriculum vitae incorporates spells with Real Madrid, Valencia and Real Betis, so there will be added poignancy tomorrow for a man who has single-handedly changed the attitudes of South Korean football. \"I noticed straight away there were a lot of differences,\" he says. \"For starters, a coach here has the right to give his players a flick. Physical punishment is part of their culture and the players would accept it if I gave them a swipe. But I believe it would create an undesirable situation and I have tried to coach them the European way.\" Such is the level of feverish excitement throughout the country, universities have rescheduled their end-of-year examinations while police officers and medical staff have been asked to cancel leave. In Busan two people died from heart attacks during extra-time of the Italy game and at Sangmu Citizens' Park a 20-year-old woman was hurt after fainting when Ahn scored the winner. Around four million people are expected on the streets of South Korea tomorrow, with the game being shown live on 360 giant screens across the country. \"It's like having one beer after another beer after another beer; you forget there may be a hangover at the end of it,\" says Shin In-cheoul, the president of the Red Devils. \"At the moment we don't want to think about that hangover. We want to win the World Cup.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
