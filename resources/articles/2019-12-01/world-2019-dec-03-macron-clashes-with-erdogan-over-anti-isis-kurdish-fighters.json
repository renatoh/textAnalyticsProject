The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, for his part threatened again to veto Nato\u2019s defence plan for the Baltics unless Nato endorsed its own assessment that Syrian Kurdish fighters on Turkey\u2019s borders were terrorists, a definition that Macron and the Pentagon rejected. Trump also kept up his demand that \u201cdelinquent\u201d Nato states boost their defence spending, warning if they did not do so he would consider imposing US trade sanctions. The sense of disarray, reflecting wider differences about Nato\u2019s future post-cold war purpose, emerged through a series of revealing rolling press conferences hosted by Trump. Late on Tuesday, in a further sign of disunity, footage emerged from a Buckingham Palace reception of leaders including Macron, the British summit host, Boris Johnson, and the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau appearing to mock Trump\u2019s lengthy media appearances. Johnson largely kept a low profile, but convened a meeting in Downing Street in an effort to forge a common European-Turkish approach to the crisis in north-east Syria where tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds have been displaced because of the October invasion by Turkey and its proxies. Macron\u2019s original condemnation of Nato\u2019s \u201cbrain death\u201d stemmed from his anger at the lack of any Turkish cooperation with the rest of Nato over the invasion. Only Trump was consulted; he gave a green light that led to a massive political backlash in the US. Macron on Tuesday repeatedly warned that Isis was making a comeback in Syria because of the Turkish invasion since it had weakened the mainly Kurdish Syrian Defence Forces, including the YPD fighters, that have formed the backbone of the fight against Isis. At one point Macron accused Turkey of sometimes working with Isis proxies. Macron said he supported Nato developing wider goals including combating terrorism but said: \u201cI am sorry we do not have the same definition of terrorism around the table. When I look at Turkey, they now are fighting against those who fight with us, who fought with us, shoulder to shoulder, against Isis. And sometimes they work with Isis proxies.\u201d Turkey has to end its ambiguities towards these groups, he said. He added: \u201cI understand they now want to block all the declarations of this summit unless we agree their definition of terrorism. It is not our definition.\u201d The French president asked how it was possible to be a member of the Nato alliance and for Turkey to purchase the Russian S-400 air defence system. \u201cTechnically it is not possible,\u201d he said. Macron, in common with most Nato states\u2019 leaders, maintains that a Russian defence system inside Nato will expose its military hardware, including the F-35 fighter jets, to Russian military intelligence. Pressed by a reporter about whether the US was going to sanction Turkey for buying the S-400 as the US Congress was demanding, Trump said he was looking at the issue. He then claimed, incorrectly, that Turkey had been forced into looking at the S-400 because Barack Obama had refused to let Turkey buy the US patriot defence system. \u201cTurkey for a long period of time wanted very much to buy the Patriot system,\u201d Trump said. Obama, he said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t sell\u201d it. In fact the Obama administration offered the weapon to Turkey repeatedly but Erdo\u011fan refused because the US deal did not include the Patriot\u2019s underlying technology. After Trump\u2019s defence of the Turkish position, Macron interjected. \u201cIt\u2019s their own decision,\u201d he said of Turkey, adding that Europe had also offered to sell Erdo\u011fan an air-defence system. \u201cEven having a European option, totally compliant with Nato, they decided not to be compliant with Nato.\u201d Trump then asked Macron whether he would take any of the foreign fighters that America had captured in Syria and Iraq. Trump said \u201cWe have a tremendous amount of captured fighters in Syria under lock and key, mainly from Europe. Would you like some nice Isis fighters? I could give them to you. You can take everyone you want.\u201d When Macron replied in a generality about the future status of Isis terrorists, Trump said: \u201cThat is why he is such a great politician. That is one of the greatest non-answers I have heard and that\u2019s OK.\u201d As the tense exchanges continued Macron said: \u201cLet\u2019s be serious. It is true you have fighters coming from Europe. But it\u2019s a minority problem of the overall problem we have. And I think the number one priority because it is not yet finished is to get rid of Isis.\u201d At an earlier press conference Trump had been ruder about Macron, saying his remarks about Nato being brain dead were \u201cvery, very nasty\u201d comments. \u201cI think that\u2019s insulting to a lot of different forces,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t go around making statements like that about Nato. It\u2019s very disrespectful.\u201d Trump has himself once called Nato obsolete. Macron has argued ever since the Turkish invasion of north-east Syria in October that the move was a disastrous distraction from the continuing priority of defeating Isis. He was also furious that the US started to withdraw all its remaining 500 troops from the area, effectively handing over airbases to Russia. In an attempt to show his solidarity with the Syrian Kurds, Macron has also hosted political leaders of the Syrian YPD in Paris, praising them for the sacrifices they had made to defeat Isis. Although Trump frequently praises Erdo\u011fan, other members of the administration are more critical. The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, in an interview with Reuters agreed with Macron that Nato cannot label the YPD as a terrorist group. He said: \u201cThe message to Turkey \u2026 is we need to move forward on these response plans and it can\u2019t be held up by their own particular concerns,\u201d Esper said as he flew to London. \u201cAlliance unity, alliance readiness, means that you focus on the bigger issues \u2013 the bigger issue being the readiness of the [Nato] alliance. And not everybody\u2019s willing to sign up to their agenda. Not everybody sees the threats that they see.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
