William Barr, the attorney general, claimed the president was the victim of a \u201cbogus narrative\u201d about collusion with Moscow during the 2016 election. Barr served under Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush but has disappointed observers who hoped he would push back against Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories and blatant lies. In his first interviews since the justice department\u2019s inspector general said the Russia investigation was justified, Barr told the Wall Street Journal\u2019s CEO Council: \u201cIt was a travesty, and there were many abuses. From day one, it generated exculpatory information and nothing that substantiated any kind of collusion.\u201d In an interview with NBC, Barr said he still had doubts about the FBI\u2019s motives to pursue a \u201cbaseless\u201d investigation that stemmed from \u201cflimsy\u201d evidence. \u201cI think our nation was turned on its head for three years based on a completely bogus narrative that was largely fanned and hyped by a completely irresponsible press,\u201d Barr said, echoing his boss\u2019s criticisms of the media. \u201cI think there were gross abuses \u2026 and inexplicable behavior that is intolerable in the FBI. \u201cI think that leaves open the possibility that there was bad faith.\u201d Barr pointed out that the FBI used confidential informants who recorded conversations with officials on the Trump campaign. \u201cIt was clearly spied upon,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what electronic surveillance is \u2026 going through people\u2019s emails, wiring people up.\u201d The report by the justice department\u2019s inspector general was released on Monday. It said there was no political bias in the origin and operation of the FBI\u2019s investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow \u2013 a common charge by the president and his allies who allege a supposed \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy. But the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, did find \u201cserious performance failures\u201d in the monitoring of Carter Page, a Trump aide linked with Moscow. Horowitz found 17 \u201csignificant inaccuracies or omissions\u201d in applications for a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance or Fisa court to monitor Page\u2019s communications and subsequent renewals. The attorney general said he disagreed with Horowitz\u2019s conclusion that the FBI had enough information to surveil Page. Officials withheld from judges what he said was key exculpatory information, Barr added. The attorney general\u2019s broadside put him at odds with Democrats, intelligence community figures and the current head of the FBI, Christopher Wray. On ABC on Monday, Wray was asked if he believed the FBI unfairly targeted the Trump campaign. \u201cI do not,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that the inspector general found that, in this particular instance, the investigation was opened with appropriate predication and authorisation.\u201d Trump lashed out. \u201cI don\u2019t know what report current director of the FBI Christopher Wray was reading,\u201d he tweeted, , \u201cbut it sure wasn\u2019t the one given to me. With that kind of attitude, he will never be able to fix the FBI, which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men &amp; women working there!\u201d Trump had apparently been watching Fox News, one side of reliably partisan media responses to the report. \u201cYou have to look at the 17 instances of misconduct cited in the Report,\u201d Trump wrote, \u201cthey are very bad. The Fisa court was clearly taken for a ride on this, a failure of the FBI up and fown [sic] the chain of command. It\u2019s about as strong a medicine as I\u2019ve seen in a report of this kind in a very long time.\u201d Wray also pushed back on the conspiracy theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 election, a line followed by Trump and his supporters. He told ABC: \u201cWe have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election.\u201d The president has fired an FBI director before \u2013 James Comey, in May 2017, perhaps the most consequential act of his presidency prior to the impeachment inquiry. On Tuesday, Trump also took aim at familiar characters: \u201cThe FBI has had some dark day in its past, but nothing like this. This was VERY SERIOUS MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF THE FBI. \u2026 Are you listening Comey, McCabe, lovers Lisa &amp; Peter, the beautiful Ohr family, Brennan, Clapper &amp; many more?\u201d Andrew McCabe is a former deputy director of the FBI, fired by Trump. Bruce and Nellier Ohr are a justice department official and his wife, who worked with the political intelligence company Fusion GPS. John Brennan was director of the CIA under Barack Obama, and James Clapper was director of national intelligence. The \u201clovers Lisa &amp; Peter\u201d are Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer, and Peter Strzok, a former FBI agent. Strzok was fired in the fallout from the Comey firing.. Page claimed vindication. She tweeted on Monday: \u201cThe sum total of findings by IG Horowitz that my personal opinions had any bearing on the course of either the Clinton or Russia investigations? Zero and Zero.\u201d Comey was similarly satisfied, writing in the Washington Post that Horowitz demonstrated \u201cthe allegation of a criminal conspiracy was nonsense. There was no illegal wiretapping, there were no informants inserted into the campaign, there was no \u2018spying\u2019 on the Trump campaign. Although it took two years, the truth is finally out.\u201d But Christopher Steele, an ex-British intelligence operative, disputed some of the inspector general\u2019s assertions. His lawyers claimed the report \u201ccontains several serious errors and misstatements\u201d, including the portrayal of Steele as a confidential human source (CHS). \u201cChristopher Steele repeatedly told the FBI that he could not be a CHS because his obligations to his former government employer prohibited his acting in such a capacity,\u201d the statement said. Steele also denied that the FBI asked him not to speak to the media and criticised the report for appearing to suggest his intelligence agency, Orbis, was inaccurate in its reporting on Page."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
