I feigned annoyance that the puzzles weren\u2019t cryptic; they are, in fact a challenging and literate take on the American puzzle style, which often misleads in a way that\u2019s not a million miles from our own crosswords. The New Yorker did have a cryptic \u2013 in the 1990s. Last month, the magazine created the post of puzzles-and-games editor. Liz Maynes-Aminzade is the inaugural honcho and, she tells me, was persuaded by her colleague Nick Henriquez to try solving some of the cryptics in the archive. \u201cI had to really sweat through the first five or so,\u201d she says, \u201cbut then something clicked. Now, of course, I love them.\u201d A batch of the old puzzles has reappeared as a kind of Thanksgiving gift, with more to follow weekly. They\u2019re very moreish, partly because they use 10-by-8 grids (in \u201cportrait\u201d orientation); I presumed that this was solely to give newcomers a gentler solving experience, but there\u2019s more to it. Says Maynes-Aminzade: Hendrik Hertzberg, the senior editor who originally launched the cryptic (with the blessing of Tina Brown, the British editor of the New Yorker at the time), devised this grid design so the puzzle could fit into a single column of the magazine. Of course the visuals were part of the decision. And in terms of construction, the clues are closer to the Guardian\u2019s quiptic (\u201cfor beginners and those in a hurry\u201d) than, say, an Enigmatist workout. I wondered what would be the American equivalents of all those British abbreviations from cricket and the armed forces that make UK cryptics that little bit tricker for non-native solvers. Letters denoting things from private healthcare, sports leagues and the way they name their radio stations, perhaps? But the hurdle isn\u2019t there. \u201cWhen our puzzles use abbreviations and initialisms,\u201d says Maynes-Aminzade, \u201cthey tend to be common ones: periodic table elements, cardinal directions, etc. In other words, our puzzle is easier than yours!\u201d \u201cMaybe the closest analog,\u201d she adds, \u201cwould be names of American actors \u2013 I\u2019ve seen multiple puzzles that play on SLY for Sylvester Stallone, for instance. But I imagine even these references to the Italian Stallion will be legible to British solvers.\u201d They are, and it\u2019s worth noting here that it\u2019s a shame that I come across the fine Irish actor Stephen RAE more often in American puzzles than I do in the film pages of British papers. And in the New Yorker\u2019s cryptics, there are more British bits and pieces \u2013 ETON collars, say \u2013 than I had expected to find. Does the American cryptic community overlap with the anglophone gang? I only have anecdotal evidence, but I highly suspect it does. The New Yorker once published a cryptic that had ADAM BEDE in the grid \u2013 clued \u2018Plot in a lady\u2019s novel\u2019 \u2013 if that tells you anything. (Mr Bede is not exactly a household name over here, it pains me to say.) Yes, we know the type. Some of them probably even read the Guardian. Two of the paper\u2019s setters, Anna Shechtman and Erik Agard, have made a video guide to cryptic wordplay. Depending how the old puzzles go down, we may be seeing some new cryptics from the likes of that pair. I hope we do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
