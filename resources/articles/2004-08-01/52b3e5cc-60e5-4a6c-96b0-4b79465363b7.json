The Dutch striker will undergo surgery early next week as his team-mates travel to Romania and is expected to be out for four weeks. That will rule him out of United's opening Premiership fixture against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge as well as their games with Norwich, Blackburn and Everton. Confirmation of the hernia came as a second blow for United, who will pay out almost \u00a3300,000 in compensation to supporters who had attended last night's second round of matches in the Vodafone Cup, only for the tournament to be scrapped after Old Trafford was hit by a fierce electrical storm 78 minutes into the evening's first game, between PSV Eindhoven and Boca Juniors. Van Nistelrooy was withdrawn at half-time in Tuesday's victory over his former club PSV and was omitted from the squad for last night's cancelled match against Urawa Red Diamonds. Arsenal's move for Mathieu Flamini has hit a snag after the France Under-21 midfielder was refused international clearance by the French Football Federation. The 20-year-old had impressed during pre-season but Marseille complained to the French league's justice commission about his transfer. In France, young players must sign their first professional contract with the club from whose academy they emerged. Flamini, despite several appearances in Marseille's run to the Uefa Cup final last season, had signed no such deal, prompting his move to Arsenal last month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
