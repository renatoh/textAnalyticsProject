Speaking for the first time since Australia sealed an emphatic 4-0 series win in the final Test at the SCG, the Test captain stressed that he and those around him need to recalibrate how England can move forward. Root also said he was prepared to defy the wish of Trevor Bayliss, the head coach, that he take a recuperative break from the game. Root declined to rest for the forthcoming T20i tri-series against Australia and New Zealand and believes that series and the Indian Premier League are necessary for his development as a multi\u2011format batsman. Root said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a period of time going into the New Zealand series where I want to get myself clear on how I want to move forward, along with Trevor and the support staff, and make sure when we start that tour there is a clear indication of what direction we\u2019re going to be going in. If the lads aren\u2019t prepared to get on board with that then we\u2019ve got to go with someone different. But I\u2019m sure everyone will be absolutely 100% in the same thinking.\u201d The 27-year-old has been recovering from the gastroenteritis that kept him up the night before the last day of the Sydney Test. While he was able to bat in the morning after a trip to hospital, he had to retire on 58 at lunch. It meant his series finished with 378 runs (the second most for England) and five half-centuries but no three-figure score. By contrast, his opposite number, Steve Smith, chalked up an impressive 687, with three centuries, including a top-score of 239 and an average of 137.40. What time Root had on his sickbed was spent plotting recovery, which begins in May with two Tests against New Zealand. By then, he will have more clarity on how best to move on and has urged his team-mates to follow his lead. Four years ago, a 5-0 whitewash brought changes to personnel. Andy Flower was deposed as coach, Kevin Pietersen was banished from international cricket and Graeme Swann retired through injury. Root played the first three Tests of the 2013-14 tour before being dropped and is keen to heed the lessons of this tumultuous period in English cricket. \u201cFour years ago, one of the big things was that within two months of the end of that tour, it was a completely different team. There were a lot of new faces at the start of the next Test match. One thing we learned from that is how important it is to stay together. You always learn from experiences when it\u2019s difficult. You have to make sure that they make you a stronger character and go the other way.\u201d Root also confirmed he will enter the IPL auction, despite the protestations of Bayliss. \u201cThe schedule is full on. I\u2019ve always said I put playing for England first and if it means resting from things like the IPL, which I\u2019ve done in the past, I\u2019ll happily do that. For however long my international career lasts it\u2019s going to be focused about giving as much as I can for this team and playing for England. \u201cBut one thing I\u2019ve been very aware of for the past two years is the lack of T20 cricket. When that World Cup does come around, this is probably the best window of opportunity for me to develop that white-ball side of my game. You\u2019ve seen how quickly one-day cricket has moved forward in the last three or four years. \u201cAs someone involved in the Test side I don\u2019t want to be missing white-ball cricket and falling behind, trying to catch up. I want to make sure I\u2019m keeping my place and setting the standards in this team, leading the way. \u201cThe IPL is a great opportunity. It may be that I don\u2019t have a great IPL but the best thing would be the exposure to different players and different ways of looking at the game, being under pressure for long periods of time. I can\u2019t see how that could hamper my game or be detrimental to my England career.\u201d Root will be one of 26 England players to enter this year\u2019s IPL auction, which takes place on 27 and 28 January. The tournament itself is scheduled to run from 4 April to 31 May, meaning Root\u2019s availability will be only partial given his international commitments, with the second Test against New Zealand scheduled to finish on 3 April and the first Test of the English summer (against Pakistan at Lord\u2019s) starting on 24 May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
