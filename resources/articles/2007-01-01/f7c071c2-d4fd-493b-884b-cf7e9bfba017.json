Few analysts, let alone opponents, expect him to find something exciting to say to Scots any time soon. Mr Cameron can take comfort from the fact that it's a situation Edinburgh-born Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Ming Campbell and the SNP leader, Alex Salmond, all of them Scots, also face as they head into the third elections to the revived Scottish parliament at Holyrood on May 3. Labour usually does worse in purely Scottish elections than in UK ones, since the Holyrood parliament invites Scots answers to Scots questions and, unlike Rhodri Morgan in Wales, first minister Jack McConnell does not highlight his differences with the UK Labour party. So when Mr McConnell loses seats on May 3 Iraq, Blair and the trust issue will drag down his own team's lacklustre performance. Labour, with 50 of Holyrood's 129 seats, in coalition with 17 Lib Dems, only needs to lose three of their 67 combined seats to lose their majority. What would then happen? Even on the SNP's most upbeat poll (YouGov's) the SNP would win 18 seats, but still have only 45, so it would need its own coalition. With whom? The Lib Dems don't seem keen and there won't be enough of them. Mr Salmond, one of the irrepressible cheeky chappies of British politics, would also need the Greens or Tommy Sheridan's split and weakened Scottish Socialists. Little wonder that Labour's main strategy (copyright G Brown) is to frighten 'don't know' voters (one in three) that the SNP promise of a referendum on independence - which may be legally impossible anyway - threatens stability and the Union of 1707. His henchman, Alistair Darling, will today rubbish Salmond's promise to keep sterling. In any case, Salmond, who hedges his bet by keeping his Westminster seat, is far from certain of winning one in Holyrood. If he fails to seize a Lib Dem seat in Gordon he will be lucky to win a \"top-up\" seat on the regional list. Whatever the outcome the Scotland Act stipulates that Holyrood MSPs must pick a first minister within 28 days or face fresh elections. So Mr Cameron's Scottish leader, the genial Annabel Goldie, may find herself backing a Labour minority government as the least worst option. That will not resolve Mr Cameron's strategic dilemma: what to say to Scots? In 1955 Tories won half Scots votes and seats. Thatcherism and the poll tax are usually blamed for its decline to one MP and 16% of the vote today, though some trace it to the abolition of the distinctive Scottish Unionist Party (SUP) in 1965. The Tory leader told Glasgow's Herald newspaper this week that the party should stand for \"common sense\". A stronger Tory slogan is \"fiscal responsibility\", which would help shed its anti-devolution past by backing stronger tax powers for Holyrood. Alas, Scots Tories are split over it. That's another problem they all have in common."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
