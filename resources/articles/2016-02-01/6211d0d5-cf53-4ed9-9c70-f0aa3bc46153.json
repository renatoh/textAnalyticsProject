Sunderland\u2019s manager, who worked with Gartside during eight successful years at Bolton including Premier League status and twice securing European qualification, has described the experience as \u201cmagical\u201d. Although the pair parted on bad terms, their once \u201cperfect\u201d relationship was repaired and they last spoke shortly before Christmas. \u201cFrom the point of view of how long I have known Phil and the family, it was devastating news,\u201d said Allardyce, who managed Bolton from 1999-2007, when he left to take charge of Newcastle United. \u201cI was aware of the illness before but kept that very close to myself. My condolences go out to the family. \u201cMy memories are great \u2013 even though later on we may not have seen eye to eye \u2013 but certainly the journey we took from 1999 to 2007 was magical. We took that journey together and basically rebuilt a club that achieved great success. \u201cWe had the perfect relationship \u2013 he chairmanned and I managed and we didn\u2019t interfere with each other. We took it upon ourselves to create a new philosophy at a club and had great success. My last game at Bolton we were fifth in the Premier League. Before that we were seventh, sixth, eighth, got to the Carling Cup final and qualified twice for Europe. So it was a great story. \u201cWe had our difficulties at the end, I won\u2019t hide that but my memories are more good than bad because of the journey we had \u2013 and what a journey it was. \u201cI\u2019ll remember the happy times I spent with Phil from 1999, when I joined the club on my 45th birthday. We did dream together about where we might go and we actually turned our dreams into a reality, so I\u2019ll always have those memories. \u201cMy condolences go out to Carol, his wife, and the rest of the family, who I know very well. It was one great journey we had together and it\u2019s a very sad loss for the family, particularly at just 63. I spoke to Phil before Christmas. For me it was a massive shock the position he was in. It was a completely devastating and quick illness.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
