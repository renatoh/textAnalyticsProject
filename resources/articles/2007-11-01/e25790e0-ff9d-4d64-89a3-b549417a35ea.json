Freerice.com", "bodyText": "Fed up with Facebook? Fear not. There is a new website in town perfect for whiling away those long office hours. Better still, you can brush up on your vocabulary while helping to feed the world's poor. Or so Freerice.com promises. Here is how it works: A word appears along with four possible definitions. Choose the right one and the website donates the cost of 10 grains of rice to the United Nations World Food Programme. How? By taking money from advertisers whose brand name flashes across the bottom of the screen. The better you do, the harder the clue. On one sitting, the first word is pollute with the options 'nap', 'refute', 'contaminate' or 'incinerate'. A few dozen words on and this time the player is faced with anthropomorphic and given the options 'piercing', 'humanlike', 'submissive' or 'nourishing'. Freerice.com launched on 7 October and a measly 830 grains of rice were donated to charity that day. By last week the daily amount had hit 77m. The game has even made it into the Washington Post, which asked: 'What if just knowing what a word meant you could help feed hungry people around the world?' With brands including American Express, Apple and Toshiba lapping up the advertising, maybe it can."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
