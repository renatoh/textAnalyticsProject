To the possible delight of gas-guzzling BMW drivers, the party's transport spokesman, Bernard Jenkin, said it was time to consider a change in the law because the present 70 mph limit was \"widely discredited and ignored\". In a speech Mr Jenkin announced that the motorway speed limit would be referred to a new road standards unit. \"On motorways, around 80mph is a normal and safe speed for many drivers in the right conditions,\" he told the Selsdon group. \"The 70mph limit is widely discredited and ignored. If 80mph was legalised, but rigidly enforced, nothing much would change, except to improve respect for the law.\" Mr Jenkin pledged that his unit would transform the lives of motorists by ensuring that \"road providers\" are held to account more effectively. The unit would: \u0095 Make recommendations on sensible speed limits; \u0095 Tackle the problem of roads being repeatedly dug up by utility companies; \u0095 Find ways to reduce road casualty numbers; \u0095 Advise ministers on vital road improvements for better traffic flow; \u0095 Assess new roads for their impact on the environment and advise against roads being built \"on the cheap\"; \u0095 Ensure that motorists are \"treated like customers, rather than the problem\". Mr Jenkin, who was given the freedom to come up with costly proposals after William Hague pledged to match Labour spending on transport, indicated that the Tories would support expensive new road improvement schemes to avoid a repeat of the rows over recent bypasses. \"The Conservatives have learned the lessons of Newbury and Winchester, the public will not support roads on the cheap that compromise environmental standards,\" the shadow transport minister said. \"Money will be spent on tunnels and cuttings. Bridges and viaducts should be of architectural merit to complement the landscape. Roads policy must be more sensitive to the countryside.\" However, Mr Jenkin said that the Tories would adopt a cautious approach to new roads. \"New roads will only be built as a last resort where improvements to existing roads will not suffice.\" His announcement on motorway speed limits appears in marked contrast with a Home Office study which calls for motorists to be banned for a year if they drive more than 85mph on a motorway. The government has indicated it will reject this proposal, although there is no indication that ministers are prepared to endorse an 80mph speed limit. Mr Jenkin's speech indicates the determination of the Tories to court motorists in commuter belts around big cities, who drive to work on motorways. Such middle Britain voters deserted the Tories at the last election. In a bid for their vote, Mr Jenkin said: \"The roads are the only public service left without an independent monitor of performance... the roads standards unit will ensure that road users are treated like customers, rather than as the problem.\" His speech came as the government announced that bus drivers on school run routes are to receive training on how to deal with problem children. The transport minister, Keith Hill, said the drivers would attend training seminars developed by Crime Concern. \"We hope the training will help them feel more confident in dealings with schoolchildren. I also hope that this training will improve the perception that bus drivers and schoolchildren have of each other, leading to fewer incidents of confrontation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
