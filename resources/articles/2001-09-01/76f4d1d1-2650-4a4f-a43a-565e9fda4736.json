Andrew Harwood, managing director of CFS Independent, a firm of independent financial advisers, said that although some commentators are predicting long-term disruption to the markets that could take up to five years to reverse, he believes the position is unlikely to be this serious. \"Tragic as these events undoubtedly are, commerce will continue as before with successful companies likely to flourish and others that will struggle even during growth periods, but especially during periods of global recession, finding the economic climate challenging.\" The initial reaction from private investors to the events in the US was mixed, but many did hold their nerve and chose to wait and see last week, rather than panic-selling their shares. Fund management group Fidelity even took the step of sending a letter to investors in the UK urging them not to make the hasty decision to sell their investments. SG Asset management stated that it was \"cautiously optimistic\" following events in the US last week, but that it believes the slowdown will be longer and deeper than it otherwise would have been. Alec Foster, who manages Hiscox's specialist insurance industry investment fund, said that while it is possible that this will be the biggest single insured loss in the industry's history, the insurance industry can and does make contingency plans for losses even bigger than this. Commenting on how the risk profile of the sector has changed, he said that it will in time recover losses as insurance premiums are revised. Credit Agricole Asset Management said it expects an approximate 10% drop in European equity markets to be the initial reaction when the US markets re-open at 2.30pm (GMT) today. \"Our calculations for the US and Euroland equity markets indicate that at current levels, investors are already allowing for plenty of bad news, such as increased US recession potential, following the disaster,\" it said. \"Investment should be long term and we have to sit through these crises,\" said Mark Dampier of independent financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown. \"Investors should be looking at companies that are well financed to survive hard times.\" Mr Harwood agreed, saying that there is little to suggest that economic behaviour is likely to be significantly different from other acts of terrorism, despite the fact that it struck at the heart of the world's financial markets. Commenting on individual sectors, Mr Dampier said: \"Airlines, leisure stocks and hotel chains are clearly going to get panned at the moment and shares in fund management groups are another thing to avoid.\" \"In the next few weeks there is going to be a great buying opportunity,\" he added. \"Investors who are jittery should phase their investments into the market. So invest a little now and try to buy in gradually on poorer days. This is a very hard thing to do in practice but it should be done.\" Remarking on this morning's news that Friends Provident will reduce its bonus rates and increase its exit penalties on its' with-profits funds as a result of recent falls in stock markets, Mr Dampier said that with-profits investors shouldn't panic. \"This is a market value adjuster (MVA) and will not stay forever,\" he said. Mr Dampier added that the London housing market is likely to cool down drastically in coming months as a result of an end to City bonuses, which he believes largely powered the house price boom in the capital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
