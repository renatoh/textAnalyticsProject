Subs: Juric, Babic, Berbatov, Vranjes, Hejduk, Brdaric, Kleine. Arsenal Seaman, van Bronckhorst, Stepanovs, Campbell, Lauren, Pires, Vieira, Parlour, Wiltord, Kanu, Henry.

Referee Alain Sars (Lorraine) 1 Robert Pires gets up early on the Arsenal left to give Hans-Joerg Butt an early touch in the Leverkusen goal. 2 Oliver Neuville cuts in from the left to shoot straight at David Seaman, who, disconcertingly for Arsenal, allows the ball to rebound from his legs. 4 Thierry Henry close to opening things up 30 yards out from the Leverkusen goal when gets away from Diego Placente. 7 Michael Ballack shoots with his left from 20 yards out but the attentions of Ray Parlour force him to mis-kick into the crowd. 11 Bernd Schneider crosses from the right but Giovanni van Bronckhorst blocks on the edge of the erea; Schneider has another crack but it comes to nothing. 12 Leverkusen again try to attack the Arsenal right as Neuville finds Ze Roberto for a cross into the area. Arsenal immediately clear across the pitch and break; comes to nothing. 15 Yildiray Basturk shoots from 25 yards across the face of Seaman's goal. 17 Leverkusen make a mess of a deft Pires ball into their area; falls to Kanu 16 yards out - Butt dives to his right to palm clear. 19 Good Arsenal pressure as Sylvain Wiltord forces a fine save from Butt at the near post; Arsenal corner makes its way to Kanu at the far post but he is unable to squeeze it through. 25 Basturk gets into the Arsenal area and passes to Ulf Kirsten barely 10 yards out; he delays his shot a little too long, allows Sol Campbell to block and after an almighty scrum Seaman claims. 33 Booking Igor Stepanovs. 36 Leverkusen free-kick over 30 yards out; doesn't stop Ballack having a pop, but Seaman sees it all the way and holds. 38 Ze Roberto and Basturk play a one-two on the left before Ze Roberto charges into the area; gutsy defending from Patrick Vieira and Pires to clear the ball. 39 Arsenal corner after Wiltord's shot; resulting pressure ends with a corner 25 yards out. Henry takes but the wall does its job. 44 Ze Roberto gets in around the back on the left. He lays it back for Neuville 10 yards out but Neuville's appalling first touch allows Vieira to usher the ball out. 45 Arsenal free-kick bang on the right-hand edge of the Leverkusen area as Arsenal play. Van Bronckhorst takes, Butt fluffs his clearance and Leverkusen finally clear. Half-time. The fact that Arsenal, with a stale Seaman in goal, have not conceded a goal makes it a good half for the visitors. 46 A pedestrian start to the second 45 as both teams get themselves back into gear. 49 Leverkusen free-kick 22 yards out to the Arsenal right after Wiltord handles inadvertantly; low to Kirsten 10 yards out but the old man can't control it. 53 Henry down injured on the left after a challenge by Lucio; Henry clearly took a knock but the ref refuses to allow assistance to the Arsenal striker. 56 GOAL: Bayer Leverkusen 0 - 1 Arsenal Made in France this one. Pires races through the middle in acres of space and slides the ball right to Wiltord; Wiltord finds his team-mate running into the area, again in space, for Pires to score inside the far post. 64 Not surprisingly, Leverkusen up the ante in search of an equaliser. Ze Roberto looking dangerous on the right with a whipped in cross before Basturk wins a free-kick on the edge of the area; Ze Roberto takes but it clears the bar by a mile. 68 Sending off Parlour for a second bookable offence. Gille Grimandi on for Wiltord as Arsenal reorganise. 75 Seaman forced to tip over the bar less than a yard out from a Schneider shot. 78 Free-kick to Arsenal wide on the right; Henry and Vieira both miss the ball in the penalty area before Vieira finally slides it right for Pires to hit the side-netting. 81 Leverkusen corner; Ze Roberto takes but there is no one to meet it on the far side of the area. 84 Berbatov comes close to equalising for Leverkusen when his header skims of the crossbar with Seaman beaten. 85 Appeal for handball by Leverkusen when Stepanovs appears to handle when putting behind just wide of the upright - not given. 87 Intense pressure from Leverkusen as they win yet another corner; Neville takes, Vieira clears, Lucio shoots over. Neuville again with a corner; comes to nothing. 89 Another corner to Leverkusen, Neuville again takes comes to nothing. And then a GOAL as Kirsten gets on the end of a 50-yard pass to the far post and shoots home the equaliser. Gutting for Arsenal. 90 Henry wins a corner; van Bronckhorst misses everyone. Full-time Bayer Leverkusen 1 - 1 Arsenal"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
