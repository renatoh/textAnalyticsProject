Sanders\u2019 criticism came as a report claimed Trump had said to wealthy guests at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago on Friday evening, \u201cYou all just got a lot richer\u201d. The senator, speaking to CNN\u2019s State of the Union, said: \u201cAt the end of 10 years, 83% of the the benefits go to the top 1%, 60% of the benefits go to the top one-tenth of 1%, meanwhile well over 80 million Americans will be paying more in taxes, 13 million will lose their healthcare and we will have an additional $1.4tn deficit ...\u201d Trump\u2019s comments, reported by CBS News, were said to be directed to friends dining nearby at the exclusive club that has become known as the \u201cWinter White House.\u201d Earlier in the day Friday he signed the sweeping $1.5tn tax cut bill into law before leaving Washington for the holiday break. Trump spoke at length during the signing, thanking congressional Republicans. He predicted the measures would be \u201ca tremendous thing for the American people\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fantastic for the economy. It\u2019s going to keep companies from leaving our shores and opening up in other countries.\u201d Companies, he said, would go \u201cwild\u201d about this. But his reported comments to guests at Mar-a-Lago, where initiation fees cost $200,000 and carries annual membership fees of $14,000, are certain to grate opponents who reject Trump\u2019s characterization of the tax bill as a break for the middle class. Critics of the measures argue the cuts disproportionately benefit the most affluent Americans. Trump has said the tax bill is \u201cnot good\u201d for him personally, though by some estimates Trump could enjoy a $15m tax break. However, Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns makes this hard to gauge accurately. In his comments Sunday, Sanders flatly rejected Trump\u2019s tax claims: \u201cHis tax plan was going to benefit the middle class, but the bulk of the benefits go to the rich and to large corporations.\u201d \u201cHe was going to take on the drug companies but he appoints the guy to health and human services who comes from the drug companies etc, etc.\u201d Asked to characterize Republican electoral losses in Virginia and Alabama, Sanders described them as a referendum on both Trump\u2019s leadership. \u201cThis is a man who said one thing during the campaign, but his actions are very different. He said he wanted to \u2018drain the swamp,\u2019 but now it looks like the swamp now has more billionaires in his administration than any in American history.\u201d Sanders added that the electoral results should also give party leadership in the House and Senate reason for grave concern. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in Alabama, what we\u2019re seeing in Virginia, New Jersey and in states all across this country, are large voter turnouts, are people standing up and fighting back and demanding that we have a government that represents all of us, not just the 1%. \u201cIf I were the Republicans, I would worry very much about 2018,\u201d Sanders added. Asked by CBS News about Trump\u2019s reported comments on Friday, the White House reiterated the tax cuts would help the middle class. Picking up on Sander\u2019s theme on Sunday, retiring Arizona senator Jeff Flake, a frequent critic of the president, told ABC\u2019s This Week he believed Republican electoral losses signaled his party\u2019s death throes. \u201cWhen you look at some of the audiences cheering for Republicans, sometimes, you look out there and you say, \u2018those are the spasms of a dying party.\u2019\u201d Flake repeated his call for a fundamental re-evaluation of what his party stands for, including its lack of social and racial diversity. \u201cWe\u2019re appealing to older white men and there are just a limited number of them, and anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy.\u201d He added that he hoped that former Trump administration chief strategist Steve Bannon would be marginalized in that process. \u201cThe last thing we need is to push that ultra-nationalist, ethno-nationalist, protectionist kind of element of the party. That\u2019s not good for us,\u201d he added. The senator said he would not rule out challenging Trump in the next presidential election, predicting that if the president continues on his current path, a \u201chuge swath of voters\u201d will be \u201clooking for something else\u201d. Asked if he might run against the Republican incumbent, Flake said \u201cThat\u2019s not in my plans\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d Early Sunday, Trump renewed his attacks on \u201cFake News\u201d in an early morning tweet. Early Saturday, Trump placed a video conference call with soldiers deployed overseas. According to pool reports, he complimented the military on \u201chow well we\u2019re doing\u201d in the fight against terrorism. \u201cWe\u2019re winning.\u201d \u201cI just want to wish everybody a very, very merry Christmas, we say Merry Christmas, again, very, very proudly. Very, very merry Christmas. We\u2019re going to have a great year, an incredible year. I\u2019m thrilled to bring seasons greetings on behalf of the first lady and our entire family and most importantly, on behalf of the American people.\u201d He then told \u201cthe wonderful people of the media. Enjoy yourselves. Really appreciate it, have a great Christmas\u201d. The president then departed for a round of golf at the Trump International Golf Club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
