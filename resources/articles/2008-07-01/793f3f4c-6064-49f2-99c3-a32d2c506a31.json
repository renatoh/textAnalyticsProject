However, his set at Cup - accompanied by an acoustic guitar and a fabulous vocalist, Joy Malcolm - is one of various quirky dates to promote his new Last Night album, a back-to-roots dance affair. \"Last night we played an acoustic set at Ruby's,\" he begins. \"Was anybody there?\" Silence. \"Uh, nobody was there.\" In heavy-rimmed spectacles, he cuts more of a Woody Allen figure than techno head these days, the delightfully absurd incongruity of this event helped by cartoon smiley teapots on the wall. \"When Joy sings it's fantastic,\" says Mr Moby, in front of Mr Teapot. \"When I do, it's a good time to go to the toilet.\" The latter is palpably untrue, but there is an air of Forrest Gump as he relates the experiences success allowed him, such as singing Walk On the Wild Side with Lou Reed in front of America's elite. \"When we reached the line about 'giving head', Senator John Kerry looked horrified,\" he grins. \"His wife looked strangely turned on.\" But Moby tired of the emptiness of the celebrity whirl and has become a withering mimic of famous people's conversations. Success has afforded him the freedom to do whatever he wants, whether that's tearing into Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire or delivering a vastly reworked Porcelain and Disco Lies. With people beating their teacups, he turns old smash Honey into an epic blues jam and back again - probably the nearest a veggie tea room will come to the rave experience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
