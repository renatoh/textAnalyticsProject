And Blair is", "bodyText": "It is always best to face up to your demons, but it is human nature to put off the moment of confrontation as long as possible. In this, politicians are no different from anyone else. Bill Clinton's career is the locus classicus of modern times. But Charles Kennedy's long reluctance to look at his bleary-eyed self in the mirror is another obvious example. And Tony Blair's latest prevarication over his departure date from office is a third. But, as Charles Clarke says in the New Statesman this week, political parties also avoid their demons. Even under David Cameron, the Tory party still cannot bring itself to say anything true or useful about issues involving Europe. Perhaps the high-level leadership cover-up over Kennedy's alcoholism may at last resolve the Liberal Democrats to be a tad less smug about the realities of politics - but don't hold your breath. Labour's problem is that too much of it remains half-hearted about the New Labour revolution that has brought it three terms in office. Too many Labourites find it too difficult to reconcile their collectivist instincts with individualist realities in the form of a programme they care about. As a result, as Clarke says, there is a tendency to evade the hard questions in favour of easier surrogate issues, such as the party leadership and even the deputy leadership. That, it seems to me, is precisely where the party, drifting slowly towards possible defeat, is this autumn. Labour's problem with itself certainly owes something to the strength of \"old\" Labour traditions. The late Henry Drucker's insight that Labour is a party animated more by a sense of collective ethos than by a commitment to a political programme - and that it is therefore more comfortable as a party of opposition, sustained by a sense of betrayal, than as a party of government - is being vindicated afresh in these declining days of the most successful period of rule in the party's history. But it is neither true nor honest to ignore \"new\" Labour's own role in the drift. Clarke is bravely to the point here. Too much of the process of public-service reform, he writes (and he includes reforms of which he himself has had charge), has been decreed from on high (by Gordon Brown as by Blair) in the shape of a white paper, a bill, a speech, a newspaper interview - or even, as Clarke points out in relation to nuclear power and Trident, in brief asides. Too little of the process has focused on sustained nourishing of (and then listening and responding to) real debate, or on creating cultures or structures of partnership. One might add that too many of the things most controversially associated with New Labour in power - targets, management consultants, spin-doctoring, rebranding and the rest of it - also crept into the Labour government's DNA without debate or even announcement. After nearly a decade in power, this is therefore a party, not a leadership, crisis. Overall, there is no doubt that the New Labour approach has slowly alienated support - Clarke writes of five important fault lines - that might have been retained by doing things more openly and carefully. And it has handed more influence to the visceral opponents of change than they deserve. In a smaller way, a very similar approach has also caused avoidable problems over the leadership-succession issue itself. Yet unless and until Labour can follow the path indicated by Clarke, much of the talk of renewal in office will ring hollow. How is this necessary process to happen without Labour going into opposition? It has to be doubtful how far a new leader can, of himself, generate such a process. The party's natural reflex under a new leader will surely be discipline rather than disruption. And since even Brown's most fervent admirers would not seriously pretend that openness to debate and self-criticism rank high among his many qualifications to be Labour's leader, it seems illogical that a leadership change should precede, rather than emerge from, a period of renewal debate. Ironic (and even insufferable) though it may seem to his critics, the forthcoming period of weak, terminal leadership under Blair actually offers a much better space for this necessary kind of Labour renewal than the period of strong new leadership under Brown - the more so since Blair seems so keen for it to happen. If Labour knew what was good for it, therefore, it would cut Blair some slack in the handover process, in its own (and Brown's) interests rather than his. There are three options for Blair's departure. He can go now. He can go with a timetable. Or he can hang on and then pick his moment. He shows no sign of choosing the first path. The tactical problem, much exacerbated by yesterday's Times interview and the inevitable harrumphing that it has caused, is that Blair has in fact chosen the second path, a timetable, while continuing to give the impression to the world at large that he is following the third, going on and on. The Blairites resent this conclusion. They say Blair has a plan. He intends to go in summer 2007. He will make an announcement of his resignation date before the spring elections. He has shared his plan in detail with Brown. Everyone else more or less knows this is the case anyway. To the Blairites, this means that the plan is out there and fully consistent (self-sacrificingly so in some eyes) with his \"no fourth-term\" announcement before the last election, and with his promise to Labour MPs in May to give his successor plenty of time to shape the run-in to the next general election. The one thing he can't do is give a precise advance date, because that would terminate his authority. Read the Times interview and that is indeed what he is saying. The trouble with this is twofold. First, it guarantees that the leadership, rather than the party, becomes the issue when Labour gathers in Manchester in three weeks' time. This makes Blair's position look more unreasonable than it is. Second, Blair's authority is already slipping away anyway, even declining \"by the day\", as a very senior Blairite admitted to me this week. He must learn to let go. Confronting one's demons means being honest. Clinton wasn't. Nor was Kennedy. Blair can do better. He has the ability to turn this around. He should make clear now that this is his last party conference and leave it at that. His Manchester speech, which needs to be a corker, should be dedicated to mending Clarke's fault lines and to setting out a vision of the party he is handing on. And Brown should call off the dogs and let him do it. He owes it to Blair - and it is in his own self-interest. As Burke said, magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom. martin.kettle@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
