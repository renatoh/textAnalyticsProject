Smart as a box of frogs", "bodyText": "Today\u2019s puzzles are taken from Mathigon, a wonderful interactive mathematical encyclopaedia. Every year, the site publishes a puzzle a day from Dec 1 to 24. Here are three of my favourites from this year. Jump to it! Keeping in the festive spirit, I have a signed copy of my new book, So You Think You\u2019ve Got Problems?* to give away. To win it, I\u2019d like you to write a sentence about Christmas of at least seven words in which the only vowel used is an \u2018a\u2019. Here\u2019s an example: At Xmas, Santa bangs lampstand and rants. Please email or Tweet me your entries, thanks! You\u2019ve got until just before 5pm UK time today. I\u2019m looking for some \u2018haha\u2019, \u2018aha!\u2019 and \u2018ta-dah!\u2019. (And, to clarify, don\u2019t use \u2018y\u2019 when it is used as a vowel, as in \u2018happy\u2019, \u2018says\u2019 etc.) I\u2019ll be back at 5pm, when I\u2019ll post the winner and the best entries, as well as the answers for today\u2019s puzzles. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS please. UPDATE: solutions and the winning sentence can be read here. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me. * So You Think You\u2019ve Got Problems? is the perfect Christmas present for a puzzle-lover, sorry, I mean it is a compendium of 200 or so puzzles together with historical and mathematical background. The puzzles span wordplay, logic, geometry, linguistics, topology and many other fields. It\u2019s for all abilities: there are very simple teasers that children will be able to do and utterly baffling ones for only the sharpest minds. Thanks to Philipp Legner of Mathigon for today\u2019s puzzles. The first one originally appeared in the Netherlands Junior Mathematics Olympiad. The other two are of unknown origin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
