The more so when their replacements were smaller men, less physically equipped to repel the bombardment that would inevitably have ensued. That those days are in the past is not a source of regret to the majority of Bolton supporters but there must have been more than a few who wondered why the manager, Owen Coyle, left it until the hour to introduce Kevin Davies. By the time he did so Norwich City had regained the momentum which had seen them dominate the first period and come within an inch of opening the scoring when Andrew Surman drove against the underside of the bar with only the goalkeeper Adam Bogdan to beat from six yards. Bolton's only threat was coming from the shooting and set-ball deliveries of Martin Petrov and it was no more than Norwich deserved when first Surman made up for his earlier profligacy by volleying past Bogdan after his initial shot was blocked and then Anthony Pilkington turned home the rebound after Bogdan had blocked Russell Martin's shot. Coyle, while disappointed that his team had been unable to find the form which had seen them pick up 11 points from their previous seven games, offered no apologies. \"When Kevin Davies came on he won every header and looked a threat but the problem was we didn't defend well enough to keep Norwich out and ultimately that was the tale of the game,\" he said. So it was and that Bolton had offered so little going forward should not detract from a City performance which was far more typical of their season than the uncharacteristically poor showing at Sunderland last Wednesday. The manner in which his players had picked themselves up prompted their manager Paul Lambert to describe Saturday as possibly the best showing in his time in charge at Carrow Road. On a bitter afternoon both Daniel Ayala and Zak Whitbread suffered hamstring injuries but Lambert brought on Martin for Ayala and switched Kyle Naughton from right-back to partner him when Whitbread followed. \"It's a blow losing two of your big lads because Bolton are a big side but Russell Martin and Kyle Naughton and then Elliott Bennett \u2013 a right winger playing right-back \u2013 were really brilliant,\" Lambert said. Bennett was matter of fact. \"We reorganised, we regained control of the game, we did what we started off doing, peppering them, and we managed to get two goals. We were all really disappointed with our performance on Wednesday but the gaffer told us to put it right here and I think we did that.\" The win takes Norwich to 32 points with 12 games remaining and on this bright, determined and effective showing, very few would not back them to stay up with plenty to spare. Bolton's fate is certain to remain in the balance for rather longer, Wolverhampton Wanderers' win at Queens Park Rangers meaning Coyle's team is back in the bottom three. \"We know we have good players and a good team and that at our best we can win games, as we've seen in recent matches,\" Coyle said. \"We've signed [striker] Marvin Sordell [from Watford] and he came on in the last 10 minutes and showed glimpses of what he can do, but we already have good strikers. Marvin adds to that strength.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
