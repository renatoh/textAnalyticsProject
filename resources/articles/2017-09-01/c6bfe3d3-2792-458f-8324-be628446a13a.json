Slightly weakened after hitting Cuba but still packing an enormously powerful punch, effects of the storm that has claimed more than 20 lives during a week-long 185mph rampage across the Caribbean reached deep into the Sunshine State by late afternoon. The centre of the category 4 storm was predicted to make landfall in the Florida Keys, the vulnerable low-lying island chain off the state\u2019s southern coast, in the early hours of Sunday. But the outer bands of a storm that Florida governor Rick Scott warned was \u201cwider than the entire state\u201d lashed coastal and inland areas through the day, sparking tornado warnings and widespread loss of power. At an early evening briefing, Scott said: \u201cIf you\u2019re in an area that was told to evacuate, you need to leave now. This is your last chance to make a good decision.\u201d He added: \u201cMillions of Floridians will see life-threatening winds beginning tonight,\u201d with the \u201csignificant threat of serious storm surge along the whole west coast of Florida.\u201d A storm surge of 15ft would be \u201cdevastating and will cover your house\u201d, Scott said. \u201cDo not think the storm is over when the wind slows down. The storm surge will rush in and it could kill you.\u201d Scott recalled a storm some years ago that brought 6ft storm surges into Naples, on the west coast, and the breathtaking speed of the water that crashed into homes. It was hard to describe, he said, \u201chow fast the water moved in and how fast the water moved out\u201d. \u201cThat was six feet,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just think about \u2013 how can anybody survive this stuff? I just want everybody to live.\u201d The projected track of Irma took it up the west coast of Florida during Sunday and in line for a direct hit on the 3 million residents of the Tampa Bay area early on Monday, still as a major hurricane with sustained winds of greater than 140mph. A tornado watch was issued for all of southern Florida. Radar images of Irma over Cuba\u2019s northern coast showed that the storm\u2019s core had been disrupted by its interaction with land, raising hopes its power could be diminished. But later data showed it regaining shape as it moved back into the warm, open waters of the Florida Straits. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that as it eases away from Cuba it will strengthen again,\u201d said Max Mayfield, a former director of the National Hurricane Center (NHC). \u201cThe core of the hurricane, where the really devastating winds are going to be, is going to move right over the lower Florida Keys early tomorrow morning, and then likely another landfall somewhere on the south-west Florida coast.\u201d The restrengthening was confirmed by the NHC\u2019s late-afternoon advisory, which forecast a category 4 hurricane at landfall. The agency had earlier adjusted the projected track of Irma\u2019s centre further west, away from Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in the south east, home to more than 6 million people. But NHC specialist Lixion Avila warned that hurricane force winds stretched more than 70 miles from Irma\u2019s centre and that no part of Florida was out of danger. \u201cThere is an imminent danger of life-threatening storm surge flooding in portions of central and southern Florida, including the Florida Keys,\u201d he said. \u201cIrma is expected to bring life-threatening wind and storm surge to the Florida Keys and south-western Florida as an extremely dangerous major hurricane.\u201d All but deserted from a mandatory evacuation order, the near sea-level Florida Keys island chain was expected to be inundated by up to 15ft of water. Officials reported that the mass evacuation of millions of residents of coastal and vulnerable areas close to inland water had mostly gone smoothly, despite shortages of fuel and gridlock on major highways. \u201cVery few cars are out there, citizens have taken evacuation warnings very seriously, our shelters are beginning to get full,\u201d said Scott Israel, sheriff of Broward County, where a 4pm curfew was ordered. By late afternoon, however, the northbound I-75 near Ocala was gridlocked. Further north in Georgia, another half-million residents were told to evacuate. Although Irma is forecast to weaken as it travels north over land, authorities in Georgia and Alabama urged residents to be on alert for heavy rains, wind and flooding as early as Monday. Across Florida, close to 100,000 customers had lost power by late Saturday, most of them in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Crews worked to restore about half of them before strengthening winds made it too dangerous to work. The number of outages was expected to grow. In Miami-Dade county, almost 50,000 were without power. Carlos Gimenez, the mayor, said: \u201cThere have been rumours about Miami-Dade being in the clear, being safe. Let me make this clear, Miami-Dade is still being affected by Irma and there are already reports of hurricane force gusts. A serious storm is coming our way and will be here through Sunday.\u201d In Miami, the streets were virtually empty by Saturday morning, with all petrol stations, supermarkets and other commercial outlets closed. The city was in a state of foreboding, waiting to find out what nature had in store. In St Petersburg, near Tampa, shelves were bare of essentials \u2013 bleach, soup, beans and bread. In one branch of the Publix supermarket, deliveries of ice were announced on a loud speaker with a two-bag maximum per person. Cases of water were also limited to two per person. Every shopper had water. Nearly all had beer. As the storm approached, people on the western edge of the bay in Pinellas County scrambled to get ready for likely 110mph sustained winds. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having press conferences two or three times a day trying to get people informed, to get them to evacuate,\u201d said Pat Gerard, a county commissioner. \u201cOf course they\u2019re not doing it, but it\u2019s just what they do.\u201d The last seriously destructive storm to hit Tampa Bay was in 1921, a category 3 hurricane that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) called the \u201cforgotten nightmare\u201d. Around the county, many said they were making last-minute preparations to for the storm. Putting plywood on windows, charging phones, stocking propane, gas, water and food. Irma claimed its first fatality in Florida on Friday when a 57-year-old man fell attempting to put up hurricane shutters on a second-story window. Late on Saturday Donald Trump issued a video of his remarks at a cabinet meeting at Camp David, in Maryland. \u201cThis is a storm of enormous destructive power,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cI ask everyone in the storm\u2019s path to heed ALL instructions from government officials.\u201d In the morning, Governor Scott said he had \u201ctalked to President Trump, he has promised all federal resources [and] I\u2019ve talked to Brock Long, who runs [the Federal Emergency Management Agency], this morning, and he\u2019s guaranteed us all federal resources. \u201cFlorida\u2019s tough, Florida\u2019s resilient and Florida\u2019s unbreakable. This is a great state and we\u2019re going to come out of this very strong.\u201d The foreign office has a hotline for Britons affected by Hurricane Irma in the United States and the Caribbean: +44 207 008 0000"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
