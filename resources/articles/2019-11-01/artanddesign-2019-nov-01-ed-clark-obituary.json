In doing so, Clark came to be regarded as the first American artist to have created a shaped painting, in which the composition breaks free of the medium\u2019s traditional rectangle \u2013 one of several artistic innovations he made during a seven-decade career. The piece he created was an abstract, expressionistic composition of red, white, blue and green, interrupted by two torn sheets of paper painted in similar hues, overlaid on the canvas and dramatically hanging over the top and right edge of the frame. \u201cI looked at it and looked at it and looked at it, and I thought it had a punch,\u201d Clark recalled in 2014. The painting won immediate praise when it was exhibited in 1958 at the artist-run Brata gallery in New York. \u201cUp and down, over and across, forward and backward \u2013 one is always aware of the canvas edge as a positive element,\u201d wrote the poet James Schuyler, then a critic at Art News. \u201cClark is a craftsman; he has a control over his means.\u201d Clark went on to create a series of vast oval-shaped works, typically featuring thickly applied swathes of different coloured paint running in horizontal parallel. The shape, he said, was a reference to the eye. In 1956, while in Paris, Clark had started to use a broom to paint, laying the canvas on the studio floor and pushing a block of pigment across its surface with considerable force. The technique, to which he would return time and again, produced abstract paintings in which the broom strokes demonstrate a strength of movement and energy unobtainable with a brush. For much of his career, Clark was an artist\u2019s artist, appreciated and supported by fellow abstract painters and members of the New York School. In 1979 he was included in an exhibition at Louisiana State University and in 1981 he had a solo show at the Studio Museum in Harlem, but his success was for many years mainly within artist co-operatives and smaller commercial galleries. In 1993, however, the Studio Museum included his work in 25 Years of African-American Abstraction, the first of several group exhibitions there that Clark participated in. His belated big break came in 2014 when his fellow artist David Hammons curated a solo show of his work at Tilton gallery in New York. Tilton showed more paintings in 2017, the year Clark\u2019s work was included in Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power at Tate Modern, in London, an exhibition that is still touring internationally. In 2018 the Mnuchin gallery, New York, held a retrospective of works from 1962 to 2013, and earlier this year Hauser &amp; Wirth, who are currently exhibiting later works at their New York gallery, began representing him. Ed was born in New Orleans to Merion (nee Hutchinson), a seamstress, and Edward Clark, who worked at Western Electric and on the railways, but also made money gambling. When Ed was six, the family moved to a house in Baton Rouge that had an outside toilet and no electricity, before relocating to Chicago, to the area of Woodlawn, described by Clark as \u201ca nice neighbourhood for high-class black people\u201d. His father was absent for days on end and, despite his mother\u2019s best efforts, the family were evicted. Clark went to Englewood high school and then Moseley school, leaving aged 17 to enlist in the US Army Air Corps for second world war service. He was shipped out to Guam and Saipan in the western Pacific, but saw no action and returned to Chicago. Dyslexic but with a talent for drawing, Clark enrolled at the city\u2019s Art Institute in 1947. During his four years of study, his teacher, the impressionist painter Louis Ritman, proved inspirational: Clark recalled that it was from him he learned how colours could change dramatically when juxtaposed. A self-portrait made in his first year there, showing a handsome Clark staring sullenly out to the viewer, demonstrates an early awareness of palette. On being told that Paris was the centre of the art world, in 1952 Clark applied to the Academie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in Montparnasse and, using the money received from the GI Bill, a fund to benefit ex-service personnel, bought a passage to France on the SS Libert\u00e9. Arriving in the city he recalled: \u201cIt must have been nine at night when I got out. I looked to my right and it was all lit up. I just walked towards the light \u2013 somebody I studied with was sitting at Cafe du D\u00f4me. You could see anybody. Giacometti would be at the cafe every night.\u201d Clark fell easily into bohemian society, mixing with fellow African-American artists and writers also in Paris, including Beauford Delaney, James Baldwin and Haywood Bill Rivers, as well as Europeans. At the Salon d\u2019Automne he saw one of Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl\u2019s football paintings, semi-abstract works of bright colour showing a match in play, which had a profound effect on his own art. He experimented first with a series of geometric expressionist still lifes, and then took up the broom, a technique he dubbed \u201cthe big sweep\u201d. One early work from 1960, titled Blue Force, features a great slick of blue paint driving through splashes of red and turquoise. Clark had solo shows in Paris at Galerie Raymond Creuze in 1955, which sold well, and 1956, which did not. Desperately poor, but attractive and charismatic, he survived by the generosity of various women. \u201cI was never a gigolo, but they\u2019d be living with me,\u201d he said. In 1957 Clark returned to New York, where he showed at the Brata, and continued to make work while earning cash as an assistant at the Sidney Janis gallery, then the centre of the New York School showing artists such as Mark Rothko. The latter passed the young Clark his old canvases to use. In 1966 Clark married Hedy Durham, the third of his four wives, and in 1968 the couple spent the year at the French house of the American painter Joan Mitchell, in V\u00e9theuil, near Paris, a palatial spot with gardens backing down to the Seine. It was there that Clark began to experiment with oval canvases. In 1969 he showed his work at the American embassy in Paris. Back in New York, Clark received a national endowment grant in 1972, a year after Donald Judd had given him a solo exhibition at his loft on Spring Street. He continued to paint and exhibit, and his work is held in collections across the US, including Moma and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Clark was married four times, to Muriel Nelson, Lola Owens, Durham, with whom he had a daughter, Melanca, and Liping An; each marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by Melanca and two grandchildren. \u2022 Ed Clark, artist, born 6 May 1926; died 18 October 2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
