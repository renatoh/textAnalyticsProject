The demand for food aid has increased as much as eightfold in some areas, according to an investigation by the Guardian, which gives a nationwide snapshot of the hunger crisis facing the US as millions become unemployed. About one in three people seeking groceries at not-for-profit pantries last month have never previously needed emergency food aid, according to interviews with a dozen providers across the country. The national guard has been deployed to help food banks cope with rising demand in cities including Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Phoenix amid growing concerns that supplies may run low as the crisis evolves. Overstretched food pantries are switching to drive-thrus and home deliveries to minimize the spread of Covid-19 as almost 300 million Americans are urged to stay at home. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this business over 30 years, and nothing compares to what we\u2019re seeing now. Not even when the steel mills closed down did we see increased demand like this,\u201d said Sheila Christopher, director of Hunger-Free Pennsylvania, which represents 18 food banks across 67 counties. Last year, 4.3bn meals were distributed to more than 40 million Americans through a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 pantries, schools, soup kitchens and shelters, according to Feeding America, the national food bank network. The working poor, elderly and disabled and infirm accounted for the vast majority of food bank users. This week, the Guardian contacted food banks and pantries in nine states, which all reported unprecedented demand, plummeting donations from retailers, and a fall in personnel due to the coronavirus crisis. In Amherst, home to the University of Massachusetts\u2019 largest campus, the pantry distributed 849% more food in March compared with the previous year. The second-largest increase in western Massachusetts was 748% at the Pittsfield Salvation Army pantry. The Grace Klein community food pantry in Jefferson county, which has the largest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Alabama, provided 5,076 individuals with food boxes last week \u2013 a 90% increase on the previous week. In southern Arizona, demand has doubled, with pantries supplying groceries to 4,000 households every day \u2013 double the number supplied in March 2019. \u201cWe saw an increase during the federal government shutdown but nothing as rapid, massive or overwhelming as this,\u201d said Michael McDonald, CEO of the Community Food Bank of South Arizona. A helpline set up by the Greater Pittsburgh community food bank has received more than a thousand calls in the past two weeks, 90% of which came from newly unemployed people. Here, pantries ordered 50% to 60% more food for March and April than usual. The Lakeview pantry in Chicago is on track to provide food for as many as 2,000 individuals this week \u2013 compared with 1,100 before the coronavirus crisis. The north Florida food bank, which relied heavily on contributions from retailers, has seen donations drop by 85% to 90% as shoppers bulk-buy, leaving shelves empty. But donations from restaurants, golf tournaments and even Disney World have increased, so the food bank is switching to ready meals, paying furloughed chefs to cook for thousands of senior citizens in housing facilities. In Las Vegas, the Three Square food bank has increased weekly food distribution by 30%, from 1m to 1.3m lbs of food. New drive-thru distribution centres have been set up across the valley as 170 of its 180 distribution outlets have been forced to temporarily close due to CDC social distancing guidelines. \u201cEvery line at every distribution centre exceeds the amount of food in our trucks,\u201d said chief operating officer Larry Scott. The Kansas City-based Harvesters food bank, which serves 16 counties in north-east Kansas and 10 in north-west Missouri, sent out 12,000 boxes to pantries on Monday 23 March \u2013 a 140% rise on the 5,000 boxes typically ordered. \u201cIt was the largest distribution day in our 40-year history,\u201d said its communications manager, Gene Hallinan. This snapshot is representative of the national picture, according to Feeding America. \u201cThis is a perfect storm impacting food banking as we know it,\u201d said a spokeswoman, Zuani Villarreal. On Tuesday, Cleveland police and the Ohio national guard helped load boxes of groceries into cars at a new drive-thru pick-up service located in the huge downtown municipal car park. At least 2,765 families were provided with a week\u2019s groceries \u2013 36% of them first-timers \u2013 compared with 1,500 at a similar event last week, when the queue stretched almost three miles. A cab driver, single mother who worked in hospitality and freelance photographer were among those requesting help for the first time. The rust belt states are among the hardest hit by the coronavirus economic crisis. More than 187,000 Ohioans filed for unemployment benefits during the third week of March when businesses were closed by the governor \u2013 an extraordinary increase on the 7,046 claims filed the previous week, according to the Department of Labor. The Greater Cleveland food bank received 800 calls to its helpline during one day last week \u2013 eight times the usual number. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it in over 20 years of service. We\u2019re seeing people from every socio-economic level because the majority of Americans live paycheck to paycheck,\u201d said the food bank\u2019s CEO, Kristin Warzocha. Half of American adults have either no emergency savings or not enough to cover three months of living expenses, according to Bankrate\u2019s 2019 Financial Security Index. Demand tripled There was a similar dramatic scene in Phoenix, Arizona, where 1,500 people queued up for food boxes at the St Mary\u2019s main office \u2013 compared with 450 just two weeks ago. Here, the national guard is also pitching in at the makeshift drive-thru centre as volunteer numbers have plummeted from 250 a day to less than 50, as the vast majority are senior citizens advised to stay home to minimize the risk of Covid-19. In total, St Mary\u2019s \u2013 the oldest known food bank in the world \u2013 supplies 700 pantries, shelters, churches and social service centres in seven counties where one in five children struggle with hunger. \u201cFirst we saw people who lived paycheck to paycheck, got laid off and didn\u2019t know where the next meal was coming from, followed by those who had a couple of weeks of savings. Now, people who knew about us because they donated or volunteered are coming in for food,\u201d said Jerry Brown, media spokesman for St Mary\u2019s. \u201cThe 2008 recession doesn\u2019t touch this. It\u2019s a different ballgame.\u201d Before the coronavirus pandemic, about 37 million, or one in eight, Americans could not always access enough nutritional food to lead healthy, active lives. Food insecurity forces families to make tradeoffs between basic needs such as housing, medical bills and food, and many do not qualify for federal nutrition programs. The government rescue packages include some measures to help alleviate food insecurity such as expanding eligibility for food stamps, increasing commodities donations from the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and providing $1,200 to every American earning under $99,000. But experts warn that help has been slow, patchy and inadequate so far. \u201cPhilanthropy and not-for-profits are not going to be able to meet food demands. The government needs to step in,\u201d said Kellie O\u2019Connell, chief executive of the Lakeview pantry in Chicago. Caitlin Welsh, director of global food security at the Washington based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: \u201cThe supply chain is strong but as the number of food insecure people increases continuously, we\u2019ll perhaps need a new wave of federal legislation directed specifically at household food security. \u201cThese numbers show that the pandemic is causing economic shocks never experienced in our lifetime.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
