Successful on his last two starts over fences, Liberty Seeker (4.15) has the assistance of Paul Hanagan in a 1m7f handicap which will not take a lot of winning. Manaar (3.45), who figures among the entries for Saturday's totesport International Handicap, should enjoy a confidence boosting victory. He ran his best race for a long time when touched off by True Night at Ascot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
