Seeing Placido Domingo as Cavaradossi in Tosca at Covent Garden when I was 14. I didn't know who he was, but I thought he was magical in every way. What was your big breakthrough? Opera Factory's 1994 production of The Rake's Progress. It was a very important showcase for me. Who or what have you sacrificed for your art? Opera is a sacrificial lifestyle, but I came to terms with that early on. You can't reap the benefits and then beat yourself up over it. Are you fashionable? More classic than high fashion. Frankly, at under five foot, I'm grateful to find something that fits. What music would feature on the soundtrack to your life? A medley including Somewhere Over the Rainbow, The Man I Love, and Patience by Take That. If someone saw one of your performances in 1,000 years' time, what would it tell them about the year 2007? That, despite our socially and politically disruptive times, we are still coming together to draw upon the all-encompassing live experience of opera. Have you done anything cultural lately? Last week, I had a private tour of Compton Verney art gallery with my old art teacher from school. I saw the beauty of the building itself for the first time. What's your favourite film? I love the original Star Wars trilogy. As a kid of 10, I was amazed by their sheer spectacle, and I fell in love with Harrison Ford. What's your favourite museum? The Museum of Modern Art in New York. You come off bustling Fifth Avenue and enter this lovely quiet space. What's the greatest threat to opera today? The Arts Council. They know how little they do to help us. Do you suffer for your art? Yes, emotionally and physically. Opera is a demanding form, but that's fine by me. What advice would you give a young singer just starting out? Maintain your integrity and humility. What cultural tip would you give to a tourist about Britain's arts scene? Look up; art is everywhere - in the street as well as in the obvious buildings. What work of art would you most like to own? The Head of Christ by El Greco. Christ's upturned face has a questioning look, and also seems amazingly peaceful. Complete this sentence: At heart I'm just a frustrated ... Movie star. What's the best advice anyone ever gave you? My friend's husband once told me it's far better to be thin-skinned than not to feel anything at all. That way, at least you have sensitivity. What cultural form leaves you cold or confused? Reality TV. I'm completely baffled as to the point of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
