I had a hip flask in my inside pocket, not a Walther PPK. And I had a profuse nosebleed. No wonder my James Bond cover was quickly blown. Unless you are a devastatingly handsome spy, nosebleeds are an occupational hazard in the Bernese Oberland region of Switzerland. Especially at the Piz Gloria, where customers regularly arrive starving for oxygen as well as sauerkraut. It probably has less atmosphere than any other restaurant in Europe. Mainly because it is the highest in continental Europe at 3,000m. But visitors make the 7km cable-car journey from Stechelberg via Gimmelwald and M\u00fcrren not for the ultimate haute-cuisine experience; they come because, for many, it is a place of pilgrimage. Mount Schilthorn is for Bond fans what the Reichenbach Falls are to Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts. In 1969, it was used as the alpine hideaway of Telly Savalas, aka Ernst Stavro Blofeld, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, operating as a fictional spa and research clinic for single and attractive young women suffering from serious allergies and various degrees of chronic but treatable nymphomania. As soon as I arrived at Blofeld's mountaintop hideaway, my dress sense was questioned by a waiter called Georges, who claimed to be Croatia's biggest Bond fan. \"If you want a beautiful young lady to write the name of her room number on the inside of your thigh with lipstick, you should be wearing a kilt,\" he said with great seriousness. \"And real Bond fans never book a table for lunch under their real name. They always use Sir Hilary Bray, which was the name 007 used to infiltrate Piz Gloria.\" He paused to study my face for Bond knowledge. \"Sir Hilary Bray,\" he repeated. \"From the College of Arms and Heralds.\" Assuming ignorance, he pointed to a wall on which hung a coat of arms. I looked at it with my head tilted back. \"It was from here that Blofeld planned to take over the world. He would have succeeded if it hadn't been for Mister Bond.\" I was taken to my table and given a map showing which mountains could be seen from the rotating restaurant. Two hundred peaks passed in front of my table in the next 20 minutes. \"Some days you can see as far as the Black Forest,\" Georges informed me when he returned with a complimentary vodka martini, shaken not stirred. \"We also do Bond breakfasts: bacon, egg, potato and a selection of blondes and brunettes.\" By which he meant toast. In the restaurant, there was also an absence of bald men without ear lobes - the Blofeld family trait. But there was a party of Bond enthusiasts. This group of four people were getting into the part, having chosen the goulash soup for the realistic blood stains it makes in the middle of the chest. I asked them where they were from. \"The Netherlands,\" they replied. \"They filmed Diamonds Are Forever there,\" one said, rather proudly. \"We are on a male-Bonding holiday,\" said another, without a smile. He flicked his cigarette lighter. I ducked. \"We have been to St Petersburg, Venice, Vietnam, Las Vegas, Fort Knox, the Oh Cult Voodoo Shop in Manhattan, and Scaramanga's Island in Thailand. We want to go to Cairo next. Or New Orleans. To see Dr Kananga's lair. And the Filet of Soul.\" \"I've been to The Monsoon Palace in India,\" I said, referring to the Lake Palace in Udaipur, where Octopussy was filmed. Somehow, boasting that I had been to Vauxhall to see the headquarters of M16 didn't have the same air of exotic mystique. But the Dutch gave me semi-appreciative nods all the same. Rather surprisingly, given the massive fan base, there are no organised Bond tours or themed holidays, so you have to plan visits to the film locations yourself. The Eiffel tower, Gibraltar, Stoke Poges (where Bond played golf against Goldfinger), the Golden Gate bridge and the other American locations are the most obvious and the easiest to get to. Naturally, the Bahamas are very popular, too. Four Bond films were shot there. You can visit Stuart Cove, where Sean Connery learned to dive, or swim around the Tears of Allah shipwreck, where he grappled with a shark and see the Vulcan bomber used in Thunderball, as well as Rock Point House where Roger Moore drove his amphibious Lotus out of the water in The Spy Who Loved Me. Most Bond buffs already know the locations of the next Bond film, Die Another Day, and are visiting places such as The Eden Project in Cornwall and the Vatnajokull glacier in Iceland. As they left, I asked them where they were off to next and found out that it was the Verzasca dam - also in Switzerland - which features at the beginning of Goldeneye. For the next 10 minutes, I watched their cable car swinging down the mountainside and into depths of the Lauterbrunnen Valley. And it didn't explode. \u00b7 Die Another Day opens nationwide next Friday.
