From moment to moment, they face harrowing life-and-death encounters and constantly risk their own safety to help an overwhelming number of people of a variety of ages and backgrounds who are \u201ceffectively drowning on dry land\u201d from Covid-19. \u201cEvery single 12-hour shift I work is like nothing I\u2019ve ever endured,\u201d said Lynn, a nurse at Pascack Valley Medical Center in Westwood, northern New Jersey. She has worked in the field for more than three decades, and describes the current state of the ICU as \u201ca war zone\u201d. The patients are \u201csicker than I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d, she says. They can crash in the blink of an eye, then slip into multiple organ failure. Like many other medical professionals across the US, she does not want her full name published. She is afraid of retaliation from the hospital where she works for speaking out on the conditions inside her unit. But she said she feels beat up from working so hard, and is alarmed by the grim outcomes for her patients. \u201cWhat you see on TV you can pretty much times by ten,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d New York is the US state worst affected by the coronavirus outbreak so far, but its neighbour, New Jersey, is not far behind. The state had more than 51,000 cases and 1,700 people had died as of Thursday afternoon, a stunning toll on a population of less than 9 million people. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed across New Jersey, but the north, where many New York city commuters live, has been particularly hard hit. That is especially true in Bergen county, which has seen the fourth-highest number of coronavirus deaths of any county in the US, according to Johns Hopkins, and is where Pascack Valley Medical Center is located. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy has said he believes the state\u2019s curve for new coronavirus cases has begun to flatten. Even so, \u201cthe fatalities are going up, and sadly will continue to go up\u201d, he said Wednesday as he announced the deaths of New Jersey residents who were infected weeks ago. Though there are signs of hope, New Jersey hospitals are still currently struggling. On Thursday, more than 7,360 people were hospitalized in the state because of Covid-19, and healthcare workers on the frontlines said the vast majority of their patients now have the disease. Though hospital staff are coping to the best of their abilities, Lynn says just at her hospital alone, it would require hundreds more nurses as reinforcements to be able to deal properly with such dire need. Hackensack Meridian Health, which operates the Westwood facility, did not return repeated requests for a comment for this article. An emergency room doctor in northern New Jersey, who also feared retaliation and asked to remain anonymous, said his hospital has a similar caseload to Elmhurst Hospital, one of the hardest hit in New York City. Before the outbreak, it wasn\u2019t unusual if one patient lost their pulse and needed chest compressions to stay alive. But during a recent shift, he was faced with three such situations, back-to-back. \u201cFor whatever reason, folks are holding up, holding up, holding up, and then almost before your eyes over the course of minutes to an hour will suddenly decompensate in a way that few things that we deal with in the emergency room do,\u201d he said. He describes how one 48-year-old patient\u2019s oxygen levels dropped catastrophically low. The doctor rushed in without full personal protective equipment (PPE) so he could insert a breathing tube into the man\u2019s airway, even as his patient was coughing up the virus. An hour later, the doctor was on the phone with his patient\u2019s daughter to update her on her father\u2019s condition. He was grateful he had avoided a much more difficult call by making the choice he did, regardless of personal risk. \u201cThe choice is stop and put on all your PPE, which can take a minute or two, or get on the most important stuff, and get in there and save his life,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cNot to be dramatic about it, but that quite literally was the choice that I felt I was faced with.\u201d In another case, a 400-pound man with Covid symptoms started throwing punches at hospital staff as his breathing began to fail. His carbon dioxide levels were too high, and he likely didn\u2019t know who he was or where he was, much less who other people around him were. The doctor had no idea how he and other staff members would help the man without risking exposure to the disease themselves. He said he thinks his hospital and New Jersey\u2019s state government are doing the best they can in the circumstances, but is frustrated with the federal government, and especially Donald Trump, for minimizing the disease\u2019s seriousness and creating what he believes are unrealistic expectations around available resources as well as how long this pandemic will last. \u201cAll of that as an emergency room doctor has made my work harder, not easier, and it\u2019s made it harder in ways that are very tangible,\u201d he said. He describes walking into a shift weeks ago, when he quickly realized that within two hours of the president going on television and saying testing was readily available \u2013 even though it wasn\u2019t \u2013 somewhere between 40 and 60 patients had flooded into his emergency room looking for tests. Tests haven\u2019t been the only tools in short supply. Lynn said she and her colleagues have been using the same face shields for up to a week, and they\u2019re out of bleach wipes to disinfect their once disposable equipment. \u201cThey\u2019re one time use, and up until a month ago, I would have been disciplined for using them more than once,\u201d Lynn said. Jane, another registered nurse who works in the ICU at Pascack Valley Medical Center and asked to only use a nickname, wrote in an email to the Guardian that nurses are \u201ccovered head to toe in whatever PPE they can find\u201d, but there still isn\u2019t enough. Jane said she and her peers use one N95 mask per 12-hour shift, and they\u2019re putting the masks in paper bags to reuse even after they\u2019re assumed contaminated. Amid the scarcity, employees have started buying their own PPE, she said. Jane described desolate hospital halls, juxtaposed with a \u201cchaotic\u201d ICU, where patient monitoring alarms blare, signaling another person\u2019s decline. She laments the lack of staff and hazard pay, doubled patient loads and risk of infection. But after her shift is done, what stays with her is how many young, relatively healthy people are dying. And dying alone, because their loved ones are not allowed to visit, for fear of spreading this invisible killer. \u201cI feel defeated,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI also feel helpless because we are working so hard, trying every treatment modality that we can, and patients are still dying. \u201cSometimes I cry driving home from work. I can\u2019t help but think about patients and their family members who weren\u2019t able to be with them or speak with them before they died.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
