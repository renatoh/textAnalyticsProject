But she was unable to answer the question of whether the corporation would have broadcast a similar show if it had centred on the Muslim prophet, Muhammad. Jana Bennett said that while \"no one in the BBC was in hiding\", it had been surprised by the scale and ferocity of the campaign which generated 50,000 phone complaints before Saturday's broadcast and a further 1,400 calls after. \"We were certainly struck by the scale of the protest, but obviously they have an absolute right to make their voices heard,\" she told Radio 4's Today programme. \"We were surprised by the scale of the campaign that was mounted [but] this is also an email age and its also easier to organise a network of complaints.\" \"No one is in hiding but there was a lot of pressure in terms of direct action,\" she said. It was a new situation for many people but we lived our lives as normal.\" Such was the size of the campaign that details of threatening calls were passed on to the police, after Christian groups posted the contact details of the BBC2 controller, Roly Keating, and Ms Bennett, on the internet Ms Bennett said the BBC had \"thought very hard\" before deciding to broadcast the controversial opera, because it was a \"really good piece of theatre that had something to say\". \"It was not a surprise that we considered bringing it to television given that it has won practically every award it could as an opera, was acclaimed by critics and, might I add, hadn't given rise during its 550 stage performances to any protest from Christian groups.\" Asked whether there were different judgments to be made about what was appropriate for the stage and what was more suited to television, Ms Bennett said every piece had to be judged on its worth. \"We have to judge is this a piece of artistic merit, which may cause some offence, (in which case) does the merit outweigh and does it have something to say to make it a meaningful and worthwhile experience?\" Ms Bennett denied the play was blasphemous but said she \"couldn't answer\" if the BBC would have run a similar piece of theatre if the subject matter had been Mohammad because the play was \"not one we're considering\". \"I wouldn't accept that you could say this is blasphemous. There's a big debate about that, I'm sure. It's all about judgment. You can't rule out any subject you have to take every piece on its merit.\" But as Maddie Mogford, media law partner with City law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, said: \"Blasphemy laws come into play if irreverent and scurrilous language is used to vilify Christianity and the bible and is likely to cause a breach of the peace. \"No other religion is included, so the current blasphemy laws would not apply to the play Behzti (Dishonour), depicting a rape in a Sikh gurdwara, which was cancelled after protests at Birmingham's Repertory Theatre. \"The relevant issues are whether blasphemy laws would be contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights (it is thought that they may be), whether Article 10 gives the BBC the right to broadcast and whether the blasphemy laws should be extended to other religions, as David Blunkett wanted to do by amending the laws on inciting racial hatred.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
