More than 120 residents of the UK\u2019s largest charitable provider of care homes are thought to have died from the virus in the last three weeks, while another network of care homes is reported to have recorded 88 deaths. Care England, the industry body, estimated that the death toll is likely to be close to 1,000, despite the only available official figure for care home fatalities being dramatically lower. The Office for National Statistics said this week that 20 people died in care homes across the whole of England and Wales in the week to 27 March. The gulf in the figures has prompted warnings that ministers are underestimating the impact of Covid-19 on society\u2019s most frail, and are failing to sufficiently help besieged care homes and workers. Other homes have reported dozens of deaths as the virus sweeps through vulnerable populations looked after by care workers who say they still lack adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing to curb its spread. Care industry leaders and the Alzheimer\u2019s Society say they believe the virus is now active in around half of care settings, which look after about 400,000 people in the UK. This is far higher than the estimate given by Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government\u2019s chief medical officer, who said on Tuesday that just over 9% of care homes had cases of Covid-19. \u201cWe are seeing underreporting of the number of deaths,\u201d said Prof Martin Green, the chief executive of Care UK, which represents the largest care providers. \u201cDeaths might not be in the thousands yet, but it is coming up to that level. We need a proper analysis of death rates occurring across care homes, and the government should be collecting this data.\u201d Around 70% of residents in one Yorkshire care home for people with dementia, operated by MHA, the UK\u2019s largest charitable provider of care homes, are suspected of being infected. Thirteen people have died in another of MHA\u2019s Yorkshire homes and 11 have died in a home in Northamptonshire. The provider also believes half of its care homes have cases of infection. A separate care home in Luton said on Wednesday that 15 people had died during the crisis, including five who tested positive for Covid-19. Three care homes in Scotland announced 30 deaths between them earlier this week and press reports in the last week have catalogued at least 36 other care home deaths. Jason Oke, a senior statistician at the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences in Oxford, said the current figures were \u201cobviously an underestimate of the severity of the pandemic\u201d. \u201cThe worry is that we discover in six months that the numbers are way larger because no one was counting what was happening in care homes,\u201d he said. Amid fears that the virus is spreading rapidly through homes, especially among dementia patients who are hard to isolate, care leaders and unions are demanding immediate action to deliver more testing and PPE. The Alzheimer\u2019s Society said on Thursday it fears hundreds of thousands of people with dementia \u201care being abandoned in care homes\u201d. The trade union Unison also sent a dossier of hundreds of carers\u2019 complaints about a lack of PPE to ministers, including one report of a carer wearing a bag over their face in the absence of a mask. The daily death toll published by the Department of Health and Social Care only relates to reported deaths in NHS England hospitals. This climbed to nearly 8,000 on Wednesday. The ONS started publishing statistics for deaths in care homes in England and Wales this week, but the current figure \u2013 20 deaths in the week to 27 March \u2013 are 12 days behind the daily hospital death rate and rely only on registered death certificates, which take an average of five days to process. That brings the time lag to around 17 days, and social care operators say this is too slow to grasp the scale of infection and fatalities. \u201cBy only counting deaths in hospitals, [ministers] are sweeping the deaths of older people in care homes under the carpet,\u201d said Peter Kyle, the MP for Hove, who is calling for the appointment of a cabinet minister dedicated to fighting Covid-19 in care settings. \u201cIf social care was a priority that matched other sectors, government would be counting and acting,\u201d he said. The ONS said it can only produce statistics from the death certificates registered by the General Register Office and it is \u201cworking with partners to better understand how the registration and coronial process is adapting under current conditions\u201d. Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, who lost his 71-year-old brother Umar to Covid-19 on Wednesday, said the UK was \u201csubstantially under reporting\u201d coronavirus deaths. \u201cIt appears that some people are not taking this pandemic seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they appreciated the hundreds of families and communities who lost loved ones every day then they might. Fifty-two people were killed on 7/7, we know all their names, everything they lost and left behind. We know nothing of more than 20 times that every day who lose their lives to Covid-19.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe are determined to give the social care sector the support it needs to respond to coronavirus and continue to work closely with Public Health England to monitor the impact on cares homes. \u201cThe government has announced \u00a32.9bn to help local authorities respond to pressures in key services, such as adult social care, and enhance the NHS discharge service, allowing patients to return home safely. We have published extensive guidance for care homes on admitting and caring for people during the outbreak, and we are reinstating the professional registration of 8,000 former social workers to fill vital roles in the community. \u201cWe have also delivered 7.8m pieces of PPE to more than 26,000 care settings across the country and are rapidly working to extend testing to social care workers.\u201d Guidance on who can visit people in hospital during the lockdown was revised on Wednesday after analysis revealed that a quarter of hospitals in England were banning those caring for patients with dementia, a learning disability or autism. The new guidance, which was welcomed by campaigners, means close family members and carers of those with a mental health issue now have the right to visit their loved ones in hospital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
