The watercolour flower cotton flat sheet from Zara Home, to be precise. \u201cI have been looking for a hydrangea print for years,\u201d she told reporters. Stumbling across this pattern, she said, felt like the answer to her prayers. A dressmaker fashioned it into a full-length skirt with a blue satin trim. \u201cIt\u2019s Dame Duvet,\u201d shouted the tabloids, predictably. Now, while the shiny ribbon around the hemline puts the garment firmly into the homemade partywear bracket \u2013 it looks exactly like a flower-girl dress I had to wear to a wedding when I was six \u2013 the idea itself isn\u2019t a bad one. I\u2019ve been making dresses from bed linen for years. Vintage linen sheets are particularly good: starched and robust, they hang beautifully. So I figure this one might work too. I can\u2019t find Te Kanawa\u2019s hydrangeas, but I do find another sheet in the range with a fruit and butterfly print. It looks pretty good inside out, too, so I decide to use it both ways. I\u2019m not wild about such big flowers on my clothes, but if I channel the Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo, there must be a way to make something cool with it. I opt for a Molly Goddard-style oversized dress pattern that a friend \u2013 Val Hui of Otho London \u2013 cut for me a while back. I was going to a wedding, and all the dresses I liked cost thousands of pounds. Dresses so simple they were essentially a kid\u2019s drawing of a dress \u2013 sleeveless top, round neck, A-line skirt. You\u2019re having a laugh, I thought, and decided to make my own. That one was navy blue silk. I wonder how bright white cotton is going to look, and decide I\u2019ll leave edges raw, to offset the chintz. One of the good things about big sheets is precisely that \u2013 they are very big pieces of fabric. This one is 240cm x 280cm, which \u2013 for a full-length skirt, an oversized dress or anything involving pleats or gathering \u2013 is useful. You\u2019ve got a lot to work with. This is thin white cotton, so it\u2019s definitely going to be see-through. After I\u2019ve cut out the top, I use two lengths of the full width of the sheet for the gathered skirt, so that I can double up the layers in place of a lining. Riffing on the way Comme des Gar\u00e7ons dresses often use messy, scrunched-up wads of fabric as trim or texture, I add an extra length of pleats around the waistline and hemline and leave the neck and armholes unhemmed. Also, I made this in three and a half hours flat, so there wasn\u2019t time to hem anything. But that is the other good thing about working with bed linen \u2013 it\u2019s very strong, durable fabric and it has already been professionally hemmed. So any way you can incorporate those hems into your garment is a winner. I greet the photographer at the door wearing the dress, only for him to look around for what we\u2019re shooting. \u201cOh,\u201d he says when I tell him this is it. Which I guess is good \u2013 he was briefed about a bedsheet, but all he saw were my clothes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
