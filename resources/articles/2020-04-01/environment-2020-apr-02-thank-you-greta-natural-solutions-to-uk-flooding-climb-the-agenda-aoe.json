Swollen rivers have been sluggishly sitting in the valley for months. Inhabitants\u2019 attempts to protect their homes from flooding are part of a losing battle played out across the country. The UK\u2019s flooding this year is a story of desperation \u2013 but also hope, says John Hughes, development manager at Shropshire Wildlife Trust, who works in the valley. Following widespread acceptance of the climate and ecological emergency, Hughes believes people are increasingly looking to nature for solutions. George Eustice, the environment secretary, has announced that \u00a34bn will be spent on flood defences in the next five years and said a \u201cbig part of our focus is going to be nature-based solutions upstream\u201d. Hughes says: \u201cThe media normally have a distinct agenda when it comes to floods which is: \u2018how miserable have you been?\u2019 This time around the interviews I heard were talking about natural solutions and I\u2019d never heard that before. \u201cI say thanks very much Extinction Rebellion and Greta [Thunberg] \u2013 you\u2019ve done a great job. It\u2019s the job we\u2019ve been trying to do for 50 years. We need to take a holistic view \u2013 land can do many, many things.\u201d Soils In the past, flood plains acted like sponges that soaked up water and stopped it flowing headlong into settlements downstream. Wetter habitats provided useful materials such as willow and reeds for baskets and thatched roofs. However, natural wet woodland, neutral grassland, fens and marshes were ironed out of the postwar landscape and now cover just 11% of English and Welsh flood plains. Intensive agriculture covers 70%. Crops such as maize, potatoes, asparagus and onions are harvested as late as October because of the milder UK climate. This means fields are often left bare over winter months after heavy machinery has compacted the soil. This leaves the land unable to soak up so much water. \u201cWhen you drive heavy vehicles on soggy soil you make a mess,\u201d says John Quinton, professor of soil science at Lancaster University. \u201cYou\u2019ve then destroyed the soil structure, and because of that water can\u2019t get into the soil very quickly. The water runs over the surface of the soil and picks up the soil and deposits it in rivers or elsewhere. If soils are in good condition, the water will go into the soil and you will have a lot of storage.\u201d Scientists say creating grassland, giving land rest periods and avoiding the use of heavy machinery in flood-prone areas will reduce nutrient and sediment loss from fields. \u201cSome groups of farmers are definitely moving in the right direction. When I started my career in the late 80s we weren\u2019t talking about soil erosion or nutrient losses. Things are changing,\u201d says Quinton. Experts are only beginning to understand the complexity of soil ecosystems. In the flood-hit village of Eaton Bishop in Herefordshire, farm conservation adviser Caroline Hanks compares two spadefuls of soil from the same field near her house \u2013 one from the middle of the field where intensively farmed maize was harvested in October, and the other from under tussocky grass by the hedge. The first sample is root-free and heavily compacted, meaning water cannot percolate more than eight inches below the surface. The second spadeful is crumbly, full of roots and moist throughout. The two samples look \u2013 and smell \u2013 different. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to give people a visual way to assess their soil. It\u2019s such a simple technique \u2013 you can tell so much from a spadeful of soil,\u201d says Hanks, who specialises in advising farmers on creating flower-rich grassland. \u201cTwenty years ago people expected us to focus on birds and hedgerows and field edges but these days getting a spade out and looking at soil is a core part of the visit.\u201d According to Quinton\u2019s Defra-funded research there is between three and 10 times more water run-off from compacted soils than healthy soils. \u201cThat rotten egg smell you get from compacted soils is certainly something that says to me that\u2019s an unhealthy soil,\u201d he says. \u201cIt shows that it\u2019s compacted and its normal biology isn\u2019t functioning very well. In the soil that\u2019s aerated you\u2019ve got fungi and bacteria which are active and sometimes after rain, you get that sweet smell of damp soil, and it\u2019s actually a compound called geosmin.\u201d Creating rough landscapes Many natural flood-management techniques involve reinstating features that were once common to fields such as ponds, hedges and leaky dams (either created by fallen trees or beavers). Creating buffer strips, wooded areas, drainage ditches and re-meandering rivers are all part of the toolkit. The overall effect is to give the landscape more structure and roughness to counterbalance the way industrialised farming has smoothed it out. The problem is that reducing food production is currently counterintuitive to most farmers\u2019 business plan, says Dr Marc Stutter, a soil and water scientist at the James Hutton Institute. \u201cThe biggest thing we\u2019re fighting against is that the farmers and their fathers and grandfathers have been very proud of the way they\u2019ve brought the land into condition for crops and quite rightfully so. Their parents have spent a lot of effort draining the land and now there\u2019s someone telling them they want pockets of it to be wet up again. \u201cIf we could reverse it and say they\u2019re not just farmers of a crop but stewards of the land then we might be able to think of water quality and flood resistance as part of their overall job.\u201d Natural flood management has other benefits \u2013 planting trees and hedges helps to create vital habitats for nature and locks away carbon. Creating buffer strips along streams and rivers helps filter out pollutants and improves water quality. However, nature-based solutions are no silver bullet, according to analysis by the University of Oxford which found they would be overwhelmed by the sort of floods seen in the UK this winter. Making the land more absorbent should be used alongside traditional \u201chard engineering\u201d techniques such as flood walls, says Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading. \u201cPutting beavers in the River Thames is not going to keep people dry and a different solution is required. However, for some of the smaller communities you could implement woody debris dams and make sure the soil upstream is able to absorb the water. Not one size fits all. It must be an open discussion between farmers and Defra and the Environment Agency and scientists. It\u2019s not an easy problem but I think we should be confident that we can solve it,\u201d she says. Case studies In 2015 Glenridding, a village at the bottom of Helvellyn in the Lake District, was one of many communities trashed by Storm Desmond. Danny Teasdale, a mechanic from the village, decided to do something. \u201cFlooding isn\u2019t going to go away, we\u2019ve got to start looking at things. There are extreme conservationists on one side and extreme farmers on the other and they keep clashing heads and nothing happens. I sit in the middle \u2026 I know the local farmers and they trust me,\u201d he says. In the valley above the village, Teasdale created a wiggly upstream release channel that runs parallel to the river and fills up only when the river is full. He worked with the local farmer and the Environment Agency. The \u00a36,000 project was funded by a local flood action group. Teasdale says: \u201cWe\u2019ve just had really, really heavy rain with Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis \u2013 I think some of the heaviest since Storm Desmond \u2013 and it didn\u2019t flood this time. So it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s been helping. It goes hand in hand with hard engineering in the village but if you can slow things down upstream you don\u2019t need to build your walls so high.\u201d Teasdale\u2019s work was so successful he created a community interest group called Ullswater Catchment Management CIC in November 2018. He has since worked in a number of different catchments around Ullswater with the Woodland Trust, Natural England and the Environment Agency, including planting 2,000 trees in Grisedale valley at a cost of \u00a38,000 and a project to re-wiggle the river in Matterdale that cost \u00a314,000. \u201cIt\u2019s peanuts compared to the money that goes into hard engineering,\u201d explains Teasdale, who says \u00a32m has already been spent on hard flood defences in Glenridding. Elsewhere in the Lake District, the RSPB led a similar river re-wiggling scheme in Swindale valley. The work cost \u00a3200,000 and involved letting the river meander back into its old course after being straightened by hill farmers looking to dry out land hundreds of years ago. The valley is a kilometre long and the river is now 180 metres longer. \u201cIt\u2019s all about holding that water in the higher catchments for longer,\u201d says Lee Schofield, a site manager at RSPB Haweswater. \u201cHaving a wiggly river means they move more slowly. We\u2019re delaying flood peak \u2013 it\u2019s a low-tech solution that delivers many other benefits and makes the landscape much more resilient.\u201d Paul Quinn, a senior lecturer in catchment hydrology at Newcastle University, believes more drastic landscape measures, called catchment systems engineering (CSE), are needed to compensate for the fact that flood plains are already full of houses and roads. More than 40% of rivers have been deepened or modified so that they are no longer connected to their flood plains. \u201cIn a beautiful world that doesn\u2019t exist, we could get our soil back into good condition and that would actually stop a lot of floods. But when the big floods come along \u2013 the kind that climate change is going to produce \u2013 soil management is not going to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cCSE is halfway between nature-based solutions and something that\u2019s a bit like traditional flood management which is usually big dams, big ponds and big walls. We need to start spreading them out over the whole catchment system. It seems to me such a simple idea. It\u2019s not rocket science, it\u2019s about storing water \u2013 and large amounts of it \u2013 at every opportunity you can.\u201d Quinn\u2019s approach includes natural solutions as well as features such as the creation of large retention ponds and cascading channels. His team built 35 ponds and dams, and created 10 zones of oak, beech and willow plantations in the catchment attached to the village of Belford in Northumberland which has been badly affected by flooding. The scheme cost \u00a3200,000 and in the seven years since the work was completed the village has not flooded. \u201cEvery single catchment in the country will have to be done,\u201d he says. What next? In terms of soils, Quinton believes people\u2019s attitudes are already changing: \u201cI sense a shift in the farming community with a much greater emphasis on soils and how to sustain them. I have no evidence for this, except talking to farmers and watching Twitter. I get the feeling that there is increasing recognition that protecting soils is vital for the sustainability of the farm business.\u201d Farmers think of food production as their primary motivation because that is what they have been subsidised to do. Rather than trying to farm flood-prone areas of land that don\u2019t yield much, farmers may be subsidised to manage them for nature. Many feel the government is making the right noises with policies laid out in the new Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) \u2013 which will be fully implemented by 2028. A Defra spokesperson told the Guardian that natural flood management would be an important part of protecting the nation from flooding. \u201cELMS will reward farmers for the public goods that they provide, including protecting communities from environmental hazards such as flooding. Natural England and the Environment Agency do vital work and we continue to work closely with both agencies to ensure they have the right resources to continue to do so.\u201d Soil management has featured prominently in ELMS \u2013 with funding set to be available for measures such as no-till agriculture and maintaining water in peat soils \u2013 but conservationists are worried that the devil is in the detail. Teasdale says: \u201cI\u2019ve seen what the government has done to Environment Agency and Natural England and what they\u2019ve done to their budget, and it\u2019s criminal. They\u2019ve slashed it. ELMS could potentially be good but it needs to be funded properly and that\u2019s what I\u2019m not sure about. I\u2019d love to be wrong.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
