The Addicks agreed a one-year loan deal for the 22-year-old with his Costa Rican club Deportivo Saprissa earlier this month, but have yet to receive international clearance and a work permit. Their appeal is due to be heard by the Home Office today. Bolanas played for his country twice in the World Cup finals, as a substitute against Germany and then starting the game against Poland. He also had an unsuccessful trial at Liverpool after impressing against the Reds in the 2005 Club World Championship. Dowie hopes that the Costa Rican will be among \"one or two\" players he plans to bring in before the transfer window closes. \"We have an appeal on Tuesday and are hopeful that will be positive,\" the Charlton manager said. \"He has played internationals recently, but they look over a longer period of time. Christian has come in and really been a star. He played very well at the World Cup, but for some reason we have to go to an appeal. We will have to see, but I hope he will be available for Chelsea.\" Charlton recorded their first win under Dowie with a 2-0 victory over Bolton on Saturday at The Valley, with several of the starting line-up having signed since Dowie's summer arrival. The goalkeeper Scott Carson, who is on a season's loan from Liverpool, produced a fine save from El Hadji Diouf's second-half penalty when the game was goalless, while the midfielder Andy Reid - signed from Tottenham - was involved in the move which lead to the penalty converted by Darren Bent and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink then set up a second for the England striker in the closing minutes. \"Jimmy has been fantastic,\" Dowie said of the Dutch striker. \"It wouldn't surprise me if he goes into coaching because he understands the game. He has been there and done it, and has been the top scorer wherever he has been. He has been huge around the place.\" Dowie revealed that within three days of his arrival at The Valley Hasselbaink had joined his team's \"leadership group\". \"We appoint leaders in the team who come and talk to me about certain issues,\" he explained. \"Things like diet and food and recovery, training times, if they need more training or relaxing. It gives me great feedback, and if you don't get feedback in the modern game, you are shot.\" Stuart Pearce will hunt for bargains until the transfer window finally slams shut on Thursday, with a left winger his priority. The Manchester City manager has already signed seven players this summer, although a combination of injury and red tape mean Didier Hamann, Andreas Isaksson and Hatem Trabelsi have yet to feature for the club. However, despite Saturday's stirring win over Arsenal, and confirmation that Sylvain Distin will remain at Eastlands for the final year of his contract, Pearce knows there are still issues to be addressed, notably on the left-hand side of midfield. Lens' Olivier Thomert, who can operate on the left or up front, continues to be strongly linked with City, although any deal is initially likely to be done on a loan basis. \"The chairman has finished his spending,\" said Pearce. \"But I haven't. We are still unbalanced in the sense we do not have a left-sided midfield player. It is something we have been trying to address and will continue to do so until Thursday but it has been difficult because of the budget situation and the availability of players.\" Pearce asked Georgios Samaras to fill the role during City's first two games, then turned to Darius Vassell for the match against Arsenal. He has nothing but praise for the duo but admits the situation is hardly ideal. \"The beauty of having a squad of players who want to work for you is the fact that neither Georgios nor Darius questioned what I wanted to do,\" he said. \"They could have argued against it, but they didn't and, under the circumstances, that is very helpful. Darius gave his lot for the team on Saturday and against Arsenal, you need unselfishness like that. But the left-sided situation is one we will have to address.\" PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
