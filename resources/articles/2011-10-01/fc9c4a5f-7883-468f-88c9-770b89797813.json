What was the rightwinger up to? Who was paying so he could be shadowed by his mysterious friend Adam Werritty? And as the inquiry continues, someone might wonder how he had the brass neck to whinge on in parliament about the iniquities of the \"vindictive\" media, knowing full well that he himself had been involved in spreading stories about another figure in the public eye; stories which, unlike those written about him, weren't even true. For many in Reading still recall how in 2005, the same Dr Fox, then Tory deputy chair, featured in a libel case that arose after he and two parliamentary hopefuls accused the then Labour MP, Martin Salter, of improper conduct and corruption. Dr Fox was the first MP to be sued by a fellow MP in more than 100 years. All the accusations were proved false, and having made it to the high court the trio were forced to back down, with \u00a360,000 spent on lawyers and \u00a315,000 gifted to Salter in damages. Was that vindictive? You decide. But it wasn't nice, was it? \u2022 Chatham House rules. No names. That's the deal. So the diary can only tell you we were present at a fascinating briefing by a very senior civil servant to a packed house at an Oxford college late last week. Humphrey \u2013 a code name, you understand \u2013 forecast a rough economic ride for the coalition and more \"tough love\" on the civil and public services after he (or she) moves to greener pastures, from whence have already come \"a refreshing number of offers\". This \"tough love\" involved all departments apart from the Treasury \u2013 the one doing the cutting \u2013 which loses 26% of its staff by churn every year; though alas \"not necessarily the right 26%\". Tough love also on the menu for the press, about which Humphrey was ambivalent, especially as the Daily Mail doorstepped his neighbours, looking to dig up dirt on him. We won't miss you, Cherie Blair famously spat at the media as she and Tony left No 10 for the last time. And a bruised Humphrey felt much the same. \u2022 We all reach the end at some stage. But for television presenters the end is usually abrupt, always public and, more often than not, brutal. After a long run Peter Sissons, along with Michael Buerk, was taken to lunch by his BBC boss and told the time was up for them fronting the Ten O'Clock News bulletin. The controller of BBC One had called for new faces. All change. And having seen it all before, Sissons told a student audience last week that a similar lunch and fate may well be awaiting his successor at Channel 4 News, the peerless Jon Snow. \"It looks that way,\" he said, with Snow now having to share presenting duties with newcomer Cathy Newman. As for Paxo, opined Sissons: \"He's looking bored and perhaps just wants to do University Challenge now.\" At least the undergrads try to answer his questions. \u2022 Top news, meanwhile, from the Daily Mail's online rant-fest RightMinds, where the boss Simon Heffer has been able to resurrect the soapbox of that astute commentator on rightwing Toryism and so much else, Donal Blaney. The co-founder of the seemingly very Tory and yet avowedly \"non-partisan\" Young Britons' Foundation, Blaney's voice has been silent for too long. His last blog, Blaney's Blarney, was racy reading for disciples of the Tory \"madrasa\" and certainly distinctive. In it, he defended waterboarding and called for environmental protesters who trespass to be \"shot down\" by the police. And \"would it not now be better to say that the NHS \u2013 in its current incarnation \u2013 is finished\", asked Blaney. Quite a coup to get him. A perfect gender balance to our spiky RightMinds heroine Melanie Phillips. \u2022 Finally, amid the rejoicing over the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, another view. \"Gaddafi died a hero, defending Libya against the Nato oil thieves,\" trumpets the Workers Revolutionary party. \"His heroism will inspire millions,\" the organ Newsline says. By contrast, \"the names of Cameron, Hague, Sarkozy and Obama will stink throughout history\". Gaddafi is dead. Dave Spart lives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
