To dye for Before you throw out that old three-piece suite, consider having it re-dyed instead. Blue Mill is an expert dyer and finisher based in Leicester. Its normal business is handling designer knitwear, but it can also revamp curtains, sofa covers or rugs at a fraction of the cost of replacement. All you have to do is send the item to its workshop, together with your desired colour (which can be sent as a piece of paint chart, thread or even an old shirt) and Blue Mill will do the rest. A three-seater sofa re-dyed costs just \u00a3148 and there is also a stain-resistant treatment.
