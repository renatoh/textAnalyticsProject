The app promises to show women \u201clike-minded mamas near you\u201d and has grown significantly in the two years since it was set up, with more than a million global users. Download it and you\u2019ll be asked to describe the type of \u201cmama\u201d you are from a list of options including \u201chot mess\u201d, \u201cstrictly organic\u201d, or \u201calways on vacay\u201d, then you\u2019ll be shown others nearby. The unusual name, Peanut, is based on the nickname Kennedy gave her first baby when she was pregnant. Kennedy began her professional career as a lawyer, sidestepping into tech after helping a tech firm with legal advice. She helped found Bumble, working to develop tech for the dating industry for six years, and used this experience to shape Peanut. \u201cI wanted it to be fun, to break the ice and to gamify the experience,\u201d she says, \u201cinstead of making it intimidating or making it feel like there is any element of rejection.\u201d There are a number of reasons why being a new parent can be lonely, Kennedy says. From taking time off work and away from social activities, to spending long periods of time alone with a baby. Plus, it\u2019s not always easy to go out in public and there\u2019s often nowhere to go. \u201cIt\u2019s like mobilising an army to get out of the house when you have a newborn,\u201d she says. You might also be free at antisocial times. \u201cFor example, you\u2019ve been up all night, it\u2019s finally 7am and the baby\u2019s gone to sleep, but no one else is around.\u201d Despite this, it can be hard for new mothers to speak up. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel OK to say I\u2019m feeling lonely, or worse, bored,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cThere\u2019s a social stigma attached to feeling isolated and there\u2019s an even bigger stigma attached to the fact that you\u2019re not grateful to be a mum.\u201d Kennedy wanted other mothers to feel less alone, so, when Finlay was just two years old, she set about creating Peanut. First, she created a business plan. \u201cI worked out what I wanted to achieve, by when and what it would take to get there, in terms of building a team and financing the product,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I went to pitch.\u201d Venture capitalists (VCs) investing in the tech sector are overwhelmingly male, and female founders pitching products for women can encounter difficulties in persuading VCs of their potential. Kennedy recalls how one VC commented that their wife didn\u2019t need another social network: \u201cThat made me want to scream.\u201d But overall the response was positive. \u201cI had my first term sheet within 24 hours from a male VC and we now have a team of investors who believe fully in the need for a tech platform for women.\u201d Peanut is now a team of 16 and free to use and join, so pre-revenue. Setting up and running an international tech company with two small children \u2013 Kennedy\u2019s second child Nuala, is now four months old \u2013 has not been easy. \u201cI have help and my husband and I are a real team,\u201d she says. \u201cI work silly hours to make sure I\u2019m home for bathtime, then start working again in the evening. I also haven\u2019t seen my friends in a while. But I love what I do and believe in what Peanut is building \u2013 there\u2019s no greater reward than that.\u201d The app matches women based on their interests and the age of their children. \u201cWe build a profile of you,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just; I\u2019m a mum and you\u2019re a mum. We use commonalities to match you with women who are similar to you.\u201d There are also community threads where mothers can have conversations and ask for advice. Mothers who have written to Peanut say the app has connected them with women they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have met, given them a network and helped when they\u2019ve felt overwhelmed. But there has been hate mail, too. \u201cWe\u2019ve had negative reactions from men who say we don\u2019t support fathers,\u201d Kennedy says. For now, Peanut is focused solely on women. \u201cI say, go build your own app if you feel there\u2019s a need, but there should be a safe space for women to talk frankly. For example, to say they\u2019re worried about having sex after having a baby because their body has changed.\u201d When people hear Peanut is an app for lonely mothers, some still give her \u201cthe soft smile\u201d, Kennedy says. \u201cThere\u2019s always an element of, \u2018Oh that\u2019s nice and it\u2019s for mums,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not cute. It\u2019s much more raw and real than that and it\u2019s bloody hard work. This isn\u2019t a cutesy product. There\u2019s nothing twee about it.\u201d Since creating Peanut, Kennedy says she\u2019s learned that parental loneliness is \u201cmore prevalent than any of us could ever know\u201d. In a modern, digital world, it\u2019s easy to foster superficial connections, she says, but perhaps more difficult to create connections that have substance. \u201cThe world is bigger, we can access anyone anywhere now. I can connect by commenting on someone\u2019s post on Instagram,\u201d she says. \u201cBut making intimate connections [can be more difficult], so these products are important.\u201d Kennedy has largely overcome her own loneliness. \u201cThere\u2019s always elements of it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut as a mother I\u2019m much more able to reach out and ask for help when I need it, and, of course, Peanut has helped with that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false}}}
