Against Arsenal on Sunday opinions from inside Goodison Park may not be easily ignored. Just when Everton thought their problems were confined to Koeman\u2019s overpriced, underperforming team a knuckle-dragger emerges from the Gwladys Street stand, child in arm, to aim a blow at Lyon\u2019s goalkeeper, Anthony Lopes. His actions have prompted a police investigation, a ban from the club and disciplinary action by Uefa, yet could not distract totally from another severe setback for the Everton manager on Thursday. Lyon was a must-win for Everton\u2019s Europa League prospects, Koeman said beforehand. A 2-1 defeat ensured they go into the Arsenal game having won twice in 12 matches, lost six of the past 10 and with their \u00a36m-a-year coach under intense pressure \u2013 if not from the board, then from an increasingly disillusioned fanbase. \u201cI am still the man and we will fight for everything to turn it around,\u201d said Koeman, who has followed recent Twitter advice and shaved before Arsenal\u2019s visit. \u201cNow I am 10 years younger after a shave,\u201d he quipped. \u201cBut no, seriously, it is normal it has an impact if the team is not doing well; then it always comes in the direction of the manager. If you don\u2019t like it, then take another job.\u201d Koeman is clinging to the positive that Everton displayed fighting spirit against Lyon \u2013 not a reference to the pitchside m\u00eal\u00e9e sparked by Ashley Williams. As for quality, however, something that might be expected following a summer outlay of almost \u00a3140m, that was mentioned only in terms of its absence. \u201cI can\u2019t complain about the attitude or workrate of the players,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cBut I can about several situations in the game, about cleverness, about quality and about decision-making. But not about how they fight, how they try and what they give on the pitch.\u201d He says that, with the exception of the \u00a330m goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and Wayne Rooney, none of the club\u2019s summer signings has fulfilled expectations \u201cat the moment but the future will tell everyone that the signings we did were really good signings\u201d. He elaborated: \u201cYou need time to adapt. That\u2019s the situation for Davy Klaassen and the situation for Sandro Ram\u00edrez. Yes, Pickford is showing why we signed him as maybe a future No1 for England. Michael Keane is performing well sometimes, like the first half against Lyon, but the second half was not good. He made mistakes in the buildup. [Gylfi] Sigurdsson showed in 20-25 minutes yesterday why we signed him with an assist and was close to making a second goal. He will show that quality. Wayne Rooney is not a player for me who brings any doubts. He is a quality player but of course the situation is difficult. For Davy Klaassen it is a lack of confidence. You can see that in his decision-making on the pitch and about his aggression. I expect him to be more aggressive but with many doubts in his head it is difficult to play football.\u201d A home win over Arsenal was a turning point for Everton last season although last season they had Romelu Lukaku. Despite being aware of Lukaku\u2019s intention to leave in the spring and heavy investment in the summer, Everton are now reliant on the inexperienced Dominic Calvert-Lewin, the once-ostracised Oumar Niasse and the \u00a35.2m summer recruit Ram\u00edrez to lead the line. The boardroom\u2019s support for Koeman perhaps stems from a recognition the manager is not solely to blame for the gaping hole in his team. \u201cWe know that we don\u2019t have that striker in what we expected and that makes it more difficult,\u201d said Koeman, who will have regrets when he sees Olivier Giroud, a striker he wanted, in the Arsenal ranks on Sunday. \u201cIt is not straight and honest to expect Dominic to be that already. He will grow and is improving and nobody else of that age is playing as often in the Premier League and in a difficult position. We had someone who scored 25 goals last season and that is a big miss. It is not easy to find something that is better than it was. And that\u2019s normal. \u201cOn the football side Steve Walsh [the director of football] and I were working on getting a good one in. We didn\u2019t get anyone in who was better than the players we had and then there was the cost of several players who were not the first options. Finally we decided not to sign. We knew we had some new players in. We needed time. What is the best formation? What is the best striker with Wayne, Sigurdsson, Klaassen? We struggled at the beginning to get the right formation and that makes it even difficult. Then not good results and that brings us back to the lack of confidence.\u201d And avoiding Twitter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
