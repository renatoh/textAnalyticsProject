It goes into each nation's thoughts on whether the BBC, the Queen and the pound should be kept by everyone. The results of the survey by NatCen suggests that the country is broadly in agreement on how things should play out, whichever side Scotland takes in September. In the light of Ukip's success in the European referendum it also reveals that people are increasingly strict about who should be defined as British. 95% of people think that to be \"truly British\", you have to speak English which is up from 85% in 1995. 77% think a person has to have lived in Britain for all their life, which is also up from 1995 by six percentage points. National identity - what makes us British? Speaking English was considered the most important factor in whether somebody could be judged as \"truly British\". 85% thought that having citizenship was necessary, while the same proportion demanded respect for laws and institutions. Out of the nine statements listed in the graph above, the least important factor seems to be Christianity, which only 25% say is important - a drop of seven percentage points on 2003. As you would expect, there is a strong link between people's views on migrants and on what they view as being important in being \"truly British\". The report says: Those who emphasise a mix of civic factors (like speaking English) and ethnic ones (like being born in Britain) are far more likely to oppose immigration than those who think only civic factors matter. Immigration - the issue that divides the country London's views on immigration put it out of step with the rest of the country. 54% in the capital think immigration has been a good thing for the UK's economy, compared with just 25% elsewhere in Britain. It's not just a regional split on migration though but a social one too. 60% of those educated to degree level saw the benefits of immigration to the economy, while just 17% of those wit no qualifications held the same view. The table above shows how views on the economic impact of immigration varies by education status and social class. Of the latter, professionals and managers are the most likely to view immigration as having a positive impact. The report lays bare the difficulties politicians have in resolving this social split: In the case of immigration, it is evident that politicians and policy makers tend to be drawn heavily from the more socially advantaged and highly educated end of the spectrum, creating a potential for disconnect and distrust between a more liberal political class which accepts immigration and an electorate among whom many find it intensely threatening. How England and Wales would feel about Scottish independence We've already reported on how the survey reveals the majority of people in England want Scotland to stay in the UK. However, the country (as it stands) is a lot less divided than it may seem on a number of issues that will crop up if the pro-independence campaign wins in September. 62% of people in Scotland think that the same King or Queen should be kept if independence is chosen. 65% of those in England and Wales agree. When it comes to the BBC, 86% of those in Scotland want to keep it and 82% in England and Wales think they should be able to too. The biggest split is on the sterling issue. 69% in England and Wales think that the pound should still be used in Scotland after independence. 79% of those north of the border are keen to keep it. How England and Wales (and Scotland) would feel if there is no independence What happens if Scotland votes no and wins greater powers over taxation? The below chart shows that 48% of people in Scotland think that money raised through income tax there should be used north of the border. This compares with 25% of people who feel the same way in England and Wales. There is much more of a split when it comes to the use of money raised through taxation of North Sea oil. Just 12% of people in England and Wales think that should only be spent in Scotland, compared with 44% of those who actually live there. Despite the above chart, three out of five of those north of the border think that pension payments for those in the country should be drawn from across the UK. The report concludes that regardless of whether yes or no wins, \"there is broad agreement between Scotland and those in the rest of the UK about how their future relationship should be handled.\" Economic outlook key to Scottish independence Although there was a lot of debate and questioning of the economic forecasts recently released by both sides of the independence debate, the survey shows that both were going at the right subject. 30% of people living there think that Scotland's economy would be better under independence, while 34% think it would be worse. Of those that think it would be a lot better after independence, 86% will vote yes compared with the 2% who will vote yes in spite of thinking it will get a lot worse. Ramming this point home, when people were asked if they would vote for independence if Scotland voted yes, 52% said they would be in favour and 29% against. While if the country was \u00a3500 worse off, then just 16% would go for it compared with 70% who wouldn't. Difference between the extent to which people believe the UK is democratic and how important they feel democracy is 84% of people answer six or above when asked to rate how important living in a democratically governed country is on a scale of one to ten, while 57% rate it as nine or higher. The average score for all is 8.4 out of ten. Nevertheless, 26% of people think Britain scores five or below on how democratic it is and the average rating is 6.6 out of ten. Going into this minority in more detail, 24% of people are dissatisfied with the way that the UK government engages with the public while 18% think that the courts do not treat people equally.
