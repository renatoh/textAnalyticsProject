Andy D'Urso's dismissal of Jermaine Johnson baffled both managers but replays suggested the Wednesday player used his elbow during a tussle for the ball with Jonathan Greening. Wednesday had been the better team up to that point and they continued to hold the Baggies at bay until, with seconds remaining, Phillips rose to James Morrison's cross to score his 17th league goal of the season. \"That's an important result against a team which worked hard and possibly deserved something from the game but football is cruel sometimes,\" said Albion's manager, Tony Mowbray. A couple of weeks ago he pointed out that Albion were being described as a club in crisis but victories over Plymouth and now the Owls have thrust them right back into the fight for automatic promotion. They will certainly go into Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final against Bristol Rovers in good heart while Wednesday, who remain in the relegation zone, must regroup quickly. \"It would be easy to blame the referee but we must not use that as an excuse,\" said Wednesday's manager, Brian Laws. \"We should still have been able to run the clock down but we let them get a cross in and then got caught ball-watching.\" If the result was cruel, Mowbray was right to suggest Albion had made the better chances. Robert Koren brought a fine save from the goalkeeper Lee Grant and Paul Robinson pulled a shot wide from six yards in the first half. To set against that Enoch Showumni had Wednesday's best opportunity shortly before the hour but Albion's Dean Kiely came out and blocked bravely. When Ishmael Miller's late effort was saved by Grant it seemed Wednesday would hang on but Phillips, as so often, was on hand to make the difference."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
