Listening yesterday, as his voice was subsumed by acres of easy-listening music \u2013 this is a station that plays more than one George Michael track in a show \u2013 I couldn't help concluding that this sector so often squanders the talent it has. There are radio broadcasters you want to hear less of, but Anstis isn't one of them. I recall a documentary he did for Radio 4 about a Salvador Dal\u00ed acolyte, and it was very nearly brilliant. He also has a bouncy way with people on-air, which is wasted on this show. Anstis follows the breakfast slot and it's as if that never happened: we're back in the early 70s, with a guess-the-year hour (yes, really) followed by lots of tunes and not much talking. Radio, if it is to flourish and survive, has to offer personality and intimacy. Otherwise, we could just all turn to mp3s. Anstis is stuck with syrupy songs and brief links, and I couldn't fathom why. These days, commercial radio should be trying everything, anything, to keep its listeners, and that includes new formats, features and ideas. Hearing Anstis seemingly thrilled by the new Whitney Houston album (\"really good news\"), I felt very depressed about radio's future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
