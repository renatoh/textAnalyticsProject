We have spent a week in Manly at the northern entrance to Sydney harbour. The temperature has been cooler than in Brisbane, but the mercury is rising in the temper gauge. Manly is a surfing suburb. I had a go last week, thinking it might exhaust me and help me have a good night's kip. A turtle missing all its fins would have had a better chance of standing up on that damned board than yours truly. And, worn out though I indeed was, I still woke up at 4.30am. There was a television programme on about various manifestations of plague in Australia, which I reckon was another omen. First there were the rabbits over-running farms in Victoria, then water hyacinth choking the wetlands of New South Wales and finally the fire ants chomping their way through Northern Territories. As far as I can tell, the malaise started straight after the Lions' impressive win over Queensland. As far as we were aware, any nonsense - 'going the biff', they call it here - could be laid at the door of the Reds. This was probably a bit jingoistic of us, but nothing compared with the observations on the violence by Eddie Jones. Eddie is coach of the ACT Brumbies, who have just won the Super 12. And he's next in line, so everyone thinks, for the Wallabies job, once Rod MacQueen steps down in October. And he was also coach of Australia A, whom the Lions were going to face in Gosford, an hour up the road from Manly, last Tuesday. And, according to Eddie, any biff was the Lions' fault. The referees needed to be looking out for any nonsense off the ball. This touched a local nerve. The Lions tour of 1989 resurfaced immediately. They really had gone the biff then and the stories were retold of how, when the Wallaby icon and targeted scrum-half, Nick Farr Jones, eventually hauled his battered features out of the changing room, his wife looked at him and burst into tears. Donal Lenihan, a player himself on that tour and now manager of this, begged us to stop making comparisons with 1989. Rugby had changed. The Lions were here to play rugby. Any chance of complying with that? None at all. They love the biff out here. It's all to do with getting rugby in the papers. Rugby union, that is. League still dominates in Sydney and pages are filled with the ins and outs of the Parramatta Eels and Wests. There is a feeling, however, that union will one day take over. The international dimension of union appeals to multinationals run by Rupert Murdoch and his ilk. League has never really recovered from the internecine war he helped spark between Super League and the Australian Rugby League. The State of Origin series between Queensland and New South Wales - their decider will be played on 1 July - is still massive, but club attendances are down. Strange amalgamations have diluted some long-held passions for the 13-a-side code. One of the most famous names of all, South Sydney, has disappeared altogether. It's like Wigan vanishing. Manly, another famous name, combined with North Sydney and Central Coast to form the Northern Eagles, who now play half their home games at Brookvale and half at North Power Stadium, Gosford. Where the Lions would play Australia A. Union may hold a few aces, like the Wallabies being able to call themselves world champions and ACT the champions of the Super 12, but the day they dominate the rugby codes is still a very long way off. The clubhouse of the Northern Eagles, across the road behind the main stand of the brand new North Power stadium - capacity 25,000 - is on a scale unimaginable in the world of club rugby union. The ball room is vast, the media facilities are enormous, the bars are endless and the poker machines - the pokies - are innumerable. That night, of course, the Lions lost. The omens had not been false after all. Eddie Jones said how pleased he was with the cleanliness of the game. Perhaps they might, through 'due process', have another peek at the Ben Cohen tackle on Richard Graham, which left the full-back with a fractured cheekbone. But in general, no, he was happy. This was merely the cue for Bob Dwyer to pick up the baton. The former coach of Australia, Bristol and Leicester is now coach of the Waratahs, the Lions' next opponents. He cranked it up between Tuesday and yesterday by accusing the tourists of cheating. Off-side, killing the ball; the usual. Andy Robinson, the Lions assistant coach, fired back a salvo about the Australians no longer wanting to scrummage. It was all grist to the mill of keeping rugby union in the Sydney Morning Herald. As for our press, we were heading for the opera. Well, you have to, don't you? A spot of Puccini for the lads. Il Trittico. Three one-act plays, don't you know. The first was about a bloke, Michele, sitting on a barge. His pipe had gone out. He loved his wife but she didn't love him; she fancied Luigi who was unloading sacks at the aft end. Michele kills Luigi and puts him under his cloak. That's going the biff in song. The second was Suor Angelica . It was about a nun who was good with herbs. She'd had an illegitimate son several years before. Her aunt came to see her. A princess. A right bitch. Angelica has to sign some papers and Bad Aunt tells her that her son is dead. Angelica takes her own life by making and drinking a herbal poison. Actually, I'm copying the last bit from the programme. As Angelica sang and the sur-titres, as we say in opera, revealed 'Don't dawdle... here have some daphne...' my lids came down. Sleep at last."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
