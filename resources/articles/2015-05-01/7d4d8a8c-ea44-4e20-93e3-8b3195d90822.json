The mumbled splurges of Kozelek\u2019s non-rhyming narrative come so thick and fast that it\u2019s hard to keep up. But you can catch snatches: real-life incidents are recalled (in Little Rascals, looking after an ageing cat; in Garden of Lavender, a 1998 Gomez gig; in Ali/Spinks 2, the death of a family friend) that reveal his hang-ups and tastes. The songs of Sun Kil Moon \u2013 pretty much an alias for Kozelek, though he is accompanied here by former Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley \u2013 veer off on tangents. On the stark epic The Possum, just when you think Kozelek\u2019s hit upon a hook, he stops and does something else entirely. There are spoken segments, garage-rock and pretty acoustic passages, too, but his default setting is intimate and minimal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
