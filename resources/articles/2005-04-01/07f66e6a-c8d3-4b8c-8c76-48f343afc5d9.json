Godfrey Kessie snatched a watch, worth about \u00a337,000, from the Premiership player in the toilets of the Funky Buddha in London last June. Yorke handed over the watch fearing that Kessie was armed when he moved his hand towards his jacket. Kessie then pushed Yorke into a toilet cubicle where he tried unsuccessfully to remove his necklace before fleeing. Yorke gave chase and eventually recovered his watch after a tussle at Green Park tube station nearby. Sentencing Kessie at Southwark crown court, Judge Peter Rook QC told him: \"There can be no doubt that this was a thoroughly frightening experience for the victim.\" He was also given a six-month sentence for a separate offence of possessing ammunition, to run consecutively. Kessie, of Wood Green, north London, who runs a security company, had admitted one count of robbery. At the time of the robbery Kessie had been on bail over the possession of two modified blank bullets discovered at his home, which he subsequently claimed he had found there and was intending to make into a necklace. Opening the prosecution's case yesterday about the robbery, Andrew McGee described how Kessie had approached Yorke from behind in the toilets. Kessie had asked him: \"Do you know who I am?\" Mr McGee said: \"Mr Kessie was holding his hand inside his jacket pocket. \"Mr Yorke became nervous, fearing that Mr Kessie may have a weapon of some description on him. \"Because Mr Yorke feared that the defendant had a weapon, he took his watch off and then gave it to him.\" The judge accepted that Kessie might not have known that the watch was worth so much. He added: \"I accept that you did not use a weapon. However, it was plainly a very intimidating experience for your victim. \"Furthermore, your action of putting your hand towards your jacket pocket certainly led the victim to believe that you were armed.\" The court heard that Kessie had a string of convictions, mainly for driving offences, dating back to 1996 including a six-month jail term in 2000. In mitigation, Tyrone Belger said his client was \"genuinely remorseful\" for what he had done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
