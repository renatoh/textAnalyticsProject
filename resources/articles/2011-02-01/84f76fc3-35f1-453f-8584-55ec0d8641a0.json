The Arsenal goalkeeper recently took some delight in using Twitter to indulge in a spot of Ashley Cole-bashing, after the Chelsea defender missed the decisive kick in an FA Cup penalty shoot-out against Everton. To his ever-growing band of followers, Szczesny tweeted: \"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's just Ashley throwing Chelsea out of the FA Cup.\" Earlier, he had nailed his colours to the mast. \"Love watching penalties. C'mon Everton!!!\" And so when Szczesny got into the awful tangle with Laurent Koscielny that handed the Carling Cup to Birmingham City on Sunday, the response in the twittersphere was predictable \u2013 even if it looked as though Koscielny was the more guilty party. Szczesny has been warned by Arsenal to lay off the Twitter mischief yet there is little doubt that he can handle it. The 20-year-old loves a joke and he would tell you that it is more extreme in the lower leagues; he can recount one or two tales from his time on loan at Brentford last season. As Arsenal plot a way to bounce back from Sunday, those at the club who know Szczesny best have few worries. It felt significant that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger announced immediately after the defeat that the Pole, his No1, would start in the FA Cup replay at home to Leyton Orient on Wednesday. Manuel Almunia started the first match. Wenger appears keen to give Szczesny no time to dwell on his part in the mix-up that allowed Obafemi Martins to score Birmingham's 89th-minute winner, or on his erratic performance in general. But the player has toughness in his genes. His father, Maciej, was a Poland goalkeeper and he is Szczesny's inspiration. The pair talk after each game and the father does not always pass down soothing words. \"My dad has always been very helpful with good advice and he still helps me,\" Szczesny said. \"I call him after every single game and he is very critical, if I am honest with you. That's usually the way dads are, isn't it?\" Szczesny embarked upon his goalkeeping career under the burden of being his father's son. Comparisons were frequently made and in Poland they still are. Szczesny has learned to blot out the background noise and doing so has helped to sharpen his focus. He has emerged as one of the symbols of Arsenal's fresh hope as they enter the defining months of the season and there remains a fervent belief in the dressing room that they can end the club's six-year wait for a trophy, even if the bookmakers now make them odds-on to finish empty-handed. Daunting tests loom, against Barcelona at Camp Nou in the Champions League and against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the FA Cup, if they get past Orient. For Szczesny, the challenge is to prove that he can take the Birmingham setback in his stride. The smart money says that he can. However, the Wembley disappointment has evidently needled Arsenal's players. The midfielder Jack Wilshere used Twitter to reveal his annoyance at how Barry Ferguson had ruffled Koscielny's hair as he sat hunched in despair after Martins' goal. \"Well done to the BCFC player who slapped Koscielny on the head when they scored, very big of you,\" he tweeted. Furthermore, the results of a scan on Robin van Persie's knee are anxiously awaited. The striker damaged the joint in the act of scoring the equaliser and is a doubt for the match in Barcelona next Tuesday. Yet the overriding theme from the players after Wembley was that they would not allow one crushing loss to derail a promising season. The striker Marouane Chamakh said: \"Mentally, this is a huge blow but we really have to focus on our other targets now. We're lucky that we can play again straight away. We have to forget the final quickly and make sure that the defeat doesn't stay on our minds. We will bounce back. We still have a lot of big games to play and we will fight on until the end.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
