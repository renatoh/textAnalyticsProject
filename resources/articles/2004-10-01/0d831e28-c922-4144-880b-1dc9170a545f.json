The retail group, which he bought for just \u00a3200m four years ago, published results for the year to the end of March showing record underlying profits of \u00a3112m, up 6%. That increase was achieved despite flat sales. Mr Green said the boost was instead due to \"better stock control, less markdown, less terminal stock, quicker speed to market - just being more efficient\". He also paid tribute to \"the continued loyalty, commitment and passion shown by our 14,000 people\". Bhs is paying out \u00a342.75m as a final dividend, of which Mr Green - who owns 94% of the business - will get the lion's share. The final dividend comes on top of \u00a3157m paid at the halfway stage. In a move that will increase the pressure on his former friend Stuart Rose at Marks &amp; Spencer, Mr Green, whose \u00a39bn bid proposal for M&amp;S was spurned by its board in the summer, revealed that recent comparative sales at the chain had climbed 1.3%. On Tuesday M&amp;S announced a 7.7% drop in its underlying sales of clothing and homewares. The billionaire's summer battle to win control of M&amp;S was his second tilt at what was once the UK's leading retailer. Under Takeover Panel rules he is free to make another bid in January. Mr Green has also been suggested as a possible buyer for the ailing Sainsbury's supermarket chain - he made an approach a year ago but was rebuffed - but yesterday he said: \"I'm resting. I'm not looking at anything at this moment, I'm just trading the businesses.\" He said Bhs had the potential to deliver much more. The chain generated sales of only \u00a3200 a square foot, while Next achieved \u00a3600. \"If we did an extra \u00a350, then \u00a3111m in profit would become \u00a3200m.\" The entrepreneur also owns the Arcadia group of fashion brands, which includes Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Top Shop and Burton. It is due to produce its financial results next Thursday. Elsewhere in the retail sector, Peacocks and Burberry - which operate at opposite ends of the high street spending spectrum, announced strong sales figures. Peacocks - which recently acquired the Fragrance Shop chain - said strong sales had offset problems at its downmarket bonmarch\u00e9 chain. Bonmarch\u00e9 sales, on a same-store basis, dropped 7.2%, but Peacocks and the Fragrance Shop recorded increases of 9% and 9.5% respectively. At Burberry, underlying first-half sales were ahead 14%, powered by retail expansion and the new Burberry Brit men's perfume. Chief financial officer Stacey Cartwright said Chinese shoppers were \"literally queueing outside the door\" of the Hong Kong store."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
