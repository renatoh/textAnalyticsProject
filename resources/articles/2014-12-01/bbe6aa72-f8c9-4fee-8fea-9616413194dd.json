The prime minister strongly defended his most senior adviser, Peta Credlin, after MPs and some ministers privately raised concerns about centralisation of decision making in Abbott\u2019s office. Abbott said people could tell him if they had a problem with his office, because his staff did what he asked them to do. He said it was the same office that \u201cran a very effective opposition\u201d and \u201cgot an enormous amount done this year\u201d. Abbott told the ABC in an interview on Friday: \u201cDo you really think that my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was P-e-t-e-r as opposed to P-e-t-a?\u201d When the interviewer, Lyndal Curtis, told Abbott his comments were a message to his colleagues, the prime minister said: \u201cI think people need to take a long, hard look at themselves with some of these criticisms.\u201d The comments follow reports of tension between Abbott\u2019s office and the deputy Liberal leader, Julie Bishop, and Coalition members criticising decisions made by the prime minister\u2019s office. The social services minister, Kevin Andrews, said Credlin was doing \u201ca bloody good job in difficult circumstances\u201d and colleagues should \u201cnot get diverted by personalities\u201d. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of mischief making going on at the present time,\u201d Andrews said on Friday. \u201cLet me be blunt about this: we\u2019re not changing leader, we\u2019re not changing treasurer, we\u2019re not changing the chief of staff. Our job is to get back to the task that the people of Australia elected us to do and that is to fix up the enormous mess that we\u2019ve inherited from the Labor party.\u201d Late last year a Liberal National party senator went public with his concerns. Ian Macdonald, who was demoted from the outer ministry after the 2013 election, told the Senate the prime minister\u2019s office displayed an \u201cobsessive centralised control phobia\u201d over every aspect of parliament and he would not be bossed around by \u201cunelected advisers\u201d. The former Howard government minister Peter Reith said Coalition MPs had raised genuine concerns about centralisation in Abbott\u2019s office. Reith said Abbott should rethink the role of his staffers in communicating with members of the backbench. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit of a mistake on Tony\u2019s part to throw in the gender claim, quite frankly,\u201d Reith told Sky News on Friday. \u201cI think there is some reform necessary [on how the prime minister\u2019s office operates] and Tony would be wise to put to the side gender issues and focus on genuine concerns and worries people have had, generally on the backbench but also some ministers.\u201d The former Gillard government minister Craig Emerson told Sky News: \u201cOh the irony of Tony Abbott playing a gender card. He spent three years criticising Julia Gillard for speaking about women\u2019s issues and the treatment of women, condemning her for talking about the treatment of women, and then he plays the gender card. The longer you stay in and around politics the less you\u2019re surprised about the way the wheel turns.\u201d The Palmer United party leader, Clive Palmer, was widely criticised in June for personally targeting Credlin in a speech to parliament about paid parental leave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
