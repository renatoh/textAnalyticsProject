As a pitch for the long-awaited Big Novel on the psychosocial deformations of Iraq and the war on terror, it knocks the imaginative spots off Saturday. You will stay haunted for days by the image of a London in which prepubescent, middle-class young Wasps start to disappear of their own free will to join a mysterious, global and murderous anti-western insurgency. The ideology of Miller's lost boys is an incandescent mix derived from PlayStation violence, Iraq news footage, Peter Pan, William Burroughs's Wild Boys and anti-G8 millenarianism. They are \"the wild boys, the never-never boys, the boys who saw too much, the boys who will not be lied to ... cleansing ourselves of the sickness of the world we knew\". The sense of dread as these self-righteously amoral young killers gather in the encroaching darkness, as the rational adult world is invaded by the chthonic forces of vengeful youth, is brilliantly done. Whether the vision is enough to carry a whole novel, though, is another matter. Miller essentially unfolds the same material three times, from the points of view of Timmy (a bullied day-school boy), Buxton (a sketchily drawn private investigator hired by Timmy's father to investigate his disappearance), and the father himself, Arthur Dashwood (a senior western oil exec who was recently kidnapped but swiftly and mysteriously released in Iraq). The central section, in which Dashwood listens to Buxton's evidence, is unconvincing, far too long and relies totally on the hackneyed horror-genre device of a series of tapes, progressively more haunted-sounding, leading up to a fatal silence. A bigger problem is that in a book supposed to yield insight into the mindset of the lost boys, the central boy, Timmy, is a cipher. In the third of the book seen from his point of view, you very rarely believe in him. Twelve-year-olds, however sensitive, do not think that \"a grey pall overhung the city, as if God had covered the sky with concrete\". Miller's excellently wrought build of horror (the story archly namechecks HP Lovecraft in case we miss the point) is sadly undermined by the lost boys being so patently justified in the author's eyes. He can't resist pleading their case, rather than leaving them as the scarily incomprehensible agents of chiliastic doom. Where Lord of the Flies leaves a pregnant ambiguity as to whether its boys are so beastly because of the war around them or just because they are, well, boys, Miller trumpets a thoroughly familiar PC message about the sins of the west coming home to roost. The decision to have Timmy's father directly involved in Iraq and Big Oil is a poor one: the specificity of Dashwood's culpability always hamstrings the effort to present a general cultural malaise, and having him descend into a sort of Abu Ghraib-style S&amp;M orgy shifts the focus badly away from the vibrant image of the lost boys into would-be darker but really rather banal realms of adult guilt. As a mysterious and visionary novella, this would have been excellent and truly memorable. But in trying to muscle up a grade, it becomes too weak and too obvious for there to be any need, as yet, to update the celestial map of the capital's novelists. \u00b7 James Hawes's My Little Armalite is published next month by Cape."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
