Kasper Schmeichel might never achieve the career success of his father but the teenager has already shown himself to be a chip off the old block. \"I think he has handled the pressure very well,\" Sven-Goran Eriksson, City's manager, said yesterday of Peter Schmeichel's 20-year-old son, who has kept clean sheets in his first two Premier League appearances as well as showing an uncanny resemblance to the man Sir Alex Ferguson once described as \"the buy of the century\". At \u00a3550,000 Ferguson may have been right. Schmeichel junior kept out Stephen Pearson in City's 1-0 defeat of Derby County on Wednesday with the famous \"star jump\" that was patented by his father during his eight years at Manchester United. The young Dane has also copied the technique of spitting into his goalkeeping gloves to help the ball stick. And the way he bawled out City's captain, Richard Dunne, after a badly defended corner suggests he has learned something else from his dad's old videos. \"Sometimes it can be difficult for a player to come through when they have such a famous father,\" said Eriksson, \"but I don't think I could fault anything from Kasper's two games in goal.\" Schmeichel joined Manchester City as a trainee four years ago but started this summer as City's fourth-choice goalkeeper, having spent loan periods last season at Bury in League Two and at Falkirk in the Scottish Premierleague. Schmeichel has been promoted to the team because Andreas Isaksson has a broken thumb, Joe Hart's pre-season was interrupted by injury and Nicky Weaver has moved to Charlton Athletic. Eriksson has been trying to bring in a new goalkeeper but his failure to do so left Schmeichel to make his debut in the win at West Ham last weekend. Of course it was at United that Peter played so successfully in the 90s. Three years after leaving Old Trafford he joined City for a season in which they finished in the top half of the Premier League, their best finish in a decade. Now Kasper must prepare for a test of nerve when United visit the City of Manchester stadium on Sunday. \"I've known him for only one month but he has already shown me he's an extremely confident boy,\" said Eriksson. \"I'm sure he will cope with the situation.\" In fact, City's coaching staff say they are amazed by the teenager's self-belief - another characteristic he shares with his father. Yet there is one notable difference. While Peter, now 43, stands at 6ft 4in, Kasper is not even 6ft. \"He's not the tallest of goalkeepers,\" Eriksson accepted, \"but he is quick and talented and his feet are fantastic. He can kick the ball wherever he wants and that is important in the modern game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
