A high-school reunion allows Thomas to resolve several of the show's loose ends, yet the urge to give recurring characters their moment keeps staying the momentum of the whodunnit Kristen Bell's heroine comes to investigate. There's something semi-watchable about seeing these semi-attractive people say semi-amusing, self-aware things, such as TV was in that post-Buffy, post-Dawson moment before the paunchy antiheroes muscled in, but anyone preferring novelty to nostalgia may be let down by a film shot, scored and scaled like a feature-length special: a James Franco cameo does not a real movie make."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
