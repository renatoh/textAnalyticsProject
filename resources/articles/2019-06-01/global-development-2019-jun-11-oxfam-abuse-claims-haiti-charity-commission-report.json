The Charity Commission report surveyed 7,000 pieces of evidence related to allegations that Oxfam had covered up its investigation into staff paying for sex while working on the response to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. It is the most detailed report produced by the commission. The Haiti scandal prompted resignations from Oxfam GB\u2019s chief executive, Mark Goldring, and its deputy chief executive, Penny Lawrence, and caused the charity to lose UK aid. In the immediate aftermath of the allegations, the charity lost thousands of donors. The allegations also placed the aid sector under intense scrutiny, and prompted the UK government to host a safeguarding summit to improve accountability. \u201cWhat went wrong in Haiti did not happen in isolation. Our inquiry demonstrates that, over a period of years, Oxfam\u2019s internal culture tolerated poor behaviour, and at times lost sight of the values it stands for,\u201d said Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission, which set up an inquiry into the allegations last year. The commission expressed concern over Oxfam\u2019s internal investigation into the claims that staff in Haiti had paid for sex, and over its response to separate accusations relating to abuse of children in Haiti. Two emails, dated July and August 2011 and said to be from a 13-year-old girl about herself and a 12-year-old girl, made allegations of physical and sexual abuse involving Oxfam staff. The email stated that the two minors had been paid for sex and had been \u201c\u2026 beaten and used by two men who I know work for you \u2026\u201d It was suspected by Oxfam at the time \u2013 but not then proven \u2013 that the allegations were not genuine, according to the report. However, the Charity Commission said the charity \u201cshould have tried harder to identify the source of the concerns and followed up the allegations\u201d. Last year, the emails were referred to the National Crime Agency by Oxfam and the commission. Speaking on behalf of former Oxfam GB trustees and senior executives, Alison Talbot, partner and head of national charities at law firm Winckworth Sherwood, said the emails were investigated by Oxfam\u2019s investigations team but \u201cwere proven to originate from outside Haiti\u201d. The commission issued Oxfam with an official warning, which will appear on the commission\u2019s register, and issued the charity with directions to improve. Caroline Thomson, Oxfam GB\u2019s chair of trustees, said the commission\u2019s findings into the organisation\u2019s behaviour \u201care very uncomfortable\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat happened in Haiti was shameful.\u201d The watchdog stopped short of accusing Oxfam of a coverup over the allegations, but said the charity should have been \u201cfuller and franker\u201d in its reports to donors and regulators. Its handling of the allegations \u201cwas influenced by a desire to protect Oxfam GB\u2019s reputation, and to protect donor and stakeholder relationships\u201d, the inquiry said. An internal investigation into allegations that staff members paid for sex was launched by Oxfam in 2011. However, the commission expressed serious concerns about the experience of the investigators and the resources they were given. During the charity\u2019s internal investigation, information was leaked, compromising the safety and confidentiality of a witness, and leading to witness intimidation, the commission found. In its reports to the regulator, Oxfam said categorically that misconduct did not involve beneficiaries. However, the commission concluded otherwise. It added that the charity should have done more to investigate whether children were among those involved. Oxfam\u2019s investigation concluded that four members of staff either did pay for sex or were suspected of doing so, including on charity premises. Three men, including the country director, Roland van Hauwermeiren, were allowed to resign, while four were sacked for gross misconduct. The watchdog said it had found evidence to indicate that Oxfam \u201cencouraged and facilitated\u201d Van Hauwermeiren\u2019s resignation, warning that this suggested \u201cmore senior staff would be treated more leniently\u201d. The inquiry also examined Oxfam\u2019s wider approach to safeguarding and concluded that the charity\u2019s own commitments and promises in the past had not always been matched by its resources. The commission instructed Oxfam trustees to submit an action plan to the regulator on how it would address concerns about its previous conduct, in an effort to \u201crepair public trust and confidence\u201d in the charity. Stephenson added that \u201ccultural and systemic change is required\u201d to address the failings identified in the report. In a statement, the charity said it has tripled its investment in safeguarding, created a new director of safeguarding post and accepted 79 detailed recommendations made by an independent review. \u201cOur first concern is for the security and safety of those we serve,\u201d said Thomson. \u201cWe acknowledge and admire the courage of survivors, and ask anyone who has experienced or witnessed abuse to come forward. Where there is evidence of wrongdoing, we will take the firmest of action, including by reporting allegations to the relevant authorities where that is appropriate.\u201d Talbot said: \u201cAs trustees and senior executives, those of us then in office were appalled when in 2011 we found out about the behaviour of some of Oxfam\u2019s staff posted to Haiti. At the time, Oxfam was delivering water to half a million people in Haiti. These members of staff let Oxfam, and our beneficiaries, down badly. We apologise to all those affected.\u201d She added: \u201cWe recognise that the Charity Commission has identified weaknesses in the handling of the events in Haiti. We implemented a detailed action plan to address the wider issues identified by the investigation both in Haiti, and across our international programmes. As trustees and senior executives at the time, we were determined to tackle sexual exploitation and abuse, and we established a number of programmes and initiatives to prevent and identify safeguarding issues. \u201cSafeguarding is and remains a huge issue for all charities, and the commission has pointed out the need for greater resource, more rigorous investigatory procedures, and senior oversight and accountability. We recognise today that our efforts in 2011 and subsequently were insufficient, especially in the light of all of the information available to the Charity Commission in the course of this statutory inquiry.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
