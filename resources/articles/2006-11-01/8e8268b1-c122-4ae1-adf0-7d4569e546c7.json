I don't mean that it is odd because it doesn't correspond to the facts: obviously, there are many unbelievers, and an infinite number of theological disputes. If God is responsible for the state of the world, then the infidels and heretics must serve his purposes. It's just that no one has ever come up with a convincing and generally satisfying explanation for what these might be. The two which seem to come up most often are the polite Oxford version, that God wants us to love him, and this is only possible if we have free will; and the robust Calvinist one, which holds that if God wants to make some people hopeless sinners, unable even to want his Grace, well, he's God, so that's all right. On the other hand, the Dawkins-type explanation that all this is stuff and nonsense, without any rhyme or reason, doesn't seem to make sense either. Theories that simply dismiss religious belief as a form of insanity have no predictive value. They don't explain why some impossible things are more easily, more generally, and more often believed than others. Of course, there is a polite atheistic theory, which holds that though it is all stuff and nonsense, we should respect those who believe this, in some vague, unpolitical sense; and it was a perfect example of this polite theory which suggested to me a real answer to the question of why anyone believes God wants to hide from us. It was an essay by professor Richard P Sloan of Columbia University that we should not measure the effects of religious practice scientifically even though we could. \"Religion and science are independent approaches to knowledge,\" he wrote; \"and neither can be reduced to the other. Religion and science are fundamentally different, with the former relying on faith as a source of wisdom and the latter demanding evidence. Religious truths generally are considered to be enduring and not subject to change.\" It is important and right that religion and science cannot be reduced to each other. Science is not bad or inadequate religion, and religion is not failed science. But they can both be studied as social enterprises. It's certainly not true that what distinguishes \"religion\" from \"science\" is that \"religion\" is untrue and its belief unwarranted by the evidence. When sociologists study science they find a social activity that has all sorts of myths taken on authority (including the myth that scientists take nothing on authority). On the other hand; and self-conscious modern religious organisations spend a lot of time researching the effectiveness of their various marketing techniques een the means used to promote charismatic experiences. Parts of the Roman Catholc church even study the effectiveness of intercessory prayer quite honestly. Where else would one learn that the rate of miracles attested at Lourdes is indistinguishable from that of chance? That's to say that inexplicable cures do happen there, but no more than anywhere else. To class them as miracles is to make a statement about their role in people's lives. This is the sort of study that Professor Sloan disapproves of. He writes: \"Without a doubt, we could conduct a study contrasting the health effects of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, for example. It could be done in precisely the same way that researchers have examined the effects of higher versus lower frequency of attendance at religious services, or greater or lower frequency of private prayer or reading the Bible or listening to religious radio programming. From the scientific perspective, there is no fundamental difference between using religious denomination or religious attendance as the predictor variable.\" So far, no argument at all. It is in the next paragraph that his argument jumps off the rails: \"Although science allows us to conduct such a study, ethics and religion ought to tell us how ridiculous such a comparison would be ... Even if we could, hypothetically, demonstrate that Protestant prayer is better for one's health than Catholic prayer, why would we ever want to do so?\" There are plenty of CiF readers who would reply that it would get rid of Catholics. More generally, if it could be shown that some kinds of religious practice are better for you than others then we should urge everyone to take them up -- and even without the encouragement of liberal newspapers, they would spread through the market. How could this not be a good thing? Professor Sloan says because this would exacerbate religious tensions; an answer that on one level makes no sense at all. Why should the unsuccessful believers resent that other people's prayers were answered? Why not simply convert to the God who delivers? In competitive religious markets, like American or African evangelicalism, everyone is constantly advertising the efficiency of their prayers, on the reasonable grounds that this makes them more attractive. I assume that Professor Sloan, like me, supposes that no prayer to a particular deity is actually more efficient than any other, and none more effective than chance, which makes his reticence even odder. There is only one explanation that makes it look sensible not to conduct comparative studies into the power of prayer. Only if we realise that the purpose of theology is not so much to convert people, as not to do so: that the real purpose is to fill the world with unbelievers, does our intuition that it is unfair to compare Gods make sense. In this light, a God who could reliably work miracles (or one who could compel belief from infidels) is like a Russian billionaire buying into the football league. He destroys the point of the competition. The game no longer becomes a test of skills or fervour, but just of money. The competition between religions is much more serious than football in the places where it is taken seriously. Even English football supporters are slow to massacre their opponents. But there have been places where sporting and religious rivalry coincided: sixth century Byzantium and Twentieth Century Glasgow. In both those cases, religion was a way of lining up tribally; and the winning tribe obtained hard material benefits from their political dominance. The fact that there is no rational basis for choosing between gods is precisely what makes them such a good way to decide political questions. Arguing about the kinds of things that cannot by their nature be decided or susceptible to proof is much the best way to ensure that what is really being measured is something else: political power, debating skill, or determination. So it is not irrational for religion to spread in the modern world and why we can expect it to spread still more. If theological disputes gain popularity as a way of fighting over resources at a time of political change, this is going to be a good century for religious correspondents. Even the Church of England might revive -- as a way of expressing an English identity that was firmly anti-Islamic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
