It's set in a nowhere time and place, a sort of post-Katrina New Orleans-meets-Kevin Costner's Waterworld, where our six-year-old narrator observes her father's illness and her bayou community's plight with dreamy detachment. It's a film that takes great risks \u2013 bare-bones story, non-professional actors, prehistoric creatures, jerky camerawork \u2013 but it all pays off beautifully. Ginger &amp; Rosa (12A) (Sally Potter, 2012, UK/Den/Can/Cro) Elle Fanning, Alice Englert, Alessandro Nivola. 90 mins Two 1960s girlfriends come of age in very different ways in this outstanding drama, shadowed by anxieties over the nuclear family and the nuclear threat. Beautifully shot and powerfully acted, it sits neatly between Fish Tank and An Education. Frankenweenie (PG) (Tim Burton, 2012, US) Charlie Tahan, Catherine O'Hara, Winona Ryder. 87 mins Burton takes his retrovision horror fixation out for walkies with a black-and-white, stop-motion tale of a 50s boy and his reanimated dog. It's detailed enough, but hardly a bold leap. Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (PG) (Eric Darnell, Tom McGrath, Conrad Vernon, 2012, US) Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith. 93 mins The zoo animals wash up in Europe and run off with the circus in this latest in-yer-face package, which, depending on your outlook, is either a psychedelic paean to inclusivity or a carbonated sugar-rush of junk-entertainment. 5 Broken Cameras (15) (Emad Burnat, Guy Davidi, 2011, Pal/Isr/Fra/Neth) 94 mins A Palestinian man documents Israeli intrusions on his West Bank village, and the sacrifice of his filming equipment as well as land and life, distilled from years of amateur footage. Inherently biased, it's still a powerful, tragic account. Flying Swords Of Dragon Gate (15) (Tsui Hark, 2012, Chi) Jet Li, Zhou Xun, Chen Kun. 122 mins It's not just swords, everything seems to be flying in this kinetic 3D epic: fists, arrows, people, crockery \u2026 A sequel to Hark's classic Dragon Gate Inn, it's a convoluted desert adventure that's really all about the action. The Rolling Stones: Crossfire Hurricane (U) (Brett Morgen, 2012, UK/US) 150 mins The rock legends struggle to tell us something we don't know in this horse's-mouth account of their half-century together. Still, there's archive footage and exclusive access galore. Paranormal Activity 4 (15) (Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman, 2012, US) Katie Featherston, 87 mins The horror franchise continues its steady descent into irrelevance, with more CCTV scares and spooky kids to bring the story on \u2013 if anyone's still following it. Student Of The Year (12A) (Karan Johar, 2012, Ind) Siddarth Malhotra, Sana Saeed, 146 mins A new generation of Bollywood hopefuls compete in track, field and love.
