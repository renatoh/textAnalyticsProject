With heavy snow blanketing the north\u2011east, Newcastle United made a concerted effort to persuade the local police and city council to give today's game the green light. If the fee from Sky television was one incentive, Chris Hughton's demeanour suggested the Geordie camp felt this might be a very good time to catch Chelsea cold. Yet while Andy Carroll, Cheik Tiot\u00e9, Steven Taylor and team-mates reminded Ancelotti how much he really is missing Frank Lampard, Michael Essien and John Terry, the London side averted an embarrassment comparable to that recently experienced by a charter pilot whose plane skidded off the runway at Newcastle airport. By the time Chelsea arrived back at the terminal building for the flight home it had been closed in the wake of a blizzard. Not that their aircraft even made it to the tarmac \u2013 it was already stranded at Aberdeen. Ancelotti may feel this campaign has hit a similar impasse but at least he avoided a defeat which would have had the headline writers deeming his club in crisis and his future uncertain. Stamford Bridge officials were quick to pour scorn on reports that Pep Guardiola was being lined up to replace the Italian \u2013 it is surely no coincidence the Barcelona manager is negotiating a new contract at Camp Nou \u2013 but Ancelotti appreciates that, at Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, no one is indispensable. \"The coach is always the last to know these things,\" he said, with a rather world\u2011weary shrug. Considering his team stand second in the Premier League talk of regime change sounds ridiculous but Russian oligarchs grow impatient when their playthings collect a mere four points from five games and come within a whisker of slipping to a third successive league defeat. Salomon Kalou's equaliser not only prevented such ignominy but ensured that the long, slow, coach journey down the A1 endured by Chelsea tonight was less grim than it might have been. If Premier League footballers rarely travel any sort of distance by coach these days \u2013 flying is de rigueur \u2013 leading sides hardly ever configure themselves in 4-4-2 formations. So it was slightly startling to see Ancelotti arrange his players in that supposedly old\u2011fashioned system. The idea was to nullify the service to Andy Carroll \u2013 and despite Carroll scoring a comedic opener courtesy of Alex's backpass, it largely worked. \"I changed today because we wanted to close crosses for Carroll,\" said Ancelotti. \"And it put Ramires in a better position. He has the confidence to play in the middle.\" Defensively, the gameplan was sound enough, with Branislav Ivanovic enjoying a very decent afternoon at centre half, but it fell down in central midfield where Ramires and Mikel John Obi frequently found themselves checked by the quietly excellent Tiot\u00e9. The Ivorian's reassuring holding presence was also a comfort to the returning, ring-rusty, home centre\u2011halves Steven Taylor and Sol Campbell. Few would have believed Taylor had not played a first team game for 10 months and Campbell has barely figured this season. \"Defensively, we were outstanding,\" said Hughton. He could say the same about his own management of shoestring backroom resources. Working with the division's smallest support staff, Newcastle's manager \u2013 without an assistant since Colin Calderwood's departure for Hibernian five weeks ago \u2013 would probably swap a few of Ancelotti's problems for his formidable workload. Especially as John Terry is now approaching full fitness and will be back training with the first team this week, when Alex is expected to undergo knee surgery in Brazil. \"Next week is an important one for Terry,\" acknowledged Ancelotti. \"Having him back will be a very great help.\" It would have been similarly handy had Kalou not missed an inviting late chance but, as Hughton said, a draw was \"fair\". His opponent saw the result as more fair to middling. \"We are happy for the performance but we are not happy,\" Ancelotti said. \"We did not start well and for this reason the game was more difficult. Our reaction took time but then it was good. We play good football yet, at this moment, we are not able to convert our chances. But we didn't lose; this is the important thing.\" Right now, Chelsea really are grateful for small mercies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
