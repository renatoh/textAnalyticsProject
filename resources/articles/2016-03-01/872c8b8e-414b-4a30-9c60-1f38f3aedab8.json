And best of all for the Australian economy, Chinese visitors spend more than anyone else. The swings and roundabouts of the economy really become apparent when you look at the exchange rate. The low Australia dollar helps exporters, as it makes our goods relatively cheaper compared with other nations, but when that lower dollar is largely being driven by low prices for commodities it\u2019s not a great help to our largest exporters of iron ore and other minerals. But the low dollar is absolute manna from heaven for the tourism and educational industries. A low dollar makes international travel more expensive, thus keeping more Australian tourists at home rather than overseas, and it makes coming to Australia a very inviting proposition for those from overseas. The same holds for international students \u2013 the lower our dollar is, the further their home currency stretches. Despite some recent upticks in the strength of our currency, from 2013 through to 2015 the value of the dollar fell against most of our trading partners: These falls have led to a reinvigoration of our tourism sector, with last year seeing an 11% rise in the number of short-term international visitors, almost 40% of which was due to visitors from China: In 2015 there were 531,700 more short-term arrivals than in 2014 and 196,700 came from China. In the 12 months to January 2016 there were 564,200 more arrivals than in the 12 months to January 2015 and 210,400 (37%) of those came from China. In January overall there were 66,200 more visitors to Australia than there was in the same month in 2015, and 26,600 of those came from China. China is fast approaching New Zealand as the largest source of visitors, and that is good news for our economy because Chinese visitors bring more money than those from other nations. The reason is the type of visitors. Not everyone comes to Australia for a holiday. Some come to visit relatives and friends (still a holiday, but one more likely to seeing people staying a bit longer but spending a bit less because they spend more time staying in someone\u2019s house rather than a hotel), others are here for business, some for employment and for education. The big growth in the past year has been for employment and education, with holidays coming in third. But in terms of sheer numbers, holidaying is the overwhelming reason why people come to Australia for a short visit. Thus while there has been a 14% increase in such visits, that accounted for two-thirds of the total increase in visitors into Australia throughout 2015: But while numbers are great, and it is wonderful that people like to come to our country, what really matters from an economic sense is that they come with money to spend. Foreign visitors spending money in Australia actually counts as exports as it is essentially money coming into our economy. And on this score, as with the other big Australian export of minerals, China is the dominant player: According to Tourism Research Australia, spending by Chinese visitors in 2015 grew by a staggering 48% over 2014, and accounted for a quarter of all spending. And while Chinese visitors are the biggest spenders as a group, they are also the biggest spenders on average: This is because of the reasons Chinese come to Australia. As the largest proportion of people coming to Australia do so for a holiday, such visitors account for the largest share of spending. Holiday-makers spent $14.3bn while in Australia in 2015, compared with $8.7bn spent by those here for education reasons: But those who are here for their education spend a great deal more on average than any other group \u2013 $17,721 per person in 2015 compared with $8,008 by those here for employment and just $2,499 by those here for a holiday. And this is where the Chinese really jump out as the big spenders. Where 64% of Japanese visitors are here for a holiday, only 54% of Chinese are. Similarly while 43% of those from the UK and 34% from New Zealand are here to see family or friends, only 20% of Chinese visitors are. While a mere 2% of visitors from across the Tasman or from the UK are here to attend education, 15% of Chinese are here to study: The importance of Chinese to our education export market is clear when we compare the number of Chinese student here each year since 2005 with students from other nations: And what is more, those Chinese students also spend more on average than most other student visitors. While the big spending holiday-makers are those from the UK ($3,958 on average in 2015), in all other categories Chinese visitors spend the most: It all adds up to a nice export earner and one that will continue to rise in importance as the Chinese middle class continues to grow. Given travel services account for nearly 15% of our exports \u2013 almost as much as the rural sector \u2013 it will continue to be a valuable part of our economy especially due to the labour-intensive nature of tourism-related services: Given the importance of the Chinese market to our tourism and educational sector, you can also be sure it is one that won\u2019t be taken for granted by governments, businesses or universities. Australian might have a heck of a lot of iron ore and coal compared with most nations, but we don\u2019t have any comparative advantage on universities or tourist spots. And it is always worth remembering that while we are relatively close to parts of China, a flight from Beijing to Heathrow is 20 minutes shorter than one to Sydney."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
