Those players were glad he was theirs when the right-back, a \u00a321.5m recruit from Atalanta, opened the scoring at the Hawthorns en route to a 3-0 win. \u201cI have to try and continue on that path and don\u2019t stop after just one game,\u201d says a player for whom the cliche \u201chit the ground running\u201d could have been invented. Running is one of the things the Belgian does best, his dynamism and intensity a quality that makes him so well suited to his name \u2013 Castagne happens to be slang for fight in French, his mother tongue \u2013 and also to Leicester\u2019s high-energy style. Funnily enough, Thomas Meunier, the Borussia Dortmund player with whom Castagne competes for the right-back slot in his national team, started out at the same club as Castagne, Royal Excelsior Virton, a quirk that gets Castagne wondering. \u201cIt is in a small province and you don\u2019t have a lot of players coming out of there,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the mentality of the region is always about working hard and keeping running, and that fits a bit the role of full-backs.\u201d That mentality and his ability made him an ideal recruit three years ago for Atalanta, where he took a while to establish himself before becoming part of the side that took Italy and Europe by storm last season, finishing third in Serie A and reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League. The player says Atalanta\u2019s success was partly due to their determination to bring a small measure of joy to Bergamo, which was particularly hard hit by coronavirus, and also to the running the team did during lockdown. \u201cIt was a tough time for everyone there, especially in the city,\u201d he says, adding that the one positive of that grim time was that he and his teammates could work out even more. \u201cWe received a treadmill and had to run every day. So we arrived [after lockdown] a lot more prepared than the other teams, that is why after 60 minutes we would kill other teams.\u201d When Leicester came calling, he had several reasons for welcoming the move. One was a yearning nurtured in childhood, when the appeal of the Premier League owed a lot to a glorious striker at Arsenal. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved Thierry Henry, he has been my idol since I was a young boy,\u201d says the 24-year-old, who will fulfil a dream of playing against Arsenal if picked for Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup tie at the King Power. He has already worked with Henry, who, says Castagne, did not disappoint during a stint as Belgium\u2019s assistant manager. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him that he was my hero but it was very good working with him. He was really nice, he wanted to be friends with the players.\u201d The prospect of working with Brendan Rodgers was another factor that lured Castagne to Leicester. Rodgers tried to sign the Belgian when he was manager of Celtic and kept an eye on him ever since. \u201cI wanted a coach with whom I can have a relationship,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can talk, he can help me work on my weaknesses and things like that. That\u2019s why I chose to come here because I had a really good impression of him.\u201d Atalanta\u2019s manager, Gian Piero Gasperini, did not offer that. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t speak to anyone,\u201d says Castagne. \u201cHe was very good tactically and had very good ideas but we just didn\u2019t have that type of relationship. It depends upon the player but for me I need the relationship. \u201cAfter the game I was asking: \u2018How did I do? What did I do well?\u2019 either to the assistant or the head coach, that would have helped with my confidence but I didn\u2019t get that at Atalanta. Now I\u2019m receiving it and it has been very good.\u201d So what weaknesses does he think Rodgers can help him strengthen? \u201cI can go faster in my execution,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot faster here than in Italy, so he\u2019s going to help me with that, to see more quickly where I can play the ball and where it\u2019s not possible. Also defensively, I can be better in one-v-one. That\u2019s something we are also working on.\u201d One of Castagne\u2019s qualities sometimes struck him as a curse: his versatility has led to him being deployed in a host of positions. He would like to settle on one role but Rodgers has told him he should remain adaptable. That will be especially important when Ricardo Pereira returns from injury. \u201cThey know I can play left and right in a [back] four or in a [back] three. [Rodgers] said it\u2019s going to be easier if they need to change something tactical and things like that. \u201cFor a player, it\u2019s not easy to always switch. But I\u2019ve done it at Atalanta and it\u2019s worked quite well. I can do it, it\u2019s not a problem for me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
