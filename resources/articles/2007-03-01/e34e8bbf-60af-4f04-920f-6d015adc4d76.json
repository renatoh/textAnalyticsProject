I don't think there was. Beneath all the violence and feedback, the Reid Brothers had an incredible ear for melody and an insouciant pop sensibility that their myriad imitators couldn't get near. This song is from an album they did with their sister Linda on vocals, recorded over 10 years in various friends' kitchens, and it's really brilliant; like an unplugged JAMC on a Sunday morning with a girl singer that's a bit stoned. To everybody bored and irritated by all the overcomplicated, jerky, spoddy indie rock sounds with skinny jeans that are around at the moment, Can't Stop The Rock is like a downer for the soul. Kings Of Leon On Call (RCA) Amid all the style magazine features and Noel Gallagher fanclub-ism, everybody seems to have totally missed the truth about these guys. They are four grumpy male models who sound like The Strokes doing Creedence Clearwater Revival covers. That's not to say they haven't done a couple of great numbers, but this dreary comeback song is a real wet noodle moment. It really accentuates the \"please take us seriously\" vibes that these guys need to drop as soon as possible. Buried beneath the veneer of super model blowjobs and free designer jeans there's a good band in there somewhere. Mel C I Want Candy (Redgirl) Doesn't she have enough money already? Jesus. What they've done here is taken a horn section straight out of an advert about microwaveable Nachos and got them to play over the top of a badly remade Bow Wow Wow song. This just doesn't just piss on the original song's grave. It exhumes the corpse, ties it to the back of a milk van and drags it through rush hour. Patrick Wolf The Magic Position (Loog) What's not to love about this guy? He dresses like a little boy who lives in a cuckoo clock and has an owl for a spiritual advisor. At times he verges on being a psychedelic Divine Comedy, but when he finds his stride, on winners like this, his music has the curious power of making you feel all hopeful and wistful about the drudgery of life. I'm not sure how he does it, or if I should admit that in public, but there you go. Methodist Centre One Nation Tory (Invisible Spies) Despite all the latent homosexuality involved in the skinhead Oi! Scene, there's never actually been a fully out-of-the-closet Oi! Band. Step forward east London's Methodist Centre. The band is two gays on drums and a straight guy on guitar who make pop Oi! songs about working in a really boring department of a city council and why the war and the Conservatives are bad. It's more of an art project than a real band but it's great for rowdy parties and on your headphones when your line manager has just bollocked you for being 15 minutes late on a Friday morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
