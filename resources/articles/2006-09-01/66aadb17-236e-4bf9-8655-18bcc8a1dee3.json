Ruth Palmer is a young British violinist who trained at the Royal College of Music. She organised this recording herself, arranging sponsorship and collaborating with director Tim Meara on the half-hour film about Shostakovich, which comes on the accompanying DVD. There's a whiff of designer chic about the presentation, and none of it would be significant if the performances were not so outstanding. Palmer tears into the ferociously demanding First Concerto in a way that none of the other versions released this year can match for intensity or, in the later movements, for poetic grandeur - and with the Philharmonia clearly galvanised by her playing, the results are spine-tingling. The late Violin Sonata inhabits an even more inward-looking world than the concerto, but Palmer is equally assured there, too. Altogether this is one of the most impressive Shostakovich discs to have appeared during the centenary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
