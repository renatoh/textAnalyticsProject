According to its makers, the Kurupt FM Podkast tackles \u201ca range of topics including technology, relationships, survival, fashion and the supernatural\u201d. Hopefully there will be lots of Chabuddy G-flavoured schemes, besides\u2026 Elsewhere, the podcast boom doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down anytime soon: according to stats from the US Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and PricewaterhouseCoopers, by 2021 the industry could likely generate $1bn, as tech giants including Google and Spotify continue to double down on their audio efforts. Hannah J Davies Picks of the week The Two Princes One of the most inventive scripted podcasts to drop in recent months comes from Gimlet, home of hits such as Heavyweight, Sandra and Reply All. Booksmart\u2019s Noah Galvin stars as Prince Rupert, who is trying to break a long-standing curse on his kingdom but is derailed by the handsome rival prince Amir. It stirs up all kinds of confusing emotions, which take this fantasy adventure to new depths. Christine Baranski and Matthew Rhys add their voices to a fairytale full of swashbuckling and teenage romance. Hannah Verdier Digging Deep With Robert Plant From Black Country mod to rock god to quixotic world-folk adventurer, former Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant has long exhibited a winning musical curiosity. For these seven fortnightly podcasts, ostensibly to promote, well, himself, he makes excellent company as he\u2019s coaxed by Matt Everitt into revisiting some of his most memorable collaborations and inspirations, taking in Nigel Kennedy, Alison Krauss and the thumb bone of bad King John (\u201cI\u2019ve seen it! It\u2019s under the altar at Worcester cathedral\u201d). Martin Horsfield Guardian Pick: Chips with Everything To say that Twitter can be a divisive place is a pretty mundane observation to make these days. And one only needs to look to Donald Trump\u2019s recent visit to see why. But not everyone on the platform is looking to divide. Some, including Hussein Kesvani - who appeared in this week\u2019s episode of Chips with Everything - are looking to build bridges. As Hussein tells Jordan Erica Webber, a couple of years ago, he started receiving anti-Islam messages from a Twitter account called \u2018True Brit\u2019. Intrigued by his Islamaphobic troll, a few months - and many messages - later, Hussein travelled to meet the man behind the account. To hear what happened next, make sure to have a listen. Max Sanderson Producer pick: Radio Menea Chosen by Ekaterina Ochagavia (Video Producer) A weekly music podcast by two friends with \u201cwildly different music tastes\u201d, Radio Menea takes you on a deep dive into the best music from Latinx artists that they love. Hosts Miriam Zoila P\u00e9rez and Ver\u00f3nica Bayetti Flores serve episodes arranged by theme, from se\u00f1ora (old lady) jams, cumbia, reggaeton-ton-ton, 90s chicano power hip hop, lovelorn salsa ballads and cholo jams to songs about mujeriegos (men who cheat). Along the way, they discuss identity, gender, indigenous artists, politics and the cultural importance of musicians who have been/are incarcerated. This is a fun and unapologetically Espanglish lesson in Latinx music and, more importantly, a precious insight into Latinx music culture. Their love of such a huge range of music is infectious. What I love about the series is that Vero and Miriam take it back to a pre-Spotify, pre-algorithm mix-tape era where actual human beings recommend songs they love, arranged by theme. There\u2019s an episode for every mood. Among the highlights is their throwback to \u20181998\u2019 featuring iconic tunes from Elvis Crespo, Shakira, Wassa Banga and Tito Nieves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
