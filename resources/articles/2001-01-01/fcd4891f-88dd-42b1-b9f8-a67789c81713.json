Scotland's City of Discovery hopes to squeeze the 40-year-old Fifa player of the century into a Dundee shirt for a friendly expected to be held at Dens Park next month. Claudio Caniggia, another reformed drug abuser who has resurrected his career at the Scottish Premier League club, was instrumental in luring his former Argentina team-mate from Havana. \"This will give the city the profile we've been striving for,\" said Colin Smith, the chief executive of Dundee's tourist board. \"It's pretty gobsmacking. Dundee is always known as the city with the two football clubs on the same street, but this is incredible.\" \"We reckon this will be a morale-booster for the city,\" said Melvyn Rolfe, councillor for the city's Stobswell area which houses Dundee and Dundee United. \"The eyes of the world will be on us and the attention can only be good.\" The 12,371 crowd set to cram into Dens Park will be a far cry from the 115,000 who witnessed Maradona's finest hour as he held aloft the World Cup trophy at the Azteca stadium, Mexico City, in 1986. His lack of match fitness - he retired in 1998 and is grossly overweight - may prevent him making more than a walk-on appearance. \"But even if he just went on to the pitch and did 10 minutes of keep-me-ups at half-time it would be out of this world,\" said Robin Grimmond, editor of the Dundee webzine Eh Mind O' Gillie. \"Most people would be pinching themselves to see him at Dens Park at all.\" Regardless, Maradona may walk away with as much as \u00a3250,000 from his stroll around Dens Park, which will be televised around the globe. He technically remains a coach at the Argentine first division side San Lorenzo - he has yet to attend a game this season - and is negotiating with Napoli to become their South American consultant. Dundee admitted yesterday that there are still considerable hurdles to overcome. \"We hope to settle details, such as the time of the game, within the next few days but it is increasingly likely any match involving Maradona will take place at Dens Park,\" said a club spokesman. The Dundee manager Ivano Bonetti has also confirmed an interest in signing Lazio's former Italy midfielder Attilio Lombardo. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
