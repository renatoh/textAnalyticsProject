You'll laugh and you'll cry and all your cares will slip away. Corporations should play this to their employees every morning. Time for Heroes is good for getting fired up for meetings - particularly if you're facing individuals of dubious integrity. Philosophy by Ben Folds Five is the first song that got me playing air-piano - it's irresistible. Great for when you're feeling a bit stressed and overwhelmed. For the commute home, Ride On is the song to play. As soon as he's finished singing, AC/DC's Bon Scott will take you out and get you pissed. Sip your drinks though - he died from choking on his own vomit. My girlfriend put Vinny Vinny on my iPod. I think she fancies the singer. They're an unsigned band which I selfishly hope they remain because it means I can indulge the fantasy that my old band Relevant Elephant sounded this good, which they didn't. 1 Flaming Lips - Do You Realize? 2 The Libertines - Time for Heroes 3 Ben Folds Five - Philosophy 4 AC/DC - Ride On 5 Vinny Vinny - Broke Up the Family"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
