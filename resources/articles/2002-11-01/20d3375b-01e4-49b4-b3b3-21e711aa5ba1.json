Shortly after four o'clock, Crozier took a seat in the office of the FA chairman Geoff Thompson and was presented with a straightforward take-it-or-leave-it option: accept the formation of a professional game board and change the way you make decisions, or resign. Thompson was wasting his breath. Crozier had already decided he could not continue as chief executive under this proposed new structure. For all the back-biting and anonymous briefings in the media, ultimately Crozier chose to jump and leave behind an organisation he fears will become a mere salve to the Premier League if the country's leading clubs have their way. Crozier resigned not because of the so-called blazer brigade who refused to accept change, but because he alienated Premier League chairmen who did not like his autocratic style and felt that, while the FA was reaping huge rewards off the back of their players, they were not receiving any financial compensation in return. The writing was on the wall for Crozier four weeks ago when these chairmen met to discuss details of a proposed \u00a35m sponsorship deal that the FA is about to complete for the England team. They were livid that they had not been fully consulted, and that while the FA and their players stood to benefit, the clubs themselves did not. A number of chairmen demanded Crozier's resignation, with some accusing him of being cocky and of using their clubs to fill the FA's coffers. The FA is richer now than ever, thanks to a lucrative \u00a3400m television deal with the BBC and Sky, a huge sponsorship deal and money generated from the England team. Over the past few weeks, some Premier League chairmen have been vociferously briefing journalists against Crozier, accusing him of running a wasteful organisation that spent more on running costs than on investing in football. He was accused of being egotistical and autocratic, and of being in charge of an antiquated organisation not relevant to the modern game. Once the decision was made to go for Crozier's head, Geoff Thompson was the man chosen to do the Premier League's bidding. Thompson, who is seeking re-election as FA chairman next year and has political ambitions within the European governing body Uefa, had the choice of taking on the Premier League and backing Crozier or siding with the country's leading clubs. For those who follow the complex politics of English football, it was clear which position Thompson would adopt. But for Crozier too, the choice was a simple one. He firmly believes that if the new professional game board is formed to run all aspects of professional football, the Premier League will have too much power within the FA while the game's grass roots would suffer through lack of investment. The FA would be a mere a bit-part player, while the serious power lay in the hands of Premier League chairmen who put the interests of their clubs before anything else. But whatever happens next, Crozier will be remembered as one of English football's great modernisers, responsible for changing the image of the FA during his three-year tenure. Under Crozier, the England team became a brand, fans became customers and the FA began to enjoy a new reputation at home and abroad. Crozier, of course, was responsible for securing the services of the Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson as England coach, while a special international relations department was also set up within the FA to oversee football development programmes in many third world countries. The ailing Wembley project finally got underway once Crozier removed Chelsea's chairman Ken Bates and assumed full control, and much of the damage caused by the failed 2006 World Cup bid has also been repaired. Crozier even moved the FA's headquarters from Lancaster Gate to the trendy setting of Soho Square, but while this said much about his vision for the organisation, it also spoke volumes for his management style, which partly cost him his job. The first the FA board knew of the move was when they were told they were all going to new offices. Crozier himself now heads for pastures new - with the future of English football, and who will run it, hanging in the balance.
