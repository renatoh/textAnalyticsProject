These claims are plastered over internet adverts. But do these secret stashes of bargain goods really exist? Is there a sort of parallel eBay known only to a select few? Many of the claims are indeed bunk, but when Guardian Money investigated, the big surprise was that there are bargains to be found if you search hard enough - from stolen bikes starting at \u00a31 where the police can't find the owner to RAF officer shoes at \u00a34 a pair. There's even the 5,000-ton HMS Sir Percivale, which the Royal Navy is currently trying to flog. It can carry 350 troops and their vehicles, and was the first ship to enter Stanley harbour after the Argentinian surrender in the Falklands War. But there's no argy-bargy today. Just press \"add to basket\" and it's yours for \u00a31.5m. First, let's dispel some of the auction myths. The worst are those perpetrated by the fax-back scammers, who flood office fax machines with spurious claims that they will locate \"police and government sales of repossessed retail goods\". Premium-rate phone regulator Icstis this week fined three fax-back operators a total of more than \u00a3100,000 for sending unsolicited faxes promising \"truly amazing no-reserve sales that anyone can attend but few ever hear about.\" Anyone foolish enough to respond is sent a 19-minute long fax charged at premium call rates (up to \u00a31.50/minute) with information the regulator said can be found with a simple search on Google. Icstis investigated the claims of one fax-back merchant, and found that 27 of the websites referred to did not offer any of the items stated on the promotional fax, companies listed were \"trade only\" and only handled bulk orders, while the fax-back itself was unreasonably long with unnecessary spacing and borders to prolong the duration of the premium rate call. So what about the legitimate police and government auctions? They're not secret, and there's no point in paying for a directory or booklet listing the auction houses or websites the government uses. We list most of them here. Bumblebeeauctions.co.uk This website disposes of property that the police have seized or has been handed in, and where the police can't locate the original owner. Stuff on sale reflects criminal tastes; lots of mountain bikes (many \"as new\"), Nike trainers (new, boxed), jewellery and electrical goods such as laptops and iPods. It's run on the lines of eBay, where you bid up to a closing date. There are no minimums, so if no one else bids, the item is yours for \u00a31. PC Tim Wills, who handles disposals on bumblebeeauctions for Sussex Police, says it is not uncommon for bikes to go for under \u00a35. Guardian Money tracked some of the bike auctions last week, and found many sold for \u00a320-\u00a330. The most sought after was a new Giant Yukon bike, which eventually went for \u00a3105. That compares with the \u00a3299 it retails for elsewhere. Other lots listed this week included HP Laserjet printers (several at \u00a320), mobile phones (a Siemens S55 for \u00a31, including charger and manual), Nike Airmax Plus trainers (\u00a35-\u00a310, courtesy of a particularly prolific shoplifter) and assorted packs of batteries, razors and Oral-B toothbrushes from \u00a31 upwards. The drawback? You have to collect larger items from the police force that's offloading them. In the case of the Yukon bike above, that would have required a trip to Chichester police station in Sussex. Only 10 of the UK's 43 police forces are on the site, so large parts of the country are not covered. Smaller items listed on bumblebeeauctions (such as trainers) can be posted to you, but at a fee of around \u00a314. You also have to sign up to the Nochex payment system. PC Wills says: \"It used to be the case that we disposed of everything through local auction houses. But we've found that we can make 10 times as much by doing it online. All the money made goes to charity. It's just beginning to build up momentum at the moment. The Metropolitan Police [not currently disposing on the site] is in the wings as are many other forces. In truth, we've got property stores which are full to overflowing.\" Other police auctions Those forces not using bumblebee dispose of property through traditional auction houses. To find the location of auction houses and the next sale, go to police-information.co.uk, click \"police links\" and then click \"auctions\". For example, you'll see that Merseyside Police disposes of goods through Hartleys in Liverpool, while West Midlands uses Biddle &amp; Webb in Birmingham. Many of the auction houses have online catalogues where you can view lots on sale. Police car disposals If you really want a souped-up Vauxhall Vectra that has probably thrashed a good few times, West Oxfordshire Motor Auctions (woma.co.uk) is the place for you. It holds two auctions a month of \"well-maintained\" used police vehicles, with the next on February 9. Before going in for sale, the police strip the car of specialist police equipment and the yellow markings. The police don't put stolen vehicles through these auctions. Ministry of Defence A specialist wing of the MoD, the Disposal Services Agency, now handles the sale of hundreds of millions of pounds worth of surplus military gear. You can see what's on offer by going to the agency's official website at edisposals.com. It's not just ex-military hardware; listings this week include oak meeting tables, office workstations and long-life batteries. But it's more like wandering round a warehouse in the hope of spotting something you want rather than going on to eBay and expecting to find the item you are seeking. More \"mainstream\" items such as cars and motorbikes tend to be quite fully priced. For example, edisposals.com is advertising a five-year-old Citroen Xsara Picasso with 62,000 miles on the clock at \u00a34,450, which doesn't strike us as much of a bargain. Ships, planes and vehicles Yes, they're all on the edisposals site. But not being regular traders in military hardware here at Guardian Money we can't tell if the price is right for anyone planning a military coup. For example, the \"Cougar Enforcer is a modern, ultra fast, surveillance and interceptor craft,\" purrs the MoD, asking for \u00a3300,000. Budding James Bonds can view it at Rosyth in the Scottish county of Fife - but by appointment only. Army surplus clothing The MOD site pushes buyers through to other online retailers such as the-outdoor.co.uk which sell genuine army surplus clothing. This ranges from assault boots at \u00a319.99 through to full body armour suits for \u00a3200. But for an interesting insight into the underlying price of clothing, go to fieldtextiles.co.uk which bills itself as the \"Textile, Tentage &amp; Camping Equipment Contractor to the MoD\". The website says it is \"strictly trade only\" but in reality anyone can buy - so long as you're willing to place a minimum order of \u00a3250. You'll find leather lace-up RAF shoes in packs of 10 (assorted sizes) for \u00a340 (equal to \u00a34 a pair) and Hi-Tec trainers at \u00a33 a pair. But most people may find the army towels (50p) and blankets (\u00a33) a touch too uncomfortable for modern lifestyles. p.collinson@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
