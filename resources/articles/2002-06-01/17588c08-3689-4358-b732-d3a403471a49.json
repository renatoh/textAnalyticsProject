Do not be surprised to see a few German and Brazilian players mimicking him at lunchtime today and tomorrow. Radio will be the only way to keep up with the World Cup semi-finals after the All England Club, for safety reasons, decided that it would stick to its guns and refuse to show events other than their tournament on the big screen at the Aorangi Picnic Terrace and on other televisions around the site. \u00b7Two hundred ball boys and girls are employed for Wimbledon but their number was reduced by one yesterday when a boy tending Mary Pierce's match against Alicia Molik was hit in the most painful of places by a Pierce piledriver. \u00b7Some tennis parents provide more entertainment than their children so it is a huge disappointment that two of the sport's most colourful characters are absent this year. Jelena Dokic's father Damir, the scourge of the WTA, is looking after his son while mother, with a far less interesting track record, travels with daughter. Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena, is missing having been told by a doctor not to travel due to a weak heart. \u00b7One of the few parents with a more interesting sibling, Goran Ivanisevic's father Srdjan, was here yesterday having been invited as a guest in the Royal Box. Goran, last year's men's champion, was also invited but was advised not to travel as he is recovering from a shoulder operation. \u00b7England fervour continues with flags, hats and shirts in full evidence, but one outfit stood out - full regal robes and an oversized crown. The fan got away with this garb while three Spanish fans had their national flag confiscated for shouting \"Viva Espana\" during Galo Blanco's loss to Belgium's Xavier Malisse. There's home advantage for you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
