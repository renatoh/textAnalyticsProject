The Arsenal Women\u2019s Super League winner said: \u201c180 goals is special, I\u2019d love to be among them one day. I\u2019ve no idea what\u2019s in front of me or where this will end.\u201d For a team that boasts, on paper at least, the best forward line at the World Cup \u2013 the Euro 2017 hero Lieke Martens, Arsenal\u2019s Miedema and Dani\u00eblle van de Donk and Lyon\u2019s Shanice van de Sanden \u2013 the win against a bruising Cameroon, who are ranked 46th in the world, should have been less of a labour. Two goals from Miedema and one from Dominique Bloodworth sandwiched a tidy finish from Cameroon\u2019s best player of the tournament, Gabrielle Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9, to secure the three points and guarantee progress for the Dutch, but the worries that existed before this match remain. Cameroon\u2019s manager, Alain Djeumfa, made three changes to the team that surprised many with a slightly chaotic but exciting performance in their 1-0 loss to Canada in Montpellier. If the bright performance in the south against the team 31 places ahead of them in the Fifa rankings was buoyed by the cheers of what felt like home support, travelling north to the Belgium border would be a very different story. Valenciennnes has a population of around 44,000 but a Saturday 3pm kick-off meant the Dutch were in town and in force, the overwhelming majority of a 22,423 attendance. The Stade du Hainaut is just over 90 minutes\u2019 drive from the Netherlands. A sea of orange that famously flooded towards home grounds of the Netherlands\u2019 Euro 2017 winning campaign, gaining momentum as the team progressed against the odds, continues its legacy. Through the streets of Valenciennes the brightly coloured hordes weaved towards the ground, dancing in unison. The support has continued despite the underwhelming performances of the team since that historic trophy \u2013 they had to qualify via the play-offs and struggled in their opening fixture against New Zealand. Early play here indicated the problems behind their electric front line have not been eliminated. Rather the Dutch seemed to be competing with the players in green for the more chaotic defence. \u201cCameroon are quick and unpredictable and we\u2019re not used to that,\u201d said the Netherlands\u2019 manager, Sarina Wiegman. \u201cThe long ball, we had to get back very quickly. Against Canada I\u2019m expecting a more structured game.\u201d Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 was a constant threat on the right and Desiree van Lunteren struggled repeatedly with the speed of her runs. With five minutes left of the first half the Dutch found an ounce of rhythm. Van de Sanden played a quick one-two with Jackie Groenen and whipped the ball into the middle for Miedema to head home unmarked. The relief felt by the Dutch fans was very short-lived. Just 150 seconds later a pass over the top from the centre circle found Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9, who calmly headed the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper, Sari van Veenendaal, and coolly slotted home to level before the break. After the restart the snappy tackling of Cameroon proved costly. A free-kick by Van de Donk was played short to Groenen. Her cross was poked back into Bloodworth\u2019s path by Cameroon\u2019s Michaela Abam and she fired in from six yards. Cameroon could have levelled but Ajara Nchout shot agonisingly wide. \u201cThe fact we were here in Valenciennes, very close to the Netherlands, we were at a disadvantage,\u201d said Djeumfa. \u201cWe weren\u2019t able to play one hour away from Holland and for it not to affect our team\u2019s psychological level. The referees were not on our side either. I think we did what we could.\u201d The Dutch made the win look more impressive than had been the case when, with five minutes remaining, Miedema got her second, whipping the ball past Annette Ndom from the left. Uncharacteristically she celebrated. \u201cI made a deal with my brother to do a roll on the pitch but that won\u2019t happen again. No more gymnastics, I\u2019ll leave that to Sarina,\u201d she said, laughing. Though the talismanic forward will draw the plaudits, the Dutch will probably be most pleased with the performance of Groenen \u2013 now a Manchester United player \u2013 in the middle. She has seemed off colour of late but was involved in the first two Dutch goals, suggesting the midfield may be finding its feet a little, even if the defence is not. Meanwhile, in Grenoble, Jessie Fleming and Nichelle Prince put Canada into the last 16. Their second-half goals against New Zealand gave them a 2-0 win for six points out of six, while the Ferns\u2019 fate hangs on their game against the Netherlands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
