Influential analyst Neil Blackley, whose warnings on ITV advertising revenues caused Granada's shares to crash last September, said the digital subscription total of 4.08m was slightly below estimates. Merrill Lynch downgraded BSkyB's shares to \"neutral\" from \"accumulate\" and chopped \u00a370m from the group's 2002 pre-tax profit estimate. BSkyB fell 6.56%, or 68p, to 969p on the news. BSkyB revealed a \u00a345m increase in interactive TV costs and a loss of \u00a346m from its stake in KirchPayTV when it announced its first-half results last Wednesday. Despite posting a 50% rise in losses to \u00a3112m, many analysts gave the thumbs-up to the results. West LB Panmure kept its \"buy\" recommendation, saying that the interactive Open and KirchPayTV provided long-term opportunities. Mathew Horsman at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite was also supportive, maintaining his \"buy\" assessment and saying the results were \"bang in line with expectations.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
