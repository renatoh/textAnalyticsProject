On virtually every summer tour since the game went professional they have either been beset by injuries and off\u2011field scandals or too knackered to mount a serious challenge. Suddenly, with Eddie Jones as their master and commander, there is a renewed sense of purpose and homesickness is a thing of the past. Even the news that Joe Marler has received a formal warning from the Rugby Football Union for abusing the former Wallabies coach Bob Dwyer on Twitter felt like a minor blot on an otherwise clear horizon. At 1-0 up in the three-Test series, with no serious injuries and players training as impressively as they have all season before Saturday\u2019s potentially momentous second Test, England could scarcely be in better shape for the biggest game of Jones\u2019s brief tenure. Nothing is guaranteed, clearly, but a clear sense of visiting optimism hangs in the Victoria air. The announcement of England\u2019s lineup did little to dilute it, with only a couple of tweaks to the starting XV from the 39-28 victory in Brisbane last Saturday. George Ford and Jack Nowell will be on the field from the outset, with Luther Burrell and Marland Yarde dropping out of the 23. The youthful trio of Jamie George, Jack Clifford and Elliot Daly have also been named among the replacements, with Jones opting for six forwards on the bench in anticipation of a full-throttle contest. At first glance it is a side set up to start faster, defend better and finish stronger which, sure enough, is Jones\u2019s intention. Nowell and Ford were regular members of England\u2019s Six Nations grand slam-winning side; having not made last week\u2019s run-on team they are now even keener to impress. Nowell had slight knocks to a thumb and his back after the Premiership final but when fully fit, Jones is a big fan of his work rate. \u201cLast week Eddie saying I wasn\u2019t sharp enough definitely gave me a kick up the backside to get my head down a bit more, work harder and try and get the shirt back,\u201d Nowell said. Considering the Exeter wing\u2019s season began more than a year ago with a pre-season camp in Bagshot, it sums up the fresh mindset Jones has sought to instil. The calendar is now secondary to the substantial reward on offer, as the head coach has been telling his players this week. Jones said: \u201cBeing the first side ever to win a series in Australia is a great motivation because if you do that you\u2019re on the walls of Twickenham for ever. That\u2019s what this team wants to be. They have been playing rugby since June but that\u2019s not an excuse not to be at 100%. We have got an opportunity to create history on Saturday and we have left no stone unturned to make sure we do it.\u201d It is Jones\u2019s belief, furthermore, that his side are capable of wrapping up the series with a week to spare. He is not hugely bothered Australia making four changes to their pack, reasoning it will not particularly change how the Wallabies play. \u201cWe are respectful that Australia are a wounded animal and they\u2019re going to come hard at us, but we\u2019ve had a good preparation and we\u2019re in a good spot to play well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has probably been our best week\u2019s preparation: we are physically fit and we are mentally ready to go. I know we\u2019re going to step up \u2013 I know this team is going to get better.\u201d If the ultimate sign of a top team is the quality of the players omitted from the 23, England really are in encouraging nick. Alex Goode, Ben Te\u2019o, Henry Slade, Teimana Harrison, a fit Manu Tuilagi \u2026 with the Saxons prospering in South Africa and the Under-20 team having reached the semi-finals of the junior World Cup, the strength in depth available to Jones is steadily growing. Reuniting Ford and Farrell at 10 and 12 also gives the former Australia coach a couple of maturing on-field lieutenants. \u201cTheir understanding of the game for 23- and 24-year-olds is absolutely outstanding,\u201d Jones added. \u201cThey have got a great command of game sense and game understanding and that is important in big Test matches.\u201d It is no state secret, either, that England are putting particular emphasis on the opening 20 minutes, their least productive period of the game in Brisbane. \u201cWe know we have to get that 20 minutes right, which we didn\u2019t do last week,\u201d Jones said. \u201cDefensive intensity has to be high because Australia are going to be running from everywhere. We\u2019ll defend better than we did last week.\u201d Things could yet become more complicated if the referee, Craig Joubert, takes a less than benign view of England\u2019s scrummaging, but Jones has seen enough of the South African official to be suitably optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019ve played under Joubert against Wales and we thought he was a very good referee,\u201d he said. \u201cI had him in the Rugby World Cup for two of Japan\u2019s games and he was outstanding. For me he\u2019s a really good ref. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not going to be influenced by Phil Kearns or Bob Dwyer or whoever else. We\u2019re confident he\u2019ll do a great job.\u201d Perhaps keen to reinforce that point, Jones phoned up his old mate Dwyer on Thursday, although the pair did not specifically discuss Marler\u2019s latest gaffe, under which the RFU has now officially drawn a line. Jones has also accepted an apology from the former Wallabies prop Stephen Hoiles for his unedifying press conference question last week, but remains rather less forgiving of \u201cfour or five others at Fox Sports who could have apologised\u201d. His only other grievance surrounds Michael Cheika\u2019s view that England were guilty of excessive \u201cniggle\u201d in Brisbane. \u201cWe\u2019ve been respectful about them, the way they play the game and the way they conduct themselves \u2013 and we\u2019ll continue to do that,\u201d Jones said. Should England take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the series, the response from certain Australian quarters will be fascinating indeed.
