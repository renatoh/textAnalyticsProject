The first two presidential elections were formalities. Former leader of the continental army George Washington won twice by unanimous votes in the electoral college. No retired military leader has repeated that feat, but a few have come close. Andrew Jackson won the Battle of New Orleans and two commanding majorities. Civil War leader Ulysses Grant was so good at winning elections that Republicans almost nominated him for a third term as president. Allied supreme commander Dwight Eisenhower won a hard fight for the Republican party's nomination and then made quick work of Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson, who lamely explained to supporters: \"A funny thing happened on the way to the White House.\" Heroic lower ranking officers have done less well. PT boat commander and Navy and Marine Corps medallist John Kennedy narrowly beat supply officer Richard Nixon, who later went on to bury fighter pilot George McGovern in a 49-state rout. Draft dodger Bill Clinton beat distinguished fighter pilot George HW Bush as well as Bronze Star medallist Bob Dole, who had left most of an arm on a northern Italy battlefield. Given this history, John McCain's decision to make his military experience as a fighter pilot, prisoner of war and torture victim the centrepiece of his campaign was a risky one. He did so because it was the only way that he could win the Republican nomination. In his victory speech after the Florida, it wasn't surprising that McCain claimed the mantle of Reaganite conservatism. He'd been trying to placate conservative critics for some time. But how he did it was interesting. He spoke of the \"principles and policies that first attracted me to the Republican party\" that he'd heard \"whispered conversations and tap codes, about the then-governor of California, who stood by me and my comrades\". Grant some creative licence for speechifying, but that was very close to a lie. McCain came from a family of Republicans, and his rightwing voting record is mostly a product of wanting to be re-elected in what used to be a startlingly conservative state. Many issues McCain simply doesn't care to learn much about - including the economy, as he said on the stump recently - so he goes along with the opinions of those who send him to Congress. Where McCain has bothered to assert himself, he's tended to rub libertarians and conservatives the wrong way. He voted against the Bush tax cuts, forced through a free speech-threatening campaign-finance law, championed government solutions to curb climate change, pushed for comprehensive immigration reform and campaigned against torture by US government interrogators. McCain responded to most criticisms by invoking his own experience (it's hard to argue with \"I know about torture\"); by acting like his honour was offended when seriously challenged; and by jaw-jawing an awful lot about America's wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and other countries yet to come. He pitched himself as the only candidate with the experience and the resolve to see this bloody business through to the end. He bet that the Republican party was no longer merely a hawkish party but a warlike one - that Republicans would be willing to put aside their differences on supposedly petty issues to support more war making. After some struggle, it worked. In his speech at CPAC Thursday, Mitt Romney announced that he was throwing in the towel rather than challenge McCain further because he didn't want to risk dividing the country in time of war. McCain then won cheers from a sceptical crowd by preaching resolve against America's enemies. But the country is already divided. The US has Iraq withdrawal advocates and stay-the coursers; Iran doves and Iran crooners (recall that McCain sang \"bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran\"); 9/11 denialists and those who think that the attack justified almost any future American action. McCain's admirable past will likely win him his party's nomination, but if it does, the old bomber will now face the fight of his life.
