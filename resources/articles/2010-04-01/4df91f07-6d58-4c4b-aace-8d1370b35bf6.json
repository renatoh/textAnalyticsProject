In 1996 a New Zealand scientist reported that in the wild the resourceful bird made two distinct kinds of tool, one a hooked twig, the other a barbed leaf, to lever tasty grubs from woody concealment. Early humans, he observed at the time, did not start using hooks until after the lower palaeolithic. In 2002 a New Caledonian crow astonished Oxford observers by seizing a piece of wire and swiftly bending it into a hook to yank a tasty titbit from a glass cylinder. It looked like avian cogitation, but humans who use the word \"birdbrain\" as an insult needed a little more persuasion. A study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society today seems to settle the matter. Experimenters in the western Pacific caught wild crows and tested their ingenuity on their home ground. The captive crows were set a three-stage problem. They had to get a short stick by pulling up a string, use the short stick to get a long stick out of a toolbox, and then use the long stick to fish the sumptuous snack out of a hole. They did it. So a random flight of corvids \u2013 at liberty once more \u2013 grasped the notion of a \"meta-tool\", applied an abstract idea and matched complex cognition and behavioural innovation. The American preacher Henry Ward Beecher said that if men \"bore black feathers, few would be clever enough to be crows\". Certainly, in a parliament of fowls, they would rule any roost."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
