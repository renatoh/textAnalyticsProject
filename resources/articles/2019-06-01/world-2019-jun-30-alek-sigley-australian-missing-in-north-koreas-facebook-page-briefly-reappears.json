Morrison told reporters at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, on Saturday evening that he had been in contact with Sigley\u2019s family. He said world leaders at the summit had offered their assistance in attempts to locate the young man. \u201cI will just be measured in what I say because that is all about using the best opportunities we have right now to, to inform ourselves about where Alek is and what his safety is and where he is being held, in what conditions,\u201d he told reporters on Saturday evening. Sigley, one of only a handful of western students in the secretive country, last made contact with his Australian family on Tuesday. His Facebook page, which had been taken down to prevent unnecessary speculation online, briefly reappeared on Saturday. Sigley\u2019s Twitter account has remained online and members of the public have posted messages of support there. The 29-year-old Australian moved to North Korea to study for a master\u2019s degree in Korean literature at Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang, and also ran a small tour company specialising in educational trips to North Korea. He posted regularly, on a private blog and on social media accounts, about food, fashion and every day life in the secretive state. Guardian Australia published a first-person account by Sigley in March. Experts have suggested Sigley might have been silenced in the lead-up to US president Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the demilitarised zone (DMZ). When asked if Trump\u2019s visit to the Korean DMZ presented an opportunity for the Americans to make representations, Morrison said he would not allow the issue to be taken up with other agendas. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with everybody to secure Alek\u2019s safety and the best way we can do that is doing it quietly, effectively, working with our partners \u2026 not allowing this to be taken up into other agendas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s simply, for me, about Alek\u2019s safety. Sorry.\u201d The treatment of foreign citizens by the secretive North has long been a contentious issue. American student Otto Warmbier died in 2017 after being detained in North Korea for stealing a propaganda poster from his hotel room."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
