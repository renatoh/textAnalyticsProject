The prize - a book of stamps, a cardigan and some crayons - went to an election-day letter in the Times, complaining about the government's destruction of the British constitution and the behaviour of a \"supine House of Commons\". Its author was someone who believes in a golden age that never existed - and who fails to recognise what is going on in front of his eyes. During the last parliament, between 2001 and 2005, the Labour whips had to deal with backbench MPs who were prepared to rebel more frequently than those in any postwar parliament. All those ludicrous poodle references from the immediate post-1997 period are now so deeply ingrained that people frequently struggle to believe this when they are told. The government's relatively easy victory in the Commons over ID cards on Tuesday night should not fool anyone. If you were looking for an issue to act as a first test of the how the government will cope with its much-reduced majority, it would be hard to find a worse test case than ID cards. Of the 21 issues to cause backbench rebellions during the 2001-2005 parliament, 18 resulted in larger rebellions than did ID cards. This time round, unlike then, it's also an explicit manifesto commitment. So ministers and whips shouldn't assume that a comfortable majority over ID cards means a comfortable majority over everything else. And those who enjoy carping about the uselessness of Labour MPs should wait awhile. The figures are clear. Labour MPs rebelled in 21% of divisions during the last parliament, a higher figure than in any other parliament since 1945. The rebellions in 2003 over the introduction of foundation hospitals broke the record for the largest health-policy rebellion ever by Labour MPs against their own government. The 72 Labour MPs who voted against the second reading of the top-up fees bill in 2004 were precisely double the number that had until 2001 made up the largest education rebellion ever by Labour MPs. And the rebellions over Iraq were the largest by MPs of any governing party, Labour, Conservative or Liberal, for more than 150 years. To find a larger backbench revolt than Iraq, you have to go back to the Corn Laws in 1846, when the franchise was enjoyed by just 5% of the population, and before anything which even vaguely resembled today's political parties had been formed. Since the beginnings of modern British politics, in other words, there has been nothing to match the Iraq revolts. What more do you want? Since election night the line from Labour party HQ has been that the government's new smaller majority will \"concentrate the minds\" of Labour's MPs. The bloated majorities enjoyed since 1997 had allowed Labour MPs to rebel without giving much thought to the consequences. With a smaller majority, so the argument goes, they will have to exercise more self-discipline. Possibly. A handful of Labour MPs have already made it clear to their whips that this time they intend to behave differently. But it's worth remembering the last time a government was re-elected with a much smaller majority. In the days after the 1992 election, most commentators declared that John Major's 21-seat majority was perfectly workable. But they had reckoned without the extent to which the habit of revolt had been widespread within the Conservative party during the Thatcher years, when (just like between 1997 and 2005) MPs had been able to rebel relatively freely, given the size of the majority. Ask John Major whether he feels that having such a small majority concentrated the minds of Bill Cash, Teddy Taylor, Teresa Gorman et al. Or look at how the Labour government of 1974-79 managed with a small or sometimes nonexistent majority. Self-immolation rather than self-control were the order of the day. Or take someone like Jeremy Corbyn, who has voted against his party more than 200 times since Tony Blair became prime minister. Does anyone think that after the 2005 election he decided that it was now time for him to toe the party line? Ditto for Bob Marshall-Andrews (whose mind appears to have been concentrated almost entirely on the removal of Blair ever since he arrived in the Commons), or for MPs such as John McDonnell, Lynne Jones, Bob Wareing, Alan Simpson, Kelvin Hopkins, Dennis Skinner, Glenda Jackson, Mark Fisher, Neil Gerrard, Mike Wood, Peter Kilfoyle or David Taylor. And that's before you think about Clare Short, Gwyneth Dunwoody or the other Labour MPs with what police officers call \"form\". For the whips the arithmetic is simple and depressing. The government's effective majority is 71. To defeat the government it takes only 36 Labour MPs to vote with the opposition. Among Blair's MPs there are 60 who rebelled on 10 or more occasions in the last parliament. Still there, for example, are 56 of those who voted against the government's last anti-terrorism bill, introduced just before the 2005 election - easily enough to defeat the government should it mishandle similar legislation now. An article in the latest issue of the Canadian Journal of Political Science provides a solution for Labour. It's a comparison of the behaviour of Canadian Liberal MPs and their British Labour counterparts. Why are the former so loyal, but the latter so rebellious? The answer lies in their feelings of involvement with the way policy is decided. Canadian Liberal MPs are almost three times as likely to say that they feel involved in policy-making. So even when they disagree with the final decision they don't rebel. British Labour MPs, on the other hand, feel almost entirely shut out and so they take their frustration out in the division lobbies. Writing a book on the behaviour of Labour MPs, I got used to the reaction. Sit down with most backbench Labour MPs and before you have time to put the sugar in your coffee they have gone off on one about the extent to which the government did not consult them in the making of policy. Top-up fees and foundation hospitals would have been difficult enough to get through the PLP at the best of times. What made them infinitely worse was the way they appeared without any consultation. Extensive concessions after a bill is published are no substitute for involving backbenchers in the initial formulation of policy. \u00b7 Philip Cowley is the author of The Rebels: How Blair Mislaid His Majority, to be published next week by Politico's p.cowley@lse.ac.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
