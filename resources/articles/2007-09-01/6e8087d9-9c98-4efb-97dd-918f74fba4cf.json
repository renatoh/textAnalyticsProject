Huddlestone, returning from suspension, volleyed home for the opener after 25 minutes and Noble, showing composure in the slippery conditions, scored the second seven minutes later. Aston Villa's Gabriel Agbonlahor should have added a third after the interval when James Milner played him through but Nikolay Mihaylov, the Liverpool goalkeeper on loan at FC Twente, saved well. Matt Derbyshire went close with a clever chip and had an effort blocked in the six-yard box. The only blot on the evening came when Noble picked up his second booking in as many games for a foul to rule him out of the next qualifier against Montenegro at Leicester City's Walkers Stadium on October 12."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
