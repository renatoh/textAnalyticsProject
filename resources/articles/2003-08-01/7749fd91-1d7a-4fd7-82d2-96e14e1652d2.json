Tuesday: BBC reporter Andrew Gilligan defends his story but internal email from his Today programme manager Kevin Marsh says 'strong investigative journalism' was 'marred by flawed reporting'. Wednesday: Tape recording of Dr Kelly by Newsnight's Susan Watts contradicts the evidence that the scientist gave to MPs. But Watts also attacks BBC bosses for 'pressurising' her, revealing a split over BBC tactics. Thursday: Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon overruled the advice of his Ministry of Defence civil servants to insist that Kelly gave evidence in public. Friday: Inquiry rest day. Witnesses for second week named. \u00b7 The decoder What are they talking about? A proper security-style interview - Chilling phrase used by John Scarlett, head of the Joint Intelligence Committee, about the rigorous questioning Kelly should face so 'that all these inconsistencies are thrashed out'. Defensive strategy - a media plan put in place to give as little away as possible. The MoD used it twice while trying to dea with the Kelly issue. Briefing Up - Civil Service speak for telling your boss what is going on, in the hope that they may make the key decision rather than leave it to you. Box 850 - Insiders' code used in a letter by Kelly to refer to M16 - Britain's intelligence agency dealing with international issues. \u00b7 Document trail 254 documents - letters, emails, transcripts and memos - referred to in evidence can be seen at www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk. These include five drafts of the 45-minute claim and top civil servant Kevin Tebbit's letter to Geoff Hoon advising against Kelly being 'thrust into the public eye'. A key memo, yet to be released but referred to on Thursday by deputy intelligence chief Martin Howard, records Blair's views that 'it would be sensible to go into a bit more detail into the differences' between Kelly and Gilligan - the first to directly link the PM to the handling of Kelly. \u00b7 Counting the cost \u00a34.15 Expenses claim - for an Appeltise and a Coke - made by reporter Andrew Gilligan following his meeting with Kelly at the Charing Cross hotel. \u00a362,469 Kelly's salary. The scientist complained that he was underpaid. His complex role made it difficult for him to find out who he should ask for a raise. 'The poor guy hasn't had a pay-rise for three years,' wrote an MoD civil servant. \u00b7 The public interest The Hutton inquiry is now on the tourist trail, with American visitors among those in the public gallery. With just 40 places available and 'people turned away in droves', a new annex will create extra viewing capacity for both the public and the international media this week. London's Tricycle Theatre will stage a dramatisation of the inquiry in October. \u00b7 WMD chic? WMD has become the one piece of militaryspeak that everybody now knows. Brooklyn Beckham, aged four, was pictured wearing a 'Weapon of Mass Destruction' T-shirt while out shopping in Madrid on Thursday. \u00b7 The week ahead After a tough week for the BBC, the spotlight is firmly on the Government this week. Most attention will focus on Alastair Campbell's evidence on Tuesday. But just as important will be Downing Street chief of staff Jonathan Powell's evidence tomorrow. He will be quizzed on how far Number 10 was involved in the strategy to deal with Kelly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
