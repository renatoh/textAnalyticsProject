The singer and guitarist, who fronted 80s rock art combo Orange Juice before enjoying solo success with the hit A Girl Like You, was taken ill on Sunday. A statement from his management team said: \"Edwyn Collins suffered a cerebral haemorrhage on Sunday night and has been in hospital since, where doctors are trying to stabilise his condition. As soon as we will have more information we will let you know.\" Collins, 45, who lives in London, was working as producer on the debut album from London blues-soul three-piece Little Barrie when he was taken ill. The artist was born in Edinburgh in 1959. In 1976, he formed the Nu-Sonics, which resurfaced three years later as Orange Juice. The band led the Glasgow neo-pop scene with songs like Rip It Up and earned a devoted cult following but little commercial success. Despite his trademark soulful baritone, the singer later struggled to launch a solo career and was signed briefly with Alan McGee's Elevation in 1986. After becoming a producer in the 1990s, Collins earned another shot as a performer when he signed with the small UK independent label Setanta. He then recorded his third solo effort, the album Gorgeous George, and its song, A Girl Like You, became a huge international hit in 1995."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
