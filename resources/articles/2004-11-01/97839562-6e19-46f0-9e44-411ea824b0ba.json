Bushkin was the son of a music-loving barber from Ukraine - who practised his cello between customers and had a two-chair shop in the tough district around 103rd Street and a subsidiary business in illicit alcohol and slot machines. Bushkin started piano aged 10, found he had perfect pitch but, having damaged his hands in an accident, learned the trumpet. Soon back on the piano, he was playing club dates in his early teens with Benny Goodman's brother. It took a chance encounter with a black band led by Elmer Snowden to turn him on to jazz and a succession of dance jobs followed, including gigs in a Hoboken, New Jersey, whorehouse, where he earned $40 a night for trumpet accompaniments to the jukebox. By 1935 Bushkin was playing intermissions at the Famous Door on New York's West 52nd Street opposite the combo led by trumpeter Bunny Berigan, before moving on to clarinetist Joe Marsala's racially mixed band at the Hickory House. He recorded with singer Billie Holiday and with Marsala's outfit, but was not enamoured of harpist Adele Girard's performances - she was Marsala's wife - and quit to join the alcoholic Berigan's big band. Pay was intermittent and, after Berigan went bankrupt, Bushkin joined cornetist Francis \"Muggsy\" Spanier's Ragtimers. It was Bushkin's piano introduction and solo on Spanier's Relaxin' At The Touro that helped make it a classic record. When that band folded, Bushkin moved back to Marsala's 52nd Street group before a two-year stint in Tommy Dorsey's big band. He wrote a number of good songs for Dorsey, including Oh Look At Me Now, the first hit for the band's singer - Frank Sinatra. It was during this time that Bushkin also cemented his relationship with Bing Crosby, with whom he toured in later years, including a couple of visits to Britain in the 1970s. Bushkin recorded with Dorsey for Crosby in 1940 on the Road To Morocco soundtrack and several commercial sessions. Wartime United States army air corps service turned him back into a trumpeter; he also recorded with Lester Young on piano and directed music for Moss Hart's morale-booster Winged Victory on Broadway for six months before serving in the South Pacific. Back in New York, he became a studio pianist before taking a short-lived job with Benny Goodman. \"We didn't see eye to eye,\" he said. Thereafter, Bushkin freelanced, acting a jazzman's part in Garson Kanin's stage play The Rat Race, worked briefly with Louis Armstrong and led quartets in New York supper clubs. It was a lengthy engagement at the Embers that made him something of a star, leading the likes of trumpeter Buck Clayton and drummer Jo Jones and recording a string of successful albums. During his early Embers period Bushkin married his wife Fran, who was from a wealthy Dutch-English family. After living in London and Hawaii, the couple settled on a Santa Barbara, California, ranch to breed thoroughbred horses. Semi-retired, Bushkin could pick and choose work, turning out to accompany Crosby and taking occasional club jobs in New York, and making odd European festival and US appearances. He lost none of his sparkle as a player even into his 80s. Bushkin clearly revelled in the chance to perform when I saw him in Florida in 2001 (with his trumpet-playing son-in-law Bob Merrill), and impressed everyone. He is survived by his wife and their four daughters. \u00b7 Joseph Bushkin, pianist and trumpeter, born November 7 1916; died November 3 2004"}, "isHosted": false}}}
