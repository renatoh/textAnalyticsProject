Mart\u00ednez told a press conference on Friday the Tottenham defender was likely to be absent from his squad not only for the forthcoming international fixtures but for the next round of them, too \u2013 which would have him out until 20 November. Vertonghen injured his hamstring after 15 minutes of Spurs\u2019s win at Huddersfield last Saturday when he stretched and received a kick at the same time. He thought that it was merely a dead leg and played on until half-time only to feel the pain when he entered the dressing room and the adrenaline subsided. He did not reappear for the second half. Pochettino described it as \u201cnot a good injury\u201d but he suggested that Mart\u00ednez might not have all of the facts and, as such, ought not to have put a timeframe on the player\u2019s absence. Vertonghen has had the injury scanned but he will have a second one on Monday, which should provide a more accurate picture of how long he will be unavailable. \u201cWe\u2019re so disappointed but we\u2019ll see if it\u2019s six weeks or less,\u201d the Tottenham manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to communicate with all the national teams. Before my press conference, you knew about the Vertonghen situation because Roberto told the media in Belgium before us. In the end, it\u2019s our player, our Tottenham player, \u2026 our Tottenham employee. They need to call us. If they call us, we are more than open to talk and give our opinion.\u201d Vertonghen played the 90 minutes in six of Belgium\u2019s seven World Cup matches in Russia \u2013 he sat out the third group game against England \u2013 while he played the 90 minutes for Tottenham in their opening seven matches of the season before being rested in the Carabao Cup against Watford on the Wednesday before last. Pochettino\u2019s assistant, Jesus Perez, explained that Vertonghen had been placed on a specialist programme in the week leading up to Huddersfield, with \u201cno competition during the week.\u201d Pochettino said that Vertonghen\u2019s injury had nothing to do with tiredness, rather the impact of the challenge, but he remains concerned about the demands being placed on players by a \u201cdangerous\u201d schedule. Tottenham, for example, must play four games in nine days from Monday 29 October, when they entertain Manchester City at Wembley. That game has been set back because of an NFL fixture at Wembley and the delay in the rebuild of White Hart Lane. \u201cThe plan was to be in the new stadium but it\u2019s not ready and we have to accept it and not complain because we create the problem,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cBut the football business today does not care about the player \u2013 it\u2019s about games, games, games. Another problem comes after because you need to build a bigger squad [as insurance] but not all can play and then people are not happy. It doesn\u2019t help the dynamic of the group.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
