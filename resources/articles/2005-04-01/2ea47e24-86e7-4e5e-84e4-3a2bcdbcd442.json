Concentrating on the events immediately before and after daughter Sarah's horrific death, and its subsequent repercussions for the family, A Mother's Story makes a bleak and convincing read. Payne is remarkably perceptive and refreshingly candid in her descriptions of meeting both politicians and senior News International executives during her time campaigning for 'Sarah's law', and gives a remarkable insight into the complications and potential heartache that are consequences of co-operation with the tabloids. Indeed, she is uncomfortably honest about the effects that the situation has had on her husband, Mike. While it is impossible not to admire Payne's spirit, it is hard to shake off the feeling that she has benefited more from the writing of this book that anyone ever could from reading it. Which Side are you on? Ken Loach and his Films Anthony Hayward Bloomsbury \u00a38.99, pp230 Anthony Hayward has had impressive access to Ken Loach, his archives and his former colleagues for this thorough yet accessible biography of the man and his films. More importantly, his tone is an appropriately measured one, which seems to paint a rounder picture of a director whom people tend either to eulogise or dismiss as self-indulgent. Covering his childhood and education, as well as his time at university performing with Dudley Moore, this well-researched portrait also brings to life his early battles at the BBC, his censorship during the early 1980s and his return to cinematic favour in the 1990s. While the photographs used are generally of rather poor quality, the depth of the interviews creates an intimate biography, giving insight into what can make Loach so treasured for his passion and innovation by so many, yet so reviled by others for his perceived propaganda or excessive loyalty to realism. Where we have Hope: A Memoir of Zimbabwe Andrew Meldrum John Murray \u00a37.99, pp272 Andrew Meldrum moved to Zimbabwe in 1980 as a rookie journalist with dreams of watching democracy grow in southern Africa; he left in 2003, illegally expelled by police. His story is very much that of Zimbabwe. He recreates his enthusiasm and youth as well as the infectious excitement of Mugabe's new nation with heartbreaking vibrancy, and his distress at the subsequent devastation of the country is tangible. It is this personal aspect that makes Where We Have Hope so readable. Its strength is Meldrum's portraits of the various characters to have peopled his time in Zimbabwe, and his parallel recollections of his emotional and professional journeys there. His personable, matter-of-fact tone serves less to dismiss the extraordinary injustices the coun try and its people have suffered and more to highlight them by giving them context. But, most significantly, he still finds pockets of hope in this otherwise tragic narrative."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
