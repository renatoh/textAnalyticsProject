Their manager Lawrie Sanchez left the ground in disgust afterwards leaving his assistant Terry Gibson to explain: \"Sometimes you can say things in the heat of the moment that you regret so he decided to go home.\" A hat-trick by Mark Robins put Rotherham three points clear at the top after a 4-3 home win against lowly Swindon, who led twice before Robins wrapped it up six minutes from time. In the First Division, Huddersfield's manager Lou Macari praised his \u00a3200,000 signing Andy Booth after he scored the opener in a 4-1 home win over Portsmouth. \"Booth caused them lots of problems in the air and was a real threat,\" he said. The Terriers are two points behind Grimsby, who are above the drop zone but lost 2-1 at Norwich. Lennie Lawrence, Grimsby's manager, conceded: \"It will take a massive effort, both physically and mentally, to get out of trouble now, starting next week when we play Tranmere.\" The Third Division leaders Chesterfield made it three games without a win after being held 1-1 by Southend. David Reeves earned a point with a second-half equaliser. Brighton are eight points behind after a 2-0 win over Mansfield."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
