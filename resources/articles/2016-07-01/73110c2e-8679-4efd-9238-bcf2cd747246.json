It\u2019s an affront to women\u201d, Comment). This is the thin end of the wedge and must be vigorously opposed by all who believe that our modern democratic society should be free of misogyny, homophobia and subcultural exclusivism. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, demonstrated the same woolly liberal acceptance of sharia as part of our multiculturalism. We need to be rigorously secular in our civic realm for the common good of all. Unfortunately, the broader context is not helpful. This is exemplified by the existence of unelected clergy in the House of Lords and state faith schools (we know how divisive the latter are in Northern Ireland); soon to be supplemented by dozens of new Church of England free schools. Philip Wood Kidlington Oxon I note that the man proposing polygamy does not mention polyandry. I can see some advantages in the latter \u2013 perhaps one husband to earn money, another to cook, another for childcare etc\u2026 and possibly some interesting variations in bed? The woman concerned would not feel the need for a lover! Pat Parkin-Moore Leicester House prices fall? Marvellous Shirley Williams (\u201cBring all sides together to negotiate our future with Europe\u201d, Comment, ) lists three negative consequences of Brexit, or \u201cproblems\u201d, one of which is that \u201cthe London property market, no longer attractive to ambitious young bankers and financial experts, declines\u2026\u201d. Exactly what sort of problem is this to ambitious young doctors, teachers or managers outside the financial sector who might now actually be able to afford somewhere to live? John Old Nuneaton Warks Evolution just keeps evolving Nicholas Hales\u2019s letter about species going extinct is headlined: \u201cThe danger of losing our close connection to evolution\u201d. His concern would be justified if indeed we are losing between 1% and 2.2% of species every decade. But this is an extrapolation from an estimate based on a guess. As someone who has spent a career trying to drive nasty microbes to extinction, and researching antibiotic resistance, I respect the power of evolution. It is a mighty force. I don\u2019t think that we are going to lose our connection with it just yet. Hugh Pennington Aberdeen So very glad to be Scottish Presumably, in your plea: \u201cAndy, please cheer us up\u201d, the \u201cus\u201d refers to the English (News). Andy Murray is a native of a well-governed, stable nation, blessed with outstandingly able political leaders and a people who, unlike the benighted English, have not brought down upon themselves a self-inflicted catastrophe. Merrick Jones Manchester A new economic model I agree with Andrew Rawnsley that the country needs an \u201cinternationalist, broadly centrist, liberal, reformist political party\u201d. (\u201cThe Iraq disaster helps explain why Britain is in this dark place\u201d, Comment.) What we need first, however, is an economic model that offers a viable place for the left-behind of our society. The political failure even to talk about developing an inclusive economy has encouraged the emergence of \u201clet\u2019s throw the toys out of the pram\u201d political movements. Martin London Henllan Denbighshire Why so sniffy about science? Your summer books recommendations (New Review) once again reveals your extreme bias against science and scientists (one only \u2013 Stephen Pinker). Why can\u2019t we have reading recommendation from such as Richard Dawkins, Paul Nurse, Steve Jones, Brian Cox, Monica Grady, Jim Al-Khalili or many others, even your own Robin McKie, John Naughton and occasional columnists such as Alice Roberts, Adam Rutherford and James Wong? Why are you so biased against anyone who is not an author or literary critic? Eric Gendle Nunthorpe North Yorks Nasty then, nasty now Your editorial says: \u201cIt is a sure sign that a Leadsom premiership risks returning the Conservatives to their status as the \u2018nasty party\u2019.\u201d (\u201cLeadsom is no leader, not least over Europe\u201d, Comment.) Have I missed something? When did they ever lose it? David Fyfe Arbroath Angus"}, "isHosted": false}}}
