Instead of promoting more black and Asian top staff, Whitehall has seen the numbers entering these posts dropping alarmingly over the past six months, The Observer has learnt. Almost two thirds of the 34 government departments reported fewer than five senior staff from non-white backgrounds, although staff levels for ethnic minorities frequently rose above 10 per cent, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) has found. Several major departments, including the Treasury, Constitutional Affairs, Culture, Environment and Transport reported no senior managers at all from the ethnic communities, as did the Cabinet Office itself, which is responsible for diversity in the government. At Defence, Education and Trade, the proportion of black and Asian senior managers has dropped over the past six months, while at John Prescott's Office of the Deputy Prime Minister the figure fell from seven to four per cent. The 'snowy peaks' survey uses the Cabinet Office's own figures to provide an index of progress in appointing black and Asian people to senior posts. This has revealed that only the Department for International Development appointed a proportion of senior ethnic minority staff (11 per cent) that came close to matching the numbers of junior staff from similar backgrounds (13 per cent). Worst of all were the security and intelligence services which reported less than two per cent of employees from the ethnic minorities and no senior managers. Trevor Phillips, the CRE chairman, said the research showed that, although ethnic minorities were accepted in most workplaces, major stumbling blocks still remained for their access to top jobs. 'This is more than a glass ceiling. There is a point at which everybody is comfortable with ethnic minorities in the workplace. But when it comes to being put on the senior team, that's when they fall off the horse.' One surprising positive note came from the Prison Service, which has often been described as 'institutionally racist'. It is one of only two bodies where there are a higher proportion of ethnic minority managers (14 per cent) than frontline staff (six per cent). Phillips congratulated the Prison Service and its director, Phil Wheatley, for the strides made in countering the popular perception of prison officers as white-only. 'Where there has been progress, it is no coincidence. We have worked closely with the Prison Service to improve its record. But others have taken their foot off the pedal. When departments bleat about qualified people from ethnic minorities not applying for jobs, this tends to mask an inertia in their recruitment policy.' The CRE has warned that the failure to achieve genuine representation undermined the legitimacy of the departments and government bodies involved. It has written to officials at the Cabinet Office, urging it to take further steps to increase diversity. The Cabinet Office said it accepted its role in promoting diversity across Whitehall: 'We recognise that the Civil Service needs a workforce that reflects the society it serves. 'Increasing diversity is a key element of the Government's civil service reforms. Equality of opportunity for all is one of the foundations on which the Civil Service is based.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
