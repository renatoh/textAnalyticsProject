The England winger is not blazing; that is simply not his style. The teacups at the Under-21 squad's hotel on the Swedish coast remain in one piece. But Walcott is quietly smouldering at the manager, Stuart Pearce, and what he perceives to have been a personal affront. Consider the situation through Walcott's eyes. At the end of the Premier League season he is called up to play for both Fabio Capello's senior England team in two World Cup qualifiers and Pearce's Under-21s here at the European Championship. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Walcott's manager at Arsenal, argues passionately that it has to be one team or the other. He is fearful of burn-out for the 20-year-old but Walcott makes a stand and says that, when his country comes calling, at any and every level, he jumps. Perhaps Walcott was mindful of having missed the last Under-21 Championship in 2007 through injury. To Wenger's irritation Walcott plays for England against Kazakhstan and Andorra and then flies to Sweden to join up with the Under-21s. Pearce, backed by Capello, has won the battle. Wenger rages. Then comes the twist. Walcott performs poorly in the opening match against Finland and Pearce, whose team is reduced to 10 men by Michael Mancienne's 31st-minute sending-off, substitutes Walcott at half-time. He drops him for the next game against Spain. Having gone against Wenger's wishes and metaphorically moved mountains to support Pearce, Walcott felt entitled to a little bit in return after one substandard half of football. \"That was one of the messages I did get across [to Pearce],\" he said. \"I just wanted to be shown a little bit of support for being here.\" In Walcott's mild-mannered world these are outspoken words. \"I'm obviously disappointed at coming off [against Finland],\" he continued. \"You never like to be substituted. Even my parents booed me off at half-time. But it's a squad game and it wasn't going for me that day and I wanted to show what I could do coming off the bench against Spain. \"Of course I was angry and I took it out on the pitch against Spain and let my feet do the talking. You probably saw me around and about the place and I wasn't too happy, obviously, because I came here to play. If you are not disappointed, there is something wrong.\" Pearce's treatment of Walcott has been bold, to say the least. He has repeatedly promoted a collective ethic, in which all 23 squad members are equally judged, and he has certainly reinforced the message over Walcott. Pearce did not warn him in advance that he would not start against Spain; Walcott found out on the morning of the game when Pearce pinned up the teamsheet. At that moment Walcott's emotions may have included embarrassment. But nobody can argue with the results that Pearce has got. He switched to two strikers after half-time against Finland and watched his team come through to win 2\u20131 whereas against Spain, Walcott's impact as a 62nd-minute substitute helped to fashion the 2\u20130 victory that rendered the final group game against Germany stress-free. Pearce rested all of his regulars \u2013 Walcott was happier to be on the bench this time \u2013 and the second string drew 1\u20131 to set up a semi-final with Sweden in Gothenburg tomorrow. \"It was the manager's decision [against Spain] and it worked out to be the right one,\" said Walcott, who is determined not to rock the boat. \"I'm disappointed not starting games but obviously that [performance] showed I can achieve great things in this team. Am I still angry? You've got to be angry coming on the pitch. You don't want to be too angry and get sent off but, hopefully, I'll be at it against Sweden.\" It would be understandable if Walcott did not want to continue for Pearce's Under-21s after this championship, given his status as full international, but he claimed that was not the case. \"For me I'm not a full England player yet,\" he said. \"I still have to work hard to play well for Arsenal and, if you're not playing well, you're not going to be in Mr Capello's team.\" Walcott describes Pearce as \"a very focused manager\" who \"just wants to win\". It has been hard to second-guess Pearce thus far and Walcott remains on edge, the emotions churning. All eyes will be on the teamsheet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
