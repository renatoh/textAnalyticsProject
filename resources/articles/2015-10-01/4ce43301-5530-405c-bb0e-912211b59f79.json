Wales have called him up as a replacement for Liam Williams, who injured his foot playing Australia last Saturday. First time around, before the World Cup began, Walker was as an emergency replacement for Leigh Halfpenny but he had to drop out of the squad when he damaged his hamstring in training. The fact Walker is back now shows how stretched the Welsh are, since he has not recovered from the injury and the assistant coach, Rob Howley, said Walker is not fit enough to be considered for selection for Saturday\u2019s quarter-final against South Africa. Wales, it seems, have simply run out of bodies for their back line. Walker is there to provide cover for the semi-final if they make it through. Howley confirmed that George North and Alex Cuthbert will start on the wings, North switching back from outside-centre, where he played against Australia. \u201cBoth George and Alex will likely be on the wings,\u201d Howley said. \u201cIf you look at South African strengths and the way they play the game, it\u2019s an aerial battle and we\u2019ve decided that George and Alex will be the best wings to negate that threat. \u201cWhen you look at the experience in their back line, with Bryan Habana and JP Pietersen, who is back from injury, it\u2019s a case of trying to match that experience and strength with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d Habana and Pietersen are in-form players with nine tries between them in the tournament. Wales\u2019 dilemma is in midfield, where they will have to decide who will play at outside centre. It appears increasingly likely the job will go to Tyler Morgan, who turned 20 last month, a few days after he made his Test debut in Wales\u2019 warm-up match against Ireland. Morgan then played in the pool match against Fiji after being called into the squad as a replacement for Cory Allen. He actually had what Howley described as a \u201cslight injury\u201d himself last week. \u201cWe have not been afraid to use young players,\u201d Howley said. \u201cTyler played really at 13 against Fiji, who are very physical, something we will have to defend against and attack against at the weekend. Tyler came through that game really well and, if it wasn\u2019t for his injury, might have started against Australia.\u201d The alternative would be to pick James Hook, who last played in the centre in 2012. \u201cWe have said about James over the last couple of years that we want to see him as a No10,\u201d Howley said. \u201cWhat has happened over the last five weeks has changed that. James has been making sure that he has been doing his homework for 12 and 13.\u201d As for whether Walker will still be needed next week, Howley sounded pretty bullish about Wales\u2019 chances of making the semi-finals, in spite of it all. \u201cWarren Gatland always had a saying at London Wasps when I was playing under him, that we are \u2018battle-hardened\u2019. We\u2019ve come through the last few weeks after really tough games against tier one nations and Fiji cannot be under-estimated. They were extremely physical and tough. That gives us a really good platform. We\u2019ve been playing at an intensity week in, week out that will prepare us no end for what will come on Saturday because, as we know, they are a top side in world rugby.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
