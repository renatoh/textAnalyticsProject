The middle-aged wreck living in 1985. The sweetly inept 17-year-old living in 1955. And the sporty, novelist superdad living in a new version of 1985, a beneficiary of his son's history-changing adventures in the space-time continuum. The real Crispin Glover, now 47, is nothing like any of them. He looks younger than even the freshest-faced incarnation: skin smooth and honeyed, sipping an almond milk cocktail in one of London's few raw-food vegan restaurants (\"I plan to live into my hundreds\"). He's wearing a black velvet blazer and silk tie. He's courteous, earnest and organised. In repose, his expression tends towards the frightening. When he smiles, he looks as cute and gummy as a newborn. He's been touring the globe for the last six years with a show that involves a screening of one of his feature-length art films, plus projections of his collages, a Q&amp;A session and a book signing. He's often still going at 4am. \"If I were to leave before I'd answered all the questions, they might get mad on the internet. And being personable is good business.\" For such a notorious eccentric, he's quite the pragmatist. The movie shown on the UK leg is It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine (2007), his second work as a director and, says Glover, \"the best film I'll have anything to do with in my whole career\". No tapes are available \u2013 the only way to see it is to go \u2013 but it appears to be a psychosexual fantasia written in the style of a 70s TV movie by Steven C Stewart, who also stars \u2013 and who had cerebral palsy and died soon after the shoot ended, aged 63. There is, says Glover, enormous emotional catharsis in the film. But it's also a mission statement, showing that disability is no handicap to dark intentions \u2013 territory Glover first explored in the self-scripted What Is It? (2005), mixing dissected snails, actors with Down's syndrome, a man in blackface, himself as a \"Duelling Demi-God Auteur\" and Stewart being copiously masturbated by a woman in a monkey mask. \"It's my reaction to the constraints that have happened in corporately funded film in the last 30 years,\" he says. Born in Los Angeles to two actors, Glover decided at 13 to get into acting professionally. When he was 16, in 1980 \u2013 Glover is remarkably precise on dates \u2013 he began steeping himself in films from the 60s. As an actor, he juggled outre loss-leaders such as The Orkly Kid with crowd-pleasing breadwinners until the success of Back to the Future enabled him to devote himself to the experimental. \"I felt an obligation to find films that genuinely reflected my psychological interests.\" But, the Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper road movie River's Edge aside, \"it didn't really happen. And being in films that don't make money isn't that good for your acting career.\" What changed was two big paydays \u2013 one from the Back to the Future producers, who recycled his image without his consent when he declined to return for the sequels, another from a cameo in the Charlie's Angels movies. Those performances bankrolled the set for It Is Fine!, just as his role in last year's Hot Tub Time Machine presumably aided the purchase of a 16th-century Czech chateau, in which Glover plans to shoot his next film. What is it like to owe your career to the mainstream, yet spend the profits paddling against the tide as hard as possible? \"It's very difficult. But Kubrick managed to ask questions within the studio system.\" The raw lasagne wings its way to our table. \"Vaudeville distribution allows me to recoup my costs yet I would prefer being corporately presented.\" He smiles, the strangest salesman, flogging snail entrails and disabled homicide to those who may remember him best as the kooky kid in that Michael J Fox film. \"But I think it may take time before my interests correlate with theirs.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
