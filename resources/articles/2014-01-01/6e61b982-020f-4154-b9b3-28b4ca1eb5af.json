The inquiry found he may have caused \"distress\" to women by violating their personal space, but decided his behaviour did not merit disciplinary charges. Rennard, it must be said, strongly denied impropriety throughout. Police interest was also curtailed due to insufficient evidence. But what catches the eye is the public advocacy there has been on his behalf from Lord Carlile, the Lib Dem peer and QC. On Thursday, raising the issue that neither he or Rennard had seen the internal inquiry report, he accused the Lib Dems of a \"terrible example of secret justice\". This Lord Carlile who, as the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism processes between 2001 and 2011, defended the use of control orders and the use of secret justice through the special immigration appeals commission. Responding in 2012 to government proposals for secret courts under the justice act, he wrote: \"My conclusion is that a system can be devised in which there is justice and accountability, without there necessarily being total transparency: by its nature secret material is opaque not transparent, and that opacity necessarily has to be protected.\" Might the party quote his words back at him. \u2022 Revenge of sorts for the French media after its drubbing in the British press for failing to subject President Hollande to a Paxman-esque inquisition over his alleged clandestine relationship with the actress Julie Gayet. Off went a French TV crew to the Midlands and that current crucible of Britain's social conscience, James Turner Street, AKA the Birmingham setting for Channel 4's welfare expos\u00e9 Benefits Street. The French crew filed numerous reports, each incredulous that such scenes could be played out in the land of \"fair play\" and Wellingtonian self-reliance. The French TV stations are also enjoying themselves. Last night on Channel 18 \u2013 Julie Gayet in the film A Family Fallen Apart. \u2022 Each day, a new controversy over the hugely successful C4 series and James Turner Street. James Turner? Who was he? The city council doesn't know. The best guess is that he was a local gunmaker of note, or a minister. Indeed this is a tale of extremes. \u2022 Some time since we heard from Dr Alan Sked and his New Deal party, the fledgling leftwing alternative to Ukip. But the idea may well have its time, as left-of-centre critics of the EU get organised. There is precedent. Back in the 1970s, Labour heavyweight Peter Shore, later Lord Shore of Stepney, railed against increasing federalism. The Brent North Labour MP, Barry Gardiner, would never cast himself successor in that lonely fight, but he has been forced to explain why he circulated to local voters a calendar displaying his works and achievements illustrated in the Ukip colours of purple and yellow instead of the more obvious red. Just a coincidence, he tells the Wembley Observer. \"I tend to do it in different colours every year. The point is, it is there to look nice. The content is what is important.\" And Ukip's no threat to me, adds Gardiner, batting away Tory jibes. The fear of Farage hasn't yet enveloped Brent. \u2022 Congrats, finally, to John Humphrys, still the grand inquisitor of our day. At the age of 70, he tells a Media Society event, he has been taken off the freelance roster and has become a BBC staff member. And hasn't he earned a bit of job security over the years, for eviscerating the powerful, but not least for avoiding internal bloodshed? The former Today editor Phil Harding told an earlier Media Society gathering that Humphrys once saved him from an editorial pummelling. The legendary Brian Redhead, he said, furious at not being sent to a European summit, called the editor a \"fucking incompetent fool\" and, as if to emphasise the point, took a lunge at him. It was left to Humphrys \u2013 risking collateral damage or worse \u2013 to throw himself between them. Then, as now, willing to interject. Always good in a crisis.
