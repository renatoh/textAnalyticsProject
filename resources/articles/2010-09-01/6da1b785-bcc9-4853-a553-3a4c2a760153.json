From the bushes opposite comes answer, then from close by another adds to the clashing chorus, so that it is no longer possible to separate the chiff from the chaff. Two birds flit in quick succession across the wide dividing path. Though their voices speak of summer, the chiffchaffs are streaming south now. Wild service trees overhang the ride here, their maple-like leaves a riot of zigzag indentation, berries ripened to the colour and grainy texture of miniature Egremont Russets. I break one open and it has the lightly perfumed smell and fleshy look of an apple too, but when I drop a piece on my tongue it sucks all the moisture from my mouth. A jay flies high over the ride. It has the swooping, broad-winged glide of its tropical forest ancestors, but its heart is set on English oak. It clatters through the outer foliage of the tallest tree in a pick-your-own orgy, each violent shaking of a leafy branch signifying another acorn plucked. At ground level, a hunting party of hornets patrols the scabious flowers. The insects power from plant to plant, each landing causing the bobble-headed flower to sag to the ground then catapult back when its burden lifts off. One plant that displays seasonal brilliance has threaded its way up through the blackthorn on facing sides of the ride. The berries strung out along the stems of the north-facing bryony are largely green, the unfinished products of a sun-starved end to summer. But on the south-facing bank, red counterparts sparkle as if freshly dipped in clear varnish, the sun-kissed fruits of autumn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
