With just over eight months to go until the London Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency said the BOA was no longer compliant with its code following a meeting of its foundation board in Montreal on Sunday. \"I'm very disappointed that it's come to this,\" the Wada president, John Fahey, said after the decision was announced. Having taken expert legal advice, Wada believes the consequences of a ruling last month by CAS that will allow the US 400m Olympic champion, LaShawn Merritt, to compete in London makes the BOA's lifetime ban untenable and no longer compliant with its code. The BOA, however, plans to defend its policy arguing that it is an eligibility criteria rather than an additional sanction. In a statement the BOA said it welcomed Wada's decision because it would bring \"clarity and closure\" to the dispute. \"On behalf of the overwhelming majority of British athletes we will vigorously defend any challenge to the selection policy which bans drug cheats from representing Team GB and we will publish the process we intend to follow in the near future,\" it added. The BOA stopped short of saying it would appeal to CAS but it is expected to do so once it has received Wada's written findings. The International Olympic Committee will have to decide what sanctions, if any, to take against the BOA. In theory it could exclude the British team from its home Olympics if it refused to amend its rules to comply, although in practice such a drastic step is highly unlikely. Although the BOA chairman, Lord Moynihan, has said the BOA has \"every chance\" of defending its rule in court, most other experts expect it to fail. That would leave banned British athletes including the sprinter Dwain Chambers, the cyclist David Millar and the shot\u2011putter Carl Myerscough free to compete in the London Games. The IOC, which was forced to drop its own \"rule 45\" that suspended athletes with a ban of more than six months from the Games that followed in the wake of the Merritt case, has publicly backed the BOA's stance. But it will not want to see a high-profile and increasingly personal row between the host Olympic association and Wada deepen. It also accepts that CAS's opinion is final. Moynihan and the Wada director general, David Howman, have exchanged increasingly public barbs over recent days. Moynihan delivered a hard-hitting speech in which he lambasted Wada's \"toothless\" rules, said they were dragging the fight against doping back to the \"dark ages\" and needed a \"full review\". The BOA then made public a letter from Wada, which included a legal opinion to say that it should have the lifetime ban rule reviewed in the wake of the Merritt decision. The BOA believes that by taking the decision to find it non-compliant to an appeal, Wada will effectively be forced to go to CAS in Lausanne to argue the point. Wada had previously said that it would not go to CAS over the interpretation of the rule but was merely pointing out it believed it made the BOA non-compliant and urging it to review it. Moynihan is also likely to argue that by going to CAS, which is likely to hear the appeal within the next two to three months, it will allow the point to be settled well ahead of the Games and without the involvement of individual athletes. Wada was set up in 1999 as an attempt to establish a universal global approach to the doping problem that was threatening to destroy the Olympic movement. It is effectively a 50-50 joint venture between national governments and sporting bodies. In a lengthy rebuttal to Moynihan's speech on its website and a series of interviews, Wada has pointed out that the BOA signed up to the creation of the agency and its approach and conveyed its fury with the public nature of its challenge. \"It was a very emotional tirade of criticism without substance,\" Howman said on Friday. \"We were disappointed because it came out of the blue. We had been trying to behave very professionally by entering into correspondence rather than some sort of debate in the public eye.\" Fahey said on Sunday after the board meeting: \"We had their decision conveyed to us through a vitriolic spray in a speech that was circulated to everyone except us earlier this week.\" The BOA's rule, introduced in 1992 and applying to any athlete banned for six months or more for drug offences, is now the only lifetime ban in world sport. The BOA claims it has the support of more than 90% of British athletes for the rule."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
