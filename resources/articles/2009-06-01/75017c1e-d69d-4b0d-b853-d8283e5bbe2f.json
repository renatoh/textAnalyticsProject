I have been in contact with BT about this disputed debt but received no response. Last September I changed my landline and broadband supplier to BT and was told I had to pay \u00a329.99 for a new line because my previous supplier, Tiscali, had bought my line outright. I was given a new number. Some days before the engineer's visit, I called Tiscali to check that it had been notified of the change by BT. It had not and said there was no need to pay for a new line since it was happy to release mine. At this stage, my faith in BT was diminished so I decided to remain with Tiscali and cancelled the order. However continued problems with my broadband connection prompted me to reconsider. I then received a deluge of correspondence and bills from BT for several accounts. I got nowhere with BT staff so spoke to Tiscali again. Tiscali said BT had broken the terms of the contract by not providing the adequate service I had requested. I put this to BT which agreed and said it would cancel my contract, waiving the usual cancellation fee. I returned to Tiscali but continued to receive bills from BT. RP, London BT has listened to the recording of the call where you were clearly told that all cancellation charges would be removed from your account and no charges would apply. But the adviser who told you this did not put any notes about it on your account so, when all the other advisers you spoke to looked at your file, they believed you should be charged. Faced with the proof that you were promised a free transfer, BT has now honoured the agreement. It has contacted Moorcroft to get your account returned to BT where it is being written off. This relates to your broadband account but BT has also removed all charges on your telephone account and sent a cheque for \u00a3138. \u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU and include a telephone number.
