No one knows how the alligator, which has been nicknamed Carlito and Harbour Park Harry, entered Machado lake, which is near a busy road and surrounded by oil refineries and offices in Harbor City. Jane Kolb, spokeswoman for the city's department of recreation, said: \"We're assuming that somebody had a pet that got too big and they dumped it.\" Alligator wrangler Jay Young, who charges $800 (\u00a3650) a day for his services, headed back to his native Colorado on Thursday after several unsuccessful attempts to catch the alligator, which was discovered on August 12. Los Angeles officials who contracted Mr Young said they were giving the animal a breather in the hope that it would be easier to catch if relaxed. They said Mr Young would take at least a week off before he resumed stalking the reptile. \"We're going to get him back to kind of relaxing and laying on the lily pads, and so we're doing therapy for the gator,\" Ron Berkowitz, recreation and parks superintendent, told KABC-TV. As crowds continued to build, rangers were patrolling the area 24 hours a day. Visitors have lobbed a variety of treats at the gator, including tortillas, jam doughnuts, and dangled raw chicken into the water as bait, but all to no avail. Vendors are selling alligator logo T-shirts. \"That gator is now everybody's pet in Los Angeles,\" said Jason Anderson, among those waiting for a sighting. Mr Young offered to forgo payment if he could not catch the alligator, but parks general manager, Kirk Mukri, said the city still planned to pay up. On Wednesday, the animal avoided capture by chewing up a modified fishing net. Once the alligator is captured, it will be held for 90 days at Los Angeles zoo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
