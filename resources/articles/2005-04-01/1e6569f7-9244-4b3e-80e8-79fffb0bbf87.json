Margaret Hodge, the Children's Minister, suspended adoptions in June last year over concerns that documents were being forged and mothers coerced into giving up their children. Six couples will argue in the High Court of Justice that Hodge did not have the power to impose the ban and abused her position by failing to consult them. The couples say her decision takes no account of Cambodia's humanitarian crisis, in which Unicef estimates there are over 670,000 orphans from a population of just 13 million. 'We have all been approved to adopt Cambodian children,' said Malcolm Dixon, one of the campaigners fighting the ban. 'It's bizarre.'
