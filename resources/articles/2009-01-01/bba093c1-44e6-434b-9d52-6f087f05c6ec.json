Had he been told when stepping into the dug-out as manager for the first time at Bournemouth that a quarter of a century later he would be taking teams to Wigan and losing, Redknapp might have wondered how far his career would actually have progressed. He has achieved plenty since 1983 but so have Wigan, whose sixth win in seven Premier League matches pushed them to where Tottenham would like to be \u2013 on the fringes of qualifying for European football. Redknapp, meanwhile, finds himself back in a relegation battle with Spurs and admitted last night that too many members of his squad lack the fight needed to pull out of the bottom three. \"It looks like we have a certain type of player right through,\" Redknapp said. \"The bench have plenty of flair but we are in a relegation scrap and we need men, we need characters to get out of it. We have some but not enough and that is the problem. You would put your life on Ledley King, you would put your life on Jonathan Woodgate or Michael Dawson . . . we have some.\" And then his voice, like his team's performance, trailed off. What also gnawed at the Tottenham manager was his side's loss of concentration in the final minutes. It cost his side points at West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle United and did so again here. The corner from Ryan Taylor that delivered Wigan's last-gasp goal was routine but Dawson had been taken off with a concussion and in his place was Jermaine Jenas, a midfielder with a midfielder's instincts. A natural centre-half like Dawson would have sensed the danger from Maynor Figueroa sooner but, once the Honduran's head connected with the ball, his first goal for Wigan was unstoppable. \"I told him it was just like Jackie Charlton,\" Figueroa's manager, Steve Bruce, grinned. \"You know the way he used to lose his marker when he came up for a corner. He just looked at me \u2013 he hadn't a clue who Jackie Charlton was.\" Redknapp was not inclined to smile. While the astonishing turnaround against Burnley in the first leg of the Carling Cup semi-final meant Tottenham have one foot \u2013 and both arms \u2013 in Wembley, this was their fifth league game without a victory. The dramatic momentum that accompanied his arrival appears, temporarily at least, to have drained away. \"Of course I am concerned,\" Redknapp said. \"You look at Tottenham's results in the last year and you would be concerned. When I came here they had two points from eight games. Scary, isn't it? Look at their results after the Carling Cup final and see how many points they got.\" He added that it was up to the players to dig Spurs out of a mess of their own creation. \"After all, it was them who got us in it,\" he said, and although it seems unfathomable that a side able to name Jenas, David Bentley, Tom Huddlestone and Darren Bent on the bench could be relegation candidates, this performance supported Redknapp's complaint that Tottenham lack a balance between flair and fight. Jermain Defoe's debut after his \u00a315m return from Portsmouth was different from all his others in that it not only failed to produce a goal, it was also completely innocuous. He would have woken in the Hilton hotel, that great, grey tower on the Manchester skyline, and prayed for success, as he prays every morning. He left Tottenham last January because he felt he did not play enough and because his England prospects were suffering. Here he went straight into the starting line-up and was watched by the England manager, Fabio Capello. But Defoe received no freedom to roam and was smothered, figuratively and sometimes literally, by Wilson Palacios. Capello might have been more interested in Emile Heskey, who celebrated his 31st birthday with Bruce suggesting that he could see out the final six months of his contract at Wigan rather than leave in the transfer window. If so, that would give the manager's latest signing, the Colombia striker Hugo Rodallega, more time to bed in. The club hopes to receive the 23-year-old's work permit today. The longer the match wore on the more ineffectual Tottenham became. It seemed strange that Redknapp did not bring off his goalkeeper, Heurelho Gomes, who appeared to be suffering from a hamstring injury. Judging from his facial reactions, Gomes does not hide pain well, although Redknapp commented that he \"had my own reasons\" for not removing him. This could either mean that Gomes was laying his pain on with a trowel or that Redknapp considers C\u00e9sar S\u00e1nchez, the reserve goalkeeper he inherited, to be unsatisfactory. The Tottenham midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who made his sole league appearance this season in Spurs' 1-0 defeat to Everton, has joined Borussia Dortmund on loan until the end of the season.
