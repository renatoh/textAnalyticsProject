I'm on my third, itself a replacement of the infamous fourth generation 40GB Click Wheel, who's battery expired on its 11th month. Two days after reading your article, my replacement expired - it had just turned seven months' old. I don't know why there aren't hoards of people chucking defunct iPods through the windows of Apple's flagship London store. Problem is, the company seems impenetrable. I hope you continue to hold it accountable. Jenna Featherstone, London Playback time...one look that costs \u00a3175 \"Is your iPod one of the bad Apples?\" you ask. Yes, and I believe there is \"a widespread reliability problem\". I have an iPod 20GB Click Wheel and it \"froze\" permanently one month after the warranty expired. I know of five people who have had similar problems. I took it back to the shop and was told to contact Apple online. It told me it was out of warranty and would cost \u00a3175 just to have a look and I should consider buying a new one as \"it is only a computer\" L King, Liverpool Why I've decided to play to a different tune I bought two 40GB Click Wheel iPods about two years ago for my partner and myself. Both failed after about 18 months, leaving us with \u00a3600 worth of junk. There was no support online, and it took two visits to Apple to have one diagnosed as having a failed hard drive. I was not offered a repair or replacement as it was out of warranty (I was told how to open the iPod case if I wanted to carry out my own repairs - something that, as you might expect, has not yet yielded much success). I had been a huge Apple fan, recommending them and using iTunes daily. Now I am looking for more reliable alternatives. Rob Davis, London You have to be a genius to get an appointment At last, someone has spoken up for us unfortunates who bought problem iPods - thank you. I'm now on my third in 2.5 years! My first started to play up just inside the warranty, freezing, wiping the hard drive etc. The geniuses at the \"Genius Bar\" at Apple's Regent Street store in London made it all better and sent me on my way - three times. The iPod then limped to the end of its year warranty but gave up the ghost on it's one year and one month birthday. When I took it back to the geniuses, I was told, unfortunately, I was the unlucky owner of a \"bad unit\". Naively, I bought another...and exactly the same has happened! This time I have managed to get a replacement. I do enjoy my iPod; I work in the music industry and I rely on it. But the lifespan is not acceptable. Another thing that annoys me. It's so hard to get an appointment with the Genius Bar...perhaps because so many iPods are buggered!! Bev Burton, London And finally, a few words of praise I, too, am on my third iPod. The first broke down after eight months (it started to skip every other song until it skipped through all 1,589 of them). This was replaced with a new one. No real problem, except I was annoyed because I had assumed it was more robust. Then six months later, the next one broke in an identical fashion. This time, of course, I was out of warranty so I complained. I was somewhat shocked - but pleased - when Jessica Eltzel, executive relations at Apple, phoned to discuss the problems. I described them to her and she asked me what I did with the machine. I pointed out that most of the time it was in my suit jacket. I certainly didn't dance about with it as the adverts seemed to suggest most people do! I pointed out that while I was aware the warranty was for only one year I would have expected a brand new replacement to at least make it past that point and not break with the exact same fault. She was sympathetic and organised, very quickly, a replacement at no cost. Jon Hunter via email \u00b7 Write to Money, 119 Farringdon Road, London, EC1R 3ER.
