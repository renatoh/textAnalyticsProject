It is a glorious month, greener than any other, with potential still in the air and the Chelsea Flower Show to look forward to. Frost Although there may well be frost until the end of May in some areas of northern Britain, the majority of us can be pretty sure we have had our last by the middle of the month. Once the all-clear sounds, the first job is to harden off the half-hardy annuals. If you have a cold frame, it is wise to acclimatise all those plants that hail from warmer climes before putting them out in the open. Transplant shock can slow down a plant considerably. For years I gardened without a cold frame, and instead kept my seedlings up by the house, under fleece, until they were toughened up. Pelargoniums Tough as old boots they may be, but last year's pelargoniums appreciate repotting and new soil to set them up for the summer. For best results, pick off dead foliage, prune back to healthy new shoots and give them all the sun they can get. I am busily building up a collection of scented-leaved pelargoniums, and order them from Woottens of Wenhasten (woottensplants.co.uk). Tomatoes Tomatoes originate from South America and suffer as soon as temperatures drop below 10C. Keep them under cover until you can be sure that the weather is warm enough to plant them outside, and then find the warmest spot to give them all the help they can get. If you are growing in the ground, keep well away from the potatoes, as blight can travel from one to the next. I also try to keep the plants in a position that is warm but with air movement, as the blight favours humidity. Bush varieties are great in pots on the terrace. Potatoes Earth up the potatoes until the canopy of foliage is closed over. The tubers start to swell as the plants come to flower, but don't be tempted to harvest until the flower trusses are fully out. Potatoes are easy to please, but they need water at this point to produce a good crop. If a dry period coincides with flowering, it is worth drenching. Nothing tastes better than the first bowl of earlies with the simple addition of butter and sea salt. Beans Pinch out the tops of the broad beans once the flowers are visible, as it helps to keep the black fly at bay. Keep the tops, as they are delicious steamed and dressed with a little olive oil and lemon. Wait until the end of the month to put in the French beans, and hold back until early June for the runners, as they need the heat to do well and will rot in ground that lies wet and cold. It is good to learn that most fast-growing annuals catch up if you get the timing right. Put your efforts into successional sowing of lettuce and salad leaves. Radish make great fillers between rows of slower-to-develop veggies. Bulbs Don't be tempted to mow off bulbs in grass until five to six weeks after the last flower. They need this time to replenish their energy and the wildlife will enjoy the long grass, so leave it to do its thing for a while yet, if you can. Iron rations If your acid-favouring plants are looking pale and in need of a tonic, drench with chelated (sequestered) iron. Cut Perennials The \"Chelsea Chop\" in the week of the flower show (or thereabouts) helps to keep the taller, late-flowering perennials from leaning. Pinch out asters, helenium and eupatorium at knee height and they will re-branch to provide you with stockier plants."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
