Now scientists say they have unpicked why fallen foliage makes rails so slippery. When leaves are crushed against the tracks, they form a black layer that drastically reduces friction between train wheels and the rails \u2013 a situation Network Rail has described as \u201cthe black ice of the railway\u201d. But the make up of this slippery layer has been something of a puzzle. Now researchers say they have revealed a key ingredient: large molecules found in plants called tannins. \u201cThey are the chemicals that make wine dry, and they are present in tea,\u201d said Dr Michael Watson of the University of Sheffield, a co-author of the new research. The team say the study suggests leaf tannins grab onto iron that has been dissolved from the rails by acids in the foliage, forming a layer of black material that reduces friction between steel surfaces. This substance, added Watson, is very similar to the iron gall ink \u2013 a substance used for centuries for everything from sacred texts to drawings by Leonardo da Vinci. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Watson and colleagues report how they made their findings by infusing water with sycamore leaves to produce an acidic brown extract. When a drop of iron chloride in water \u2013 representing iron dissolved from the rails \u2013 was added to this leaf extract, a black iron-containing material formed. This was not the case when a tannin-free leaf extract was used. The researchers then placed their tannin-containing leaf extract between pairs of steel surfaces, finding the black material that formed significantly reduced the friction between them \u2013 compared with situations where only water or tannin-free leaf extract were applied. \u201cThe leaf extract by itself can cause this extremely low friction,\u201d said Watson. The team did not compare their black material to material recovered from rail tracks, and cannot rule out other factors contributing to the slippery conditions. However Watson said the findings open up fresh possibilities for reducing the impact of fallen foliage. \u201cHopefully this will lead to some chemical treatments that can stop [the slippery material] from forming,\u201d he told the Guardian. Watson added the next step is to investigate the tannin content of leaves from different types of tree, adding that could help inform Network Rail\u2019s tree-felling operations. \u201c[We want to explore] which ones are going to have the biggest impact if they are felled, and then retain the rest of them so that we are not losing that habitat,\u201d he said. Zili Li, professor of rail systems and monitoring at Delft University of Technology who was not involved in the study welcomed the research. \u201cThis is an interesting finding and it is worth further investigation in laboratory and railway environments that are closer to real life slippery rail phenomenon,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
