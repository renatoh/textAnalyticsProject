It ensured Terry Yorath's reign as full-time Wednesday manager began with his team scrambling out of the bottom three and also saw Wanderers moving up into second place in the division. Nevertheless the inescapable conclusion from this dour affair was that the Owls have more desire to remain in the First Division nest than Wolves do of fleeing it. And it was a conclusion not lost on the Wolves manager David Jones. \"I've had a few words to say to my players,\" he said after another off-colour home display resulted in his side's failure to regain pole position. \"It's disappointing you don't play without fear when you've got a home fixture and can go back to the top. \"Only four or five of the players were on their game so we did not play as a team. \"I'm not in the excuses game and it was a poor performance.\" He did put forward the absence of striker Nathan Blake and loss of Mark Kennedy with the recurrence of a hamstring injury as mitigating factors. But he was also indebted to the displays of his centre-backs Joleon Lescott and Paul Butler for Wolves' scrambling draw that leaves them two points behind the leaders Burnley but with as many games in hand. A First Division table with Burnley and Wolves vying for its summit has the look of the early 1960s about it, but it was the display of a player who would not have looked out of place in an even earlier era that eclipsed those of the two home defenders. Wednesday's Owen Morrison not only boasts the skills of an old-fashioned winger, he sports the knee-length shorts to match. He is also very quick, which almost proved Lescott's undoing midway through the second half. The defender appeared to bring Morrison down in the penalty area but the referee Scott Mathieson remained unimpressed by Wednesday's pleas for a penalty or the winger's reaction, booking him for dissent. However, the lack of a penalty award would have proved academic had the otherwise impressive Gerald Sibon been on target with two second-half headers, the chances supplied courtesy of Morrison crosses. At least they were close enough to warrant the concern of the Wolves goalkeeper Michael Oakes; by contrast, Kevin Pressman did not have a shot on his goal to save as Wolves huffed and puffed to little effect. In fact, Wednesday, realising they had little to beat, looked the likelier winners once they showed more ambition in the second half, but Yorath was happy with his side's point. \"It was a good team performance and it's probably fair to say we had the better of things as the game went on,\" he said. \"Our away form is picking up and if we can make Hillsborough more of a fortress then I'm sure we'll be all right.\" Man of the match : Owen Morrison (Sheffield Wednesday)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
