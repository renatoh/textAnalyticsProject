Let us Europeans hope that next week the second part comes true, too. Woods played some near-perfect golf yesterday in the American Express World Championship event here in County Kilkenny, to equal his own course record of 65 and finish 14 under par and two ahead of Jerry Kelly. He is three ahead of Steve Lowery and David Toms, the US PGA champion, and seven ahead of the nearest European Ryder Cup player, Niclas Fasth. In 36 holes, Woods has had not a single bogey. There are some good names lurking around the lead: Retief Goosen is 10 under; Ernie Els nine under and David Duval and Davis Love III both eight under. But they are going to have to find another gear, while Woods would have to slip one, if there is to be anything other than a procession over the weekend. Historically Woods does not relinquish a lead, and neither does he an opinion. Having said on Thursday that he finds all but the playing part of the Ryder Cup a pain, he reiterated it again yesterday. He dislikes intensely the four days before the matches start simply because someone else is in control of his life. \"You have to practice when someone else tells you to, eat when the schedule says eat,\" he said yesterday. \"I would love it if we could just turn up on Friday and play.\" Asked if he disliked the pre-match proceedings so much that he might one day refuse an invitation to play, he side-stepped repeated questions from a would-be Paxman as adroitly as Gerald Davies used to do for Wales and the British Lions. He said: \"If I could just show up on Friday ...\" But given that you can't? \"Exactly, you can't. That's what makes it not as much fun preparing for it, because you can't.\" But is there one day when because of all that you might just say: \"I don't want to play in the Ryder Cup this year?\" Woods said: \"Let me ask you a question. Would you rip [me apart]?\" The answer was \"yes\" and there was laughter all round. But he still had not answered the question. Woods has found support from many of his team-mates for his opinion that winning this week is preferable to winning next. Tom Lehman, a former Ryder Cup player, said: \"When people talk about what kind of player someone was, they count his majors not his Ryder Cup points.\" Phil Mickelson said: \"We play golf as individuals our entire lives and I understand what he's saying. It's not so much the million dollars, it's winning that individual championship.\" Mark Calcavecchia, who is 12 behind Woods, grimaced and said: \"I'm right there with him - but I'm not going to win this week so next week is more important right now.\" His captain, Curtis Strange, brushed off the whole question by saying: \"I know Tiger, and whenever he plays he plays to win, so it doesn't affect me one way or the other.\" There are only 11 players out of 64 here who are over par, a low-scoring extravaganza that owes much to the amazing condition of the greens. \"They are absolutely perfect,\" said Woods. \"We don't play on greens like this very often.\" Considering he was last out, when spike marks often spoil even good greens, this was quite a tribute and Woods went on to say: \"Even if the wind blew the guys are still going to shoot low numbers because the greens are that good.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
