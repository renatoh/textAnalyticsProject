Watched by no more than a couple of hundred spectators at the home of non-league Solihull Moors, the 28-year-old made his first appearance since his challenge on Eduardo da Silva 25 days ago left the Arsenal striker with a fractured fibula and dislocated ankle. With his three-match suspension coming to an end 24 hours earlier, Taylor took his place in Birmingham's reserve side against Tottenham Hotspur's second XI at Damson Park. He could not have hoped for a more low-key fixture in which to make his return, the lack of a competitive edge allowing the former Blackburn player to stroll through the match. A far-post header helped to set up Birmingham's first goal in a 3-3 draw but otherwise the central defender was inconspicuous. Alex McLeish had been keen for Taylor to get back playing again at the earliest opportunity, with his outing here, in front of the Birmingham manager, increasing the likelihood that he will be named in the squad for the crucial relegation battle at Reading on Saturday. He will certainly not be able to get away with dangling a leg out so tentatively at the Madejski Stadium, as he did last night when Tottenham's Adel Taarabt evaded him to set up the visitors' second goal. There was at least some reassuring news for Taylor earlier in the day, when the Football Association confirmed that it had rejected Fifa's calls to impose a longer ban on him. At the request of the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, the chairman of the world governing body's disciplinary committee, Marcel Mathier, studied the disciplinary file relating to the Eduardo incident and requested that the FA review the case and reconsider the standard three-match suspension. \"It would be unreasonable at this stage of the season to change our disciplinary procedures purely on the basis of one case,\" said an FA spokesman, who added that the FA will review \"dangerous tackles\" at the end of the season. \"That would be a dangerous precedent to set,\" the spokesman said. \"Serious foul play carries a three-match ban and the only cases where that has been increased is where there has been a clear case of intent and no one is suggesting that happened in this case.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
