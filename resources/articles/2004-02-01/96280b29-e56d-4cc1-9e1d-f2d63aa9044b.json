The Scottish Football League said it had no objection to the gesture as long as players were registered with the club at the time of the Hampden Park final with Rangers or Hibernian on March 14. An SFL spokesman said: \"Ultimately, if they are still registered players, that is all that matters to us. \"What they are paid is a matter for them and the club and, if they came to a private agreement about turning out for nothing, it is a club agreement. \"If the players made no complaint about not being paid, it is a matter for them. So it could very easily happen that they could play for nothing.\" But the administrators, Kroll's Corporate Advisory and Restructuring Group, could not offer the players any assessment of their chances of playing in the final. A spokesman said: \"We have not been here that long and from the point of view of actually doing the evaluation of the business and the situation and reviewing options we wouldn't have got to that level of understanding. That may not be clear until day five.\" Buoyed by reaching the first final in Livingston's history, the captain Stuart Lovell insisted his team-mates, many of whom could be made redundant by the administrators on Monday, would play without pay on March 14. Lovell believes the players, who earned Livingston their historic date by beating Dundee 1-0 with Derek Lilley's last-minute penalty at Easter Road on Tuesday night, would want their day of glory, whether or not they were on the club's payroll. He said: \"I don't imagine they would be given the opportunity to play for nothing in the final, but I know to a man that any one of the players would do it. We talked about that before the game. It's very hard to ignore what's happened in the last couple of days but this is a great opportunity for a lot of players. \"It would be horrible to lose any of these guys, not just those playing from the start but also the substitutes and the guys in the stand because we are a very close-knit club. This is a real tragedy for the people of Livingston because the club seemed to be on the up and up.\" Livingston's next big date is their Tennent's Scottish Cup fourth-round meeting with Spartans on Sunday and the outgoing chairman Dominic Keane has asked the administrators for redundancies to be left until after the tie. Martin O'Neill will speak to a number of Celtic's most influential players in the next fortnight about the possibility of signing contract extensions. The English pair of Chris Sutton and Alan Thompson, together with Neil Lennon, John Hartson and Rab Douglas, all have over a year left on their current deals. But the manager wants such experienced men to stay longer, to help bring the youngsters through. By retaining them, O'Neill also hopes to prevent a repeat of losing talents like Liam Miller, who joins Manchester United this summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
