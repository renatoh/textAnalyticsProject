Those youngsters, such as the Coles, Ashley and Joe, of Arsenal and West Ham, and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard, have been brought on by the foundations Wilkinson has laid in restructuring the way the game is taught. The NFC, to be built on a green field site at Rangemore, five miles west of Burton upon Trent in Staffordshire at a cost of \u00a330m, represents the topping out. When the centre, which will be funded by the FA and not the National Lottery, opens in the summer of 2003 it will become the base for every England team from the under-14s upwards. The complex, which is Wilkinson's brainchild, is partly modelled on France's equivalent at Clairefontaine, near Paris. There will be 13 pitches, three of which will be of Premiership standard and with under-soil heating. One of them will even provide a replica of the Wembley pitch. \"The centre will be better than any other facility in the world,\" he said. \"There will be state of the art pitches, sports science and sports medicine.\" The purpose of the project, however, is not just to improve the players but also the coaches; while there are more than 50,000 Uefa-certified coaches in Germany and almost 18,000 in Holland, there are fewer than 1,000 in Britain. Wilkinson and around 75 staff will be based at the 350-acre site which has been chosen because of its central location. More curious is the centre's proximity to Burton, the brewing capital of England. It seems the proprietor of the nearby Rangemore Club is already preparing for the invasion of thirsty footballers. \"New members welcome,\" says the sign outside. Sven-Goran Eriksson, for one, will not be impressed. Darren Anderton is out of contention for England's friendly against Spain this month after suffering an achilles tendon injury, which will rule him out for at least a fortnight. Anderton was hoping to be included in Eriksson's first squad as England coach, which is named on February 23. But he picked up the injury at Manchester City last Saturday and will miss Tottenham's FA Cup fifth-round encounter with Stockport at White Hart Lane tomorrow. Roberto Mancini has brought his brief spell in English football to a premature close after flying back to Italy and informing the Leicester City manager Peter Taylor that he has no plans to return to Filbert Street. Taylor confirmed last night that the veteran Italian striker had left after becoming homesick during less than four weeks in the east midlands. Reports in Italy, however, suggest that Mancini is being lined up as a replacement for Fiorentina's Turkish coach Fatih Terim. \"It's a big blow,\" said Taylor. \"With the club's permission Roberto went back to Italy for a few personal reasons earlier in the week but we were expecting him back to return in time to play against Bristol City in the FA Cup on Saturday. \"Instead he has telephoned to say that he is staying in Italy. We've agreed to speak again next week but if this means that he is not coming back I am still very pleased with his contribution for the short time he was with us.\" Mancini was Eriksson's right-hand man at Lazio and joined Leicester on the England coach's recommendation on a month-long contract that was expected to be renewed until the end of the season. There was better news yesterday for Arsenal as Gilles Grimandi agreed terms for a new contract which will keep him at Highbury next season. Meanwhile, Steve Archibald insists he now has nothing to do with Airdrie Football Club after his contract was terminated by liquidators KPMG. He says responsibility for this weekend's Scottish Cup tie against Peterhead - and the survival of the First Division side - now lies in their hands. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
