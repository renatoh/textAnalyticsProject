They are interested only in that small part of you which can or can't do the job they have advertised. Sadly, many of us are so flattered by questions such as, 'Tell me about your strengths' that we take it as an invitation to gabble and make fools of ourselves. 2 Never think that bundles of enthusiasm is enough. Sit down with a pen, paper and the job description, and work out the skills and qualities they are looking for. 'Itemise your technical/professional skills as they parallel the requirements of the job,' says Martin John Yate in 'Great Answers to Tough Questions' (Kogan Page, \u00a38.99). 'Then recall an incident to illustrate each of those skills. When you have done this, and not before, you will be in a position to begin justifying your ability and suitability.' Your tale about selling ice creams to colleagues in your lunch hour will demonstrate your entrepreneurial skills and will lodge an image of you in their mind (even if they do think you are a bit grasping, in this case). 3 Remember that very few questions are lightly asked. If your interviewers are looking at more than a couple of candidates, they have probably worked up a list of eight to 10 questions to put to each person. In well-organised businesses, they will be making ticks and crosses in their margins as you give your replies. A waffling answer will show that you do not appreciate the value of the question. So think through how you can give strong, specific answers to questions such as, 'Can you work well in a team/on your own/ in a small business?' 4 Avoid giving them reasons to exclude you. You want to appear the sort of person who will help out in a crisis, make the tea sometimes even if it is not your job, be tolerant of others (whatever their age, sex, race or religion) and be easy to manage. Don't appear dogmatic, so avoid sentence constructions which sound strident ('One thing I cannot tolerate is...'). Don't attack your previous employer as it suggests you might attack your new one). 5 Try asking them the odd question. If you ask what sort of projects you would be likely to start work on, you might then get back some very useful feedback ('We need a new approach to managing this department since three people have left recently...'). If they start opening up to you, you can get into a more equal conversation and may have an opportunity to show that you can deal with the sort of situation they are describing. 'We are all, at some level, problem solvers,' says Martin John Yate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
