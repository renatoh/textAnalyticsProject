Not a Primark economy (everything made in China), not a Currys economy (the people in charge have no idea what they're selling), nor a Harrods economy (run by someone who believes the Duke of Edinburgh murdered his would-be daughter in law \u2013 sorry, wrong, that was the previous owner.) The Lib Dem leader wants an economy based on the practices at John Lewis, known to its fans as \"Johnny Lew\", so that the people who work for a firm have a stake in its success. John Lewis employees (or \"partners\") get a cheque every year, the size depending on the profits the firm has made. What a great idea for Britain! The government would have to run a surplus so that early in December every taxpayer would get cash back. That would sort the deficit out in no time \u2013 who would want to be the chancellor that announced there was nothing in the kitty this Christmas? And thanks to Mr Clegg we know now what was in the box that little boy was bringing to his parents on Christmas morning in the incredibly successful John Lewis TV ad: it was a nation where enterprise and initiative are rewarded within a framework which allows for a wider distribution of capital and influence through all stratas of society. No wonder they looked so grumpy. It has to be said that Mr Clegg, who usually gives the impression of a camera-shy sheep, spoke well. He was in the Mansion House, at the heart of the City of London, and he gave it to them with both barrels. Much of the time. It didn't start well. The chap who introduced him kept banging on about Turkey, and how Turkey is the bridge between Europe and Asia. Was he going to say, \"but enough about Turkey \u2013 here's a real turkey!\" He didn't. Clegg kicked off by asking who in the room was in favour of \"irresponsible capitalism\", which went down fine. Only half the people there put their hands up. (No, none of them did, of course not. But I'll bet some of them thought it.) He said it was about time that politicians stopped their \"abject failure\" to stand up to special interests, a point that might have been more forceful if, when he was asked which special interests he had in mind, he'd come up with something more than just \"the trade unions\". Then he went slightly berserk, but only slightly. There was no need \"to throw rhetorical rocks\" at capitalism. And he very elliptically told us that he didn't value John Lewis-style \"employee engagement\" simply because it was nicer. He was asked if there should be a new royal yacht. \"The debate is about the haves, and the have-yachts,\" he quipped, as merrily as Mr Clegg quips anything. It would cost too much. A rather disobliging vote of thanks from Mr Stuart Fraser pointed out that another firm that valued employee participation was Lehman Brothers, whose collapse started the present crisis. And later No 10 made it clear that if there is to be a new luxury boat it will have to be privately funded. The John Lewis Royal Yacht, for example \u2013 never knowingly undertowed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
