In this premiere, given by Carolin Widmann and Thomas Zehetmair's Northern Sinfonia, his piece also had a wilful intensity that lent it an unusual quality. In an arresting opening, the sensation was of opening the door on a piece already in full dramatic flow. Free of title or extra-musical association, the concerto is conceived in a single 21-minute movement, shaped in simple blocks with Widmann's solo violin the dynamic connecting presence, though never in the conventional virtuosic mould. The relationships established with other instruments, notably marimba, were intriguing, but it was the sense of a single instrument being allowed flights of imagination and lyrical soul-searching that emerged as the piece's most compelling element. In retrospect, Woolrich's concerto seemed to embrace romantic sensibilities, perhaps by dint of being cocooned in a programme of 19th-century German works. Florian Boesch was the baritone soloist in orchestral arrangements of Schubert lieder, five by Anton Webern with Britten's version of Die Forelle as the closer. Both Boesch's introspection and the nature of the instrumentation suggested Webern's aspiration to a Mahlerian cycle, yet all six seemed to betray Schubert's essential perfection. Zehetmair's affinity for Schumann was evident in his flowing account of the Third Symphony, though the lumpen brass was reminiscent of the time when Schumann's orchestration was still perceived as deficient."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
