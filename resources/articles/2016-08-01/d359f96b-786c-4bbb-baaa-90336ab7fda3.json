Near her, a man fell to his knees with head bowed and arms outstretched. Several people wept; some embraced. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it. It starts here,\u201d said Nabi after the service, pointing at her diaphragm. \u201cIt\u2019s the Holy Spirit, it takes over. I just surrender.\u201d Nabi was among about 200 people who had come to sing, sway and pray at St Luke\u2019s, a beautifully renovated warehouse in Gas Street, which opened its doors as a church in February. Now, according to priest-in-charge Tim Hughes, it regularly attracts a total of 500 people to its two Sunday services, which are characterised by loud rock music, chatty homilies rather than formal sermons, group prayer, and manifestations of God in the form of shaking or speaking in tongues. Before moving to Birmingham, Hughes, 39, and his wife Rachel spent 10 years at Holy Trinity Brompton, an ultra-evangelical church in west London known almost universally as HTB, which pioneered the famed Alpha courses and where Hughes was director of worship. The Hughes and their four children were joined by two dozen other members in relocating to Birmingham to establish St Luke\u2019s as a \u201cchurch plant\u201d. Members of the congregation are encouraged to commit to regular attendance and financial support by standing order. St Luke\u2019s is not unique. In July, Rich and Louise Grant and their two sons moved from Sheffield to \u201cplant\u201d a new church at St George\u2019s in Gateshead in partnership with HTB. Twenty other members \u2013 all younger than the thirtysomething Grants \u2013 are relocating to Gateshead ahead of the 25 September opening of the church, which aims to attract the city\u2019s student population. Alex and Liz Wood moved this summer from an HTB outpost in Brighton to Portsmouth to \u201cplant\u201d a church in a former department store in the city centre, assisted by part of a Church of England grant. Of \u00a3929,000, \u00a3179,000 is for the Harbour church and \u00a3750,000 for other evangelism projects. The Harbour church\u2019s mission statement is: \u201cTo play our part in the evangelisation of the nation, the revitalisation of the church and the transformation of society.\u201d St Matthias in Plymouth, led by Olly and Ali Ryder, formerly of HTB, will launch in September, with its first Alpha course kicking off three days after the church opens. Evangelical churches have also been \u201cplanted\u201d in Norwich, Lincoln and Bournemouth. All have strong links with HTB, all are led by husband-and-wife teams, and all are aimed principally at students and young families. \u201cWe want to connect with 18-30s,\u201d said Hughes. Ric Thorpe, another former HTB man who was appointed as bishop of Islington with special responsibility for \u201cchurch planting\u201d last September, aims to have 100 new worshipping communities in London by 2020. \u201cThere is a need to plant churches in new places to reach new people in new ways,\u201d he said. That the Church of England needs to reach new people is beyond question. The scale of its institutional atrophy was graphically illustrated by data earlier this year showing that church attendance was set to continue falling for another 30 years. Today\u2019s figure of 18 people per 1,000 regularly attending church would drop to 10 per 1,000, with an 81-year-old eight times more likely to go to church than a 21-year-old. In an attempt to stem this apparently inexorable decline, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has launched the church\u2019s biggest evangelism drive in a generation, with the goal of a religious revival among young people who are less likely than any other age group to identify themselves as Christians. Welby, himself a former HTB man who was prepared for ordination by Sandy Millar, HTB\u2019s vicar until 2005, is optimistic that his drive will succeed. \u201cI think the tide is turning in this country. We are seeing many churches growing,\u201d he told Michael Gove in an interview in the Spectator last December. In March, he told an evangelical gathering: \u201cI believe from the bottom of my heart that the long years of winter in the church, especially in the Church of England, are changing. The ice is thawing, the spring is coming.\u201d Church insiders say that, of those in contention to succeed Rowan Williams as archbishop of Canterbury in 2013, Welby alone grasped the scale of the church\u2019s decline and the need for decisive action if it was not to wither away. Since his appointment he has focused the church\u2019s energy and resources on an ambitious Renewal and Reform programme to refashion it as an outward-facing evangelistic \u201cmission\u201d rather than an institution sliding gently into its dotage. A third of the way through his expected 10-year term at the church\u2019s helm, Welby faces a critical few years. \u201cWe have a golden window to change the church,\u201d one evangelical bishop told the Observer. \u201cIf we can\u2019t turn it round in that time, it\u2019s over.\u201d Some see parallels with Tony Blair\u2019s mission in the 1990s to drag the Labour party into the modern age. Except, say critics, rather than taking the church into the mainstream, as Blair did with Labour, the focus on evangelism risks placing the church firmly on the fringe, in the hands of zealots. Many among the clergy and in congregations are uncomfortable and distrustful of charismatic practices such as speaking in tongues. There is also a belief that the established church of the country should be broad and inclusive \u2013 even if that means a little fuzzy \u2013 rather than narrow and uncompromising. \u201cActually, the more apt comparison is with Corbyn and Momentum,\u201d said one critic. \u201cThe diehards become more and more frenzied, while everyone else looks on in total incomprehension \u2013 and in many cases are repulsed.\u201d With regard to church planting, advocates point to astonishing numbers. St Peter\u2019s Brighton, which started five years ago with 30 people, now claims to be 800-strong. St Thomas Norwich holds five services on Sundays, and has grown from 50 to 450 attendees in two years. KXC, a church launched in 2010 in King\u2019s Cross, London, has 500 regular worshippers, nearly all in their 20s, says Thorpe. He drew a rough graph, showing the downward trajectory of the traditional congregation and the upward trajectory of the \u201cgrowing church\u201d. \u201cThe evidence suggests that the institutional church is in decline. But you have these two things happening at the same time: an ageing way of doing church is becoming less popular, but there\u2019s a new movement of young people particularly in situations of growth. If you draw those curves together, there will be a bottoming out,\u201d he said. Critics say attendance figures at new churches rarely represent genuine new growth, but are largely due to \u201csheep stealing\u201d \u2013 poaching existing members of other congregations \u2013 and attracting students looking for a new place to worship after leaving their \u201chome church\u201d. They also claim that the congregations of church plants do not reflect the demographics of their inner-city locations, but are overwhelmingly white, middle-class young professionals. Although it may appear to be a grassroots phenomenon, church planting is a key part of Welby\u2019s strategy \u2013 and gets generous support. The allocation of church funds is a crucial way of effecting change in an institution whose running costs are about \u00a31bn a year (much of it going to cover its vast pensions liability). According to a senior source, \u201cmoney used to be handed over on a formulaic basis, and the dioceses could spend it how they liked. And the formula was perverse \u2013 if [church] attendances fell, you got more money. It was the wrong incentive structure.\u201d From January next year, funding will be allocated to two streams. One will go to poor areas, mostly deprived inner cities; the other for \u201cstrategic development\u201d, with church planting taking centre stage. Ric Thorpe said: \u201cWhat\u2019s changed is that [the church] is now saying, we want this money to go towards growth \u2013 which, when it\u2019s in decline, is a wise investment. In this new thinking, you\u2019ve got to demonstrate that you\u2019ve got a plan, that you\u2019re putting [funding] to good use, that it\u2019s not going to something that\u2019s dying. There\u2019s an urgency about this.\u201d He says small rural churches have a higher number of clergy per capita than dense, urban parishes. \u201cWhere the population is denser, there are fewer clergy around to reach those people. If we are an outward-facing church we need to position people where they\u2019re most needed: 83% of people live in urban areas, but 83% of [church] finance doesn\u2019t go there. But it should.\u201d The church, he said, needed to help some rural parishes \u201cface reality\u201d. Some of those parishes, historically the backbone of the Anglican church, are wincing in pain. Another key plank of the Renewal and Reform programme is the goal of recruiting 6,000 priests over the next 15 years, to be \u201cthe leadership of the church in the 2030s, 40s and 50s\u201d, says the church\u2019s secretary general, William Nye. About 70% of those selected for ordination are reported to be evangelicals, a figure likely to increase. Some study at St Mellitus College, an HTB-inspired ordinand training centre based in London with outposts elsewhere in the UK, which is the fastest-growing ordinand college in England. St Mellitus had nine students in its first year, 2007. Last year the number was 215. \u201cSt Mellitus is training in a new way, with a new ethos,\u201d said Graham Tomlin, its president and the bishop of Kensington. Ordinands are attracted by its \u201clively, energetic, can-do, positive atmosphere\u201d, he added. Not all students were from an HTB background, but HTB\u2019s missional approach was central to college life. \u201cFifty or 100 years ago, it didn\u2019t matter what you did as a priest, people came to church anyway,\u201d said Tomlin. \u201cNow we need the kind of people who can build an outward-looking church with energy and vision.\u201d Tomlin and Thorpe are part of a cohort of bishops and key officials driving the church in an evangelical direction. They include Chris Russell, Welby\u2019s adviser on \u201cevangelism and witness\u201d. Evangelism and evangelicalism were different, he pointed out; people from any tradition in the church could evangelise; but evangelicals insist on the Bible as the sole authority. Nevertheless, the church\u2019s most ardent evangelists appear to be evangelicals. According to Ian Paul, a member of the Archbishops\u2019 Council, the church\u2019s central executive body, there is a \u201cformidable representation of evangelicals\u201d among bishops, \u201cone without precedent in modern times\u201d. Listing 18 (out of 42) dioceses with evangelical bishops, Paul wrote in the Church Times in February: \u201cThe large number of evangelical bishops is just the episcopal tip of an ecclesiastical iceberg.\u201d Not everyone was happy with this. \u201cLiberals might worry about a threat to the \u2018broad church\u2019; conservative evangelicals will wonder why it remains so broad,\u201d wrote Paul. Some in the broad middle feel marooned and neglected by the scale and pace of reform. Martyn Percy, the dean of Christ Church Oxford, and one of the most outspoken critics of Renewal and Reform, said Welby had a \u201cgroup of very loyal lieutenants around him, but a lot of people in the church feel we\u2019ve become exiles in our own institution\u201d. The church, he said, was in the grip of a \u201csmall group of elite organisationally minded evangelicals who think the church is a biddable, shapeable, governable body, and that\u2019s not the case. The reality is complex, messy, knotty.\u201d Much of the talk of \u201cbeing stronger and fitter for the 21st century is simply not believed by most people. All indices show there\u2019s no growth, and a lot of the ways in which [evangelicals] talk about God is fundamentally offputting. More people are turned off than turned on.\u201d The church was \u201can institution, based on values and existing independently of the popularity of those values\u201d, not an organisation that could be remodelled and relaunched. \u201cWe need to love and cherish the institution, and growth may come, or it may not,\u201d he said. Robert Cotton, rector of Holy Trinity Guildford and a member of the Archbishops\u2019 Council until earlier this year, said there was \u201can increasing disconnect between the rhetoric of the overall [Renewal and Reform] programme, and the ministry we do in the parishes. I\u2019m fully behind Justin wanting to do something about the health of the church, but I\u2019m not sure the language, the rhetoric, of Renewal and Reform is connecting with the sort of experience I have as a parish priest.\u201d The emphasis on growth in membership left him uneasy, he said. \u201cMembership is not the language that I and those that live in the soggy middle of the CofE often use. Of course we want more people to come to church, but I don\u2019t think of the church essentially as a membership organisation.\u201d Evangelical churches expected a degree of commitment that many people felt unable to give, said Cotton. \u201cThe C of E for centuries has seen itself as a church serving the whole nation \u2013 the religious enthusiasts as well as those who are unable to demonstrate that sort of enthusiasm, but still take the moral life, the life of good character, the life of community service very seriously. And the church for years has wanted to value and nourish those people even if they can\u2019t sign up to every article of the creed. The danger is that if we become too much a membership church, we\u2019re actually shrinking our connection with the country.\u201d But, said Thorpe, the bishop for church planting, the status quo was not an option. \u201cIf you\u2019re stuck in the past, you will decline because effectively you\u2019re locking yourself into a certain way of doing things, and everyone else moves on \u2026 I want to see the traditions of the church continue and be honoured and celebrated \u2013 and for us to infuse some of the best things of those traditions into current worship practice. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want [tradition] to be a god in its own right, that we can\u2019t change, because then the church will never change and adapt. One of the roles of the church is to present the message of the gospel to each generation. If we only present it in one particular way, to one particular generation, people will vote with their feet.\u201d BROAD CHURCH: THE MAIN ANGLICAN DIVISIONS Anglo-Catholics The sacraments are central. Services are characterised by the wearing of vestments, incense, bell ringing and silent prayer. Many opposed the ordination of women and the appointment of women bishops, and resist liberalisation of the stand on gay marriage. Some have left for the Roman Catholic church. Traditionalists Probably the largest (if least vocal) grouping. They believe in God, Queen and country \u2013 and a church presence in every town and village. They form the congregations of many traditional parish churches, and are the backbone of the Women\u2019s Institute, Mothers\u2019 Union and other Middle England institutions. Think Vicar of Dibley and the local church fete. Liberals Believe the church must be responsive to the world. The gospel can be \u2013 and has to be - reinterpreted for changing circumstances if the church is to be relevant to society. Women and gay clergy are embraced. Church of England liberals tend to be active in social action schemes and interfaith projects. God is green \u2013 and occasionally female. Evangelicals The authority of the bible is paramount and, for some, not open to reinterpretation. Evangelicals seek a direct and personal relationship with God. Worship is characterised by rock music, swaying and arm waving, hugging \u2013 and, for \u201ccharismatic evangelicals\u201d, speaking in tongues or possession by the Holy Spirit. Conservative evangelicals are biblical fundamentalists, but many British evangelicals \u2013 represented by Holy Trinity Brompton and the popular Alpha courses \u2013 appear more inclusive, although they are still theologically conservative. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 August 2016 to clarify the proportion of a Church of England grant allocated to the Harbour church in Portsmouth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
