In a development that goes to the heart of Blair's nervousness about the single currency, sources close to Cook say he was sacked only days before he was to agree a pact with Stephen Byers to push for a euro referendum in autumn next year if the economic tests are met. Significantly, Byers, the second most pro-European Cabinet member, was also moved out of the single currency limelight during the Prime Minister's reshuffle late on Friday night. Blair was so concerned that the Cabinet would be split in two by Cook's 'gung-ho' attitude to the euro he decided that he had to be moved. Blair believes Jack Straw, the new Foreign Secretary, is much less incendiary on the issue and can be trusted to work with Brown without communication breakdowns. The Prime Minister agreed to demote Cook to Leader of the House of Commons at a meeting last Thursday afternoon at his house in Sedgefield before the election results were known. Jonathan Powell, his chief of staff, Alastair Campbell, his official spokesman, and Anji Hunter, his special assistant, agreed that constant headlines about splits between Cook and Brown would damage the European project. Cook will be allowed to keep the Foreign Secretary's official residence at 1 Carlton Gardens as a consolation prize. Blair is concerned that the Chancellor is still sceptical about joining the euro. The Prime Minister wants to ensure any battle is between him and Brown with no 'external distraction from other departments', a Government source said. Although Downing Street officials insisted yesterday that the loss of Cook from the Foreign Office did not damage the chances of Britain joining, senior Labour Party figures said Brown's hand had been strengthened. 'Jack Straw has a record as a euro sceptic,' said one senior figure close to the Prime Minister. 'Robin may have had a bad image here among some of the press but on the Continent he was highly respected. People will find this hard to understand.' Senior Treasury officials have told The Observer that the five economic tests set by Brown for UK membership are unlikely to be met in the near future. The Chancellor is convinced that keeping the issue in its present 'holding pattern' makes it far harder for the Tories to make political capital out of the issue because they are split. Some well-placed Treasury strategists doubt there will be a referendum in this Parliament. Yesterday the Prime Minister finalised the rest of his new Government from Chequers. The Observer understands that Lord Macdonald, the former Transport Minister, is to be given sweeping powers as the Government 'enforcer' based in the Cabinet Office. Macdonald, a close ally of the Prime Minister, will be ordered by Blair to ensure that policies have an effect 'on the ground' in an effort to tackle public disillusionment about the state of hospitals and schools. Lord Falconer, one of Blair's closest political allies, is also to be given enhanced powers from his base in the same department, sitting on several committees and reporting back to the Prime Minister. John Denham, the former Minister for Health, and Baroness Symonds, at the Ministry of Defence, are also being tipped for major promotions. Keith Vaz, the controversial European Minister, is expected to be sacked. A face-saving formula will blame ill-health. Vaz is facing a second inquiry by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Elizabeth Filkin, after being strongly criticised for failing to co-operate with her earlier investigation into his affairs. Blair hopes a new flurry of appointments tomorrow will prove that the Government 'has momentum' and is getting on with job of improving public services. The significance of Blair's post-election reshuffle became clear yesterday. A senior Government source said that for the first time the Prime Minister had put in place a 'truly Blairite' Cabinet, with a series of appointments of people loyal to him including Charles Clarke, the new Minister without Portfolio and party chairman, who once said Brown should have stood for the leadership of the party because he would have been humiliated by losing. Patricia Hewitt, the new Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry, said Cook's move was a normal part of Government reorganisation. 'There aren't jobs for life in the modern economy,' she said. 'There have never been jobs for life in politics.' Tony Lloyd, the former Foreign Office Minister who served under Cook, admitted that his former boss was feeling 'bruised'. Yesterday, Blair's new Ministers spent their first day settling into their new portfolios. The new Home Secretary, David Blunkett, announced a war against crime and drugs which he said was the 'biggest scourge of the modern era'. Blunkett, who was switched by Blair from education, said: 'My own priorities will be crime, and particularly violent crime, and those who are trafficking in drugs, people and weaponry, and pulling the community together to be part of the solution.' Speaking outside the Home Office, he described drugs as the 'key corrosive element in dysfunctional families and within communities'. He vowed to crack down on pushers and 'the traffickers behind them who are making millions of pounds in profits out of the misery of others'. Margaret Beckett, the Secretary of State at the new Department of Rural Affairs, promised to tackle quickly the state of siege remaining in some country areas since the the onset of foot and mouth disease. 'After the problems in the countryside people are feeling very bruised and unhappy,' she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
