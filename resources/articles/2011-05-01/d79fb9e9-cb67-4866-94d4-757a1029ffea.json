The two brightest objects below and to the right of Arcturus are Saturn and Spica in Virgo, with the planet now close to the star Porrima and edging to within 0.3\u00b0, less than a Moon's breadth, by the month's end. Saturn still outshines Spica, but it dims from mag 0.5 to 0.7 in May as it recedes slightly and the ring-tilt decreases to 7\u00b0. Look for the Moon below Saturn and alongside Spica on the 14th when a telescope shows the planet's disc and rings to be 19 and 42 arcsec wide respectively. The other naked-eye planets are about to participate in their most compact grouping for years, though the event will go largely unobserved from Britain. For a day or two around the 11th, Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter lie some 25\u00b0 E of the Sun and so close together that they could fit into the same field of view in binoculars. From equatorial latitudes, where they are visible low in the dark E sky before dawn, the view should be breathtaking. Seen from Britain, though, all four worlds rise less than 45 minutes before the Sun, and twilight will swamp the spectacle. It might be worth looking very low in the E a few minutes before sunrise on the 11th when the brilliant Venus, mag -3.9, lies 0.7\u00b0 below-right of Jupiter (mag -2.1). Mercury, 1.5\u00b0 below-right of Venus, and Mars, almost 6\u00b0 to the left, will be too dim at mag 0.3 and 1.3 respectively. By the 29th, Jupiter rises almost 80 minutes before the Sun and stands 6\u00b0 beneath the slender and earthlit waning Moon. Eta Aquarids meteors, debris from Halley's Comet, peak in numbers on Friday but don't expect to spot more than a dozen of these swift meteors as they emanate from low down in the E after 03:00 BST. At least they have no moonlight to compete with.
