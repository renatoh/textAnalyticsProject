Over the last 30 years the NHS has been structurally dismantled under successive governments, leading to many of the serious failings that we are witnessing. US companies like Kaiser Permanente, McKinsey, Centene and United Health/Optum have been significantly involved in this, and in the delivery of NHS services. US-HMO style \u201cintegrated care systems\u201d are now being installed throughout England, although they are not statutory bodies and have no legal basis. These lack accountability following abolition, in the 2012 Health and Social Care (HSC) Act, of the health secretary\u2019s duty to provide key NHS services throughout England. Billions of pounds of NHS funds now flow annually to multinational healthcare corporations through commercial contracts. The changes brought about by the HSC Act effectively end the English NHS as a comprehensive, public healthcare system. This can only be reversed by legislation to abolish all NHS privatisation and to restore the health secretary\u2019s original duty. The NHS reinstatement bill provides legislative proposals for this. MPs including Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, the Green\u2019s Caroline Lucas, SNP\u2019s Philippa Whitford and Plaid Cymru\u2019s Hywel Williams were notable early supporters of the bill in 2015. Their parties\u2019 manifestos express their opposition to privatisation. The Labour and Green manifestos would also repeal the HSC Act and reinstate the health secretary\u2019s duty to provide universal public healthcare throughout England. The Tory and Lib Dem parties\u2019 manifestos express no such commitments.
