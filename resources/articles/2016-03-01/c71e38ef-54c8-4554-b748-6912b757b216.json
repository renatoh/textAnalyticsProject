In his back yard of Texas, Spieth is more the home star than the lone one. The world No1 requires just a halved match against his close friend, Justin Thomas, to progress to the knockout stage of the WGC-Dell Match Play. Spieth has looked far more like his old, accomplished \u2013 and fear-inducing \u2013 self at the Austin club, a venue he does not so much recognise as recall as a routine stop from his youth. Spieth joked on Tuesday about the unusual sight of an Austin hotel room; he is more accustomed to \u201ccrashing on my buddies\u2019 couches\u201d. Thursday\u2019s Spieth success was by 5&amp;4 over Victor Dubuisson. Much like the Wednesday win over another European, Jamie Donaldson, he never looked in trouble. This time, the 22-year-old was three up after only five holes. Spieth\u2019s confidence has been restored and in opportune time, with the Masters and a Green Jacket defence less than a fortnight away. Tales of Spieth\u2019s demise following a run of no top-10 finishes from mid-January were always overstated. The sense he would relish proving as much should not have been underplayed. \u201cAfter the first two holes I couldn\u2019t tell you how I was up,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s how matchplay works. I think it rattled him enough to be able to continue to advance that lead. \u201cIt\u2019s a great position to be in. There are no complaints on my side. I\u2019ve been striking the ball great. The middle of the front nine has really been a solid place for us. And when you are up three up and you are striking the ball well on a windy day with a difficult course, it\u2019s difficult for anyone to come from behind. It was nice to get done there on 14.\u201d But what of the dynamic between himself and Thomas, once the top-ranked college golfers in the United States? \u201cI know how badly he wants to beat me,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on the same team plenty of times in matches. I think it will be fun. Hopefully we can both start making some birdies and it\u2019s a good match with some good golf being displayed. We\u2019ve had dinner a couple of times this week. He\u2019s a good friend of mine. \u201cWe both want to beat each other. We obviously have a ton of respect for each other and each other\u2019s games. We have since we were 14 years old. He\u2019ll want to beat me bad; that\u2019s kind of just who we are. As much as I just want to halve the match and stay in tomorrow and practise, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to want that to be the case. I\u2019m going to have to bring my A-game.\u201d Jason Day\u2019s appearance on the 1st tee looked in doubt during a ginger warm-up session, the Australian having suffered from \u201csearing\u201d back pain during a Wednesday success over Graeme McDowell. Day took to the course, drove the opening hole \u2013 downwind, but all 381 yards of it \u2013 and converted for an eagle. Beware the injured golfer, indeed. Day never let that advantage over Thailand\u2019s Thongchai Jaidee slip, claiming a point by a scoreline of 5&amp;3. More importantly, there were no signs of physical impingement to the US PGA champion whatsoever. Rory McIlroy secured a second win in as many days, this time with an improved performance as he saw off Smylie Kaufman by 3&amp;1. McIlroy\u2019s final, crucial group match is against Kevin Na. \u201cMy confidence is higher than it was,\u201d the world No3 said. \u201cMy play definitely moved up another level. I hit some better shots and I made some more birdies. I feel good. I just need to beat Kevin and I go through. So it is nice to have that clarity.\u201d The biggest win of day two was for the Open champion Zach Johnson, who was a serious contender to claim the title even before an 8&amp;6 defeat of Martin Kaymer. Johnson even had the temerity to lose the 1st. Adam Scott, Bubba Watson, Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson were all victors, too. Mickelson\u2019s win was the strangest as his opponent, Daniel Berger of the United States, clipped a wall with his club during his downswing and missed the ball completely on the final hole. A two-word expletive, wrist injury and red face all followed for the unfortunate 22-year-old."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
