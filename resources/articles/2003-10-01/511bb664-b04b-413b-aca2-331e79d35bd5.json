For the Canberra game the fly-half Stephen Jones will return in place of Ceri Sweeney with a day off for the centre Iestyn Harris, who drew much praise for his display in Melbourne last weekend. Mark Taylor returns at outside-centre with Sonny Parker inside. \"We had the team pencilled in before the first game,\" said the Wales coach Steve Hansen. \"If we're going to be successful, we're going to have to use the whole squad.\" Six players will make their World Cup debuts against Tonga - the No8 Alix Popham, the lock Robert Sidoli, the hooker Mefin Davies, the prop Iestyn Thomas, the left-winger Tom Shanklin and the full-back Rhys Williams. Hansen will reassess his line-up after the Tonga match. \"Every time you wear the red jersey you have to play like you want to wear it again,\" he said. The Scotland coach Ian McGeechan has made nine changes to his starting line-up for the Brisbane Pool B match next Monday, with the scrum- half Mike Blair given a chance to stake his claim as the long-term successor to Bryan Redpath, due to retire and now out with an arm injury. Gregor Townsend starts at fly-half in place of Gordon Ross, with Glenn Metcalfe in for Ben Hinshelwood at full-back. The hooker Gordon Bulloch will captain the side. The survivors from the 32-11 win over Japan are Andy Craig, Chris Paterson, Tom Smith, Stuart Grimes, Jon Petrie and Simon Taylor. The Scots' flanker Andrew Mower, who is out of the World Cup because of a knee injury, will be replaced by Glasgow's Cameron Mather. Ronan O'Gara has been named for Ireland's Pool A match against Namibia in Sydney on Sunday as he attempts to win back his place as first-choice fly-half from David Humphreys. \"I definitely go into this game with something to prove,\" admitted O'Gara. \"Maybe not to myself but to the coaching team because they don't see me as a first choice at the moment.\" Wales: R Williams; M Jones, M Taylor, S Parker, T Shanklin; S Jones, G Cooper; I Thomas, M Davies, G Jenkins, G Llewellyn, R Sidoli, D Jones, C Charvis (capt), A Popham. Scotland: G Metcalfe; S Danielli, A Craig, A Henderson, C Paterson; G Townsend, M Blair; T Smith, G Bulloch (capt), G Kerr, N Hines, S Grimes, R Beattie, J Petrie, S Taylor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
