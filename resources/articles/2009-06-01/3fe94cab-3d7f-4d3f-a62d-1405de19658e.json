I am really fed up with Titanic metaphors, but will happily compare this government to the crew of the Mary Celeste, clustered in a leaky lifeboat while their ship floats away across the seas. They, like the Labour ministers, imagined there was some hope of rescue. They were wrong. Yesterday we had the first business question session since Lord Mandelson became business minister and Lord High Everything Else. There are now 11 ministers in his vast department, of whom six are unelected and sit in the House of Lords. None of them were in the Commons gallery yesterday, especially not Lord Mandelson. He usually comes to prime minister's questions, but only to make sure that Gordon is doing what he is told. It was Mandelson who famously said that Labour was \"intensely relaxed\" about people being \"filthy rich\"; to be fair, he added, \"as long as they pay their taxes\". The problem seems to be that Labour is also intensely relaxed about people being dirt poor, which may be the reason why just one voter in 20 woke up in the morning last Thursday and said, \"I know \u2013 I'll go and vote Labour today!\" The ministers left behind in the elected house seemed to be flailing around. Clearly nobody cared very much what they knew or what they thought. A Labour MP, Lindsay Roy, wanted to know what purpose the newly appointed Srallen Sugar would serve in the Lords. Pat McFadden \u2013 since Lord Mandelson is now in charge of outer space, he must serve as his representative on earth \u2013 flannelled that Lorshuggar (a Jewish reader writes: \"surely meshugger \u2013 Yiddish for mad\") was one of Britain's \"most well-known and respected entrepreneurs\". He would be an adviser, not a minister. So why does he need a peerage? Tories wanted to know why the bill to part-nationalise Royal Mail had been delayed. (Real reason: it would smash what's left of the Labour party.) Poor Mr McFadden said that it hadn't been delayed at all. \"It is a matter of time \u2026 we will try to find best value \u2026 the timetable may be a little longer \u2026\" Like the butler in The Remains Of The Day Mr McFadden longs only to serve his master, but sometimes finds it difficult to know how to do it. Moments later we had the weekly clash between Alan Duncan, shadow leader of the house and campest male MP, and Harriet Harman, the real leader and least camp woman in Britain. Mr Duncan pointed out that there were now fewer women in the cabinet. \"But she could never be dismissed as 'window dressing'. I'd immediately become the window-cleaner if she were!\" Whoo! as some MPs commented. If Graham Norton refuses to let the BBC dock his pay by 40% we need look no further for his replacement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
