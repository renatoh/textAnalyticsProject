It unveiled xCP on Monday at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas,\" reports USA Today. \"The idea is to embed xCP as widely as possible in digital music and movie files, as well as most kinds of playback devices. Once widely distributed, IBM says xCP will open up lucrative ways to sell digital content.\" Comment: IBM seems to unveil a new DRM system every couple of years. It's not clear how the latest effort relates to the EMMS (Electronic Media Management System) it was selling in 2001, if at all. Remember: \"The EMMS system was also used to offer downloads of Grammy nominated artists, the first public showcase of EMMS. RealNetworks was chosen as the featured application for playback of the copyright-protected downloadable music from the Grammy website\" (here). Actually, I quite liked IBM's 1996 version of DRM, which was called Cryptolopes, but of course, I may have missed a few."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
