While launching a census, he said that the ethnic composition of Australia's population would change if fertility rates stayed below replacement levels of 2.1 children per woman. The current rate is 1.8 children. \"There are some European countries with low birthrates and high immigration which have moved into this situation, and it has caused a lot of social division,\" he said. His comments provoked anger from ethnic minority groups."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
