It is based on the claim that Obama has roots in a village in County Offaly. I included a video clip of Shay Black belting out the song in California. He had added extra verses to the song, which was originally written by the Limerick band, Hardy Drew and the Nancy Boys. Now their song has been declared as a web hit on the BBC website today. So, courtesy of YouTube, here are the boys themselves singing about O'bama on RTE's Late, Late Show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
