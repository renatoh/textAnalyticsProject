He and best mate Leo (Thomas Turgoose) steal cars for profit and pleasure, often with Leo\u2019s giggling girlfriend, Kasia (Morgane Polanski, daughter of director Roman), along for the ride. Life is less of a lark at home, where Rob is the sole carer for his terminally ill father, Oswald (Tom Fisher), a former merchant seaman who has been abandoned to asbestos-related lung disease by his negligent employer. Oswald believes \u2013 or perhaps just vainly hopes \u2013 that Rob is out looking for work during the days. There\u2019s not much of that about in their small, port-town home (Hartlepool, though it\u2019s never named). All four of these central performances are excellent, but it\u2019s particularly satisfying to see Turgoose, now 28, demonstrate range far beyond the cute quirks and natural charisma he displayed as a child star: there\u2019s something appropriately Joe Pesci-esque about Leo, a character who is by turns mirthful and menacing. Turgoose isn\u2019t the only Shane Meadows echo here. Pannevis has folded a nifty crime thriller into a portrait of the post-industrial, Thatcher-ravaged north of England, which derives much of its tension from just how much you come to care for the characters. Background details are scant, and much of the emotion that passes between father and son is too intense to be spoken aloud. Still, a lot can be conveyed by bickering over oven chips and cassette recorders. The cinematography\u2019s wide expanses of horizon and open sea avoid the grim-up-north cliches and combine poignantly with bedridden Oswald\u2019s wanderlust-filled memories. It\u2019s this kind of political and lyrical film-making that lingers long after Rob\u2019s story has run out of road. \u2022 Looted is available on digital platforms from 6 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
