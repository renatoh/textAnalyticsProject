Thousands of passengers were stranded at the airport after some of the airline's loaders and baggage handlers stopped work in sympathy with sacked catering staff. BA was forced to accommodate passengers in hotels near Heathrow after deciding they could not run any short- or long-haul flights from terminals 1,3 and 4 at the airport. Union leaders had warned that a dispute that started yesterday could escalate if it was not resolved quickly. The row began when Gate Gourmet, a US-owned firm, sacked 800 staff over plans to restructure the company. That dispute has now hit BA, causing travel chaos for thousands of passengers at the peak of the holiday season. Sixty-two short-haul and 44 long-haul outbound flights, due to depart from Heathrow are reported to have been cancelled. A further 14 short-haul flights and an unknown number of long-haul flights which were en route to Heathrow were diverted to other airports in Britain, and other flights bound for London were being cancelled before taking off. BA outgoing chief executive Rod Eddington said the company was doing all it could to resolve the dispute. \"I am encouraging both sides to continue talking in a bid to settle their differences as soon as possible,\" he said. \"In the meantime we can expect to face continued disruption to our catering supplies for several days as it may take some time for the service to return to normal once agreement has been reached between the parties.\" Before BA suspended flights, the company handed out bags of food and gave vouchers to passengers so they could buy food and drink before they boarded flights. The airline said a number of long- and short-haul flights had taken off earlier today with a \"basic level\" of catering on board - mainly water, tea and coffee. Gate Gourmet, which also provides in-flight catering at other UK airports, including Gatwick, Glasgow, Bristol and Newcastle, sacked workers who had staged what the company called an unofficial strike. Tony Woodley, the secretary general of the Transport and General Workers union, called on BA to put pressure on Gate Gourmet to return to the negotiating table. He accused the company of behaving in a \"disgraceful\" fashion but said there was no blame on BA. Gate Gourmet said it was trying to change outdated working practices to improve productivity in the face of huge losses, and claimed that workers at Heathrow staged an unofficial strike yesterday which led to the dispute. The company insisted today that the workers who had been sacked would remain sacked. BA will want to avoid a repeat of disruptions that hit the airline two summers ago, when check-in workers staged an unofficial walkout. That stoppage left 100,000 passengers stranded and cost BA \u00a340m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
