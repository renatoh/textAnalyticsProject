Young Tottenham MP David Lammy boasted of reading that morning's Guardian. Young Tory leader, William Hague, went one better, revealing he not only reads the Guardian but checks www.theguardian.com/politics too. And unfortunately, on the David Lammy page it states he is not standing in Tottenham 2001. Mea culpa \u0096 a gremlin in our computer system was to blame. Good to know Conservative central office is checking the site though. As for our techies - we'll flog them later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
