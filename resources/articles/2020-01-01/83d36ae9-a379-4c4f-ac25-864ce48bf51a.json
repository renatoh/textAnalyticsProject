It\u2019s all there. The working-class boy who grew up in Birmingham, the comic forged in the fires of the pub/club circuit, the football fanatic who can\u2019t resist a (non-misogynist) knob gag. That\u2019s all leavened by late-era Skinner, who is more defined by a gentle wisdom, and a range of knowledge that means he can stumble across seemingly any obscure subject when chatting with the audience and know a bit about it (tonight\u2019s surprise specialist subject: wrestling moves). And when he jokes about how big his house is, he has the charm to get away with it. He is truly a man of layers. His new set, Showbiz, feels like hanging out with him in a bar. This is both a good and bad thing \u2013 Skinner is warm, impeccable company and his way with a punchline is still masterful. It also means the show feels insubstantial, that it doesn\u2019t add up to much, even if I did laugh a lot. The jokes are scattergun, which is fine for a while but feels disposable after 90 minutes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s asking too much of a gagsmith to alight on a subject for a little while, to get their teeth into it. I think the longest Skinner does this is his story about going \u201ctackle-out\u201d too early in a public toilet. Still, there are numerous brilliant moments \u2013 jokes about Prince Andrew\u2019s inability to lie, the joys of doing the conga, and why The Krankies do cruise ships. The subject of his age comes up more than any other: he is gloriously unashamed to talk about his waning sex drive. A section towards the end about celebrities feels tacked on to justify the show title, although his impression of hearing a neighbour playing Ella Fitzgerald records is an unlikely hit. One of Skinner\u2019s more underrated skills is his incongruous similes, which verge on the poetic. His bad shoulder turns his body shape into an Olympic podium. Correcting his \u201ctackle out\u201d error, he proceeds to the urinal with a hand underneath his member \u201clike a cat on a cushion\u201d. It\u2019s a comic gift, no doubt. And when he goes crude \u2013 like his twist on Call the Midwife \u2013 he makes sure it has full impact. It may feel a bit like a lap of honour \u2013 perhaps unsurprising after decades in the biz \u2013 but an evening in Skinner\u2019s company is still a delight. At the Garrick theatre, London, until 15 February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
