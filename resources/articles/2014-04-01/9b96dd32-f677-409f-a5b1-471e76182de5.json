Yet many American companies are not training new workers or re-training existing ones, and Congress isn't even close to passing any major jobs-related legislation \u2013 and hasn't since 2011. The biggest problem facing the country \u2013 10.5m people out of work \u2013 remains, but Congress is still fighting over paying unemployment benefits to those who have been out of work for over six months. Meanwhile many corporate executives, at companies including ChevronPhillips, say they need thousands more skilled workers \u2013 but they're certainly not actually hiring and are just hoarding more cash than ever. It would seem beneficial, then, for both corporate executives and lawmakers to reduce the unemployment crisis by training US workers. Enlightened self-interest, however, seems to be a lost concept in US business these days; its unwelcome replacement seems to be thick-headed short-sightedness. Our companies just can't figure out what's good for them, and they have good company in the US Congress. Obama did an end run around the issues at hand as well. \"There are some other folks in Washington that haven't acted yet,\" on the jobs crisis, he said in Pittsburgh. \"They haven't gotten the job done so far.\u201d It's a shame, because it's not as if there aren't good ideas about how to fix the unemployment crisis. They're just going ignored. So Obama stood before a mostly working-class audience at a local community college and tried to make two well-meaning but musty job-training programs look like a glittery spectacle of unicorns and rainbows. The event, designed to showcase the White House's commitment to jobs and education and show up an ineffectual Congress, will just end up highlighting how small a dent all of our corporate and political leaders have made in reducing unemployment. The programs the president promoted today, though perfectly fine on their own, will have very little impact at only $600m \u2013 an investment which, as Matthew Yglesias at Vox points out, is nearly invisible compared to the $18b allocated to existing job-training programs. The first of Obama's initiatives is actually four years old \u2013 the $500m tail end of a $2bn Department of Labor program called the Trade Adjustment Assistance and Community College and Career Training competitive grant program, or the DNA-like acronym TAACCCT. It was passed in 2010 to generate high-skilled, high-wage jobs. The other initiative, also from the Department of Labor, is a $100m apprenticeship program between community colleges and companies \u2013 another nice attempt at \"earn while you learn\". As Obama said, nine out of 10 apprentices get hired afterwards, with a salary of $50,000, but with only a few hundred thousands apprentices in the country, it's not even an option most Americans know exist. These initiatives are fine as far as they go, and they will change at least a few lives, which is better than nothing. Still, the scale of the US unemployment problem is so enormous and so persistent that it's perplexing that lawmakers have not considered \u2013 or united to act upon \u2013 some bigger solutions. The crisis mindset of the past six years should be over, as Mitsubishi UFJ Securities director of interest rates strategy John Herrmann told me. Emergency measures and bailouts are useless now, and the nation can only grow by planning ahead. \"At this stage of the game, it appears the economy is beginning to wean itself from the emergency programs,\" Herrmann said Wednesday. \"We expect the economy to become more self-reliant.\" You don't have to look far to find ways to deploy this self-reliance to improve in the jobs picture, and there are not only partisan solutions \u2013 they come from both the left and the right. One of the most popular: fix the country's crumbling infrastructure. This is the same option that worked during the Depression \u2013 build out the nation's infrastructure. Roads, bridges, highways and airports are all showing cracks, and fixing them would generate jobs for construction workers. Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, is a particular fan of this option, and there is existing legislation, the Delaney bill, that finds a way to pay for it. Economist Mark Price of Keystone Research suggested to me another infrastructure-related option: retrofitting school buildings to make them environmentally friendly. \"It also has a short-term goal of putting a lot of construction workers to work,\" he pointed out. The conservative American Enterprise Institute's Michael Strain also has a passel of intriguing options, some of which could find favor with even the most committed progressives. One of his ideas, for instance, is to offer vouchers to workers to move from areas with high unemployment to areas with better jobs. This solves a big part of the current jobs crisis, which is that rising house prices and high family debt make it hard for people to move to where the good jobs are. Another of Strain's solutions: worksharing instead of layoffs. Dr Kevin Hassett of Columbia University, who leans right, suggests that the government should just hire unemployed job seekers \u2013 an idea that sounds not unlike many aspects of the New Deal. There are other ideas out there, too, but few of them are making it to Congressional discussions \u2013 or the ones in executive suites. The deadlock in Congress is so persistent that Mitsubishi's Herrmann predicts that the only thing that can ease it is enough time and elections to change the makeup of those who are voting: \"It may take us six years or longer to get to that point of a unified view of how to address the national interests.\" Six years is a long time for answers that we potentially already have. It's a good time to ask why we're willing to wait."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
