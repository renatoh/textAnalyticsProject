Sol Campbell collapsed in despair the last time Spurs appeared in Europe. Much has changed at White Hart Lane since that defeat in Kaiserslautern, when Spurs were dumped out of the Uefa Cup by two injury-time goals, although the realisation that Bolton, Ipswich and Millwall have all tasted European football in the seven years since provides an unwelcome reminder of lost time. A new era begins tonight, however, as Martin Jol's side take on Slavia Prague in the Czech Republic. Those Spurs fans arriving in the Czech capital yesterday could be forgiven for wondering how a club that once set the standard for British football in Europe has been forced to stay at home for so long. Bill Nicholson's side were the first British club to win a European trophy, defeating Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to secure the Cup-Winners' Cup in 1963, and added Uefa Cup triumphs against Wolves in 1972 and Anderlecht 12 years later. Few of the current squad are old enough to recall those occasions but Ledley King can remember the bleak night in Germany in 1999 when Spurs went out in the second round. King was an unused substitute and never imagined he would wait so long to make his European debut. \"At the time you think it will happen regularly,\" said King. \"You didn't realise how tough it would be to get back into Europe. A team like Tottenham should be in Europe season after season, but we are delighted to be back in now.\" Tottenham's captain will make his second start in five months tonight after recovering from knee surgery, although doubts persist about the availability of Aaron Lennon and Dimitar Berbatov. Jol was \"surprised\" by Lennon's progress after initial reports suggested he might be out for a month. But the coach \"will not gamble\" on him despite Hossam Ghaly's absence with a groin problem. Slavia, currently seventh in Gambrinus Liga, are particularly strong at home, meaning that Spurs will be expected to soak up pressure and counter-attack. Slavia Prague (probable, 4-4-2): Vorel; Krajcik, Latka, Suchy, Hubacek; Janda, Jarolim, Hrdlicka, Svento; Vlcek, Fort. Tottenham (probable, 4-4-2): Robinson; Chimbonda, Dawson, King, Assou-Ekotto; Tainio, Jenas, Zokora, Davids; Keane, Mido. Referee: H Piccirillo (France). TV: Five, kick-off 7pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
