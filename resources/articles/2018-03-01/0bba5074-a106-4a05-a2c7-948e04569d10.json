Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s head of News Feed, said in a blogpost announcing the change that the experiment had been motivated by \u201cconsistent feedback\u201d that people wanted to see more from friends and family and less from media organizations and businesses on the News Feed. Starting in October, the company created a separate feed called \u201cExplore\u201d for so-called public posts in Sri Lanka, Guatemala, Bolivia, Cambodia, Serbia and Slovakia. The backlash from news organizations in the affected countries was swift. \u201cFacebook doesn\u2019t think about consequences and has no interest at all in what is happening inside its test countries,\u201d wrote the Slovakian journalist Filip Struh\u00e1rik, one of the most prominent critics of the experiment. In December, Struh\u00e1rik used CrowdTangle data to show that the experiment was hurting professional media more than fake news. \u201cYou gave us our answer: people don\u2019t want two separate feeds,\u201d Mosseri wrote. \u201cIn surveys, people told us they were less satisfied with the posts they were seeing, and having two separate feeds didn\u2019t actually help them connect more with friends and family.\u201d Mosseri also acknowledged the criticism that Facebook had acted high-handedly by completely changing the media landscape for six countries without warning or input from stakeholders, stating that the company would be \u201cupdating the way we evaluate where to test new products, and how we communicate about them\u201d. The end of this experiment is separate from changes to the global News Feed rolled out in January that are supposed to more modestly reduce public content and promote \u201cmeaningful social interactions\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m glad that Facebook will end this test and I am even more pleased that Facebook admitted that they made mistakes when they didn\u2019t communicate the test clearly,\u201d Struh\u00e1rik tweeted on Thursday. \u201cI hope Facebook will have more interest in what is happening inside its test countries.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
