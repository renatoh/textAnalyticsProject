MJ Delaney's film explores various resistible ways of opening out Rachel Hirons' stageplay When Women Wee, set over one evening in a Croydon nightclub's loos: attitudinous musical interludes, in-yer-face puking inserts, cutaways to Kate Nash snorting coke to the accompaniment of a comedy bugle. When the pottymouthing stops, it emerges that Hirons has points to make about female status anxiety \u2013 but Powder Room is only as empowering as anything else that might go out on ITV2 after the watershed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
