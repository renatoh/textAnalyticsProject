Carlisle United go the distance. They wear \"Stobart\" on their shirts. On Saturday they went to the fifth of five minutes of added time to win 2-1 against Huddersfield Town, two places above them in League One, and reinforce their play-off credentials in sixth position. Greg Abbott, their manager, said: \"That's as excited as I've ever been.\" He did not hide it. \"I think I ran three times round Simon [Grayson, Town's manager],\" to whom he apologised. It was a caper out of character. \"I don't know why I reacted like that,\" he went on. \"Football can make you a different person. You can be quiet and serious for the rest of the week then, come those 90 minutes [or 95], you start acting like I did.\" Carlisle have come late to the promotion shake-up, appreciating the long haul. For most of the season, while the Terriers have been snapping at the ankles of the two Sheffields, they have been below the radar, initially around 10th, mostly seventh since December. Seven unbeaten games in March have yielded 15 points and pushed them into the picture. They have picked up 24 points from losing positions, the most in the division, though this time they were never behind. Grayson was unbeaten in eight since replacing Lee Clark at Huddersfield and Abbott saw the match as a \"crackerjack\" in waiting. He was dead right in terms of drama, though Town were more lumberjack than livewire. The force was with Carlisle almost throughout, thanks largely to the tenacity of the lightweight middle of a 4-3-3 formation, none older than 23. Liam Noble was the eyes, Tom Taiwo the tigerish tackler. Both are 5ft 6in. The Terriers were out-terriered. In front Fran\u00e7ois Zoko's trickery and the line-leading of Lee Miller gave them ready outlets. \"Our ball retention and work rate were poor,\" said Grayson. \"We could have been dead and buried in the first half.\" In fact they were alive and almost triumphant in added time. Carlisle did not take the lead until the 48th minute. Just before the interval Noble hit the post that Zoko had earlier grazed with an overhead kick. Just after it a 12-man move ended with Zoko feeding Frank Simek's overlap and James Berrett burying the cross against his former club. \"That was as good a goal as I have seen in my tenure,\" said Abbott. Before the hour Grayson made a double substitution, bringing on Alan Lee to sharpen an attack in which Jordan Rhodes, scorer of 33 League goals this season, had not been brought into play. His providers might have been bees on pesticides. On 80 minutes Lee crossed early from the left for Lee Novak to knock in at the far post. Added time was a match in itself. Noble sent Jordan Cook away but Alex Smithies blocked. Lee, slipped clear by Rhodes, saw his cross-shot beat Adam Collin's dive and come back off the far post. Finally Carlisle won a free-kick just outside the penalty area. Far from the standard blast into the wall or chip into the crowd \u2013 even David Beckham's goal percentage from there was pretty low \u2013 they creditably tried a training-ground drill, which ended in a hoof to the halfway line, where the captain, Danny Livesey, stood guard. He returned a howitzer and, as the mob moved upfield and Smithies froze, Miller backed alone towards the penalty spot and backheaded over him into the net. It might have been touched by the aliens Michael Knighton, former owner and manager, was once reported to have seen. Livesey said: \"I tried one before. It went for a goal-kick.\" He also denied a special job on Rhodes. \"The lads will tell you I've no idea about any other player. I think he was due a quiet game.\" Carlisle now have a goal difference of zero, where the next lowest above them is 24. In 2004 they dropped out of the Third Division and came back at once to find it was League Two. That year in the Conference their now award-winning pitch was under water to the crossbar as the Eden burst its banks. Now they are riding the flood tides of March and confidence. No one, especially Huddersfield, will want them in the play-offs. As the nation blows hot and cold over pasties, they are comfortable in their skin, like a Cumberland sausage \u2013 all except the prancing Abbott."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
