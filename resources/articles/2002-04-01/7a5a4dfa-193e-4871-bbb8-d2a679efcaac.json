He is still viewed as the greatest British blues-rock guitarist that ever lived (although some argue in favour of Eric Clapton), and as rock's second most notable acid casualty (behind Syd Barrett). The stories of how he gave away all his money and didn't pick up a guitar for near-on three decades are the stuff of rock folklore. When he started to get himself together in the late 1990s, a harrowing TV documentary showed him dribbling and falling asleep as his manager negotiated a business decision. Now, though, Green is rehabilitated and his excellent band Splinter Group are well established on the blues scene, which allows them to play large or intimate gigs according to Green's state of mind. Here, before young and old blues fanatics, the mood is mostly for covers rather than the Group's own material. And it's a surprise to discover the extent to which Green's musical faculties have reawakened. A portlier, slower-moving figure than the handsome man who wrote the Mac's early hits, Green begins gingerly, with a trio of Robert Johnson songs. Intriguingly, the band operate as carers and provocateurs, teasing Green into producing his best performances with playful taunts such as \"old-timer\". Green says nothing, but manages a sliver of a grin. By the time he plays The Stumble, the Freddie King song that Green first popularised as guitarist in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, his slide guitar is in full flight. His singing isn't what it was (thus Man of the World is delivered as a haunting instrumental), but to hear Green tackle I Believe My Time Ain't Long is to understand the very nature of the blues. Green doesn't often bow to Mac nostalgia, but he cuts this crowd more slack with mesmerising renditions of Albatross and Need Your Love So Bad. Black Magic Woman is an unexpected treat: a 10-minute, largely improvised rendition with stratospheric, explosive soloing from Green. Old music, but new vigour. Eric who? \u00b7 Peter Green plays the Jazz Cafe, London NW1 (020-7916 6060), tonight and tomorrow, then tours."}, "isHosted": false}}}
