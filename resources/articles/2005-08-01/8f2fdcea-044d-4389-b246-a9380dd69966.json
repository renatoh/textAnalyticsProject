The story went mainstream, so to speak, on Tuesday morning when attention was drawn in these pages to the huge backlog of garments seemingly halted on container ships in the English Channel or sealed off in warehouses around Europe's borders. With Peter Mandelson's freshly imposed clothing caps having been breached almost as soon as they were imposed, millions of jerseys, blouses, pants and bras appeared stuck in a no-man's land of international trade. We drew attention to the plight of Mark Neale, who runs a small outdoor clothing specialist called Mountain Warehouse in south London. He has had to race around trying to find new suppliers to replace Chinese sources, who are unable to physically deliver their goods. Mark's fetching range of warm fleeces and assorted wind cheaters have now featured on just about every television network as news broadcasters seek to explain the tricky subject of global trade tensions to a mass audience. What's missing, though, as pundits debate the merits of bras sewn in, say, Portugal with those shipped from east Asia, is any firm evidence that there really are 408,000 of the things sitting out there waiting for their container ship to dock. In short, there is a growing suspicion that what we've really got here is a storm in a D cup. For a start, it now transpires that all this supposedly stranded apparel is, in fact, simply paperwork. The first step for anyone seeking to import goods from China is to obtain two licences: one from the EU to import and another from the land of unlimited cheap labour to export. Yet China was not even granting export licences until July 20 - more than a month after the EU imposed its newfangled quota scheme. To complicate matters further, importers don't apply to the EU, they apply to their home countries instead. Member states did not begin handing out their precious licences until July 13, but any apparel coming into the EU between June 10 and July 12 counted against the quota for the year. So retailers and other importers do have reason to scream - but it's about red tape, not stranded stock. The headline-grabbing figures are generated by the fact that bureaucrats have extremely accurate figures of how many items of clothing are being sought by retailers here, but which breach the new quotas. Which is not to say that Mark from Mountain Warehouse has been exaggerating his problems. Smaller operators have borne most of the pain as the new quotas have bitten. Moving suppliers imposes real costs - and those costs have an inverse relationship with scale. What's more, his oft-repeated point that capping Chinese goods will not save jobs in Italy, Spain or anywhere else in Europe feels intuitively correct. The average T-shirt costs \u00a37 to manufacturer in Europe and \u00a31.50 in China. In the meantime, we should also highlight the nonsense coming out of Mandelson's office in Brussels as this row has escalated. Bizarrely, officials insisted yesterday that they have been expecting this sort of disruption all along. They were well aware, for example, that Chinese-made pullovers were especially over-subscribed. Since the problems were likely to be temporary, they just decided not to do anything about them. His office was also claiming yesterday that it was always the intention that imposing quotas would cause supply chains to switch to - in Brussels' view - more worthy low-cost producers, such as those in Bangladesh. Yet the idea that Mandelson's subtle hand on the European trade tiller can quietly engineer a redistribution of manufacturing work to the benefit of struggling countries in the developing world is, frankly, laughable. Chinese textile quotas are not part of a brave new European social policy aimed at righting wrongs in the rest of the world. They are a eurozone-focused political fix - like most things that come out of Brussels. Taxing questions If nothing else, you have to admire Sir Digby Jones for his brass neck. Earlier this week he was complaining about the standard of school leavers. Barely a day goes by without the CBI banging on about the need for better roads and railways. But schools cost money, roads cost money, railways cost money. The idea, however, that a hard-up government should come knocking on the door of business for the taxes to pay for these things is anathema to Sir Digby. Make no mistake, the public finances are in no great shape. If the CBI is right in its forecast that the economy will only grow by 1.9% this year, the budget deficit will be higher than Gordon Brown is expecting. That doesn't mean the chancellor will have to raise taxes. Indeed, there are good reasons for him not clonking the economy on the head while it is heading downwards. But if Brown does decide that it is better to get any fiscal pain over earlier rather than later in the political cycle, then it is right that business, as well as the consumer, should pay its way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
