The science of get-up-and-go\u2019), which included some dietary case studies. It\u2019s not all that surprising to hear the infamously energetic Margaret Thatcher, then 49, say: \u2018You could say I eat to live rather than live to eat.\u2019 She reveals that she always has half a grapefruit and a boiled egg for breakfast, which was probably all she felt like after four hours\u2019 sleep. Barbara Cartland, 73, claims that she took 90 vitamin pills a day, which seems scarcely more credible than one of her own plots. But then again, she did live to 98. Yehudi Menuhin, 58, who also made it to a very ripe old age (83), tells us that he ate vegetables cooked in milk, but sadly not why. In \u2018The secrets of human energy\u2019, Richard Fisher writes about the importance of the mind as well as the body. \u2018The powerhouse may survive on hamburgers and coffee, but it is his psychological state that carries him forward.\u2019 Another feature asked, \u2018Is yours the right lunch to keep you going?\u2019 highlighting such staples as the \u2018pub lunch\u2019, defined as a \u2018steak pie, baked beans and half a pint of shandy. This will keep you going for 5 hours 50 minutes\u2019 and a \u2018snack lunch\u2019 of a doughnut and a cup of coffee, which \u2018will keep you going satisfactorily for 3 hours 20 minutes.\u2019 These are my kind of energy recommendations. Included in a list of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts is this gem: \u2018Don\u2019t take tonics. Many of them contain alcohol or opium. Stout may be a safe pick-me-up and it is still relatively cheap, but opium in any form is dangerous.\u2019 If only Renton in Trainspotting had heeded these words and replaced his opium suppositories with a half of stout."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
