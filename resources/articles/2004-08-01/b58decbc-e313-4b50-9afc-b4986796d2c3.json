The attention was difficult to avoid as the whole drama was played out on television. Former Special Forces soldier Ken Hames demonstrates how his colleagues rescued the hostages and, by doing so, turned themselves into national heroes. Made for Each Other? 8pm, Channel 4 Second marriages have a higher rate of divorce than first ones, and Jimmy and Ann have both been married before. They increase the odds against them by having childish and shocking rows that can last for up to four days. Before they bicker their way to another split, a psychotherapist and a divorce lawyer step in to try to prevent the couple from parting for good. Death by Silicone 9pm, Channel 4 Channel 4 continues its obsession with nauseating its viewers by showing close-ups of plastic surgery, presumably as a companion to the fake blood shown in Nip/Tuck. Now it's the turn of those unqualified, back-street plastic surgeons in Miami, who put their patients' lives in danger by injecting vast amounts of industrial-strength silicone and inserting dodgy implants. The programme tries to show some sympathy towards victims of these botched jobs, but things get ludicrous when one woman maintains that society is to blame for forcing her to enlarge her breasts. Nip/Tuck 10pm, Channel 4 Speaking of botched surgery, Sean (Dylan Walsh) has to mop up the mess when his teenage son tries to circumcise himself after getting instructions from the internet. Meanwhile, Christian (Julian McMahon) is in danger of turning into a more well-rounded character by appearing to acquire some morals, leaving everyone baffled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
