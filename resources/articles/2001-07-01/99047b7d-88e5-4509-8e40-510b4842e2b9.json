The clammy summer of 2001 is turning into a replay of the clammy summer of 1997. Tony Blair has just been elected with a colossal parliamentary majority. Snap. The Conservatives are divided and in disarray. Snap. The prostrate Opposition and the size of the landslide excites expectations in the media and the City that Britain is heading into the European single currency. Snap. A proprietorial Gordon Brown tells everyone to take a cold shower; he's in no rush to join the euro. Snap. Pro-European Ministers and Downing Street advisers whisper to sympathetic journalists that the Prime Minister is still hugely enthusiastic for the single currency. Snap. Speculation is further fired thanks to a front-page horoscope by the political editor of the Financial Times whose reading of the stars is that Britain is much likelier to enter than most people assume. Snap. Furious denials are issued on behalf of the Chancellor. Four years ago, the Treasury ridiculed the FT for printing 'bollocks'; this time, the Chancellor's men say that the City gazette is 'garbage'. Snap. Prime Minister and Chancellor separate for their summer holidays with no settled agreement between them. The rest of the Government head off abroad without a clue where they are on the most important issue to face Britain in a generation. Europe has never once been properly discussed around the Cabinet table. Snap, snap and snap again. Euro II is like one of those bad movie sequels. The disappointed punter begins to realise that the plot is identical to the first movie, which was itself a dreadful mess with a let-down ending. If history goes on regurgitating itself, then the end result will be the Chancellor inflicting a severe defeat on the Prime Minister. The difference this time around is that the subjugation of Tony Blair's ambitions to Gordon Brown's desires will be that much more humiliatingly palpable. Anyone who has spoken to him seriously about the subject knows that the Prime Minister has hardened in his enthusiasm for entering the euro. For Tony Blair, the single currency has never been fundamentally about economics. He has always perceived the euro as pre-eminently a matter of destiny: fulfilling his own as Prime Minister and making Britain one of the leading powers in Europe. As he put it in a confidential memo to his closest aides, Mr Blair regards the political case for entering the euro as 'compelling'. He has publicly described Britain's relationship with its continent as a 'tragedy' of late and grudging participation in every momentous initiative undertaken by the EU, mistakes for which we pay a large and constant price in lost influence. It has long been Tony Blair's deep conviction that Britain will not find its proper place in Europe until he has led us into the single currency, and he will not have secured his rightful plinth high in the pantheon of Prime Ministers. Hovering at his shoulder is the shade of Harold Wilson. He doesn't want to be written up as another trimming and tacking Labour Prime Minister who, while good at winning elections, didn't leave anything very grand by way of a lasting legacy. The question about the euro that bothers Mr Blair is not whether. His problem is how. It was because he could not find a convincing path through to winning a referendum that he didn't attempt entry during his first term. Even those who disagreed with the decision could understand why it was taken by a new Prime Minister obsessed with re-election. That delay could be presented, even to disappointed Europhiles, as shrewd tactics. There are - there always will be - excuses for again ducking the challenge of destiny. It is a mistake to think that Number 10 has a single opinion on the subject. Around Mr Blair are sceptical voices who fret about the risks of calling a referendum and losing. They point to the low turn-out in the election. The diehard antis would surely turn out to save the pound in a referendum. But can the Government be certain that it will be able to rouse the lukewarm and the apathetic? It is, of course, a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure to say that the Government daren't campaign for the euro for fear that it won't win the argument so it is best not to try at all. I think Mr Blair can grasp that a second flunk will leave him looking like a man imprisoned by his nerves. And crippled by his Chancellor. The how question is not what really interests Gordon Brown. He asks why? Why take risks with inflation and economic stability to join a weak and poorly managed currency? Why jeopardise his own, presently glowing relations with the Euro-hating press in favour of a project he isn't convinced by anyway? The Chancellor's call for a trans-Atlantic free trade area, another diversion from the euro which he chose to ventilate in the Daily Telegraph, must have delighted that paper's Europhobic North American proprietor. Why - so Mr Brown asks Mr Blair - get both of them entangled in a ferocious battle for an unpopular cause when the public will judge them on health, crime and education? Why - so Mr Brown asks himself - put any unnecessary impediments in the way of his progress to Number 10? Those who followed this plot on the last outing will have a strong suspicion about how it is bound to climax this time: the Chancellor will impose his determination to exclude the euro on a prevaricatingly nervous Prime Minister. Anticipating this denouement, other Ministers will steer clear of the argument between the big two. On Friday, the Foreign Secretary managed to deliver a speech on Europe which referred to the single currency in a few sentences as brief as they were bland. Journalists will continue to write speculative stories of varying degrees of reliability which will be exacerbated by weeks of spin and counter-spin from different orifices within the Government. In the autumn, Gordon Brown will steam into Number 10 to bludgeon Tony Blair. The Chancellor will tell the Prime Minister that the only way to close down the destabilising headlines that they are at war is for him, the Chancellor to make a definitive declaration of intent. Tony Blair was marooned at Chequers on the night in October 1997 when his Chancellor spun out a new line which killed off any chance of entering the euro in that parliament. Unable to locate Gordon Brown, mysteriously and conveniently missing during the critical hours, the Prime Minister was reduced to calling Charlie Whelan on his mobile phone at the Red Lion pub. When Mr Blair protested, the ineffable Charlie replied: 'Sorry, Tony, it's too late.' My astonishment that Blair had been so brutally bounced by Brown was shared by everyone else when I revealed this episode in the first edition of Servants of the People. I now have to admit that I did not totally fathom what a flailing moment this was for the Prime Minister. I have subsequently discovered that Mr Blair was in such a desperate state that night that he was reduced to ringing the Chancellor's then bagman not just once, but twice, to find out what Government policy on the euro was supposed to be. That was history as farce. If Tony Blair allows himself to be sandbagged by Gordon Brown for a second time, then it will be history as tragedy. That is his own word for it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
