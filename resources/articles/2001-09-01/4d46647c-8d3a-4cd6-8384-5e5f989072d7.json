Nobody was injured and little damage was caused by the hastily-fired rocket, but the incident was a major propaganda boost for the Real IRA and a blow to the intelligence services. The rocket was a RPG22, considerably more advanced than the RPG7s previously used by the Provisional IRA. Manufactured either in Bulgaria or Russia, it had been obtained in the former Yugoslavia, which is awash with surplus weaponry. On Friday, three Irishmen were remanded in custody at London's Belmarsh magistrates court charged with trying to procure more arms and explosives in Slovakia. The court heard that an elaborate undercover operation by British intelligence agents had started last November, when contact was made with an alleged Real IRA member, known as Karl, but believed by the prosecution to be Irishman Michael McKevitt, who is not now in Britain. Meetings followed in Hungary in February, March and April, during which the three men now under arrest requested arms, explosives and \u00a315 million sterling, under the impression that the undercover agents represented the Iraqi regime, says the prosecution. At a final meeting, on July 5, in Slovakia, attended by the three Irishmen and the bogus Iraqis, a detailed discussion of their requirements took place, Friday's court hearing was told, and the trio were arrested by Slovakian police. There were few problems in transferring the men from Slovakia to the UK last week because of an extradition treaty between the two states. British intelligence agents are expected to give evidence at the trial. Offers of the kind of weaponry allegedly discussed would be a major attraction to the Real IRA, particularly as they were apparently going to be supplied free, courtesy of Saddam Hussein. The Real IRA is said to be so cash-strapped that one of its leading bomb-makers, previously full-time with the Provos, has had to take a day job. Big robberies have proved difficult for the organisation because of paid criminal informers. The Real IRA was also hard hit by the seizure in Split, Croatia, last year of a major arms shipment already paid for with cash earned primarily from smuggling cigarettes and other contraband. It is believed that the British intelligence services and the Irish Garda were involved in the seizure, which included seven RPG18 rocket launchers, dozens of AK assault rifles and blocks of demolition explosive, known as TM500. In 1kg blocks, TM500, detonated electronically, can be used on its own or to set off huge, home-made fertiliser explosives of the type used in the Omagh massacre. The haul also included frequency-hopping transmitters, previously used by the Provisional IRA for remotely-detonated roadside bombs to hinder British Army electronic devices, which block detonation signals. Possession of the devices worries security forces on both sides of the border. The Real IRA is believed to have used 'hoppers' in a bomb attack on the cross-border railway line over a year ago. The device was detonated by a mobile phone. The hoppers came in a shipment from Croatia in autumn 1999, which included TM500 explosive and RPG rocket launchers. One of the rocket launchers, an RPG22, was abandoned in an abortive attack on a Co Tyrone police station in February last year, the first evidence that the Real IRA had them. This advanced rocket launcher, manufactured in the mid-Nineties, can penetrate up to six inches of armour plate or a metre-thick concrete wall. Similar weapons were captured in a Garda raid in Stamullen, Co Meath, in October 1999. TM500 explosives were used in two London bombings last summer. The security services will consider the prosecution a major coup if Fintan Paul O'Farrell, 37, Declan John Rafferty, 41, and Michael Christopher McDonald, 44, all from Co Louth, are convicted. In the Republic, the authorities consider that they have inflicted major damage on the Real IR\u00c5 through close surveillance and co-operation between security services in Dublin, London and New York. Despite this, the Real IRA stands to reap the harvest from hardline Provo supporters disenchanted by the stale-mate in the peace process."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
