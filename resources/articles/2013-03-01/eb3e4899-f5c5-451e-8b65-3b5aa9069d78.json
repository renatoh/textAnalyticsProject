The English pair of Tuilagi and Brad Barritt will be up against Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies, with all four players vying to impress the watching Lions coach Warren Gatland. Gatland has suggested a third of his probable Lions party of 37 remains undecided and admitted the title decider at the Millennium Stadium could clinch a seat on the plane to Australia for those who perform well. It raises the stakes even higher for both sides, with Tuilagi keener than ever to smash a few holes in the well\u2011organised Welsh defence. \"We'll be coming up against two of the biggest centres in the competition in Jamie Roberts and Davies, so it's going to be a massive challenge,\" acknowledged Tuilagi, scorer of England's solitary try in their last three Tests. \"But you always love the challenge and it's another massive test of where you stand. We're going for the win, nothing more nothing less.\" Tuilagi's physicality is an obvious weapon and the 21-year-old, who scored a try against Wales on his Test debut in 2011, is confident England will rediscover their cutting edge in attack. \"If you run the right lines at the right time, you can [breach defences]. It's up to us to identify those, do it in training and then take that on the pitch.\" As for defence, Tuilagi reckons England can withstand whatever is thrown at them. \"They're very direct and big but our defensive system has been working really well in the last four or five games.\" Tuilagi is among a sizeable contingent of England players who have never previously experienced the raucous atmosphere at the Millennium Stadium but he is relishing the prospect. \"We believe in ourselves and we showed that in France last year and this year against Ireland,\" he said, reiterating that England have not lost a Six Nations game away from home for two years. \"It showed we can win when we go away to tough places. I have never been to the Millennium Stadium but I have always wanted to play there.\" Roberts, who sat his final medical exams this week, toured South Africa with the Lions in 2009 and forged an outstanding centre partnership with Ireland's Brian O'Driscoll. For that reason the Cardiff Blues centre remains an extremely strong Lions candidate, particularly as Wales have not conceded a try since the first-half of their opening game against Ireland. Tuilagi and Barritt, though, have been central to England's improving fortunes, impressing together in the spectacular victory over New Zealand in December. Gloucester's Billy Twelvetrees was outstanding at inside centre against Scotland last month when Tuilagi was absent through injury but there is an obvious role for Barritt's calm defensive organisation and excellent tackling skills this weekend. The Saracens centre has missed just one of England's 16 Tests under Stuart Lancaster since making his debut against Scotland at Murrayfield last year. He would dearly love to help England secure a first grand slam since 2003 and insists the hunt for Lions recognition is a peripheral distraction for all concerned. \"I don't think any player needs more motivation than a grand slam decider,\" he said. \"At this point in time it's all about England winning the grand slam.\" England's management are due to reach a decision on Joe Launchbury's injured elbow on Thursday when they unveil their starting lineup. If the Wasps lock is ruled out, Courtney Lawes and Mouritz Botha are both set to featurewill be included in the 23-man match-day squad. England also say they will not decide until later in the week whether they will cede to Wales's desire to have the Millennium Stadium's sliding roof shut for the game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
