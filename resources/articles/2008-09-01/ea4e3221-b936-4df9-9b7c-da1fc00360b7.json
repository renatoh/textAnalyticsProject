Tired of their neon-lit, customer-dodging lives of frustration, middle-aged alcoholic Roger and pensive young goth Bethany find an exit route of sorts when Bethany discovers Roger's diary and is put out to discover he has been writing entries pretending to be her. So she starts adding to its pages herself and the stage is set for a morose repository of creative writing, furious bitching and heartbreaking asides. Roger's extended riff about two Scotch-glugging would-be wits includes a wonderfully ornate account of the life of a piece of toast that in a moment sums up life's missed chances, cul de sacs, \"staleness and lost elasticity\". Bethany replies with constructive criticism, food parcels and letters from a trip to Europe. Coupland's pastiches are affectionate, and his novel's occasionally irksome structure is redeemed by some lovely moments of pathos, in which everyday struggles are given a proper and touching weight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
