It occasionally felt like a very hyperactive pitch: a wacky idea presented to studio executives by overcaffeinated writers, who\u2019d thought it up in the corridor just before the meeting. The finished product brazens everything out with surreal chutzpah. The idea is that babies really were delivered in little bundles via storks in ye olden days, until other, unspecified methods were popularised in modern times. So these storks threw themselves into a new service industry: delivering stuff that people have bought online. But then one day a lonely kid, whose work-obsessed parents are neglecting him, writes to Stork Central asking for a sibling. (So stork-baby-delivery sort of can happen in the modern world \u2026 which doesn\u2019t quite mesh with the storks\u2019 supposed hilarious obsolescence in this regard. But no matter.) Meanwhile, a lone human employed in Stork HQ \u2013 a baby accidentally left behind, like Will Ferrell\u2019s Elf \u2013 takes it upon herself to deliver this baby, and causes chaos in so doing. Some wacky Tex Avery fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
