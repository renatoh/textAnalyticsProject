The phenomenally popular subsidy has provided up to $4,500 of taxpayers' money to buyers ditching old, pollution-belching vehicles for more fuel-efficient new models. But it has drawn flak from Barack Obama's Republican opponents, who view it as a waste of money. By yesterday morning, the scheme had contributed to more than 600,000 vehicle sales. The US transport secretary, Ray LaHood, told reporters he expected the figure to be higher by the 8pm deadline. \"Once the program ends at 8 o'clock there will be 700,000 to 800,000 cars that have been sold, most of them fuel-efficient,\" said LaHood. Initially funded with $1bn of public money, Congress authorised an expansion in the program's financing to $3bn. The initiative has put a spark back into Detroit's ailing motor manufacturing industry \u2013 Ford added extra shifts to its production lines and General Motors recalled 1,350 laid off workers to help meet demand. Car dealers across the country reported swift business as the deadline approached. The US department of transport's website failed briefly, due to the high volume of traffic, prompting officials to extend the deadline for dealers to file paperwork until noon today. Shopping for a Honda at a dealership in Berlin, Vermont, one couple said they were trading in a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee. \"We kind of dragged our feet,\" said Annette Palmer. \"Then we heard it was closing so we picked up our feet and ran.\" Some dealerships have reported shortages of popular models, which include the Ford Focus and the Toyota Corolla. President Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said the government had tripled the number of workers dealing with applications in order to deal with the rush. Gibbs said the scheme \"was supposed to be temporary and has been enormously successful, so much so that we're winding it down\". The Obama administration views the scheme as a promising example of economic stimulus successfully revitalising consumer demand during a recession. But critics on the Republican side are skeptical, arguing that the program has done little more than bring forward vehicle replacements that would have taken place anyway, but at a high cost to the taxpayer. Earlier this month, the Republican senator Jim DeMint said the scheme had been mismanaged, and that it simply amounted to throwing money at people. \"It doesn't make sense to keep rushing through bills, borrowing money from our children and then saying 'Shazam! We've sold some cars!'\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
