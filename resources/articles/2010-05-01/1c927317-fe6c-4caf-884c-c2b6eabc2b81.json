Still, we'll try to rub along. And we can look for a morale boost to the likes of Chris Hyman, boss of the multinational Serco and thus steward of the nightmare that is Yarl's Wood immigration detention centre in Bedfordshire. It hasn't been doing too well recently. There was the fiasco over ill-treatment and hunger strikers. Eleven detainees who claim they suffered \"inhumane and degrading treatment\" are suing. And three doctors who work there are facing investigation by the General Medical Council. But Chris is keeping his spirits up \u2013 and little wonder, given Serco's annual report, which shows his pay package jumped 34% in 2009 to \u00a31,578,682, or about \u00a34,000 a day. More than enough to pay for any additional staff training at Yarl's Wood, you might think, but let's not begrudge him the money. He's earned it. \u2022 What an amazing few days. Politics as high stakes poker. And amazing, you might reflect, how the Tories panicked, and in their desperation held out the offer of a referendum on electoral reform. Only it didn't quite happen like that. For a better explanation of what happened look to Australia, or more accurately, look to the Australian master of the dark arts, Lynton Crosby, who was jetted in to help Michael Howard last time around and more recently took Boris Johnson's ailing mayoral campaign by the scruff and made it successful. Study what happened when the former object of his affections, the rightwing Australian prime minister John Howard, used the promise of a referendum on ditching the Queen to gain the support he needed, to bamboozle his foes and render himself invincible. Give them a referendum, said Lynton. Make the question divisive and complicated. Bear in mind that you are not constitutionally tied to the result anyway. The rest you know. Lynton has a plan. He always does. \u2022 Nick Robinson didn't quite know. Neither did Adam Boulton. But one would have needed the wisdom of Solomon to work out what has really been going on in Westminster. Reader Chris Sturdy points out that reworked, the sentence \"the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats engaged in coalition talks\" emerges as: \"There's a David Cameron/Nick Clegg love-in as total national debt rises.\" And this may tell us something, it may not. But it certainly provided more clarity than Boulton's slanging-match with Alastair Campbell? \u2022 Poor Adam. Tired, angry and now the victim of types with nothing better to do than meddle with his Wikipedia page. No, he never did author a book called Falling of Love: The End of My Marriage to Alastair Campbell. And Simon &amp; Garfunkel is not a publisher. \u2022 It's all complicated. Even the experts are flummoxed. Even Mike Smithson, doyen of the political tipsters, boss of the peerless politicalbetting.com. He lost a pretty penny last week. Swayed perhaps by his allegiance to the Liberal Democrats, and maybe placing hope over experience, he bet that the party would win 81 seats or more. Friday's aftermath was as big a shock to him as to everyone else. \"I don't like losing money,\" he tells us, but then he can afford it and it's all swings and roundabouts. By being the first party leader to fall, Gordon this week swelled the Smithson coffers by more than \u00a3700. The rise of Ed Balls would mean another fine pay day. Smithson isn't often wrong. Yikes. \u2022 Finally: a black Briton, having concluded a business trip in Italy, presents at passport control, Milan airport. The unfriendly official eyes him suspiciously. This is not good. \"Where are you from,\" he demands. \"London,\" replies the traveller. \"No \u2013 where were you born,\" he asks, coldly insistent. London, the traveller says again. \"Oh,\" snorts the official, clearly dissatisfied but shorn of ideas about where to take the conversation next. \"Well, sorry, you can't go through to the gate, you're too early. Come back one hour before flight.\" And having experienced for himself the disdainful treatment meted out to thousands of other minority travellers, a keen-to-get-home Trevor Phillips, born in north London, chair of Britain's equalities watchdog, did just that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
