Shell has given \u00a36m to fund the work of the university\u2019s magnetic resonance research group amid a concerted campaign by students and staff to persuade the university to sever its links with extractive industries. The university was praised earlier this year after its management agreed to provide fully costed plans setting out how it could divest multibillion-pound endowments from fossil fuel corporations. But critics have described the recent donation as a reversal. The Shell donation was approved in March, but details of it were not included among official disclosures in July, when most donations from the last academic year were announced. Details have emerged days before a senior Shell executive is due to address senior university staff on whether Cambridge should continue to accept funding from fossil fuel companies. Sinead Lynch, the chair of Shell UK, has been invited to join the panel at a policy-making workshop on Monday. Environmental campaigners at Cambridge have raised questions about potential links between the donation and the invitation. A spokesperson for Cambridge Zero Carbon said the university had been \u201chijacked\u201d by the fossil fuel industry, which was already earning hundreds of millions off Cambridge research breakthroughs. \u201cFossil fuel executives should be in court for their crimes against humanity, not helping determine the policy of leading public research institutions,\u201d the spokesperson said. The latest funding from Shell was described by the university as \u201cthe final gift in a commitment [dating] back to 2014\u201d to fund the magnetic resonance research group. \u201cThe main focus of Prof [Lynn] Gladden\u2019s proposed research related to the gift is on supporting the transition to a zero-carbon economy by improving chemical reactions in fuel cells, electrolysers and making chemical processes for industrial use more sustainable,\u201d a spokesperson said. However, the Guardian understands that hydrocarbon recovery is also among the areas to be researched with the money. On Gladden\u2019s own page on the Cambridge university website she listed \u201coil recovery\u201d among her research interests. A recent student-led investigation found she was named as the lead inventor on two oil exploration technologies, most recently in January. \u201cMagnetic resonance has long been used in the oil drilling sector as a method for assessing the fluid composition within oil-bearing rocks,\u201d her page on the Cambridge website says. \u201cFor example, we can use [it] to explore how the treatment fluid moves and deposits within the rock so that we can optimise its properties to maximise the oil recovery from the rock, and water retention within the rock, during an extraction process.\u201d Despite the efforts of campaigners, Cambridge in 2017 rejected proposals to fully divest from fossil fuels. At the beginning of the year it was revealed that as university management considered the decision, the institution kept secret offers of multimillion-pound donations from BP and the mining company BHP. Cambridge has denied the money had any bearing on its decision. A spokesperson for the university said that as it accepted the latest funding from Shell, it had called for a \u201cset of principles\u201d by which to assess future donations from companies involved in fossil fuel extraction and other controversial industries. It was on this basis that it had invited Lynch, alongside others, to speak at the university on Monday. \u201cThe university has invited, among others, the student society Cambridge Zero Carbon, Friends of the Earth, climate scientists, Shell, council members and members of the [university\u2019s committee on benefactions and external and legal affairs] to the meeting,\u201d it said. After publication, a university spokesperson said the gift from Shell had not been announced because the paperwork had yet to be completed. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2019 to add further comment from the university spokesperson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
