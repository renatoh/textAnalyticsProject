Pistorius\u2019s family had been expecting his release on Tuesday morning, but late on Monday night his lawyer said the former Paralympian was already at his uncle\u2019s house. He is expected to remain under correctional supervision, or house arrest, until 2019, pending the outcome of an appeal by prosecutors that could yet see him returned to jail. The Pistorius family said in a statement read by spokesperson Anneliese Burgess on Tuesday morning that the athlete was still serving his sentence for Steenkamp\u2019s death. \u201cIt is very important for the family to emphasise that Oscar\u2019s sentence hasn\u2019t been shortened or reduced. He\u2019s simply entering the next phase of his sentence now. He will serve this under the strict conditions that govern correctional supervision. \u201cThe family will support Oscar as he serves out the remainder of the five-year sentence handed down by the trial judge, and he will strictly adhere to the conditions set by the parole board and community corrections.\u201d The Steenkamp family\u2019s spokesperson, Tanya Coen, said: \u201cTo them it does not matter whether he was released yesterday, a few hours earlier or a few hours later, whether he remains incarcerated or not. It makes no difference to their lives because Reeva is still not coming back.\u201d The former athlete was convicted last year of culpable homicide after he shot dead Steenkamp at his house in Pretoria. Pistorius maintained that he had mistaken her for an intruder, and the court accepted his argument that he had not intended to kill her. The state has challenged Judge Thokozile Masipa\u2019s original verdict of culpable homicide, and the supreme court of appeals (SCA) will hear that appeal on 3 November. Prosecutors argue that Pistorius should have been convicted of murder, which carries a minimum sentence of 15 years. Late on Monday night, Pistorius was taken from his cell to the residence of his uncle, Arnold Pistorius, in Waterkloof, an upmarket Pretoria suburb. The house is a three-storey converted Dutch Reformed church on a luxury estate, and has a swimming pool. External security includes four-metre high walls, surveillance cameras and a guard\u2019s hut. By midday on Tuesday there were still at least 50 journalists camped outside the property. An enterprising Pretoria resident had set up a portable barbecue selling boerewors (sausage) rolls at 30 rand a piece. But there was no sign of Pistorius. Manelisi Wolela, a spokesperson for the department of correctional services, confirmed that he had been released at 7.30pm on Monday. The decision to move Pistorius from the prison a day early \u2013 to avoid a media circus on Tuesday morning \u2013 was made by the management of Kgosi Mampuru II prison, the department of correctional services said in a statement. \u201cOscar Pistorius was placed under correctional supervision tonight. The handling of the actual placement is an operational matter of the local management, and how they handle it is their prerogative that is carried out in the best interest of all parties concerned, the victims, the offender and the department of correctional services,\u201d it said. Correctional services minister Michael Masutha had told local broadcaster eNCA that the terms of Pistorius\u2019s release included a requirement to meet with Steenkamp\u2019s parents, if and when they agree to such a meeting. \u201cIt is especially the person who is the source of your pain, who making peace with is likely to bring the greatest healing,\u201d said Masutha. Pistorius will also have to undertake community service and attend regular psychotherapy sessions. According to eNCA journalist Karyn Maughan, lawyers for the Steenkamp family indicated that they were willing to meet with Pistorius, but only \u201cat the right time\u201d and away from the public eye. In June, a parole board told Pistorius he would be released on 20 August, only for this decision to be suspended by the government following public outcry. A judicial review panel subsequently overturned it on a technicality. Pistorius was granted a second parole hearing last week, which set the 20 October release date. Pistorius\u2019s family had been concerned that his parole might be cut short by further legal action. The Pistorius\u2019s early release from prison has been criticised by women\u2019s groups in South Africa, including the ANC Women\u2019s League, who said they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the decision. \u201cWe pin our hopes on the SCA to repeal the judgment and that Oscar must serve a sentence that would bring him back a changed man and an advocate for women\u2019s rights in future,\u201d it said in a statement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
