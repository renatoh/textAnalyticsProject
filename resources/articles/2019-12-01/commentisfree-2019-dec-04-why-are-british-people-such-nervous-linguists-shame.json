Shame", "bodyText": "\u2018No other subject,\u201d says my language teacher, \u201cis the cause of so much shame. You might struggle with other subjects, but you\u2019ll probably never berate yourself like you do about your shortcomings in language learning.\u201d That\u2019s a good point or, as they say in Welsh, mae e\u2019n gwneud pwynt da. I\u2019m learning Welsh because I thought it was about time I did so, having spent so much time there on holiday all my life. It struck me that I wasn\u2019t much different to the kind of expats in Spain I might sniff at for not knowing any Spanish beyond dos cervezas por favor. I felt a kind of shame about this. There we go; it\u2019s that word shame again. And there\u2019s that feeling of self-loathing you get when you know that, at some point, you knew the German word for exhaust pipe but suddenly can\u2019t remember it. I don\u2019t recall this ever happening in maths \u2013 \u201cI used to know what eight times seven was, but now it\u2019s gone\u201d \u2013 or geography \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m so idiotically stupid; I used to know exactly how an oxbow lake was formed, but I\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d I expect many Guardian readers made a resolution earlier this year to learn a new language or \u201cbrush up\u201d their school French. And now, as they are preparing to make the same resolution, they will be feeling a little, yes, ashamed. What is this self-flagellation all about? My Croatian teacher thinks it is a peculiarly British thing. She says you never hear French, German or Spanish speakers berating themselves about how poor their English is. Nor Croats actually \u2013 never have I heard one of my mum\u2019s countryfolk seek forgiveness for grammatical errors, or the word they can\u2019t quite recall. They just crack on, and quite right, too. Perhaps it\u2019s some expression of guilt about our linguistic imperialism. How many times have we been told how hopeless at languages we are as a nation? It\u2019s true, but the message might have sunk in so far that it\u2019s holding us back from rectifying the situation. Being brought up bilingually didn\u2019t seem to help me with other languages at school. With French, I always felt as if I had missed a key lesson early on and never quite caught up. All of a sudden, the teacher was talking about something mysteriously called the \u201cperfect\u201d tense. Eh? Seriously, I couldn\u2019t see what was so special about it. Then came the imperfect tense, which looked no worse than any other tense, as far I could see. As for pluperfect, well, enough was enough. I gave up French and took up German. To my dismay and bewilderment, I was soon presented with something more confusing than even the French had thought up, bizarre things called cases \u2013 nominative, accusative etc. I duly failed my O-level. Now, realising (with shame, naturally) that my Croatian is the standard of a small child\u2019s, I am having Croatian lessons. To my horror, there are seven cases. And now I am hearing all the mistakes I am making, I am too ashamed (sorry to labour the point, but it\u2019s so true) to speak. All fluency has gone. So, all told, I have failed at French, German, Croatian and, while it\u2019s great to be learning a language from scratch with a great teacher, I am sure I will soon be failing at Welsh too. The shame of it. PS. German for exhaust pipe is auspuff, to my mind easily the most delightful word in any language."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
