Official data showed fewer adults have been criminalised for offences involving the supply of cannabis in England and Wales over the past five years, while more under-18s have been. The figures were included in a report on children and illegal drugs by the drug policy campaign group Volteface. It cited figures released by the Ministry of Justice under freedom of information laws showing the number of prosecutions and convictions in both age groups had decreased for possession and cultivation of cannabis between 2012-13 and 2016-17. But in the same period, the number of young people prosecuted for supplying cannabis rose by 14.5% and there was a 25.6% increase in convictions. That compared with a 16.4% fall in the number of prosecutions of adults and a 1.4% increase in convictions for the same crime. In respect of possession with intent to supply cannabis, 5.5% more young people were prosecuted and there was a 5.1% rise in convictions. The number of prosecutions of adults fell by 22.1% and convictions by 10.6%. Steve Moore, the former chief executive of David Cameron\u2019s Big Society Network, said this \u201ccould indicate that more young people are being exploited by adults to deal cannabis on their behalf\u201d. \u201cCuts to young people\u2019s services offering support and intervention, a lack of opportunities, a desire for money and social status, as well as social media easily connecting young people with dealers, have been proposed as reasons that make young people increasingly vulnerable to becoming cannabis dealers,\u201d he said. One of the group\u2019s recommendations was that \u201cdealing cannabis as a young person be considered a potential indicator of vulnerability, rather than criminality, and should be treated as a safeguarding concern, much like in instances of child sexual exploitation\u201d. Earlier this month, the Guardian reported on the trend among some drug dealers in urban areas towards grooming young people and offering them money to sell class A drugs in rural areas, a trade known as \u201ccounty lines\u201d. But Volteface said its research suggested \u201cthis model has not, as it stands, taken hold with cannabis\u201d. The organisation said the people its researchers interviewed reported that \u201cyoung people are being targeted by adult dealers to deal cannabis on their behalf, usually for money, or to get cannabis to smoke, with explicit or implied coercion involved\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
