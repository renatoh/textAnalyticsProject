Fang Fang has been accused of contributing to a negative international narrative on China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The popular Wuhan writer began chronicling the lockdown in late January, including criticism of the official response. \u201cHow many people have died in Wuhan and their families destroyed?\u201d she wrote on 31 January. \u201cBut so far not a single person has said sorry or taken responsibility. I\u2019ve even seen a writer use the phrase \u2018complete victory\u2019. What are they talking about?\u201d Her posts were shared widely on social media even as each was quickly deleted by censors, according to the Diplomat magazine. Her Weibo account, which had more than 3.8 million followers, was shut down in February. It has since been reinstated. But her writing was picked up and turned into a book, due to be published by Harper Collins in June, translated and published in English and German. For publishing in the western languages, Fang Fang has been accused of helping foreign countries attack China, giving them \u201ca giant sword\u201d. China is in the midst of a western media campaign and soft diplomacy push to improve its reputation over its handling of the virus and accusations of underreporting statistics. \u201cWuhan Diary is a knife handed over to foreigners and a bullet shooting at Chinese,\u201d said one poster on Weibo. Another wrote: \u201cThe woman only writes articles in her own small blog, and does not know the overall situation of our country at all. Maybe she does not admit that she is unpatriotic, she thought we were extreme, in fact she was just a stupid old lady.\u201d On Weibo, \u201cFang Fang Diary\u201d has had 380m views, 94,000 discussions, and 8,210 original posts, peaking last week. On Twitter, the hashtag #wuhandiary shows hundreds of critical posts. \u201cThe attack on Fang Fang is so vehement and hateful that it\u2019s scary to watch,\u201d said Li Yuan, a New York Times columnist. \u201cFang Fang herself said that it reminded her of the Cultural Revolution.\u201d On Wednesday, China\u2019s English-language state newspaper said it was \u201cshameful\u201d to see Fang Fang praised in western media that had been dedicated to defaming China\u2019s pandemic response. Citing \u201cobservers\u201d, the editorial said her diary was \u201cbiased and only exposes the dark side in Wuhan while ignoring the efforts that local people made and the support extended across the nation\u201d.
