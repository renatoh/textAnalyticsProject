Opponents, moreover, who have conceded just two home goals this year. The task of defeating Arsenal at the Emirates is a huge one for a Spanish side seeking to match their performance of reaching the Champions League semi-final three years ago. Small wonder that Marcos Senna, whose wonderful goal against Arsenal in the first leg appeared to have given Villareal a foothold in the next round, says his side have \"nothing to lose\". But if that sounds like Villarreal believe they have already lost, think again. \"Arsenal do not scare me,\" insists midfielder Sebasti\u00e1n Eguren. \"I mean it, this game is winnable. We should not be grateful for the first-leg draw, far from it. Arsenal are a young and very strong side, but we should have got more and the performance proved we can beat them. We don't have to convince ourselves: we are already convinced.\" Conviction comes from the experience of the last round when, as against Arsenal, Villarreal drew 1-1 at the Madrigal. They then travelled to Greece, to a hostile arena and a dreadful pitch, and defeated Panathinaikos 2-1. The dust had barely settled on Tuesday night's match when their coach Manuel Pellegrini declared: \"I feel exactly the same now as I did after the first leg in the last round.\" Senna adds: \"We have got 90 minutes left to finish the job. We did it against Panathinaikos so we can do it again.\" Repeating the result means repeating the performance, not chasing the unfamiliar. \"We have to be ourselves, not break from our style,\" says Eguren. \"Everyone knows what we are like. We will play and play and the chances will come. One-one is not a good result, but we can win.\" Senna, too, is upbeat. \"We will play just as we did at home,\" he says, \"moving the ball around. We will not sit back.\" Villareal's is a game based on possession and passing, with little room for the long ball or aggressive tactics. Brute force makes way for precision. On occasion, that can cost them. Villarreal sometimes lack physical presence and a touch of nastiness, frustrating even a coach whose commitment to a technical game is steadfast. After one match, Pellegrini launched into midfielder Cani for not committing the tactical foul that would have preserved victory. Similarly, Robert Pir\u00e8s admitted that the difference in physical intensity between the Premier League and La Liga told on Tuesday. Villarreal could not handle Arsenal's intensity, nor maintain their own. It is that difference, in part, that has seen him reborn in Spain at 35. The shortfall has been felt most away. As Sebastian God\u00edn admits, Villarreal appear \"impossible to analyse\". They defeated Panathinaikos, but what of Almer\u00eda, to whom they lost 3-0 last weekend? Or even Second Division B side Poli Ejido, who beat them 5-0 in the Copa del Rey? Villarreal won in Greece, but have not won an away match in the league since November, during which time they have emerged victorious from just one in 10 matches on their travels. When they reached the semi-final of the 2006 Champions League, they did not win a single away game in the knock-out phase. Last time, Villarreal progressed on the back of their away goals, not their away victories. As they prepare for the Emirates they are far from out \u2013 but this time they must take a different and more difficult route if they are to reach the same destination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
