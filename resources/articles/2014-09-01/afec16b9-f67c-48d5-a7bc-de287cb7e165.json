The 29-year-old midfielder, who has won one France cap, joins the recent loan acquisition Alex Song as well as other summer signings Carl Jenkinson, Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho, Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9, Diego Poyet, Aaron Cresswell and Mauro Z\u00e1rate. Amalfitano said he had spoken to West Ham\u2019s manager, Sam Allardyce, who had \u201cexplained to me how the team plays and how he needs me. I explained to him where I prefer as my position in his team. This is a new team with very good players with great experience of this league. I think everything can go well and I hope we have a good season.\u201d Amalfitano spent last season on loan at West Bromwich Albion, scoring four goals \u2013 including a memorable effort in a 2-1 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford. He added: \u201cI prefer to play behind the striker but last year with West Brom I played on the right. I like to cross the ball too but I can also give through passes from behind the striker. The coach will see what happens in every game and, if he finds another position for me in the team, there is no problem for me. \u201cI enjoyed my first year in English football and for that reason I have come back and hopefully I can improve again. The first year was good for my experience and I will try to help West Ham now by giving my best and continue to improve in this league. I like this country and this is the best league.\u201d Mohamed Diam\u00e9, meanwhile, has left West Ham to join Hull City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
