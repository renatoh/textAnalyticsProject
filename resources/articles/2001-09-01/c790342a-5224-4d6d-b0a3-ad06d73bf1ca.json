Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has published new operational requirements for military latrines after a top-to-bottom review concluded that current models are no longer acceptable for all situations in which US forces may find themselves. The multimillion-dollar procurement programme echoes the excesses of the Ronald Reagan era, notably a $600 airborne toilet seat the generals of that era ordered. Supporters argued that it was not just a seat but an entire system, able to withstand G forces and sudden decompression that had been intensively tested under diarrhoea and combat conditions. In published papers heavy with codewords for new potty contraptions to ensure the safe completion of the most basic of human functions, the Pentagon is now looking at a number of different models. The most sophisticated is the air transportable Collectively Protected Expeditionary Latrine, or CPEL. Even in the face of chemical and biological attack, CPEL is a safe place to go. It is designed to operate in 'remote austere locations'. As well as being self-contained and self-pressurised, the military's mini superloo comes with its own waste tank. Until now, troops facing the call of nature, even under attack, have had to do their business the old-fashioned way with a shovel. According to Colonel Talbot Vivian of the Air Force, CPEL is a significant advance 'We've spent a lot of time and brain bytes to think this through,' Vivian says. Although it is not known what percentage of the US's $206 billion defence budget is earmarked for the new loos, and it will hardly rival the billions being poured into the Son of Star Wars missile defence shield, military men are already on the defensive over jokes about their need for a safe place to go. An article in the Washington Post that made fun of CPEL elicited angry letters from supporters of the new thunder box. 'Surely we should not expect our airmen to leave a protected environment, don a protective suit, go to an outdoor toilet, remove the suit to use the toilet, and risk exposure,' wrote a retired Army officer, Lt-Col H. Eric Watkins. 'How to deal with the elimination of human waste in a chem-bio environment is a serious problem deserving serious review.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
