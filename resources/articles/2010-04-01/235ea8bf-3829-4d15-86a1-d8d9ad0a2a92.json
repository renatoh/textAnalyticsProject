Although the Arsenal manager's record has been very strong despite the financial constraints imposed by the construction of the Emirates Stadium, he is now believed to command comfortably the third-biggest wage bill in the Premier League. According to analysis by the Arsenal Supporters Trust of the club's accounts released last November, the Gunners' wage commitments have risen to around \u00a3120m. By contrast Chelsea's were swollen by \u00a312.6m in compensation payments to the two most recently departed managers, Avram Grant and Luiz Felipe Scolari. Strip those out and Chelsea's total is, according to their most recently available accounts, a very comparable \u00a3137m. Sure, Arsenal's is all self-generated income rather than owner subsidy. But to add some context to Carlo Ancelotti's competitive advantage over Wenger, Arsenal's wage bill exceeds the total annual 2007-08 revenues of all Premier League clubs except Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, according to figures compiled by Deloitte. Meanwhile it is believed Wenger's transfer budget this summer will be subsidised not by any shareholder contributions but through the success of the stadium redevelopment. As recently as last summer Alisher Usmanov's partner, Farhad Moshiri, was complaining the project could undermine Arsenal. But it is believed that by the time the transfer window opens all the club's debts associated with it will have been paid off, ensuring that the tens of millions Wenger has at his disposal can be spent on transfer fees and wages. Chiles starts a ripple The defection of Adrian Chiles, below, to ITV has set tongues wagging at his old employer. Many at the Beeb had suspected ITV would take advantage of the unpopular relocation of the sports department to make an offer to Gary Lineker \u2013 one that would guarantee he could stay in London. Lineker and the ITV head of sport, Niall Sloane, have been close friends since their shared time at Match of the Day. Instead, in a move ordered by the ITV's director of television, Peter Fincham, Chiles moves to take over a broad portfolio including fronting the channel's World Cup coverage and anchoring the revamped GMTV. Sloane has already had a strong influence on Chiles's career, having been responsible for the former business journalist's move into sports coverage at Football Focus, then Match of the Day 2. But the switch has rather upset the World Cup plans of Sloane, who had expected Steve Rider to present the coverage from South Africa. ITV says it is in talks to beef up Rider's presence elsewhere but now Auntie's gossips anticipate Rider will return to his alma mater to front the golf coverage and play a key role in broadcasting the 2012 Olympic Games. A charitable wage The Youth Sport Trust, a registered charity that raises about 90% of its income from public funds, is advertising for a \u00a370,000-a-year director of communications. The successful applicant would become the seventh YST employee on more than \u00a360,000 a year. But he or she should perhaps beware of cross-party plans to cull spending on NGOs and quangoes. Lapthorne's legacy The departure of Sir Richard Lapthorne from McLaren has clearly not disadvantaged the Formula One team from a sporting point of view, after Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton provided the constructor a Shanghai grand prix one-two on Sunday. Of course he has sought no credit for the one-two finish in Shanghai but the suggestion in his resignation statement that his \"work is done\" after precisely a year in post seemed odd. Lapthorne replaced the embattled Ron Dennis when the man who had micromanaged McLaren for decades stepped down from any sports involvement. During Dennis's time in charge a $100m fine over \"Spygate\" and a corrosive spat with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile through the Formula One Teams Association exposed the fissures in McLaren's relationship with the sport's authorities. But the team has breathed a collective sigh of relief at the period of relative serenity under the chairmanship of his friend \u2013 who despite the undeniable glamour of the role is understood to prefer gardening to motorsport \u2013 and there is confidence the problems of a turbulent past will not return."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
