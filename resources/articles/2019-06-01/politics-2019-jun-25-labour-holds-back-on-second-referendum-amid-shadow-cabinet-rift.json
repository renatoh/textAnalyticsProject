Corbyn is understood to have told shadow cabinet ministers there would be further consultation with the unions and a decision on the next step taken in the coming weeks, to the frustration of several present including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Sources in the room said McDonnell had said he was \u201cunder the impression we were making the decision today\u201d on how to advance Labour\u2019s position. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, also questioned why a decision was not being taken and said it was \u201cabout showing leadership\u201d. Several shadow cabinet members emerged from last week\u2019s meeting believing the party would agree a new strategy on Tuesday, after Corbyn had consulted trade union leaders. \u201cBasically Unite stepped in yesterday and put the brakes on,\u201d one shadow cabinet source said. McDonnell \u201cis obviously trying to push us forward but LOTO [the leader\u2019s team] are pushing back\u201d. Speaking at a car industry conference on Tuesday, McDonnell was asked directly if the Labour party was campaigning for a second referendum, replying: \u201cWell, I\u2019m arguing the case \u2026 The discussion we are having in the Labour party now, and it is no secret, is what would our attitude be if there is a referendum?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve said personally, I\u2019d vote for remain. I campaigned for remain because I can\u2019t see anything better than what we have got at the moment. I can see the consequences in terms of jobs and living standards.\u201d McDonnell said the party\u2019s policy would \u201cevolve over the next week or so because there are more party consultations\u201d. Phil Wilson, a backer of the People\u2019s Vote campaign who has co-led attempts in parliament to put any Brexit deal to a referendum, said the delay was damaging the party. \u201cLabour members and Labour MPs expect our party to have a clear policy that reflects our values,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we have to listen to muddle, confusion and the sound of the can being kicked listlessly down a never-ending road. The longer this dithering goes on, the more damage will be done to our party.\u201d The shadow cabinet rift comes amid concerns about a summer of potential selection battles after MPs were given a fortnight to decide whether they wished to stand again for parliament \u2013 a sign that the party is preparing for a snap election. MPs suggested it could make the party impossible to manage, with frontbenchers among those expressing concern they could be deselected. \u201cWe could end up in a situation where frontbench Labour MPs are deselected and have to serve for another three years knowing they will have to go at the next election,\u201d one MP said. \u201cHow does that serve the party or help departmental teams develop a manifesto? How can whips manage a party where 20 MPs may have been deselected? Either senior Labour people know this and don\u2019t care or they don\u2019t realise. That is very worrying.\u201d MPs expressed anger at the timetable at a private meeting of Labour MPs on Monday night. The chair of the parliamentary Labour party, Jon Cryer, told the meeting it was a \u201crushed job\u201d to give MPs only two weeks to decide whether to stand again when they would normally be notified well in advance. Many MPs have also questioned the need for such a short timeframe, with several contrasting it with the leadership\u2019s apparent unwillingness to ballot members on a change of Brexit policy, as proposed by the deputy leader, Tom Watson. \u201cIt\u2019s striking that, in this time of political chaos, our leadership can\u2019t agree to give members a ballot on Brexit and what our policy should be, but can make time to push for them to happen on deselections of MPs \u2013 I know which I would rather be fighting,\u201d one MP said. Party rules were changed in September to make it easier for a local party to \u201ctrigger\u201d a selection contest, rather than automatically re-adopting the sitting MP. Several MPs said they had already begun the groundwork preparing for trigger ballots, but warned that reselection battles would take huge amounts of time and energy. \u201cThis is money and time that could go into holding my marginal seat at snap election,\u201d one MP said. Another called the new procedure \u201ca massive distraction\u201d. The flashpoints where party sources said MPs are most at risk of selection battles include Thangam Debbonaire\u2019s seat in Bristol West and a number of seats around Merseyside and the north-west, including the seats of Maria and Angela Eagle and Louise Ellman. Roger Godsiff, the MP who has defended parents\u2019 rights to take their children out of LGBT-inclusive lessons, and Kate Hoey, who has voted consistently with hard Brexiters in parliament, could also face local difficulty if they decide to stand again. It is unclear what would be the fate of two Labour MPs who are suspended from the party and are under investigation \u2013 Chris Williamson and Kelvin Hopkins. When the snap election was called in 2017, the suspended Labour MP Simon Danczuk was deselected. At least two Labour MPs who have previously rebelled to back efforts to deliver Brexit, Jim Fitzpatrick and Ronnie Campbell, have already announced they will not seek re-election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
