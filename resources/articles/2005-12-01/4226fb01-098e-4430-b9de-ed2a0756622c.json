The figure is the most the UN has ever asked for in its initial appeal at the start of the year. The 2006 humanitarian appeal will cover 31 million people, mainly in Africa and south-east Asia. The UN said it is the equivalent of 48 hours of global military spending, or the cost of two cups of coffee for the world's billion richest people. \"In a world of plenty, continued suffering is a terrible stain on our conscience,\" said the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan. \"It is inexcusable that we not strive, with every resource at our disposal, to eliminate suffering.\" Countries covered include African nations that have long been in crisis, including Chad, Congo, Liberia, Somalia, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Also on the list are Chechnya, the Palestinian territories, Colombia and Nepal. The $1.5bn sought for Sudan reflects the grave nature of the problem in Darfur, where humanitarian work is threatened by continued clashes between government-backed Arab militias and rebel groups, said Jan Egeland, the UN's humanitarian relief coordinator. \"It's not going well in Darfur at all,\" he said. \"We are stretched to the limit. We're hanging in there by our fingernails.\" Donors around the world met just 57% of last year's worldwide appeal, which started out at $1.7bn and focused on forgotten crises. The appeal shot up to $5.9bn after the Indian Ocean tsunami and other disasters including the Kashmir earthquake, but not all the money has been given. Mr Egeland said one of the main problems was that 90% of aid came from 10 countries - including the US, Japan and European nations - while oil producing nations in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East continued to eschew the appeals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
