When you buy one, the charity Cycle of Good, which is based in Stoke-on-Trent, donates another one to its social enterprise in Malawi. It\u2019s an ethical version of bogof: you buy one, they give one free! We all ride bikes to feel better. It\u2019s well known cycling is a tonic to both our physical and mental wellbeing. But in Malawi a bike has the power to really transform lives \u2013 whether in helping children get to schools that are often miles away or farmers to transport heavy produce to market. Purchasing an Elephant bike also comes with an almost unique customer benefit: you will never suffer buyer\u2019s remorse. The bikes are also a brilliant example of purposeful \u2018up-cycling\u2019. All the frames are refurbished British postal bikes that have been saved from landfill. Their dark green paint job covers up the old red and white of the postie\u2019s favourite. The steel frame comes in two sizes and it\u2019s practically indestructible: yours will cope easily with a daily commute or shopping trip; while its African twin, living a parallel life, will have no trouble hauling 20kg loads on rutted roads. And you be assured that both deliver a first-class ride. Cool kit Get a grip in breathable gloves with a 4mm padded gel palm to soak up road vibrations on even the roughest surfaces. The adjustable cuff makes for a snug fit, while sewn-in finger-pulls means it\u2019s easy to take the gloves off after a long day\u2019s ride. A silicone palm print also means you can keep great contact with your bars in all weathers. No one ever wants to fall off a bike, but even a pair of light mitts give you a surprising amount of protection if you do hit the tarmac. Never ride without them. dhb Aeron gel gloves, \u00a315, wiggle.co.uk Email Martin at martin.love@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
