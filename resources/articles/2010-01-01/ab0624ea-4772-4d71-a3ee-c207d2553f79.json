In a hardening of the Tory position on tax, after criticism that the party is offering vague aspirations, Cameron promised to set out his position on national insurance long before the general election. \"Yes, way before election day,\" Cameron said on BBC Radio 5 Live when he was asked whether he would be able to give a clear commitment on national insurance. There is due to be a 1% increase on both employers and employees in April 2011. Cameron added: \"Look, it is not a great idea to put up taxes on people, \u00a320,000 or \u00a330,000, which is what Labour are planning to do in 2011. So we are looking as hard as we can at public spending programmes and trying to see if we can avoid at least a part of this great big tax rise on middle Britain and on jobs at precisely the time when we should be trying to help people to get jobs.\" Cameron's remarks, a month after the shadow chancellor George Osborne issued a \"very clear statement of intent\" that he would resist introducing the NICs increase, was the strongest indication to date that the Tories would have a clear tax-cutting pledge by the time of the election. His claim that the Tories would try and avoid \"at least part\" of the tax increase will fuel speculation that Cameron might exempt employers, but not employees, from the increase. Cameron, who admitted last week that he \"messed up\" on tax when he issued contradictory statements on recognising marriage, was careful to say that he would be acting cautiously. \"The situation the country faces is so bad that I have got to find the money, I've got to find the savings before I can make the promise. If I can find the savings I will make the promise. If I can't I won't. It's as simple and straightforward as that.\" Labour regarded Cameron's remarks yesterday as a milder replay of his self-confessed mistake last week on recognising marriage in the tax system. Liam Byrne, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Yet another slippery interview shows an emerging problem with David Cameron. He's pursuing a deliberate strategy of 'nods and winks', using words like 'policy', 'commitment' and 'aspiration', interchangably. \"He needs to come clean with people on national insurance, married couples allowance and the rest of his \u00a334bn of unfunded promises: what is now a real promise and what's just empty words? Its clear, David Cameron really can't go on like this.\" Tory sources insisted yesterday that there was no change in the party's position on national insurance. George Osborne indicated last month that the Tories would reverse the increase before its planned introduction in 2011. \"I am giving you a very clear statement of intent,\" the shadow chancellor told the Times. \"The no 1 priority is to try to avoid bringing it in. That is something you can judge us on between now and 2011.\" The new stance came as Cameron said he accepted that it was too simplistic to suggest that changing the tax system, by recognising marriage, would immediately improve family life. But in a speech to the Demos thinktank, he said it was important to send a message about the importance of families by, for example, extending the right to request flexible working to all parents with children under 18. Cameron added: \"What matters most to a child's life chances is not the wealth of their upbringing but the warmth of their parenting. Of course there's a link between material poverty and poor life chances, but the full picture is that that link also runs through the style of parenting that children in poor households receive.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
