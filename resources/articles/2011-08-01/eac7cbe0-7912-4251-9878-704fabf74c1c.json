One is the devastating attack on demagogic journalism, Sweet Smell of Success (1957), the other his neglected version of Richard Hughes's 1929 novel, A High Wind in Jamaica, a book that anticipated Lord of the Flies. Superficially an exciting nautical adventure yarn, the subtle, psychological fable centres on a party of Victorian children, captured by Caribbean pirates on their way to England, who send their accidental captors to the gallows. Its real theme is a continuing preoccupation of Mackendrick's, the idea of innocence as a destructive force rather than a simple virtue, and the children come over as merciless, unaccountable subversives. As the chief pirates, Anthony Quinn and James Coburn head an excellent cast. Douglas Slocombe's widescreen photography is first class. The haunting score is by Larry Adler with lyrics bythe poet Christopher Logue. The distinguished playwrights Denis Cannan and Ronald Harwood collaborated on the script."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
