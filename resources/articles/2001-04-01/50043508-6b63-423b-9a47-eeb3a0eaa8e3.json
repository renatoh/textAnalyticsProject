For rest assured Keane would get up again and, having recovered, he would take his revenge. He might take his time over it. He might let you sweat for a number of years, the two dates when your side had to play against him marked with a red cross on the kitchen calendar. But the day would eventually come - as it did for Haaland. After four years and 85 minutes of last weekend's game Keane did unto his adversary what he had intended to do all along. And just to make sure that everyone was absolutely clear whathad been done, he then stood over the prone victim and said the same words that Haaland said to him. Keane's assault bore similarities to a mafia hit. It was a very public warning to all that you do not mess with the main man. A reminder, if it be needed, that Keane will retaliate and should anyone be foolish enough to enter into a cycle of violence with him he will have the final word. So it was not entirely surprising that Keane did not apologise for the dreadful tackle. One suspects he says sorry rarely, if at all. And he certainly wasn't going to start by putting on a fake show of remorse for something that was so clearly premeditated. Nor was his capo, Sir Alex Ferguson, going to wade in and do the apologising for him. He responded in the time-honoured fashion by saying he had seen nothing. And if the questioning had continued he would have called in his lawyers. Thus it is that an assault that should have been met with a hefty punishment, a period of contrition from Keane, and a diminution in Keane's power base has instead led to a consolidation of his position. Ferguson will publicly criticise Beckham for missing training to stay at home with baybee but he won't say a word against the golden boy. Ferguson knows that Keane is the best midfielder in Europe. Ferguson is aware that the only season they failed to win the Premiership recently was the one that Keane missed because of the injury after his tangle with Haaland. Ferguson is certain that the only player he needs above all others for a successful final season is Keane. He would be prepared to let Giggs, Beckham or Cole go; at a stretch, let all three go, as long as Keane stayed. He is the numero uno , without whom the others can't parade their fancy tricks and fluent touches. And now Keane knows how strong his position is. He is first among equals and quite happy to start slagging off his inferiors. In the past week he has called them complacent, criticised them for their weakness for celebrity and their showbiz lifestyles, and claimed that P45s are on their way. In response, an unnamed team-mate was quoted as saying: 'The lads were livid. It is like Roy has become a law unto himself, they were all talking about it at breakfast.' Ooh er, missus. Keane must be terrified. All of them, drinking their lattes, reading OK! and saying: 'I'm livid I am.' And did any of them say it to his face? Would you? He has good grounds for his frustration. For long periods of the game in Munich he was carrying the whole team. He was desperate to prove that they could beat Bayern with him in the team. He was desperate to win a European Cup Final. And his team-mates let him down. And if they do that some of them will have to go. No argument. No debate. Europe is the priority. And after they have won the European Cup again in Keane's perfect world the Republic of Ireland would meet England in the 2002 World Cup Final. Keane v Beckham, Keane v Scholes, Keane v Butt, Keane v Cole, Keane v G Neville, Keane v P Neville. He would take them all on one after the other and consecutively like a chess grandmaster moving from table to table to squish inferior opponents. And the frightening thing is that he would probably win. He has been the pre-eminent footballer in the English League for the past decade, the only one to play for arguably the two best managers of all-time, Ferguson and Brian Clough. And one sideline of the Haaland incident and the internal spat that followed it has been Cloughie wading in to rollock Ferguson for not keeping Keane under control and creating the problem by his lenient approach to past offences. Perhaps so. But Cloughie didn't spend much time publicly slagging off Kenny Burns or whoever else was entrusted with the role of enforcer. Clough, of all people, knows Keane's value. And he knows even better that it is in his best interest to stir the unrest, because if Ferguson wins the European Cup again, he will have fair claim to have been an even greater manager than Clough. And the only way that can happen is if Keane is in his team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
