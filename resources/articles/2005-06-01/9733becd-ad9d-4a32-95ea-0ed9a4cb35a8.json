If you're among the many thousands planning to attend an event this summer, the chances are you've already spent around \u00a3200 on tickets, transport and kitting yourself out for a weekend in a field. And you will spend more when you get there, but there are ways to limit the damage to your wallet. Shopping around According to the Glastonbury organisers, \u00a325 a day should be enough to keep you fed and watered, if you shop around. Food and drink is cheapest in the outer fields, so you may have to leave the main action to keep costs down. Take big bottles of water and snacks, as they are cheap in the outside world but can eat through your cash inside the festival gates. Even if you arrive at the festival determined to stick to a budget, you may be tempted to make an unexpected purchase. It's wise to give yourself a little extra for unforeseen expenses, as well as making sure you've enough money to get home. A festival is predominantly a cash society so don't rely on plastic. All of the big festivals have 24-hour ATMs on site, but most charge a fee. All ATMs at the Leeds and Reading festivals will charge \u00a32. At Glastonbury there will be 10 ATMs dispensing cash, four offered by NatWest and six by Cardpoint. Cardpoint's machines will charge \u00a31.50 a transaction, but NatWest's machines will be free. Matt Howarth of Cardpoint says the fee reflects the huge cost of providing the machines. \"It's hideously expensive to run these ATMS - we've got three chaps on board for security and we have to pay their wages, we have a generator on the truck and there is a satellite link up,\" he says. Evidently, the cost doesn't put people off - at last year's Glastonbury festival each of the six machines registered around 800 transactions a day, netting the company a daily \u00a37,200 in the process. You will face a sizeable queue to use the free NatWest machines. Last year the five days of Glastonbury saw 15,000 transactions - two transactions a minute. And the same will be true at other festivals - the organisers of the Leeds festival plan to have just 12 ATMs on site, for over 50,000 festival-goers. NatWest will also have three mobile banks at Glastonbury, two for the public and one for festival traders. These will open to everyone between 9am and 6pm and will allow you to cash cheques free of charge, whoever you bank with - so take your cheque book and guarantee card. Some of the festival traders will also cash cheques or give cash advances using credit and debit cards. They will charge for this and the fees could be high, so if you do need to do this shop around for the best deal. You will save money if you plan ahead. The Reading festival is close to the centre of town, so it may be worth leaving the site to visit a fee-free ATM. At other events, you may have to choose between arriving with a large sum of cash, or paying to access your money. Do keep an eye on your cash. It's probably best to carry it with you, but don't worry too much, festivals are relatively safe. According to Avon and Somerset police, last year at Glastonbury fewer than 10 thefts were reported. \"People tend to lose money rather than have it nicked,\" says Jason Holmes, one of the festival organisers. The big festivals have a large police presence alongside private security guards, and organisers are keen to keep crime down. However, police spokesman Dan Mountain says it's important for festival-goers not to be complacent about cash or other possessions. \"It's a question of being aware of your surroundings and of being careful how you carry your cash. Think about wearing a secure bum bag or maybe put your money in the pocket in the front of your clothes, rather than the back.\" He adds: \"You need to remember that tents aren't secure. Anything you leave in a tent will be a target for an opportunistic thief. Putting a padlock on a tent won't make a difference - it can just be ripped off.\" Bradford &amp; Bingley estimates that festival-goers could each be taking \u00a31,100 worth of property onto the site, much of which will be left unattended all day. Jason Holmes says the best advice for those going to this year's events is to leave valuables at home. \"Don't bring it if you can't afford to lose it,\" he says. He suggests taking a disposable camera rather than a valuable one and leaving all gadgets but your mobile phone at home. You could further reduce potential losses by taking cheap camping equipment. Bradford &amp; Bingley suggests festival goers may be carrying \u00a3130 tents and \u00a350 sleeping bags, while Asda and Woolworth's offer these items for under \u00a310 each. Rather than risk having \u00a3200 of arctic-expedition kit crushed under the foot of a drunken teenager, consider buying things you won't be too upset to lose. Possessions may be covered by home and contents insurance or, for students, parents' policies. Often these include cover for up to \u00a32,500 worth of personal possessions outside the home. Check this before you leave and, if you don't have cover, consider adding it. It may cost only a few pounds for instant cover over the phone. However, Richard Mason, director of comparison site Insuresupermarket.com, cautions against making a claim on anything worth less than \u00a3500 as premiums will be increased on renewal. \"You will find anything under \u00a3500 is not cost-effective over the next three years,\" he says. \"You will end up paying it back and then some as the insurer attempts to claw back its money.\" At Glastonbury there are some secure lock-ups where you can leave important items if you do need to take them with you. There are 12 of these 24-hour sites around the site manned by CND volunteers. However, the advice to all festival-goers seems to be to travel light - you'll have a better time if you leave your iPod at home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
