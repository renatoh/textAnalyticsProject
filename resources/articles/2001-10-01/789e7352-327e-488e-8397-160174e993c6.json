Shovel them under and let me work - I am the grass; I cover all. And pile them high at Gettysburg And pile them high at Ypres and Verdun. Shovel them under and let me work. Two years, ten years, and passengers ask the conductor: What place is this? Where are we now? I am the grass. Let me work. As founder and co-editor of the Poems on the Underground poster series, I had a call from London Underground who were uneasy about a poem scheduled for display in Tube trains in October and November. In the context of the recent terrorist attacks, there was a feeling that passengers might take offence. Did we want to reconsider? The poem was Grass by Carl Sandburg, a protest against the carnage of war, once a staple anthology piece in schools across America. We had chosen it to mark Remembrance Day; in previous years we've displayed Owen's Anthem For Doomed Youth and Sassoon's Everyone Sang, poems as well-loved in Britain as Grass is in America. I defended the importance of poetry as witness to the times; the best poetry, I suggested, records catastrophe but also offers consolation. Then I re-read Grass, in the bold type of the poster: It seemed clear that we couldn't have it on the Tube. It was too close to TV images of bodies falling from the twin towers, the knowledge that thousands were incinerated. With bio-terrorism no longer a remote fantasy, travellers underground feel especially vulnerable. We phoned back the next day and asked for the poem to be pulled. Yet poetry has a unique power to particularize and contain horror. At spontaneous memorial services in New York, people recited W.H. Auden's September 1st, 1939 (a poem Auden withdrew from his Collected Poems after his politics shifted to the right): \"Waves of anger and fear / Circulate over the bright / And darkened lands of the earth, / Obsessing our private lives; / The unmentionable odour of death / Offends the September night...\" Grass was published in 1918, when the slaughter at Ypres and Verdun was as fresh to readers as the New York massacre is to us. At Verdun there were 362,000 French and 337,000 German casualties; at Ypres a quarter of a million died on each side. Though its references are European, Sandburg's poem is distinctively American in its rhythm and language. I can imagine generations of American schoolteachers explaining to youngsters just who was fighting at Austerlitz and Waterloo and why, how many were killed at Gettysburg and exactly what that terrible battle accomplished or failed to accomplish. Later in the century teachers had a choice of examples: the London blitz, the fire-bombing of Dresden, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and now the World Trade Centre - all signifying the horrific slaughter of one group of human beings by another, on orders from above. I hope the poem will go on display in November, for Sandburg represents a strand of American letters which should be part of our dialogue with other cultures- socialist, progressive, internationalist. Populist 20th-century writers in America offered a savage indictment of corporate America's ruthless drive for power and profit. Upton Sinclair, John Steinbeck, Richard Wright, Langston Hughes, Lillian Hellman, Arthur Miller, were hugely popular with a mass audience. Their writings seem almost dated now, because the blazing anger of these home-grown social critics is mixed with love for the country and its people, and confidence in its future. Especially at this time, it seems right to look again at Sandburg's portrayal of a society which, with all its faults, seemed once to offer unique possibilities for realising the best in human nature. \u00b7 The Tenth Edition of Poems on the Underground, containing over 300 poems displayed on the Tube since 1986, is published by Cassell in November at \u00a314.99"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
