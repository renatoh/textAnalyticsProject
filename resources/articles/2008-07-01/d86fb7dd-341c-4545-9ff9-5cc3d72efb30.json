You won't see the BDG at Dortmund, Morelia-Linares or any of the elite tournaments, but it has a devoted following at club level and on various internet sites. The BDG is unusual in that it is a genuine 1 d4 gambit and for that reason alone it can come as an unpleasant surprise to Black. After 1... d5, Black is likely to be expecting the game to continue along quieter, positional lines. But now White takes the game into tactical and open territory with 2 e4 (incidentally, this position can also arise after a centre counter; after 1 e4 d5, there is nothing to stop White from playing 2 d4). After 2... dxe4 3 Nc3 (the immediate 3 f3, as favoured by the gambit's 19th-century originator Armand Blackmar can be met by 3...e5!) 3... Nf6 4 f3 we have reached the BDG starting position. This was the preferred move order of a relatively weak German player, Emil Josef Diemer, who became possessed by the gambit in the 1940s and spent the rest of his life doggedly espousing its virtues. From here, it is surprisingly easy to go wrong. The first time I encountered the BDG at the Guardian chess club, I took on f3. This is fine, but you do have to know what you're doing. I didn't, and while my opponent developed quickly and aggressively I made the common error of so many who accept gambit pawns and threw everything into maintaining my material advantage. In the diagram, Black has also gone badly wrong. The position was reached after 4... exf3 5 Nxf3 c5 6 d5 e6 7 Bg5 h6 8 Bxf6 gxf6 9 Bb5+ Bd7 10 dxe6 fxe6. White now played 11 Ne5, and after 11... fxe5 12 Qh5+ Ke7 13 0-0 Qe8 14 Qxe5 Bxb5 15 Nd5+ Black resigned. There's not much literature on the BDG. John Cox has a short and dismissive chapter in Dealing with d4 Deviations (Everyman Chess), and while Gary Lane's out-of-print Blackmar-Diemer Gambit (Batsford) makes more of an effort to sell the opening, it's hard to escape the conclusion that the BDG is a pretty risky undertaking. chess@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
