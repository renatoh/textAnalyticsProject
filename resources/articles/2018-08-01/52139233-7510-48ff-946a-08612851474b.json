The midfielder is Arsenal\u2019s longest-serving player but did not start against Chelsea last weekend amid reports he is unable to agree terms on a contract. Ramsey is in the last year of his deal but Emery called on him to put such matters to one side in order to help the team. \u201cI spoke with him last week,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI said: \u2018I want you focused only on training and only on the match, you show us the capacity to help the team.\u2019 The contract is another thing for his agent and the club but we want and I need his focus only on training, only on the match and on his performance each day.\u201d Emery suggested Ramsey\u2019s absence against Chelsea was tactical but the 27-year-old could play against West Ham on Saturday. \u201cChelsea are different to other teams,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to work very specifically to prepare for them. \u201cSaturday is also a difficult match but we are thinking more we can control the match with our personality. Against Chelsea and Manchester City we wanted to but there were more times in the 90 minutes that the opposition didn\u2019t let us.\u201d Emery, who joined Arsenal after leaving Paris Saint-Germain, has endured a bumpy start, losing both Premier League matches. The Spaniard\u2019s plan to implement a possession-based game that builds from the back has met with criticism and he believes a positive result on Saturday is important for the team\u2019s development. \u201cWe need to win this match against West Ham. I think it\u2019s very important to show [the supporters] a better performance than in the two first matches. We are preparing well. I am feeling well when I look at the players in training.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
