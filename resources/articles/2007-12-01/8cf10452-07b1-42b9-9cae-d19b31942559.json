Instead, staff at Healey Primary, Rochdale, told parents of pupils aged five to seven they should send one card, addressed to the whole class, to avoid upset. They claimed some children can be left with hurt feelings if they are missed off Christmas card lists. The school sent out a note after some parents asked teachers for a list of pupils in their children's class - a request they refused, saying it was against data protection laws. A spokesman for the school said that giving out cards wasted valuable teaching time and they have plenty of other Christmas activities planned. The note said: 'Please could parents send just one Christmas card to the whole class rather than asking school for a whole class name list. This is to avoid tears and tantrums which often occur when Christmas cards are distributed.' One parent said: 'For small children, sending cards is a big part of Christmas. It should be a lovely time for them, but this makes me think the spirit of Christmas has gone.' A school spokesman said: 'The cost of so many cards is prohibitive for some families and we feel that children are often pressurised to act in the same way as their peers. 'Some children are missed out and feel very upset when this happens.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
