The production team behind the hit programme are looking at how best to support individuals, with a particular focus on how to deal with their instant social media fame. Thalassitis\u2019s death, which followed the suicides last year of the Love Island contestant Sophie Gradon and her boyfriend, prompted the mental health minister to call on ITV and the show\u2019s production company to ensure it was supporting participants after they left the programme. \u201cWhen someone suddenly goes into the public eye, they then become this personality and they have to continue to promote themselves using social media, the normal broadcast channels and, of course, print media,\u201d the health minister, Jackie Doyle-Price, told BBC 5 Live. \u201cAll of a sudden, they\u2019re living their life in the public eye. And what we\u2019re finding with social media is, people will troll them and attack them, just because they can.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, told a summit in London on Monday that reality TV shows had a duty of care for contestants when they became famous. In an article for the Guardian, the former Love Island contestant Jonny Mitchell wrote that while the programme rook care of contestants while on the show, they were \u201cleft to their own devices to deal with [their baptism of fire] when the sun sets on the season\u201d. \u201cThe young people going into that environment are shot to fame literally overnight, then they are cut loose to handle all alone what\u2019s waiting for them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere needs to be a compulsory aftercare scheme in place for people who are now suffering just so they could make a good TV show.\u201d ITV insists it provides contestants with support before and after the programme, including giving contact numbers for senior members of the production staff and directing contestants on how to find agents to assist with their post-show careers. Love Island has become a cultural phenomenon and a major commercial success for ITV in recent years, luring in younger viewers, who are increasingly hard for traditional TV channels to reach. However, it has faced sustained criticism from former contestants on the level of support it provides. Several TV producers said that Love Island had a reputation within the industry for having an unusually rigorous screening process compared with some reality TV rivals. Production staff laid out the risks and pitfalls of taking part in the programme and weeded out many potential candidates for mental health reasons. But they said little could prepare a twenty-something contestant for the mental strain of leaving a sealed-off environment after several months to discover they were suddenly a household name with millions of followers on Instagram and a public reputation partly constructed by the show\u2019s editors. \u201cThese people are under the microscope that nobody since the early series of Big Brother really has been,\u201d said Willard Foxton, a development producer at an independent production company, who has seen how other reality TV shows are made. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can be prepared for the world of instant fame. Nobody prepares them for that moment when they\u2019re working out of a corner shop three months after the show finishes and a photographer snaps them and someone sends them the headline: \u2018Love Island hunk out of shape eating Double Deckers.\u2019\u201d An ITV spokesperson said: \u201cCare for our Islanders is a process the show takes very seriously and is a continuous process for all those taking part in the show. We ensure that all of our contributors are able to access psychological support before, during and after appearing on the show. \u201cThe programme will always provide ongoing support when needed and where appropriate. We also discuss at length with all of our Islanders, before and after the show, how their lives might change and they have access to support and advice to help with this.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.
