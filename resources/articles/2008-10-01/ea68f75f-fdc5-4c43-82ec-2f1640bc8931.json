Without any concrete proof what should be their next step? The problem A member of my team sometimes takes long lunches. Not much longer than everyone else ... I would probably let it go except for the fact that when he returns to his desk he is not himself. He is less alert than in the morning and slurs his words. I'm sure he has been drinking but I can't prove it. What should my next move be? The worker's view I would test the waters a bit by organising a few meetings or lunches over the time that this person would normally take a break. If their behaviour stays the same or gets worse then I would have to use the direct approach and in a one-to-one chat (out for lunch perhaps) ask them if they have any problems. Next up, you would need to let them know that you think their work suffers in the afternoons and ask them if they are able to identify why. Until things improve you'll be scheduling weekly catch up meetings \u2026 directly after lunchtime. Hopefully by this stage the person will either have told you they like a drink or you've been able to smell it on their breath. If this doesn't break the pattern then the problem may be a lot more serious. Refer to HR. Rhonda Bryant, PA The expert's view This situation is more difficult to handle than it might sound. Ideally, your company should have a clear policy on drug and alcohol use. For example, if staff members are working with the public, or critically, with transport or machinery, of course they shouldn't be drinking. But there are others way in which drinking can affect the workplace. If a colleague has had problems with alcohol in the past, working with someone who smells of alcohol, for example, could bring up a lot of painful issues for them. Even a few units will impair your judgment so this person's performance at work will be dipping. There are two possible responses to this situation: one is the disciplinary response, such as a suspension or a written warning, which a manager should choose if safety has been compromised - for example if a staff member is drinking and driving. But in this case, as a concerned line manager, try the compassionate response. Speak to them alone and open with a transitional statement such as: \"How are things?\" Tell them you are asking because you have some concerns and keep a light touch. Challenge them on observable data, such as errors made at work, or an unusual pattern of absence - don't make assumptions. If they disclose that they have been drinking, perhaps because of stress, you can refer the staff member to your HR department. They might need to take some sick leave or talk to their doctor. But if this person says: \"Leave me alone, I don't have a problem\" you should make an appointment to see them again in six months. If there are no changes in performance it might become a disciplinary matter.
