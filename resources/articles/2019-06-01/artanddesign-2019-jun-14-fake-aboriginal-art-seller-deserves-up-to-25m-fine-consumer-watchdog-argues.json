In October the federal court found that Birubi Art had \u201cmade false or misleading representations that products it sold were made in Australia and hand-painted by Australian Aboriginal persons, in breach of the Australian consumer law\u201d. At Friday\u2019s penalties hearing Justice Melissa Perry of the federal court said the penalty sought by the ACCC was \u201cvery substantial\u201d and could be seen as oppressive, since Birubi Art has already gone into liquidation. But the ACCC argued that any penalty should signify the \u201cserious cultural harm\u201d done by fake Aboriginal art. These harms were \u201cgrave and far-reaching\u201d and involved \u201cnot just direct economic loss but a weakening of the value of the authentic products\u201d and an \u201cerosion of consumer confidence in the entire sector\u201d, the ACCC told the court. \u201cThe message should be: \u2018Don\u2019t represent goods with an authenticity they do not have.\u2019 In choosing profits over harms, the consequences may be \u2026 as dire as going out of business.\u201d Between July 2015 and November 2017, the ACCC said, Birubi sold more than 18,000 boomerangs, bullroarers, didgeridoos and message stones to retail outlets around Australia, featuring designs \u201cassociated with Australian Aboriginal art\u201d and labelled with words such as \u201cAboriginal Art\u201d, \u201cgenuine\u201d and \u201cAustralia\u201d. \u201cIt was unacceptable that Birubi sold Indonesian-made products as having being hand-painted by Australian Aboriginal persons when that was not the case,\u201d the ACCC commissioner, Sarah Court, said at the time. Perry is expected to hand down her decision in coming weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
