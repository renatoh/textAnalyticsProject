I mean you hear chatter over the years, but just in these last few weeks it\u2019s really, really ramped up,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cMost of the time people are OK, they\u2019re not staunchly against it once you tell them the science and the statistics [but] we have had people walk out in hysteria, saying that there is absolutely no way their dog is getting [vaccinated] because they believe it causes auto-immune diseases or, specifically, autism.\u201d Kovac is so perturbed by the trend that he felt moved to speak out about it in Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph this week, saying he didn\u2019t believe anti-vaxxers deserved to have animals as pets if they were willing to put them at risk of diseases such as canine parvovirus. \u201cThey are sentencing their dog to death from one of the most shocking, horrible viruses you can imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a disease as contagious, as horrific and with a high mortality rate as parvovirus existed for humans, this conversation would be so different.\u201d Vaccinations do not cause autism in dogs or humans. But there is an important distinction: there is no such thing as autism in dogs. \u201cWell, there are certainly no recorded cases of animals with the condition that I know of,\u201d Kovac says. \u201cAnd there is no diagnostic test to check for it in dogs or cats anyway.\u201d The amplification of the anti-vaccination movement in online communities and its association with the rise of populism and anti-establishment politics has been well documented. This year the World Health Organisation included \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d among its 10 biggest threats to global health, pointing to a 30% increase in the number of cases of measles worldwide and a \u201cresurgence\u201d of the disease in countries that were close to eliminating it. In March, the head of Britain\u2019s National Health Service, Simon Stevens, blamed \u201cfake news\u201d by \u201cvaccination deniers\u201d on social media for a tripling in measles cases in the UK in 2018. In December a Guardian investigation pointed to the way populist rightwing politicians in Europe and the US were capitalising on the mistrust of vaccine science. In 2015 Donald Trump wrongly linked vaccination schedules to autism in a debate during the Republican primaries, while in Australia One Nation leader Pauline Hanson was forced to apologise in 2017 after she asserted that the government\u2019s vaccination policies amounted to blackmail. But are our four-legged friends really the latest front in the anti-vaccination movement\u2019s war? Naomi Smith, a sociologist from the Federation University in Victoria, has published research mapping out the anti-vaccination movement\u2019s presence on social media by trawling through hundreds of thousands of posts and comments on popular anti-vaccination Facebook pages. The anti-vaccination movement was not born with social media, but Smith\u2019s research highlights the role social media plays in fostering and amplifying its conspiracy theories. Did they talk about dogs, though? \u201cWell, no, they didn\u2019t, but what was really interesting is that after we published I got emails from vets saying we have seen this in our space too,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cSo it didn\u2019t come up in our data but it\u2019s definitely something I\u2019ve heard about since, because people have approached me about it.\u201d Most concerning was an email from an equine veterinarian in Queensland, who told Smith he continually faced reluctance from anti-vaxxers opposed to the Hendra virus vaccine. The Hendra vaccine is not without critics \u2013 last year horse owners from New South Wales and Queensland launched a class action against the pharmaceutical company responsible for developing it, claiming it did not provide adequate warnings about potential side effects. But Paula Parker, the president of the Australian Veterinary Association, believes much of the opposition to the virus is based on \u201cbad-faith\u201d arguments. \u201cThere are unfortunately some people making bad-faith arguments about Hendra, and some who get into internet rabbit holes and come out misinformed, it\u2019s heartbreaking to us because it\u2019s an amazing vaccine for a disease which is life-threatening to horses and humans,\u201d Parker says. She too is aware of a broader reluctance among a small number of pet owners to vaccinate, and sees a link with the flourishing market for \u201cholistic\u201d animal care, which she says \u201canecdotally seem to breed some reluctance to vaccinations or other conventional treatments\u201d. \u201cThere are some complementary therapies like acupuncture which are helpful adjuncts to conventional medicine, [but] the difficult part with homeopathy is there is no regulation in that space,\u201d she says. \u201cMost of them don\u2019t cause harm, they\u2019re just not effective, but the biggest worry is that pet owners seek out that kind of care and delay a diagnosis and required treatment.\u201d For Smith, too, there is a clear link between the so-called wellness industry and the spread of anti-vaccination messaging. \u201cWhat\u2019s super interesting about the wellness movement, or industry, is that anyone can talk about it, you don\u2019t have to have any kind of credentials, and it seems to be that those conversations naturally lead to a suspicion of established bio-medical practices,\u201d she says. Smith points to the example of Taylor Winterstein, wife of the Penrith Panthers NRL player Frank Winterstein, who claims vaccines cause allergies and believes parents are being \u201cbullied\u201d by GPs who \u201cpressure\u201d them to give their children vaccinations. The Daily Telegraph reported last month that Winterstein was charging $200 for \u201cinformative\u201d workshops, teaching other parents about her views. Winterstein told the paper she had \u201cnever once said not to vaccinate\u201d, but added: \u201cVaccines are not safe and effective for everyone, a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 schedule does not fit all bio-individual children and where there is risk there must always be choice.\u201d Smith is critical of that approach: \u201cYou\u2019ve got footballers\u2019 wives holding anti-vaccination seminars and their credentials are essentially being very good looking, which somehow means they\u2019re speaking to some deeper truth that they understand what it is to be healthy,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re very food- and diet-obsessed in this culture and people are constantly looking for advice about how to be healthy, which is fine, but that\u2019s not all that these people are selling.\u201d That the anti-vaccination movement would turn its attention to animals is unsurprising to Smith. \u201cThis attitude towards, I say this in quotation marks, \u2018bodily and dietary purity\u2019, is being translated by people into their pets because we view pets as part of the family now,\u201d she says. \u201cSo if you\u2019re taking on the attitude that you\u2019re going to keep your family, again, quote-unquote, \u2018safe\u2019, why wouldn\u2019t you extend it to your dog too?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
