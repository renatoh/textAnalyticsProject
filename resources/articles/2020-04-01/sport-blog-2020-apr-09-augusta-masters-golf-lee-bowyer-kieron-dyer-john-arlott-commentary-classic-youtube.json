We could cheer you up with glorious Masters moments of years gone by: Sandy Lyle\u2019s stunning bunker shot from 1988 or Tiger\u2019s \u201cin your life\u201d chip-in at 16 from 2005. But let\u2019s also reflect the theme of crashing disappointment. So, here\u2019s Larry Mize chipping in to break Greg Norman\u2019s heart and win the 1987 Masters in a playoff and how about handy linksman Alan Hansen talking you through Norman\u2019s infamous 1996 collapse against Nick Faldo. Then there\u2019s the Masters\u2019 excruciating equivalent of meeting the in-laws for the first time: here\u2019s a Butler Cabin special from 2012 with Bubba Watson botching his handshake with Augusta National chairman Billy Payne. And a sliding doors moment. It could have been oh so different for Tiger last year had this security guard connected properly. 2) It was 15 years ago last weekend that Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer put their dukes up against each while playing for the same Newcastle United team. Here\u2019s Dyer\u2019s take on the issue nine years later. That brought back memories of David Batty and Graeme Le Saux\u2019s fisticuffs in Blackburn shirts at Spartak Moscow in 1995. 3) Also due to start this week, the county cricket season, for which the weather would have been just fine, but instead there\u2019s time to look back on Essex\u2019s victory in last year\u2019s County Championship. Essex were also victorious in the Vitality Blast Twenty20 finals. For those needing a cricket fix, how about John Arlott\u2019s Vintage Cricket, a collection of some of the legendary commentator\u2019s favourite moments, and featuring that much-missed Hampshire burr. Here\u2019s Arlott\u2019s commentary on Geoffrey Boycott\u2019s maiden Test century, against Australia at The Oval in 1964. 4) Zinedine Zidane had quite the first touch. In fact, apologies \u2013 that probably shouldn\u2019t be in the past tense. Trevor Francis wasn\u2019t exactly indelicate either. 5) More from when sport and video games collide \u2026 Shaq Fu! And here he is in Ready 2 Rumble Boxing too (which also features Michael Jackson and \u2013 eh? \u2013 both Bill and Hillary Clinton) \u2026 and UFC Undisputed 2010. But Shaquille O\u2019Neal is arguably not the weirdest cross-pollination of the beat \u2019em up genre: here\u2019s Fighters Megamix, where one of the unlockable characters is an anthropomorphised stock car from Daytona USA. Bill Clinton, of course, also found his way into NBA Jam. Our favourites from below the line last week 1) Adriano Solano of Venezuela, possibly the world\u2019s worst competitive cross-county skier. 2) Speedball 2, an absolute classic, futuristic kick-ass Rollerball-style ruck on the Amiga, was a surprising nomination for a second-tier sport-related video game. Two from the BBC Micro are surer bets: Dare Devil Denis and the superbly primitive Graham Gooch\u2019s Test Cricket, a game that could be played entirely with the space bar. The latter was perhaps outclassed by Brian Lara Cricket on the Mega-Drive. 3) Leeds Rhino Adrian Morley gets KO-ed by Wigan Warriors\u2019 Mick Cassidy in 1998, not that Morley couldn\u2019t dish it out himself.
