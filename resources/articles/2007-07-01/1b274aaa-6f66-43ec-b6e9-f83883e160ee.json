McIlroy, 18 years old and a product of Holywood Golf Club near Belfast, outscored his hero, Tiger Woods, by a stroke and left both his illustrious playing partners, Henrik Stenson and Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez, in his wake. Perhaps most impressive of all, by the time he left the final green at about 6.30 last night he was the only player in the field not to have carded a bogey. Smiling from tee to green and swinging with total commitment - never more so than when arrowing a two-iron 230 yards upwind into the heart of the 18th green - he made Carnoustie look a breeze and summoned memories of Justin Rose's assault on Birkdale at the same age in 1998 when he finished tied fourth. \"I came here just wanting to make the cut and win the silver medal [awarded to the leading amateur] and that was about it,\" he said. \"I sort of came into it just trying to learn as much as possible. But it's a pretty special feeling to think that you shot one better than Tiger, and to beat your playing partners as well in Henrik and Miguel. It's just awesome.\" The son of a scratch golfer, McIlroy has been playing and beating friends since he was seven, and yesterday while he mastered Carnoustie some of them operated the scoreboards that marked his progress. By the end of his round it was not only his pals in the scoreboards and the large contingent from his home club who were rooting for him. As he walked on to the final green he was the toast of the stands and received a huge ovation. \"It was fantastic. It just sent a chill down my spine.\" McIlroy's talent has been an open secret in Northern Ireland for some years and he has been nurtured by support from the Sports Council and the Irish Golf Union, who have funded his career worldwide since he left school aged 16 with \"a few\" GCSEs. He resisted the lure of travelling to America to complete his golf education in the university system - \"I didn't really fancy the school part,\" he conceded - preferring to stay within the amateur fold in Europe and take up the occasional invitation to professional events. Thus far it is paying off. He won the European amateur championship last year to win his place in the Open, and made the cut in his first professional event, the Dubai Desert Classic, this year. Stenson, one of the longest hitters in the world, is among those impressed: \"He's a fantastic player. He's fearless, a fantastic ball striker, a good putter, he was matching my drives and he seems to have it all. I don't want to put him under pressure but I think he's got what it takes.\" McIlroy already interviews like a professional, a by-product of having been the subject of journalists' inquiries since he was seven. He mourned the passing of two short putts that might have turned 68 into 66, and set his sights on matching Rose's 1998 effort. \"I didn't make a birdie at either of the two par fives, which is disappointing,\" he said. \"But I'll take 68, and I'll take three more, thanks, and see where I finish. Justin's performance at Birkdale was phenomenal and I think if he can do it at that age I'm sure I can as well. That's going to be my mindset for the next few days.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
