The crowd at Cardiff seems to have shared this view, remaining quirkily musical rather than, say, transported by umbrella-gnawing paroxysms. This is certainly the mood projected by the Sky Sports commentary box, which has remained on the whole ruminative, twitchy and sombrely expectant. You have to feel a little sorry for them. This is, after all, still Test cricket, a game of light drizzle and the odd squally shower, rather than continual 24-hour post-nuclear lightning bolts. There is no doubt that we were spoilt by the fluke of 2005, a series that turned out to be an unceasing 25-day orgy of Big Moments. And oddly, from an English point of view, we may also have been spoilt by all those sadistic green-hatted greats of the last 20 years. It took about six months for the English to develop a hand-wringing nostalgia for the beatings handed out by the West Indians of the 1980s. Perhaps this process has happened even quicker this time. \"Simon Katich is a limited player by Australian standards,\" mused Michael Atherton in the Sky box, and watching Katich fidget his way to a sweatily efficient century in Cardiff yesterday, there must have been more than one Englishman lamenting, secretly, the absence of the terrible Waugh, Gilchrist the bully and even the unforgivable Hayden. Which is part of the problem facing Sky. Before the start of this series the 2005 highlights reel was worn thin with its nightly outings. Between overs here they still keep showing an advert with a clip of Brett Lee being caught during the 2005 Oval Test, to scenes of near-hysteria. This is Sky's first home Ashes series and they've shaped their summer around hopes of another subscription-shifting grand bouffe of high-cholesterol Big Moments. Well, it's not like that any more. Even England's exuberant 68-run ninth-wicket stand yesterday felt like a deflation of tension, rather than an initiative being brilliantly wrested. When England bowled it was as much as the commentary box could manage to become slightly upset about the line of attack to the excitingly loopy Phillip Hughes, a man who bats like a genius tail-ender, the Bradman of tail-enders. \"I. Don't. Think. They. Have bowled. To Hughes. That well,\" muttered Michael Holding, almost managing to convince you he really was cross. And as Andrew Flintoff finally beat Hughes' flailing bat David Lloyd erupted with: \"Well bowled! That's a reminder of 2005!\" Bumble, you felt like saying, it's OK. We understand. Times change. Flintoff did at least give us a Big Moment, getting Hughes to nick one. He even did his muscle-pose-Colossus celebration, albeit a slightly self-conscious version. Ian Botham, who chafes and twiddles his way through these slow-drizzle days, suddenly woke up. \"The wicket's got the crowd going \u2013 there's a buzz,\" he exclaimed, but there wasn't really, just a faint 2009-vintage hum. So we settled for limpidly-framed super slow-mo close-ups of Katich fiddling with his box. And then another greedily seized-upon Big Moment as Ricky Pointing scored his 11,000th Test run. \"One of the greats,\" was the verdict in the Sky box. Look at that average. What a player. Oh yes. Big Moment everyone. Big Moment over here. Sky usually gives us some new viewing oddity at the start of the summer: Hotspot, Hawk-Eye, Shane Warne's lush and silky hairpiece. Their only real gimmick this year is that you can now watch the Ashes on your computer or your phone via \"multi-platform viewing\". Plus the challenge of turning their own multi-angled eye, their heavy cannons, on what might well be a more finely-etched series of steady momentum shifts, glacial rearguards, and all of Test cricket's other, more customary small moments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
