Carrick, who made a first league start for two months against Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend following a calf injury, scored United\u2019s second in 3-0 win, including a first with his head for the club. And, following City\u2019s 1-0 defeat at Burnley, United are just two points adrift of the champions before Sunday\u2019s trip to Liverpool. \u201cWe\u2019re within touching distance now, said the midfielder. \u201cYou look at the table now and it is so tight. But I suppose really we\u2019ve just got to look to next Sunday. There are going to be ups and downs because that is how it is, especially in the last nine or 10 games. Sunday is a big game for a lot of reasons and that is probably all we can focus on at the moment. \u201cFor this club it\u2019s [the Champions League] the place to be isn\u2019t it?\u201d the 33-year-old added. \u201cWe had been in it for so long and not being involved on the big nights [this season] makes you realise what it is all about.\u201d He understands, however, that the pressure will now be cranked up in United\u2019s remaining nine matches \u2013 beginning at Anfield. \u201cHopefully when that pressure kicks in, and it goes up and up, then we perform even better, and we\u2019re going to have to in the weeks to come,\u201d he said. The display against Spurs was United\u2019s best under the current manager Louis van Gaal. What was the difference? \u201cSometimes it clicks and works well, sometimes it doesn\u2019t work so well. It came together well [against Tottenham],\u201d Carrick added. \u201cWe were a real threat going forward, we controlled the game well, and had a really good balance. We had a good tempo, we attacked with speed and we had penetration when we did go forward. We kept the ball when we had to and got the balance right really. All in all we can\u2019t be too picky \u2013 it was a good all-round performance. \u201cTottenham are a good side, we knew that going into the game, and we\u2019ve beaten them and we\u2019ve picked up an important three points,\u201d the player who cost \u00a318.6m from the White Hart Lane club in June 2006 added. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t count for anything more than that. It will give us confidence, of course, but in terms of what it means to anyone else it is not for me to answer really. I think it is just more for us a big boost going into another big one [at Anfield].\u201d The manner of the win offered some evidence that Van Gaal\u2019s methods are finally working. \u201cThe players are behind him, of course,\u201d Carrick said. \u201cIt is just that results prove everything don\u2019t they? We can improve on the training pitch, we can get better there, but it is all about what we do on game day really. And it was probably a big step for us in terms of the size of the game and to play like we did I think will give everyone a big boost and big shot of confidence. \u201cAnd it shows we are moving in the right direction, which is good. But it is no good settling for that. We still need to keep on that upward curve. I think it has to be our best performance of the season given the importance of the game. After the first few minutes, when we made a couple of little mistakes, I thought we controlled the game well and looked a real threat going forward. \u201c Obviously before the game we didn\u2019t think it was going to be that easy, so we are over the moon with the result. It sets us up for another big game at Anfield on Sunday. Every game is important now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
