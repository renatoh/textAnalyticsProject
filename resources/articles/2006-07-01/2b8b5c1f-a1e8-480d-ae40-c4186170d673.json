Jazz pianist and composer Herbie Hancock (currently touring Europe) has had a similarly episodic career, with commercial success in three decades (Watermelon Man, Head Hunters and Rockit) and a constant urge to innovate. Yet unlike Miles - his old boss - he has regularly revisited the style that made him famous: the free-flowing modern jazz of the mid-1960s. So attempting to assemble an \"essential\" list of Hancock tracks is a challenge, even when you have a double CD to fill. This collection ranges from the early Blue Notes to his 2000 album Gershwin's World, via Sonny Rollins, Miles and VSOP, but eschewing his recent sampling experiments (in his new band with guitarist Lionel Loueke) and the jazz-lite duets you can buy in Starbucks. You can't go too wrong with a compilation that includes gems such as Maiden Voyage and Butterfly, together with curiosities (Joanna's Theme from Death Wish, St Louis Blues) and all the hits - plus some of the best jazz piano-playing of the past four decades."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
