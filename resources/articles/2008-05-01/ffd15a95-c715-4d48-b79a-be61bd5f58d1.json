Launched in Oxfordshire two years ago with the aim of spotlighting home-grown composers who have slipped through the net of history, it seems to have found a niche, even if it appears to campaign for music of a generally conservative outlook - I don't foresee pieces by Elisabeth Lutyens, perhaps the most neglected of all British composers from the 20th century, appearing very often in the programmes, for instance. Concerts blend the reassuringly familiar with the less well known. There's music by Elgar, Holst, Vaughan Williams and Finzi alongside the revivals, and it was to those good causes that the opening concert, the BBC Concert Orchestra under Barry Wordsworth, was devoted, with pieces by Alan Rawsthorne, Alexander Mackenzie, and, more substantially, the symphonic poem The Birds of Rhiannon by Joseph Holbrooke, and the Celtic Symphony by Granville Bantock. Holbrooke (1878-1958) is a curious figure, born in Croydon but obsessed with Celtic culture in his eight operas and orchestral works. He was known as the \"Cockney Wagner\", but his music seems more indebted to C\u00e9sar Franck. The Birds of Rhiannon draws its themes from an operatic trilogy and shapes them into a sprawling movement that adds up to less than the sum of its sometimes winningly scored parts. Bantock's 1940 Celtic Symphony, for strings and harps is an even odder amalgam of Scottish folk tunes and spacious, Vaughan Williams-like sonorities that, like much of Bantock, deserves occasional airings, probably at gatherings of the faithful just like this one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
