We originally had quarterly bills that we paid at the Post Office, until one day there was a dispute about payment - British Gas said we hadn't paid, I complained several times and eventually it was agreed the relevant bill had been paid. This was five years ago and I seem to remember asking about setting up direct debit payments at the time, but haven't given it any thought since then. As my partner and I don't have a joint account, I assumed she was paying the direct debit and she assumed I was. It was only at the end of last year we finally realised neither of us has been paying. Now we are worried that if we get in touch with British Gas it will want payment in full for five years worth of gas, and we wouldn't be able to pay that. What can we do? E A You remain legally responsible for your debts for up to six years from the date you last contacted the creditor or paid it any money towards your debt. Generally speaking, if there has been no contact between you and the creditor for six years, you can claim your debt is statute barred under the conditions of the Limitations Act and thus should be written off. At first glance, therefore, it seems as if you only need to dodge British Gas for another year to be able to write off whatever you owe. But your situation is trickier than this because your debt is not absolute - that is, it's not a finite sum of money relating to a specific period, it's ongoing. Every day you use gas your debt increases, and the relevant time period is fluid: for example, after six years, while you could potentially write off anything owed six years previously, you wouldn't be able to write off what you owe from five years ago, or four years ago, or three etc. This problem will persist for as long as British Gas supplies you - the statute of limitations would only apply if you cancelled your British Gas account and then sweated it out for a further six years. But it seems unlikely that British Gas will fail to notice five years' worth of unpaid fuel bills (even though it has never sent you any) if you contact the company to terminate your account! I don't really know what to advise - you are definitely liable for the cost of the fuel you have used, and it's no defence to argue that you didn't receive any bills - it is still your responsibility. But five years worth of gas will not come cheap. The best course of action is not to do anything rash - you need some legal advice before proceeding, so I suggest you contact your local Citizen's Advice Bureau for more help."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
