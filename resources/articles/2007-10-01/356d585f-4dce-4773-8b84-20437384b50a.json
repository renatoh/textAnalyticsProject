Their precision flying scribed in coloured smoke-trails a perfect heart with an arrow searing through it, though surely a broken heart would have been more apposite. Twice now in a month the American has proved too good for our very best. In Osaka in the 10,000m final she denied Jo Pavey probably her best ever chance of a global championship medal, relegating her to fourth. On Sunday she produced one of the quickest ever half-marathon performances at her first attempt and in doing so took the wind out of Paula Radcliffe's comeback. Goucher seemed as surprised as anyone and was almost apologetic afterwards. As she and her husband Adam, who competed in the men's race, received congratulations in the hospitality marquee overlooking the North Sea I was struck by the irony that her success this year appears to have been founded on time spent in a different type of tent as far from sea level as practically possible. Having some sort of base at altitude is now a must for any world-class distance runner and Radcliffe came to Tyneside pretty much straight from Font Romeu in the French Pyrenees, but the Gouchers appear to be reaping the benefits more than most. They are under the tutelage of Alberto Salazar, the former marathon great employed by Nike who is responsible for their altitude training programme designed to put even more science into the traditional practice of maximising red blood cell production. For most this still means training in the mountains but increasingly it involves hypoxic tents, where the pressure can be adjusted to mimic any altitude and it is where many sleeping hours are spent. Salazar likes to combine the two. In preparation for the world championships in Osaka his group trained at Park City in Utah at 7,000-8,000ft. In addition he advises sleeping in the tents at a setting of anything up to 13,000ft. The Colorado Altitude Centre is just one venue where more refined research on these methods is being conducted. It doesn't work for everyone but the successes experienced by Americans over the past three or four seasons cannot be a coincidence. The shoe companies have put significant resource into these programmes and distance running in the US is on a high, if you'll pardon the pun. Goucher is undoubtedly a good athlete but her performance on Sunday appears to be testimony to the benefits of such a regime. Of course if you have trained, slept and walked to school at altitude then it's pretty much in your blood, so to speak. Add a touch of greatness and years of hard training to get Haile Gebrselassie. His career has always been about reaching new heights and in Berlin on Sunday he smashed the world best for the marathon, taking 29sec off the record held by his great rival Paul Tergat; if there was any doubt that great 10,000m runners don't always get the marathon distance they have put paid to it. Whether or not Kara Goucher has a future in the marathon only time will tell but if she does it will be based on plenty of time up in the clouds. She might even bump into the Red Arrows."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
