After almost an hour of sustained pressure, Porto's breakthrough came when the defender Alex Sandro ran at the visitors' defence on the left flank and poked a pass through for Moutinho to side-foot the ball between the legs of the M\u00e1laga goalkeeper, Willy Caballero, on 56 minutes. Otherwise it was a tight game with few clear scoring chances. Porto, two-times European champions and in the knockout round for the seventh time in 10 years, were the hungrier team and mostly dictated the run of play. M\u00e1laga, making their debut in the competition after surprising the pundits by winning their group earlier in the tournament, were happy to keep possession and showed caution in attack. \"We were dominant, we pressured and we didn't let them play their game,\" Porto coach Vitor Pereira said. \"It's just a shame we didn't get a second goal.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
