They meet for the fifth time on Friday, in the third round of the Australian Open, and while that special buzz is no longer a given this is still a contest to savour. Federer looks more in command of his game and played with that easy power so familiar to his fans to beat the often hard-to-read Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-3, 7-5, 6-1 in the second round. Dimitrov remains an unfinished masterpiece and he may never refine his game to the point that his talent deserves, but he is invariably dangerous. On day three, the Bulgarian dipped in mid-match but had too much power and class at the end, and won comfortably enough, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5, against Argentina\u2019s Marco Trungelliti. Federer said of Dolgopolov: \u201cIt\u2019s a tough second round. In my opinion, he\u2019s better than a lot of the guys who are ranked ahead of him.\u201d The four-times Australian Open champion said he had put in extra time on his serve, and it showed in his speedy dispatch of the Ukrainian in milder conditions than prevailed earlier in the week. \u201cI think everybody should work on it, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only shot that we can actually really control. The rest we are reacting to.\u201d He also defended well against a player known for his quicksilver change of direction when the ball sits up for him. \u201cTo go from defence to offence in the blink of an eye, it\u2019s something I did so well for so many years. It\u2019s nice when you can prove it to yourself time and time again.\u201d Federer is fine-tuning his game this year without Stefan Edberg, who was quietly influential in nudging him back towards the net. Now Ivan Ljubicic is sitting in his box and Federer admits it has taken a little getting used to doing without a player who was such an inspiration for him. \u201cIt was always very special, of course, looking up to the player box and seeing Stefan there. Always felt somewhat surreal to have him support me and be there for me. That\u2019s why I had a great time with him. It was his birthday yesterday. I congratulated him. \u201cBut I have got used to Ivan now being on the team for the last sort of month or so. It\u2019s not that different anymore, like it maybe was at the very beginning. \u201cThere is always a different angle or something else you can work on or something that maybe you tend to forget sometimes. It\u2019s important to have an open mind. An extra per cent here, 5% overall can make a massive difference when you\u2019re talking about trying to win a tournament.\u201d Asked yet again how long he sees himself playing, Federer hinted that his interest is sustained by expected levels of success. He has not put a deadline on his career. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Time will tell. I think a lot of retired players could still be at this level, too. They just choose not to do it anymore. It\u2019s all in the mind, the body, family, travelling, so many things that are a part of this whole thing. \u201cIt\u2019s been going very well for me, and I hope to keep it up as long as I choose to play tennis. It\u2019s the least I expect, to be in the third round of a slam, obviously. So I\u2019m pumped up, playing well, feeling good. But there\u2019s always a danger [of disappointment]. Like last year the third round was the end for me. I hope to go further this time.\u201d Whether Dimitrov has a significant say in that we will discover on Friday. Elsewhere in that quarter of the draw, Nick Kyrgios will play the No6 seed, Tomas Berdych, after stamping his peculiar sense of style on the second round. The one-man Australian brass band swore his way through an entertaining 6-4, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2) win over Pablo Cuevas, changing his shorts in the second set after what has come to be known in polite circles as a wardrobe malfunction. Kyrgios also had the doctor look at a muscle strain in his racket arm, above his elbow, which has been a trouble zone for him in the past. Berdych\u2019s 6-4, 6-0, 6-3 win over Mirza Basic, whose surname is begging for embellishment, was way more conventional. Kyrgios was unsure if home support was going to help him beat Berdych. \u201cThe crowd\u2019s going to be crazy. They all love Berdych. He has a massive fanbase. He\u2019s one of the greatest players right now. I\u2019m not really thinking too far ahead. It\u2019s going to be a really good match.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
