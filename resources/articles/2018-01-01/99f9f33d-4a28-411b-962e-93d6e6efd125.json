In an interview with the House magazine, Butler said: \u201cI think if a trans woman wanted to be included in an all-women shortlist then that should be considered. \u201cI just don\u2019t think people really need to make a big fuss about it. I mean if one of my team members came into the office and decided that James wanted to be called Jane and was now a woman I would not say \u2018prove it, what do you mean?\u2019\u201d She added that Labour would be setting up an LGBT+ advisory board to review its policies. \u201cWe will be taking guidance and advice from people who are LGBT+ \u2013 who don\u2019t all agree \u2013 round the table, because they are not a homogeneous group who all agree on one thing or another. You need people who have lived experiences in order to make informed decisions.\u201d Her remarks follow the heated debate over the role of trans teenager Lily Madigan, who was elected women\u2019s officer at her constituency Labour party in Kent. Responding to Butler\u2019s remarks on all-women shortlists, Madigan told the Guardian: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a consideration, it should be the norm. As the party of equality we need to be compassionate and listening, but when it matters we must stand up and speak out. This means being clear that trans women are women, and trans men are men.\u201d Butler, the MP for Brent Central, also used the interview to call for her own party to publish its gender pay gap after the controversy over women\u2019s pay at the BBC. \u201cI think everybody should publish their gender pay gap,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that you have to see it and measure it to be able to correct it and so it is time for everything to be corrected.\u201d Butler denied that Theresa May was a feminist, despite the prime minister\u2019s longstanding support for bringing more women into parliament. \u201cNo [she isn\u2019t]. Not in my eyes and not in my measure of feminism. I don\u2019t think she is a friend of women. I think that \u2013 and I have got good reason for saying that \u2013 86% of the cuts have fallen on the shoulders of women form her government,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
