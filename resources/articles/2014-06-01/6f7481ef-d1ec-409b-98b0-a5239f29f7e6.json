The audit released Tuesday \u2013 of the University of California Berkeley, UC Los Angeles, California State University, Chico State and San Diego State \u2013 was ordered by California legislators in August 2013 after 32 female students filed a complaint with the US Department of Education, alleging the schools were mishandling sexual assault complaints. The audit advised California universities to make changes such as better victim notification and consistent and annual faculty, staff and student training. \"I\u2019m glad that a lot of the audit did corroborate what the survivors have been saying \u2013 [there] are some really big problems at UC Berkeley and other universities. Specifically, that students aren\u2019t educated about sexual assault,\" said Sofie Karasek, 20, a senior at Berkeley and one of the students who filed the complaint with the US Department of Education. The DoE announced in May that 55 schools, including Berkeley, are being investigated for their response to Title IX complaints. The audit urges universities to get better at informing their students of the reporting process for sexual assault complaints. It also recommends universities work to keep victims better appraised of the status of their case. In some instances highlighted by the audit, victims didn't receive updates for months or received them after administrators reached a resolution with the accused student. Some universities are working to improve victim notification. At UC Berkeley, a confidential survivor advocate is expected to be on campus in fall 2014. The audit also recommended more complete and annual training for faculty, staff and students. Often, faculty and staff received workplace sexual harassment training, but little training on how to respond to victims of sexual harassment and assault. For example, at UC Berkeley police received training in sexual assault investigation for five years, but not 2012. That year, only sexual assault investigators received training. Students, the report said, should be educated in sexual assault prevention and awareness in the first few weeks of school, when freshmen are at especially high risk for sexual assault. Some schools didn't enforce this existing standard, and what was contained in the educational materials varied in quality. Universities should monitor data about time and location of alleged assault to better target outreach efforts. Of the 80 cases the state auditor reviewed, one-third occurred or involved residence halls, the report recommended. Legislative reform efforts could be complicated. The five schools audited belong to two large, separate university systems in the state, one of which is largely independent from the California legislature's oversight. University of California Berkeley and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) are part of the University of California system. That system is fully governed by a board of regents, separated from the California legislature by the state's constitution. Sometimes state law requests, rather than requires, the UC system to take certain measure, the audit says. \"For example, under state law California State University (CSU) is required to provide educational and preventive information about sexual violence to students as part of established campus orientations. In contrast, UC is requested to do so,\" the audit said. On Friday, University of California President Janet Napolitano announced a system-wide task force to consider the audit's recommendations and improve sexual assault and harassment policies. \"We aim to be the national leader in combating sexual violence on campus,\" Napolitano said in a statement. \"The mission of this new task force is to continue to review and improve our efforts to make sure the University of California employs innovative, evidence-based and consistent practices across the system.\u201d 'My case was actually in the audit' Karasek's case was one of those included in the audit released on Tuesday. The leadership member of a school-sponsored club assaulted her while on a trip, she says. She took her complaint to a female member of the club's leadership, who reported it to the Gender Equity Resource Center (GenEq), described in an essay for the Guardian: \"To my surprise, GenEq, which is often a positive and inclusive space for many students, advised her against removing him from the organization. The Center advised that we should 'keep him close in case he does it again' so that he would 'have a community of friends to support him in processing it'. To me, this sounded bizarre: why should his healing process take precedent over the possibility that he could assault me again, or assault another person?\" After Karasek found out that more women had accused the same male student of assault, she and three more students filed a formal complaint with the university. \"My case was actually in the audit,\" said Karasek. \"It was really weird to be reading this, and actually learn this information about the case that I had never gotten from the university, to be learning it from the state audit.\" School administrators closed the case after five months, allowing the accused to go on a school-sponsored summer trip while the complaint was investigated. Administrators resolved the case because the accused quit the club, \"worked with university officials at the Center for Student Conduct to use rehabilitative resources such as counseling, [and] appeared to be credible in his description of remorse.\" In another Berkeley case, a coach was \"made aware\" that an athlete was drinking alcohol and was the victim of a recent on-campus sexual assault. Instead of immediately reporting the assault, the coach punished the victim and other team members for drinking, and referred her to a sports psychiatrist. Rather than help the victim, the psychiatrist, \"may have instead suggested that the sexual violence would not have occurred had the student not been consuming alcohol,\" the auditors wrote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
