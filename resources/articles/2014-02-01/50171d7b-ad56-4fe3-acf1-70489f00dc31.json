Lucky dip for lords", "bodyText": "Due to an error, about which he was ruefully good-natured, the former Black Country MP Dennis Turner, who died this week, entered the House of Lords in 2005 as Lord Bilston of Bilston and not, as he had intended, Lord Turner of Bilston. Perhaps, though, this error should become the norm for those who insist on leaving the commoner world behind. Newly created peers should be obliged to adopt titles with no link to the name under which they traded in the real world. Some, mainly Conservatives, do this already. Thus the Gummer brothers, John and Peter, are now respectively Lord Deben and Lord Chadlington, while Nicholas Edwards is Lord Crickhowell and the former Tory chief whip David Maclean savours the Cumbrian title of Lord Blencathra. Labour peers, with the notable exception of Lady Falkender, formerly Marcia Williams, tend to forego such flourishes, which is a pity. Instead, the dignitary who advises on titles should be required to help formulate an honorific for each new peer that reflects, perhaps, an outstanding characteristic, as Trollope's Duke of Omnium, who was indeed lord of all. Or, taking a cue from the way Atlantic hurricanes are named, where Katrina was followed by Lenny and Maria, each new peer might also be named in an alphabetical sequence. Some, including the peers themselves, will think this unduly frivolous, inconsistent with their lordly dignity. Yet where the House of Lords is concerned, surely no absurdity can be dismissed as too frivolous."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
