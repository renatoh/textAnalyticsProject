A lacklustre display led to large sections of the crowd booing the players, most notably after poor decisions by Raheem Sterling and Ryan Bertrand while the match was still goalless, and distracting themselves by making paper aeroplanes that ended up littering the playing surface. Kane\u2019s late winner, his 14th goal in nine games, lifted the mood and secured the group \u2013 England have now qualified for four successive major tournaments without losing a match \u2013 though it did not mask a poor performance. While Gareth Southgate conceded it was \u201cblindingly obvious we could have played better\u201d, it was Glenn\u2019s words earlier in the day that exposed familiar concerns. \u201cWe know we have not been leading edge in terms of psychological support for that senior team,\u201d said Glenn, speaking to sports industry executives at the Leaders Conference in London. \u201cEngland players do not travel well. They do not tend to play abroad, their familiarity with international camps is not that great. So we know there is a brittleness in unfamiliar circumstances which we have to deal with. Sam [Allardyce] took that mantle on and Gareth has taken it on too. That is not something that you wish for overnight. You have to work at it.\u201d Southgate will continue that task in the final qualifier in Lithuania on Sunday, with the FA having confirmed over the public address system at full-time that England will host Germany and Brazil next month \u2013 the teams occupying first and second place respectively in Fifa\u2019s rankings \u2013 as part of their preparations for the World Cup. \u201cTonight highlighted where we are,\u201d said Southgate, who intends to take his full squad to Vilnius. \u201cWe\u2019d have liked to have played more fluently and scored more goals. But, given what the team have been through over 18 months ... with what they are having to deal with in terms of expectation, criticism of their performances, it\u2019s tough for them. \u201cThey\u2019re giving everything they\u2019ve got. They haven\u2019t got many Champions League or league championship-winning medals in the group. They\u2019re a work in progress but they are giving everything for the shirt and they will improve in the next few years. They\u2019re maybe suffering the consequences of 25, 30, 40 years or whatever [of underachievement] but that isn\u2019t their fault. We have to give them the backing to go and believe.\u201d Southgate said he had been aware of the disquiet among supporters, with loud cheers whenever a paper aeroplane settled on the turf. \u201cIn this job and in terms of playing for England, you\u2019ve got to be resilient,\u201d he said. \u201cStick to your beliefs and together as a group. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of playing for England and managing England. We\u2019re a country of high expectations. I\u2019ve seen Bobby Robson get to a World Cup semi\u2011final and get hammered probably up until the quarter-final stage. I can rationalise it all. \u201cI just have to keep winning matches. We\u2019d love everyone to be fully supportive and right behind us. There\u2019s nothing better than feeling that but we have to give the performances that allow that to happen, give people that hope and encouragement. \u201cBeing there for this group of players who need help, need support, need encouragement in terms of what we\u2019re trying to do. The team we played against tonight had conceded four goals in the campaign, so it was never going to be a free-flowing 4-0. Did we set out to play as we did? No, of course not. But that\u2019s the way football is.\u201d Asked whether there is enough time to speed his team\u2019s evolution before the tournament, with potentially four friendlies and the Lithuania fixture to come, Southgate said: \u201cIt depends where you\u2019d like to be and what\u2019s realistic about how quickly you can improve. We have to maximise the capability and abilities we have. Are we going to become Spain in the next eight months? No we\u2019re not. But they\u2019ve got a squad of players who have won league and Champions League titles. Until you win things and can prove yourself on that stage, you can\u2019t consider yourself to be in that company. But our lads have a chance to play in that company again now. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for English football to be at the World Cup. Crucial for everybody. Critical for the economy as well, probably. I\u2019m not going to hide and say we are exactly where we want to be in terms of our development. But we have had, in my period in charge, six wins and two draws, one of the best defensive records in Europe in qualifying, we have goalscorers and we know where we can improve. \u201cIt is young team but there is potential and they are going to improve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
