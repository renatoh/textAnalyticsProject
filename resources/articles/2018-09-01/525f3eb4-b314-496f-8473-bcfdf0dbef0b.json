Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, accused the government of letting the UK\u2019s estimated 430,000 problem gamblers down, as he announced a number of policies that would tighten up betting regulations. The list of proposals, unveiled days before the party\u2019s annual conference in Liverpool, include: A \u00a3100m-a-year levy on gambling firms to fund addiction treatment. A ban on the use of credit cards to place bets. Rules to allow addicts to ask their bank to block gambling transactions. New clinical guidelines on treatment for problem gamblers. Watson said: \u201cProblem gambling is Britain\u2019s hidden epidemic and we must treat it as a public health emergency.\u201d He said existing regulations, introduced under the previous Labour government in 2007, were \u201cnot up to the job of protecting addicts\u201d. \u201cGambling companies have to take more responsibility for harm caused by their products and contribute more to research and treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must also face up to the negative effect the explosion in gambling advertising has had and act accordingly. \u201cThe refusal of the current government to address any of these issues is letting problem gamblers and their families down.\u201d Labour said gambling ads would be prohibited from \u201cwhistle to whistle\u201d of sports events, citing claims from academics that gamblers are more impulsive and reckless when betting on live games. As it stands, betting companies voluntarily restrict their advertising to live sports only. Research by the Guardian earlier this year found that this agreement still allowed for up to 90 minutes of gambling ads during the World Cup in Russia, prompting concerns about the impact on children. Several senior figures in the gambling world support restricting their own ability to advertise, amid concerns about their public image in the wake of the debate over fixed-odds betting terminals. William Hill\u2019s chief executive, Philip Bowcock, said the industry should \u201ccollaborate with government to reach a long-term solution that also addresses public concerns\u201d. But a government gambling review concluded earlier this year that there was not enough evidence to support new curbs on advertising. Broadcasters have also lobbied hard against a measure that would crimp revenue from gambling ads, worth up to \u00a3200m a year, according to a senior industry source. Chris Skidmore, Conservative vice-chairman for policy, said: \u201cLabour liberalised the gambling market when they were in power and have admitted that they were wrong. \u201cWe are correcting Labour\u2019s mistakes \u2013 ensuring tighter rules on gambling advertising, increasing protections around online gambling, launching a multimillion pound awareness campaign, commissioning research on the harms of problem gambling and slashing the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals, which were introduced under Labour. \u201cThis Conservative government is working to build a fairer society and ensure the most vulnerable are protected.\u201d A spokesperson for the Advertising Association said Labour\u2019s proposal would \u201chave a damaging economic effect on our UK commercial media landscape, as well as make watching live sport more expensive and less accessible for the UK public\u201d. Labour also backed calls from the GambleAware charity to make firms pay a mandatory levy to fund research and treatment. Watson said the existing voluntary levy should be increased tenfold to 1% of revenue and made compulsory, raising around \u00a3100m. Other measures include asking banks to help customers block gambling transactions on their debit cards, a service already offered by Monzo and Barclaycard. Labour would also ban the use of credit cards to place bets online."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
