'Isn't it beautiful, Howard? You know we have almost a thousand species of birds.' I knew. There were also more than a hundred species of cockroaches and countless different butterflies, as well as miniature red frogs with venomous skin, golden toads with luminous skin, and square trees: I had read the guidebooks. But they omitted to mention there were even more varieties of humans, often rolled into one, as typified by my guide Annie, an exquisite mix of Asian, European and indigenous Indian. I smiled and nodded. The pelican gave up and shot over the surface of the clear blue water. 'There are even more fish. Do you like snorkelling? It's my favourite sport.' The eight-seater cafe stood on a floating wooden platform surrounded by coral atolls and hidden by mangroves in an inlet where dolphins ate jellyfish, gave birth and popped up to greet children paddling canoes on their way to school. Cuddly two- and three-toed sloths hung comfortably from branches. Nearby, turtles would later crawl out and lay their eggs on the beach. A little further and you might catch a glimpse of some playful petting manatees, the rare sea cows that sailors once believed to be mermaids. We were on a remote island just off the coast of Panama, the only nation to have declared war on the United States since the Forties. For almost a century, American troops occupied and controlled the country, packing it full of military, air, and naval bases. US forces used it as a base to invade other countries, to hit drug barons and to train soldiers. In 1989, a US invasion force decided to take out dictator General Manuel Noriega, whom it had indicted for drug- trafficking and involvement in organised crime. During the operation, thousands of nationals were killed and dumped in mass graves. The Americans burned neighbourhoods, used tanks to crush families in their cars and left tens of thousands impoverished and homeless. But now it's OK. The GIs have gone. Fort Grant, once the most powerful defence complex in the world, is now a causeway for joggers and strollers. Fort Sherman, a former US army jungle training camp, is an ecological showcase. Fort Clayton, the old headquarters of US Army South, has been converted into the City of Knowledge (an academic community and technological park). Canopy Tower, once a US military radar post, is a bird-watching platform. Fort Davis and other buildings that once housed munitions and arms now have light industry and factories. Military bases are now tourist centres. The country runs itself. What happened? 'Howard, you look worried?' I didn't dare say what was on my mind - before Annie, the only Panamanian I had met was Noriega himself, in 1989. We were fellow inmates of Miami Metropolitan Correctional Centre and our court attendances sometimes coincided. Trained by former CIA chief George Bush (Senior), Noriega switched loyalties and began selling arms to Cuba and drug trafficking with Colombian cartels. For the first time, the US adopted the now familiar policy of invading a country to capture one criminal. 'I'm thinking about Panama and why its tourist industry seems in some ways to have just started,' I say. 'We have never needed it,' says Annie. 'Millions of people have always visited Panama for many other reasons. Do not forget we were Uncle Sam's favourite nephew. Now we have to survive alone and our government is not investing enough in tourism: it simply doesn't realise the potential.' 'But surely all these tropical jungle reserves, marine parks, virgin rainforest parks, wildlife refuges, protected historic sites and indigenous Indian reservation centres result from significant tourism development that has been going for some time?' 'No, we set them up with money from gringo and other foreign scientific foundations researching Panama's unique biodiversity. You should see the fish. I love snorkelling. Let's do it!' There is no direct flight to Panama from Europe and no Panamanian tourist office outside Panama. You can get there via Miami (an alternative I could not take without the risk of running into Noriega again) or Havana (infinitely preferable). Panama has miles of beautiful sandy and shell-covered beaches on two oceans and cheap high-quality hotels with excellent service and every conceivable water toy. The weather is warm all year round and the country boasts cheerful hospitality, extravagant scenery, the world's best drinking water, an overdose of flora and fauna and several autonomous Indian communities. Hurricanes do not get close, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions stopped long ago and tourists are almost impossible to find. 'You see her, Howard, the woman in the corner?' Annie was referring to a tiny lady with gold rings in her ears and nose, coloured beads on her forearms and calves and blue vertical lines painted on her forehead. She wore a pirate headscarf, a bright cloth around her waist and a mola blouse depicting psychedelic symbols. 'She is Kuna, one of our seven indigenous peoples.' Going back a few million years, an archipelago of unconnected volcanic islands surfaced between the land masses of North and South America and eventually spewed up enough lava to link and form an isthmus. Plants and terrestrial animals could now migrate between the top and bottom of the world. This mingling of previously isolated species enabled new ones to evolve. The new chunk of land provided an insurmountable barrier for fish and marine organisms. It redirected the flows of the world's greatest oceans, created the Gulf Stream and radically altered the global climate. Dense mountain ranges bisect the isthmus, causing differing climates on the Pacific (enormous tides) and Atlantic (little or no tide) coasts. Although people moving from North to South America, such as the Kuna, crossed the isthmus more than 10,000 years ago, the first Europeans did not visit until the early sixteenth century. Spanish explorers founded Old Panama, which became the natural jumping-off point for further conquests, its Renaissance-style construction serving as a model for all other colonial South American cities. Swarms of adventurers sailed off with the stolen gold, silver, pearls and other priceless treasures plundered from the Incas of Peru to unload at Old Panama. Mule trains took the booty across the 50-mile-wide isthmus, to where galleons waited, bound for Spain. The same galleons brought back European luxuries. Old Panama was, without doubt, the metropolis of the Pacific. After slaying most of the Indians, the Spanish imported slaves from their African colonies. Some ran away and set up communities in the jungle and on the Caribbean coast. Nevertheless, the Spanish did not have it all their own way. Soon to be Jamaica's governor, Sir Henry Morgan (described sometimes as the Welsh Alexander the Great but more often as a pox-ridden bundle of vices) terrorised the cocky conquistadores . With a mere handful of ruffians as his army, Morgan took over the main Spanish Caribbean ports, crossed the isthmus to the Pacific and sacked Old Panama. I had been in Panama a few days. A compatriot and fan of Morgan, I had visited Old Panama hoping to see a tribute to him. There was none; young Henry had obviously done a good job at sacking. When he left for Jamaica, the Spanish sneaked back in and moved all remains of Old Panama west. Now an elegant slum, Casco Viejo connects to the ruins of Old Panama via Panama City. I took a Diablo Rojo, one of the local buses decorated with colourful designs and pictures of superstars. Closer in atmosphere to Asian trading cities such as Hong Kong (due, no doubt, to similar bank secrecy laws and the consequent drug dollar), Panama City's urban sprawl of shimmering skyscrapers is, like all money-laundering centres, a hive of intrigue with its empty dark high-rise luxury apartments for which fictitious occupants pay astronomical rents. Young kids sold flowers and food to rush-hour commuters, sandwich-boards offered mortgages and furniture and gorgeous secretaries giggled on corners. I got off at Casco Viejo's Paseo de las Bovedas (Promenade of the Vaults) and walked on a high sea wall. Huge ships' horns moaned as they waited to change oceans through the world's greatest short cut. Below, a few dungeons had been converted to restaurants and art galleries. I strolled through cobbled alleyways, took photographs of crumbling colonial churches and of paint peeling from rotting walls and came across Parque Bolivar, where Simon Bolivar first urged the union of Latin American countries. He freed Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela from Spanish rule. Fuelled with tropical decadence, the area still buzzed with the filth and elegance of seventeenth-century Spain but also vibrated with sounds of revamping and restoring. Hammers and saws rang from inside gutted buildings with fa\u00e7ades as intact as any film set. Although dusk was falling, the Museo del Canal Interoceanico was still open. I walked in and learned everything about the Panama Canal. World commerce, travel and naval warfare have always focused on the only two isthmuses that link continents and separate oceans (Suez and Panama) and the bright idea of cutting a channel through the land masses dates from at least the reign of Pharaoh Necho (600BC). King Carlos V of Spain (1534) greedily sensed the wisdom of digging a ditch through Panama to take all the gold by sea from Peru to Spain, but settled for a network of cobblestone mule trails. Centuries later, gold was again the catalyst when canal digging began. A carpenter from New Jersey saw something shiny in Coloma, California: the rush was on. A railroad was opened across the isthmus and the miners travelling from the US East Coast to California, who had previously had to risk donating their scalps to the Apaches by travelling overland across North America, now had a more attractive alternative. Thousands stopped at Panama (then a province of Colombia) for lodgings, shopping and a few nights of debauchery. Indian merchants, Chinese laundries, brothels and bars made Panama rich, decadent and cool. During the nineteenth century, French technical schools were the finest in the world. Ferdinand de Lesseps had just built the Suez Canal and, with Alexandre Eiffel as part of the team, had little problem raising the readies for a Panama Canal. The French peacefully invaded Panama and French culture took root (Paul Gauguin worked there to finance his move to Martinique). But the French had overlooked the fact that digging through steep mountains of rock, clad with dense jungle and drowned by muddy rivers infested with deadly pests and diseases, was a lot harder and a lot more expensive than digging through the flat sandy beaches of the Mediterranean and Red Sea. The ditch was a bitch, an expensive one. 'In all the world, there is not, perhaps... so much swindling and villainy, so much foul disease, such a hideous dung-heap of moral and physical abomination as in the scene of this far-famed undertaking...' (British journalist James Anthony Froude, 1886). The French gave up. Panama decayed. Meanwhile, the United States saw the economic and military benefit of a fast passage through the Americas and drew up the Panama Canal Treaty which would enable it to take over the building of the canal. Colombia, however, rejected the treaty terms, so the US facilitated Panama's next independence bid by supplying money, guns and the odd warship. Panama got its independence from Colombia and the US got the sovereignty of the Canal Zone. The US took 10 years to create the world's biggest locks, dam and artificial lake and submerge 29 villages. Panama thrived again. I checked into Hotel Mar Alta, former home of a French canal builder. For the price of a night at a motorway motel, I enjoyed a dining room, office, sitting room, sun terrace, bedroom and maid's quarters. I could have stayed there forever. Instead, I caught a plane at dawn and flew up the canal from the Pacific to the Atlantic. An hour later, I was breakfasting in Bocas del Toro on the Caribbean island of Colon. Columbus (Cristobal Colon) tarried here when searching for a sea channel between Cuba (which he thought was Eastern Asia) and South America (known simply as the New World). It was his favourite spot and he affixed his name to many sites. A short flight from the hi-tech international banking centre of Panama City and a few minutes' ferry ride from Costa Rica, Bocas has no muggers, no tropical swamp, and no mosquitoes. Everything moves on water: water taxis deliver people from island to island, big boats arrive with city goods and passengers and little ones leave with fish, coconuts and bananas. Apart from a few female Scandinavian backpackers and a couple of Canadian surfers, the streets were full of locals in an everlasting act of celebration. Everything and everyone seemed festive. The pelican returned but quickly disappeared, as did the Kuna woman. A large parrot and a toucan took their places. 'What about looking at sunken shipwrecks, Howard? This is a diver's paradise. And we can snorkel?' said Annie. 'But I have only two days left in Panama, and I must take the eight-hour cruise down the canal. I've wanted to do that for years.' 'You are just like all the other gringos. This country is much more than just a canal.' 'And I want to go to Portobello.I want to see the Black Christ. My office in London is next to a road named after Portobello. It would be interesting.' Up to the 1870s, Portobello Road was a rough country track leading to Portobello Farm, named in honour of Admiral Vernon's capture of the city from the Spaniards in 1739. Sir Henry Morgan had done the same 50 years earlier. Maybe I would stumble across some Welsh graffiti. 'There is nothing there now, Howard, just a few bits of old forts. What the pirates didn't destroy, the gringos threw into the canal. There is no place to stay, no place to eat but we can go tomorrow if you forget the canal cruise and snorkel with me today.' Half an hour later, we were on a glass- bottomed boat heading towards Punta Caracol, a small complex of wooden gangways connecting guest-rooms with restaurants, shops and lavatories, all on the surface of a natural aquarium. I tried snorkelling but got scared by the manta rays and octopus. Freshly caught red snapper and a bottle of Chilean wine put me in an excellent mood. 'Howard, we must leave soon if you want to do more sightseeing. Or would you prefer to have a sleep in one of the rooms here? I'll snorkel a bit more and come to see you in an hour or so.' I am definitely going back to Panama soon and I will do the canal cruise and look for Morgan's loot. Is it true, Sir Henry, that you have never been defeated?' 'No, Duchess, I was once defeated by a woman who resisted my requests and turned down my sincere affection. That beautiful lady defeated me.' 'And was she really that beautiful, Sir Henry?' 'Incredibly beautiful, milady. Her eyes and face outshined the sun and the star. Only she, only she defeated me.' Factfile Howard Marks travelled to Panama with Trips Worldwide (0117 311 4404).
