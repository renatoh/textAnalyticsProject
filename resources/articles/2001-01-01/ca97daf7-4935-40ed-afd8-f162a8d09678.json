He wouldn't be going to St James' Park with the first team after all. The richest club in the world had accepted a bid for his services from a First Division play-off contender. Healy was now a Preston North End player, initially going on loan for five days as there appeared to be nobody at Deepdale over the holidays to do the medical. After four minutes at Bramall Lane on Saturday you could see why Preston are prepared to break the bank to rescue the 21-year-old Northern Ireland international from the Old Trafford sidelines. When Sean Gregan flicked on Gary Parkinson's corner, Healy reacted first to head the ball past Simon Tracey. In the 19th minute Sheffield United's centre-backs were so busy worrying about Healy that they allowed Mark Rankine to sneak between them to head a splendid second from Lee Cartwright's cross. Suddenly North End's \u00a31.5m record signing was beginning to look like the bargain of the season. And then reality took over. It is hard to judge whether Preston stopped playing or United finally woke up from their holiday hangovers. David Moyes left nobody at the post-match press conference in any doubt as to what he thought. \"You shouldn't lose when you are two goals up,\" said the Preston manager. The United fightback began with Bobby Ford's 28th-minute penalty after Parkinson's clumsy foul on David Kelly's ancient legs. The only surprise was that the equaliser took so long in coming, Paul Devlin's right-wing cross taking a deflection over Tracey for Kelly to head home at the far post after 70 minutes. The winner came 10 minutes later from James Thomas, who is on loan from Blackburn. The 21-year-old substitute finished off a Georges Santos flick-on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
