Are you real, lit, or looking for a real lit match? Do you even know what these words mean? If not, you probably need to lower your expectations on Tinder. Yesterday, the dating platform \u2013 which has an estimated 50 million users worldwide \u2013 released its Year in Swipe roundup: an analysis of user data and activity in the last year, that tells us how the world dated on the app in 2019. From Kombucha to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, we\u2019ve gone through the data to tell you what people were talking about the most in 2019 on Tinder. Australians are wide awoke Unlike in the US and the UK, Australian Tinder bios were full of almond milk, avo toast and the keto diet. Among those under the age of 25 \u2013 now the biggest age group on Tinder \u2013 the word vegan saw a 112% increase in Australian bios in 2019, and the word \u201ckombucha\u201d saw a 150% increase. Because nothing quite says \u201cI love you\u201d like good gut health and cutting your carbon footprint in half. Woke was also the most used word in Tinder bios in Australia \u2013 in the US and the UK, the word woke was the seventh most popular word. Mission: possible In 2019, young Tinder users are really interested in what your cause is. Among Generation Z, the most used term on Tinder was \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cmission\u201d, and in particular, issues such as climate change, social justice, environment and gun control were close to Tinder users\u2019 hearts. If that sounds daunting, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you \u2013 we\u2019ve drafted a little chat-up line for you to try: \u201cAre you my reusable coffee cup? Because I\u2019d like to have more than one drink with you.\u201d Elizabeth Warren as a prime topic? Maybe it\u2019s the way she collects billionaire tears and helps them work out their taxes. Maybe it\u2019s the way that she floored an aggressive Joe Biden, during the Democratic debates \u2013 a man who she would definitely beat in a push-up competition. Or maybe it was her quick-witted response to an outdated question on equal marriage. Whatever it is, Elizabeth Warren has earned fans on Tinder. Warren was one of the most mentioned politicians in Tinder bios and in conversation and saw four times more mentions this year compared with 2018 (Kamala Harris was mentioned twice as much). The list of politicians spoken about on Tinder skews slightly female: the list of top political figures also includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Greta Thunberg, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris. But what about the white men? I hear you ask. They\u2019re doing OK \u2013 and the top talked-about political men were: Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Donald Trump and surprisingly, Robert Mueller. Everyone loves Drake Drake\u2019s In My Feelings was the top Spotify song for Tinder users in every country in the world \u2013 so if you\u2019re really flagging, just ask your Tinder crush if they\u2019re riding and see what comes of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
