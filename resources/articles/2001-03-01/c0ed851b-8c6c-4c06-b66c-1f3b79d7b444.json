Both clubs and their supporters have reluctantly accepted this as the best option to ensure as many fans as possible can see the match, which will kick-off at 1.30 on Sunday April 8. Each club is expected to receive between 25-30,000 tickets. The other semi-final between Liverpool and Wycombe will take place at Villa Park at 4pm on the same day. Fears in Liverpool that they would be forced to play at Hillsborough were unfounded. The FA never entertained the idea. The FA decided on Old Trafford, capacity 68,936, for the other tie because with Wembley due for demolition and Twickenham ruled out because of local opposition no other London ground was big enough to satisfy the demand for tickets. There will be obvious fears about confrontations between rival fans at motorway services en route. But the prospect would have been greater in the confines of London's road and Tube system. There was also the chance of congestion in the capital as so many fans headed along similiar routes to the game. Chief inspector Tony Deacon, responsible for the Metropolitan police's public order section, said: \"We have had extensive talks with the FA. There were very limited options, and we are more than happy with the outcome.\" According to the FA's executive director David Davies: \"Even by recent standards, deciding on the venues for these matches was extremely difficult. Preliminary discussions took place even before the quarter-finals. \"Ultimately, with the backing of police forces in several parts of the country, supporters' groups and the clubs, we have reached a conclusion that will give as many fans as possible a chance to see these games.\" Both clubs accepted the decision. Arsenal described it as \"the best compromise under the circumstances\" while Tottenham's vice-chairman David Buchler said: \"We recognise the inconvenience for travelling supporters, but the choice ensures as many fans as possible see what should be a terrific game.\" Barry Baker, secretary of the Arsenal Supporters' Club, said: \"We feel the bigger the stadium, the better, so we have no problem.\" Bernie Kingsley of the Tottenham Independent Supporters' Association added: \"It's not ideal and we will probably have to set out about six in the morning to get there but they had to go for the biggest ground.\" Meanwhile, the FA have decided that in future the semi-final draw will be made only when all four sixth-round ties have been played. The Spurs manager George Graham had criticised the decision to make Sunday's draw before his team's tie with West Ham had finished. \"It was awful, wasn't it? It takes away the dignity of the competition,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
