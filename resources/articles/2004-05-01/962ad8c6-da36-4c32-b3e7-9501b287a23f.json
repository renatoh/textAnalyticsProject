Fish fats have a range of effects that protect against blockages in the vessels around the heart, and so help to stave off heart attacks. However, a significant proportion of heart-related deaths are due to the development of an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Several studies show that a higher intake of fish oils helps slow the heart rate. Osteoarthritis and ginger Osteoarthritis is a condition characterised by wear and tear of the spongy cartilage that lines and protects the body's joints. This most common of all arthritic conditions commonly affects weight-bearing joints, and may cause discomfort and disability. While conventional analgesics may work to quell the pain, these are known to cause unwanted effects including inflammation and bleeding in the lining of the gut. The results of a recent study published in the journal Osteoarthritis and Cartilage , however, suggest that ginger may represent a viable alternative to painkilling medication. Over 24 weeks, 250 mg of ginger extract taken four times each day was found to be significantly more effective than placebo at reducing pain and improving mobility in a group of sufferers. Ten tips for anti-ageing 1 Eat less The one dietary approach that has consistently been found to extend the life span of animals is simply to feed them less. A diet based on natural, nutrient-packed foods such as fruits, vegetables, eggs, meat, fish, nuts, seeds, beans and lentils will help the body get by on less without the need to go hungry. 2 Breakfast like a king People who eat early in the day tend to eat less overall than those who save up their food quota for the end of the day. Kicking off the day with a decent breakfast can help put a natural brake on the appetite in the long term. 3 Keep hydrated Drinking plenty of water has been linked with a reduced risk of major killers including heart disease and cancer, and helps to prevent overeating too. 4 Eat plenty of foods rich in vitamin C Vitamin C is what is known as an antioxidant nutrient, which means it helps quell molecules known as free radicals that are heavily implicated in the ageing process. Studies show that those consuming higher levels of vitamin C live longer than those consuming smaller amounts of this nutrient. Rich sources are citrus fruits, kiwi fruits, strawberries, blackcurrants, kale, red peppers, watercress, spinach and carrots. 5 Eat plenty of foods rich in beta-carotene Beta-carotene is an antioxidant that appears to protect against a variety of cancers, and animal studies show that high body levels of this nutrient are associated with increased life span. Beta-carotene-rich foods to emphasise in the diet include cantaloupe melon, spinach, carrots, kale, red pepper and watercress. 6 Take an antioxidant supplement Supplementing with antioxidant nutrients may combat the ageing process and protect against chronic illness. One study found that supplementation with the antioxidant mineral selenium reduced the risk of dying from cancer by 50 per cent. Suitable supplements are those that contain selenium in combination with other antioxidants such as vitamins A, C, E and zinc. 7 Avoid sugar Sugar can react with proteins in the body - a chemical reaction known as glycosylation - that accelerates the ageing process. Foods to avoid include those containing added sugars such as glucose, sucrose, fructose and high-fructose corn syrup. 8 Limit fast sugar-releasing carbohydrates in the diet Many starchy carbohydrates (such as potatoes and most breakfast cereals and breads) tend to induce the body to secrete copious quantities of insulin. Excesses of this hormone have been linked with the major age-related conditions including type two diabetes, heart disease and some forms of cancer. 9 Sleep Sleep is important for general wellbeing, and studies show that seven hours each night are optimum for maximum longevity. Getting a decent amount of shut-eye each night doesn't just add life to our years, but years to our life too. 10 Take regular exercise Studies suggest that even small improvements in fitness can significantly reduce the risk of death. Thirty minutes of aerobic exercise such a brisk walking or cycling on most days is likely to keep us going."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
