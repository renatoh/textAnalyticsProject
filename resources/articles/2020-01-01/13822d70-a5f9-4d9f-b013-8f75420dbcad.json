The 34-year-old will undergo a medical in Italy on Friday before signing an 18-month contract with Antonio Conte\u2019s side. Young is set to leave Old Trafford after almost nine years at the club, having joined from Aston Villa in 2011. Inter have been pursuing the England international for some time now but United were reluctant to let him leave in the middle of the season. However, after discussions between Young and the club, they accepted his wish to leave. Young is the third United player to join Inter in the past six months, with Romelu Lukaku and Alexis S\u00e1nchez also teaming up with Conte in Milan. S\u00e1nchez is there on loan until the end of the season. Inter are second in Serie A, two points behind leaders Juventus. They are also interested in signing Olivier Giroud from Chelsea and Christian Eriksen from Tottenham in this transfer window, and are pursuing a swap deal with Roma for full-back Leonardo Spinazzola, with forward Matteo Politano going the other way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
