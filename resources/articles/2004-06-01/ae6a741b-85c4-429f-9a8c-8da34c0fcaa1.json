At his funeral service at Washington's National Cathedral, former and current world leaders gathered to pay their respects to the one-time Hollywood actor who became the 40th US president. The former prime minister Margaret Thatcher opened the readings at the funeral of her \"dear friend\". She told the 4,000-strong congregation: \"We have lost a great president, a great American and a great man.\" Mrs Thatcher - who was present at the service, but who has stopped public speaking after suffering minor strokes - said: \"He helped to make the American dream live for millions all over the globe.\" She praised Reagan's bravery in shaping the post-cold war age, which she said had led the world, including former communist bloc countries, to say \"God bless America\". Also attending the service, which Reagan himself had planned meticulously, were the four living ex-US presidents - Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George Bush Snr. The prime minister, Tony Blair, and Prince Charles represented Britain. George Bush Snr said Reagan was loved because he was \"strong and gentle\". His voice heavy with emotion, Mr Bush said: \"I learned more from Ronald Reagan than from anyone I encountered in my years in public life.\" Mr Bush's son, the current US president, said: \"When the sun sets [today] ... a great American story will close.\" He added: \"He believed that people were basically good and had the right to be free. He believed bigotry and prejudice were the worst things a person could be guilty of. He believed America was not just a place in the world, but the hope in the world.\" Just after 11.15am local time (1615 BST), a motorcade bearing Reagan's coffin arrived at the cathedral after a 30-minute journey from Capitol Hill, where the coffin had been lying in state. Before it left Capitol Hill, Nancy Reagan visited her husband's casket in the Capitol rotunda, where thousands had visited to pay their respects. In a scene watched on television by millions of people throughout the US, she caressed the flag-draped coffin, giving it a kiss and several gentle pats. At the cathedral, before the arrival of Reagan's coffin, the Irish tenor Ronan Tynan sang Franz Schubert's Ave Maria. After the cortege arrived, the former president's casket was carried inside by body bearers drawn from each of the military services. US guns around the world were due to be fired in Reagan's honour. There were plans for 21-gun salutes to take place at every US military base with the artillery and staff to carry them out. After the service ended, the motorcade left the cathedral for Andrews air force base, outside Washington. The day will end with Reagan's sunset burial at his presidential library near Los Angeles. At dusk, there will be another worldwide round of gun salutes. Reagan's funeral has been described as the biggest state funeral to take place in Washington since John F Kennedy's more than 40 years ago. As a mark of respect, most government departments and financial markets were closing for the service. The funeral was the final public commemoration of Reagan after a week of remembrance. More than 100,000 people filed past his coffin as it lay at the presidential library in California before being flown to Washington on Wednesday. There, Reagan's body lay in state at the Capitol Rotunda for 34 hours. The coffin rested on the black velvet-covered catafalque that once bore the casket of President Lincoln, and police said more than 80,000 people had queued, some overnight, to pay their respects. The Reagans had specified an interfaith service, inviting participants from the Catholic, Jewish, Muslim and other religions. People throughout the US found ways to publicly mourn the president's passing. Church bells far and wide rang 40 times in honour of the president. Several state governors called for a moment of silence in their states during the funeral. Not since Lyndon Johnson died in 1973 has the US gone through the high pomp and ritual associated with a presidential state funeral. Former president Richard Nixon's family, acting on his wishes, bypassed Washington traditions when he died in 1994. Reagan died on Saturday at the age of 93."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
