Police were called to Moore Walk in Forest Gate on Monday and found two teenage boys, aged 14 and 17, with gunshot injuries. The Metropolitan police has named the 14-year-old as Corey Junior Davis from Forest Gate. The second victim is in a stable condition in hospital with \u201cpotentially life changing injuries\u201d. No arrests have been made. The Met has put extra officers on duty in the borough and authorised the use of stop and search tactics amid fears of retaliation. DCI Dave Whellams, leading the investigation, said: \u201cThis is a very tragic incident. A teenage boy\u2019s life has been taken in an extreme act of violence leaving his family utterly devastated. \u201cWe are pursuing all lines of inquiry to catch the person responsible for Corey\u2019s murder and are keen to hear from anyone who believes they might have information to come forward as it could prove vital to our investigation. \u201cOur thoughts are with Corey\u2019s family at this very difficult time.\u201c There has been a surge in gun crime in the capital in the past year. Met figures published in April revealed a 42% rise in gun offences \u2013 up to 2,544 compared with 1,793 between April 2015 and 2016."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
