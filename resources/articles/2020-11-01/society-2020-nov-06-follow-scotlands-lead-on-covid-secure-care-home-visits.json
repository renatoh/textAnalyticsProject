The English guidance says all residents should be allowed visits from family and friends in a Covid-secure way, but Scotland also sets out the frequency and duration expected of such visits. So long as the home has been Covid-free for 28 days, its visiting risk assessments have been approved by the local director of public health and its care workers are tested weekly, each resident can receive an indoor visit of up to four hours by one visitor and an outdoor visit of up to one hour by up to six people from no more than two households, weekly. Scotland also insists that \u201cessential visits\u201d must continue whatever the level of infection, and in a far wider set of circumstances than allowed for in England (where only \u201cend of life\u201d has been specified). In Scotland these visits should take place if the resident\u2019s health is or may be deteriorating, and where visiting may help with communication difficulties or ease significant stress. Applying Scotland\u2019s rules in England could save families from unimaginable anguish.
