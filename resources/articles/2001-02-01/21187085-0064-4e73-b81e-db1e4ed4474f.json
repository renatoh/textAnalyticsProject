They seemed poised for the worst result of all when two goals down at home to struggling Huddersfield, but eventually made it 2-2. . It was not until the last minute that they drew level, through a Per Frandsen free-kick, but Frandsen and Bolton's other scorer, Gudni Bergsson, had to share the spotlight with their goalkeeper, Steve Banks. He saved a Craig Armstrong penalty, when the score was 2-1. As Bolton's manager, Sam Allardyce, pointed out: 'It was a great game from a spectator's point of view, but not from a manager's health point of view.' He did not seem to be the only manager at the top to suffer. For example, Watford were held to a 2-2 draw by Portsmouth after being 2-0 ahead, and West Bromwich Albion also dropped two points at home after being a goal up against Stockport. Still, Watford's manager, Graham Taylor, insisted that he was not angry about his team's collapse. 'We have one of the worst defensive records in the division,' he acknowledged, 'but I would rather have a result like this than a boring 0-0 draw.' West Brom's manager, Gary Megson, seemed similarly laid back. He preferred to talk afterwards about the superb late Stockport equaliser by Kevin Cooper, who capped a determined charge through the middle by scoring from 20 yards. Megson bought Cooper for Stockport when he was manager of the club, and he said: 'Kevin is a gifted player, with a tremendous left foot. He only cost \u00a3150,000 from Derby and he has proved to be a marvellous acquisition. I thought our defence stood off him when he burst through the middle, but it was still a splendid goal.' Of the other leading teams, Fulham had to settle for a goalless draw at Barnsley, while Blackburn, like Birmingham, were beaten. Blackburn fell 2-1 at Nottingham Forest. But, like Taylor and Megson, their manager, Graeme Souness, was reluctant to make a fuss about it. 'We had to lose some time,' he said. 'We dominated the first half, and I'm sure if we had scored a goal we would have had the confidence and ability to go on and win the game - but that's football. ' At the other end, Sheffield Wednesday and QPR both suffered emphatic defeats - 4-1 and 5-0 against Wimbledon and Preston respectively. QPR's manager, Gerry Francis, said: 'Last week we outplayed Bolton. We have quite a number of players missing, but that doesn't excuse our lack of fight and spirit. I have told the players I was very, very embarrassed by their performance.' It was the same for Tranmere's manager, John Aldridge, as he watched his team lose 2-0 to Wolves. It was particularly embarrassing for Tranmere's captain, Sean Flynn, who scored the craziest of own goals through an attempted hooked clearance which turned into a fierce shot beyond his own goalkeeper. Aldridge, however, felt that Wolves fully deserved their success. 'The worrying thing for me is that they looked like they wanted it more than we did,' he said. 'I thought we had turned the corner, but today clearly showed this is not the case.' There is still no stopping Crystal Palace striker Clinton Morrison, who scored the goal which brought them their 2-1 win at Burnley. But the best individual scoring performance came in the Second Division, where Oldham's Canadian striker, Carlo Corazzin - without a goal in 10 matches - bagged four in their 5-1 win over Wrexham. There was a strong element of defiance at Hull, where the club's 14-day reprieve from a winding-up order last week was followed by a bumper crowd of almost 9,000 for the match against Leyton Orient - about 60 per cent higher than their usual attendance - and a 1-0 win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
