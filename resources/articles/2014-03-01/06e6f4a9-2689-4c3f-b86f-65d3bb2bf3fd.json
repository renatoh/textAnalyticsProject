Victor Trumper steps out to drive The cricket world owes a debt to George Beldam. An amateur all-rounder for Middlesex, Beldam was also one of the pioneers of sports photography in the early 20th century, latching onto new shutter-speed technology that allowed him to capture in freeze-frame even the most deft player movements. Importantly, he realised the limitations of taking shots from the boundary edge and so arranged to photograph the greats of cricket\u2019s golden age from close quarters. The most iconic of all his images is that of Australian batting hero Victor Trumper leaping out to drive. No longer subject to the same volume of literature as other Australian cricket icons like Bradman or Warne, it is through Beldam\u2019s image that we define Trumper; ironically so too, because the shot was staged for the camera on Australia\u2019s 1905 Ashes tour. \u201cIn composition and content, it is a very great photograph,\u201d said Gideon Haigh. \u201cIt is both the first and last word in batting, insofar as batting consists of making instinctive what begins as a set of quite unnatural motions.\u201d Another great Australian cricket writer, Jack Fingleton, said he felt cheated when it was pointed out to him by Richie Benaud that Trumper\u2019s body had been superimposed onto the background of Bramall Lane, Sheffield (this, it turned out, was not actually true). Still, he saw it as \u201cso perfect in the smallest detail\u201d for the way it presented Trumper\u2019s technique in more thrilling detail than we might have been afforded. The image and others in the series Beldam captured that day give fullest expression to Trumper\u2019s epic grandeur, preserving it for eternity. Without it we could comprehend little of Trumper\u2019s prowess, which was not captured in the now modest-looking statistics left by greats of the golden age. Sadly, the only surviving footage of Trumper batting features a single practice delivery, one in which an unseen bowler performs the unforgivable sin of sending a huge wide down the leg side thus ensuring we\u2019d never be able to watch a single one of Trumper\u2019s magnificent strokes. Other stills from Beldam\u2019s series on Trumper are equally impressive. One in which he plays a lofted on-drive manages in four frames to illustrate the dexterity of Trumper\u2019s technique as his feet move swiftly to the pitch of the ball and his bottom hand moves from a low position on the bat handle to meet his gloveless top hand milliseconds before he mightily clouts the ball. Only that can draw attention away from Trumper\u2019s imposing frame; tall, lean and chiseled with his Australian skull cap symbolic of the era. CB Fry, the man who put words to the famous images (in The Art of Batting, 1905), said that Trumper \u201chad no style and yet he was all style\u201d. It\u2019s thanks to George Beldam that we can truly understand what he meant. 2. Nicky Winmar makes a stand There are times when a photograph is able to transcend time and place and knock you sideways with its thundering impact. In Australian sport there is no greater example than Wayne Ludbey\u2019s shot of Nicky Winmar in 1993 responding to the racial taunts of the Collingwood fans at Victoria Park with a defiant display of pride. The gesture and its accompanying image set in motion a drastic re-think of the way the AFL dealt with racial abuse, a problem that continues to bubble at the surface of football, just as it does elsewhere in Australian society. When Winmar lifted his jumper, pointed at his skin and declared, \u201cI\u2019m black and I\u2019m proud to be black,\u201d Ludbey snapped an image that is emblematic not only within a sport, but a nation divided on issues of race and prejudice. Providing the decent case that a picture can tell so many more than a thousand words, the 20th anniversary of the incident brought with it an entire book, which sought to flesh out the struggle of Winmar and all indigenous Australians, and also shed light on Ludbey\u2019s image and a similar one snapped by his colleague John Feder. The author of that book, Matthew Klugman, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a more important popular Australian image over the last two decades. It\u2019s up there with the 1968 [Olympics] black power salute as a defining image of race and sport, and its enduring significance can be seen in the way it continues to be shown over and over again \u2013 in newspapers, posters, galleries and on city walls.\u201d Winmar, lean and athletic like his indigenous teammate Gilbert McAdam, had just run rampant over the Magpies to win St Kilda the game. Always more willing to offer public statements than his reclusive and intensely private teammate, McAdam said, \u201cAll I know is I wanted to make a statement that day.\u201d Having been racially vilified by members of the Collingwood cheer squad as he checked out the ground\u2019s surface at half-time of the reserves game, Mc Adam confronted Winmar in the centre of Victoria Park. \u201cI grabbed Nick and said, \u2018Boy, we have got to do something today. We have got to make a statement. We will show this mob ... we have got to make them quiet\u2019.\u201d Winmar and his teammate put on a clinic. \u201cI think Gilbert McAdam got the three votes and I was second best,\u201d recalled Winmar in 2009, \u201cand it was the first time St Kilda had won at Victoria Park in ages. But all day we were getting racially abused.\u201d \u201cHis finger did the talking and the walking. That\u2019s a powerful statement,\u201d said McAdam. Feder and Ludbey\u2019s role was vital in capturing the moment, as Channel Seven cameras were pointed elsewhere as Winmar made his famous gesture. \u201cIt was a very courageous and symbolic thing that Winmar did,\u201d said Ludbey, \u201cI was close enough to hear Winmar say \u201cI\u2019m black and I\u2019m proud to be black\u201d and I knew straight away the significance of his brave act.\u201d \u201cPeople forget that words have a big impact,\u201d said Winmar. \u201cThey can lift a person or destroy a person. So that day I responded by saying to those people, and I still say it today: \u2018I\u2019m black and I\u2019m proud\u2019.\u201d The rest of us should be thankful that Ludbey and Feder were on hand to capture the moment. 3. The Tied Test Sometimes a great sports image is all about timing and luck, as was the case with Ron Lovitt\u2019s era- defining shot of the final thrilling moments of Brisbane\u2019s Tied Test during the 1960-61 series between Australia and the West Indies. His image of Ian Meckiff being run out by Joe Solomon to end the game is one of cricket\u2019s most enduring and captured in a single frame the invigorating spirit in which both sides played that summer under their adventurous captains, Richie Benaud and Frank Worrell. Lovitt arrived at the ground that day with 36 negatives and once the tense and final 8-ball over came around he only had one left. Another photographer, Bob Barnes of the Courier Mail, had been more frugal and had six remaining so the pair struck a deal to combine forces in the hope of capturing an historic moment. Barnes snapped the first six balls of the over. Lovitt, keeping his composure and not snapping as the Australian pair scrambled a single to tie the scores from the penultimate delivery, then managed to decipher the blur of frantic players to pull the trigger just as Solomon\u2019s throw beat the last-gasp lunge of Meckiff to reach the crease. The photograph is an evocative and thrilling snapshot of one of cricket\u2019s heart-stopping moments. Long shadows creep across the ground and a despairing Lindsay Kline turns to see his partners\u2019 stumps broken as Solomon \u201ctumultuously bullseyes it in a convulsive, conclusive clatter\u201d. Wes Hall raises his arms in hope and desperation while Rohan Kanhai leaps into the air in jubilation. At the bowler\u2019s end only Worrell is not entirely consumed by the excitement, an ocean of calm as he backs up the stumps at the other end. Lovitt\u2019s image, like that famous Test series itself, left us with something visceral and dramatic; it\u2019s a deeply moving suspension of that telling split second, one that not even the greatest scribe could hope to capture in all its perfect minutiae. 4. Summons and Provan \u2013 the Gladiators If every sport deserves its own defining image then the one snapped by John O\u2019Gready of Norm Provan and Arthur Summons as the muddied pair embraced following St George\u2019s eighth successive grand final win is a towering monument to rugby league. The tall, thickset Provan had just captained St George to the famous 1963 grand final victory on a bog patch at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The shot sees the mud-caked second-rower towering over his Western Suburbs opponent Summons in a touching moment of consolation. In that instant Summons is defeated but valiant. He and his opponent are equals on different sides in a tough game. O\u2019Gready was in the perfect position with his hand-held light meter, using his free hand to snap a shot that was to become known as \u201cThe Gladiators\u201d and eventually adorn the NRL\u2019s premiership trophy, a gesture for which Provan was deeply honoured. \u201cIf I drop dead tomorrow I will always be happy with the life rugby league has given me,\u201d he said. \u201cI am immensely pleased with it and it will sink in later how much it means.\u201d Summons described the shot as \u201cmiraculous, a moment of inspiration frozen in time\u201d. Ironically, at the time the shot was taken Summons was actually complaining about the refereeing and telling Provan that his side was lucky to escape with a win. Another of O\u2019Gready\u2019s images that day, shows Provan being chaired from the ground by teammatesand another is a close-up of his muddied face. Fittingly, Summons took time last year at the unveiling of the new NRL trophy named in his honour to remember O\u2019Gready and his contribution to the moment. \u201cUnfortunately the great photographer who took the picture isn\u2019t here to share this moment with us because, without him, we\u2019d have been forgotten 50 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThat poor soul ran up and down the sideline with mud up to nearly his knees.\u201d \u201cHe was in a suit and had his pants tucked into his socks. He was an incredible man and it\u2019s a pity he wasn\u2019t here to enjoy the accolades that rugby league is now giving to Norm and I. 5. Jack Johnson at Rushcutters Bay Where to start with the 1908 world heavyweight title fight between Canada\u2019s Tommy Burns and African-American fighter Jack Johnson? With US and European promoters having put a \u201ccolour bar\u201d in place to prevent black boxers from challenging white champions, Sydney promoter Hugh McIntosh seized upon the opportunity to bring heayweight title-holder Burns and \u2018coloured\u2019 champion Johnson to Sydney in order to settle the title. The enormity of the moment, with 20,000 men (women were not allowed in) crammed into a hastily constructed timber stadium in Rushcutters Bay, is captured stunningly in the famous panoramic photo by the Charles Kerry Studio. It shows the entourage of Johnson, a slave\u2019s son from Texas, and that of the Canadian having entered the ring before the fight. Johnson\u2019s brutal win and the accompanying film footage, which travelled the world thereafter, were the start of his seven-year reign as the world\u2019s best at a time when he faced unimaginable prejudice in his own country. The fight, also immortalised in a watercolour by Norman Lindsay, took place on the land of the Gadigal people and speaking at the 100th speaking at the 100th anniversary celebrations, Gadigal representative Brad Cooke said: \u201cJack Johnson\u2019s defeat of Tommy Burns marks a great moment for Black people all over the world for it provided an opportunity for the black man to be of equal standing to the white man and in this case prove to be a greater man in boxing.\u201d A mere five years after the fight Jerry Jerome became Australia\u2019s first Aboriginal national champion. Though incomplete footage survives of the bruising, almost farcical 14-round encounter (it was refereed by the promoter himself), it is Kerry\u2019s panorama that gives perhaps the greatest sense of the atmosphere that surrounded the fight, with onlookers crammed into every inch of the stadium. 6. Jesaulenko\u2019s mark Taking place in perhaps the greatest of all Grand Finals, Alex Jesaulenko\u2019s spectacular mark over Graeme \u201cJerker\u201d Jenkin in 1970 is emblematic of the most thrilling aspects of Australian Rules Football. It\u2019s famous for caller Mike Williamson\u2019s cry of \u201cJesaulenko, you beauty!\u201d. But Jesaulenko himself believes that the photographers played a vital part in making it a perennial favourite. \u201cThe images make it look classical, like it was taken from the marking manual,\u201d said Jesaulenko. \u201cGraeme\u2019s a six-foot-four ruckman, I guess there\u2019s a mystique in standing on top of him with your arms outstretched.\u201d There are four distinct versions of the moment. Rennie Ellis\u2019 lesser-known wide-angle colour shot from low on the ground is a thing of beauty and perhaps now benefits from far less exposure than the others. Clive McKinnon\u2019s picture for The Sun shows Jesaulenko\u2019s outstretched hands about to mark the ball while Dennis Bull\u2019s example in The Age shows Jesaulenko as he begins to grasp the ball in his hands. Perhaps best of all is Bruce Howard\u2019s image showing the high-flying Blue finally clutching the ball to his chest. Amazingly, the latter three might have missed the famous shot when in the moments leading up to the mark, Bull fumbled in his pocket for some Minties, offering them to his colleagues. McKinnon told The Herald Sun. \u201cI noticed Jezza getting a bit excited as the ball started coming back his way. I told Dennis, don\u2019t be stupid, of course I don\u2019t want a mint, then decided to take one. Then I looked up and yelled out \u2018look out, the ball\u2019s coming back!\u2019.\u201d Without the aid of rapid-fire shutters, each man had only one shot to capture the moment and all managed to pull it off with aplomb. \u201cWe were shaking each other\u2019s hands, someone in the member\u2019s yells out \u2018did you get the shot?\u2019, and then the member\u2019s all start applauding \u2013 not applauding Jezza, they were applauding us for getting the shot,\u201d remembered McKinnon. \u201cWe almost didn\u2019t get it because we were playing with Minties.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
