After seeing her team reach the final of last year's European Championship and remain undefeated throughout the 10-match qualifying campaign for the World Cup finals, Powell says she has no fears about any of the 16 nations at the tournament in Germany next June. \"I'll be happy with whoever we get drawn against in the group stage,\" said Powell, for whom this will be a second World Cup in charge after England failed to reach both the 1999 and 2003 finals. \"Other teams are now looking at us as tough opponents. We weren't considered in that way before we reached the 2007 quarter-finals in China but, with the progress we've made since then, we're being shown a lot more respect and we're getting used to winning. \"It would be stupid to say we're going to win the World Cup but we'll set realistic targets and, if we get a bit of luck with the draw \u2013 as we did at the Euro finals last year \u2013 then as long as we stay focused and injury-free we should be capable of making decent progress at what I think will be a fantastic tournament.\" Freezing conditions around the country put paid to all of today's Premier League and League Cup matches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
