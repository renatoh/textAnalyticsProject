He described the conditions in an official blog post, his first since the change of government. It comes in response to the coalition's imposition of a moratorium on new projects worth more than \u00a31m and a review of existing projects as part of its effort to reduce public spending. Suffolk said projects may be allowed to go ahead only if some of the following conditions apply: - the new contract needs to be approved to achieve value for money as a delay could have negative consequences; - a delay would stop or directly impact delivery of a service that is consistent with government priorities; - the project or programme delivers a mandated legislative requirement where there is no flexibility on end date and its delivery would be jeopardised by a delay; - a delay would put an SME supplier in danger of collapse, although the contract would still have to represent good value for money. Exceptions can only be approved by the Cabinet Office minister advised by the government CIO. The freeze applies to all contracts and projects where ICT is a key element, and extends to contract amendments and extensions, pilot projects, feasibility studies and proof of concept projects. No new tender notices can be issued, although projects for a few areas such as the Olympics and specialist defence have already been excluded. Suffolk also provided detail on the plan to review all core ICT projects. For those worth more than \u00a350m, the Major Projects Review Team will conduct an in-depth review, while for those with a lower value departments will be responsible. They will look at factors such as the delivery record and whether they could be done in a different or more cost-effective way. He said that for projects that are decommissioned it may be possible to move officials, if their skills match, into roles currently held by interims, consultants and contractors. Those that the government thinks should be subject to a contract renegotiation will be handled by Suffolk's team, the Office of Government Commerce, departmental commercial directors, chief information officers and legal specialists. Suppliers may want to talk about standardising or reducing requirements, or looking at different approaches to structuring teams or risk transfer to reduce costs, he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
