Only if City dominate for another 10 years\u2019", "bodyText": "Almost a decade after his arrival marked a new era in English football, Vincent Kompany is in a good position to make a judgment. Having started his career at Anderlecht, the future Manchester City captain was a fresh-faced 22-year-old when he was purchased from Hamburg at the end of August 2008 by Mark Hughes, the first of a total of 78 signings totalling more than \u00a31bn that have transformed the club since Sheikh Mansour\u2019s takeover that summer. As a result, with Pep Guardiola\u2019s vibrant team turning heads around Europe as they prepare to face Manchester United in the most significant derby for years, Kompany is by now well-versed in answering the city\u2019s perennial question. \u201cA shift in power? I\u2019d like to see us dominate for another 10 years,\u201d he says. As the son of a political refugee from Zaire who became a diplomat, and with a mother who was a trade-union leader in Brussels, Kompany has never been afraid to voice an opinion. He established himself as City\u2019s captain within two seasons of joining and has since led them to two Premier League titles, two League Cups and an FA Cup, enabling the \u201cnoisy neighbours\u201d to overtake United in the years since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. But at 31 and with a list of injuries (18) that exceeds the number of goals he has scored in a sky-blue shirt (16), the Belgium defender knows he can take nothing for granted as the final year of his contract approaches. \u201cI have been a part of trying to turn this club around. When I signed for City we were out and about in town a lot because we weren\u2019t the big dogs in the city,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s changed a bit now. We\u2019re now more like an international club, but it wasn\u2019t like that when I signed. When the owners came to Manchester City they decided they wanted to make this club a huge club in England. At the same time, there was a huge gap left when Ferguson left United. \u201cIt\u2019s been a case that as one Manchester club was going through a rebuilding phase, we were in the ascendancy. But one thing I would like to say, touching on Ferguson, is that it is absolutely normal that when a person has had such a big influence on a club for such a long time, there will always be a big rebuilding job to do once he has left. \u201cThat\u2019s why I am reluctant to say there has been a shift in power. I\u2019m not defending United. They have made a huge investment to try to close the gap on us and fill the void left by Ferguson. But it is normal that it would take them a few years to steady the ship once he left.\u201d Eight points separate the two rivals at the top of the table going into Sunday\u2019s meeting at Old Trafford, with City aiming to match Arsenal\u2019s record of 14 successive Premier League victories. Kompany will face a late fitness test after withdrawing from the team that went on to lose to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League on Wednesday, because of an injury he sustained in the warm-up in Ukraine. Having already missed almost three months of the campaign following yet another calf problem, his desire to be involved in Guardiola\u2019s all-conquering team is clear. \u201cThe first thing you feel [when you are injured] is: \u2018I want to be a part of it. I want to be a part of this\u2019. And as soon as the game finishes you\u2019re thinking: \u2018I need to train, I need to do something, I need to somehow get myself back on track to participate\u2019,\u201d Kompany says. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a great sense of motivation you get out of it. What I have learned over the years, and this could help a lot of players when they go through an injury spell, is that you can still improve when you\u2019re injured, even if you\u2019re not on the pitch or lacing up your boots. \u201cJust by visualising and imagining yourself in certain situations and that idea of doing the movements, the defending, I think that\u2019s the key as to why I\u2019ve always been able to slot right back in even though I\u2019ve not been playing for a month, two months. I\u2019ve just visualised myself among the lads so many times doing it and if the physical aspect of it is OK you come back and realise you have made improvements.\u201d With John Stones absent until the new year, City\u2019s achilles heel at the back could yet be exposed should their captain face another spell on the sidelines. A United side deprived of the suspended Paul Pogba may not be the best-equipped to take advantage, although Kompany remains wary of the threat posed by his compatriot Romelu Lukaku despite his recent barren run in front of goal. Kompany is also at pains to warn against any complacency should they emerge with the points. This is still City, after all. \u201cWe haven\u2019t won anything. For all it is worth, we are just a few points ahead of them and that is it. Everything else, the style and how we play and how we get the results, it won\u2019t matter until we have some silverware to show for it. So until then, I wouldn\u2019t be worried if I was another club. If we start winning stuff consistently and in two or three years\u2019 time we are having the same discussion, it is a different debate then. But not at the moment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
