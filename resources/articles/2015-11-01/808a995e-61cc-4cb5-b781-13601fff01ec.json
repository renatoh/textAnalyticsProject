But even when The Returned feels ever so slightly underbaked, its creators still find a way of dropping a revelation with whopping great implications. Just who are you, Victor/Louis, and where \u2013 or perhaps when \u2013 have you come from? \u2018You must help us\u2019 For once, we get a flashback that doesn\u2019t take place 35 years ago: instead we\u2019re whisked a decade back into the past, to witness the death of Esther, a bank worker and victim of Serge\u2019s serial-killing spree. Why are we revisiting another of the horrible underpass murders? Well, this one is different because it features Victor, who warns Esther of her fate just as Serge pounces. Already we know that Victor returned before the others \u2013 he was responsible for the coach crash that killed Camille, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll recall, but this is the earliest we\u2019ve seen him pop up in undead form. Or at least that\u2019s what we thought, until an ailing Mr Lewanski reveals something of a shocker to Julie. Victor isn\u2019t his son; instead he wandered in from the night and into the Lewanskis\u2019 house and made himself part of the family, just as he did with Julie. The ramifications of this are, of course, enormous, and the questions many. Just who are Victor\u2019s parents? What time period is he from? When did he die? And after he was shot by Pierre 35 years ago, did he simply \u201creturn\u201d all over again? I think it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a leap to guess that Mr Lewanski secretly took care of Victor in the years after the break-in, making sure not to reveal his identity to the rest of the townspeople (he hid Victor\u2019s drawings behind a wardrobe, remember). Beyond that, I\u2019m thoroughly stumped about Victor\u2019s true identity. Back in the present, the little tyke is still on the trail of Julie, guided by his terrifying hallucinations. We get more of those this week, including one of Lucy telling him \u201cYou must help us\u201d just as Julie hurls herself into the abyss. (Presumably Lucy, clued-up leader of the undead that she is, knows a fair bit more about who/what Victor is than we do.) Victor\u2019s having less luck finding Julie outside of his hallucinations, particularly now he has been found by Pierre\u2019s goons, Frederic and Lucho. Their decision to take out Costa was an unwise one: Lucho, the one who shot her, takes his life shortly after by leaping from the high-rise window, a decision which you can\u2019t help but think Victor \u2013 who has history in making people do things against their will \u2013 had a hand in. So now Victor, providing he comes quietly, is off to the Helping Hand to join Audrey. We get a glimpse of the unpleasantness Pierre and co have been inflicting on their latest project, with Audrey\u2019s face covered in severe cuts. (\u201cWe must find their weak point\u201d, Pierre says, ominously.) Sandrine\u2019s belief that the person in the basement isn\u2019t actually her daughter but some sort of subhuman doppleganger was always likely to waver once she saw her in pain, and Sandrine ends the episode by forcing her way into Audrey\u2019s makeshift cell. An escape is on the cards. \u2018It\u2019s like you\u2019ve been given a second chance\u2019 Meanwhile, Serge and Toni are still entertaining an unmanageable number of houseguests in the form of the silent women, so they attempt to thin their numbers by returning one, the aforementioned Esther, to her family. It proves harder than they envisaged, mainly because Esther would rather return to the tunnel where Serge killed her. His apology finally breaks Ester\u2019s spell of muteness - will Serge have to do the same to the rest of the silent women? \u2013 and she asks where \u201cthe little boy\u201d is. Why does she want to find Victor, and might it have something to do with Lucy\u2019s request for help in his dream? Milan\u2019s talking too, though not in a way that any of the military, who freed him from his watery prison, can make sense of. \u201cI lost her. I love her. I never told her,\u201d he says, presumably referring to Lucy, who he uttered similar sentiments to a few weeks back. Is this a kinder, gentler Milan we\u2019re seeing? I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. \u2018If you love her, why kill yourself?\u2019 Also resurfacing, though looking a little worse for wear than Milan, is Thomas. The discovery of him in the forest, rotten and with a pole through his chest, means that all the police are now accounted for (and ruling out the prospect of Laure having survived, it seems). Adele goes to visit Thomas \u201cto feel his presence\u201d but doesn\u2019t get a chance to glimpse the body. Instead she\u2019s confronted by what is probably best described as an apparition of her former husband, who tells her that Simon was responsible for his unhappy demise. This seems unlikely, though not impossible, which makes me wonder if this apparition is some manifestation of the darkest corners of Adele\u2019s psyche, the part that mistrusts her former lover. Adele has good reason to mistrust Simon, if Lucy\u2019s words are anything to go by. \u201cNo one could hurt Adele like you did,\u201d she tells him during a confrontation at the church, pointing out that his suicide is a clear sign that he never really cared for her. Lucy surely knows the truth behind Simon\u2019s death, having presumably read his thoughts as she slept with him, but is she telling the truth about his suicide? When exactly are we going to find out the circumstances behind Simon\u2019s death? Over in the village of the undead, there\u2019s concern about the wellbeing of Claire. Camille reveals that she didn\u2019t actually get beaten unconscious by the horde earlier in the season, but instead beat herself into unconsciousness. \u201cThey surrounded us but didn\u2019t come near,\u201d Camille says. Did the horde cause Claire to imagine the attack? Whatever the case may be, it seems a good time for the family to leave deadsville. It\u2019s a stroke of luck then that Jerome and Berg turn up just in time to help them make their escape. As the group ventures on to the street they come to face to face, once again, with the horde. Notes and theories If Claire hallucinated the horde attacking her, could she have done the same with Virgil when she caught him with Camille? He seemed to have a very large knife, but when the camera cut away it was suddenly gone. We know that Serge died seven years before coming back, and the murder of Esther happened 10 years ago, so Serge\u2019s reign of terror must have lasted at least three years. The water is finally going down in the lake. Meanwhile Berg and Jerome encounter another big hole on the outskirts of the forest. There was a thick layer of frost at Serge and Toni\u2019s cabin, which suggests it must be the beginnings of winter in Returned-ville. But then, do we ever get the sense of what the seasons are in this strange place?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
