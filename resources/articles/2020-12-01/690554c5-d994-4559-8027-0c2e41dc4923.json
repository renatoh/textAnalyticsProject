Figures obtained by the NSW upper house Greens MP David Shoebridge show the amount paid to settle claims against officers each year dwarfs the official sums reported by NSW police. In the past four financial years police in the state have settled more than 1,000 civil cases. The settlements cover a sweeping range of misconduct claims, including unlawful searches, illegal arrests, false imprisonment, assault and harassment. The figure includes legal costs as well as damages paid to plaintiffs. The cost of the payments to taxpayers has never dropped below $20m a year, peaking at $32.6m in 2016-17. In the past four years NSW police have handed out $113.5m to settle claims. \u201cSince the Coalition came to power in 2011, the NSW Police have paid hundreds of millions in hush payments to people who have [allegedly] experienced unlawful searches, illegal arrest, assault and other police misconduct,\u201d Shoebridge told Guardian Australia. But the details of almost all the cases remain secret, thanks to the widespread use of confidentiality clauses in settlement deeds. The clauses prevent victims discussing the terms of the settlement and the amount paid. Some plaintiffs opt to have the clauses inserted into settlements but lawyers say that in cases involving allegations of officer misconduct the vast majority are driven by police. Peter O\u2019Brien, a lawyer who specialises in civil cases against the police, said the insistence on confidentiality clauses was often used as leverage in negotiating a settlement. \u201cThe police often have a commercial incentive to have a confidentiality clause in place, and in those matters there becomes a value attached to it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn cases where we\u2019re saying, \u2018Well, we don\u2019t want a confidentiality clause, we want to tell everyone and sundry about this,\u2019 and the police are not happy with that, we\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, what\u2019s it worth to you? If you want us to keep quiet about it, pay us for it.\u2019 That\u2019s the way it often works.\u201d David Marocchi, the founding partner of Sydney law firm Paramount Lawyers, said the clauses were \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of a settlement and could be beneficial if clients did not want the details of their case made public. But, he said, taxpayers had a right to know \u201cwhat it is costing the state\u201d to fund police cases. Marocchi was critical of delays in processing claims, which he believed were often exacerbated by the use of private law firms to run cases for the government. \u201cThey\u2019ve already got a reserve on the value of the settlement but they won\u2019t give you that offer until six or 10 months later when you\u2019re on the doorstep of the courthouse. That\u2019s the reality. \u201cThey get paid every time they open the file or refer to the case, and in my view that part of it should be reviewed because it is quite embarrassing.\u201d\u201c In a statement, a spokeswoman for NSW police did not answer questions about the use of confidentiality agreements in settlements, but said the figures reported to parliament \u201crelate to all costs\u201d incurred during cases \u201cincluding defence legal costs, court costs, plaintiff legal costs when paid by the State and damages amounts\u201d. \u201cFigures supplied to the Legislative Council also include matters where the State either successfully defends a matter at hearing or settles in its favour,\u201d she said. But Shoebridge was critical of the use of confidentiality agreements by a government body, saying a lack of transparency around settlements meant only a tiny portion of cases against police were ever made public. \u201cAround 300 people are suing the police each year for alleged misconduct and in the most recent year reported only eight of these went to court,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2019-20 a total of eight cases were taken to court, representing only 2.7% of the 298 cases brought against them. The rest were settled behind closed doors, almost all with binding secrecy provisions.\u201d Marocchi acted in a high-profile 2019 case against police in which a Sydney man, Steven Attalla, was awarded $112,000 after being illegally strip searched. In that case, he said, lawyers acting for the state made a number of offers in the lead-up to the trial which were \u201cembarrassingly low\u201d. But he and other lawyers who spoke to the Guardian said the Attalla case was an outlier. More commonly, the state is eager to settle cases before they make it to court to avoid trial fees. That appears to be supported in the data obtained by the Greens. Out-of-court settlements massively outweigh the number of misconduct claims that make it to trial. Over the same four-year period, the police paid out about $1.4m as a result of judgments made in courts. O\u2019Brien said the value of out-of-court settlements over the past four years was \u201cparticularly high because the damages awarded in these types of matters are unfortunately low\u201d. The reason for that is complex, and changes depending on the type of case. But O\u2019Brien said the difficulty of pursuing a case against police and the risk of losing carried an incentive for people to settle out of court. He used the example of malicious prosecution, which is one of the three most common types of cases against police, along with assault and false imprisonment. Malice, he said, was \u201cnotoriously hard to prove\u201d in cases against officers. \u201cIncompetence is a defence, so is overzealousness and stupidity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could see why a plaintiff suing the police might be thinking, \u2018Oh goodness, I have the burden of proving to a high standard that police were more likely than not acting with malice against me. How would I do that? What if I lose and there\u2019s a cost order made against me?\u2019 \u201cSo the incentive to accept a settlement which might be seen to be a compromise is very attractive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
