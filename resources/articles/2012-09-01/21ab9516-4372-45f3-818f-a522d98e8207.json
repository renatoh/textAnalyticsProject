Carax's episodic odyssey dazzles and mystifies in equal quantities. Life, death, cinema: it's all interchangeable here, as Lavant cruises Paris in his limousine/mobile dressing room, assuming wildly different roles for unspecified \"clients\". The wheels threaten to come off with every swerve, but it's an occasionally astounding drive on the wild side. Looper (15) (Rian Johnson, 2012, US) Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt. 118 mins As he did with high-school movie Brick, Johnson takes a tired genre into fresh territory here, with a time-travel sci-fi that's smart, original, exciting and destined for cult status. Gordon-Levitt and Willis play young and old versions of the same assassin, with Gordon-Levitt having to either kill his older self or team up with him to bring down a dodgy system. Barbara (12A) (Christian Petzold, 2012, Ger) Nina Hoss, Ronald Zehrfeld, Rainer Bock. 105 mins A subtler take on East German paranoia than The Lives Of Others, with Hoss as a stern doctor, ostracised to the provinces, whose plans of escape to the west are compromised by her thawing attitudes. It's visually and thematically rich, without ever being showy. The Campaign (15) (Jay Roach, 2012, US) Will Ferrell, Zach Galifianakis, Jason Sudeikis. 85 mins More bark than bite to this election satire, in which the two leads put on their familiar comedy personas \u2013 Ferrell in Ron Burgundy mode as a superficially slick congressman, up against Galifianakis's dimwitted corporate stooge. Resident Evil: Retribution (15) (Paul WS Anderson, 2012, US) Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez. 96 mins Milla keeps slaying, but the zombies keep coming \u2013 all the way here to part five, in which, as usual, a band of lycra-clad rebels resist a corporate-controlled apocalypse. Visual spectacle is a given, though it doesn't quite play by Hollywood rules. Cross Of Honour (15) (Peter Naess, 2012, Nor/Swe) Florian Lukas, David Kross, Rupert Grint. 100 mins The second world war in microcosm, as British and German pilots (Ron Weasley included) find themselves stranded together in a snowy Norwegian cabin. The Babymakers (15) (Jay Chandrasekhar, 2012, US) Paul Schneider, Olivia Munn, Kevin Heffernan. 91 mins Has there ever been a good comedy about fertility issues? This certainly isn't it, though its premise of an infertile dad staging a sperm-bank heist offers all the male-genital-related slapstick you could wish for \u2013 and then some. Husbands (12A) (John Cassavetes, 1970, US) Ben Gazzara, Peter Falk, John Cassavetes. 131 mins Three men cut loose after the death of their buddy in this free-flowing to the point of self-indulgent drama. Not the best example of Cassavetes's pioneering, verit\u00e9-style naturalism. Out from Friday Sparkle Jordin Sparks, CeeLo Green and Whitney Houston grace this 1960s Motown-style girl group saga. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower Emma Watson forsakes Hogwarts for a US high-school drama. Out from Wed Taken 2 Liam Neeson has more kidnapping to deal with in this straightforward actioner. Out from Thu Sinister Ethan Hawke plays a crime writer drawn into a supernatural, housebound nightmare. Liberal Arts College life and real life both disappoint in this academic comedy. Everything Or Nothing Docu on the men who built the James Bond franchise. The Knot Yes, another wedding romcom, this one including Noel Clarke and Mena Suvari. Some Guy Who Kills People Horror comedy in which the smalltown loser turns vengeful and homicidal. English Vinglish An Indian mum in New York finds her feet thanks to her multicultural English class.
