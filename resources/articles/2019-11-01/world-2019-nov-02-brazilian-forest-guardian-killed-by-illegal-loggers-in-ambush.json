According to a statement by the Brazilian Indigenous Peoples Association, Paulo Paulino Guajajara was shot and killed inside the Ararib\u00f3ia indigenous territory in Maranh\u00e3o state. Another tribesman, La\u00e9rcio Guajajara, was also shot and hospitalised and a logger has been reported missing. No body has yet been recovered. S\u00e9rgio Moro, the justice minister of far-right president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s government, confirmed that Brazil\u2019s federal police were investigating the killing. \u201cWe will spare no effort to bring those responsible for this serious crime to justice,\u201d he tweeted. The tribesmen are members of an indigenous forest guard called Guardians of the Forest, which formed in 2012 to ward off logging gangs pillaging their rare, hardwood-rich reserve. Their work involves armed patrols and destroying logging encampments and has earned them dangerous enemies. Several Guardians in Maranh\u00e3o have been killed in recent years, including three from Ararib\u00f3ia. According to Gilderlan Rodrigues, Maranh\u00e3o regional coordinator of Brazil\u2019s indigenous missionary council, the murdered tribesman had been threatened several times. \u201cTheir work bothers those that want to loot their territory,\u201d he said, adding that the killers were from a nearby rural settlement and had entered the reserve without permission. \u201cThese criminal actions must be combated so that more lives are not lost.\u201d The 4,130 sq km (1,595 sq miles) Ararib\u00f3ia indigenous reserve is home to an estimated 5,300 indigenous Brazilians of the Guajajara tribe and the Aw\u00e1, an isolated group described as the \u201cworld\u2019s most endangered tribe\u201d. It concentrates much of the last remaining Amazon rainforest in Maranh\u00e3o state. Sarah Shenker, senior research and advocacy officer at Survival International, who knew the murdered tribesman, described it as an \u201cisland of green amid a sea of deforestation\u201d. She said the killing was \u201ca crime foretold\u201d. Earlier this year Paulino told Survival International: \u201cIt makes me so mad to see this [forest destruction]. These people think they can come here, into our home, and help themselves to our forest? No. We won\u2019t allow it. We don\u2019t break into their houses and rob them, do we? My blood is boiling. I\u2019m so angry.\u201d The reserve is officially protected by the Brazilian government but is constantly targeted by logging gangs and has long been a hotbed of violent conflict. In 2015, a former enforcement operations coordinator with Brazil\u2019s environmental agency Ibama, Roberto Cabral, was shot there. In June this year, the Ararib\u00f3ia Guardians\u2019 leader, Ol\u00edmpio Guajajara, recorded a video calling for help from the Brazilian state after reporting that gunmen were being paid to kill them and indigenous houses had been shot at. \u201cWe don\u2019t want war, we want to resist,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want the Brazilian authorities to help protect the lives of the Guardians that are threatened.\u201d The video was sent to the Brazilian government. Few land conflict-related killings in Brazil result in convictions, which advocates say has produced a culture of impunity. According to Brazil\u2019s pastoral land commission, a rural violence watchdog, of 157 land conflict killings in Maranh\u00e3o state between 1985 and 2017, just five cases went to court. Since the beginning of this year, when Bolsonaro took office, observers noted that attacks and invasions of indigenous lands had soared in Brazil as environmental and indigenous protection agencies suffered cuts and interference. \u201cThe indigenous genocide of Brazil is legitimised by the discourse of the president,\u201d said indigenous leader Sonia Bone Guajajara, who is from the Ararib\u00f3ia reserve and is currently in Europe with the campaign Indigenous Blood: Not a Single Drop More."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
