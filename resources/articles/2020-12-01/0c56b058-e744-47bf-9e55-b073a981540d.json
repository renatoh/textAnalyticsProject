The Blades are the only club in England\u2019s top four divisions without a league win this season but no one at Bramall Lane believes relegation is inevitable. When they host Leicester on Sunday, they will attack with the conviction that the goals will soon start to flow for them, even though they have netted four in 10 Premier League matches. David McGoldrick believes that more than anyone and has been using the lessons of his own career to try to inspire the other strikers at the club. McGoldrick is their only player to have scored a league goal from open play this season, but it was a very different story last season, when he did not get off the mark until United\u2019s 35th league match. He reminded his fellow forwards of that after last week\u2019s defeat at West Brom, particularly Oli McBurnie, who has become a target of criticism after a series of missed chances. \u201cI spoke to him straight after the game in the dressing room,\u201d says the 33-year-old. \u201cI don\u2019t really follow social media, but a few boys said there were calls for him to be dropped. But if you take the aspects of his game, what he brings to our club and team, the physical side and so on, he did well. If he had put a few of those chances away it would have been a real good performance. \u201cAs an older figure I tell them [younger strikers]: \u2018Remember me when I was talking about my goal drought last year.\u2019 It\u2019s not about missing chances, it\u2019s when you\u2019re not getting chances that you need to start worrying. All the strikers have had chances and some of them are going to drop in soon, and then hopefully we\u2019ll go on a run.\u201d McGoldrick was given similar advice when he was starting out as a teenager at Southampton. \u201cI missed a few chances in a reserve game and Harry Redknapp [the manager] talked to me, and so did Kevin Phillips, who was the main striker at Southampton at the time and is the best finisher I\u2019ve played with. \u201cHe said when you\u2019re not getting chances you know you\u2019re doing something wrong and you shouldn\u2019t be at this level, but when you are getting chances, getting into positions and getting on the end of things but it\u2019s just not coming off, then you still belong at this level. Oli belongs at this level and he\u2019s going to start scoring again, no doubt about it.\u201d McGoldrick knows the value of going public with that endorsement. He benefited from similar support last season, when his all-round play ensured he retained affection despite errant finishing. \u201cI was getting no real negativity when I was on the pitch and missing chances,\u201d he says. \u201cA couple of games spring to mind: at Brighton I went around the keeper and put it wide and the fans started singing my name. What fans do that? \u201cAt Aston Villa I missed quite a few chances and the fans were singing my name as I was brought off. I saw some of the press conference, what the manager and the boys were saying about me, and as long as I had that backing, that got me through it.\u201d McGoldrick also takes heart from Sheffield United\u2019s record of defying the odds under Chris Wilder, rising from League One to finishing ninth in the top flight. \u201cWe\u2019ve had so much success over the past three years,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the first real down part of our journey since I\u2019ve been here so I don\u2019t think we need to start taking a wrecking ball to things. You can see the system works, we\u2019re creating chances. It\u2019s just the final thing and that comes down to a bit of confidence and bit of luck.\u201d He is convinced there is no question of any of his teammates giving in to despair. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing about this club, you wouldn\u2019t be playing for a Chris Wilder team if you\u2019re attitude wasn\u2019t spot-on. \u201cIt was not until I was 31 that I started playing in the Premier League even though I got signed by a Premier League club when I was 16,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took all these years to get here and I want to stay as long as we can. We will fight tooth and nail to make that happen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
