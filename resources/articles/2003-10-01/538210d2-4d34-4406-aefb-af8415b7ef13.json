He went voluntarily to a central London police station, where he was formally arrested and is being questioned by detectives, police said. \"A 27-year-old man attended a central London police station by appointment where he was arrested in connection with an allegation of rape and sexual assault made by a 17-year-old female. He remains in police custody at this time,\" said a Scotland Yard spokesman. \"It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this stage,\" he said. The girl, a sixth-former at a Catholic school, has told police she agreed to have sex with one man and was then attacked by up to seven others, some of them allegedly Premiership footballers. The attack, in which the girl claims she raped and sexually assaulted, took place in the early hours of September 27, in room 316 of the Grosvenor House Hotel on London's Park Lane. Another man, party organiser Nicholas Meikle, 29, has already been arrested and bailed over the accusations after going voluntarily to a police station yesterday. Mr Meikle, from Catford, south London said he welcomed the police investigation, which he hoped would clear him over the \"groundless\" allegations. Mr Meikle said the girl agreed to have sex with him. He claims she then consented to sex with one of his friends and two Premiership footballers from two different clubs and that at no stage was she raped. He was bailed until later this month while police inquiries continue. The investigation into the girl's claims is being carried out by Scotland Yard's Operation Sapphire team, which handles sex crimes. Rumours about the identities of the football players allegedly involved have flooded the internet and circulated among fans, but the media have so far not published their names."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
