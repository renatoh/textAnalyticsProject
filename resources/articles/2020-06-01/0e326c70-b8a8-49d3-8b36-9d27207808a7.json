The Galaxy announced their decision to \u201cmutually part ways\u201d with their new Serbian winger Friday in a one-sentence news release. Tea Katai made the posts on her Instagram story earlier this week, and the Galaxy angrily condemned them as \u201cracist and violent\u201d on Wednesday. The Instagram posts made by Tea Katai on Tuesday, which have since been deleted, mocked protests related to the killing of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis last week. One image showed a police SUV attempting to drive through protesters in New York. A caption in Serbian read, \u201cKill the shits!\u201d while a second showed a picture of an individual carrying boxes of Nikes with the caption \u201cBlack Nikes Matter\u201d. The Galaxy met with Aleksandar Katai on Thursday. He disavowed his wife\u2019s posts late Wednesday night, saying the \u201cviews are not ones that I share and are not tolerated in my family\u201d. Katai signed with the Galaxy as a free agent on 31 December. Galaxy fans immediately reacted with wide online calls for his dismissal. On Thursday, a handful of fans gathered by the David Beckham statue outside the club\u2019s stadium holding a banner reading \u201cNo Racists in Our Club\u201d along with a circle and a red line through No 7, Katai\u2019s uniform number. The 29-year-old Katai had been participating in voluntary individual workouts this week with his Galaxy teammates at their training complex in Carson. On Thursday, he posted a message on Instagram calling the posts \u201ca mistake from my family\u201d and saying he took full responsibility, apologizing \u201cfor the pain these posts have caused the LA Galaxy family and all allies in the fight against racism\u201d. Although he had played in only two games with his new club before the coronavirus pandemic postponed the MLS season, Katai was expected to be an important part of the Galaxy\u2019s attack this season alongside Javier \u201cChicharito\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez and Cristian Pav\u00f3n. Katai joined MLS with the Chicago Fire in 2018 after a career in Europe, including time with Serbian powerhouse Red Star Belgrade. He had 18 goals in his first two seasons with the Fire, who acquired him from Alav\u00e9s in Spain\u2019s La Liga."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
