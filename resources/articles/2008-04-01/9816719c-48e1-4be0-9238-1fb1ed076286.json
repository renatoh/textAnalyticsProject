In his new opera for Covent Garden, he finally makes the issue the centre of his drama, and in the Minotaur himself, a role specially conceived for the bass John Tomlinson, he has created one of his most complex and fascinating protagonists. \"The beast is vile, so the human goes unloved,\" sings the half-man, half-bull in the death scene that ends the opera, which Birtwistle modelled on Boris Godunov's death scene in Mussorgsky's opera. It is a dramatic tour de force for Tomlinson, who handles it superbly and gives eloquence to a creature who can articulate his thoughts only in his dreams and acquires the power of speech only after the fatal blow has landed. Birtwistle and his librettist, David Harsent, stay remarkably close to the detail of the myth, but, as well as giving an extra dimension to the Minotaur himself, they also give a sharp twist to the relationship between the other protagonists. There is no dewy-eyed love at first sight between Christine Rice's Ariadne and Johan Reuter's Theseus, just a hard-driven bargain; she sees him as the means to escape her island prison, while with her help he can achieve his objective of killing the monster. This narrative is unfolded with great lucidity through Birtwistle's score. A single melodic line snakes through the opera, assuming a variety of guises and hues. The scoring is pungently coloured by cimbalom and saxophone, yet it is always spare and elegant, never overwhelming the voices, and only unleashing the full orchestra forces when the violence of the drama demands it - in the Minotaur's two ritual killings of the first part, and the final slaying of the creature himself. Otherwise, there is a delicacy and transparency that conductor Antonio Pappano shapes quite marvellously. The drama is clearly laid out, too, in Stephen Langridge's production, for which designer Alison Chitty has created a bullring-like lair for the Minotaur himself, around which a crowd adds its chanted commentary to the killings. The production is an outstanding achievement, and performances of the smaller roles are as just impressive as those by Tomlinson, Rice and Reuter; words are wonderfully clear, and Birtwistle's vocal lines are made to seem the most naturally expressive things in the world. \u00b7 Until May 3.
