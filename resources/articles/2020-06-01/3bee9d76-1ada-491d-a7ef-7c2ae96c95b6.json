Almost 1,500 companies, controlled by rich Australians including Perth media billionaire Kerry Stokes, Melbourne packaging clan the Pratts and Sydney\u2019s Belgiorno-Nettis family, are exempt from laws that require other large enterprises to file financial records that are available to the public. For those who want to keep the loophole alive, it\u2019s a valuable privacy measure that helps allay the fears some rich Australians have for their personal safety and let them get on with life outside of the limelight. But to Labor\u2019s shadow assistant minister for treasury, Andrew Leigh, it is, he told parliament during the week, a \u201ccloak of invisibility\u201d for government mates. On each of the four sitting days this week he moved a motion to shut down the loophole. Each time, the government voted it down without debate. It was just the latest in a series of failed attempts to kill the loophole stretching back more than a decade. Leigh told Guardian Australia the loophole was a \u201cbizarre exemption, which really should have disappeared before the Spice Girls appeared on the scene\u201d. \u201cThe idea that it is still protecting 1,500 old firms from playing by the same rules as new start-ups is just abhorrent.\u201d The no-tell club is made up of companies that were already large in 1995 but did not have to file accounts with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission under the law at that time. When new rules were introduced, these firms were allowed to keep their secrecy status \u2013 a move Leigh says gives them an advantage over newer companies. \u201cMany of these firms have substantial turnover, and the idea that a little mum-and-dad startup has to report but a significant private firm formed before 1995 doesn\u2019t have to report is disgraceful,\u201d he says. Andy Schmulow, a senior lecturer in law at the University of Wollongong, says the continued existence of the loophole shows that the Liberal party has \u201cbecome the promoters of crony capitalism\u201d. \u201cWhat this does is it unmasks what I think has become of the Liberal party, and which is similar but not as advanced (in terms of decay) as the US Republican party: they are no longer even the champions of the market,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cFunnily enough in my discussions with one Liberal backbencher, he has relayed to me his fear that Australia is going down the path of crony capitalism.\u201d Within Treasury, Leigh\u2019s view that the existence of the list of what are called \u201cgrandfathered exempt proprietary companies\u201d is an anti-competitive embarrassment has been orthodox thinking since at least 2006. \u201cThe relief granted to grandfathered exempt proprietary companies creates an inconsistent regulatory framework for proprietary companies that potentially gives grandfathered exempt proprietary companies an unfair competitive advantage,\u201d Treasury officials said in a paper calling for submissions to a review of the loophole that year. Since then, community expectations of corporate transparency have only increased, driven in part by revelations of widespread tax dodging by multinational companies and the use of offshore havens by the world\u2019s financial elite. Labor didn\u2019t abolish grandfathering last time it was in power, between 2007 and 2013, even though it was party policy before the 2007 election. Leigh says the party didn\u2019t control the Senate and had a full dance card that included dealing with the global financial crisis and its aftermath. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure if we had the opportunity to remove the loophole easily then, we would have done,\u201d he says. He points to Labor\u2019s decision while in government to publish tax information about companies with incomes of more than $100m a year. This was originally to include family-owned groups, but after complaints that publication of the information might lead to kidnapping, the threshold for those companies was increased to $200m by the incoming Liberal government. \u201cWhen we did that, we had strong public support,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cThe public believe that it\u2019s appropriate to have private firms report to Asic, and these are not tiddlywink firms.\u201d Over the past decade, the value of membership of the grandfathers\u2019 club has been eroded by transparency measures including the corporate tax disclosure laws and the introduction of a new rule requiring extremely large companies, known as \u201csignificant global entities\u201d, to file public financial reports. Members have also dropped off as businesses were sold or companies collapsed. But being a member still has value to the people whose companies continue to make the cut. Jonathan Wenig, a partner at Melbourne law firm Arnold Bloch Leibler \u2013 long the advocates of choice for the city\u2019s discreet elite \u2013 says he agrees that community expectations of transparency have increased. \u201cBut so have community concerns about privacy, concerns which are equally legitimate for all private individuals and families,\u201d he says. He says the depiction of wealth in popular media also \u201cfuelled an even greater desire for privacy\u201d by those who prefer to shun the limelight. \u201cThe type of privacy that would have been a \u2018preference\u2019 40 years ago, is now a jealously guarded priority,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, many of these high net wealth families go to great lengths to avoid the public eye. They have concerns about being the targets of people\u2019s grievances; and yes, they harbour concerns about the safety of their family members. \u201cThe fact that some of the grandfathered companies now have to file anyway is not necessarily an argument for removing the grandfathering \u2013 it\u2019s actually an argument for sustaining the grandfathering, so that the exception will be eroded by the effluxion of time.\u201d While Wenig is happy to defend grandfathering, Leigh says the Morrison government has refused to defend the existence of the loophole. \u201cThey\u2019ve tabled a bit of paper, the contents of which says the reason that we\u2019re voting against it is that closing the loophole was recommended in a 2015 Senate report, and we haven\u2019t yet responded to that report,\u201d he says. A spokesman for the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, says the government is \u201ccommitted to corporate transparency\u201d. \u201cThe government will respond to this recommendation in due course as part of its response to the Senate Economics Committee\u2019s corporate tax avoidance report,\u201d he says. He did not say when that would be. Meanwhile, the law, like the walls and hedges, continues to protect the private affairs of the rich from prying eyes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
