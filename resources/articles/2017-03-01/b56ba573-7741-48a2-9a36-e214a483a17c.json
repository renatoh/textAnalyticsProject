Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s equaliser spared City from another ordeal, on the back of their Champions League exit against Monaco last week, after it had looked as though Guardiola might experience a sixth league defeat in a season for the first time in his managerial career. The draw means City have fewer points than at the corresponding stage of four of the five previous seasons under Manuel Pellegrini and Roberto Mancini but Guardiola said it was one of the proudest moments of a career that has accumulated 22 trophies at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. \u201cYou cannot imagine,\u201d said the man who won two European Cups for Bar\u00e7a. \u201cThis is one of the most special days of my life. After our defeat in the Champions League, for two days we were so, so sad and in the training sessions we didn\u2019t talk too much. We arrived here against Liverpool, who haven\u2019t had European football and had all week to prepare, and how we fight and how we run and how we showed spirit. \u201cToday is one of the happiest days of my life as a manager. I am so proud of my players. We were sad [in midweek] so that is why I am so happy. My players put everything on to the pitch. It is one of the days I am most proud. More than ever I want to help the club \u2013 if they want to stay with me \u2013 and make the next step forward. I came here for three years and I want to stay for three years and next year play better. \u201cThe only thing we didn\u2019t do was score more goals. To achieve the big targets you have to be more clinical. It is not just today, I have thought a lot: \u2018What more can I do to get my players to score goals?\u2019 But in my career I scored 11 goals \u2013 one goal a year \u2013 so what can I say to Sergio [Ag\u00fcero]?\u201d James Milner opened the scoring for Liverpool with a penalty five minutes into the second half and J\u00fcrgen Klopp was clearly disappointed they could not register their sixth win against City in their last seven league meetings. \u201cI thought we could have won,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cThey deserved the goal, of course, but I thought we could have scored more. It is a point and that\u2019s good. Tomorrow I will be happy but in this moment I am a little bit disappointed \u2013 not too much but a little bit. We could have lost and we could have won. I\u2019m not happy in this moment but give me a few hours and I will be happy.\u201d Guardiola, however, emphasised his unhappiness with officials. \u201cMy advice to them is that they have to speak to each other and they have to sit down on the table and review and talk urgently to make this sport better,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened that season is something I have never seen in my life. They have to sit and analyse why this amount of things happen, not [just] in Manchester City games but in all the games.\u201d The City manager was effusive in his praise of John Stones after one of the defender\u2019s better performances. \u201cJohn Stones has more personality than anyone in this room \u2013 more balls than everyone here. I am delighted to have him. With all his huge amount of mistakes, I love him. He is under pressure. The people criticise him. They said he wouldn\u2019t play again. It is not easy to play central defence for this manager but I admire my central defenders.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
