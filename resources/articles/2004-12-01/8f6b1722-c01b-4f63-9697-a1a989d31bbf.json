There are currently no fewer than five different accommodation grading systems in use in the UK (RAC, AA and VisitBritain, VisitScotland and Wales Tourist Board) but tourism authorities plan to replace them with a common star system by 2006. Judgments are currently made on level of service, quality of food, and standard of decor and facilities; the new system will also examine the ambience, experience and lifestyle elements such as spa facilities and unique attractions. Around 45-50 per cent of UK accommodation is now rated. Tom Wright, chief executive of Visit Britain, hopes this will rise to 80 per cent by 2006, and anticipates an eventual Europe-wide standard system."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
