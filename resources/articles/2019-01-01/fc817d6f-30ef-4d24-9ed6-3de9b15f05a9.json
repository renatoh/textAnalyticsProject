Juan Guaid\u00f3 told a rally in Caracas that Maduro \u2013 who began his second six-year term as president on Thursday amid a tempest of international condemnation \u2013 was an illegitimate \u201cusurper\u201d. The 35-year-old politician claimed that he therefore had the constitutional right to assume leadership of the country until fresh elections were held. \u201cWe are going to change things in Venezuela,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 told hundreds of cheering supporters in a speech he called his \u201cdeclaration to the Venezuelan people\u201d. \u201cWe aren\u2019t victims. We are survivors ... and we will lead this country towards the glory it deserves,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 added, calling on the people, the international community and, crucially, Venezuela\u2019s armed forces to support him. Guaid\u00f3, who became president of Venezuela\u2019s national assembly last week, admitted there were no \u201cmagic solutions\u201d to an economic crisis fuelling what the UN calls one of the greatest exoduses in Latin American history. But he called a day of nationwide demonstrations for 23 January to intensify pressure on Maduro before concluding by shouting the rallying cry: \u201cPeople of Venezuela: can we, or can\u2019t we?\u201d \u201c\u00a1S\u00ed, se puede!\u201d the crowd roared back. \u201cYes we can!\u201d The opposition took control of the national assembly in 2015 although it was effectively neutered by Maduro\u2019s controversial creation of a constituent assembly in 2017 that sparked deadly protests. Yesiret M\u00e9ndez, a 20-year-old student who was in the crowd, said she had come to hear Guaid\u00f3\u2019s plan for the future: \u201cAnd I\u2019m ready to take to the streets again if necessary.\u201d Carmen de Jes\u00fas, 70, said she hoped Guaid\u00f3 would be able to take control. \u201cMaduro is usurping the power and the president of the national assembly should take over as an interim president.\u201d There was international support for the move too, with the head of the Organisation of American States tweeting: \u201cWe welcome the assumption of @jguaido as interim President of #Venezuela in accordance with Article 233 of the Political Constitution. You have our support, that of the international community and of the people of Venezuela #OEAconVzla.\u201d But there was also apprehension Guaid\u00f3\u2019s audacious move might backfire, triggering a renewed crackdown on regime opponents. \u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly going to generate some sort of response from the government,\u201d said David Smilde, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group. \u201cThey could dissolve [the national assembly] \u2026 or they could try and arrest opposition leaders or Guaid\u00f3.\u201d Addressing a sympathetic audience of Latin American leftists on Friday afternoon, Maduro mocked his challenger, claiming most Venezuelans did not even know who he was. \u201cIt is a show \u2026 a Hollywood-esque show,\u201d Maduro said, adding: \u201cThe Venezuelan right is hopeless.\u201d Venezuela\u2019s chavista prison minister, Mar\u00eda Iris Varela Rangel, tweeted a more sinister message: \u201cGuaid\u00f3, I\u2019ve already prepared your cell and your uniform, I hope you name your cabinet quickly so I know who is going down with you.\u201d Smilde said Guaid\u00f3\u2019s unexpectedly bold challenge to Maduro was a tactic the most radical members of Venezuela\u2019s opposition had been pushing for. \u201cBut the problem with that is that they have no actual real power: they don\u2019t control the institutions, they don\u2019t control the guns and they don\u2019t control the money.\u201d One Guaid\u00f3 ally told the energy news agency Argus Media he was aware of the \u201clife-threatening\u201d risks of his statement: \u201c[But] keeping silent and not invoking the constitution\u2019s authority to strip Maduro of his executive powers would have been a surrender to the dictatorial status quo and would have buried any chance of restoring democracy for years to come.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
