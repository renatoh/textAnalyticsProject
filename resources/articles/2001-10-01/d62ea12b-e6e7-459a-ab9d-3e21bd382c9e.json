Part of the same generation of Russian musicians as Maxim Vengerov and Evgeny Kissin, Repin's technical and interpretive brilliance have earned him a similarly exalted reputation. But his performance of Brahms's Violin Concerto with the Philharmonia under Vassily Sinaisky demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of his musical approach. His steely assurance was perfectly suited to the pyrotechnics of the finale. Each note of Brahms's daunting passage-work was articulated with laser-like accuracy. He transformed this genial movement, with its influences from Hungarian folk music, into a monumental achievement. Impressive down to the last detail of his phrasing, this was a completely commanding performance. Yet there was something curiously remote about Repin's interpretation, nowhere more so than in the first movement. Maybe he was trying to emphasise the dark colours that lie beneath the surface of this outwardly sunny work. But his metallic tone sounded simply hard-edged, and Brahms's lyricism was forced and constrained. And his performance of the enormous cadenza was technically loose and musically diffuse. There's no doubting Repin's strength and stamina as a soloist. But these extraordinary qualities do not automatically translate into musical insight. At least the Philharmonia revealed the subtleties of Brahms's orchestration. Sinaisky sculpted the return to the main theme superbly, as the music grew from the depths of the orchestra to a triumphant fanfare. The conductor, who was replacing an indisposed Yevgeny Svetlanov, also inspired the Philharmonia to produce its most warm-hearted playing in the second act of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. From the filigree delicacy of the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy to the grandeur of the Waltz of the Flowers, the players conjured Tchaikovsky's fantastic menagerie with vivid immediacy."}, "isHosted": false}}}
