Embodying a very Milanese combination of stylish prosperity and tasteful design, it is a favourite destination for the area\u2019s creative elite and the discreetly wealthy. Tucked away in a corner, Pierluigi Dialuce is explaining why, if a political nightmare unfolds in the rest of Italy, the city he has made his home will be able to cope. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that the country is heading for a moment when the hard right and Matteo Salvini take power,\u201d he says, \u201cPerhaps in an alliance with the Brothers of Italy party. We\u2019re talking Viktor Orb\u00e1n-style politics at that point. But Milan will stay as it is. There\u2019s too much money here for that not to be the case. And then we will be even more different from the rest of Italy. But that\u2019s fine by me. Better that way, in fact.\u201d Dialuce is a thirtysomething financial consultant with one of the myriad multinational organisations that have made Milan a service hub for international capital. He grew up in Rome, but came north 13 years ago to read economics at the famous Bocconi University. For a while he worked for Barclays bank and then had a few brief spells abroad. Now he intends to stay in Italy\u2019s richest, most cosmopolitan city. \u201cThis place has changed enormously in recent years. It\u2019s much more international,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much investment and there\u2019s so much culture going on. Stuff that you won\u2019t find in the rest of Italy. The \u2018Milanese\u2019 don\u2019t exist anymore. Milan is made up of the professionals who have come here because there are opportunities that don\u2019t exist back home. They\u2019re the best of Italy. It\u2019s a kind of natural selection that goes on, creating a community which is much more European, open and tolerant in its mindset. Milan is not Italy.\u201d Dialuce\u2019s confidence is borne out by a poll carried out last year which found that 85% of residents would not wish to live anywhere else, while 81% believed that their city should be seen as an economic role model to emulate. But while the likes of Paris, Amsterdam, Munich and Berlin might reasonably aspire to compete with Milan, the rest of Italy, after 20 years of economic stagnation, can only dream. Milan now moves in its own orbit, reaping rich rewards from an economy centred on finance, tech, design and innovation. It\u2019s become fashionable as well as rich. In 2020, the city will host the World Cities Culture Summit. In 2026, the Winter Olympics will be based here, shared with the Alpine town of Cortina. Unprecedented levels of foreign investment are driving new developments across the city. Over 40 major construction projects worth $21bn will be undertaken over the next 15 years. The left-of-centre mayor, Giuseppe Sala, has presided over a 50% rise in tourism based on aggressive promotion of the city\u2019s cultural assets, from the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci to the attractions of the city\u2019s thriving LGBT quarter in Porta Venezia. Only the city\u2019s two football teams, Internazionale and AC Milan, have failed to keep up with the city\u2019s pace of growth and development, though Inter, now under Chinese ownership, lie a respectable second in the national championship. And the more the money flows in, the more ambitious and talented young Italians arrive, and the more foreign investors bet on the future. Across the city monuments to prosperity have sprung up such as Zaha Hadid\u2019s \u201ctwisting tower\u201d, which overlooks a park and gated communities of luxury condominiums designed by Hadid, Daniel Libeskind and the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. Welcome to Milan, a truly global city. But, as elsewhere in Europe, this metropolitan success story is coming at a high price. Last May the Centre for European Reform, a Brussels-based thinktank, published a paper entitled The Big European Sort? The diverging fortunes of Europe\u2019s regions. The \u201csort\u201d refers to a sifting process that is steadily transforming the demography of EU member states, and driving the polarisation that increasingly defines politics in Europe and beyond. The post-industrial city, say the study\u2019s authors, is a success story based on the clustering of high-end services in the great metropolises. \u201cIn the 1980s and 90s,\u201d they write, \u201cindustrial heartlands such as the Ruhr in Germany suffered from relative \u2013 and in some cases absolute \u2013 decline in industrial output. The largest cities \u2013 often capitals such as Paris or London \u2013 were able to replace a declining industrial production with high-value services.\u201d By the 21st century, these reinvented metropolises needed a new kind of population, which was \u201cyounger, more highly educated and richer than Europeans who live in less successful cities and towns,\u201d the report says. \u201cLess successful places are losing people, especially in countries with ageing demographics.\u201d The consequence, the report concludes, is a damaging divide between ageing towns and rural areas and the great cities. \u201cThe political effects of regional sorting are predictable: frustration at relative economic decline in poorer regions, a sense of loss of community as younger people leave, and grievance about metropolitan \u2018elites\u2019 running the country for their own benefit.\u201d These themes have also preoccupied thinkers such as Christophe Guilluy and Guillaume Faburel in France. Both are geographers, reflecting the new reality that the politics of place is becoming as important as class, race and gender in understanding the signs of turbulent times. Guilluy, the author of La France p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, is a trenchant critic of what he describes as 21st century \u201ccitadels\u201d, which have become the \u201cshop window of happy globalisation\u201d. Superstar cities, he argues, are the preserve of an inner-city elite, whose everyday needs are catered for by a low-paid precariat, living on the peripheries of the urban sprawl. \u201cThe traditional working classes no longer live where the good jobs and wealth are created,\u201d says Guilluy. Having grown up in Milan, Prof Roberto Camagni has watched it boom in recent years with a mixture of admiration and trepidation. Camagni is a professor of urban economics at the Politecnico di Milano. \u201cI thought it would peak, but it keeps on going,\u201d he says. He has calculated that between 2000 and 2016, Milan increased its share of Italy\u2019s gross domestic product by an astonishing 17.7%. Only four other cities registered increases, and the next highest was Rome at 4.4%. Everywhere else lost out as the country\u2019s economy flatlined. \u201cIt was big cities like Milan, not nation states, which benefited most from the great wave of integration that came with the European single market,\u201d Camagni says. \u201cThe city provides financiers, lawyers, designers, artists, culture, everything required to be a modern international hub. It has a monopoly on the high-end services that command the highest prices, and the rest of Italy has to pay those prices. In fashion it sits on top of a long global chain that has low-paid garment workers in Vietnam at the bottom. The problem is that this miracle in Milan only really involves the million or so people at its very heart. The city has shaken off the industrial hinterland that made it great in the 20th century. In the end this creates a problem of dignity for other places.\u201d Places like Melzo, for example. The small Lombard town lies about 12 miles north-west of Milan and no more than 20 minutes away on the train. Leaving the station, travellers are confronted by a stretch of wasteland and a huge, crumbling monument to a distinguished past, when Melzo\u2019s dairy industry enjoyed national fame. This melancholy edifice is what remains of the famous old Galbani offices, the HQ of the firm producing the original Bel Paese cheese at the beginning of the 20th century. Abandoned in the mid-80s, it has, say locals, become a public health hazard. The industrial ruins serve to underline the sense of a loss of vocation in a proud town, where the metalworking industry has also disappeared. In the summer metalworkers from Melzo were among thousands of demonstrators in Milan, protesting against the possible loss of 2,000 steelworking jobs in Lombardy. Deindustrialisation has turned Melzo into a dormitory town. Antony Bottani works as a lab technician for a firm producing chemical products 15 miles away. Now on the verge of retirement, he was born and grew up in Melzo. \u201cThe town has lost a lot of its life,\u201d he says sadly. \u201cBig firms like Galbani were powering ahead here and the town thrived. That\u2019s all gone and much of the countryside around here is now used for agri-tourism, not farming, so there aren\u2019t the jobs on the land. And the town is getting older and older.\u201d Bottani\u2019s son Gabriele is 18 and goes to college in the nearby town of Gorgonzola. \u201cHe\u2019s studying IT,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully that way he\u2019ll find work in Milan. But it\u2019s not good the way that towns like Melzo are going. This used to be a Communist town in the old days. Now it\u2019s become a town of the right. People want change. They\u2019re pissed off.\u201d In last May\u2019s European elections Milan voted for the Democratic party. The rest of Lombardy voted for Salvini\u2019s League. Afterwards Pietro Bussolati, a Milanese Democratic party official on Lombardy\u2019s regional council, sat down with colleagues and drew up a novel map of metropolitan Milan. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just of the city,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut also of the surrounding area. What we found was that the proportion of centre-left votes in a place was directly related to the availability of fast means of transport to Milan itself. In all the places where people didn\u2019t have that, and frequent contact with Milan was more difficult, the vote went to the centre-right. \u201cIn my opinion this is not about salaries; it\u2019s about how much direct knowledge one has of how innovation and openness help bring about economic growth. The more you can see that the universities, the research institutes and openness to the rest of the world bring about opportunities you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have, the more you are likely to vote centre-left and express liberal values. And by the same token, the less you see of that, the more likely you are to fall for myths about migrants who steal and so on, and vote for the League.\u201d Nevertheless, Bussolati is realistic enough to concede that better transport links will not truly bridge the yawning economic and cultural divide between Europe\u2019s flourishing mega-cities and angry towns. \u201cThere is no rabbit to pull out of the hat which can solve a problem which has been developing for years,\u201d he says. \u201cThe future is going to be less and less about nation states and more and more about the great cities. They have the wealth of the future in their hands. The goal has to be to make sure that wealth doesn\u2019t just stay in those cities but is dispersed outside the city gates. This is the massive priority for the global left: how to manage the future growth of the great cities.\u201d The new CityLife district of Milan last year acquired its most high-profile occupant, when Chiara Ferragni, Italy\u2019s famous fashion blogger and influencer, moved into a Hadid-designed penthouse with a view of Isozaki\u2019s Allianz tower as well as a glimpse of the Duomo. The luxury development has been built on the site of the old trade and design fairs that attracted presidents, popes and film stars to Milan throughout the last century. An exhibition of photographs tells the story of Milan\u2019s industrial past. It also features a quote from the Finnish-American architect Gottlieb Eliel Saarinen: \u201cAlways design a thing by considering its context \u2013 a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city.\u201d In this age of superbia for Europe\u2019s booming cities, it is tempting to add: \u201cA city in a region, and a region in a country.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 November 2019 because an earlier version incorrectly stated that next year the international book fair traditionally held in Turin is transferring to Milan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
