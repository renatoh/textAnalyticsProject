In the TV industry, where success can lead to overnight fame and fortune, it can be a career-making opportunity. Graham Norton is now one of the BBC's best-paid stars. He made his reputation on Channel 4 hosting his own Friday night show, but his big break came when he took over Five's nightly chat show, The Jack Docherty Show, while the Scottish comic was on holiday. Norton outshone the full-time host; Channel 4 offered him a contract almost before his stand-in period had ended. Docherty's show was pulled soon afterwards. The Big Breakfast's Kelly Brook famously chose Liza Tarbuck as her holiday replacement, but effectively ended her own stint on the show by doing so. Brook had stuttered in front of the cameras and failed to recreate the on-screen chemistry between her predecessor Denise van Outen and co-presenter Johnny Vaughan. Tarbuck sparkled, and Brook was 'let go' by the producers a few weeks later. Tarbuck went on to mainstream TV success, landing acting roles and presenting ITV's You've Been Framed, although Brook's career has also prospered. Natasha Kaplinsky's first experience of prime-time presenting came when she anchored Sky News's coverage of the Selby rail crash. She was a junior news reader at the time, but handled Sky's coverage of the disaster creditably. That brought her to the attention of BBC bosses, and she was poached. Comedian Sacha Bara Cohen provided late cover at Channel 4's short-lived comedy series The Eleven o'clock Show, bringing his comic creation, Ali G, to the nation's TV screens for the first time. The character became an overnight hit, Cohen landed his own show and starred in a movie. He subsequently found fame in America. Holiday cover can boost the careers of highbrow presenters. Former BBC political editor Andrew Marr did a stint on Start the Week, deputising for Melvyn Bragg, and stayed for far longer, quickly becoming synonymous with the Radio 4 show. Today presenter Caroline Quinn was handed more airtime this summer while Jim Naughtie and John Humphrys took time off. Stepping in for colleagues in other circumstances can also bring presenters suddenly, if briefly, into the public eye. When BBC staff went on strike in May, with the support of most of its big-name newsreaders, a little-known presenter called Stephen Cole was drafted in to present the news. He was one of the few BBC staffers to cross the picket lines, and his appearance on the flagship Ten o'clock News won him an audience of female fans. Cole presents BBC World's half-hour technology show, Click Online, which is repeated around the clock throughout the week. But despite his successful stint, Cole has not returned to prime time. This Morning host Fern Britton was a jobbing local TV presenter for over 20 years before she was asked to front BBC2's Ready Steady Cook. But her big break came when she deputised for Judy Finnigan on ITV's This Morning each Friday. When Finnigan and husband Richard Madeley defected to Channel 4, Britton became the face of ITV's morning schedule, along with co-presenter Philip Schofield. Last week, when Britton and Schofield took their summer break, This Morning was presented by former Blue Peter presenter Richard Bacon and Denise Van Outen. Bacon may be hoping he can move seamlessly from 'yoof TV' into mainstream presenting; it may not do much for your 'street cred', but it does wonders for your bank balance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
