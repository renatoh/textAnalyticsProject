But, as with income-tax demands and the annual re-appearance of Wizzard's I Wish It Could be Christmas Every Day, shift-work is inescapable: everyone in broadcasting has to get used to it somehow. Traditionally, fledgling presenters have the most practice, since the graveyard shift is often where they serve their apprenticeships, having their body clocks systematically destroyed beyond all repair. Only then are they permitted to join the ranks of the grizzled old hands, whose length of service can be determined by the layers of bags under their eyes, like the rings in a felled oak. I have to admit that my current 4.45am alarm call is almost sluggardly given that, in a former life as a TV continuity announcer, I worked a seven-week rota that involved a series of 12-hour shifts ending at 2am, followed by a switch to 4.30am starts. But there are some advantages to peculiar hours. Well, maybe two. It's easy to find a seat on the train home when you don't travel in the communal rush. And a wondrous new world of walk-in baths, stairlifts and ear-wax preparations will open up before your astonished eyes should you happen to flick on the TV of an afternoon (but beware - this is almost certain to put you on the slippery slope to Countdown). The downside to working shifts is that Richard and Judy's, You Say, We Pay slot will become the most exciting event in your life, because a 9.30pm bedtime will put paid to all social activities. Any sleep you do get during the depressingly short night will be interrupted at least 15 times as you wake in a cold sweat to reassure yourself that you haven't missed the alarm. You'll lose track of bank holidays because you always work them anyway. In fact, it's all too easy to get as confused as a colleague of mine who retired extra-early, determined to have a sound night's sleep before his breakfast newsreading shift. He woke suddenly to the awful conviction that he was late; leapt out of bed and into the shower, and was racing for the door when he noticed, through his kitchen window, a lot of people strolling about outside - more people than you'd expect at 5.30am. Only then did he look at his watch: he'd been asleep for two hours and the gentle dawn of a summer's day was actually the gentle twilight of a summer's evening. Still, at least he could look forward to another six hours in bed. \u00b7 Penny Gore presents Morning On 3 on BBC Radio 3"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
