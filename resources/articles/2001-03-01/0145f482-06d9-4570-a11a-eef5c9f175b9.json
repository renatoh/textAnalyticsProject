US shares fell sharply after technology companies such Nortel Networks, the largest manufacturer of fibre-optic equipment, and Palm, the leading manufacturer of electronic organisers, warned of disappointing earnings. Walt Disney, the world's second biggest media and entertainment group, also blamed a difficult market environment for its unusual decision to cut 3% of its worldwide workforce. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 200 points, or 2%, to just over 9,700 at midday after rallying 6% over the past three days. The broader S&amp;P index also fell sharply while the technology-driven Nasdaq Composite Index declined more than 4% to less than 1,900. The severity of the declines after a three-day rally prompted analysts to warn of continuing volatility after the classic dead-cat bounce of the past few days. Even after this week's rally, the Nasdaq is down 23% since January and more than 60% from a year ago. The Dow, after recovering from a near 20% loss, was down almost 10% yesterday. Dick McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, said he expected the volatility to continue. \"The market becomes more emotional at times like these. There are a lot of people who have seen their profits wiped out.\" Yesterday's downturn came as a particular blow to Lucent Technologies, the telecommunications company, as it coincided with the company's much-delayed attempt to spin off its component and semiconductor manufacturing arm. Shares in Agere Systems, the Lucent spin-off, opened up fractionally but only after the company had slashed its offering price to $6 from an earlier range of between $16 and $19. The flotation raised $3.6bn, about half the sum Lucent had originally hoped for. The parent company has already earmarked the funding to repay a massive debt load. The company's prospects were hard hit by the decision of Nortel, Agere's second biggest customer, to issue its second profits warning in a month late on Tuesday. Shares in the Canadian company fell as much as 17% after it further cut revenue and profits estimates. Several analysts downgraded Nortel after it said that its 2001 projections were unreliable and that it would fire an additional 5,000 people by mid-year. The announcement brings the total number of jobs cut at the company to 15,000 jobs this year. Shares in Lucent also fell 13%, close to a four-year low, as a result of the warning and continuing fears over its ability to finance its heavy debt burden. Palm shares almost halved to $8.63 after the company said it expected a loss in the fourth quarter and announced plans to sack 250 workers, or about 15% of its staff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
