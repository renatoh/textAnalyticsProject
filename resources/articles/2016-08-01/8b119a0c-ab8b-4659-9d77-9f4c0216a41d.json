Yet once the dust settles on their thrilling 12-10 victory against Warrington \u2013 which may take some time given it was the lifting of a hoodoo which had plagued them for decades \u2013 attention will slowly turn towards following in the footsteps of Leeds, the Wembley winners last year, who went on to complete the treble. \u201cWe\u2019ll celebrate this for three or four days as it deserves,\u201d the Hull prop Scott Taylor said \u2013 but the reality is that both he and Hull will be thrown straight back into the cut and thrust of Super League in five days\u2019 time, when they take on St Helens, looking to cement their position at the top of the table and avoid undoing seven months of hard work in the league. Hull remain the favourites for top spot with four games remaining but any Wembley hangover may well play into the hands of the Saints, who are in the hunt for the League Leader\u2019s Shield as the season reaches an intriguing climax. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be tough backing up after that but we\u2019ll take our best there and hope to fire,\u201d said Jamie Shaul, the man who scored the final\u2019s winning try on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re still on for a treble, so touch wood we can do it. We haven\u2019t really mentioned it but we obviously know in the back of our minds what we can do this year now.\u201d Gareth Ellis agreed with Shaul \u2013 adding that the foundations are now there for a bright future for the Black and Whites, which can continue long after the 35\u2011year\u2011old retires. \u201cThis squad is capable of anything,\u201d the Hull captain said. \u201cRegardless of what happens this year we\u2019re in a position to build something. There\u2019s now an opportunity for the club to build, develop and create a legacy as Wigan and Leeds have done in the past: hopefully the club can put the things in place to do that.\u201d Shaul said: \u201cI\u2019d certainly like to think that this could be the start of something. We believe in ourselves and this really could be the first of a lot of good things happening to this club in the next few years.\u201d The large contingent of Hull-born players in Lee Radford\u2019s squad offers extra cause for optimism for what lies ahead for the club and, after the herculean 80-minute effort of Danny Houghton, including the crucial tackle to deny Ben Currie a certain Warrington try with seconds remaining, almost every Hull player who stopped to speak wanted to lavish praise on the hooker, another homegrown hero. Radford himself said the new England coach, Wayne Bennett, should be taking note of Houghton\u2019s performances; the Lance Todd trophy winner, Marc Sneyd, said the honour should have gone to Houghton instead of him but the man himself chose to deflect the attention away from his own heroics. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the boys and the group we\u2019ve got here because there\u2019s something very special happening. Everyone\u2019s going on about that tackle but it\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about winning the cup and winning at Wembley\u201d \u2013 something they had never done despite three previous victories, the last in 2005 at the Millennium Stadium. Taylor said: \u201cThere\u2019s no other player I\u2019ve ever played with who would have made that tackle. I think everyone will now talk about the tackle Danny Houghton made in the Challenge Cup final on Ben Currie. My heart was in my mouth. I thought we\u2019d lost it. He\u2019s an absolute legend.\u201d Irrespective of what happens over the next six weeks, and whether it is a treble, a double or nothing else for Hull FC this year, their class of 2016 secured their place in history by finally ending the club\u2019s Wembley hoodoo over the weekend. \u201cThere was a lot of talk about Hull\u2019s record at Wembley and we have finally done it,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe will be the group who will always be remembered as the first Hull team to win at Wembley \u2013 that\u2019s incredible.\u201d That will be a point well worth celebrating in both the immediate and long\u2011term future but there is no doubting that the club\u2019s most talented squad in years now have a marvellous opportunity to turn a historic year into an unprecedented one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
