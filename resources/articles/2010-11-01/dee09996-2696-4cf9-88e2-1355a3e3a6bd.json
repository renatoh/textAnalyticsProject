Tevez had been due to fly back today after being given special dispensation to spend four days with his family in Buenos Aries because of what the City manager, Roberto Mancini, has described as \"personal problems\". Instead, Tevez contacted Mancini to explain that the doctors treating him thought he should remain under their care rather than boarding a 10-hour flight to undergo rehabilitation work with City's medical staff. Mancini had told reporters last Friday that he was not concerned about the effect of two long flights on his leading scorer, but the Italian agreed to the request and Tevez is not expected back until Thursday at the earliest, with his participation in the game at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday in doubt and concerns also about whether he will play against Manchester United next Wednesday. Tevez has scored seven times already this season but the player's state of mind \u2013 the former United striker is described as homesick \u2013 has become an issue for Mancini during a difficult period for the former Internazionale manager. The 2-1 defeat at Wolverhampton Wanderers last Saturday was followed by more allegations of player unrest, though Mancini described as \"rubbish\" reports that he was facing a dressing-room revolt from some disgruntled players. Mancini criticised some of his players last week for their drinking habits and Gareth Barry has issued a public apology for his role in a night out in St Andrews last week. Together with Joe Hart, Shay Given and Adam Johnson, Barry ended up at a student's house party, with video footage subsequently sold to the Sun. \"I regret that, it was naive of me. It shouldn't have happened,\" Barry said. \"I have apologised to the manager; we were in the wrong.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
