And he was right. Mind you, the first place we went was down into the old Second Division.\" At Stamford Bridge, the man universally known as Ossie had been at the heart of the set that defined Chelsea as the swingingest football club around. So swinging, indeed, that the manager Dave Sexton tried to sober the place up by selling the likes of Osgood. He was all set to join his old partner in mischief Alan Hudson at Stoke when McMenemy persuaded him to head for the coast instead. \"Lawrie said, 'I'm going to build this club up. I want you to be part of it.' I was flattered, and even though relegation hit us hard, you could tell that things were progressing in the right way.\" Osgood didn't realise at the time that he was in at the start of a strategy that was to last throughout McMenemy's 12 years at the Dell: build a side around those who have tasted success elsewhere. \"It wasn't just me,\" Osgood recalls. \"He brought in an entire back four, all experienced lads. Then he got Jim McCalliog in, [Mike] Channon was already there. But for me the most important signing was Peter Rodrigues. Everyone said he was finished, Pedro, but he came down there and captained us for three years, brilliant. And that was always Lawrie's great strength - he sold the club to the big names. I guess the biggest was [Kevin] Keegan - he brought him back from Germany. Let's be fair, to bring the European footballer of the year in to Southampton, you got to have some gift of the gab.\" That, though, was all in the future. The start of it all, Osgood believes, was the 1976 Cup run, followed by Europe the following year, and then promotion to the top in 1978, where the club has stayed ever since. But the gallop to Wembley from the bottom half of the Second Division, he recalls, almost failed to leave the starting stalls. \"We played against Aston Villa in the third round and Hughie Fisher popped up to equalise in the 92nd minute and we beat them up there 2-1 in the replay. And that's when you start to think luck's on your side. But when we really started to think we had something was in the quarter-final.\" Southampton played at Bradford, and Osgood was involved in the only goal of the game, a piece of such inspired cheek it led to a change in the rules. \"We got a free-kick on the edge of their area and Jim McCalliog said to me: 'Flick it up and I'll volley it.' I thought: where's that idea come from? We'd never practised it, but I tried it, Jim's hit it and it's gone in the top corner. It is at that point you start to think, yeah, someone's looking down on us all right.\" These days Osgood watches all of the Saints home matches in his capacity as corporate host (\"lovely club, lovely people, lovely food, and the team's playing winning football: what more do you want?\"). And he draws parallels between the cup runs of '76 and this year. \"Like us in '76, the lads could have gone out in the fourth round. Kevin Davies has popped up in the last minute against Millwall and then they've gone there and won. Let's hope history is repeating itself. Little coincidences like that can mean a lot in the cup, believe me. I mean, we've got the same yellow shirts as '76 - that's got to be good, too.\" And perhaps the biggest parallel, he reckons, is that Southampton are once again up against red-hot favourites in the final. \"Yeah, I think Man United were 1-6, ridiculous odds. Tommy Doc [United manager] said something about our semi against Crystal Palace being a joke. They thought they just had to turn up to win. But the thing is, we were never intimidated by that. That's where Lawrie's policy paid dividends. There was a wealth of experience. We'd all been to Wembley before to play internationals. It was a pleasure for us to play there again, a bonus. And they were all young lads, United. When we looked into their eyes in the tunnel we could see they looked a little bit timid. We were all laughing and joking and waving to our wives. We knew we'd won it from that moment.\" It is, he says, such things that make the difference; at the Cup final superiority does not always count. \"Gordon [Strachan, the Southampton manager] gets a little bit more excited by things than Lawrie, but I'm sure he'll say to the lads what Lawrie said to us on the day: don't worry about who they are, just play your game. Of course, if they think about what an awesome side Arsenal can be, they'll think here's no point even turning up. So let's not even mention that, shall we?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
