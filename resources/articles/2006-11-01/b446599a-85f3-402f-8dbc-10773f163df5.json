Looking at his life, the evidence piles up. He chose his flat in Hampstead 'based on closest to the tube, closest to the supermarket'. There are the legendary (hilarious, circular, bonkers) conversations he enjoyed with Ricky Gervais and Karl Pilkington, captured on pod-casts of The Ricky Gervais Show, and now collected in the book, The World of Karl Pilkington. And when he's not working, he spends vast amounts of time lolling around his flat, watching DVDs, scouring the internet for trivia, and pursuing his obsessions of film, comedy and music. 'I could happily potter for hours on end,' he says. 'I kill days.' So, is Merchant the eternal student? 'I suppose I'm trying to avoid adulthood,' he says. 'I've been fighting adulthood the whole time. I don't like the responsibilities of adulthood, the idea of having to be grown up. I think I've got - what's it called, when I'm partially living like a 21-year-old?' Arrested development? 'Yes.' Merchant feels that this is partly because he worked so hard when he was a real student at Warwick university. 'They weren't wild, troubled years, and they probably should have been more so.' What does he feel he missed out on? 'The problem for a long time was that I wished I could live life more like a film. With a beginning, middle, and end. And adventure.' Merchant smiles. 'But you know, I like the fact that I can live like a student, but with nicer carpets. That's a lovely position to be in.' We meet at the London offices of Little, Brown (who are publishing the Extras scripts) and walk down to a cafe in a nearby park, which is an experience in itself. Merchant is famously tall (6ft 7in), and so thin he seems even taller, a bit like a telegraph pole with a head. Not wanting him to feel self-conscious, I'd put on my highest heels, but it doesn't make any difference - trotting alongside Merchant through the park, in my red mac, I still end up feeling like the killer-dwarf in Don't Look Now. People are staring over - maybe because of his height ('People have always looked at me,' he says stoically), but most probably because, although Merchant has long been well known in comedy and television circles, his public profile has rocketed since he started appearing in Extras In The Office, Merchant appeared only once, in the Comic Relief episode, as the 'Oggmonster', but in Extras he's been playing Ricky Gervais's merrily inept showbiz agent. And after a shaky start (he had to find his acting legs), his scenes, particularly with 'Barry from EastEnders', have been widely acknowledged as the highlights of the series. As we sit down with our cappuccinos, I ask if Merchant was frustrated before, with Gervais so much the public face of The Office? 'Not at all,' he says. 'Ricky was always very generous in interviews, always quick to say it was a collaborative thing.' For Merchant, who'd always enjoyed drama at school, appearing in Extras was just about having fun. 'Like dressing up when you're a kid, or playing cowboys and indians.' Are the rumours true that they're stopping Extras after two series, like they did with The Office? 'Well,' says Merchant. 'We haven't officially stopped it. We've only just finished, so we haven't even sat down to talk about it.' That sounds like a 'Yes'. If so, what a shame - with series two, Extras really seemed to hit its stride. I ask Merchant, were the show's darker themes (racism, homophobia, a terminally ill child-fan in the last episode) their way of pushing it as hard as they could? 'These subjects were amusing to us, not because they were taboos in comedy, but because they were uncomfortable in real life,' he says. 'We used to joke about the fact that whenever somebody's lost a relative, people always say, \"Is there anything I can do?\" And we love the idea of someone going: \"Well, there is actually. I would love \u00a35,000, and could you help me decorate my back bedroom? And actually I've always fancied you - do you want a shag?\"' Merchant beams. 'It's this idea that there's an accepted way of behaving in these areas, and, if you fail to act in that way, like with people of race or colour, then it becomes hilarious.' According to Merchant, it was always the intention for Extras to be 'sillier, more vaudeville' than The Office. 'It's just a series of double acts really, quite lazy - Ashley [Jensen] and Ricky, me and Ricky, me and \"Barry\",' he says. 'It never really occurred to us at first that we could get celebrities. And then we thought - wouldn't it be funny if there were just celebs in the background, who never said anything? We could fly them over at great expense and they'd never say any lines. And then we realised, that would be silly. If you've got Kate Winslet, then you should maybe give her some lines.' Stephen Merchant has always said that he likes the guest stars to feel as if they're 'having a fun day at Alton Towers', but, the fact is, Extras was always at its best when it was edgier, even slightly cruel. Though one couldn't help but notice that they were a lot crueller to people like Les Dennis and Keith Chegwin than to the big Hollywood stars such as Kate Winslet, Orlando Bloom or Robert De Niro. 'I don't think we were cruel,' says Merchant, alarmed. He explains the intention was always to play with the 'media construct' of their guests. 'But it's also like old Morecambe and Wise shows - get Andre Previn, and have a bit of a laugh, and then go home again.' Merchant smiles. 'It really wasn't supposed to be this great attack on celebrity.' Talking to me on the phone later, Shaun Williamson (aka 'Barry from EastEnders') agrees with Merchant that it wasn't cruel to actors: 'Nobody's going to suffer from being in Extras.' Williamson says that when he was first approached, 'They explained the situation, and that my ego could be in for a bruising'. Actually, since leaving EastEnders, Williamson had been working non-stop ('What I did on Extras was a sort of apocalyptic version of what might have been'), but since appearing on the show he's been offered films, The Secret Policeman's Ball - 'stuff I would never have been offered before'. 'I wouldn't change it for the world. It's the best thing I've ever done,' he says. 'I don't think anyone who comes into their orbit suffers for it - look at Martin Freeman, Lucy Davis, and Mackenzie Crook - they've all gone into the stratosphere.' And Merchant and Gervais? Williamson laughs: 'They remind me of two big kids having fun. They've struck the jackpot, and they're enjoying it.' Born in 1974, Merchant was brought up in Bristol by parents Ron and Elaine, in what appears to be a textbook happy childhood. 'Its embarrassing,' he says. 'I've always wished I had more neuroses. Some kind of religious upbringing I could rebel against, or that my father was a drunk.' Irony aside, there was always his height - it can't have been easy being a 6ft 7in teenager. 'I wasn't emotionally scarred, but I was quite self-conscious about it when I was younger,' says Merchant. On the other hand, he found it a spur: 'Because I was so tall, people's heads would be turning and looking at me and I'd think - well, if they're going to look at me, it may as well be because I've been on telly, and I'm a comedian.' Obsessed with comedy from a young age, one person Merchant admired was John Cleese, also tall, and from nearby Weston-Super-Mare. It was because of Cleese that Merchant wanted to go to Cambridge and join Footlights. However, in retrospect, he feels 'lucky' that Footlights didn't work out. 'I would probably have tried to be something I wasn't - arch, erudite, wordy, pretentious, in a way I'm not.' At Warwick, Merchant worked on student radio; afterwards, he returned to Bristol, where he tried a bit of stand-up, but felt frustrated because he couldn't find his 'voice'. 'It was like, \"Where's my angle, why am I doing this? If I can't be as good as Chris Rock, why would I bother?\"' During this time, there seems to have been rather a dearth of female companionship. (In fact, generally, there seems to be little mention of women or relationships in Merchant's press cuttings.) Looking on websites, I can see that Merchant is a major heart-throb with comedy fans, but does he do relationships? 'Yes, I have done relationships,' he says. It transpires that he's 'quite romantic'. So, 'Consequently it would have to be right to give it a lot of time.' Does he consider himself a bit of a catch? 'No, I don't consider myself a catch,' says Merchant sternly. 'I don't feel like I'm running away from relationships,' he says. 'It's just that I feel I need to meet the right person.' Fair enough. I just wondered if it dovetailed into that stuff about not wanting things to get too 'grown-up'. 'Maybe.' Merchant throws me a shrewd amused look. 'I would hope you put that in, certainly - what I like about these sorts of articles is that there's always a bit of cod psychology thrown in. I would hope I would get an insight into my personality.' (Having listened to this bit of the tape back several times, I'm still not sure if Merchant is egging me on or telling me off, though the only bit of 'cod psychology' I can muster is that he's really not keen on nosey questions about his personal life.) 'It's a private thing,' he says. 'I'm not worried or embarrassed, it's just not my place to talk about other people.' Anyway, in 1997, Merchant applied for a job as Ricky Gervais's assistant at the then-fledgling alternative radio station XFM. As legend has it, Gervais rang him and said, 'I don't know what I'm doing - if you promise to do all the work you've got the job.' These days, Merchant describes his friendship with Gervais as 'alchemy, luck, one of those amazing pieces of good fortune'. (Gervais says that he's physically unable to look at Merchant without cracking up.) Are they co-dependent in the nicest possible way? 'I do feel a kind of security with Ricky,' says Merchant. 'Because of his talent, and because he's so wise in many ways, he knows how things work.' Considering their 14-year age gap, you'd have thought that maybe Gervais was some sort of big brother figure for Merchant, but not according to Gervais. 'In the early days, Steve took on quite a parental role, particularly during the writing process,' Gervais tells me. 'He'd say things like, \"Rick, don't eat too much if you want to sleep\" and \"Can we start a bit earlier tomorrow?\" Believe it or not this brought out my creative side - being annoying until he laughed. When he laughs I've won.' Claire Sturgess, an XFM DJ who knew them both in those days, describes their relationship as 'Polar opposites, but it works.' During their time at XFM, she recalls racing up to their office every morning, and staying for hours. 'Just to be entertained by their ridiculous banter, just to see what was being spouted. They were a double act even then.' All of which makes you wonder why Merchant upped and left XFM for a BBC producers' course. It seems that his cautious career-minded side took over, and he felt he couldn't pass up the opportunity. 'I've always been cautious,' says Merchant. 'I wouldn't walk on a bridge for a dare. Even when I was young, I didn't do dangerous things like stage dive. I'd watch it and think, \"That looks fun\", but I'd also be thinking, \"If I jumped off a stage at a rock concert, I'd lose my glasses, and how would I get home?\"' Cautious or not, Merchant soon regretted his decision. 'I had to do proper work instead of dossing around with Ricky. I'd phone him up from BBC Pebble Mill doing some daytime Watchdog-type show and he'd be boating on Regent's Park. You'd think: \"What have I done?\"' However, it was while Merchant was on the course that the pair made a short of a Gervais idea, Sleazy Boss, which found its way to Jane Root, eventually becoming The Office, eventually becoming one of the greatest comedy success stories of all time, winning six Baftas, and two Golden Globes. When The Office finished, Gervais and Merchant promptly realised that they wouldn't be able to do anything like it again. 'It became a Frankenstein's monster,' says Merchant. 'When people start referring to Tony Blair as \"acting like David Brent\" in the Commons, and Ricky becomes a symbol for every news article about office life, you realise - you couldn't chase that, you couldn't manufacture it if you tried.' At the time, Merchant, still only in his late twenties, remembers feeling strangely lost: 'Ever since I was a kid I always wanted to write a sitcom that people would talk about in the same breath as Fawlty Towers. With the success we had with The Office, I felt I'd fulfilled my childhood ambition. It was like, now what? What do I do now?' The answer of course was Extras. Unsurprisingly, Merchant turns out to have reservations about celebrity culture per se. 'The theory is that they're giving the public what they want, but I don't think the public would be knocking down doors if they stopped printing it. They wouldn't be shouting, \"I want to see pictures of Liz Hurley shopping!\"' Didn't Merchant once say that fame was a 'devalued commodity'? 'I don't think it ever had any intrinsic value, but now too many of the wrong people get too much attention. I've said it before, you're not going to see Dr Jonathan Miller on the beach in Heat magazine, you're going to see Jade Goody, despite the fact that he's a much more interesting and profound man.' Merchant is a bit of a celebrity himself these days - doesn't he get to go to all the showbiz dos? 'I don't get asked,' he says, deadpan. 'Which angers and frustrates me.' Seconds later Merchant admits that he does get asked ('sometimes') but he's not interested. 'I love films, but I wouldn't want to go to film premieres.' He looks baffled. 'I mean, why would I want to walk up a red carpet with Liberty X, when I could just wait until the next day and go to see the film then?' Indeed, Merchant seems very aware of the perils of celebrity, and how to avoid them. 'It's not brain surgery,' he says. 'Just don't assume that because you've been on telly that makes you better than everybody else. Don't assume that because people see you on the street and shake your hand that you're some kind of genius.' Merchant considers for a moment: 'That's what's so easy, so dangerous, about this business - you start to think that people really care about what you're doing, and they don't. They might enjoy the show, but no one's sitting at home obsessing \"What is Stephen Merchant's next project?\" and that's healthy.' Actually, what is Stephen Merchant's next project? When I speak to Merchant, there doesn't seem to be one as such, though on the internet there's a reference to him having a part (Lieutenant Hooper) in the new television version of Brideshead Revisited. Rather nicely, Merchant seems most excited at the moment about the success people such as Jensen, Williamson and Pilkington are enjoying. 'I love it,' he says. 'It's just so exciting to think we played some small part in it.' Apart from that, although there's bound to be something happening eventually with Gervais, Merchant is looking forward to 'a bit of a break'. Ultimately, he says he would love to make a film, 'but if you're going to make a film, make a great one, at least aim for a great one'. He'd also like to have another go at stand-up if he can find his 'voice'. 'I have to think, because I'm not Richard Pryor, because I didn't get raised in a brothel or beaten, what are the areas that are interesting to me?' muses Merchant. 'And I think those are the areas where people don't get to live out their dreams, the people in the wrong jobs, or in the wrong relationships.' The 'lives of quiet desperation'? 'Yes,' he says, enthusiastically. 'It's one of the most heartbreaking and fascinating of areas. I'm not a big fan of science fiction or fantasy, I don't see why they're more interesting than the stories that are probably in this cafe right now.' Merchant looks around the tables thoughtfully. 'I'm sure if you scratched the surface they'd all have fascinating stories.' A little later we say goodbye, and I leave the very tall, very interesting, perhaps a wee bit 'studenty' Stephen Merchant standing in the drizzle talking to the photographer. 'Bye,' he calls, with a grin. 'And don't forget to put in the cod psychology.' \u00b7 Extras - The Scripts: Series One and Two (Little, Brown. \u00a314.99) is published 23 November.
