Doctors and nurses said they were being forced to improvise as they worried about access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). A consultant anaesthetist working in south-east England reported buying 60 snorkels to adapt into respirator masks. \u201cVarious other places are doing the same,\u201d the doctor told the Guardian. \u201cOne trust has ordered 500 and teamed up with companies who are (3D) printing the adapters.\u201d Samantha Batt-Rawden, the president of Doctors Association UK, said: \u201cIt is unacceptable that ongoing shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE) have led to this desperate situation. We have heard from numerous frontline NHS doctors who have been forced to improvise as they simply don\u2019t have access to appropriate kit. \u201cMany doctors have told us they have also had to buy their own respirator masks from hardware stores, while others have reached out to schools and laboratories for protective glasses. Some have approached 3D printing companies to have batches of visors made. In the wake of the tragic death of three frontline NHS doctors, it is now vital the government act to protect the frontline.\u201d PPE used by doctors treating contagious patients includes visors, gowns, gloves and masks with varying levels of protection. The most sought-after is a FFP3 mask, with the highest safety levels, but they are in short supply globally. The anaesthetist said that while his department had not yet run out of equipment, they were devising improvised models in anticipation of a rise in patients. He said there was no official guidance for the use of snorkels but Italian doctors had shown it was possible. \u201cThe snorkel masks have been adapted for use as non-invasive ventilators by Italian anaesthetists. They published their design including 3D-printed adapters to connect oxygen tubing to the snorkel breathing tube,\u201d he said. \u201cThis adapted connection can alternatively be used to attach a heat moisture exchanging (HME) filter used worldwide to protect tubing and ventilators from patients\u2019 exhaled gases. These HMEs are in plentiful supply. You now have PPE combining a full-face visor with filtered air, cleanable, reusable and resource-efficient.\u201d At one practice in Devon, a patient has been using a 3D printer to make masks for doctors. \u201cWe have not been issued with sufficient kit, so a patient has been making it. That should not be the case,\u201d the practice manager said. \u201cHe just prints using a 3D printer. He has taken it up a scale and is now providing a number of hospitals. It is a full-face visor on a plastic headband and it goes around the head, protecting the whole front of the face,\u201d the manager said. Another doctor said something similar was happening at their trust as 3D printing partners worked to help adapt snorkels. \u201cI think our hospital has plenty of PPE. We have just been tinkering as a proof of concept in the scenario we run out,\u201d they said. Elsewhere, doctors have raised concerns about ill-fitting masks. One said: \u201cWe have only this week started being fit-tested for FFP3 masks. This is supposed to be a requirement. Usually only one type will actually fit. This means there\u2019s been around two to three weeks minimum that staff have been dealing with possible Covid-19 patients without fitting masks because we weren\u2019t fit-tested. \u201cToday I was informed by one of our healthcare staff that we have around 60-70 masks left. That\u2019s it. When I asked a senior what happened after that, they couldn\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t blame them. They\u2019re doing the best they can just like the rest of us. We are all risking our lives because our government covered up reports that said we were woefully underprepared for a pandemic years ago. We are using eye protection now that\u2019s been donated by schools and DIY shops. That\u2019s pathetic.\u201d The Guardian has previously reported that schools across England were being asked to donate science goggles to the NHS. Meanwhile, the public is being urged to stop panic-buying breathing aids during the outbreak. Intus Healthcare, which specialises in sleep disorders and sells continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines to help with breathing, said there had been a huge increase in people trying to buy its products. \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of people are buying them out of panic rather than medical necessity, due to the news about ventilator shortages. We are being overwhelmed by these additional orders and are finding it difficult to help those with genuine medical conditions,\u201d said Tim Barker, of Intus Healthcare. He added: \u201cIt is vital that people understand that CPAP machines, ventilators, are medical devices and cannot be supplied unless authorised by a medical professional. They should not be being purchased \u2018just in case\u2019 without any formal diagnosis of a relevant medical condition. The orders cannot be fulfilled and they delay other, valid orders.\u201d An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThe Department of Health and Social Care has secured millions more items of personal protective equipment for us, which the army is helping get to frontline staff across the NHS with every hospital and ambulance trust, family doctors and community pharmacy having received a delivery. \u201cThe personal protective equipment sent out to NHS staff is certified by HSE as safe and appropriate.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
