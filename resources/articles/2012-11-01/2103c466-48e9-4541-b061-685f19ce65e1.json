The overall death toll in Gaza since Wednesday rose to 109 killed, including 26 children and 11 women. \u2022 Four members of one family in the Jibaliya refugee camp were killed, including two toddlers, in an air strike on a home there. Two teenage brothers were killed in a separate attack on a home in Rafah. \u2022 Episodes of unrest multiplied in the West Bank, where two Palestinian men died after being shot by Israeli troops. One was shot Saturday in Nabi Saleh. The second was shot today outside Hebron. \u2022 An Israeli delegation and Hamas leaders met separately with Egyptian diplomats in Cairo in an effort to shape a cease-fire agreement. UN secretary general Ban ki-Moon arrived in Cairo to hold cease-fire talks, including a session tomorrow with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, who also spoke today with US President Barack Obama. Obama spoke with the Israeli premier today as well. An Arab League delegation plans to enter Gaza tomorrow. The Turkish prime minister called Israel a \"terrorist state.\" \u2022 The Israeli cabinet held a meeting tonight to discuss the course ahead. No reports were issued afterward. \u2022 An estimated 140 rockets were launched out of Gaza at Israel. The rockets struck near an empty school in Ashkelon and in a separate attack one woman was reported to be \"lightly wounded.\" \u2022 The IDF kept up its remarkable social media campaign. Syria \u2022 Rebels claimed to have taken control of an army outpost in the Damascus suburbs. The death toll in fighting today reached 113, according to the Local Coordination Committee, with the heaviest clashes around Damascus. \u2022 The European Union joined France, Italy, Turkey and others in recognizing the Syrian opposition as the legitimate representatives of the people. \u2022 Turkey requested NATO missiles along its border with Syria. Egypt \u2022 A major rally developed around Mohamed Mahmoud on the one-year anniversary of bloody clashes there last year. No casualties were reported. Military officers and police clashed with rocks and tear gas over the reported arrest by police of a member of the military. The Times of Israel reports that \"rockets fired at Beersheba and Ofakim around midnight [40 minutes ago] land in open areas, no injuries or damage are reported.\" The total rocket count for the day was 140. That's the headline of an article posted to the IDF blog, which seeks to rebut the idea that the relatively low casualty count in Israel means that the country really isn't in much danger. Here's how the article characterizes such thinking: \"'If Gaza was truly a threat,' goes the reasoning, 'there would be more Israeli casualties. Just like there are in Gaza.'\" In answer, the blog entry implies that the country would be much less safe if there were not strong safety measures in place. The piece lists safety measures including \"preventive strikes\" on \"terrorists and weapons manufacturing sites\" in Gaza, the Iron Dome defense system, and \"readiness on the Israeli home front,\" including classes on what to do in case of a rocket attack. Note if you click through: the blog now runs a \"browser check\" of some kind before it pops up as viewable. Prime Minister Netanyahu, meanwhile, has thanked the public on Twitter for \"taking part in the national information effort\": The Local Coordination Committees, the Syrian activist group, reports that the death toll in fighting today has risen to 113 killed, including 49 in Damascus and its suburbs. The LCC said 15 were killed in Aleppo, 13 in Lattakia and 12 in Idlib, including an entire family. Ari Shavit argues in Haaretz that the assault on Gaza has already gone on too long than is good for Israel: If the operation had ended four days ago, the message that would have been received in Gaza, Beirut, Damascus and Tehran would have been clear and sharp: Israel has excellent intelligence, decisive aerial capabilities, resolute leaders, brave citizens and surprising international support. It's not worth messing with Israel. You'd be better off letting it live its life without provoking the country or awakening it again from its slumber. But just as in 2006 and again in 2008, Israel did not stop in time. Israel did not quit while it was ahead. And so, over the past three days, the impressive achievements of Operation Pillar of Defense have faded away while the operation's negative consequences have become more clear-cut. Full piece here. Two teenage brothers have been killed and an unknown number wounded in an Israeli strike on a home near the Rafah border crossing, according to local reports. The names of the dead were given as Ahmad al-Nasasra, 17, and Mohammed al-Nasasra, 15. Mai Yaghi reports for AFP on the desperate search for safety by some families in Gaza: \"My children are terrified,\" says his mother Umm Jihad, 37. \"My son Mohammed refuses to eat. He follows me everywhere because he's so scared and asks me every 10 minutes when we're going to die. \"He says he won't go back to school because he's scared he'll be martyred or that he'll come back from school and find that I or his brothers have been killed,\" she says. Their home is on the ninth floor of an apartment building in the western sector of Gaza City. \"The strikes would shake the whole building, and eventually they blew out the windows and knocked down the door. That was when we decided to go Khan Yunis,\" says Umm Jihad, speaking to AFP on the phone. Khan Yunis has also been hit in the conflict, but less so than Gaza City and the family feels better protected. \"The fear and anxiety have followed me here though,\" she says. \"I don't know what to say to my children and how they will overcome this fear when the war is over.\" Read the whole piece here. The AFP reports there were no clashes in the area near Hebron where Hamdi al-Falah, 22, the second Palestinian in the West Bank to die since the Gaza assault began, was shot multiple times by Israeli troops. Our earlier report on Falah's death is here. Hugh Naylor files a feature for the National on a bit of bombed-out building in Gaza, known as the Ship, that refuses to fall over, despite repeated strikes over multiple conflicts: \"Some of us haven't replaced our windows since 2008 because we would have run out of money by now if we had to keep doing it,\" said Ramadan Attar, 47, who lives in an apartment building next to [the Ship]. \"Residents are terrified. But people always talk about it - it's attacked over and over and over. But it's still there. I can't explain it.\" There are conspiracy theories, but few have solid answers as to how the building has avoided destruction. In the battles with Israel that began last Wednesday, residents living near [the Ship] said dozens of air strikes had smashed in and around it. Militants have regularly used it to fire rockets at Israel. Click through for a photo. It looks like it might fall over. Reuters adds detail to its earlier flash report that Syrian rebels claimed to take over an army outpost outside Damascus: Syrian rebels said on Monday they had seized the headquarters of an army battalion near the southern gate of Damascus, the nearest military base to the capital reported to have fallen to opposition fighters. Two units of the Islamist rebel groups Ansar al-Islam and Jund Allah Brigades said in a statement that they had taken the base of the Air Defence Battalion near Hajar al-Aswad after four days of fighting. Video footage showed rebels walking through the site, past destroyed anti-aircraft guns, and one commander saying on a walkie-talkie: \"We have completely seized the compound.\" Independent verification of the report was not possible. A video from today's State Department briefing with spokeswoman Victoria Nuland captures the tortuousness of the US message on the current conflict: UPDATE: It appears AP has taken down the clip. We're looking for a copy to post. Aha \u2013here's one, hosted by a Texas Fox affiliate. An Israeli strike on a home in north Gaza, inside the Jibaliya refugee camp, has killed a couple and two of their children, according to local media reports. There are reports of many injured in the attack, which reportedly leveled a home belonging to the Hijazi family. Any ties to militant groups were not immediately known. Killed in the attack were parents Fuad and Amna Hijazi and children Suhaib, 2, and Mohammad, whose age has been given as 3 or 4. A resumption of strikes in Gaza CIty. An initial IDF probe determined the air force was \"not aware of all the civilians present during the time of the attack\" that killed eight members of the Dalou family, including four children (two family members are still missing; two neighbors were also killed). The Times of Israel reports: The IDF launched a probe late Sunday after reports emerged it had misfired while aiming for Yahiye Abiya and hit the home of the Dalu family instead, leaving Abiya with only injuries. Reports said the wounded included three women and five children, while pictures from the scene showed a home reduced to rubble. In Monday\u2019s statement, the IDF said it was doing its best to prevent civilian casualties in Gaza. The BBC reported that the IDF did intend to hit the home where the Dalou family was killed, thinking Abiye was there. My colleague Harriet Sherwood attended the funeral today for the Dalou family. The New York Times report, \"Israeli Airstrike Kills Three Generations of a Palestinian Family,\" is here. (via: @acarvin) The IDF reports that, on the day of the most intensive diplomatic activity in the course of the six-day assault, 67 rockets were fired from Gaza. Cairo-based Global Post correspondent Erin Cunningham is in Gaza. My colleague Ewen MacAskill has an update on President Obama's conversation with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi: Obama, after meeting with Asian leaders over dinner in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, called Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi. He then phoned Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said Obama and Morsi \u201cdiscussed ways to de-escalate the situation in Gaza, and President Obama underscored the necessity of Hamas ending rocket fire into Israel\u201d. He added: \u201cPresident Obama then called prime minister Netanyahu of Israel, and received an update on the situation in Gaza and Israel. In both calls, president Obama expressed regret for the loss of Israeli and Palestinian civilian lives, and agreed to stay in close touch with both leaders.\u201d AFP reports: European Union foreign ministers, in a new blow to President Bashar al-Assad's regime, on Monday said they viewed Syria's just-formed National Coalition to be the \"legitimate representatives\" of the Syrian people. A statement from the bloc's 27 ministers welcomed the November 11 formation of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces and said: \"The EU considers them legitimate representatives of the aspirations of the Syrian people.\" \"This agreement represents a major step towards the necessary unity of the Syrian opposition,\" the ministers added. [...] Italy... joined France on Monday and Britain is expected to clarify its position in a parliamentary debate on Tuesday. UPDATE: AFP reports there were no clashes in the area where Falah was shot. See full update here. Activists report that a second Palestinian protester has died from wounds sustained in clashes with Israeli troops. Abir Kopty, a blogger who has been collecting details of West Bank protest activity on Twitter, identifies the victim as Hamdi al-Falah, 22, who joined a rally near Hebron. Meanwhile the Times of Israel reports that shots were fired at an Israeli military base near Jenin, in the north. \"No one was injured in the incident, and soldiers were looking for cars that fled the scene.\" Earlier today the paper reported that bullets fired from Syria had hit an IDF post in the Golan Heights. \"The army believes the bullets were strays, and not aimed at the Israeli soldiers,\" Aaron Kalman wrote. Haaretz runs a headline quoting a top Egyptian official as saying \"We are very close to cease-fire deal.\" No elaboration as yet. Reuters reports that Syrian rebels claim to have seized an army headquarters outside Damascus. Three hours ago the Local Coordination Committees, the Syrian activist group, put the number of those killed today in violence in Syria at 75, mainly around Damascus and in Aleppo. President Obama spoke today with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi in an effort to hasten a cease-fire in Gaza, the White House announces. Obama also spoke with Israeli premier Binyamin Netanyahu. He called for a de-escalation of the crisis, reportedly emphasizing the need for Hamas to stop launching rockets. A meeting of top Israeli officials on the next step in Gaza was scheduled to have begun moments ago. In Tel Aviv, Middle East envoy Tony Blair tells Al-Jazeera he's appalled by the killing of civilians in both Gaza and Israel: He says peace is \"tough to achieve in these circumstances\" but that \"you have to keep trying\". \"The most important thing is to get a ceasefire. Then, once that happen, you can start to go through the issues\". He says that if Israel continues to have rockets fired on its citizens, it will retaliate - so, the main issues are to stop Palestinian rocket fire and to open up Gaza. Al-Jazeera's report is here. Protests activity continues near Tahrir Square on the one-year anniversary of the start of Mohamed Mahmoud clashes in Cairo. Many observers see anger directed at the Muslim Brotherhood, perceived as having been unsupportive of the protesters one year ago, but now benefiting from the revolution. Police are confronting protesters, after a clash earlier today with military police. Tarek Shalaby is a widely followed blogger from Cairo. The last four deaths in Gaza recorded by activists on the ground were from air strikes on the adjacent Al-Bureij and Nusairat refugee camps south of Gaza City. Any militant ties of those killed were not immediately known. Shahd Abusalama is maintaining a list of the dead. A meeting among top Israeli ministers about the next step in Gaza is scheduled to begin in a half-hour. UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon will meet with both Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in an effort to bring about a cease-fire in Gaza, Ban's spokesman told reporters in Cairo. \"The secretary general wishes to add his diplomatic weight to these efforts, which are considerable and extremely important,\" UN spokesman Martin Nesirky said. Ban was to meet Egypt's Foreign Minister Mohammed Kamel Amr on Monday night, and President Mohamed Morsi and Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi on Tuesday, Nesirky said. Ban would then go on to Jerusalem and the Palestinian talks but had no plan to go to Gaza, Nesirky added. He gave no dates for the talks. It was unclear whether Ban would have official contact with any leaders of Hamas. Guardian Jerusalem correspondent Harriet Sherwood reports on the funeral in Gaza for eight members of Dalou family, who died in a Sunday air strike on their home. The bodies of four children wrapped in Palestinian flags were carried above a huge crowd from the rubble of their home, destroyed in an Israeli air strike, to their graves on Monday amid mounting anger over the sharply rising toll of civilians in the six-day-old war in Gaza. Bulldozers, which were clearing concrete and twisted metal from the site of the Dalou family's home in the hope of finding two bodies still trapped beneath the ruins, stopped work to allow the funeral procession to pass. \"Do these children look like terrorists?\" asked grief-stricken relatives and neighbours of the dead. Eight members of the Dalou family, including four children aged between one and seven, were killed when a missile struck their three-storey home at around 2.30pm on Sunday. Two family members are still missing, and two neighbours were also killed. Read the full report here. In a move that can not be reassuring for journalists covering the conflict, the IDF continues its stream of tweets saying Hamas fighters are disguising themselves as members of the media, in this instance sending a screen grab from an unidentified Palestinian broadcast of a car marked \"TV.\" It is unclear who was using the car to what end. The text in red next to the picture of Ahmed al-Jabari refers to the death toll in Gaza earlier today. Reuters' Dan Williams looks at how a ground invasion of Gaza would be different from Operation Cast Lead four years ago: Big armored bulldozers with blades tall enough to plow through houses and carve a path for tanks and infantry were lined up on Israel's border with Gaza on Monday, ready to invade if given the order. [...] Invasion would push the casualty figures higher. House-to- house combat would mean more civilian deaths. The Islamist Hamas fighters of Gaza and their junior cohorts have newly-acquired weapons such as armor-busting anti-tank guided missiles to greet the Israeli invaders, conceivably killing many more than last time. Israeli Ynet reports on expanding protests in the West Bank, where the assault on Gaza threatens to spark a new wave of violence. \"Hundreds of Palestinian protesters on Monday clashed with security forces in several locations in the West Bank \u2013 at the Birzeit University, near the village of Furiq and around Camp Ofer,\" Ynet reports. \"The protesters hurled stones and Molotov cocktails at the security forces who responded with crowd-dispersal means.\" A YouTube video uploaded today, not independently verified, purported to show a protest last night in Bethlehem: \u2022 The death toll in Gaza surpassed 100 Monday, including 24 children, as Israeli air strikes continued. Recent lethal strikes targeted a refugee camp in northern Gaza. The number of wounded in the six-day campaign stands at more than 800. \u2022 Diplomatic activity picked up in Cairo, where top-level Israeli officials met with Egyptian peace negotiators, who also met with leaders from Hamas. Both Hamas and Israel articulated conditions for a cease fire. UN secretary general Ban ki-Moon arrived in Cairo to assist with talks. A peace delegation planned to visit Gaza Tuesday. The Obama administration has issued statements supportive of the Israeli campaign, with the president himself seeming to seek a hands-off approach. \u2022 A Palestinian shot by Israeli forces with live ammunition in a West Bank protest on Saturday died of his wounds. It was the first Palestinian death outside Gaza since the conflict began Wednesday. Demonstrations against the Gaza campaign continued in the West Bank, where dozens were arrested over the weekend. \u2022 The IDF defended its attack on a media building in Gaza Monday that killed one and wounded at least three others. Military spokespeople said Hamas militants were using the building as cover, and released a list of four fighters that were targeted in the attack. Others called the strike an attack on the press. The Shurooq building hosted the Hamas al-Quds TV station and many international media organizations. Updates from Egypt here and from Iran here. Our Washington bureau chief Ewen MacAskill reports that \"the Obama administration is sticking to what is basically a hands-off approach to Israeli-Palestinian confrontation\": Although Barack Obama was on a visit to Burma on Monday, he could have made time if needed to talk with leaders in Israel, Egypt, Turkey and Qatar but opted against. Instead, according to the White House national security spokesman Ben Rhodes, he left it to secretary of state Hillary Clinton and the national security adviser Tom Donilon who are both travelling with him, to make the calls. The White House approach appears to be that Obama could only play a limited role in the confrontation, having next to no influence over Hamas and poor relations with Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. It seems to be a case of basically sitting this one out and, by positioning Obama alongside Netanyahu this time round, hoping to restart talks towards a lasting peace agreement further down the line. For this reason too, the US has already said it will side with Israel next week in a forlorn attempt block to a UN General Assembly resolution recognising Palestine as an independent state. Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East negotiator and now vice-president of the Woodrow Wilson Centre, said : \u201cIf Obama is to have a chance of pushing a peace process down the road, he has to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Netanyahu.... we have to build up our street cred with the Israelis.\u201d UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon has arrived in Cairo for talks with President Mohamed Morsi, Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Amr and Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby. European Union foreign ministers, meanwhile, called for an \"immediate\" halt to hostilities, Al-Jazeera reports: \"An immediate cessation of hostilities is in everyone's interest, particularly at a time of instability in the region,\" the bloc's 27 ministers said in a statement on Monday. \"All attacks must end immediately as they cause unjustifiable suffering of innocent civilians.\" (Update: It is unclear whether Ban will meet with Hisham Kandial as previously reported.) We continue to update our pictures site. An interview between an Israeli Channel 2 correspondent and the deputy speaker of the Israeli Knesset explodes when the correspondent seems to advocate the targeting of civilian areas in Gaza thought to be Hamas bases. Max Fisher provides context in the Washington Post: Things get worse from there. The conversation, which might sound familiar to anyone who has tried to have a discussion about Israel-Palestine in either Israel or the United States., devolves into emotional accusations about moral equivalencies (how can you bring up one side\u2019s purported crimes when the other side is clearly responsible for so much worse?), historical grievances, and on the respective suffering of Gazans and Israelis in the long-running conflict. Media beat veteran Howard Kurtz flays Rupert Murdoch for the Australian magnate's tweet over the weekend imputing an \"anti-Israel\" bias to the \"Jewish owned press\". Here's Kurtz: But over the weekend, Murdoch sent out a tweet that went beyond outrageous to offensive, truly offensive. He played off the worst kind of historical libel against Jews. And while he later tweeted a semi-apology, it\u2019s not clear he understands the magnitude of his hurtful words. The subject was the violence flaring in the Middle East, with Israel mounting airstrikes in Gaza after a long series of rocket attacks by the Hamas government. The message: \u201cWhy is Jewish owned press so consistently anti-Israel in every crisis?\u201d That\u2019s right, he said Jewish-owned press, reviving the old canard about Jews controlling the media. Who, exactly, is he talking about? Read the full piece here. (via @acarvin) The death toll in Gaza has now reached 100. Sheera Frenkel works for the Times of London and NPR: Gazan Shahd Abusalama is maintaining a list of names of those killed on her blog, Palestine from My Eyes. The list includes names, ages and in some cases the circumstances of death. Haaretz quotes an Israeli official as saying the chances of a ground invasion of Gaza are \"50-50.\" Israel's top ministers are to meet tonight to decide what to do next. An unnamed top Israeli negotiator is in Cairo to speak with Egyptian officials, who are also talking with Hamas: The negotiations [in Cairo] have yet to yield a breakthrough, but neither side has declared them a failure, either. Netanyahu, Barak, and Lieberman will meet again Monday night to continue their deliberations, and to receive updates on the negotiations and on the fighting in the Gaza Strip. \"The situation is now 50-50, between ceasefire and expansion of the operations,\" said the official. \"If there is no choice, we'll go into Gaza. There is no other way.\" A Palestinian in the West Bank has died of wounds sustained in clashes with Israeli troops at a protest Saturday. The victim, Rushdi Tamimi, is the first to be reported killed in the West Bank in the current outbreak of fighting. The executive director of B'Tselem in Jerusalem says Tamimi was shot with live ammunition. Ma'an news agency reports that more than 50 were wounded in West Bank protests on Sunday. The BBC's Paul Danahar, who has been in Gaza for the duration of the present fighting, tweets details of the ongoing ceasefire negotiations in Cairo. Israeli officials name four conditions beginning with \"no hostile fire of any kind to come from Gaza\", Danahar reports: 1/ No hostile fire of any kind to come from Gaza into Israel including smalls arms fire at Israeli troops near the border 2/5 2/ Hamas fighters must be stopped from travelling to the Sinai to carry out attacks against Israel at the Sinai/Israel border 3/5 3/ Hamas mustnt be able to rearm. International &amp; regional actors needed for this (\"Egypt can play a key role in bringing about ceasefire.\") 4/ A ceasefire must not simple be a \"time-out\" for Hamas, it must be an extended period of quiet for Southern Israel. 5/5 The demands of Hamas on the opposite side are thought to include the end of the Israeli policy of assassination, the opening of border crossings and the end of military strikes. Security forces in Cairo have clashed at a rally to mark the one-year anniversary of fighting on Mohamed Mahmoud street that left more than 40 people dead over the course of a week. The incident last year came to be seen as one of the turning points of the Egyptian revolution. Journalists on the scene report that military police are fighting police officers with rocks and teargas. The former presidential candidate and statesman Mohamed ElBaradei tweets: \"Martyrs of Mohamed Mahmoud: We will never forget you.\" A CNN poll has found that nearly six in ten Americans think the Israeli assault on Gaza is justified, Politico reports. The wording of the question was unclear: Only a quarter of Americans think the Israeli response to rockets fired at the country\u2019s cities is unwarranted, the CNN/ORC poll found, while 57 percent believe Israel\u2019s response is proper, and 19 percent have no opinion. The last time Israel waged a major offensive against Hamas, in January 2009, 63 percent of Americans believed Israel\u2019s actions were justified. In the poll released Monday, 59 percent of Americans sympathized with Israelis, and only 13 percent with the Palestinian people. The IDF press department is devoting a lot of time to making sure it gets across its reasons for the Shurooq bombing. The tweets continue: Here's an alternative view: Ma'an's live blog says the Israeli army is saying the Islamic Jihad militant Ramez Harb, who was killed in the Shurooq media building today, was \"responsible for propaganda\". Haaretz's live blog says the three other Islamic Jihad militants targeted in the building were all injured. The IDF lists the four militants: IDF spokeswoman Avital Leibovich adds: IDF spokeswoman Avital Leibovich continues: The IDF's official Twitter account and that of military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich have put out tweets discussing the attack on the media building in Gaza City: Mark Regev, the Israeli prime minister's spokesman, is suggesting on al-Jazeera that Hamas is using journalists as human shields. Israel does not target journalists, he said. An al-Aqsa journalist lost a leg in yesterday's strike on the building. Regev seemed to draw a distinction between al-Aqsa journalists and those working for the international media. al-Aqsa is Hamas's official TV station. He also described the building as hosting part of Hamas's \"command and control\" network. Russia Today has published video purporting to show the moment of today's strike on the Shurooq building. The video, which was uploaded today, appears to be shot from the back side of the tower. It has not been independently confirmed that the attack depicted is today's strike. The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad has confirmed that one of its top leaders was killed in the strike today on the Shurooq media building, writes Tom McCarthy. Locals initially thought the dead man was the owner of a computer store on the third storey of the city centre building, Reuters reported. At least one person was wounded in the attack. Most members of the media evacuated the building after it was first hit yesterday. The Shurooq building housed both local Arab and international media agencies such as al-Arabiya, al-Quds TV, Sky News, France 24 and Russia TV. Israeli officials have not yet commented specifically on the strike, except to say that buildings associated with Gaza militants are a legitimate target. Reuters reports that among the Israeli government's concerns is that \"If they go to war against their arch-enemy Iran's nuclear programme, the Islamist Hamas-governed Gaza Strip could serve as a launch pad for the reprisals promised by Tehran\". That raises the prospect that part of the motivation of the last week's destruction of missile-launching sites has been to make sure those sites are unable to be used in the event of any conflict with Iran. Hamas's Khaled Meshaal says he is not against a truce, but he wants his demands met, including an end to Israeli attacks and the lifting of the siege, Reuters reports. The Daily Beast's Eli Lake reported on Saturday that Binyamin Netanyahu had given private assurances to Barack Obama that there would be no ground invasion of Gaza - \"but those plans would change, he said, if Hamas escalated its rocket war\". Israeli military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich tweets that 116 rockets were fired today from Gaza into Israel. Reuters has been speaking to a senior Israeli government official about Khaled Meshaal's comments suggesting Israel had been the ones calling for truce talks: Hamas's comments about a ceasefire, alleging that Israel is begging for one, are about as accurate as its claims to have shot down an F-15 or attacked the Knesset. The Hamas chief also said Israel had to take the first step towards a truce. \"Whoever started the war must end it.\" And he said he would not yield to any Israeli conditions in truce talks. ITV is reporting that an Islamic Jihad commander was killed in the Shurooq media building. Abdel-Rahman Hussein sends one more quote from Hamas's Khaled Meshaal in Cairo: All options are available. If Israel wants a ceasefire brokered through Egypt, then that is possible. Escalation is also possible, especially as there are differences in Israeli statements. We are prepared and ready for all options. Here is a gallery of pictures of the conflict today. My colleague Mona Mahmood has interviewed a resident of the West Bank, Sameeh Muhssein. He says that people began to demonstrate in solidarity with their fellow Palestinians in Gaza as soon as they heard about the death of Ahmed al-Jabari on Wednesday. He says reaction of people on the West Bank in support of Gaza was much firmer than it had been in 2008, when people were still affected by the \u201ctense relations\u201d between Hamas and West Bank rulers Fatah at that time. Demonstrations in the West Bank are attempting to reach Israeli settlements of the Ofer and Qalandiyia checkpoints, he says. \u201cSome of them even reached the edge of Beit Ilyia settlement where the Israeli military command are.\u201d The Israeli army ran to disperse these demonstrations, which led to the wounding of many protesters and the arrest of a few of them. The Palestinian police started to gather in the streets of the West Bank, warning people against protesting near the Israeli settlements or checkpoints. The Palestinian Authority is trying to stop the protesters ... under the pretext of not having more casualties. If the aggression continues in Gaza, I can promise you there will be a third intifada as the political solution looks really futile and people are very upset here as they learn every few minutes of more martyrs in Gaza. We can't put our feelings in a refrigerator and just keep watching; it is really heartbreaking watching the bodies of the children under the debris. People are unhappy with Abu Mazen [Mahmoud Abbas]'s two speeches related to the aggression against Gaza and are making jokes of them as they did not live up to the level of risk the people in Gaza are living in and the audacious crimes committed by the Israeli army. People in West Bank highly respect Ahmed al-Jabari, who is originally from al-Kahliel city, in the south of the West Bank and went to Gaza to join the al-Qassam brigade. He is a respected national figure and gained the love of the people after the deal exchanging prisoners. People resent the level of corruption we have here, and Jabari was well known as an honest man and never involved in any case of corruption. That is why they are upset about losing him. Israel has denied Meshaal's assertion that it was Netanyahu who requested the truce talks, Reuters reports. Abdel-Rahman Hussein has more on Khaled Meshaal. The Hamas leader says calls for a truce have come from Israel, which has requested the US, Egypt and other countries consider the prospect. \"No requests for a truce have come from Hamas,\" he says. The BBC's Jon Donnison says Meshaal said Hamas was not interested in escalating the situation. The BBC's Paul Danahar tweets this picture of the Shurooq media tower in Gaza City after the attack today. The fire brigade has now put out the fire and are searching for survivors, he says. Abdel-Rahman Hussein in Cairo sends these quotes from Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal's press conference: Morale on the ground is high, in our people in Gaza and our resistance fighters. Compare that with the morale of Netanyahu. They have been taken by surprise. Netanyahu had three goals and many messages but he didn't succeed. He succeeded in assassinating the hero Ahmed al-Jabari. He wanted deterrence, and he has failed. He wanted to destroy the infrastructure of the resistance, and he failed. Thirdly he wanted to tell Gazans he has the initiative, to strike when I want, but the youth have responded with 'No'. The messages he is trying to send are numerous, but ... the messages went to the wrong address. He wanted to be seen as a hawk to win his election but it won't work. He wanted to test the new, revolutionary Egypt and Egypt has responded in a way he didn't desire. He wanted to test the Arab spring countries but the response was strong. He also wants to market his new advanced weapons but the simple weapons of Gaza has exposed him. With what army and people will he wage war after this, he has no will and no patience, he has no legitimacy. He wanted to confuse Obama in his second term after backing the wrong horse in the US election. This is a terrified enemy which has miscalculated. We don't have the same military or deterrence capabilities but we have deterred them with our will. Our enemy is drowning in the blood of children. Adalah, the legal centre for Arab minority rights in Israel, has emailed to say that \"bombing the civilian media building constitutes a war crime\". The Shurooq building housed both local Arab and international media agencies such as al-Arabiya, al-Quds TV, Sky News, France 24 and Russia TV. It was also hit yesterday, prompting Adalah to write to Brigadier General Danny Efroni, chief military advocate general of the Israel Defence Forces: Under international customary law, civilian objects enjoy full protection from any attack. Attacks must be limited strictly to military objectives. Insofar as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action, and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage. According to these criteria \u201cAl-Shoroq Tower\u201d is a civilian building, and therefore it is prohibited to attack it. Most media organisations left the building after yesterday's strike. Above is the scene in Gaza City showing the bombed Shurooq media building. At his press conference in Cairo, Khaled Meshaal, the Hamas leader, says an Israeli ground offensive would not be a \"picnic\" for Israel. It would be a \"political disaster\" and Netanyahu would lose the Israeli election in January, Meshaal says. If they wanted to do it, they would have done it already, he says. At least one person has been killed in an attack on the Shurooq media building in Gaza City, al-Jazeera is reporting. Meshaal says the resistance fighters' morale is sky high. They are all united, he says. Our enemy, armed to the teeth with conventional and unconventional weapons, were surprised, he says. They were shaken while our heroes are standing steadfast and unshaken. Over on BBC News, Daniel Taub, Israel's ambassador to Britain, calls this a \"chilling performance\" and attacks Meshaal for lionising terrorists as \"martyrs\". Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal is speaking in Cairo at the moment. He says he is proud of the Palestinian people, and of the Egyptian people. He says it pains him to see a single Palestinian child die. He grieves for those who have lost their dear ones and their homes. The treacherous enemies have killed Ahmed al-Jabari, he recalls. He loved Jabari as he loves all the heroes of Palestine, he says. Jabari was not an ordinary person. The enemy has dealt us a great blow, he says. He has confidence about the current action despite the difficult conditions they are working in. Reuters has also been talking to an Egyptian official about the ongoing peace negotiations. This official said Egypt was receiving \"encouraging signals\" about a ceasefire and said both Israel and Hamas were seeking guarantees. What we are trying to agree on is to achieve a ceasefire and achieve some possible guarantees, and then later discuss more guarantees. The news agency notes that both Hamas and Israel have summarised their ceasefire terms on social media sites: Izzat Risheq, aide to Hamas politburo chief Khaled Meshaal, wrote on Facebook that Hamas would enter a truce only after Israel \"stops its aggression, ends its policy of targeted assassinations and lifts the blockade of Gaza\". Listing Israel's terms, vice-prime minister Moshe Yaalon wrote on Twitter: \"If there is quiet in the south and no rockets and missiles are fired at Israel's citizens, nor terrorist attacks engineered from the Gaza Strip, we will not attack.\" According to a Palestinian official, Middle East Quartet envoy Tony Blair was in Ramallah this morning to renew efforts to persuade the Palestinian leadership to delay its drive to get the United Nations general assembly to recognise a Palestinian state, Harriet Sherwood reports. The Palestinian official expressed surprise and anger that he was focusing on this issue, rather than the ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza. \"[He is] way more concerned about delaying our vote at the UN than stopping a ground invasion of Gaza,\" he said. The Palestinians would not be deterred from pressing ahead with a vote on statehood recognition on 29 November, he added. The Associated Press quotes \"a senior Egyptian official\" as saying that Egyptian mediators are hoping to have a clearer idea on the possibility of a ceasefire by the end of the day today. The official said he hoped that \"by the end of the day, we will receive a final signal of what can be achieved\". The Palestinian death toll has now risen to 94, reports the Associated Press, as Israel's most recent policy of targeting the homes of Hamas activists results in much higher numbers of civilian casualties. Fifty civilians have died so far, according to Gazan health officials, while over 700 have been injured. AP reports that Hamas fighters have fired 75 rockets into Israel today. Twenty of those were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome counter-missile system. No deaths were reported; many of the rockets landed in open areas. Three Israelis died on Thursday, and dozens have been wounded, according to AP. Egypt is the key player in any attempt to mediate a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, reports our Middle East editor Ian Black. He weighs up the prospects for a ceasefire: Egypt has powerful reasons of its own for helping to defuse an already bloody crisis that risks becoming a wider and even more dangerous conflict. In that respect Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood president, is following a similar path to his overthrown predecessor Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi is far closer to Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that rules Gaza. Morsi is unlikely to do anything to jeopardise his country\u2019s 32-year-old peace treaty with Israel. Talks in Cairo between Egyptian general Intelligence and Israeli security officials are focusing on finding a mechanism to end the current bout of fighting, while the Egyptians meet separately with Hamas. The trick, as with any negotiation, will be reaching an agreement that allows both parties to claim to their respective publics that they have achieved something tangible from the blood-letting. Hamas wants a guarantee from Israel that it would end \u201ctargeted assassinations\u201d of the kind that killed Ahmed al-Jabari last Wednesday. It would also need pledges about opening the crossing points into Egypt and Israel - in effect lifting the blockade of the coastal enclave. Israel is insisting at minimum on an end to the cross-border rocket fire which has more or less united public opinion behind Operation Pillar of Defence. Any deal would include other elements that are unlikely to be made public. Israel certainly wants the Egyptians to crack down on the network of tunnels that are Gaza\u2019s lifeline to the outside world. Food and other goods are one thing, but the missiles that allow Hamas or more militant groups to strike targets in Tel Aviv and elsewhere in Israel\u2019s urban heartland are another. Hanging over the whole discussion, writes Ian, is the much advertised threat that Israel will mount a ground offensive inside Gaza, something which the US and other western countries have warned against. Israeli public opinion has its doubts as well. Neither Egypt nor Israel want to see the collapse of Hamas rule in Gaza. The PLO in the West Bank, weakened by the perception that it is somehow complicit in Israel's policies, is in no position to take over. But even if a ceasefire is achieved, it will take a far broader and more sustained effort, with wide international support, to revive the moribund peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. It is the absence of any such peace efforts for the last four years that have led to this latest brutal episode in the long and bloody history of the conflict. Here is a summary of today\u2019s key points so far: Israel \u2022 The Egyptian prime minister, Hisham Kandil, has said a deal to stop the fighting in Gaza and Israel could be close. Negotiations are going on in Egypt at the moment. Kandil said: \u201cI think we are close, but the nature of this kind of negotiation [means] it is very difficult to predict.\u201d Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that Binyamin Netanyahu, his defence minister Ehud Barak, and his foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, have agreed \"to give international efforts to bring about a ceasefire more time\". An official close to Netanyahu said Israel would prefer a diplomatic solution to a ground invasion. Nevertheless, troops remain massed at the Gaza border. \u2022 Israeli air strikes on Gaza as well as Palestinian militant rocket attacks on Israel continued today, with Israel bombing dozens of suspected militant sites in the Gaza Strip, bringing the death toll in Gaza since Wednesday to 90; three Israelis were killed by a Palestinian rocket last Thursday. \u2022 Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, headed to Cairo to join the peace talks. He said: \"Any further escalation will inevitably increase the suffering of the affected civilian populations and must be avoided.\" The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, described Israel as a \"terrorist state\" carrying out \"terrorist acts\" in Gaza. China said it was \"extremely concerned\" about Israel's bombing of Gaza, which it characterised as \"over-use of force\". The Egyptian foreign minister, Mohamed Kamel Amr, is to head to Gaza tomorrow with other Arab ministers to \"express solidarity\" with the Palestinians. \u2022 The BBC reported that the Israeli military did intend to hit the house in Gaza City where 10 or 11 members of the Dalou family, including four children, were killed yesterday. A spokesperson said the IDF believed Yahio Rabiya, a senior Hamas militant, was hiding in the house, but Israel did not know if he was actually in the house when it was bombed. Syria \u2022 A group of extremist Islamist factions in Syria has rejected the country's new opposition coalition, saying in a video statement they have formed an \"Islamic state\" in the embattled city of Aleppo to underline that they want nothing to do with the western-backed bloc. \u2022 Government forces have fired rockets into southern Damascus in what activists say is the heaviest bombardment in 40 days of air strikes and artillery shelling against rebels. \u2022 Turkey is expected to request today that Nato missiles be placed on its border with Syria to defend against mortar rounds fired from its neighbour. My colleague Mona Mahmood has been talking to Samier Na'awoum, a Gaza resident. Na\u2019awoum told her: We live in great fear all the time. The situation is very difficult. Rockets are falling all the time in different places. Children are in panic all the time and can't sleep owing to the repeated explosions. I live with my brother who has three children. We are following the TV and radio at home but the news is so confusing. Once we heard that there will be a truce and the bombardment will be stopped, which gave us a big relief, but then after half an hour we listened to another report telling us that a land incursion will be conducted by the Israeli forces by tanks. When we hear that we freeze and do not know what to do with the children and our thoughts get very negative, thinking of death only. We won't leave our homes whatever happens and even if we think of leaving where shall we go? All the doors are blocked in our faces. The shelling is targeting civilians and residential areas. You can't move one step as the rocket might land at any moment and kill you ... There is no power at all, most of the shops are closed, few bakeries are open. It\u2019s so hard to get fuel. No sleep at all, as you have to calm down the children all the time. There are no shelters to hide in \u2013 all we do when we hear the rockets, we run to the basements, but most of the families who live in apartments or makeshift houses do not have basements \u2026 It is simply hell and we are waiting for death to happen at any moment. The government in Gaza can help us with nothing as they themselves are targeted too. Israel's Haaretz newspaper reports that prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, his defence minister Ehud Barak, and his foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, have agreed \"to give international efforts to bring about a ceasefire more time\". Ma'an, the Palestinian news agency, reports that the blast in Eilat, right on the south-eastern tip of Israel, this morning, was caused by militants in the Egyptian territory of Sinai \"who detonated an explosive device near Israeli workers installing [a] border fence\". This map shows where Eilat is in relation to Gaza. Here's a video of West Bank Palestinians protesting against and throwing rocks at Israeli soldiers. The Egyptian prime minister, Hisham Kandil, has said a deal to stop the fighting in Gaza and Israel could be close. Negotiations are going on in Egypt at the moment. Kandil said: Negotiations are going on as we speak and I hope we will reach something soon that will stop this violence and counter-violence. I think we are close, but the nature of this kind of negotiation [means] it is very difficult to predict. This video shows a huge explosion in Gaza City shortly after midnight. The BBC is reporting that the Israeli military did intend to hit the house in Gaza City where 10 or 11 members of the Dalou family, including four children, were killed yesterday. A spokesperson said the IDF believed Yahio Rabiya, a senior Hamas militant, was hiding in the house, but Israel did not know if he was actually in the house when it was bombed. The Israel Defence Forces tweet that since last Wednesday 570 rockets from Gaza hit Israel, and 307 more were intercepted by the Iron Dome defence system. According to Reuters, the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has described Israel as a \"terrorist state\" carrying out \"terrorist acts\" in Gaza. Erdo\u011fan said at a conference of the Eurasian Islamic Council in Istanbul: Those who associate Islam with terrorism close their eyes in the face of mass killing of Muslims, turn their heads from the massacre of children in Gaza. For this reason, I say that Israel is a terrorist state, and its acts are terrorist acts. The Haaretz live blog on the conflict reports that a rocket from Gaza has hit Ofakim, just west of Gaza. This map shows where that is. Avital Leibovich, the Israeli military spokeswoman, has tweeted this picture purporting to show that Palestinian militants fired two rockets at Tel Aviv from Gaza's football stadium. That Gazan militants are firing from densely populated civilian areas is a message the IDF are also trying to get across: The IDF also reports that a rocket has hit a house in Ashkelon today. Reuters has been speaking to a \"senior official close to\" Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. The official said Israel would prefer a diplomatic solution to the conflict to a ground invasion: We would prefer to see a diplomatic solution that would guarantee the peace for Israel's population in the south. If that is possible, then a ground operation would no longer be required. But if diplomacy fails, we may well have no alternative but to send in ground forces. I\u2019m mainly focusing on Israel today, but in Syria government forces have fired rockets into southern Damascus in what activists say is the heaviest bombardment in 40 days of air strikes and artillery shelling against rebels. Meanwhile Turkey is expected to request today that Nato missiles be placed on its border with Syria to defend against mortar rounds fired from its neighbour, Germany's defence minister, Thomas de Maiziere, said. Nato\u2019s secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, told reporters the alliance had not yet received a request but would consider it \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d. He said: \u201cTurkey can count on allied solidarity,\" and emphasised that the missiles would only be to counter mortar rounds, not to enforce a no-fly zone over Syria. We are not speaking about a no-fly zone. If we are to deploy Patriot missiles it would be a purely defensive measure to defend and protect Turkey. Harriet Sherwood has more on Iron Dome, which was introduced last year, here. There was dramatic live footage on al-Jazeera just now as the channel's reporter had to duck for cover beside a car as air raid sirens sounded. A missile was then apparently intercepted in the sky by Israel's Iron Dome defence system, while another rocket could be heard exploding soon afterwards. In the US, senators have been criticising Egypt's reaction to the conflict, with one senator suggesting American aid to Cairo could now be in question. Republican senator Lindsey Graham said: Egypt, watch what you do and how you do it. You're teetering with the Congress on having your aid cut off if you keep inciting violence between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Carl Levin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate armed services committee, said of Egypt's response: It's pretty weak so far, from what I can tell. I think that they're going to have to take some very serious steps diplomatically to make it clear to Hamas that they're going to lose support in the Arab world if they continue these rocket attacks on Israel. Tony Blair, Middle East envoy for the Quartet (the UN, US, EU and Russia), has been speaking about the conflict in Jerusalem. Blair said: I hope in the coming days we can achieve cessation on a basis that is sustainable, on a basis that stops the threat of missiles coming from Gaza targeted [sic] Israeli civilians, and also then relieves the people of Gaza, who have also suffered of course. So far today, according to Reuters, Israel has bombed \"dozens\" of suspected militant sites in Gaza, killing 12 Palestinian civilians and four militants. That brings the death toll in Gaza since the conflict began on Wednesday to 90, more than half of them non-combatants, according to local officials. This morning militants in Gaza fired 12 rockets at southern Israel in 10 minutes, causing no casualties. One rocket landed near a school in Ashkelon, just north of Gaza, but the school was closed at the time. The Italian foreign minister, Giulio Terzi, made some optimistic comments before a meeting in Brussels of EU foreign ministers: \"I believe there are the conditions to quickly reach a ceasefire in the next few hours,\" he said. Israel had \"no interest at all\" in invading Gaza, he said. Exactly the opposite is true. Obviously, this Israeli self-restraint should rely on a guarantee that the launches of rockets should end. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, is due in Cairo today to join in ceasefire talks. He will also visit Ramallah in the West Bank, as well as Jerusalem. My colleagues Ami Sedghi, John Burn-Murdoch and Simon Rogers have drawn up a map of all verified incidents in Israel and Gaza over the last six days. Reuters is reporting that the Egyptian foreign minister, Mohamed Kamel Amr, is to head to Gaza tomorrow with other Arab ministers to \"express solidarity\" with the Palestinians, according to a spokesman for the foreign ministry. China has said it is \"extremely concerned\" about Israel's bombing of Gaza, which it characterises as \"over-use of force\" \u2013 although that could conceivably also be a reference to Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians. Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, said: China is extremely concerned about Israel's continued large-scale military operations towards the Gaza Strip. We condemn the over-use of force causing deaths and injuries amongst innocent ordinary people. China supports Arab countries' position on the Palestine issue, and appreciates and supports the proactive efforts of Egypt and other countries and the Arab League to ameliorate the present situation. We strongly urge relevant parties, especially Israel, to maintain maximum restraint and cease fire as soon as possible, to avoid any actions which may exacerbate the situation or raise tensions. Reuters writes of China's position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: China ... has traditionally had a low profile in Middle East diplomacy, but has maintained close relations with the Palestinians for decades. In recent years, it has also cultivated good ties with Israel, especially in the field of defence. The IDF are reporting that a rocket from Gaza has hit a school in the Israeli city of Ashkelon, which is very close to Gaza, as this map shows: This interactive by my colleague Paddy Allen explains how Israel's Iron Dome missile-interceptor system works. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the continuing conflict in Gaza, and events across the Middle East. Here are today\u2019s headlines from Israel and Gaza: \u2022 The war in Gaza appears to be in a grim holding pattern, poised before the alternatives of a ceasefire or a ground offensive by Israeli tanks and troops, reports Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem. The Israeli Defence Forces reported it had struck 80 targets overnight, bringing the total number to 1,350 since the offensive began last Wednesday. For the second night, there was a lull in rocket fire out of Gaza, with only one missile launched, according to the IDF. It claimed the capabilities of Hamas and other militant groups have been significantly reduced by bombing. Rocket fire resumed on Monday morning. \u2022 Israel has also sent an envoy to the Egyptian capital, Harriet reports. Reports from Cairo said the unnamed envoy had been taken straight from the airport to secret talks with Egyptian officials. Shaath described the contacts between Israel and Egypt as \"serious attempts to reach a ceasefire\" but a senior Israeli official in Jerusalem told the Haaretz newspaper that Israel did not expect a breakthrough. \u2022 At least 11 members of one family, including five women and four children, were killed when Israel bombed a house in Gaza City on Sunday as the five-day-old conflict claimed more civilian lives with no sign of a let-up in the intense bombardment. \u2022 Fresh clashes erupted in the West Bank on Sunday as Palestinian youths threw rocks at Israeli soldiers, who responded with teargas. But anger in the West Bank has not only been directed at Israel, reports Rebecca Collard in Ramallah: many also blame the Palestinian Authority for failing to take action over the Gaza offensive and for co-operating with the Israeli security forces against protesters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
