We begin in Alabama, with an awkward proposition. Presenter Dan Snow, channelling a charming mix of Hugh Grant and Doctor Who, has been talking to archaeologist Sarah Parcak for all of two minutes when he pops the question: \"OK, this is the thing, Sarah. The bottom line is: are you going to come with me round the Roman empire?\" She is, of course. That will have been agreed in advance. They don't just send presenters door-to-door on the off-chance some historian will agree to tour the world with them. Although one day it'd be fun to watch a documentary where they did. Five minutes in: \"So, will you come with me to find the lost city of Atlantis?\" \"No, absolutely not. I've got a paper to write.\" \"Oh. That's cool.\" Next hour: presenter in a submarine, forlorn and wounded, sobbing along to C\u00e9line Dion's All By Myself. But Parcak's up for it. So now our Doctor Snow has his loyal companion, and we're off in the Tardis to Rome. Or we would be, except this time it's the companion who has all the technology, and poor Dan Snow who has to gawp and yell: \"It's smaller on the outside!\" Turns out our Dr Parcak is a pioneering space archaeologist, and the lost Roman empire we're about to discover is buried deep beneath the earth, visible only to her on high-resolution satellites. Discoveries await. But not yet. First, we need to get emotionally invested in our new companion. Cue a whole minute of Parcak jogging in a forest, as her voiceover establishes her steely grit and determination: \"I'll just run into a brick wall until it falls over.\" She doesn't just find ruined buildings; she ruins buildings. Now at last we're off to Rome, and from there west to the ancient shipyards of Portus, the city's gateway to the sea, in search of sunken treasures. Archaeologists here, we learn, have searched in vain for its legendary lighthouse. Will Parcak and her satellites be able to find it by the end of the programme? Again, yes, of course. That's why they're mentioning it now. But there's nearly a whole hour and a half of other discoveries to come first. We start small. In the forests of Romania, she finds a ditch. A ditch of considerable historical significance, sure. But a ditch. Never mind. Back to Portus, where she has found a canal running straight to Rome. And now we're off, racing round the Roman empire, solving mysteries at every turn. How did the Romans rule ancient Jordan peacefully? Boom. Sarah's found a farmhouse; they made it prosper. Next. Who protected their farmlands in north Africa? Bam. She has found a load of old forts. Was there an amphitheatre in Portus? That's not really a mystery. But yes. Yes, there was. Has Sarah found it then? Yes, obviously. Once or twice, the commitment to the drama of discovery gets in the way. When Snow goes diving in the Danube to visit the well-explored ruins of Trajan's Bridge, it's presented as if Parcak has found that too, so that by the time he strides into the Coliseum at Rome, you half expect him to announce: \"At last, she's found it! The Coliseum!\" Or just: \"Rome! She's found bloody Rome!\" But all is forgiven in the end, when she leads Snow to the site of the once-great lighthouse of Portus, and we watch as it emerges, rebuilt in computer animation, rumbling from the ground to pierce the sky, a symbol of Rome's majesty, and now a monument to the glory of discovery, of knowledge, and of Parcak. Eat your heart out, Amy Pond. Elsewhere, meanwhile, documentary was being done the old-fashioned way. Eschewing quests, heroes and adventure in favour of archive footage and interviews, The Trouble with Aid (BBC4, Sun) was a gripping tale of humanitarianism gone wrong. It began with famine turned to propaganda in Biafra, finished with aid workers walled up in compounds in Afghanistan, and stopped off along the way to share some difficult truths about the efforts to do good in Ethiopia, Cambodia, Kosovo and other places. At its best it made its often uncomfortable points with a lightness of touch and a strong sense of irony, using footage of war and famine alongside Blue Peter appeals and Bob Geldof to question not just the value of aid, but our give-and-forget attitude to the suffering of others. A cautionary tale then, but also an inspiring one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
