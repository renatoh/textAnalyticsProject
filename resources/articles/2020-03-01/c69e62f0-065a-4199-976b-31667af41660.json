America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average has plunged into a Bear Market, after another day of wild drama and heavy losses. The Dow slumped by 5.8% today, taking it more than 20% below its record high of a month ago. The losses were driven by rising concerns about a global recession, as the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise worldwide. American politicians have, so far, failed to come up with a stimulus plan to calm and reassure investors, even though the virus has been declared a pandemic. Donald Trump is expected to speak about the situation later tonight, having met with bank bosses today- and promised to use \u201cthe full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus!\u201d In the UK, fresh losses took the FTSE 100 index down to a four-year low. It has now lost a fifth of its value in the last month. The Bank of England became the latest central bank to ease monetary policy, by dramatically slashing interest rates at 7am. Bank rate was cut to 0.25%, a joint-record low, from 0.75%. The BoE also tried to protect businesses and households from the coronavirus shock, with new schemes to encourage lenders to offer cheap loans to firms. The move was part of a co-ordinated UK response, with chancellor Rishi Sunak announcing billions of pounds of fresh stimulus measures in today\u2019s budget: New GDP figures showed the UK had flatlined in the last three months -- fuelling concerns over the strength of its economy. The president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde: warned that the coronavirus outbreak will spark an economic downturn in Europe similar to the 2008 financial crash unless EU governments provide financial support for their economies. The ECB is due to set monetary policy tomorrow -- will it take steps to support struggling Italy? Goodnight. GW There are pensive faces on Wall Street tonight, as the market turmoil shows no sign of ending: The S&amp;P 500 index narrowly avoided falling into a Bear Market tonight. It still had a rough day, sliding by 4.9% to a one-year low of 2,741 points -- that\u2019s 19% off its peak. Some analysts believe the index will suffer further losses, as CNBC reports: Goldman Sachs chief equity analyst David Kostin said Wednesday he expects the S&amp;P 500 to hit a low of 2,450, more than 10% below its current closing level of 2,741. Kostin based his new view on a reduced expectation for S&amp;P 500 earnings. \u201cI\u2019m thinking maybe something like 2,400,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. \u201cIf we end up with no earnings growth in 2020, we end up with a 15 multiple...that brings us to 2,460.\u201d Meanwhile in Europe...... Investors must feel like they\u2019ve been chewed by a bear, given the scale of the sell-off in the last few weeks. Here\u2019s some reaction to the Dow Jones\u2019s lurch into a bear market tonight: Michael Corbat, the boss of Citi, has claimed that we\u2019re not facing a financial crisis. Speaking at a meeting of bank bosses with Donald Trump at the White House, he insisted: \u201cThis is not a financial crisis. The banks and the financial system are in strong shape and we are here to help.\u201d Today\u2019s rout underlines how concerned Wall Street is about Covid-19, especially now it has been declared a pandemic. US investors want to see strong, clear steps from their leaders -- as we saw in the UK today, with the government announcing a stimulus programme and the Bank of England cutting interest rates. The worry, though, is that Republicans and Democrats won\u2019t agree what needs to happen. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, told MarketWatch. Are we now going into a back-and-forth between the White House and the Senate and the House of Representatives over potential measures? The market doesn\u2019t want to hear this tug of war, they want to know if Congress will be able to cushion the economy,\u201d She adds: \u201cThe hope is that we see a fiscal spending package targeted at the vulnerable areas in the economy\u201d Boeing had a shocking day, and was a key reason the Dow slumped into a bear market tonight. The aircraft maker\u2019s shares fell 18%, the worst performance on the index by some distance, after it announced it would fully tap a $13.8bn credit line, after suffering a jump in cancelled orders. Chemicals maker Dow Inc slumped 10%, as fears of a global downturn refuse to abate. Tech firms United Utilities (-9.9%) and Cisco (-7.5%) were also top fallers, along with American Express (-7.6%) and Procter &amp; Gamble (-7.5%) - who will suffer if more Americans self-quarantine or simply shun the shops. The Dow has fallen to its lowest point since January 2019. That means more than a year of gains has been wiped out in under a month. NEWSFLASH: The Dow Jones industrial average has officially fallen into a bear market, ending an 11-year rally. The Dow has ended the day down 5.9%, after another day of heavy, anxious selling. More than 1,464 points were ripped off the benchmark index, as it subsided to 23,553.22 points. That means it\u2019s over 20% below February\u2019s high, ending a run that began in 2009. The news that Donald Trump is giving a statement tonight could not drag shares higher, given the news that Covid-19 is now a pandemic. Newsflash: There are reports that president Trump will give a statement tonight on the coronavirus crisis, addressing the measures Americans should take: Breaking: US president Donald Trump has vowed to use all the powers at his disposal to tackle the coronavirus, in a flurry of tweets: America\u2019s tech-focused Nasdaq index is also on the verge of a bear market tonight: Earlier today, Swiss bank UBS warned that global stock markets could fall another 20%, if Covid-19 becomes a full-blown pandemic. They estimate that shares only have another 5% to fall in an \u2018intermediate\u2019 scenario, while they could rally if the virus is contained. Analyst Arend Kapteyn says: In our new baseline, we expect global growth in 2020 to fall to 2.3% (was 2.9%) and eight countries to enter recession. However, we also consider two further escalation steps: an intermediate scenario where infections increase by a factor 1000 and a full pandemic scenario. In the former, global growth falls to 1.6%YoY (16 out of 28countries in recession) and in the pandemic scenario to 0.8% (18/28 in recession). So for equities, that means -5% and -20% losses in intermediate and pandemic scenarios, respectively. If the virus can be contained, global equities should make new stimulus-powered highs by end-2020. North Asia and the US will likely lead gains, while Europe and the rest of EM lag. In the intermediate scenario, we still see a recovery in H2, but not enough to keep returns positive for the year. The pandemic scenario sees a major step lower in returns as growth slips with little additional stimulus at policymakers\u2019 disposal. More bad news for investors: the S&amp;P 500 index is also heading into a bear market tonight. Over in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s Bovespa Index has slumped by more than 10% today. This triggered a circuit breaker, forcing trading to suspended for 30 minutes. The energy, consumer cyclical and mining sectors are leading the sell-off: With an hour\u2019s trading to go, the Dow is sliding even further... down 6%, or 1504 points, at 23,513. That would certainly put the index into a bear market, if it closes there at 4pm New York time, or 8pm UK time. Democratic politicians are working on their own stimulus package, according to US political news site The Hill. The House will vote Thursday on sweeping legislation to address the economic fallout of the coronavirus, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Wednesday. Democrats are still ironing out the details of the stimulus package, including its size, but Hoyer put the price tag \u201cin the billions.\u201d Party leaders are expected to brief members of the caucus on the specifics on Wednesday at 4 p.m. \u201cIt\u2019s being written now, so we\u2019ll see how expansive it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a range of issues that are the economic consequences, as opposed to the direct health consequences\u201d of the epidemic. Anything passed by the House (America\u2019s lower chamber) would then go up to the Senate, which is controlled by the Republicans. However, there\u2019s a problem.... both chambers are scheduled to hold a recess next week. So any economic relief legislation might not even reached Donald Trump\u2019s desk until later in March. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin dampened hopes of a rapid, major stimulus package earlier today -- another reason shares are under pressure. Mnuchin told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that a major economic stimulus package wouldn\u2019t get through Congress quickly. So, it makes sense to start with a smaller measure designed to help small businesses and workers grappling with the coronavirus outbreak. Mnuchin told House Appropriations subcommittee hearing. \u201cThe president very much wants to consider a stimulus bill, whether it is through a payroll tax or otherwise. We realize that may not get done this week, so we want to get done what we can do this week and we will come back.\u201d Today\u2019s slump has more than wiped out Tuesday\u2019s gains, which followed Monday\u2019s crash (the worst since 2008) Today\u2019s rout on Wall Street is being driven by a handful of coronavirus fears. 1) WHO\u2019s decision to declare Covid-19 a pandemic is fuelling fears of a global recession 2) Doubts are building about whether the White House will deliver a stimulus package. Donald Trump\u2019s pledge of a major package, including payroll tax cuts, seems illusive. AFP explains: Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley -- a Republican like Trump -- said there is no bipartisan support for cutting the taxes automatically taken out of Americans\u2019 paychecks. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of analyzing the economic impact of the virus so right now I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s necessary,\u201d he told Bloomberg. Grassley\u2019s spokesman later said on Twitter that the comment was \u201cwidely misinterpreted\u201d and that a payroll tax cut remains an option. Newsflash: The US stock market is on track to close in bear market territory. The Dow is now 20% below its pre-crisis peak back in February; currently its down 5.5%, or 1,386 points, at 23,630. Goldman Sach\u2019s prediction that the bull market could end soon may be coming true before our eyes.... Meanwhile (writes Rebecca Smithers) the insurance giant LV has announced that it is to stop selling travel insurance policies to new customers with immediate effect as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. LV insisting that the move is a temporary one, saying: \u201cIn light of the impact that Coronavirus (COVID-19) is having globally, we\u2019ve made the difficult decision to pause the sale of travel insurance to new customers. We considered a number of different options, such as excluding cover or significantly increasing prices for new customers. We strongly believe this temporary measure of pausing the sale of new policies and focusing on our existing customers is the right decision.\u201d We are awaiting a statement from the consumer group Which? The S&amp;P 500 index is also being kicked around again, down over 4%. Investors are clearly anxious about the White House\u2019s resolve to tackle the coronavirus..... Stocks are continuing to lurch lower in New York, as the World Health Organization declares that Covid-19 is now a pandemic. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference that he was deeply concerned by the spread and severity of coronavirus, and by the \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d in some countries. Tedros warned that the number of cases reported and number of countries affected \u2018doesn\u2019t tell the full story\u2019. This has triggered fresh selling on Wall Street (not that investors needed much of an excuse to ditch stocks). The Dow is now down 5%, or 1,259 points, at 23,758 points. Boeing is down 13%, after reporting earlier that it received more commercial aircraft cancellations than new orders in February. Most UK stocks fell today, some heavily, despite the Bank of England\u2019s emergency rate cut, and the government\u2019s coronavirus stimulus programme. Just 18 members of the FTSE 100 rose, while 80 fell. Some of the usual suspects drove the rout, including airlines IAG and easyJet, and cruise operator Carnival. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s stock market has hit a new four-year low, as the coronavirus crisis rages. The FTSE 100 has closed down 83 points, or 1.4%, at 5876, after another torrid day. That, I calculate, means it has lost 20% of its value since the current slump began two and a half weeks ago. It\u2019s a really jaw-dropping slump, confirming the old adage that markets go up the stairs, but down the elevator (with a bump!) European markets also ended the day lower, with Germany\u2019s DAX losing 0.6%, and France\u2019s CAC losing 0.7%. Big losers included Adidas (-9%) and Puma (-5%), after both sportswear firms reported that coronavirus was hurting sales. Stockbroking firm AJ Bell has warned that it doesn\u2019t know how much damage the coronavirus outbreak will have on its business. It has also pointed out that today\u2019s UK interest rate cut will dent its revenues and profits (it will make less money from customer cash reserves). AJ Bell told shareholders: At present, given the extent of current market uncertainty, it is difficult to predict the exact impact of these events on trading performance. This will largely depend upon the length of time for which COVID-19 continues, stock markets remain at or below current levels, base rate remains at 0.25% and the other related measures remain in place. European stock markets are sinking into the red in late trading, as investors watch stocks slide on Wall Street. The FTSE 100 is now down another 75 points, or 1.25%, to 5885 points -- just below Monday\u2019s four-year low. Once again, the Footsie couldn\u2019t hold onto its early morning rally. Big fallers include budget airline easyJet (-7.8%) and conference group Informa (-5%), as fears of a global recession ripple through trading floors again. A Barclays banker in London has tested positive for coronavirus. The employee was based at the 5 North Colonnade offices in Canary Wharf, which houses Barclays\u2019 investment bank and is about a 5 minute walk from its headquarters. The worker has been in self-quarantine since 9 March after learning they had been exposed to the virus. Barclays is doing a deep-clean of their desk and surrounding areas, while colleagues and clients who were in close contact with the employee were told to self-isolate. However, the Guardian understands that the office has not been evacuated. Barclays issued a statement, saying: We can confirm that a member of our staff based in our London office, 5 North Colonnade, has tested as positive for COVID-19 today. The health and safety of our staff, customers and clients is our top priority and we are providing every support to the member of staff and their family. We are working closely with Public Health England (PHE) and other local authorities, and are following their advice. The colleague has been in self-quarantine since 9 March, following notification of their potential exposure to the virus. We are undertaking the recommended deep clean and disinfection of their workspace and the surrounding area where the colleague is based, in accordance with PHE guidelines, and are undertaking additional, ongoing deep-cleaning as a precautionary measure. We have also identified colleagues and clients who had close contact with our affected colleague, and are advising those colleagues to self-quarantine in line with PHE guidance. At this stage, we are operating business as usual; we continue to monitor the situation closely and will take further action as appropriate. It comes just days after a trader at Barclays\u2019 New York offices tested positive for the coronavirus in Manhattan. They have been in self-quarantine since 3 March. The Dow Jones industrial average is now down by 1,000 points. The Nasdaq has lost 3% and the S&amp;P 500 has lost 3.3%. A quick look at the S&amp;P 500\u2019s biggest fallers suggests that it\u2019s the US energy sector that is taking much of the pummelling, alongside consumer-facing companies. The US oil sector was one of the main targets of Russia, which thinks a price fall could knock out American shale companies (giving Russia more market share). And consumer spending for many companies will clearly take a hit if consumers are locked at home. Another notable mover: the mighty aircraft manufacturer Boeing is down by 9%, after saying it will draw down the full amount on a $13.8bn loan. It has already been under pressure because of the 737 Max crisis, so extra financial troubles could spell trouble. A bit more detail on Steve Mnuchin\u2019s comments today, in a briefing with reporters. The main thing he has mentioned so far is that hundreds of billions of dollars can be put into the US economy through deferred tax payments. The impact of the virus was initially underestimated across the the world, he said. The US Treasury is coordinating internationally. Does that mean that the US will match the response of countries like the UK with a fiscal expansion? Just in: US regulators are relaxing regulations that have forced some airlines to run almost empty flights. The Federal Aviation Administration, part of the US Department of Transport, has announced it will waive use-it-or-lose-it rules that mean airlines must run flights to avoid losing slots at busy airports. It said: Under normal circumstances, airlines can lose their slots at congested airports if they don\u2019t use them at least 80 % of the time. The FAA is waiving the 80%-use requirement through 31 May 2020 for US and foreign airlines that have affected flights. In doing so, the FAA expects that US carriers will be accommodated with reciprocal relief by foreign authorities at airports in their countries, and may determine not to grant a waiver to a foreign carrier whose home jurisdiction does not reciprocate. The main airports affected are New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy (JFK) and LaGuardia airports, as well as Washington\u2019s Ronald Reagan airport Chicago O\u2019Hare, Newark Liberty, Los Angeles International (LAX), and San Francisco International will also have rules relaxed. Here\u2019s some reaction to the economic aspects of the Rishi Sunak\u2019s budget. Sarah Carlson, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, the influential ratings agency, said: The fiscal stimulus announced by chancellor Rishi Sunak in today\u2019s budget should help to support economic growth given the economic headwinds created by Covid-19, but the resulting deterioration in the UK\u2019s fiscal position highlights the sovereign\u2019s ongoing difficulty in meaningfully reducing the UK\u2019s gross general government debt burden from its current high levels. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: The inevitable implication of higher public spending without net tax increases is higher public borrowing: the average annual budget deficit over the four years to 2023/24 is now projected by the OBR to be around 2.5% of GDP, as compared to around 1.5% of GDP previously. The implied increase in annual borrowing of around 1% of GDP, or over \u00a320bn a year, is significant. Public borrowing looks set to jump to about 3% of GDP this year, according to Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He said: Chancellor Sunak\u2019s \u201ctemporary, timely and targeted\u201d fiscal response to the Covid-19 outbreak won\u2019t prevent GDP from falling sharply over the next couple of months, but together with the BoE\u2019s response earlier today, it greatly improves the chances that the UK economy rebounds in the second half of this year. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has risen to 456, up from 373 a day ago, according to the Department of Health. You can follow the spread of the infection here on our main coronavirus live blog: US stock markets jumped last night with investors hoping for President Donald Trump to unleash a major fiscal response to the coronavirus outbreak. They now appear to be expressing their disappointment at the lack of action. Even with central banks the world over bringing out their monetary bazookas, the hit to the economy means that it\u2019s fiscal spending that is in focus. There are some snaps coming through on the wires from US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin: he says that Trump is focused on a broad strategy for a stimulus package. Sunak has just finished his budget \u2013 after one hour and three minutes. Sterling has ended up after the budget... almost exactly where it was before. It\u2019s a gain of 0.25% for the day to $1.2940. UK government bond yields have actually fallen \u2013 not the response that you would usually expect after a relatively big fiscal expansion. The 10-year gilt is at 0.26%, having hovered around 0.3% as Sunak started speaking. (Bond yields fall as prices rise when investors buy more debt.) There is still a lot more to come on the political response which you can follow here: The S&amp;P 500 is down by 2.6% at the opening bell to hit 2,808 points, while the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 2.7% to 24,337 points \u2013 a 671 point fall. The Nasdaq lost 2.4%. Lufthansa has just announced thousands of flight cancellations in response to the coronavirus, covering the period from 29 March to 24 April. For all passenger airlines in the Group, a total of 23,000 flights must be cancelled. Further cancellations are expected in the coming weeks. Flight schedule adjustments for the period after 25 April will be made at a later date. The German flag-carrier had already said it would cancel as many as half its flights. Sterling is now flat for the day against the dollar \u2013 possibly a reaction to a budget that looks pretty expansionary on the fiscal front. A pound now buys $1.292 against the US dollar, a gain of 0.07%. Sunak says he will limit entrepreneurs\u2019 relief, the heavily criticised tax break given to people who sell their businesses. The relief was \u201cexpensive [...] ineffective and [...] unfair\u201d, Sunak says. The lifetime limit on how much relief sellers can claim will fall from \u00a310m to \u00a31m. The \u00a36bn raised over the next five years from the change will be spent on tax reliefs on research and development, buying buildings, and increasing employment allowance. While Sunak has been speaking the market selloff has accelerated. The FTSE 100 is now down by 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures indicate Wall Street could fall by 3.3% in 25 mins when markets open. Dow Jones industrial average futures are down by 3.1%. CBI lead economist Alpesh Paleja notes that the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s forecasts need to be taken with a large dose of salt. The government will boost spending by \u00a3175bn over the next five years, increasing productivity, Sunak says. Growth will be 0.5 percentage points higher than it would have been without the spending, he says, citing the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s forecasts. Pre-coronavirus the OBR had forecast GDP growth of 1.1% in 2020, 1.8% in 2021, 1.5% in 2022, 1.3% in 2023, and 1.4% in 2024. The total fiscal response to the coronavirus outbreak is \u00a330bn, Sunak says. Sterling has pared some of its gains \u2013 it\u2019s now up by 0.1% for the day against the US dollar (having a few minutes earlier been up by 0.3%). Sunak announces a temporary business interruption loan scheme, which he says will unlock up to \u00a31bn of working capital loans. Retailers, leisure and hospitality businesses with a rateable value less than \u00a351,000 will have business rates abolished for the coming year. The policy will cost \u00a31bn, an average of \u00a325,000 per business. There will also be a \u00a33,000 cash grant to every small business. Sunak says that the coronavirus response has been \u201cclearly and closely coordinated with the Bank of England\u201d. He pledges to use fiscal action with a three-point plan: Whatever extra resources the NHS needs, it will get. If people fall ill statutory sick pay will be available for anyone asked to self-isolate \u2013 even if they haven\u2019t tested positive. He will also create a \u00a3500m hardship fund for local authorities. Businesses with fewer than 250 employees will be refunded the costs of providing statutory sick pay. Sterling is up by 0.2% for the day as Sunak says there will be supply-side and demand-side effects from coronavirus. But he adds that it will be temporary. Shares on the FTSE 100 have fallen back into the red, now down by 0.2% today. Shares around the world appear to be back on the retreat, with US futures suggesting that there could be another steep selloff when the market opens. Rishi Sunak is up now delivering his first budget. Renowned emerging markets investor Mark Mobius has noted that not all of the global selloff has been warranted. Speaking on Bloomberg television, he said that there are \u201cincredible opportunities and bargains\u201d in emerging markets and gold, the traditional safe-haven asset. The chaos on oil markets will hurt oil companies and exporters, but it could also cushion the blow for consumers. He said: This oil price decline is good for India, it\u2019s good for China, it\u2019s good for all these oil-importing countries. There are \u201cterrific bargains in Turkey\u201d, while Indonesia will also benefit from lower oil prices, he added. But there are still big risks out there (not least given potential disruption to financial markets). It is \u201ctime to buy like the way porcupines make love\u201d, Mobius said. His interviewer helpfully chimed in with the answer: \u201cCarefully\u201d. Hello, Jasper Jolly here. I\u2019ll be focusing on global markets as the coronavirus turmoil continues, so head to the budget live blog for a UK focus (although I\u2019m sure a bit of budget reaction will sneak in here as well). That Goldman Sachs note from a few minutes ago does not appear to have helped global markets: US stock market futures have extended their declines \u2013 in spite of the Bank of England\u2019s intervention today. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 are down by 2.8%, and Dow Jones industrial average futures are down by 2.6%. Right, I\u2019m off to give Andy Sparrow a hand covering the UK budget. It should include a raft of measures to protect the UK economy from the coronavirus threat, plus a big increase in infrastructure spending - and new growth and borrowing forecasts. Here\u2019s the Budget liveblog: Jasper Jolly has the controls.... The early rally in Europe\u2019s stock markets is fizzling out, again, as traders brace for another bumpy session on Wall Street. The FTSE 100 is now up just 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5970 -- close to a four-year low. Italy\u2019s FTME MIB has dipped into the red, while the Stoxx 6o0 is only up 0.5%. Stocks are expected to fall on New York - having rallied last night on hopes of a stimulus package. Investors are disappointed that president Trump hasn\u2019t delivered any details of the measures he mentioned yesterday to protect the economy, such as a payroll tax cut. Goldman Sach\u2019s warning that the bull market is on borrowed time isn\u2019t helping the mood either. The Dow is being called 800 points down, a loss of almost 3%, having jumped by 1,167 points (nearly 5%) yesterday. Goldman Sachs has predicted that Wall Street\u2019s 11-year old bull market will soon end. In a research note, the investment bank has predicted that S&amp;P 500 index will have fallen by 15% by the summer. Its new mid-year target for the S&amp;P 500 is 2450 points - compared to 2,882 points last night (and 3,386 back in February!). Italy\u2019s prime minister has tweeted that his cabinet have approved plans for a \u20ac25bn package of \u201cextraordinary\u201d measures. Giuseppe Conte also pledged that \u201cWe are doing everything that is necessary, with every tool available. Together we\u2019re going to make it\u201d. But is \u20ac25bn enough? Italy\u2019s death toll is rising alarmingly each day (from 461 to 631 yesterday), and its streets are deserted as citizens are locked down. A deep recession and a tragic social cost seems inevitable. Here\u2019s a video clip of the key points from Mark Carney\u2019s press conference: Over in Westminster, chancellor Rishi Sunak has told the cabinet that Britain has \u201cone of the best placed economies\u201d to survive the Covid-19 crisis. Sunak also confirmed that the Budget, due at 12.30pm, will include an economic action plan to combat the damage caused by the outbreak. A spokesman for Number 10 Downing Street said: The chancellor set out the measures being taken to manage the impact of coronavirus, laying out details of his economic action plan that will be announced at budget. He outlined how this plan \u2013 combined with the measures announced by the governor of the Bank of England this morning\u2013 will make the UK one of the best placed economies in the world to manage the potential impact of the virus. The chancellor added the budget will ensure businesses, the public and those in public services working on the front line against the virus get the support they need. He said despite the impacts of the outbreak being uncertain, we have the economic tools to overcome the disruption caused by the virus and move the country forwards. Our Politics Live blog (where we\u2019ll cover the Budget later) has the details: UK bank HSBC has announced a package of support for customers as they tackle the financial impact of Covid-19. For personal bank customers, it could let them defer mortgage payments, and/or switch to an interest-only mortgage. It is also waiving charges on its fixed-rate saving account, to let customers access cash if needed. HSBC is also offering to temporarily increase credit card and overdraft limits. For business customers, the Bank has \u201callocated \u00a35bn to help businesses that need support\u201d (from its existing SME lending scheme), and could also give repayments holidays or review loans. That could free up cash, to help companies whose sales take a big hit this year. The Italian government has hiked its coronavirus stimulus package to \u20ac25bn, as it tries to protect its economy from the most restrictive measures since World War Two. The AFP newswire has the story: Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Wednesday that Rome was allocating \u20ac25bn to fight the novel coronavirus outbreak that has killed 631 people in Italy. \u201cWe have allocated an emergency sum of 25 billion euros,\u201d Conte told reporters during a break in a meeting on the government\u2019s response to the rapidly escalating health crisis. The entire sum \u201cwill not all be used immediately,\u201d Conte added. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said Italy will immediately use \u201chalf of these resources\u201d and keep the other half in reserve. Italy unveiled a \u20ac7.5bn emergency response package last Thursday that officials later said would likely have to be increase to match the rapid rise in new infections and deaths. A top economy minister had said on Tuesday that the package could reach \u20ac10bn. Italy, whose faltering economy is the third largest in the eurozone, needs special EU permission to spend more than allowed under the bloc\u2019s strict budget rules for its 27 member states. EU leaders had said they would accept Italy\u2019s request when it still stood at \u20ac7.5bn. Here\u2019s a video clip of BoE governor Mark Carney pledging that the UK financial system is strong enough to help Britain cope with the coronavirus: And here\u2019s more reaction, first from Allianz\u2019s chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian: Here\u2019s Sky\u2019s Ed Conway: Plus Julianna Tatelbaum of CNBC: City economists are very concerned that the UK economy stagnated in the last quarter. Howard Archer of EY Item Club says this morning\u2019s data are \u201cvery disappointing\u201d -- showing Britain\u2019s economy was weak before the Covid-19 outbreak began. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says the UK economy is weak enough to justify an interest rate cut anyway! Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, has described the Bank of England\u2019s move as \u201cextraordinary, unprecedented economic shock therapy\u201d. Such as dramatic rate cut shows there are \u201cseismic coronavirus tremors running through the nation\u2019s finances\u201d, so the Bank is trying to encourage spending and keep money flowing through the system. Lewis adds: \u201cThe financial winners are those on variable and tracker rate mortgages. They will see cost cuts of \u2013 very roughly \u2013 \u00a325 per month per \u00a3100,000 of mortgage. And while it\u2019ll take a week or two to factor through, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see the rate of new mortgage fixes drop too \u2013 meaning it will then be a very cheap time to remortgage. \u201cMost loans, credit cards and other debts will likely be unaffected or only minimally affected because the Bank\u2019s interest rate only plays a small part in their rates. \u201cThe losers are savers. Many who\u2019ve worked hard to build up a nest egg will be holding their head in their hands at this news. Savings rates have already been plummeting this year, and this will massively increase the height of the roller coaster fall. Back at the Bank of England, Mark Carney is insisting that the coronavirus crisis needn\u2019t create a new financial crisis. Q: Do we need co-ordinated action by the world\u2019s governments, asks my colleague Richard Partington? Carney replies that he was involved in the joint interest rate cuts of 2008 (when he was Bank of Canada governor). Those measures were needed to \u201cget to the weekend\u201d, so G7 leaders could decide what steps to take, Carney says. Q: Won\u2019t savers suffer from today\u2019s rate cut, asks the Daily Mail... Carney replies that Daily Mail readers will understand that people\u2019s lives, jobs, businesses need to be protected during the coronavirus crisis. Q: But what if the economic shock of coronavirus isn\u2019t temporary, as you believe? Carney insists there is no reason for the economic damage to be as bad as 2008. His successor, Andrew Bailey, also warns commercial banks that the BoE expects this morning\u2019s measures to be passed on. Customers deserve to be treated fairly, he says, and we\u2019re watching....n Today\u2019s GDP report shows clearly that Britain\u2019s manufacturers have been struggling for months: Britain\u2019s economy was dragged back by a decline in its car sector in the last quarter. The ONS says: The services sector showed no growth in the three months to January 2020. The main drivers behind the weakening seen in services were the wholesale, retail and motor trade sector and the information and communication sector, which fell by 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively. This fall was largely offset by increases in administrative and support services activities, and education, growing by 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s economy failed to grow in the last few months, showing it was weak even before the coronavirus struck. GDP was flat in January, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics. It was also flat in the November-January quarter - weaker than expected, and dashing hopes that the economy enjoyed a bounce after December\u2019s general election. The ONS says that Britain\u2019s dominant services sector was flat in the three months to January 2020, while production contracted by 1.0%. Construction (a small part of the economy) grew by 1.4%. Q: Do you agree with Christine Lagarde\u2019s warning that Europe faces a repeat of the 2008 crisis? Mark Carney replies that this is a different crisis -- reiterating that the banking sector is much stronger than a decade ago. There is no reason for this shock to turn into the experience of 2008, which created a \u201cvirtual lost decade\u201d in some countries -- if policymakers handle it well, he says. Carney also points out that coronavirus is fundamentally a health crisis, pointing to the \u201cextraordinary efforts\u201d of NHS health professionals, carers, and volunteers across the country. The next governor, Andrew Bailey, wades in too -- saying the Bank has spent a decade bolstering the financial sector to cope with such an economic shock (although they weren\u2019t expecting this particular one). Q: If interest rates can be lower -- why didn\u2019t you cut them there today, rather than only cutting to 0.25%? Mark Carney repeats that today\u2019s measures are a \u201cbig package\u201d -- again citing the cut to the Countercyclical Capital Buffer which releases \u00a3190 billion of bank lending to businesses. And he again hints at the Budget will include significant measures -- you\u2019ll have to wait until the end of the day, or at least midday, for the full package. Q: Could the UK fall into a recession this year, and what happens if the coronavirus is not temporary? Mark Carney insists that the shock of Covid-19 will pass with time, as medical treatments are devised. It\u2019s too early to talk about a recession, he insists -- although the direction of the impact on the UK economy is clear. Q: Might the Bank act again at its scheduled meeting later this month, and could you expand your QE (bond-buying) programme? Mark Carney replies that quantitative easing is very much part of the Bank\u2019s toolkit. Asset purchases could provide useful firepower if needed. But today\u2019s moves are a \u2018big package\u2019, he insists. Reducing Britain\u2019s \u2018counter-cyclical buffer\u2019 (meaning banks are allowed to hold less capital) will release a \u201chuge amount\u201d of extra lending. Onto questions Q: Are UK interest rates now as low as they can go? No, Mark Carney replies. There is room for interest rates to be cut further, to just above zero. Q: What evidence is there that Covid-19 is creating an economic shock in the UK? Carney says there are some early signs -- China\u2019s growth swinging from 5.5% growth to a likely contraction. He also cites very early signs in the global PMI reports (surveys of purchasing managers). In the financial crisis more than a decade ago, the financial sector was the \u201ccore of the problem\u201d, says Mark Carney. Now it can be now it can be part of the solution Carney says the banks have been transformed in the last decade -- to make them strong enough to survive an economic shock. This was prudence with a purpose, resilience with a reason. Andrew Bailey, who will succeed Mark Carney as governor next week, is also attending today\u2019s press conference. Bailey says the Bank is taking steps to ensure that businesses and households can access the credit they need to get through the economic disruption of Covid-19. The new Term Lending Scheme should create more than \u00a3100bn of new credit, Bailey says. And reducing the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0% will support up to \u00a3190bn of bank lending to businesses, he adds. Outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney says today\u2019s actions are designed to keep firms in business, and people in jobs. Activity is likely to weaken materially in the coming months, with an economic shock hurting demand and supply within the UK economy, Carney tells reporters. The interest rate cut, and the new support for bank lending, will prevent the temporary disruption caused by Covid 19 from causing longer-lasting economic harm, Carney pledges. He also says the Bank is acting in a co-ordinated fashion with the Treasury -- and that today\u2019s budget will contain a series of government initiatives to support the economy too. Reminder: there are more details in the Bank\u2019s statement this morning (online here). The Bank of England is about to hold a press conference to discuss today\u2019s shock rate cut. You can watch it live here: Newsflash: the head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has warned that Europe risks a major economic shock similar to the financial crisis unless leaders act urgently on the coronavirus. That\u2019s via Bloomberg. The ECB holds its next policy meeting tomorrow, and many investors and traders believe it will announce new policy measures to help the eurozone economy. With interest rates already at zero, the ECB\u2019s options are limited. But it will be desperate to shore up confidence in eurozone banks - especially with Italy facing a deep recession and a possible surge in bad loans. Here\u2019s some instant reaction, from Peter Garnry of Saxo Bank.... ...and Carsten Brzeski of ING: Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s rapid analysis on today\u2019s rate cut: Heathrow airport has reported a significant fall in passenger traffic in February and March -- confirming that the coronavirus is wrecking havoc on the aviation industry. Britain\u2019s largest airport said that total passenger numbers fell 4.8% last month, due to lower demand on Asian and European routes, regions where airlines have significantly cut back or halted flights due to the spread of the coronavirus. The traffic figures show that Asia Pacific passenger numbers fell by 19.6% in February, with European Union traffic down 1.6%. The amount of cargo passing through Heathrow in February fell by 9.5%, to 115,800 tonnes, as the effect of the virus hits global trade. John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow\u2019s chief executive, says: \u201cThe threat of coronavirus is an increasing challenge for the UK and we are working day and night to ensure Britain\u2019s front door is open and safe for our people and passengers. We will continue to work with the Government to limit the impacts this will have on UK plc.\u201d City economists are expecting the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to announce a major increase in borrowing today. The Bank and the Treasury appear to be working in tandem to deliver a coordinated monetary and fiscal stimulus, in the face of a possible global recession triggered by the coronavirus outbreak. Sunak is expected to pledge to increase infrastructure spending in the five years of this Parliament by around \u00a3100bn. This increased spending on roads, rail, broadband etc will push public sector net investment up to 3% of GDP, from 2.2% per cent. Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, explains: That the BoE chose to announce its stimulus on the same day as the budget is telling. Policymakers are clearly concerned about the risks ahead. The joint action reflects the intention to send a big message that policymakers are prepared to take aggressive and pre-emptive steps to support the economy. At 12:30 today Chancellor Rishi Sunak will announce his budget plans for the next five years. We expect a significant debt-financed near-term stimulus along with an extra \u00a3100bn in public investment over the next five years. Today\u2019s shock rate cut is the first unscheduled Bank of England move since the financial crisis, and the biggest as well: Stocks are rallying in London at the start of trading, following the Bank\u2019s emergency rate cut. The FTSE 100 has rallied by almost 2%, gaining 116 points to 6074. UK housebuilders are leading the rally, along with holiday firm TUI, and banks including Barclays. But a word of caution: the FTSE 100 surged by over 200 points early on Tuesday, before subsiding amid coronavirus fears. On Monday it plunged over 500 points. The British Chambers of Commerce has cheered the BoE\u2019s move -- but cautioned that commercial banks need to pass these measures onto small firms. BCC Director General Dr Adam Marshall says: \u201cBusinesses will welcome the decisive action taken by the Bank of England to support the economy at this delicate moment. \u201cThe Bank and UK financial institutions must now work together to ensure that these policy measures translate into real-world support for firms on the ground. \u201cWe will want to see banks using new flexibilities to do everything they can to help businesses whose cash flow and prospects have been disrupted due to the impacts of Coronavirus.\u201d The pound initially plunged when the Bank\u2019s rate cut was announced -- but has now clawed its way back to $1.29 Reaction to this morning\u2019s emergency cut to UK interest rates to just 0.25% is pouring in. Karen Ward, chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says the Bank\u2019s moves should help the economy -- but government spending would help more: We believe targeted fiscal measures would prove more effective. Rent and wage subsidies and tax credits would give companies confidence in their ability to manage down their costs in line with their falling revenues. This will prevent a vicious cycle of demand weakness leading to job cuts and further demand weakness. In short, interest rate cuts will help, so long as they are playing the supporting act to pro-active government stimulus. \u201cFor that reason all eyes are now on the Chancellor to see if he announces a big increase in spending in his Budget today. If he does this would be the first instance of a truly coordinated monetary and fiscal push. Investors may be comforted by the fact that policy makers are willing to deploy their full ammunition - moving a step closer to helicopter money.\u201d This chart shows how UK interest rates have been cut back to record lows this morning: Here\u2019s our news story on the Bank of England\u2019s emergency move today: This is the full treatment from the Bank of England and significant for three reasons: the timing, the scale and the details, says our economics editor Larry Elliott: He explains: The Bank and the Treasury are working in tandem in an attempt to show they are in charge of events but the 50 basis points cut takes rates back to their post Brexit referendum low and demonstrates just how worried the authorities are. The incentives to banks to pass on the benefits of cheaper borrowing to struggling businesses demonstrate the limitations of monetary easing when interest rates are already at historically low levels. UK interest rates are now at their lowest ever level again. They\u2019ve only been 0.25% once before -- after the Brexit vote in 2016. In an attempt to protect small UK companies, the Bank of England is creating a new \u201cTerm Funding Scheme\u201d. This will provide a \u201ccost-effective source of funding\u201d for small firms, says the BoE. It effectively helps commercial banks to lower the interest rates on their loans, by borrowing cheaply from the Bank (\u2018at or very close to base rate\u2019). It could pump up to \u00a3100bn of extra potential borrowing into the system. The Bank says: Experience from the Term Funding Scheme launched in 2016 suggests that the TFSME could provide in excess of \u00a3100 billion in term funding. Today\u2019s measures are meant to help UK businesses and households through the \u201csharp, large and temporary\u201d impact of the coronavirus crisis, says the Bank of England: The Bank\u2019s three policy committees are today announcing a comprehensive and timely package of measures to help UK businesses and households bridge across the economic disruption that is likely to be associated with Covid-19. These measures will help to keep firms in business and people in jobs and help prevent a temporary disruption from causing longer-lasting economic harm. Following the spread of Covid-19, risky asset and commodity prices have fallen sharply, and government bond yields reached all-time lows, consistent with a marked deterioration in risk appetite and in the outlooks for global and UK growth. Indicators of financial market uncertainty have reached extreme levels. Although the magnitude of the economic shock from Covid-19 is highly uncertain, activity is likely to weaken materially in the United Kingdom over the coming months. Temporary, but significant, disruptions to supply chains and weaker activity could challenge cash flows and increase demand for short-term credit from households and for working capital from companies. Such issues are likely to be most acute for smaller businesses. This economic shock will affect both demand and supply in the economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Big breaking news this morning! The Bank of England has slashed UK interest rates in an attempt to protect the British economy from the impact of the coronavirus. In an unscheduled move, the BoE is cutting interest rates to just 0.25%, from 0.75%. That\u2019s a significant move, intended to protect firms and households from financial distress. The Bank says: The reduction in Bank Rate will help to support business and consumer confidence at a difficult time, to bolster the cash flows of businesses and households, and to reduce the cost, and to improve the availability, of finance. The Bank is also launching a new funding scheme to provide funding for businesses struggling with the economic shock of Covid-19. Thirdly, the Bank is also reducing the amount of capital that UK banks need to hold -- a move that will create \u00a3190bn of extra bank lending to businesses. It\u2019s a major intervention on governor Mark Carney\u2019s final week at the Bank, as global policymakers try to get to grips with a crisis that threatens to push the world economy into recession.
