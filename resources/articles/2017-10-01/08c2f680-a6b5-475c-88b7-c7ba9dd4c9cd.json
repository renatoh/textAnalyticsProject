It\u2019s an ambitious record in four parts, with each quarter representing a different emotional phase of a human lifespan. Her melodies share the courtly poise of English folksong and the psychedelic naivety of Animal Collective \u2013 they accurately evoke the blitheness of youth in the album\u2019s first half, but also, less fortunately, its directionlessness. The textural pleasures of tracks such as I Am Learning and A Kid \u2013 full of wonky tiki kitsch \u2013 are muted by the vocal lines which, given starker backing, would be embarrassingly underwritten. Things improve in the later, more reflective tracks, as the rhythms and melodies simplify and stretch out, particularly on the beautiful closing track To Feel Your Best, underpinned by a faint, watery dancehall beat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
