Of the trio, only Petacchi is a likely starter when the Tour de France holds its opening stages in central London on July 7 and 8. He has been provisionally suspended by his team, Milram, and may find his chances of riding the Tour are in jeopardy. His case concerns a test which revealed an unusually high level of the asthma medicine salbutamol. Petacchi, whose hearing is at 8am on Monday, has a doctor's certificate which permits him to use the drug, but the level found was well over the World Anti-Doping Agency threshold beyond which the substance is considered to be performance enhancing and so requires further investigation. His team said yesterday that they hoped he would be cleared in time to start the Tour. Di Luca and Mazzoleni are not down as possible starters in the Tour, and their case dates back several years to an inquiry by the Italian anti-drugs police codenamed \"Oil for Drugs\". It relates to their involvement with a doctor, Carlo Santuccione, whose premises were raided in 2004 and banned drugs seized. Their hearings are on Wednesday and Thursday. There was good news for the Tour de France organisers yesterday, as it emerged that almost a third of the riders in the teams invited to this year's race have signed a letter that declares they have no part in the Operation Puerto blood-doping inquiry. To date 174 riders have signed of the 600 or so in the elite ProTour teams. The number includes several Spaniards, who have put their name to the document despite opposition from their umbrella body."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
