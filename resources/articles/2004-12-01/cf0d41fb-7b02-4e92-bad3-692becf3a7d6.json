Next to Norway, Sweden may seem to have a comparatively flat landscape and seemingly hostile people, but it turns out that it is just a shy country. Sweden needs a bit of encouragement in order to bring out its best side. Swedes won't talk until they're spoken to, and they probably won't make you laugh until you make them laugh first. This rule does not just apply to the people living in Sweden. It can also be applied to the physical surroundings. When I arrived in Lulea from Norway I couldn't believe how flat everything was. It took a while to learn that Sweden can't be compared with Norway: the two countries, despite being joined by the hip (or perhaps the shoulder), are completely different. I have eventually learned that instead of looking up in search of mountains, I should be looking out (preferably from a boat) and finding beautifully quaint islands. Many towns and cities on Sweden's eastern coast have impressive archipelagos. The combination makes Sweden's cities perfect for weekend breaks with good nightlife and a nice island on which to sober up. I do get a little tired of people telling me it's better to return in the summer. I'm here now, and yes, snow would have been a nice bonus so close to Christmas, but unfortunately global warming has ensured that all of Sweden's snow has melted away, for now at least. It seems Scandinavia is a completely different place in the summer but that doesn't make it a bad place in the winter. To put it simply, Stockholm is one of the best cities that I have ever been to, and it certainly doesn't need snow to impress. It seems to me that Stockholm has the best combination of big city life with its clubs, bars and shopping, and a perfect natural harmony of sea, canals and parkland to relax in. Arriving in Stockholm at a weekend promises to show the city at its best. I arrived on a Friday, partied hard for two nights, drank countless Swedes under the table and left on a \u00a320 business class flight for Gothenburg during the week. In Gothenburg I stayed with Dany, a Swedish friend of mine from London who showed me a side to Sweden that I really didn't expect to see. Three days in Gothenburg ended up being three days crammed with intense socialising and an introduction to everything but traditional Swedish culture. Gothenburg consisted of three nights' heavy drinking - the Swedes are even worse binge drinkers than the Brits - an embarrassing introduction to Capoeira in two languages, neither of which I understood, and the rare opportunity of going ice swimming. I couldn't quite pluck up the courage to plunge myself into ice-cold water, despite this pastime being something of a Scandinavian institution. So the most insightful cultural introduction this week was unquestionably sampling traditional Ethiopian food in a place in Gothenburg discretely known as Etrianska F\u00c0reningen. This shadowy restaurant is discretely tucked inside a set of apartments on Friggegatan, also the setting for Baby Dolls strip club, Gothenburg's ghetto, and a large cemetery with the words 'death is near' written in Swedish at the entrance. How comforting! On my last day in Gothenburg I climbed to the top of Ramhultabergen, a large hill overlooking the city and surrounding area, and had quick look around on a more typical tourist trail before grabbing my bags and heading back to Stockholm. Stockholm seems effortlessly able to extract ridiculous sums of money from me on a regular basis. Not a day passes without one or more visits to an ATM, or an encounter with shop and bar staff all more than happy to swipe my credit card for a small transaction fee. Nothing in Sweden is free or even cheap, but somehow that doesn't seem to deter serious consumption and indulgence of every possible kind. My last weekend back in Stockholm wouldn't have been complete without another night on the town and a reminder of what great, if naive, company Swedes make. My last few days in Sweden were spent with Sofie, a Stockholmer I met in a bar. The plan was for Sofie to show me around, however, each day usually ended up with me showing her around. People who live in Stockholm are extremely modest and don't seem to have the slightest idea what a great city they live in. And they're usually completely lost. I ended with a beautiful ferry trip to Vaxholm, a visit to the less impressive 'Ice Gallery', and a walk around the old town where I discovered a delightful old shop: 'Kolonialboden' in Jarntorget sells an array of ornamental tea and biscuit tins as well as authentic Christmas decorations. The last thing I saw in Sweden was the Santa Lucia festival choir performing in Stockholm's central library. A special treat so close to Christmas, something a little different, and finally, finally, it was free! Flying this week In contrast to the previous week in northern Scandinavia, this has been a very different week in the southern Swedish cities of Stockholm and Gothenburg. Both cities are on the Ryanair's destination map, so getting there for next to nothing from the UK should pose few problems. I decided to try out some of Scandinavia's budget airlines, of which there are many. Sweden's budget airline industry is unique. Unlike so many things in Sweden, flying is cheap and consumers looking for a bargain are spoilt for choice. SAS in Sweden is one of the few remaining airlines that still offers bargain standby tickets. For 300kr (\u00a320) it's possible to fly standby on any internal SAS flight. Had I known this I wouldn't have planned my travel so carefully. My only flights this week were a return trip from Stockholm to Gothenburg. When I booked my ticket through Snalskjutsen, I naturally assumed that this was also the name of an airline. It isn't. Snalskjutsen is simply a website for booking cheap fares on Malmo Aviation. Snalskjutsen doesn't translate exactly into English, but I'm told it means to ride or succeed on other peoples wealth... Malmo Aviation has one queue for check-in - Business class. The \u00a320 airfare not only got me from A to B but it also got me an evening meal, beer, some coffee and a chocolate. I've found myself pushed to get a light meal in Sweden for the same price at times, let alone a flight thrown in! I have also just arrived in Helsinki after taking a flight with Swedish airline FlyMe The flight cost \u20ac33 and is good value for money considering Helsinki is quite poorly served by budget airlines.
