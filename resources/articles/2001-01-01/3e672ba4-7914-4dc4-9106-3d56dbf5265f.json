Measured against present-day political realities, his immediate legacy is the triumphal return of a Republican president, a Republican-controlled Congress and a deeply divided nation. Bill Clinton has many achievements to his name after eight years in the White House; but as George W Bush takes the oath of office today, he has good cause to reflect on what might and should have been. Mr Clinton's presidency lacked an over-arching theme or a guiding principle. Its advances were incremental, outnumbered by its compromises and defeats. In the end the boy from Hope failed to realise his vision of a united, unifying America as a force for good in the world. In this he was fatally handicapped by his own inconsistencies, paradoxes and deep personal flaws. He urged Americans to have the \"courage to change\" but could not change himself. When Mr Clinton tried, he could be very, very good. But when he was bad, like the girl with the curl, he was very bad indeed. Politically speaking, Mr Clinton will be remembered more than anything else for an unprecedented economic expansion that enriched most Americans and sent the federal budget into surplus. Whether this was really his achievement or that of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is another matter. His poverty reduction, welfare and education programmes had significant impact. He was untiring in his efforts to overcome racial divisions and gender inequalities, promoting women's rights and the interests of minorities at every opportunity. He reduced crime, enhanced environmental protection (at least at home), demolished barriers to trade and championed the internet information revolution. Perhaps his biggest single challenge abroad was the promotion of democracy and reform in post-Soviet Russia. Through his cultivation of Boris Yeltsin and US economic aid, he kept relations positive, though that may be changing now. From a purely British perspective, his personal involvement in Northern Ireland brought undeniable benefits. On the debit side, Mr Clinton's hapless start to his first term contributed greatly to the Gingrich revolution of 1994 when the Republicans swept Congress. His centrist, compromising instincts, embodied in the New Democrat covenant (subsequently aped endlessly by third way politicians), alienated core constituencies while failing to impress opponents. The biggest casualty was his ambitious plan to provide universal healthcare. In foreign policy, too, Mr Clinton's reluctance to act boldly, to break with the past and his obsession with consensus, led to the unthinking continuance of Iraqi sanctions and the disabling perception in the Arab world that he was hopelessly biased towards Israel. Burned in Somalia in 1993, he became increasingly reluctant to support UN peacekeeping, averse to humanitarian military intervention and ever more unable to check a growing unilateralist mood. Never was the lack of a guiding philosophy more in evidence as the US failed to act to halt the Rwanda genocide, failed to halt ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and failed to halt the Chechnya atrocities while appearing more and more anxious to appease China's arrogant leadership. When he did act decisively - in Kosovo - it was, for many, already too late; and the consequences, not least for Nato, remain problematic. Mr Clinton never promised to be the world's policeman. But while exercising the prerogatives of superpower, he never quite seemed to recognise the true extent of its responsibilities. In pursuing America's interests, he ignored principled objections to projects like the World Trade Organisation. In defending America's profligacy, he did far too little to assist international efforts to address critical issues such as climate change. Mr Clinton was quintessentially a child of his times, the prodigal son of a fast-changing, postwar America in which traditional mores, old conventions and standards, prejudices and taboos were exploded or cast aside one by one. He brought to his job all the strengths and weaknesses of a man raised in relative poverty who survived a broken home and an abusive, alcoholic stepfather. He achieved a college education where previous generations had none, counted blacks among his friends in still-segregated deep south Arkansas, dodged Vietnam and experimented with drugs. But he was ready and eager to answer John F Kennedy's clarion call to create a better, fairer society. His rise to power, in retrospect as irresistible as iced tea on a hot Memphis afternoon, came with a rock'n'roll accompaniment. In overthrowing George Bush Sr, the epitome of the privileged, born-to-rule east coast establishment, he vanquished a man from a different era who was the very antithesis of Bubba, the boy from the boondocks. At that moment in November, 1992, he changed America's perception of itself. The country seemed to leap a generation or two. By way of celebration, he played sax at his inauguration party as black doormen tapped their feet to a whole new rhythm. Mr Clinton's most powerful quality, and the one that made him such a potent politician, was his ability to involve, stimulate and engage. This very personal charisma was the hallmark of his presidency. But it was this same hands-on style, when applied to Monica Lewinsky, that almost proved his downfall. His presidency was dogged by scandal from its very beginning; but his impeachment was its undoubted low point. Yet even in disgrace, most Americans refused ultimately to condemn him. They knew his weaknesses were theirs, too; he was, warts and all, one of them in an imperfect, changed and changing country. He leaves office with record approval ratings and would certainly have won a third term had the constitution allowed. Perhaps in the end Mr Clinton's most telling influence was his humanising of the presidency, his conduct of government in America's own complex, contradictory self-image. Some say he cheapened his office; others that he abused it. In truth, he brought it back to the people, brought politics down-home after the haughty imperialism of his older predecessors. For the children of the rock generation, he was Dr Feelgood with a dash of Queen. He touched Americans and moved them even if, ultimately, he failed to lead them anywhere in particular."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
