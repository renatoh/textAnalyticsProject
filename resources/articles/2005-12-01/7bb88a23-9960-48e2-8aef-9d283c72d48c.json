But bumping along the tree-lined avenue towards the school, which is set in 30 acres of grounds near Retford in north Nottinghamshire, the visitor might experience something of a shock. The paintwork on the main building is starting to peel. The grass on the sports pitch has a decidedly shaggy edge, and the rest of the school is housed in a jumble of decaying, flat-roofed relics from the 1960s. \"If we had a million pounds we'd make it a Hilton,\" says Bakhtyar Pirzada, the school's vice-principal and the son of its founder. To be fair, there is nothing down-at-heel or depressed about the atmosphere here. It feels purposeful, focused. Jamia Al-Karam is one of a new breed of independent schools that are transforming the comfortable, class-based image of the fee-paying sector in the UK. There are more than 100 independent Muslim schools in England now, of which Jamia Al-Karam is one. And there are stirrings, too, within other faith groups. Of 175 schools listed by the schools inspectorate, Ofsted, last year as being in a \"transitional\" phase of working towards meeting the necessary criteria for official registration, 50 were Muslim, nine run by evangelical Christians and 31 by the fundamentalist Christian Brethren. Inclusive vision In the past, a mainstream independent education has tended to be an expensive luxury for British parents. But the newest parts of the sector are looking for ways to offer an educational alternative without charging a fortune. Jamia Al-Karam's 125 boys, aged between 11 and 16, are from inner-city homes in Birmingham, Manchester or Glasgow. Most have parents who could never dream of paying the \u00a320,000 plus fees of a leading boarding school. The annual fees here are just \u00a33,600, less than one fifth of the average cost of a boarding education. The real cost of educating a pupil here, according to Pirzada, is between \u00a35,000 and \u00a36,000. The school's handful of overseas students pay the full rate, and the gaps are filled through fund-raising. \"This is purely through the vision of the principal, my father,\" he explains. \"We've discussed raising the fees, but he's always said: 'Let's carry on. We're surviving.' He wants to provide this service for everyone.\" The school's history and the vision of its founder, Mohammed Pirzada, help to explain the reluctance to raise the fees. Pirzada senior came here from Pakistan as a young Imam, but saw a need to train British-born Muslims to form a new generation of religious leaders. After 10 years at the head of a small Islamic academy in Milton Keynes, he decided to expand. \"Not only do we need Imam training, we need Muslims in this country who are civilised, who understand this country, but also understand their faith. We need a school to train our younger generation not just to be Muslims, but to be decent British citizens,\" Pirzada junior explains. \"In state schools there are too many influences that can affect a child's study. There are boys involved with drugs and crime. But the biggest factor is underachievement. Muslim boys are not achieving as well as their peers. Why not provide an environment where they can do better?\" The school, a former teacher training college, was bought at auction in 1995 for \u00a3910,000. Most of the money was raised from Muslim donors in a four-week period. \"It was crazy. Amazing,\" says Bakhtyar Pirzada, who was 15 at the time and who has recently returned to run the school after completing postgraduate studies in Manchester. \"Suddenly there were mosques throughout the country donating money. It was unbelievable.\" The memory of this generosity has fuelled the determination of the older Pirzada to keep the fees low. It is time to pay the community back for its help, he believes. And while the paint may be peeling, the school has a fully equipped computer suite and even a single electronic whiteboard - for which, according to its vice-principal, they have been saving up. Academically, it is working. The first cohort of GCSE students completed their courses in 1998 and the school has been top of the local league table ever since. This year, 95% of leavers gained at least five Cs. The curriculum is narrow - everyone does maths, English, science, information technology and history, but modern foreign languages are restricted to Arabic and Urdu and there is no GCSE geography, no drama or art - but it is taught by qualified teachers paid according to national scales. One of the first pupils to arrive at Jamia Al-Karam was Imran Hussain. He was 12, and had been at a comprehensive school in Birmingham. \"I was a normal teenager,\" he says. \"I wasn't too keen on doing well. But when I came here, there were only a few boys and the teachers could give us more time. Because they lived on the site, you could see them at 10.30pm if you wanted. \"There was a transformation. It was like, learning is cool. Suddenly I felt it was much better to be clever.\" Getting the buzz The school toyed with the idea of running a sixth form, but found it too much of a stretch, so Hussain took A-levels at college and then went to Birmingham University do an English degree, followed by teacher training. He even did teaching practice at his old state school. \"The classrooms were state of the art,\" he says. \"But unfortunately the ethos was still the same. You can have all your gizmos, your interactive whiteboards, but if the children aren't motivated you can't get that buzz out of them.\" This year he came back to Jamia Al-Karam to teach English. Hussain's classmates are now accountants, doctors, pharmacists, lawyers. His friends from his comprehensive school, most of them Muslim boys like him, left school at 16 and went into unskilled jobs. Tackling this kind of underachievement is a key aim of Jamia Al-Karam - nationally about 40% of boys from families of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin get five good GCSEs, compared with more than 50% of all pupils. Although this is a faith-based school, providing a religious education is not its only or even its main purpose. It is offering a classless, cut-price alternative to the state system, as are an increasing number of the newer independent schools. As this week's cover story shows, Sunny Varkey, the Dubai-based chairman of Global Education Management Systems (Gems), offers another take on the same theme. Jonathan Shephard, the general secretary of the Independent Schools Council, which represents about 60% of independent schools, argues that the sector already caters for a much more diverse group of parents than most people think. But he says it is becoming more diverse. \"We are in touch now with Muslim schools and we expect a number of them to join the Independent Schools Council. I was talking to the headmistress of two Muslim girls' schools in Manchester. She wants to be part of a wider context than the Muslim sector. I think it's important that they become part of the mainstream. We want to represent society as it is.\" The smallest schools, those that represent philosophies outside the mainstream, will always be separate. Schools like the Sathya Sai school in Leicester. The school, which opened in 2001 and has 25 primary-age pupils, teaches the \"human values education\" promoted by an Indian guru, Sathya Sai Baba. Its headmistress, Usha Lim, says the school is open to pupils of all religions, and that it teaches the national curriculum along with a strong emphasis on moral and spiritual development. When Ofsted visited last autumn its inspectors were impressed, concluding that it was a successful school where pupils learned well and felt valued. \"One of the inspectors was a Muslim and she seemed to want to find out if it was a cult,\" Lim says. \"But she came back and said: 'I have to take my hat off to you.'\" \u00b7 Read all of Fran Abrams's series on independent schools here"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
