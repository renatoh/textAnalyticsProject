In a statement explaining its decision, World Rugby said that after months of research and examining the latest scientific research it had \u201cconcluded that safety and fairness cannot presently be assured for women competing against trans women in contact rugby\u201d. The Guardian first revealed in July that World Rugby was considering becoming the first international sports federation to adopt such a policy after finding \u201cat least a 20-30% greater risk\u201d of injury risk factors when a female player is tackled by someone who has gone through male puberty. In a document explaining its decision published on Friday, World Rugby said that \u201cIt is known that biological males (whose puberty and development is influenced by androgens/testosterone) are stronger by 25% to 50%, are 30% more powerful, 40% heavier, and about 15% faster than biological females. \u201cThat combination of mass, strength, power and speed means that in a direct physical contest, ciswomen in all these domains will be at significant risk of injury.\u201d It added: \u201cStudies suggest that the compounded or cumulative effect of these attributes may be even greater, with one study showing that punching power - a composite of mass, force/strength, and power is 160% higher in biological males than in biological females.\u201d Previously it was thought that such advantages were negated when trans women lowered their testosterone levels to 5 n/mol for at least 12 months - which is the current International Olympic Committee policy applied across almost every sport. However World Rugby said that new research showed that they retain \u201csignificant\u201d physical advantages over biological women even after they take medication to lower their testosterone. All trans women will still be able to play non-contact rugby against women, however. The guidelines also do not apply to trans women who have not undergone male puberty \u2013 as they will not have the gained the advantages of extra testosterone and androgens. It will also be up to each individual federation to decide whether to enforce the policy for the grassroots game. However in a statement explaining its decision, World Rugby made clear the potential added risk to player safety if countries went against its guidelines. \u201cGiven the best available evidence for the effects of testosterone reduction on these physical attributes for transgender women, it was concluded that safety and fairness cannot presently be assured for women competing against trans women in contact rugby,\u201d it said. \u201cAs a result, the new guidelines do not recommend that trans women play women\u2019s contact rugby on safety grounds at the elite and international level of the game where size, strength, power and speed are crucial for both risk and performance, but do not preclude national unions from flexibility in their application of the guidelines at the community level of the game. \u201cTrans men are permitted to participate in men\u2019s contact rugby.\u201d Reacting to the announcement, Nancy Kelley - chief executive of LGBT rights charity Stonewall - said she was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d with the news. \u201cThere is still a lot to learn about the impact of transition on athletic ability, but this does not mean that trans people are not already playing rugby or any other sport safely and fairly,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the world continues to evolve, it is vital that policies expand rather than restrict any sport\u2019s potential to grow and benefit all our communities. \u201cWe stand in solidarity with trans people across the world who\u2019ll be disappointed by this news. We will do everything we can to make sport everyone\u2019s game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
