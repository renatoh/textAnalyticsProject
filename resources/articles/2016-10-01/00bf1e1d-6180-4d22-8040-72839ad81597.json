But given that the midfielder was left out of Sam Allardyce\u2019s one and only England squad, four months after a piece of misfortune scuppered his hopes of going to Euro 2016, he was probably telling the truth. The overriding impression was of a player who was delighted to reacquaint himself with everything St George\u2019s Park has to offer having been recalled by Gareth Southgate for the World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovenia, and Oxlade-Chamberlain sounded determined to make up for lost time. He was a regular under Roy Hodgson whenever he was fit and Allardyce\u2019s decision to overlook him for last month\u2019s trip to Slovakia came as a shock, not that he harbours any resentment towards the man who lost his job as England\u2019s manager in such unusual circumstances. Oxlade-Chamberlain did not get a chance to speak to Allardyce about his omission and insisted nothing should be read into pictures that appeared on social media of him working in the gym during the last international break. \u201cI don\u2019t think Sam had Instagram,\u201d he said. Much as it hurt the Arsenal midfielder to be at home while England were beginning the process of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup with that late win in Trnava, he took it in the right way. \u201cIt provided a kick up the backside,\u201d Oxlade-Chamberlain said. \u201cI have been playing for England since I was 18 and, while I wouldn\u2019t say I took it all for granted, it just seemed to be a part of my season \u2013 to play for Arsenal and to play for England. It was a jolt. \u201cI am not young now. I am 23, so you need to be performing and playing as much as you can to deserve a chance to go and play for England. Being back in the setup makes me realise how special it is.\u201d It was a refreshing admission from Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has had to deal with more than his fair share of setbacks during his stop-start career. He has rarely been able to put a run of games together and it was the cruellest of ironies he missed Euro 2016 because he used a day off to build his fitness by training with the youth team in May, having just recovered from the knee injury he suffered against Barcelona in February. Two years after he hurt his right knee in a friendly before the last World Cup his luck was out again. He caught his studs in the turf, extended his medial ligament and found himself crawling off the pitch in agony. The lengthy absences have had an effect. Oxlade-Chamberlain began pre-season with the intention of working harder than ever but, while he felt his club form was good at the start of the season, Allardyce was unconvinced. It is a surprise, perhaps, that Southgate has taken a different view. For all Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s obvious talent \u2013 the driving runs, the pace, the wicked shots \u2013 consistency remains elusive. He has been a substitute for Arsenal in recent weeks and it is not difficult to see why Ars\u00e8ne Wenger recently wondered whether he has enough faith in his own ability. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to find anything that he hasn\u2019t got,\u201d Arsenal\u2019s manager said. \u201cBut maybe he doesn\u2019t completely believe in himself as to how good he can be.\u201d Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has spoken to Wenger about the mental side of the game, sat back in his chair and sipped from a bottle of water when that quote was read out to him. \u201cObviously there\u2019s times in your career when people doubt you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have good form, bad form, get criticised, get bigged up. You go through spells of trying to find out how much to listen to, what not to pay too much attention to. I\u2019d be lying if I said there weren\u2019t times when I hadn\u2019t lost a little bit of confidence. But the people around me, close to me, were the ones to tell me I\u2019d been playing slightly differently, not as confidently as I had been. \u201cThen I\u2019d look at my game a bit closer, how I used to play, how I played more positively and there had been times when I looked for more simple options. That\u2019s part of developing and learning as a young player. Do I believe in myself? Yeah, of courseI do. But there\u2019s a lot of external factors in there. How much you play, how you play. But I\u2019ve learnt now to get on with things.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
