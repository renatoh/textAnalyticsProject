The Manchester United striker's appointment would be all the more remarkable given that, only last Sunday, his angry reaction to defeat at Chelsea prompted a warning from the Football Association. The 24-year-old had mouthed \"12 men\" into a television camera in disgust at the performance of the referee, Martin Atkinson, yet Fabio Capello said today that Rooney is capable of emulating the likes of Pel\u00e9, Diego Maradona, Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer and Michel Platini by flourishing as a captain. The England medical staff will assess Terry's condition again tomorrow after he twisted his ankle blocking a shot from Jermaine Jenas in training. Yet Capello has stressed that the Chelsea defender will not play \"unless he is 100% fit\", leaving England shorn of all but Rooney and Gareth Barry of their first-choice side against the five-times World Cup winners. The situation may prompt Rooney's appointment by default, though Capello has long considered the striker as a captain in the making. \"He is ready to be a captain,\" said the Italian. \"When you choose who is to be captain you look at who is a leader in the dressing room or who is a leader on the pitch. For me that's really important. Rooney is always a leader on the pitch. In the dressing room he's still young. Less there. But he can be. The captain is John Terry. The vice-captain is Rio [Ferdinand]. They are good in the dressing room and on the pitch but now we need one leader on the pitch. That's why I will choose Rooney if Terry does not play. \u2022 Capello vetoes World Cup send-off party \u2022 Kevin McCarra: Stand-ins face best of Brazil \u2022 Lampard could face lengthy spell on sidelines \u2022 'Show us respect,' Dunga tells City over Robinho \"Why not? I remember the best players in the world \u2013 Pel\u00e9, Cruyff, Beckenbauer, Platini \u2013 were captains, no? They scored goals, too. So why not? You have to be a leader on the pitch and all the best players were captains. They were also captains of the national teams. Maradona is another example. Rooney was not the only one who was not happy [after the Chelsea game] but he will be focused for this game because he will be the captain of the national team.\" That last comment referred to Sir Alex Ferguson's publicly expressed exasperation at Atkinson's performance at Stamford Bridge, though the England head coach chose not to display any frustration he might privately be feeling at seeing his first-choice team largely denied him in Qatar. The Italian put his 20 fit players through their paces at Doha's Khalifa International Stadium with Terry nursing his swollen ankle back at the team hotel. \"It's possible he will be fit,\" said Capello. \"But if he's not 100%, he will not play.\" This friendly has become a test of the depth of the playing pool available to the England coach as the national team seek only a fourth win against Brazil in 21 matches. There is a wariness about the task in hand with Barry, who will start in central midfield alongside Michael Carrick, acknowledging that the South Americans are capable of \"destroying any team\". \"We're lacking experienced and top-class players, so those who are selected will realise they have to lift their game,\" said Barry. \"It's going to be a tough test because we know that Brazil can destroy any team. But we can take a lot of heart from our win in Germany a year ago. The players who featured in that game had to raise their game against a tough international side and we learned a lot from that.\" Capello will give a first start to James Milner, Darren Bent a place up front and, if Terry is unfit, will pair Matthew Upson with Joleon Lescott at the heart of his defence, with the England coach insistent this remains a useful exercise. \"For sure, we thought we would have a first-choice team,\" he added. \"But, for me, it will be really important to understand the value of some players who will play tomorrow. \"I know very well that, when these players play with their clubs, they play very well always. Sometimes when they play in the Champions League or the Europa League, though, they are not the same, so I want to understand what happens when they play against one of the best teams in the world. This could be a blessing in disguise. For me the cup is always half full.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
