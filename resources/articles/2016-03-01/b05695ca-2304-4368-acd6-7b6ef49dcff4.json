Their concern was that the fighting would cause deeper destruction to Palmyra\u2019s archaeological ruins after Isis laid waste to some of the citadel\u2019s most treasured artifacts. But the first images to emerge from the city, known as the Venice of the Sands, suggest that while the damage is significant \u2013 and in many cases irreparable \u2013 their worst fears were not realized. \u201cWhat surprised us was that the damage was not worse,\u201d said Amr al-Azm, a former Syrian antiquities official who is now a professor at Shawnee State University in Ohio. \u201cWe had an idea of the damage and the scale of it even before the Syrian troops went in. What we were afraid of, and what was our biggest fear, was that the offensive would cause a lot of damage to the archaeological ruins as they tried to take the city back from Isis,\u201d he said. Syrian government troops seized the Unesco world heritage-listed citadel on Sunday, ending Isis\u2019s bloody 10-month reign that saw executions staged in the historic Roman amphitheater and the destruction of some of the city\u2019s most cherished monuments. With grand colonnaded streets rising from the desert sands, Palmyra was one of the world\u2019s great historical landmarks. At the heart of Syrian lore is Zenobia, a third-century warrior-queen who led a rebellion against the city\u2019s Roman overlords, and carved an independent state. The city fell to Isis in May 2015. The extremist group destroyed the first-century Temple of Bel, which once stood among the best-preserved buildings in the city, and the triumphal arch that once stood at the head of a grand colonnade leading to the temple. Militants also beheaded 82-year-old Khaled al-Asaad, a renowned archaeologist and the head of antiquities for the ancient city of Palmyra, who apparently refused to reveal where valuable artifacts had been moved for safekeeping. \u201cThe destruction is part of a very skillful propaganda campaign,\u201d Azm said. \u201cThe purpose of these atrocities is very simply to demonstrate Isis\u2019s ability to act with impunity and the impotence of the international community to stop them.\u201d Azm said he and other experts were mostly aware of the damage to the archaeological site as they had been tracking the destruction through satellite imagery of the site and photographs taken surreptitiously by activists living there. However, he said he was only now seeing the destruction to the inside of the Palmyra museum, which was transformed into a court by Isis. Azm said the museum appeared to have been ravaged by the militants, who destroyed dozens of artifacts before government troops expelled them from the city. The advancing soldiers were warned to take care of mines and bombs planted by Isis that could wreak further damage to the site. Maamoun Abdelkarim, Syria\u2019s current director of antiquities, told the Guardian in an interview over the weekend that once this process is complete, archaeologists will be sent in to estimate the extent of the losses, and begin the long process of reconstructing the buildings from the rubble. \u201cIt\u2019s still early days,\u201d Azm said. \u201cThis is all going to take a long time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
