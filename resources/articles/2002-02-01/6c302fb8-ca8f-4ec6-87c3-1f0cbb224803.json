After which a number of former England managers must have been overcome by a collective sense of deja vu. Bobby Robson is bringing Newcastle United to the threshold of a league championship, which is what he was doing with Ipswich shortly before taking the England job in 1982. Glenn Hoddle has begun back at Tottenham much as he started at Chelsea, from where he left for England in 1996. Kevin Keegan looks like winning promotion with Manchester City, just as he did with Newcastle to set off a chain of events which eventually led to him taking charge of the England squad. And Graham Taylor is again managing Aston Villa, his last job before taking over the national side from Robson in 1990. Each man, in his distinctive way, brought something fresh to the task of producing a successful national team from a club-orientated national game. Robson came within a penalty shoot-out of reaching a World Cup final, Hoddle won a qualifying group ahead of Italy, Keegan revived sagging spirits in the wake of Hoddle's tormented departure, and Taylor was the bee's knees until turnip time. None, however, could escape memory's yoke. Images of England winning the World Cup in 1966 continued to pervade the waking thoughts of the country's football followers, an increasing number of whom had not been born at the time. The appointment of a foreigner, Sven-Goran Eriksson, as England's coach was not only a break with tradition, it also provided an opportunity for a break with the past. And remarkably, in less than a year, the Swede has managed to sever everything except the most nostalgic connections with 1966. Those are memories rightly cherished. But the last clinging vines of outmoded comparisons surely vanished in Munich last September when Eriksson's England astonished the world, their supporters and certainly themselves by beating Germany 5-1. Eriksson's need now, as he prepares for Wednesday's World Cup warm-up in Holland, is to keep that result in perspective while he keeps the team ticking over. Extraordinary though this victory was, it would be dangerous to assume that the rout of a moderate Germany side defending very badly will provide a template for success in Japan. Two things should have kept English expectations in check. One is the difficulty Eriksson's side experienced in beating Albania 2-0 in Newcastle four days after Munich and the narrow squeak against Greece at Old Trafford in October, when England were spared a play-off only by Nigel Martyn's saves and David Beckham's stoppage-time free-kick. The other is a pig of a first-round draw which requires Eriksson's team to win a group containing Sweden, Argentina and Nigeria in order to avoid a likely second-round confrontation with France, the world and European champions. Whatever happens in the rehearsals against Holland, Italy, South Korea and Cameroon, this England team are going to have to learn from experience and learn very quickly. Yet if any coach can expedite the learning process to a point where England might make sufficient progress in this World Cup to entertain serious notions of winning it then Eriksson is surely the man. After all it has taken him only 10 months to remould Keegan's leftovers into a winning unit. Eriksson does not say much to players or reporters, he just keeps looking. From the moment he arrived from Lazio he has watched match after match, checking on current members of his squad and sizing up players for the future. Those regularly engaged in the European competitions, particularly the Champions League, will always feature prominently in Eriksson's thoughts because this is international football in club colours. If, by his mid-20s, a talented player is not with a club that will give him this experience then his England chances will be limited. Eriksson's approach is probably the least complicated of all England's managers with the possible exception of Alf Ramsey. He just wants the ball passed simply, speedily and with sufficient accuracy fully to exploit the attacking pace of Michael Owen. If anything is likely to disturb his equanimity it is not only slipshod passing but players deliberating overlong before delivering the ball. \"If you want 15 seconds to play the ball anywhere you have to beat a minimum of eight opponents,\" he warns. England's present situation is comparable in a way to that of France going into the 1978 World Cup with the young Michel Platini. The French went out of that World Cup early but played with sufficient aplomb to promise better things ahead. England would be forgiven a first-round departure this time if they left a similar impression. Eriksson could then be judged on what followed and not what might have been."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
