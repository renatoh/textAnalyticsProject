Henman has met the captain, John Lloyd, and the team's new coach, Peter Lundgren, to discuss the possibility of him joining Andy Murray for Britain's home tie against the Netherlands in April. \"I needed a break from Davis Cup and that was the reality,\" said Henman, who last played for his country in September 2004. \"Having two years out of Davis Cup, I really enjoyed having that break. Now, I'm definitely starting to view it as something that has more appeal.\" Henman met Lloyd and Lundgren on Monday night but they should not pencil Henman's name on the teamsheet just yet. At this stage of his career, the 32-year-old Henman may be slow to commit himself to an event that is more than five months away, and he knows full well that Lloyd would move heaven an earth to fit him in, even if the British No2 left his final decision until a few weeks before the tie. \"There's no rush from that point of view,\" said Henman. Henman would have the option of playing only doubles if he felt the physical and mental workload was too great, and while he has said in the past that he would play only if he could commit to playing singles as well, his attitude seems to have softened. \"I have got a much more open mind. I always felt that if I was playing, then it was all or nothing. But I can sit here and say that maybe if I were to get involved then maybe I don't need to try and do it all. Certainly with the way Andy and has been playing, that's a big factor.\" Reflecting on his recent upsurge in form Henman said: \"In one sense it's a shame that the season is coming to an end as I would love to keep playing this well for a few more weeks. But on the other hand it will be nice to go into the off-season having done well towards the end of the year so I can enjoy a short rest before starting my preparations for 2007. I've really enjoyed the last few weeks and I feel a lot more positive about my game than I did a couple of months ago.\" While Henman takes on Christophe Rochus in the first round of the Davidoff Swiss Indoors today, Murray was forced to pull out of the event yesterday after spending two days in bed with a throat infection. He has been advised by doctors to rest before next week's Paris Masters. Lundgren plans changes, page 10 \u2265"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
