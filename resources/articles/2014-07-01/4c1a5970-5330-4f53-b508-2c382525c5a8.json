Which? said consumers could save up to \u00a3440 a year by ditching popular superfoods in favour of better value alternatives that offer similar health benefits. Substituting a handful of blueberries, at 69p, for a portion of two kiwifruit, costing half the price at 34p, for example, would give a saving of \u00a336.40 a year and the green fruit has a similar amount of vitamins C and K. In one of the biggest single savings, shoppers could save \u00a3268.32 by buying fresh sardines, costing 42p for 140g, instead of fresh salmon at \u00a33 for 140g and still get a good amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids EPA and DHA. The government's food watchdog, the Food Standards Agency, recommends we eat two portions of fish a week \u2013 one of them oily. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: \"You don't need to break the bank to eat healthily. We've found you can swap some superfoods for cheaper alternatives and save a packet while still getting the vitamins you need.\" The consumer group calculated the annual saving that could be made by swapping five superfoods with cheaper alternatives using prices from Tesco.com and healthfood shop Holland &amp; Barrett in early July. The total of \u00a3438.88 assumed consumers typically ate each food twice a week. The notoriously expensive wheatgrass \u2013 championed by celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Elle McPherson as an essential ingredient in a juice or smoothie \u2013 does not count towards your five a day, but a portion of broccoli does. Broccoli is cheaper as well as easier to find in the shops, while both contain chlorophyll, vitamins A, C and E, iron and calcium. Wheatgrass typically costs 90p for 10g while broccoli is a more affordable 11p for 80g. Similarly goji berries \u2013 favoured by Madonna and Mischa Barton but used in Chinese medicine for more than 6,000 years \u2013 can be substituted with spinach for similar health benefits. It is claimed these shrivelled red berries \u2013 rich in vitamins A, B2, C and iron help boost the immune system and brain activity, protect against heart disease and cancer, and improve life expectancy. A 30g serving of dried goji berries \u2013 the equivalent of a heaped tablespoon \u2013 and costing around 53p \u2013 counts towards your five a day. But the dried fruit also contains high levels of sugar. A portion of spinach (32p for 80g) can be a cheaper stand-in, saving 42p a week and \u00a321.84 a year. A healthier \u2013 as well as economical \u2013 alternative was found for coconut oil, which is hailed as one of the best sources of heart-healthy medium-chain fatty acids, notably lauric acid, yet is high in saturated fat. When Which? surveyed 1,032 members online in May, 13% said they had used coconut oil in cooking. The consumer group's nutritionists suggest swapping the product \u2013 which costs 32p per tablespoon \u2013 for rapeseed or sunflower oil \u2013 3p per tablespoon \u2013 saving 58p a week and \u00a330.16 a year. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 July 2014. It originally stated that substituting a handful of blueberries, at 69p, for a portion of two kiwifruit, costing half the price at 34p, would give a weekly saving of \u00a336.40 a year. It is a yearly saving, not a weekly saving. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
