The 20-year-old striker slotted Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s second spot-kick beyond Anton Kochenkov to finally rid Diego Simeone\u2019s side of the anxiety he admitted they were suffering, effectively ending this game and averting a European disaster. That was the first of two goals, Felipe later adding a second on a cold but ultimately comfortable night when Lokomotiv Moscow mustered a solitary shot on target. It had come after 17 minutes. The game was two minutes in when Trippier failed to score the penalty that would have settled Atl\u00e9tico sooner. Ultimately, it did not matter, but at that point it felt like it might. Atl\u00e9tico knew failure to win would leave them at the mercy of the group\u2019s other game, Bayer Leverkusen against Juventus. Under normal circumstances that might not have concerned them \u2013 Lokomotiv were missing their first-choice goalkeeper, two of their best players and were already out, the sad sight of Vedran Corluka carried off with a suspected broken ankle the only moment of real consequence for them \u2013 but these were not normal circumstances. Atl\u00e9tico arrived having not scored in four hours and winning one game in eight. Fifty-nine shots had gone by without a goal when they were presented with their 60th and their best opportunity yet. Forty-four seconds in, F\u00e9lix was brought down. Trippier took responsibility, lining up to score his first Atl\u00e9tico goal. Seeing the Englishman there surprised, although it said something too. The penalty was hit reasonably well but Kochenkov, diving right and off his line, raised his left hand and palmed the shot off the post. Fatalism could be forgiven. Even from the spot, they might have felt, there was no way to score. But there was an inescapable reality here: Atl\u00e9tico are far better than Lokomotiv. They kept coming, Trippier as determined as ever to advance, and they racked up another 11 shots by half-time, F\u00e9lix, \u00c1ngel Correa and Thomas Partey coming closest. By then they had the goal, getting the breakthrough when the referee, Viktor Kassai, was called to the VAR screen, which revealed Rifat Zhemaletdinov\u2019s handball. This time it was F\u00e9lix took it, his shot rolling in by the same post Trippier had hit. \u00c1lvaro Morata thought he had made it 2-0 soon after but what VAR had given, VAR took away, ruling it out for offside. On the pitch, Atl\u00e9tico were not to be denied. Koke\u2019s cross was neatly volleyed in by Felipe early in the second half. Morata headed just over, the ball clipping the bar, and Thomas flashed just past the post, but they had to settle for two and second place in group D. For the record, they had taken 23 shots."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
