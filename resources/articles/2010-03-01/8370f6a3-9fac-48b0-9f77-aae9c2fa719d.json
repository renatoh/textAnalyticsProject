The Bulls were booed off at half-time after conceding a 20-0 lead but their Australian scrum-half Matt Orford led an astonishing turnaround that ended with his compatriot Glenn Hall surging over for the winning try with less than a minute remaining. Orford added a simple match-winning conversion, his third kick from four attempts to add to two determined individual tries that gave him a personal haul of 14 points, as Bradford closed to within two points of the leaders with the sort of performance that the club has desperately needed to arrest several years of decline. It was all the more shocking given the poverty of their first-half effort, when Wigan were outstanding \u2013 and Orford was awful, although he had plenty of company. \"We were rubbish,\" he said afterwards, refusing to use an illness as an excuse. Inexplicably for a player of such a high pedigree, having starred for several seasons in Australia with Melbourne and Manly, he fumbled a couple of passes and kicked appallingly, allowing the Wigan full-back Amos Roberts to launch several counter-attacks. The contrast after half-time was stunning. It was Orford's slick inside ball to Craig Kopczak on halfway that set up a sweeping move that ended with his half-back partner Brett Kearney racing clear to put Bradford on the board. Within three minutes the scrum-half went for the line himself on the sixth tackle and showed great strength and determination to struggle over. He converted both tries and Bradford were back in the game at 12-20. There were no further scores for 23 minutes but just as Wigan could see the winning post, Orford struck again. It was another terrific individual effort that justified his nickname of Ox, as he shrugged off two attempted tackles to plunge over from close range. This time his conversion attempt faded wide but an error from Roberts handed the Bulls one last attacking chance and Hall snatched the most dramatic of wins. \"We can't keep doing that every week,\" said the Bradford coach, Steve McNamara. \"I was pretty annoyed because we hadn't given ourselves an opportunity to play. But that sort of comeback win is as good as any sort of team-bonding camp you can ever go on.\" The Wigan coach, Michael Maguire,, for whom this was a bitter first defeat since his appointment to succeed Brian Noble, knew all about the danger of Orford after working with him at Melbourne. \"He's a crafty half with a good left-foot step and a good right-foot step and, if you let him play, he'll burn you,\" said Maguire. \"The things we've been doing in the last four or five weeks have been of a high standard but they slipped in the second half.\" Yet Wigan had been so impressive in establishing that commanding lead. Roberts sent Darrell Goulding in for the opener inside four minutes, then combined brilliantly with Sam Tomkins to set up a second try for Harrison Hansen and with Sean O'Loughlin for the effervescent Tomkins to scamper clear. When Pat Richards shrugged off a weak attempted tackle by Jason Crookes to score Wigan's fourth in stoppage time, Bradford seemed to be heading for a second heavy defeat in three home matches that would have raised more questions about McNamara's future. But now, thanks largely to Orford, he can plan for a title challenge. Bradford: Halley; Crookes, Sykes, Nero, Reardon; Kearney, Orford; Scruton, L'Estrange, Lynch (capt), Langley, Whitehead, Menzies.
