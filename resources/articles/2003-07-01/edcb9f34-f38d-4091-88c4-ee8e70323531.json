Both have proclaimed that they plan to retire after the Olympics in Athens next year and they endured differing fortunes here last night, writes Duncan Mackay in Gateshead . Backley, in his first major competition since knee surgery, won the javelin with a throw of 85.69 metres to demonstrate once again his remarkable ability to bounce back from physical setbacks. The European champion produced his winning effort in the opening round and easily thwarted the challenges of Boris Henry of Germany and Aleksandr Ivanov from Russia. It has become almost an annual ritual in British athletics for Backley to face a race against time to be ready for the summer's major event. As befits a man who has written a book on sports psychology, mind usually triumphs over body. Missing from Backley's star-studded career, which has seen him win the European gold medal four consecutive times, is a title in a global event. He has only two chances left, next month's world championships in Paris and then the 2004 Olympics. \"The world championships are wide open,\" said the 34-year-old Backley. \"Anyone who is in it can win it and I will be there to do that. \"That was OK today. If I am being picky I should have thrown further but I'm happy with 85 metres and also pleased that the injury had a good test\" In his first competition of the summer, Edwards saw his stadium record smashed by Christian Olsson, the young Swede poised to assume his crown as the world's best triple jumper, who leapt a huge 17.92 metres. That eclipsed by 18 centimetres the mark Edwards had established on his home track in 1995, his annus mirabilis and the year he broke the world record three times. Olsson has clearly been boosted by the confidence gained from beating the Briton in the European championships last summer and has now moved on to a level Edwards himself once existed on. Then, adding to his disappointment, the 37-year-old Olympic champion was forced to withdraw after three jumps because of a back problem he put down to old age. One comfort for Edwards was that his only legal jump of 17.61m showed he is in better shape than a man who has suffered from a virus and who has been concentrating on media work has a right to be. \"If you had seen what I've been doing for the last four months you wouldn't have believed I could have jumped that far,\" he said. \"I'm delighted.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
