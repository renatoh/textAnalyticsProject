Anelka had been warned that his refusal to play in tonight's friendly against Yugoslavia could result in him being suspended, under Fifa rules, for City's trip to Middlesbrough on Saturday and the home game against Bolton the following weekend. However, rather than making a complaint of its own, the French Football Federation wants the Football Association to take up its case, a request that will be given short shrift at Soho Square. Fifa confirmed yesterday that it would consider taking action against Anelka only if it received an official complaint. Even if that were to happen, City believe they can expose a loophole in the system, namely that France did not adhere to Fifa's regulations by giving Anelka 15 days' notice. As the French failed to give Anelka or his club the notice means no suspension will be enforced. Under normal circumstances, he would be facing a two-match ban - but the FA is expected to end any danger of that happening by writing to the FFFsaying that it feels unable to act or refer the matter to Fifa. \"We totally expect Nicolas to play at Middlesbrough and we have never thought anything else,\" said a City spokesman. Zinedine Zidane will also be missing from the French line-up tonight as he is nursing a sore back. Patrick Vieira is also an injury doubt. Vieira's club Arsenal have been given a lift by the news that Valencia's influential midfielder Pablo Aimar is unlikely to play in the clubs' Champions League meeting at Highbury on December 10 because of a thigh injury. The Argentinian was a key figure in Valencia's defeats of Liverpool during the first group stage but sustained his injury at the weekend. \"Pablo has a small tear in his muscle and will need three to four weeks to recover,\" said Jorge Candel, Valencia's chief medical officer. The Spanish champions are also likely to be without Francisco Rufete, scorer of their winner at Anfield, because of a calf problem. Arsenal's Freddie Ljungberg has been named Sweden's player of the year. The Scottish Premier League's chief executive Roger Mitchell looks set to quit his post after four years. An SPL board meeting will be held today where confirmation of Mitchell's departure is expected. Mitchell was left frustrated when his brainchild, SPL TV, collapsed in the spring after Celtic and Rangers vetoed the proposal. The Aston Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman has signed an extended contract that will keep him with the Midlands club until the end of the 2005-2006 season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
