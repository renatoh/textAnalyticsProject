Mike Hytner\u2019s full match report with all the drama is here. And I will leave you with this bantery interview between Fittler and Bennett. How\u2019s this for an illustration of wildly differing fortunes. Bennett has the smug grin of a man staying in \u201ca good motel\u201d. Brad Fittler looks as if he\u2019s headed back to Adelaide\u2019s YHA. Freddy is being interviewed by Nine. \u201cI felt like we didn\u2019t do enough in the first half,\u201d he says. \u201cWe defended awesome and pushed Queensland away a few times. We didn\u2019t get a kick in the first 10 minutes. The tries come from a couple of nice bits of play. I just don\u2019t think we at all dragged Queensland of any energy at all. \u201cThen in the second half I thought that their halves controlled their kicking so well ... it was a pretty strong breeze at the northern end. We just couldn\u2019t get out of trouble.\u201d But wait, there\u2019s more. Cherry-Evans, man of the match, is talking about Wayne\u2019s world. He\u2019s waxing lyrical about Bennett\u2019s aura and his presence, and Mal Meninga has felt it too. \u201cMal I have been lucky enough to be coached by him and he definitely has a presence amongst him,\u201d the Maroons skipper ays. \u201cIt is not unnerving or unsettling but it makes you comfortable and assure of yourself.\u201d Meanwhile, Coates is loving life! Andrew Johns is sideline with Munster and the Storm star is speaking so fast he\u2019s about to bite a chunk out of the the furry microphone cover. Here\u2019s the Joey-Cam correspondence. AJ: How hard is that backing up after winning a GrandFinal and the long celebrations? CM: I have had some withdrawals, especially with my nephew Cooper and Byron and letting me know they have had a good time. Really enjoying camp at the moment. I guess the team has done it really good tonight. AJ: What about going into the game, did you feel a responsibility now that you are a senior member? CM: A lot of young faces in your team. It is a good thing about our team a lot of young faces. There is a lot of hunger in that group and no one gave us a chance tonight. We just dug deep and you would know that, just completing sets and kicking to the corners and that is what we did. AJ: What about half-time? What about Wayne say? What did Mal Meninga say to the team? CM: We were a bit frantic and it showed with the impreltion completions in its red zone and we were fortunate enough they did it. AJ: What did you think when Josh Addo-Carr went over behind the post? What were you saying? CM: I was pretty much swearing \u201cBoys, you can\u2019t lose it. We need to dig deep and Blues are a great outfit and they can score all over the field. We just needed to get up.\u201d If that didn\u2019t excite you, nothing will. Here is Gagai\u2019s dazzling moment. Brimson is one of those new faces and the Titans 22-year-old can\u2019t wipe the smile off his face. \u201cThe atmosphere was crazy,\u201d he says, \u201cand it was a dream come true. To get a win on debut it was awesome.\u201d They are back, baby. To clarify, I am a New South Welshwoman, but credit must go to that Queensland performance. That relentless, infuriating second-half pressure wore away at a Blues side that were sitting pretty with a 10-point buffer, and they crumbled under the pressure. Their attacking plays disintegrated, and forced defensive errors paved the way to a comeback for the ages. Eight debutants Bennett fielded tonight, partly through necessity, but he will be content with this. Here is an early match report with more to come. 80 mins: Thirty seconds to go. Felise Kaufusi is in the sin bin for a professional foul. The Blues have two plays to get snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Cleary to Keary to Walker and they are 10m out with seconds on the clock. But the whistle has blown. 78 mins: NSW are back in possession inside their own 20 and Tedesco passes to Walker, who plays the ball inside the 40m line, Tedesco cops the third tackle on halfway. Crichton is next and the Blues use the fourth to go left where there are plenty of players waiting in the wings. They get a scrum feed and another six. Arrow is clutching at his hamstring. It\u2019s all happening here, folks. 75 mins: Game on, says Addo-Carr. We imagine that\u2019s what he\u2019s muttering as he dives over in the corner to give his Blues a shot at a late, late comeback. There isn\u2019t much time and Cleary will have to convert to take this deficit down to two points. He cannot, meaning Queensland must come up with another try in the last four minutes. 76 mins: The Blues get their first sniff in their opponents\u2019 half in the second half. Capewell snags another set but his troublesome niggle has given out and he\u2019s off. Wighton is staggering off too after being tackled hard down the left wing. 73 mins: Captain\u2019s challenge for a knock-on call on Addo-Carr but it couldn\u2019t be clearer. A waste of a challenge. 71 mins: Cook isn\u2019t at the races at the moment and the Souths hooker\u2019s creative output just about sums up his team\u2019s current predicament. Cherry-Evans has suddenly made a break on that same right edge. He gets rid of a persistent Luke Keary and finds Jaydn Su\u2019a inside 20m but the subsequent pass is too far in front of Gagai and the ball drops into touch. 68 mins: Welch suffers a knock and is on the sideline now for a HIA. Would be a shame if he doesn\u2019t return after that almighty effort. And suddenly it is Queensland protecting an eight-point lead having gone into half-time 10 points down. Some boilover this would be. 65 mins: Jack Wighton has absolutely barrelled into Coates. And wait, what is this? Christian Welch is heaoing the pressure on Tupou and offloads but the ball has hit the deck before Walker can get to it. Cameron Munster chases it into an open field and the rest is simply. Cleary makes a last-ditch play and tussles with his five-eighth counterpart but Munster wins the chase and dives over. DCE makes it three from three. 61 mins: The Blues are on their fifth tackle and the kick goes up. Queensland are at 40m on the fourth and it is back with NSW again. As Cody Walker comes on the commentary team point out he was taken off at the 58th minute of the corresponding match last year.Now he\u2019s been sent into this battle where they are down by two at almost the same point in the game. Capewell has just made a big intercept! 58 mins: This is more of an Origin-esque contest now. What did I say about the Maroons before the game? Never write them off. Do so at your peril. Where they paid for mistakes in the first half, they are forcing errors onto their opponents in the second. The Blues are toiling in their own half and it doesn\u2019t seem to sit pretty with them. 53 mins: Gagai is at it again, setting up Coates for his first Origin try. That young dude we were just talking about. Hunt was the engineer, ran the ball backwards then forwards, then offloads to Gagai who makes his dash down the right. DCE is with him inside but he passes right to Coates and they are over again. Again Cherry-Evans converts and suddenly we have a game on our hands. 49 mins: Right on cue. How about that. Capewell does a number on Gutherson and skirts around him into space. Blue shirts chase in vein in his wake and and Capewell does brilliantly to kick on the run. By some stroke of genius, AJ Brimson is there to collect and does the rest. That try took five sets of six but they got there in the end. DCE adds the extras. 48 mins: But enough about the Blues. The men from the north need to pull a rabbit out of a hat. They are 12m out here and Cherry-Evans flicks to Jai Arrows but suddenly the ball is turned over and Tedesco is in possession. They are trying their luck on the edge a lot, Queensland, and could do with a more versatile approach. 45 mins: NSW have the advantage but Queensland have a history of coming back to win after being down at half-time. Cordner is back and appears to be completely fine. The Roosters skipper is the personification of experience, in comparison to young Coates. The Broncos 19-year-old is debuting after 15 NRL games, which is apparently the fewest since Matt Scott in 2006. 42 mins: NSW are in possession and Cleary is attempting a kick but drops the drop uncharacteristically and possession is with Queensland. Gearing up for the second half now. Players are back on the field and Fittler is saying a few words: \u201cOur defence is fantastic,\u201d he says. \u201cGave up the ball too many times at this standard. We keep the ball closer to the ruck it might help us out.\u201d Most recent reports regarding Murray\u2019s injury are that it is a hamstring. This angle looks awful ... Comment from a Phil Withall: \u201cStrange game tonight, even Gus seems mildly disinterested. An out of season Origin played in a neutral state in front of a distant crowd isn\u2019t really cutting it. Maybe that\u2019s just me.\u201d Not just you, Phil. Perhaps the errors have contributed to this sentiment. The Blues have been more ruthless and taken their chances against the run of play, but it is not perfect footy by any strength. 40 mins: That\u2019s the first stanza done. Queensland will be filthy with this scoreline given their blistering start. But something has just been ... off. A bit of disunity. Papalii has been a machine and Gagai whippet-fast, and this young side are getting plenty of width. But the Blues\u2019 link-up play is smoother, and they are flooding the middle and finding repeated joy down that right flank. 38 mins: Half-time is fast approaching, and it can\u2019t come fast enough for Bennett\u2019s side. The \u2018super coach\u2019 will want to stem the bleeding now. They cannot afford another NSW try before the break. Queensland are 25m out and Ben Hunt gets the ball away Tupou is there to scoop up. Here\u2019s the Addo-Carr try: 35 mins: The Maroons are under pressure but Gagai is there to do a number on Daniel Tupou. This is Gagai\u2019s 13th Origin game and he\u2019s scored 11 tries. This, however, is a try saved. That\u2019s more like it from Queensland. 32 mins: Cordner appears to have passed his HIA and is coming out of the dressing room. Thought that was definitely goodnight for him. Big call to let him back into the action. Meanwhile, Trbojevic is heading down that right side again where the Maroons are having defensive issues. The Blues get with eight metres but Coates is there for the goal-line dropout. 29 mins: Wayne Bennett is doing Rodin\u2019s Thinker on the sideline and he\u2019s giving nothing away. Not like his young side on the field. And those eight debutants must be feeling this getting away from them. 27 mins: Tedesco is away and Cook gives it to Keary through the middle but DCE has knicked the ball off Cleary. 25 mins: Cameron Murray is off now with a knee issue. So both he and fellow forward Cordner are now out. Payne Haas is the only forward left on the bench now. Suddenly the depth is not so deep. 20 mins: Tedesco to the right and Clint Gutherson is there with great hands to lay it on a platter for Addo-Carr. The Blues are getting into a rhythm now, understanding each other. This try has exposed some disjointed Queensland defending. Faasuamaleaui is tricked but it is nothing compared the forward pass that NSW that set so close to their line. Cleary can\u2019t pot his conversion from an acute angle but his side will still be very confident with that. 18 mins: Cordner is down. Geez the captain has had some rough luck. Is it yet another head knock? Yep, it\u2019s an errant elbow, and he\u2019s leaving the field for a head injury assessment. 15 mins: Damien Cook gets a lucky bounce out of dummy half and pirouette over the line. The Blues have effectively run the length of the field here. Queensland will not be happy with that. They have enjoyed all the ball and territory thus far but you have to hand it to their counterparts for some gritty defence. Cleary converts. 13 mins: My word, Papalii is a wrecking ball. To be fair, we knew that already. The Blues will have problems with him tonight. Jake Friend has a chance here and Tino Faasuamaleaui is tackled a couple of metres out. Papalii is closing in on the line. Coen Hess gives it a shot but it isn\u2019t to be. 11 mins: Felise Kaufusi has hit the deck after what appeared to be a head knock. But he\u2019s back up in no time to play the ball. 8 mins: Boyd Cordner is getting into the game. And Cherry-Evans has missed a penalty from point blank position. Interesting that the Maroons have gone into this game without a regular kicker. 4 mins: Much better from Queensland. Daly Cherry-Evans gets fancy-footed and makes space. Dane Gagai is away and Coates gets a kick away before the Blues regain possession. 3 mins: No try for NSW. Josh Addo-Carr is so, so close but loses the ball as he dives for the corner. 2 mins: A knock-onfrom the kick-off by the Blues. Damien Cook couldn\u2019t quite get to it. And Josh Papalii has played the ball on the 20m line. NSW are under pressure from the off. But Queensland can\u2019t make good on their set. The players are out on Adelaide Oval now under an overcast sky, and we are having the national anthem, less than one week after the NRL\u2019s backflip on its decision to scrap the anthem during Origin. Nearly there now. We have seen the Welcome to Country. See it is probably an overstatement given the camera cut back to Stefanovic and co during an Indigenous dance. Bit of backlash about this. Wayne Bennett has been interviewed on Nine and done his utmost not to provide actual answers to questions. He has, however, confirmed the team are staying in \u201ca good motel\u201d. Radelaide at its finest. He also confirmed, upon persistent questioning from Karl Stefanovic, that the debutants are probably nervous. Illuminating stuff. Will it be blue or maroon? Or blue or red (see what we did there!)? More importantly, will you be watching on Fox Sports or Channel Nine? Advice please. The current flicking between television and laptop situation is not sustainable. Here are the full teams. We\u2019re unable to embed the NRL website\u2019s official list but you can find it here. I got ahead of myself with Lee. Poor guy has limped off Adelaide Oval during the warm-up. Sami is in after all. Conspiracy theories kicking off: Speaking of Gould, he revealed this morning that he got Nathan Cleary on the blower ahead of his first game since that misdirected NRL grand final pass that led to a Melbourne Storm try. \u201cI just rang just to see how he was going,\u201d Gould told Nine\u2019s Wide World of Sport. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s going through my head all the time\u2019. I said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry ... I lost a grand final 40 years ago and it\u2019s still going through my head. You\u2019re not going to forget. People say that you\u2019ll forget, you won\u2019t forget. You won\u2019t ever forget it, so don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a day where you\u2019ll forget it, you will remember it for the rest of your life; so get used to that and get over it and just go out and go again\u2019.\u201d I would also like to acknowledge Phil Gould\u2019s excellent efforts to allay fears his Channel Nine commentary is biased. Those NRL grand final haters don\u2019t know what they are talking about. Gus is answering a lot of enquiries on Twitter in the build-up if you are short of a pre-game activity. So Queensland have confirmed Kurt Capewell will start in the centres. The Penrith utility, who will likely replace Phillip Sami in the backline, had been named on the Maroons\u2019 extended bench but suffered an injury scare yesterday. We presume his groin niggle was nothing serious. Brenko Lee is expected to overcome a calf issue to partner Capewell as the first rookie centre pairing in Origin history. Speaking of history, State of Origin turns 40 tonight.NSW, meanwhile, are set to play three debutants in Clint Gutherson, Luke Keary and Junior Paulo. Good evening and welcome to our live coverage of State of Origin game one. In November. In Adelaide. This is a very different series indeed, but what isn\u2019t other-worldly about 2020? Or is Trump in the White House considered normal these days? If you have been glued to CNN all day and following the Guardian\u2019s rolling US election coverage like yours truly, and need to be eased into another genre, sit back and allow us to do the work for you. If you are here, you are no doubt aware of Queensland\u2019s much-publicised DIRE circumstances. Injuries, retirements and suspensions have gutted the Maroons squad and if a star-studded New South Wales are switched on Brad Fittler\u2019s side are surely on track for a series three-peat. We, however are not so sure. Well, I\u2019m not, anyway. As long as Wayne Bennett is involved, an upset is on the cards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
