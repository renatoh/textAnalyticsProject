It has been reported that over 3.5 metres (11.5ft) fell in places. The hazardous wintry conditions led to several fatalities and widespread disruption. Many areas remain on high alert due to the risk of avalanches, with further heavy snow expected as a succession of fronts move through from the north-west. Wintry conditions have not just been restricted to Europe, with disruptive snowfall impacting parts of the US. A developing area of low pressure moved into cold air over the weekend, bringing heavy snow across an area extending from Kansas to the east coast. The snow was particularly heavy across the midwest, with more than 50cm falling in Montgomery City, Missouri. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Pabuk brought widespread flooding and power outages at the start of the year to southern Thailand. The system moved north-westwards through the Gulf of Thailand, making landfall in the Nakhon Si Thammarat province. More than 6,000 people were forced to evacuate, due to fears of a repeat of Typhoon Gay, which killed hundreds of people in 1989. Thankfully, damage was limited and the popular tourist islands were largely spared."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
