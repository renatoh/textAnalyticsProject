The president re-tweeted 60 comments siding with him on those and other issues. Most were from rightwing media figures or Republican politicians. The 46-minute barrage provided insight into what was on the president\u2019s mind before the drive to Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia. One retweet was of a Daily Mail report about the father of a suspect in a school shooting in Denver this week, in which one person was killed and seven injured, being a \u201cserial felon and illegal immigrant\u201d . Many others were aimed at congressional committees still digging into special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, under which Trump was not found to have conspired with Russian election interference efforts but was not cleared of obstruction of justice. The Senate intelligence committee has issued a subpoena for Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr, to testify. With multiple retweets, the president showed his displeasure at such efforts. He also took shots at the former FBI director James Comey, an old foe whom he fired in May 2017, who this week said he thought Trump would have been indicted as a result of the Mueller report had he not been president. Trump also mused on rocky trade talks with China and attacked a leading Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden. Finally, after arriving at his club, Trump tweeted a thought of his own about his favoured weapons in his trade wars and the effects, widely criticised, they have on US business. \u201cSuch an easy way to avoid tariffs?\u201d he asked. \u201cMake or produce your goods and products in the good old USA. It\u2019s very simple!\u201d Soon after that, the president\u2019s account fell silent. The identities of his golf partners were not immediately known. Four hours later, after his round and the departure of the presidential motorcade, Trump\u2019s thumbs twitched again. First, he tweeted a familiar claim that \u201cvoters didn\u2019t care\u201d that he did not release his tax returns during the 2016 election, an action that would have accorded to precedent. Trump claimed again still to be under audit and thus unable to release such information. In fact, audits do not stop the release of tax returns. This week the New York Times reported that it had obtained tax information that showed Trump made huge losses in the 1980s and 90s, of more than $1bn. On Friday, House Democrats issued a subpoena demanding the treasury hand over six years of Trump\u2019s tax returns, as it is required to do by law if requested. The Trump administration has refused to comply with all such demands from House Democrats. On Saturday, Trump said Democrats wanted to make the tax returns issue \u201ca part of the 2020 election!\u201d Then he returned to the Russia inquiry. \u201cSo now the Radical Left Dems don\u2019t talk about collusion anymore,\u201d the president wrote, \u201cbecause the Mueller report said there was no collusion.\u201d In fact, there is no such criminal offence. The Mueller report considered the question of conspiracy, detailing numerous occasions on which Trump aides including family members seemed eager to accept Russian offers of help, actions which might be held to satisfy a definition of \u201ccollusion\u201d. Trump added that Democrats \u201conly want to talk about obstruction, even though there was no obstruction or no crime \u2013 except for the crimes committed by the other side!\u201d In fact, Mueller laid out 11 instances in which Trump or his campaign may have sought to obstruct justice but did not say if he thought the president was guilty, instead leaving the question to Congress. Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, said he judged the president not to have been guilty. His motivations have been questioned by Democrats in Congress. In what might have seemed a telling slip, Trump himself said this week Mueller had found \u201cessentially no obstruction\u201d. Debate continues over whether Trump will be impeached."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
