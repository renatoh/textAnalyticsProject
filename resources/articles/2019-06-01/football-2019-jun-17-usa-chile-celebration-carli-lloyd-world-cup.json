The group stage rolls on, however, and the match against Sweden will determine the USA\u2019s path through the rest of the tournament. Now, first or second place in the group is up for grabs. Here is what we learned from the USA\u2019s 3-0 win on Sunday over Chile. The Americans are having fun, naysayers be darned With the controversy that ensued after the USWNT exuberantly celebrated all 13 goals they scored against Thailand, the Americans were a little more low-key in their celebrations against Chile. After Carli Lloyd scored her first goal, she did her usual fist pump, but then followed it up with a polite, dainty golf clap. Lloyd wasn\u2019t sure whose original idea it was, but Lindsey Horan told her they decided whoever scored would perform the clap. \u201cIt was fun,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cI think it made a statement on the sideline.\u201d So much for their so-called protective bubble that blocks out criticism, eh? The players clearly heard about the hoopla and set out to issue a cheeky response. \u201cThe whole team is having fun with this,\u201d Alex Morgan said. The USWNT\u2019s depth is no joke So, the rest of the world thought Alex Morgan and her five goals against Thailand were scary? They thought Morgan being flanked by Tobin Heath and Megan Rapinoe was a problem? Well, how about Carli Lloyd running at goal, with Christen Press and Mallory Pugh alongside her? It\u2019s enough to strike fear into any back line. No, the Americans didn\u2019t manage another eye-popping score like the 13-0 against Thailand, but Lloyd &amp; Company pummeled a much more organized Chile side and would have had more goals if not for a standout performance from Chile goalkeeper Christiane Endler, who was named Player of the Match, despite her side losing. The American attack managed a whopping 22 shots, nine of them on target, and dominated possession. \u201cTo have the depth we have, to be able to have such rotations and still do well is really important for our longevity in the tournament,\u201d said 20-year-old Tierna Davidson, who made her World Cup debut against Chile. \u201cIt\u2019s hopefully going to be seven games and we can\u2019t have every player play 90 minutes in all the games.\u201d Lloyd states her case She may not want to be part of the second-string group that coach Jill Ellis put out against Chile, but Carli Lloyd will take any minutes she can get to prove she deserves to start. \u201cI\u2019m trying, you know?\u201d Lloyd said after her brace against Chile. \u201cI\u2019m having fun, ultimately, going out there and showing my ability. Like I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m not just making this up: this is the best version I\u2019ve been playing as in my career. Whether you put me up top, whether you put me in the midfield, I can do it.\u201d Lloyd, who will turn 37 right after the World Cup ends, now has three goals in two games at this World Cup, and eight in her last five appearances. Lloyd has been more than upfront about her desire to be a starter for the USWNT, defiantly telling reporters last month: \u201cI\u2019m not here to be a super sub, plain and simple.\u201d That\u2019s what she is right now but that doesn\u2019t mean she accepts it. Asked if her outspokenness puts pressure on Lloyd to perform when she does step on the field, Lloyd shifted the question over to Ellis, who has put Alex Morgan ahead of Lloyd on the depth chart. \u201cI\u2019ve become really fit \u2013 age isn\u2019t a factor, my ability isn\u2019t a factor,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been fine-tuning my finishing. So, the pressure isn\u2019t really on me per se. I think maybe the pressure is on somebody else a little bit more.\u201d Ellis, meanwhile, has already gone on record that she loves that Lloyd wants to start, and again on Sunday she said Lloyd\u2019s comments are welcome. \u201cIt\u2019s a great problem,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cYou want to have hot forwards in tournaments, and they\u2019re scoring goals, which is a good feeling for them, so I\u2019m happy.\u201d The worries about defense aren\u2019t going away When the US routed Thailand, we said we still weren\u2019t sure how good the American defense was. After another comfortable win, this time over Chile, there\u2019s only more reason for concern. Officially the Americans got the clean sheet, but there was a rather nervy moment in the first half. On a free kick, goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher came out to snuff the attack from Carla Guerrero but instead missed the ball entirely, and it ended up in the back of the net. The lineswoman declared Guerrero had been offside and the goal was called back, but it was concerning for two reasons. First, Naeher either badly misjudged the ball or was avoiding contact with an opponent. Either way, she missed the ball completely. Second, if Guerrero hadn\u2019t been called offside on the play and the ball hadn\u2019t ended up in the goal, Naeher may have very well been called for a penalty because she took Guerrero out without getting any of the ball. It was a bad blunder from a goalkeeper about whom there are already doubts. But Naeher has been ignoring those questions and won\u2019t stop now. \u201cI don\u2019t get wrapped up in that to be honest,\u201d she said after the game. \u201cMy focus has always been on what I bring to the team, how can I help this team win right now.\u201d The Americans did preserve their clean sheet, but defender Ali Krieger acknowledged there is work to do. \u201cWe were a bit caught off-guard from their set play \u2013 they kept stepping and dropping,\u201d Krieger said. \u201cWe just need to clean up those little details and be prepared for anything on those set pieces. But I think we did well \u2013 they called it back and we move on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
