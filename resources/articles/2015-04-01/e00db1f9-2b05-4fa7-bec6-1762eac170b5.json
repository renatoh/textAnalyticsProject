Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Didier Drogba were among those at pains to seek out Charlie Adam, whose astonishing 66-yard equaliser felt like the apex of a lifetime\u2019s work, for congratulations and they could do so in the knowledge that a contribution from much closer in had again held off the prospect of a meaningful title race. Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my had attempted four shots inside the first 18 minutes, two of them expertly repelled by Asmir Begovic, but he had no need to duel with the Stoke goalkeeper shortly after the hour. Begovic, overenthusiastically heeding Mark Hughes\u2019s earlier entreaty that his side play from the back, rolled a straight, telegraphed ball towards Steven Nzonzi that was touched by Willian to Eden Hazard and eventually squared for R\u00e9my, in front of an unguarded goal, to make his second decisive intervention in as many games after his late winner last time out at Hull. \u201cHe keeps himself in great condition, even without [having played] many minutes to be ready for us. He\u2019s a great boy and his contribution is already crucial, with these two match-winners in the last two matches,\u201d said Mourinho of R\u00e9my, who was making only his fourth Premier League start for Chelsea. He should add to that number after Diego Costa\u2019s latest injury mishap that resulted in him limping off 11 minutes after entering as a half-time substitute. \u201cEvery striker has this in them, so today when Eden recovered the ball you could see immediately he sprinted to score what I call an easy goal but I love strikers to score easy goals. The tap-in when the goalkeeper has an incomplete save, attacking the ball on a low cross, rebounds \u2013 I love the easy goals from a striker.\u201d It was R\u00e9my\u2019s final touch before being replaced by Juan Cuadrado and a finish that belied the toughness of a game in which Chelsea generally spluttered. A compact four-man Stoke midfield was difficult to play through and continually forced Chelsea to concede possession cheaply. They opened the scoring after their most sustained period of first-half pressure, the exceptional Hazard beating Begovic from the penalty spot after Philipp Wollscheid had fouled Cesc F\u00e0bregas, but the Spaniard and his midfield partner Nemanja Matic were otherwise subdued. That could be said for several other occasions of late but Mourinho has had no thoughts of altering his team\u2019s balance at this stage of the season. \u201cFor me, football is not just mathematics,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen some people write that F\u00e0bregas drops his level because the number of assists are not the same, the number of assists is probably not the same because the player that he assists doesn\u2019t score. I think he\u2019s playing wonderfully well. \u201cI always think stability is very important in a team and it\u2019s not in April that you are going to make important changes. April is a moment of stability and obviously I keep faith in the people that I have trusted from the beginning of the season.\u201d There was less slack given to the out-of-form Oscar, who was replaced by Costa at the interval after an opening period in which he dragged a clear chance wide and struggled to make any impact in possession. \u201cI don\u2019t think he had a bad performance, I just think he was not good enough, which is a huge difference,\u201d Mourinho said. Stoke, who nearly equalised for a second time when Nzonzi clipped a post from 25 yards, are playing with little pressure bar the desire for self-improvement, although a first-half exchange between Hughes and his midfielder Glenn Whelan served notice of their intention to make gains here. \u201cI felt we weren\u2019t looking to play out from the back \u2013 we were allowing Asmir to just kick the ball long and it kept on coming back to us,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI wanted us to get on the ball and control the game, and Glenn\u2019s a big part of that. Glenn\u2019s a senior player, it\u2019s not a problem. I used to give dog\u2019s abuse to my managers, it\u2019s an emotional game.\u201d Adam, at least, showed the bravery Hughes values and was aware of the sense of theatre that his bolt from the blue shortly before half-time would create. \u201cI don\u2019t have the pace to go in behind, so I\u2019ve seen an opening,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the goalkeeper off his line and I thought \u2018why not do it at a place like Chelsea?\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter where it is, I\u2019ll try it. Today it came off.\u201d Man of the match Eden Hazard (Chelsea)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
