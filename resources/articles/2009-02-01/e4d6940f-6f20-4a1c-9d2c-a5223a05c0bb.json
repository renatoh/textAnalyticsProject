Woods, 36, has not fought in 10 months since meekly surrendering his title in Florida to the American Antonio Tarver, who was subsequently defeated by Chad Dawson, and many assumed he would retire then, such was the abject level of his performance in a contest many had believed he was capable of winning. But he has changed trainer, now working with Glyn Rhodes instead of Richard Poxon, and believes he has rediscovered his hunger to fight and says: \"People think I'm finished. I was that bad on that night against [against Tarver]. I might have 'gone'. We won't know until I'm in there. In training you wouldn't think it but we'll see. \"Everything is on the line because, if I lose this fight, I will pack it in. I don't want to go back to European or British level. I'll pick up my plastering trowel again.\" Muriqi is a tough, aggressive fighter and the form line with Tarver, an opponent they have in common, suggests Woods is in for another tough night. The Albanian likes to come forward and force the pace and he was beaten only on a majority decision by the slick southpaw Tarver when they fought in June 2007. But Woods has always produced his best form against hard men like Glen Johnson, the Jamaican against whom he had a magnificent trilogy of meetings with a win, a draw and a loss, and it may be that poor preparations \u2013 including sustaining a virus before the contest \u2013 took their toll when he fought Tarver. Certainly on that form it is difficult to make out a plausible argument for Woods emerging victorious tonight but it may be that the old warhorse still has something left in the tank. If so, with height and reach advantages over his 29-year-old opponent he may have enough boxing skill and ambition to set up another world title challenge against Dawson later in the year by winning a points decision."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
