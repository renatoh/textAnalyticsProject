That's Boris': Tory contest arrives in Bournemouth", "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s got to be Boris,\u201d said Jenny Price as she emerged from the Bournemouth Pavilion theatre after the latest round of Conservative leadership hustings. \u201cI came to make certain I was backing the right man and I\u2019m pretty sure I am.\u201d Price, who described herself as a \u201cwell-retired\u201d occupational therapist from West Sussex, said she felt Boris Johnson had the presence and charisma to inspire and the chutzpah to take on hard-nosed EU negotiators. \u201cWithout Brexit I think Jeremy Hunt would actually make a decent prime minister. He has a good grasp of what is going on. But I think the bureaucrats in Brussels need more than a nice, genuine guy. They need a hefty Boris, yellow hair, hands going everywhere telling them: \u2018This is where it\u2019s going chaps. If you don\u2019t like it, sorry we know where the door is.\u2019\u201d The Tory leadership bandwagon rolled into the Dorset resort as the temperatures soared towards 30C. Sunbathers packed the famous sandy beaches and both candidates appeared for the obligatory waterside photo ops. At lunchtime an organ recital had taken place at the art deco theatre and the demographic for both that event and the hustings was broadly similar \u2013 white and middle aged or elderly. The candidates addressed the theatre separately. Johnson was first up on to the stage and attracted more applause, cheers and laughter than his opponent (though actually the best joke of the night might have been an audience member who put to Johnson that the collective noun for a group of Tory members right now was a' \u2018division\u2019). When it was his turn, Hunt appeared jacketless and with shirt sleeves rolled up. He was calm and gave more detailed answers than Johnson; he received both boos and cheers when he said he would not negotiate Brexit alongside Nigel Farage. Christine Elliott, a retired bank worker from Wimborne Minster, Dorset, who joined the Tory party four years ago, was not impressed. \u201cIf Nigel Farage was on the stage he\u2019d be the one I\u2019d vote for,\u201d she said. On the theatre steps afterwards, Graham Browning, from Wiltshire, said he had joined the young Tories aged 17 and is now 81. He said his favourite prime minister was Winston Churchill. Browning is not a Boris fan. \u201cHe\u2019s a good comedian. He\u2019s expansive and jocular but right now we need someone more serious.\u201d His wife, Doreen Browning, 79, said she arrived wavering between the two candidates. The hustings had convinced her. \u201cI\u2019m for Hunt now,\u201d she said. Simon Lloyd, 72, a former military man and now a financial adviser \u2013 and a remainer \u2013 was also impressed by Hunt\u2019s grasp of detail. \u201cI arrived thinking I didn\u2019t really want to vote for either. Boris is a great showman but he doesn\u2019t have an eye for detail. Hunt sounded as if he had costed things.\u201d One of the younger attendees, Ben, an IT contractor in his 30s, was for Johnson, just. \u201cHe\u2019s the lesser of two evils,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t vote for Jeremy Hunt on the basis that he is a remainer. I\u2019ll take a chance with Boris. If he doesn\u2019t deliver a clean Brexit it could be the shortest premiership ever.\u201d Hunt mentioned several times that his father was in the navy \u2013 a good tactic on the south coast of England but it didn\u2019t wash with Pat King, a retiree merchant navy engineer from Bournemouth. \u201cWe need a leader, someone to push Brexit through,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s Boris.\u201d King didn\u2019t mind the concerns about Johnson\u2019s private life. \u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember John Major and Edwina Currie and David Mellor in his Chelsea strip. There\u2019s always something going on. I didn\u2019t like the way Hunt came across \u2013 those expressive, Tony Blair hands.\u201d Who would he rather spend time with on board a ship at sea? \u201cBoris, no doubt. He\u2019d be much more fun.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
