We are carbon emitters \u2013 and we are making huge efforts to reduce our 2% share of global carbon emissions. In 2009 we set tough CO2 targets, including carbon-neutral growth from 2020 and to cut emissions to half of 2005 levels by 2050. Achieving these aims will bring aviation in line with the Paris climate target. Taxation is a red herring \u2013 not a penny of the billions raised in air passenger duty has been ringfenced for environmental action. Your editorial was dismissive of offsetting, hybrid and electric aviation, and sustainable fuels, but these are precisely the innovations that will reduce each traveller\u2019s carbon footprint. Governments should work urgently with the aviation industry to prioritise bringing these forward. Rather than seek to punish those who fly, the focus should be on giving more people the opportunity to sustainably travel and do business around the world. Alexandre de Juniac Director general and CEO, International Air Transport Association, Geneva, Switzerland \u2022 UK aviation fully recognises the urgency of the climate crisis, and the need for us to do more. In 2009, aviation committed globally to a 50% emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 2005. We\u2019ve seen real progress: cleaner aircraft and smarter flying has resulted in a 3.5% emissions reduction in UK aviation emissions between 2005-2017, while passenger numbers grew 25%. Our long-term plan to decarbonise includes many exciting technological innovations, like electric aircraft, but it is right that these aren\u2019t the full answer. So we are making changes to how we operate. UK airspace \u2013 designed in the 1950s \u2013 is finally being modernised, using satellite-based navigation to fly more direct routes. This would reduce UK aviation\u2019s emissions by up to 10% by (while cutting delays and reducing noise)2050. BA and Virgin Atlantic are investing in sustainable aviation fuels, made from landfill waste and waste industrial gasses respectively. These result in 70% less lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than fossil jet fuel and will be a vital \u201cbridge\u201d to electric aircraft. We already are part of \u201ca global commitment\u201d to \u201climit catastrophic temperature rises\u201d: through the UN\u2019s CORSIA offsetting scheme international aviation emissions will be capped at 2020 levels. Crucially, CORISA will facilitate further international steps consistent with the Paris agreement. Our journey towards carbon-neutral aviation will not be easy, but ultimately, the choice between a thriving aviation sector and protecting our climate is a false one. Tim Alderslade Chief executive, Airlines UK Karen Dee Chief executive, Airport Operators Association \u2022 Simon Jenkins (Heathrow\u2019s third runway plan beggars belief, 20 June) focused on the volume of leisure and commercial travel. He omitted the third source of passengers, and one that, while it fits the airlines\u2019 business model, offers very few benefits to west Londoners and south-east England in general. According to Heathrow\u2019s own data, a total of 80.1 million passengers used the airport in 2018, of whom 24 million, or almost one third, were in transit. While transit passengers by definition contribute little to the massive infrastructure and disruption linked to the project\u2019s road transport plan, they add little to the overall economy other than the sale of millions of coffees, over-priced meals and duty-free booze and fags. This is a high price for increased air and noise pollution and blighted housing stock for \u2013 as Mr Jenkins notes \u2013 a 20th-century edifice that may well be redundant before the first aircraft lands on the new runway.
