In advance of a rule change that could see businesses fined up to \u00a310,000 for recruiting an illegal worker, the Border and Immigration Agency is running an ad campaign, featuring headlines such as \"Arrestaurante: If you hire illegal migrant workers you're as illegal as they are.\" One person who will be keeping a keen eye on these ads is John Mayhead. Not because he has a particular interest in employment practice, but because Mayhead is the new chair of the Government Strategic Marketing Advisory Board (GSMAB), which began work last week. This body has the task of \"ensuring best value for the taxpayer in its development and purchase of communication products and services\" but not in deciding whether what the government says is worthwhile, or even correct. It will assess whether the message is being communicated in a cost-effective way. There clearly needs to be good communication between the government and its citizens. Just like private companies, or perhaps even more so, the government depends not just on delivering the right services, but on how people perceive those services, and the need for better perception of public services has never been greater. Research firm Ipsos Mori recently highlighted the continuing and often startling dichotomy between expectation and experience of public services. A stubborn gap remains between British people's personal optimism and their view of what the government does. Take crime, where the researcher says one has to feel sorry for the government - not a commonly expressed opinion. Crime is falling, but despite huge efforts to persuade the public of this fact, most people remain \"utterly unconvinced\" about statistics in this area. Similar negativity prevails over migration: more than 40% of those responding to the research firm's survey felt local public services such as education and healthcare would be unable to cope with the increase in population from immigration. Such public pessimism about the efficacy of public policies makes gloomy reading for public managers. But the public sector has to continue trying to get its message over, even if this is an uphill task, as with, for instance, trying to convey the benefits of its substantial investment in technology in NHS administration systems. GSMAB will provide \"independent validation\" that strategic marketing by central government departments is \"effective, transparent and efficient\". So it does have some remit to look at the effectiveness of marketing and advertising campaigns carried out by government bodies. It replaces a previous body, the Advisory Committee on Advertising, which had a more narrowly defined role, looking only at campaigns organised by the Central Office of Information (COI). These days, COI handles less marketing spend than it used to; departments often prefer to run their own campaigns, so it makes sense to take a wider look at what has happened in central government marketing as a whole. What the board will hope to spot, and cut out, are obvious duplications in marketing efforts, which can easily happen in the huge, tribal Whitehall village. What it will not do is tell the government what it should, or should not, be communicating. So if a minister decides pepper is dangerous, the board will assess whether that message has been communicated to the public - not whether pepper is, in fact, a lethal substance. That is because the board is part of the governance machine. It is not for the board to formulate ministerial policy or tell politicians what they should be telling the people. If a minister opts for a diktat that all cars must be painted pink, then so be it. It is the classic divide between policy and delivery. Does this make sense in an environment where public pessimism about the services they get from government may, in itself, hinder the efficacy of those services? Getting the message over about effective government policies is clearly a huge and complex task and perhaps there is room in the government for a more proactive body, one able to suggest more creative ways for the government to get over its messages, and to decide, in some cases, which messages those should be. There is all too large a gap at the moment between the investment government makes in its services and the way it communicates its intentions to its citizens. If there is a failing, it's certainly not right to shoot the messenger - but perhaps government needs to consider new ways to get its messages across. \u00b7 Jane Dudman is associate editor of Public, the Guardian's monthly magazine for public services professionals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
