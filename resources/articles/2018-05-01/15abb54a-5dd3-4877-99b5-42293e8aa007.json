Please do not add spoilers from later episodes. It has been 10 months since Offred was bundled into the back of a government van, but, for her, no time has passed at all as she drives off to meet her fate. Before we discuss the horrors of the current regime, let\u2019s ease ourselves in with a look at the US before Gilead. The before time In series one, June\u2019s domestic life with Luke provided sunny relief from the oppressive greens of Gilead. Now, while the cinematography still says \u201ca world you recognise\u201d, the timelines are starting to merge; June\u2019s happy family is becoming aware of the changes going on outside their apartment. The happy couple smile as they agree they would like another baby. Optimism for the future is particularly hard to stomach at this juncture. When we see June again, looking out at a vivid street scene from her office window, she is called away to a poorly Hannah, who has been taken to hospital. Her dressing down by the doctor for being a working mum is a hint of what is to come. She is angry, but she brushes it off. It is only when she arrives home to see Luke gawping at the TV that they both begin to understand that everything is going to change. The \u201cbefore\u201d scenes in future episodes can only start to blend with present-day Gilead. Where will we get our visual relief now? Canada? Gilead It is back to the sludge-green sterility and chilly sunbeams of religious oppression. Free of Margaret Atwood\u2019s direct influence on the plot, the writing focuses heavily on brutality. God, it is horrible. After refusing to stone Janine, the handmaids from Offred\u2019s district are rounded up and forced to endure a fake execution, herded, beaten, bridled and threatened with angry dogs. As Offred joins the throng of crying, shaking women, a leather bridle covering half her face, we are forced again to look into the dehumanised eyes of women who think they are going to be slaughtered. It is more gruelling to watch than any number of ear-slicings or hand-burnings. Gilead rules not with fear, but with the abject terror of the removal of humanity. Those eyes are what I can\u2019t stand. As the executioner declares: \u201cBy his hand,\u201d and Offred\u2019s neighbour wets herself, the gibbets fail to drop and I look away for a few beats, snowflake that I am. \u201cOur father who art in heaven, seriously? What the actual fuck?\u201d says Offred in the voicover as the titles announce season two. Welcome back to Gilead. I am glad she said it; the tiny release it provides after 11 minutes of hell is welcome, if brief. The punishment is far from over for the handmaids, who are forced to stand in the rain all day, holding a rock out in front of them in one hand. Only Offred is excused, when Aunt Lydia discovers her pregnancy. The scene between them in the repurposed gymnasium, bowl of soup going cold on the table, demonstrates Offred\u2019s hardening and the one power she still holds \u2013 her fecundity. Lydia can burn and subjugate, but she can\u2019t damage the cargo and Offred has clearly decided she can take the pain. Her scar tissue is now rock hard. We get our first sight of Fred and Serena at the doctor\u2019s office as they come to admire the scan of their baby. It is crucial for them to see the tiny white shape wriggle before Offred rips it away from them. There is brutality on both sides, although obviously Gilead\u2019s is 10m times worse. As everyone leaves the room, the medic calls Offred \u201cJune\u201d and adrenaline courses through her like electricity. She finds a key in her boot and shoots down a staircase, not knowing where it leads. Even the back of a cold-storage truck full of slaughtered carcasses holds no fear for her as she is shut in and driven away. Icy suffocation is the preferred option over enforced incubation in harness. This series makes me want to be a vegetarian. Finally at her destination, the kindly lorry driver gets a hug for his trouble as June is greeted by Nick, who was on her side after all. She is June again as she burns the handmaid\u2019s dress and cuts the metal tag from her ear, blood splashing down her neck. It is Reservoir Dogs levels of appalling, but necessary. \u201cMy name is June Osborne ... I am free,\u201d she tells us, bloodied jaw jutting to the horizon. The sound of music This week\u2019s musical cues kind of worked. Kate Bush singing This Woman\u2019s Work as the noose-wearing women wait for death is particularly effective. I am less sure about Going Back Where I Belong by Sugar Pie DeSanto over the end credits. The music so often sounds like June spinning something from her record collection on her internal jukebox, like a defiant teen. I guess, in this context, anything goes. Blessed be the fruit. May the Lord open. Grimness scale This week\u2019s episode reads a solid 10 on the grimness scale, with one being a bit of shouting and 10 being all-out mental and physical brutality. Under his eye That glimpse of Ofwyatt, chained in a basement and heavily pregnant, bothered me mostly because I couldn\u2019t see anything for her to use as a toilet. Pregnant ladies need to go to the loo a LOT. June\u2019s self-surgery on that ear tag will be talked about for sure. But did we need to see the act itself? Like the burning of Ofrobert\u2019s hand, I think it is better our brains do the work here. Is a post-Atwood story going to rely this heavily on physical and mental hardship as a replacement for narrative complexity? I hope not. But I am more than convinced June\u2019s story has life in it yet. When June torched her red dress, I worried about the plume of smoke being seen by the guards. It looked cool, but so dangerous."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
