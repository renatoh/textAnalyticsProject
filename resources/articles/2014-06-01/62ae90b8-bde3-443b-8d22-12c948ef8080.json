The famous albino whale is travelling with at least four other whales as part of the seasonal migration of humpbacks to warmer waters The white humpback, first noticed in 1991, was sighted off the coast of Eden on Wednesday, and then Cronulla, south of Sydney, on Thursday afternoon. A Port Stephens-based Twitter account reported a sighting on Friday morning. He is travelling with at least four other whales as part of the seasonal migration of humpbacks to warmer waters. Although Migaloo\u2019s rough itinerary can be figured out, it is still a lucky whale watcher who spots him, Oskar Peterson, from the White Whale Research Centre, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThere were a couple of years after 1991 when we didn\u2019t see him at all, and there\u2019s been a couple of years when he goes missing in action,\u201d said Peterson. \u201cHe glows, you can\u2019t really miss him when you do see him out there from a distance, and it\u2019s like fluorescent blue when you see him up close.\u201d Migaloo, whose name is an Aboriginal word for \u201cwhite fella\u201d, was the only known white whale in the world until 2011 when an all-white calf was filmed. It is not known how old he is, but Peterson said he has had reports of the birth of a white whale in 1988, which could have been Migaloo. Humpback whales can live to about 80 years of age. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be around for a few generations,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a bit of an ambassador for the whale watching tourism.\u201d Whales are frequently spotted off the east coast around this time of year, as the humpback population of about 15,000 migrate to warm waters to breed after spending the summer in Antarctica. While many people take to the water in boats to watch the whale migration, there are strict rules in place to prevent harassment of the animals, including restrictions of up to 300m on how close people can get. Migaloo has \u201cspecial status\u201d in New South Wales and Queensland. Watchers must stay at least 500m away \u2013 600m for aircraft and jetskis \u2013 and there are heavy fines for breaching the laws. Peterson\u2019s organisation, a collaboration of marine biologists from Lismore\u2019s Southern Cross university and a number of other marine professionals, has tracked and aggregated information about Migaloo over the years, hoping to raise awareness about the threats to whale populations and their surrounds. \u201cIt\u2019s about educating the world population of the dangers and lack of understanding of the marine environment, the Great Barrier Reef in particular,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the years it\u2019s gotten bigger and bigger and people ring up and send emails, and over the year we get a clear picture,\u201d said Peterson. \u201cThen, with the invention of Twitter, it\u2019s gone ballistic.\u201d Peterson said since Migaloo\u2019s sighting off Sydney on Thursday the organisation\u2019s account had gained several hundred new followers overnight, from all over the world. \u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal. There\u2019s so much interest in this white whale.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
