There is talk of cuts of 33%. Universities will have to wait until later this week for his thoughts on the balance to be struck between quantity of places and the quality of research. But on Friday the universities minister, David Willetts, in a speech that underlines how far he has come since he was a key figure at Margaret Thatcher's court, praised the record of British research and spoke enthusiastically about the contribution the state can make to supporting scientific endeavour. Scientists who in previous Tory (and Labour) governments have felt valued only for their potential to contribute to economic wellbeing will have noted and welcomed Mr Willetts's recognition of the role that science and scientific method can play as a common denominator in an increasingly diverse society. But, as the minister observed, science is not only a good thing in itself. In austere times the economic impact of research matters, even if assessing it is only a fledgling science \u2013 so uncertain that Mr Willetts announced a one\u2011year delay in introducing a new system to direct public money into the best-performing areas, to allow for a longer appraisal. All the same, there is evidence suggesting that funding distributed through the UK research councils delivers the biggest and broadest benefits: every 1% of publicly funded research and development, according to an OECD survey, produces a 0.1% gain in overall productivity. And by current evaluation methods, British universities have a good tale to tell, second only to the US in research funding, and world leaders in research productivity \u2013 while expanding access by 500,000 between 1998 and 2008. But higher education spending doubled in the Labour years, and even before the election it was clear there was going to be a severe retrenchment. Lord Browne's inquiry into tuition fees looms over the autumn. At the same time, a record number of disappointed applicants for degree courses is anticipated as the number of applications soars by 20% just as universities scale back the number of places on offer to accommodate cuts that have already been imposed. Scientific excellence or student numbers: there are persuasive arguments for both. The top universities claim unique benefits from clusters or centres of research where different disciplines feed off each other, able to compete internationally and respond to international developments. Mr Willetts pointed to the newly opened Harwell Science and Innovation Campus as a model of public investment in a research platform for the private sector. But, as David Miliband said in an under-reported speech last month, access matters more. In economies such as South Korea, more than half of school leavers go on to university. Future prosperity depends on a highly skilled population \u2013 yet Dr Cable has already suggested that the 50% target is unachievable. It is true that even sustaining the current levels of access may involve radical rethinking. The present higher education model is not the only one: a system that evolved to meet the demands of an elite in medieval times is unlikely to be a viable or even a desirable way of equipping a majority of the 21st-century nation. Cheaper first degrees \u2013 shorter courses and distance learning \u2013 may be part of the solution to expansion in straitened times. It may be necessary, as long as it does not damage access, to accept tough implications for student charges (something the Lib Dems in the coalition would struggle to accept). Mr Willetts promised no government micromanagement of university research: but the universities can't have the money if they don't take the students."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
