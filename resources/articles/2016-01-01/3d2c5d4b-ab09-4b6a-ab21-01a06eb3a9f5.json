The 34-year-old needs Manchester City to discover what he means on Wednesdayas the old place is proving more problematic to Everton this season than most of its guests. \u201cThere are definitely two sides to Goodison and we have got to use it to our advantage,\u201d the veteran insists. It can be a mark of the underdog to talk up a crowd\u2019s influence before an important cup tie, as Barry and Roberto Mart\u00ednez have done before the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg, but there are more significant reasons for the current focus on the mood at Goodison. Wednesday\u2019s semi-final represents a test of Everton\u2019s emerging talents and supporters\u2019 faith in the long-term approach Mart\u00ednez espouses as the club\u2019s best way of delivering silverware and top-four finishes. There have been signs of erosion recently with Everton\u2019s lauded attacking style yielding just one win in six matches and three wins from 11 Premier League home games all season. City were among the eight to depart with points after a 2-0 win in August and Mart\u00ednez\u2019s team, keen to maintain the initiative on home soil even at the expense of closing out games, have conceded 20 league goals at Goodison this term compared with nine away. Tim Howard has reacted to sarcastic cheers from the Gwladys Street after collecting routine crosses in the last two games. John Stones urged the Park End to get off his back having performed three Cruyff turns in his penalty area during the final stages of Sunday\u2019s draw against Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 successfully, it should be said \u2013 when groans followed Everton throughout the contest. The longing for a first trophy since 1995, in a competition Everton have never won, heightens the anxiety surrounding City\u2019s visit. Barry admits: \u201cYou will feel that tension in the air. This club is waiting to make the step to Wembley. The players are aware of that. I am. It is down to us to get on the pitch and achieve the performance that will set us up to get through. We never seem to make things easy for ourselves at Everton and at City it was the same, having to come from behind to get ahead in the big games. But we have to be confident that we can beat them. \u201cFor me, Goodison is the toughest away ground to come to. I have experienced it. At the minute we are not using that to our advantage for some reason. That is what we need to set up on Wednesday. If you are an opposition player and you want to take a touch but the crowd is on your back, it is a difficult place to play. Under the lights here, the atmosphere is that much stronger. We need to use that to our advantage.\u201d The midfielder, a Premier League and FA Cup winner during his four seasons at City, cites a 1-0 defeat against David Moyes\u2019s Everton in January 2012 as evidence of Goodison\u2019s ability to intimidate both sides. Barry recalls: \u201cThe one when Gibbo [Darron Gibson] scored stands out because I saw both sides of Goodison that night. We were on top in the first half and I remember the home crowd getting on the Everton players\u2019 backs. I thought to myself: \u2018We\u2019ve got them here because they are feeling the pressure.\u2019 Then, all of a sudden, a couple of challenges turned it around. We started feeling it then. There are definitely two sides to Goodison and we have got to use it to our advantage. Any crowd that gets on your back makes it difficult but you are going to get that if things aren\u2019t going well. The fans have got their right to give their opinion.\u201d Opinion on Barry has been universally positive at Everton this season. Without the demands of European football, which took a toll last season, the midfielder\u2019s control and composure continue to impress and prompted Mart\u00ednez to proclaim recently that the former England international could continue until the age of 40. Ryan Giggs and Frank Lampard are the two players to have made more Premier League appearances than Barry, who is now 27 games behind Lampard\u2019s 609. \u201cI feel good for my age,\u201d he admits. \u201cThere are not too many players my age playing regularly in the Premier League. It\u2019s a good feeling and it\u2019s great to hear from the manager because that gives you confidence. I just take it a season at a time because I know in football things can change so quickly.\u201d Barry has 18 months remaining on his Everton contract and one clear ambition. His old club present a formidable obstacle to achieving it. \u201cI\u2019ve played against Manchester City three times since I left and have lost them all!\u201d he reflects, ominously from a royal blue perspective. \u201cPeople have been on their backs, saying they wait until they need to turn it on, but the quality is obviously there. When it comes to the business end they will produce and, for me, they are the favourites to win the league. \u201cIt\u2019s just another game, though. Manchester City are just another team that needs to be beaten and standing in our way of achieving the ambition of lifting a trophy for Everton. The last two years of my career at Everton, I want to win a trophy. I managed to do it at City, being part of a group that ended a long wait for a trophy, and to do it here would be fantastic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
