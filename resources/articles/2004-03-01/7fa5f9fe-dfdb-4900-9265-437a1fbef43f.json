Although the judge, vice chancellor Leo Strine, reserved his worst criticism for former Hollinger boss Lord Black, he also said the reclusive Barclays were also \"less than fully candid\" and \"remained silent while Lord Black misled the [Hollinger] International board\". Today, Sir David said that neither he nor his brothers colluded with Lord Black behind the backs of the Hollinger International board to take control of the papers. Sir David argued that they negotiated with Lord Black in good faith and believed he was free to sell the company. \"Sir David Barclay had been assured by Lord Black, who was himself advised by eminent US corporate counsel, that he was free to negotiate and sell his shares,\" said the statement. Therefore, argued Sir David, there was no need to disclose the negotiations to anyone, including investment bank Lazard or Hollinger International, until they were complete. During the trial, it emerged that the Barclay brothers had made first contact with Lord Black in May last year, but the Tory peer kept rebuffing their offers to talk about a sale - until late last year, when he changed his mind. At around the same time, Lord Black was forced to resign as chief executive of Hollinger International after admitting accepting a series of unauthorised payments, though he has always denied any wrongdoing. Sir David said he \"received assurances from Lord Black that he was free to enter into the agreement with Press Holdings International Limited [the brothers' privately held company] and only then was the agreement signed in good faith, having consulted with US legal advisors.\" Sir David also refuted the judge's suggestion that by agreeing to buy Lord Black's stake in Hollinger Inc - which would have given them a controlling stake in the Telegraph - they derailed the separate sale process being conducted for Hollinger International by Lazard. He also insisted they knew nothing of Lord Black's attempt to pass new bylaw amendments that gave him the right of veto over any potential sale. The Delaware judge had also cast doubt over Sir David's claim that he was too ill to travel. This was, said Sir David, \"particularly regrettable, as the medical evidence before the court\" was not challenged by Hollinger International. Hollinger International said yesterday that it was moving ahead with the auction of its newspapers and that the Barclay brothers were still welcome to bid. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
