A decadent neon playground, a city boasting the world's greatest number of billionaires and where money can buy any pleasure; chemical or carnal. But now Moscow, keen to bolster its image as an international centre for business and tourism, is cleaning up its act. Nightclubs are now subject to a 'voluntary' scheme under which they must certify their premises as a 'clean zone' where partygoers do not take drugs. Children under 14 are not allowed out after 10pm unless they are with a responsible adult. The moves come after years of expensive renovations financed by the Moscow city mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, which have helped make the former Soviet capital the third most expensive city to live in the world. But while the car parks at the top clubs are jammed with Humvees, BMWs and Mercedes, the side streets of the city outskirts are often abuzz with prostitution and drug dealing. President Vladimir Putin recently labelled spiralling drug addiction a threat to national security and urged his officials to do more to combat the estimated four million drug addicts in Russia. Vasili Goloborodov, officer of the Moscow department for state narcotics control, said stricter controls in Europe meant Russia was no longer a transit point for drugs for a more lucrative western market, but had become a market itself. Parental involvement is sought in keeping on a leash Moscow's army of delinquents, who can be seen in its parks and squares drinking beer. The government has been trying to impose a curfew on under-18s, and last month succeeded in pushing through a law barring under-14s from public places after 10pm. If they are caught without a responsible adult, they could face a fine of up to \u00a38,000. Efforts to make Moscow a European capital on a par with Paris or Berlin have been concentrated on the city centre, where some of the old-fashioned kiosks and grimy caravans have been swept away. Those which, to the fury of US media companies, used to sell pirated DVDs and CDs have been moved on. Even the city's prostitutes, whose pimps often work with the protection of the police, occasionally feel the pressure. Nikolai, an aid worker with prostitutes, said: 'During recent national holidays and elections there were several campaigns to remove the girls temporarily from Moscow. The girls - who are brave and have seen a lot - flee with panic when the riot police arrive.' He said pimps worked with police, paying \u00a3250 a night for a spot on a central street."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
