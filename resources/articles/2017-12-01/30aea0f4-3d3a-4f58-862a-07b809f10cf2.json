The finer points of this question were subject to much legal sparring on Tuesday when a lawyer for Donald Trump argued for the dismissal of a lawsuit that threatens to reignite one of dozens of accusations of sexual assault facing the president. The lawsuit was brought by a former contestant on The Apprentice, Summer Zervos, who claims Trump kissed her and groped her breast during a 2007 meeting to discuss business opportunities at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Trump thunderously denied her accusations, along with those of other women he called politically motivated liars. Zervos is suing Trump for defamation. Or rather, she\u2019s trying. In a hearing before a New York judge, Jennifer Schechter, to determine the case\u2019s future, Trump\u2019s attorney Marc Kasowitz argued that Zervos shouldn\u2019t be allowed to proceed with her suit. Trump\u2019s denials were political speech, he said, protected from legal action, and a lawsuit would prevent the president, who holds a singular office, from performing his job. \u201cThe president is the person who runs the executive branch,\u201d Kasowitz said. \u201cHe needs to be available 24/7.\u201d The potential impact of Zervos\u2019s lawsuit, if she is allowed to proceed, is immeasurable. It would almost certainly link Trump\u2019s name more permanently to the scores of powerful men recently accused of sexual misconduct. There is a chance Trump could be compelled to testify, something that led to Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment proceedings when he was revealed to have lied under oath. Her lawsuit could also expose Trump, who faced roughly 75 lawsuits when he assumed the presidency, to a flood of litigation. For political observers, the case brings a wave of deja vu. In 1997, the US supreme court ruled a president could be sued for private conduct that took place before he assumed office. The lawsuit in question was brought against Clinton by Paula Jones, on claims that he sexually harassed her. But attorneys for Trump have said the supreme court ruling does not apply to New York state law. On Tuesday, a member of Zervos\u2019s legal team, Mariann Meier Wang, called those arguments \u201ccreative arguments out of a footnote in Clinton v Jones\u201d. \u201cWhat better court to hear a defamation claim against a born and bred New Yorker who made many of his defamatory statements just up in Midtown?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe do not dispute that the president holds a singular office, but the individual who holds that office is not above the law.\u201d Zervos accused Trump of assault in October 2016 at the law offices of the women\u2019s rights attorney Gloria Allred, who is also representing her in her suit. She said Trump, during their 2007 encounter, greeted her for a meeting to discuss job opportunities with an open-mouthed kiss, then attempted to steer her toward the bedroom of the bungalow where they met. \u201cLet\u2019s lay down and watch some telly-telly,\u201d she claimed he said. When she replied, \u201cC\u2019mon man, get real,\u201d he repeated after her \u2013 \u201cGet real\u201d \u2013 and thrust his genitals at her. On the campaign trail, Trump called her accusations and others\u2019 \u201cphoney\u201d, \u201c100% false\u201d and \u201coutright lies\u201d made for political or monetary gain. Schechter did not immediately rule on whether the case could proceed. And there were signs that she would weigh not just the specifics of existing case law, but also the unprecedented nature of the Trump presidency in making the call. Can Trump be held liable for a retweet? the judge asked. Yes, said Wang, if it constituted a \u201csubstantive addition to the commentary\u201d. At one point, Schechter asked what would happen if the president simply refused to follow one of her orders. Wang said she didn\u2019t think that would be a problem. Schecter seemed sympathetic to arguments that Trump is, in contrast to what his lawyers have said, not incapable of participating in a lawsuit while doing the duties of his office. If the lawyers\u2019 claim were true, she said during Wang\u2019s arguments, Congress would have changed the law after Jones sued Clinton. But in his rebuttal, Kasowitz argued that Trump\u2019s harshest remarks about his accusers \u2013 such as saying they were \u201cliars\u201d motivated by money \u2013 weren\u2019t specific to Zervos herself but to \u201cgeneralized, broad and vague charges\u201d. He added that speech made in the flurry of a political campaign, at rallies and in press releases was \u201cprotected political speech\u201d. \u201cAlthough events happened almost a decade ago, [Zervos] saw fit, three weeks before the election, to come forward and make claims about the president that the president denied, but to make claims that would be damaging to the election the president was engaged in at that time,\u201d Kasowitz said. \u201cShe started a back-and-forth,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s politics.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
