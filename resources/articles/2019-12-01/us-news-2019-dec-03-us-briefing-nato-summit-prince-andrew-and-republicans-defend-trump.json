Report offers blueprint to Trump\u2019s congressional defenders Republicans have released a 123-page draft report on last month\u2019s impeachment hearings. Defending the president over his dealings with Ukraine, it describes his actions as \u201centirely prudent\u201d and involving \u201cno quid pro quo, bribery, extortion, or abuse of power\u201d. The document is designed to act as both a pre-emptive strike against a Democratic report and as a blueprint for Trump\u2019s GOP defenders at future impeachment hearings and prospective Senate trial.

Trump\u2019s re-election could doom Nato alliance, members fear Trump has arrived in London with other Nato leaders for a summit to mark the 70th anniversary of the transatlantic military alliance, of which he remains a noted skeptic.

Other Nato members reportedly fear his re-election in 2020 would cast serious doubt on the future of the organisation.

Prince Andrew accuser pleads for support from UK public Virginia Giuffre, the woman who claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions when she was 17, has asked for the support of the British public in her first UK television interview. Giuffre told the BBC she was instructed to have sex with Andrew by the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a close friend of Epstein\u2019s, who had introduced the late financier and sex offender to the prince. Royal retreat. Prince Andrew has stepped back from all public duties over the controversy around his friendship with Epstein, though he continues to categorically deny all the allegations against him. Offset fake news this Giving Tuesday \u2026 Amid a tsunami of disinformation and \u201calternative facts\u201d, the need for truth has never been greater.

Cheat sheet A new book about Melania Trump claims the first lady suspects her husband\u2019s adviser Roger Stone of having been behind the release of nude photos from her modelling past during the 2016 election, apparently to distract attention from a bad week in the campaign.

From podcasts to YouTube, from Fortnite to the Marvel Universe, other media appear to be mimicking the look, feel and structure of television, says Stuart Heritage. Is this rampant imitation robbing us of other, distinctive modes of storytelling? The virtuous thing to do this Christmas is boycott Amazon Some Amazon warehouse employees reportedly have to urinate in old water bottles because they can\u2019t take toilet breaks, while their boss Jeff Bezos enjoys the benefits of being the world\u2019s wealthiest man.
