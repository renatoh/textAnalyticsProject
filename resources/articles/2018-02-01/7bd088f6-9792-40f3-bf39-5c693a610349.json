The chief executive of Oxfam GB, Mark Goldring, and the head of Oxfam International, Winnie Byanyima, have also requested an \u201cofficial high-level meeting\u201d with the government. On Monday, two senior members of the charity\u2019s leadership, Simon Ticehurst and Margalida Massot, met Haiti\u2019s minister of planning and external cooperation to present the formal apology. The meeting was called by the minister to \u201cbegin clarifying the exact allegations and investigations\u201d into the \u201cabusive behaviours\u201d of some Oxfam staff after the devastating earthquake in 2010 which killed thousands of people. Ticehurst, who is the regional director for Latin America, said: \u201cOxfam is grateful to the Haitian government for allowing us the chance now to offer our humblest apologies and to begin explaining ourselves and start the long road ahead of re-establishing trust and partnership, given our 40-year history with Haiti and its citizens. \u201cWe stand ready to engage with the Haitian people and have expressed our openness to cooperate as much as required with the Haitian government.\u201d The apology was made as Oxfam finally released the findings of its investigation into the behaviour of relief workers sent to Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake, as part of efforts to draw a line under the crisis that has engulfed the charity for the past week. A copy of the 10-page report includes details of how the allegations came to light and of Oxfam\u2019s investigative process, which included interviews with about 40 witnesses \u2013 one of whom was physically threatened and intimidated by three of the suspects after details of the investigation were leaked. Responding to the report during a visit to a school in west London, Theresa May described the behaviour uncovered as \u201chorrific\u201d. The prime minister told journalists: \u201cThe behaviour that we\u2019ve now discovered was horrific. It was far below the standards that we expect for the charities and the NGOs that we\u2019re working with. And I understand there have been further revelations today which show that actually there was physical intimidation of witnesses. This is absolutely horrific. \u201cThis is exactly the problem that we see which means that all too often people don\u2019t feel able to come forward to report what has happened to them, the behaviour that they\u2019ve been on the receiving end of.\u201d The apology and release of the report follows a threat by Haiti over the weekend to revoke Oxfam\u2019s permission to work in the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
