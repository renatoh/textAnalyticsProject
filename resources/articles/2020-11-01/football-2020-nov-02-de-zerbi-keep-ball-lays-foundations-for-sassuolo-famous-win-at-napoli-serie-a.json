At an online event hosted by sports leaders from his hometown, Brescia, in May, the Sassuolo manager confessed to obsessing over opponents\u2019 strengths, adapting his team\u2019s preparations to a degree that he suspects might be counterproductive. This weekend\u2019s adversaries offered plenty of material to keep him up at night. Napoli had scored 14 goals in four Serie A games, winning all of them, with \u20ac70m new addition Victor Osimhen integrating seamlessly and Hirving Lozano starting to show his quality alongside the established combination of Lorenzo Insigne and Dries Mertens. Their only defeat thus far was a notional one \u2013 handed down after a no-show against Juventus. They were touted already as title contenders. For once, though, De Zerbi had a different concern. He knew all about Napoli\u2019s quality. What troubled him was the refusal of his players to accept their own. \u201cOver the past two days, when I told the team that we were just as strong, I looked in their faces and it seemed like they did not believe me,\u201d he told Sky Sports on Sunday. \u201cI stopped them and told them I\u2019m not a man who sells smoke. When I talk, it\u2019s because I\u2019m convinced about the words that I\u2019m saying. I was convinced of being able to beat Napoli.\u201d Sassuolo were without a loss themselves, though their schedule made that easier to dismiss. Two of their three wins had come against newly promoted Crotone and Spezia, and the third, over Bologna, required a chaotic three-goal comeback. De Zerbi\u2019s side had drawn at home to Cagliari and a dismal Torino. Their 16 goals were the most in the division, yet even here there was a caveat. Ciccio Caputo, Domenico Berardi and Filip Djuricic were responsible for 11 of those strikes. All three forwards had been ruled out for the Napoli game. Still, De Zerbi had a plan. If Sassuolo could starve Napoli of possession, there would be no way for their own constellation of attacking talent to do damage. It was an audacious thought, against a side who have been very effective at retaining the ball under Gennaro Gattuso, yet an obvious one at the same time. This is how De Zerbi has been modelling his side ever since he arrived in 2018. He has argued that a team with the ball has more power to set the agenda, but his outlook is also influenced by his own experiences as a former No 10 \u2013 who played out a modest but happy career mostly in Italian football\u2019s second, third and fourth tiers. \u201cWhen I didn\u2019t have the ball, I got nervous and I didn\u2019t enjoy myself,\u201d he has said. \u201cSo as a manager I always keep that thought in mind.\u201d Perhaps Napoli were feeling skittish already on Sunday. You could not credit a suffocating lack of possession for Osimhen\u2019s failure to score in the 11th minute, when Andrea Consigli passed the ball straight to him 10 yards out. The goalkeeper recovered impressively to block his shot, but a better finish would never have given him the chance. At that point, it must be said, De Zerbi\u2019s approach was starting to look dangerously misguided. Sassuolo had already thrown possession away once when trying to play out from the back, with Mertens flashing a resulting shot just wide from the edge of the box. Slowly, though, they improved. Better decisions were made passing out from defence, allowing the central midfield pairing of Maxime Lopez and Manuel Locatelli to get on the ball. Together they played keep-away, frustrating their hosts and minimising risks. By half-time, Sassuolo had enjoyed almost 60% of possession while barely creating a chance. A draw would have been a fine result. But Sassuolo also knew that opportunities would come with patience. The return of J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Boga to the starting lineup, after he missed the first month of this season with a coronavirus infection, meant they would always have a threat to break something open. As well as scoring 11 goals last season, he was Serie A\u2019s most prolific dribbler. It was his surge into the Napoli area early in the second-half that paved the way for Sassuolo to get their opening goal. Boga slipped between a pair of defenders before being tackled by Gaetano Di Lorenzo, but the full-back was unbalanced by the effort and his lunge to stop Giacomo Raspadori from seizing on the loose ball finished up with him planting studs on the striker\u2019s foot. The penalty was awarded after a VAR review. Locatelli converted. Napoli\u2019s response was frenetic. There were chances to draw level, but their play was disjointed throughout. When Kostas Manolas finally did get the ball in the net in injury time, his effort was disallowed for an offside call against Osimhen. The Nigerian then appeared to be fouled during the action that eventually led up to Sassuolo\u2019s second goal \u2013 scored by Lopez on the counter. None of which could take the wind out of De Zerbi\u2019s sails. \u201cYou never know if it will be easy to win or difficult,\u201d he said at full-time. \u201cWhat I tell the lads is that if we do lose, we can at least choose how to lose. If we lose, we will lose playing football.\u201d It is an approach that has won him plenty of admirers. Pep Guardiola was hailing De Zerbi\u2019s work as long ago as 2018, and plenty of observers have sought to draw a link between the two. In truth that would be oversimplifying, as the Italian cites a great number of managers among his inspirations. At another online seminar this spring, De Zerbi drew on work done by J\u00fcrgen Klopp at Liverpool and Maurizio Sarri at Empoli. The name he returns to most often, though, is that of Marcelo Bielsa. De Zerbi wrote to the Argentinian after landing his first Serie A position, at Palermo in 2016, and was shocked to receive a call back two days later. Bielsa invited him to spend a week observing training at Lille, and made time to sit down during that visit and get into the details. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know him,\u201d recalled De Zerbi. \u201cIf he\u2019s supposed to be crazy, then I would like to be the same way too.\u201d It won\u2019t take him long to earn such a reputation if he carries on like this. Sassuolo represent a town of little more than 40,000 people, and presently sit second in Serie A. On Sunday, De Zerbi took them to the Stadio San Paolo without his three top scorers, and beat Napoli at their own game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
