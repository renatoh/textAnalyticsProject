According to the Nationwide building society, prices rose by 1.2% in December from November while the annual growth rate jumped to 10.5% from 9.6%. The price of a typical house increased by \u00a345 a day during this year - three-and-a-half times faster than the \u00a312.50 a day in 2005 - bringing the average house price up to \u00a3173,746. Nationwide said annual growth returned to double digits for the first time since February and was way above the widespread expectation at this time last year that it would be in low single digits. It is forecasting that house prices will increase by 5% to 8% next year. Nationwide economist Fionnuala Earley said the warm weather has played only a minor role, \"but the housing market clearly warmed up during the year.\" She added: \"There are still few signs that the rate of house price growth will moderate in the very short term. Evidence from estate agents continues to show that supply conditions are tight with few sellers coming to market.\" The stock-to-sales ratio - a good lead indicator of house prices - has continued to increase, suggesting a few more months of firm price growth. However, Nationwide expects worsening affordability and recent interest rate hikes to affect activity in the housing market in coming months, which will feed into a slower rate of house price growth in the second half of the year. Ms Earley said: \"Until now the strengthening housing market has not been a big feature of Monetary Policy Committee discussions on interest rates, but the latest set of minutes clearly identify this as an upside risk. \"Whether the breaching of the double digit threshold will increase the MPC's concern depends on whether or not it believes that there is a greater risk that higher house prices will feed into consumer spending and fuel inflation.\" \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
