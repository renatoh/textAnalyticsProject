They are testimony to bygone life in action. New research today in a journal gnomically known as Proceedings of the Royal Society B reveals that dinosaurs were alive and scuttling about the planet millions of years before the first evidence from fossilised bones. Sets of footprints beautifully preserved in the mountains of Poland confirm that pioneers of the lineage were already afoot in the Triassic around 250 million years ago, soon after the calamitous Permian extinction that wiped out 90% of life on Earth. Fossil footprints freakishly preserved in ancient mud provide concrete evidence of the size, gait and identity of their makers. These tracks, the largest no more than 40mm, were made by little creatures now called dinosauromorphs, ancestors of the birds. A set of ancient hominid footprints preserved 3.6 million years ago in volcanic ash in Laetoli, Tanzania, are so clear that palaeontologists have been able to argue that they might have been made by a couple, perhaps holding hands. The world changed for Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe when a naked human footprint in the sand showed that he had company on his desert island. Every footprint tells a moving story, and the Polish discovery reveals that the ancestors of all birds were small, light and four-footed. Like some Hollywood disclaimer, the footprints also assure us of another comforting thing: no dinosauromorphs were injured in the making of this picture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
