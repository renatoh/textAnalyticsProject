Pep Guardiola told Sky Sports after Manchester City\u2019s 3-1 win at Everton that racism needed to be fought every day but that the media had treated Silva unfairly. Sterling said: \u201cBernardo made a joke to his friend. He\u2019s not referred to his skin colour , he\u2019s not referred to his lips. They\u2019ve both got small heads \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s really sad to see someone like Bernardo, the whole week be kind of down about it, because he\u2019s not that way inclined \u2026 They\u2019re two really good friends, it\u2019s really sad to see. \u201cI can understand where the criticism has come but I don\u2019t think it was no way intentional [sic] or trying to be racist. It\u2019s not because it\u2019s my teammates, it\u2019s the way I view it. I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s any racism in it but I can exactly see the point where people have come from. \u201cBernardo\u2019s deeply sorry about it. We\u2019ve got to be smart on social media because we understand in this day in age now anything you say or anything you do can quickly be judged and it\u2019s just a really sad situation.\u201d He also expressed support for City\u2019s handling of what happened and the hope that the FA would understand that there was no reference to skin colour. Anichebe, who was a pundit for Sky at the match, said that jokes were made in dressing rooms and that he didn\u2019t think Silva was a racist but added: \u201cHe knows better \u2026 he\u2019s followed by so many people. When you post something like this it opens up and invites other people to also joke about these things \u2026 that can spiral. Bernardo Silva will know he\u2019s in the wrong now \u2026 I don\u2019t think that he should do this and the way City have handled it I think it\u2019s a joke \u2026 kind of saying that the media should focus on other things. No, you should correct your player not to put these things out into social media.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
