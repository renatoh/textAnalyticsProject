Either the prime minister was so impressed that he decided to reward Boyle's vision, or so appalled that it seemed the only way to avoid a national embarrassment was to throw money at the problem. The need to bung another \u00a340m into whatever all-singing, all-dancing spectacular the director of Trainspotting and Slumdog Millionaire has in mind demonstrated how fundamentally the organisers have misjudged so much about these Games. While it is true that in 2005, when they won the vote, the world economy looked very different, the global crash of 2008 gave them ample time to reconsider their aims and objectives. At that point they might have invested in a few copies of Janie Hampton's marvellous book The Austerity Olympics, then newly published, and absorbed some obvious lessons from the author's research into the London Games of 1948. For a start, Hampton's findings might have persuaded them that it was not necessary to attempt to match the opening ceremonies of past Olympics. With Beijing's eye-popping effort still fresh in the mind, they could have answered the awful question \u2013 \"How can we top that?\" \u2013 with a simple declaration that they weren't even going to try. The Chinese government's exploitation of all its technical and human resources was driven by a desire to show the world what it was capable of, and could never be matched, even by a country not mired in a financial crisis. The 1948 opening ceremony was a modest affair. Hampton records how an ailing King George VI, a prime minister \u2013 Clem Attlee \u2013 preoccupied with the Berlin Airlift and the Archbishop of York were the principal dignitaries among the 80,000 crowd at Wembley. In a temperature of 93F (34C), the hottest in London since 1911, the members of the International Olympic Committee wore top hats and tails while waiting for the 3,714 male athletes and 385 females to parade before them. Spectators unable to afford food from the stadium cafes, which required rationing coupons, filled the time before the 3pm start by munching their packed lunches. Britain's representatives brought up the rear, having waited four hours in the open outside the stadium, and once all the athletes were inside Sir Malcolm Sargent conducted the band of the Brigade of Guards, Wembley Philharmonic Orchestra and the massed choirs of the BBC, the National Provincial Bank and the City of Westminster in the Hallelujah Chorus. The heat threw the instruments out of tune and the experience was, Sargent said, \"like taking a jellyfish for a walk on an elastic lead\". The flame was carried into the stadium by John Mark, a 22-year-old medical student whose blond good looks were later said by some observers to be too close for comfort to the Aryan ideal of 1936. From baskets arranged around the track, 7,000 homing pigeons set off on a contest of their own with the encouragement of a salute from the 21 guns of the Royal Artillery, arrayed outside the main entrance. The Olympic flag, which had been discovered in a Berlin safe in 1945, was unfurled. And that was about it. We could manage with even less now. The decision should have been made to abandon a conventional stadium ceremony altogether and opt for something the British know how to do: a parade up The Mall to the gates of Buckingham Palace, where today's dignitaries could have taken the athletes' salute from the balcony. Given their experience with royal weddings and US presidential visits, the police would have coped with the crowds, while the great paymasters of the television networks would have loved the setting amid London's finest landmarks \u2013 the Houses of Parliament, the Eye, Nelson's Column \u2013 and the mass of humanity swirling up the tree-lined, flag-bedecked boulevard. And Danny Boyle could have staged an after-party in Hyde Park. It's so obvious, really. If I can think of it, why couldn't they? Let's put the Sir in Surtees Grand prix racing has its fair share of knights of the realm \u2013 Sir Stirling Moss, Sir Jackie Stewart, Sir Frank Williams, Australia's Sir Jack Brabham \u2013 but no one has ever come up with a satisfactory explanation for the continued refusal of the Queen to unsheath her sword and tap John Surtees on the shoulder. For those who don't know, Surtees is the only man ever to win the world championships on both two and four wheels, the latter achievement coming in 1964. Anti-biking snobbism may be the problem. Or perhaps a sniffily disapproving memory of how, when he ran his own Formula One team, they were briefly sponsored by Durex. In an attempt to correct this long-standing injustice, somebody has had the bright idea of starting one of those petitions that occasionally get the people in charge to do the bleedin' obvious. This one is at www.petitionbuzz.com/petitions/sirjohnsurtees, and there is a long way to go until it reaches the critical mass of 10,000 signatures. The great man is 77, and it would be nice for him to have a few years to enjoy a deserved accolade. Join in now. Stop the rush to hush That was some victory for Harlequins over the French giants Toulouse in France on Sunday, including several controversial incidents and a prop who played to the finish of the Heineken Cup tie with a smashed cheekbone. What a pity, then, that one of the English side's players saw fit to celebrate the first of two fine tries by the full-back Mike Brown with that horrible forefinger-to-lips shushing gesture beloved of professional footballers. For rugby's sake, let's nip that one in the bud right now. Cutting Keane During the course of an entertainingly self-justifying interview in the Sunday Times, Roy Keane claimed that Brian Clough deserved his respect and gratitude more than Sir Alex Ferguson. In that case, why didn't he stay at the City Ground in 1993 and help Nottingham Forest win their third European Cup, rather than Manchester United their second? But the dismissal of Ferguson's mind games was as merciless as one of Keane's tackles: \"It helps when you've got good players winning you matches.\" richard.williams@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
