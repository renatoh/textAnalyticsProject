Bill Clinton has declared he will not be taking charge of a chat show microphone in the near future. The former US president has put a dampener on months of speculation that he is to front a talk show on American TV, but has not ruled out the new career path entirely. Speaking on the king of the US chat shows, Larry King Live, Mr Clinton said he was not set to become King's rival in the near future. Mr King asked Mr Clinton if he was going to become a talk show host, to which he replied: \"I don't think so. You know, maybe sometime later in my life I'd like to do it. \"It would be intriguing to me because I like to talk to people,\" he added. The comments appear to spell out that negotiations between cigar-loving Mr Clinton and two US TV networks, NBC and CBS, to produce his own chat show have ended. But the situation may only be temporary, as Mr Clinton's remarks suggest a career in TV is still a route he would like to explore. The former president's lawyer in Washington, Robert Barnett, told the New York Times that Mr Clinton was not closed to new ideas. \"He has had some wonderful opportunities offered to him. And at the right time, in the right format, I am sure he would explore them,\" said Mr Barnett. The issue of the right format may be central to Mr Clinton's future plans. The saxophone playing politician is thought to favour a light current affairs style show with musical interludes whereas CBS would prefer more celebrity interviews. CBS is desperate to find a new host to replace Oprah Winfrey who is due to retire in 2006. NBC was the first network to open discussions with Mr Clinton for a daily show but were reported to have collapsed over his demands for a guaranteed salary of $100m over two years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
