He has defended the post on the grounds that British universities had \"to find funding where [they] can\". Dr George Joffe, a member of the politics department at Cambridge, was appointed adviser to the LSE's North Africa research programme with the role of scrutinising proposals for academic merit. The dictator's son Saif's charitable foundation donated \u00a31.5m to the programme . Joffe, who is also director of the Royal United Services Institute's Qatar programme, described the Gaddafi regime as \"in many respects deplorable\". However, he said: \"The LSE like most British universities has to find funding where it can. Funding from Middle East states is likely to be provided by oil-rich states. I didn't participate in that decision, I'm not responsible for it. \"I'm paid by the university, not paid by Libya. Don't forget the money came from the Gaddafi charitable foundation, not from the Libyan state - that does make a difference.\" The aim of the LSE's research programme, now suspended, was to place Libya \"within the wider context of the region\". It also aimed to narrow its focus over time to look at \"the specific issues and challenges facing Libya\". Joffe added: \"Saif was a student at the school. If as a student he wants to make a donation to his alma mater it's an understandable thing to do.\" In an article published in the online journal Arab Reform Bulletin last year, Joffe wrote positively about Saif as a potential reformer: \"It is true that the colonel [Gaddafi] has, in recent months, made it clear that he believes that he has an international mission to fulfil and for which he must disembarrass himself from the day-to-day problems of domestic Libyan politics. \"If he really means this and does give Saif al-Islam his head, then the implications for domestic reform in Libya could be profound indeed.\" Joffe's appointment is confirmed in leaked internal documents which also show that Prof David Held, an academic adviser to Saif Gaddafi during his four years at LSE, visited Libya in December 2009 on behalf of the programme. Alia Brahimi, another LSE academic, met Saif Gaddafi in Greece last July to discuss \"objectives and expectations\". Brahimi also visited Libya that month. The university has received a total of \u00a3300,000 via the foundation, and will discuss a proposal to use the money for a scholarship fund for Libyan students. The head of the LSE admitted that he felt embarrassed about the university's ties with the Gaddafi family. Sir Howard Davies, director of the LSE, told the BBC: \"We thought that since he was not going to control the research that this was a reasonable thing to do and this was supported widely in the school. \"It was debated at some length. We took a risk on that and I think it's right to say that that risk backfired on us. I feel embarrassed about it but I don't think the decision was made without due consideration at the time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
