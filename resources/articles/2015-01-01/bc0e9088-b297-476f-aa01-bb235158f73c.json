The bad news is, once the maths had been worked through on a ludicrously tight mid-table, they dropped a place to eighth. Still, only two points separate them from Wasps in fourth, so they will secure the top-six status they so ardently want if they manage a few more results like this. They are a gathering force. The move to Saturday rugby is proving popular, even if the traffic situation on the approach to their smart new home remains desperate enough to keep making reports it has no business appearing in. Sale are building towards five-figure crowds but the atmosphere, which can be so sterile in new stadiums, already has an old-school feel about it. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got problems with the infrastructure round here,\u201d said Steve Diamond, Sale\u2019s director of rugby, \u201cbut at least they\u2019re turning up now, unlike last year. If they keep turning up, we may spend some more money on the team.\u201d On the field this Sale performance was after the fashion of the boss, hard-edged and to the point. Off it the Diamond tour de force continued, continually managing expectations while applying the blow torch to injustice. This time the referee got it in the neck for merely resetting the scrum Sale drove back to the Northampton line in the first half. Then Diamond repeated calls for Danny Cipriani to be given a chance with England, drawing comparison with the fly-half\u2019s opposite number, Stephen Myler, who is ahead in England\u2019s pecking order. \u201cMyler and Danny are top players, but it\u2019s unfair on Danny if selection for England is affected by the performance of his team, because Northampton have a better team than us generally. Today we got the rub of the green up front, because of their lack of personnel, and Danny played well. But he\u2019s played well all year. On his performances over the last three months, he deserves a shot.\u201d Certainly, heoutshone Myler on this occasion, albeit from a very comfortable armchair. He didn\u2019t miss a shot at goal, despite a vicious wind, nor did he misplace a kick for position, and his looping runs and deft flicks sent many a runner into space. Diamond\u2019s opposite number and erstwhile Sale team-mate, Jim Mallinder, was phlegmatic about this first defeat for the champions in eight matches, citing the absence of four lock forwards. \u201cOne of rugby\u2019s strengths is you need men in specialist positions,\u201d he said, \u201cand one of those is tall, heavy men in the second row. Unfortunately we ran out of them today. It happens. Most teams would struggle if they lost four of their best second-rows. Not many squads can call on more than that.\u201d They felt the absence keenly, well beaten at the set piece, conceding two line-out-and-drive tries and a 20-0 deficit before they managed to fire a shot themselves in the final quarter. All four locks, though, including Courtney Lawes, should be available for the trip to the Ospreys, when Europe resumes next week, as will Dylan Hartley, whose suspension expires this week. There was a sense the Ospreys match was more on Northampton\u2019s mind than this, while Sale, whose hopes in Europe are over, poured everything into the here and now. \u201cTop four is not out of the question for us,\u201d Diamond said, \u201cbut we\u2019d have to play like that every week. Whether we\u2019re capable of it is another matter.\u201d And with one more reference to his club as minnows he was off, leaving us simultaneously excited about Sale\u2019s future and in no doubt of what an achievement against the odds any success would represent. A tour de force, indeed.
