After months of reading prospectuses, making decisions, filling in Ucas forms, sitting exams and enjoying a gap year, you've finally reached your goal. You're at university. Your parents are just a pair of retreating tail-lights in a cloud of dust and you're about to start your college career armed with nothing more than a mysteriously unthumbed reading list and a catering-sized jar of instant coffee. It's time to do freshers' week. Freshers' week is a strange thing. It bears about as much relation to university life as you will know it for the next three or four years, as Christmas does to the other 364 days of the year. But for all that it is strange, shambolic and - thankfully - short, it can go a long way towards shaping the rest of your university life. While to most people freshers' week is all about parties, pulling and pints (not only for the newbies - all other years take freshers' week as a chance to relive their first heady days at university, only without the constraints of having no friends and being constantly terrified of making a hideous social faux pas), there are lots of less interesting things to consider as well. The first few days will probably be a merry-go-round of introductory meetings, registrations, tours and all manner of other administrative hoo-ha. Although it might seem hideously tedious (and it seems that way because quite often it is), it pays to go along to everything. Write things in your diary and make sure you turn up on time, and in the right place, otherwise half-way through term you may well find yourself the only student in your hall who doesn't have an email account, isn't registered with a GP and doesn't have a clue how the library works. People are much less indulgent to new students after freshers' week. It's also a chance to familiarise yourself with the movers and shakers - academic types, student union bods and college staff - and the geography of your new surroundings. Whether you're on a campus, or your college's buildings are scattered far and wide, you'll need to get lost a fair few times before you find your bearings. Go for a wander and try to get lost now, rather than when you're running 10 minutes late for your first tutorial. And locate your local amenities: the nearest computer room, supermarket, cashpoint and bar. There will doubtless also be drinks parties and more informal, student-run \"getting to know you\" meetings. Attend as though your life depends on it. You may make new friends and, at the very least, you'll get a free glass of wine (the last free drink you'll ever get from a fellow student). The \"highlight\" of the week is freshers' fair: an event in which the university's student-run organisations attempt to cajole, persuade or downright bully you into joining up. Do not miss it. Every extra-curricular activity, from orchestra to origami, from yoga to yachting, will be represented. There are stalls, and home-made banners. There may well be badges, and frightfully enthusiastic peo ple telling you how simply marvellous student water polo is. All you have to do is wander around, see what you fancy and sign up. People split decidedly into two factions at freshers' fair: those who sign up for everything and then wonder for the next three years why the archery team won't stop pestering them, and those who don't sign up for anything because they aren't sure and think they can always join up later on. Do it now. Signing your name to something is rarely a firm commitment - usually it just means you'll be invited to attend a further meeting or an introductory session - whereas if you don't sign up now you'll probably find your glimmer of interest is snuffed out by your academic work and hectic social life. The range and quality of personal pursuits is one of the major perks of your time at college: you'd be foolish to pass it up. And don't be shy or intimidated by the idea of putting yourself forward as a potential star of the drama group or the student paper. Speaking as one who has manned a freshers' fair stall or two, I can confirm that everyone is simply crying out for fresh blood and new talent and will welcome you with open arms (and more than a little sympathy, for it was not so long ago they were signing up themselves). For everyone - absolutely everyone - the most terrifying prospect of freshers' week is the idea of not knowing anyone. It's enough to make a sensible person want to stay in their room and hide. And if you do do that, don't worry too much: freshers' week is not your only opportunity to make friends, you've got three whole years to get to know people. Nor are the first few friends necessarily yours for life: good news if you unwittingly fall in with the Celine Dion fan club. Still, it is nice to arm yourself with a chum or two in the first few days, so you don't feel you're doing university all on your own. And freshers' week, with its endless social whirl and toxic cocktails, is an opportunity to move it and shake it with as wide a variety of people as possible, before everyone settles down to a more steady routine. Don't think for a moment that you won't make friends. You will. Probably very good friends, and probably very quickly. I am still best mates with the first girl I smiled at at college. Hell, I know people who married the first person they smiled at at college. No one is sitting there waiting to shun your every attempt at friendship. They are sitting there panicking that no one will ever talk to them. So just greet everyone you see with a big smile and a \"How are you getting on?\" - they'll be so thrilled that someone has been nice to them that they'll be devoted to you forever. And then your problems really begin. The delight of freshers week for the men - and, in these enlightened times, the women - in the years above the freshers has always been \"sharking\" (that is, the aggressive pursuit of attractive, vulnerable and drunken first years for the purpose of sexual gratification). Far be it for us to tell you how to live your life: if you wish to bed the entire hockey squad and then move onto the darts team, feel free (as long as you are being careful and availing yourself of the many, many free condoms that the welfare reps will be forcing on you during freshers' week). Do be aware, however, that first impressions do last. You might think that extreme behaviour will gain you attention and acceptance, but unless it's the way you wish to be remembered for the rest of your college career, you might do well to avoid out-of-character abandon. Freshers' week isn't really about work, but the rest of your time at university is, so it pays to spend a little time thinking about it. Make sure you at least know where the library is, and have seen your tutors and picked up your timetable and assignments. Some people will have read the whole of the set texts for the course; others won't have done anything. Don't despair too much either way: you have plenty of time to assess what catching up needs to be done, and to do it. Don't fret that you won't be up to the rigours of a university course: if you got in, you're good enough. Of course, now is also the time to talk to your tutors if you have any early concerns about the course you're doing or your ability to cope. While \"fun\" isn't exactly the best word to describe freshers' week (not at the time, anyway: when you're doing your finals, it will be remembered as the best fun ever) - it's a whirl, it's exhausting, it's exhilarating and it's essential. And one thing's for sure, once it's all over, you won't feel like a shiny new student any more: you'll be a knackered, hung-over, grubby student instead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
