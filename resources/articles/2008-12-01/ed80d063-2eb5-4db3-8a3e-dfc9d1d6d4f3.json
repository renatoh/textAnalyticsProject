Indeed, President-elect Obama recently confirmed that he intends to \"reboot\" relations Muslim majority countries. Some ways of doing this outreach include using his middle name \u2013 Hussein \u2013 during the swearing in ceremony and by making a speech in an Islamic capital in his first 100 days. Repairing America's tarnished reputation in the Muslim world has consistently been part of Obama's narrative. In January he spoke about holding a summit with Muslim leaders. In February, at a California press conference, he stated that due to his family relations, his life experiences and his opposition to the war in Iraq, he would be given significant credibility in the Muslim world. Obama has also promised to close the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and set a schedule for proper trials \u2013 a gesture that, if followed through, would be well-regarded in Muslim majority countries. There is some evidence to suggest that Obama is striking the right chords: everyone from elites meeting at international Islamic conferences in Qatar to Muslims of African origin who have been historically repressed, have found something positive in Obama's election. There has also been some evidence that his election helps Muslim reformers because they are no longer afraid of being labelled pro-American. In fact, Obama has indirectly helped score one public relations victory vis a vis al-Qaida already: after Ayman al-Zawahiri used a racial slur against Obama, Muslim organisations in the US rapidly and firmly hurled condemnations against the terrorist outfit. The alacrity of the response suggests that Obama inspires something that Bush didn't. However, it is also the case that the challenges in the Muslim world are so grave and deep-seated that Obama's engagement cannot be merely cosmetic. Obama's \"re-boot\" must be full-throttled and full-throated and it should try to bring to light \u2013 even if it can't solve \u2013 the multitude of systemic and institutional problems. The primary issue has to do with illegitimate rulers. In his zeal to repair the broken bridges with Muslim countries Obama cannot allow himself to give legitimacy to such regimes. A New York Times columnist recently clamored for Obama to give an inspirational speech in Egypt. Obama must fight the temptation of giving in to such ill-conceived ideas. Egypt is currently ruled by one of the most corrupt and stifling governments in the Muslim world. If Obama speaks in Cairo, it may make for a great image, but he would also become the agent of a dictator \u2013 a dictator that scrubbed political cartoons about Obama style \"change\". Obama's goal has to be to constructively undermine the Mubaraks of the world, not reach out a hand of support to them. If the president-elect must do anything with respect to Egypt it is to remind the world about Ayman Noor, the dissident political prisoner \u2013 called by an expert \"as close to a pro-western liberal as you'll find in the Middle East\" \u2013 who was abandoned by President Bush. Obama must engage in a bit of creative destruction and withhold support from all Muslim dictators \u2013 even at the risk of straining relations \u2013 until they are willing to provide fundamental liberties to their citizens and become amenable to releasing their political prisoners. Another area where Obama must provide leadership is with respect to the Islamic right. I am referring to the vast network of populist religious parties operating in every Muslim majority country. In many countries such parties compose the only viable democratic alternative, yet, at the same time, these parties have often demonstrated very little regard for fundamental liberties themselves. Many have allowed their fringes to link up with militant and extremist groups. They have further intimidated their opponents, stifled dissent and blatantly turned Islam into a tool for demonising religious and ethnic minorities. Certainly it is true that Islamist parties evolve, but before giving them validation and support Barack Obama must demand all parties on the Islamic right affirm certain benchmarks. Obama must urgently provide a way of distinguishing between liberty-oriented Islamists and liberty-stifling ones. The case of Iran will probably be dispositive. In the Islamic Republic \u2013 which is really a theocratic oligarchy \u2013 Obama will be dealing with the most sophisticated and best entrenched Islamist operation in the Muslim world. Iranian leaders might think it's pretty cool that Obama shares a name with a major figure in Shia Islam but a name isn't going to translate into liberties for Iranian citizens. How Obama manages to, at once, inspire the machinery to relent control, while bringing it into the the global mainstream, is going to be a tremendous challenge, but one that he must throw himself into fully. A third area has to do with how Obama deals with the \"weak\" Muslim states \u2013 countries that have either failed, fragmented or where the federal government simply isn't able to provide for its citizens. Here Pakistan and Somalia come to mind. It should be no surprise that the two Muslim majority states today that are most closely associated with terrorism and piracy respectively constantly rank at the bottom of most international indices. Simply inundating friendly leaders in these countries with cash will not do \u2013 and with the recession is probably not possible. Rather, institutional solutions involving aid agencies, banks, foreign investors and public works projects will have to be crafted. Admittedly, much of what Obama must do as part of his re-boot sounds quite boring and cannot be spoken about in flights of rhetorical bluster, but it is only that sort of menial and laborious work, reprogramming if you will, that will turn America into a force for good and resurrect the good name that President Bush spent years besmirching. One advantage the president-elect has is that no previous American leader has had as much good will among Muslims as Obama does now. He should wield this power to try and negotiate new and original policies. They might then become the operating system for future American leaders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
