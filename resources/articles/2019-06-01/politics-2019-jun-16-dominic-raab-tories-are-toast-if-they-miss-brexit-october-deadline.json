As the five remaining rivals to Boris Johnson prepare for a televised debate on Sunday evening, Hunt warned it would be wrong to commit now to leave the EU by Halloween, come what may. He told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI want to make an argument that what Boris is offering \u2013 a hard stop at any cost, on 31 October \u2013 means that he is effectively committing the country to no deal \u2026 or an election, if parliament chooses to stop that. And my argument is, are those really the best that we as Conservatives can offer the country?\u201d Hunt\u2019s comments contrasted with a fresh warning from his fellow leadership contender Dominic Raab on Sunday that the Tory party would be \u201ctoast\u201d if it failed to take Britain out of the EU by the end of October. Hunt said he wanted to negotiate a new package with the EU27. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible to do this by 31 October, but it will be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not committing to a 31 October hard stop at any cost, because I don\u2019t think you can make that guarantee.\u201d Hunt said recent discussions with EU leaders, in his post as foreign secretary, had convinced him there could be a negotiated way through the Brexit impasse. \u201cApproached by a British PM, someone they were willing to deal with, who had ideas to solve the Irish border, they would be willing to renegotiate the package,\u201d he said. \u201cIn particular, they\u2019re prepared to consider whether you could get much more detail over the future relationship, so that you wouldn\u2019t need the backstop.\u201d Earlier, Raab had highlighted the risks of \u201ccorrosion of public trust\u201d for his party, with the Brexit party leading in several polls. \u201cThe Tory party will be toast unless we\u2019re out by the end of October. People need to wake up to this. We\u2019ve seen from the Peterborough byelection, we\u2019ve seen it from the European elections,\u201d he said, referring to \u201cthe frustration, the scandal people feel\u201d over the delays to Brexit. \u201cThe Conservatives cannot win an election unless we\u2019ve delivered Brexit,\u201d he added, speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News. Raab also again declined to rule out proroguing parliament, if as prime minister he believed a no-deal Brexit was the right course and MPs sought to block it. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something we would want to do,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think it\u2019s very unlikely. But what\u2019s really scandalous about this, is where people have been trying to sabotage the will of the people, and break their promises left, right and centre.\u201d Brexit has dominated the early stages of the leadership debate. Michael Gove, who came third in the first MPs\u2019 ballot on Tuesday, has suggested he would be willing to delay by a few weeks or months if necessary to get the right deal, but Johnson, who is the overwhelming frontrunner, has insisted he will leave on time. Rory Stewart, Johnson\u2019s fellow old Etonian, who picked up the support of the defence minister Tobias Ellwood on Sunday, told the BBC he did not know what Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan really was. \u201cThis is the moment, in this leadership race, to say who \u2013 and it\u2019s a very brutal question \u2013 who do you trust to be your prime minister? How is Boris going to deliver Brexit? How?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t even know what he believes \u2013 he won\u2019t talk to me, he won\u2019t talk to you, he won\u2019t talk to the public,\u201d he said, before reiterating his insistence that he would not take a cabinet job if Johnson were to offer him one. \u201cI would not serve,\u201d he said. Johnson is not taking part in Sunday\u2019s TV debate, after warning he feared it could be \u201ccacophonous\u201d \u2013 but will join a similar event on Tuesday night, after at least one more leadership contender has been knocked out. Stewart said his approach would be to try to get the existing Brexit deal through parliament, telling MPs: \u201cThis is the last-chance saloon. Get it done.\u201d If that failed, he would convene a citizens\u2019 assembly to decide what should happen next. \u201cAll these other people are just saying: I\u2019m just going to go to Europe, and I\u2019m going to shout, and I\u2019m going to get us out, \u2018Give me a deal,\u2019\u201d he said. Sajid Javid used an article in BrexitCentral on Sunday to set out more details of his approach. He said he would aim to deliver \u201cthe only thing that\u2019s got through parliament: leaving Europe with alternative arrangements on the backstop\u201d. And he repeated his offer to subsidise any spending by the Irish government necessary to provide border checks. Johnson has also talked about alternative arrangements, but Raab said: \u201cI\u2019m not quite clear what Boris\u2019s plan is.\u201d Raab has pitched himself as the most determined Brexiter, but many of the most ardent Tory leavers, including Steve Baker and Jacob Rees-Mogg, are backing Johnson instead. Raab sought to burnish his reputation as the most resolute leaver on Sunday, saying: \u201cAll those candidates that are going weak at the knees, and saying, \u2018I\u2019m not sure about this or that,\u2019 they\u2019re sending a message to the EU that, frankly, they can take us for a ride. We\u2019ve had three years of that, and, frankly, it\u2019s time to get this done.\u201d And while he came fourth in the first round of voting, with 27 supporters, he insisted he still hoped to achieve the 33 votes necessary to progress to the next round, when MPs take part in the second round on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had extra support coming in, so I\u2019ve got a good base, and we\u2019re well-placed to build some momentum. The race hasn\u2019t really started,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
