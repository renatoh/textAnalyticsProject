There\u2019s no way Amanda Holden can follow the Dyer WDYTYA so skip that, make a strong drink and meet me here just before 9pm. Byeeeeeee. Lord! Al is already advertising for contestants for NEXT year. Every year I kind of assume that\u2019s it. It must be over now. The experiment to find the occupants of the next Golgafrincham B Arc. But no, on it goes. \u201cI\u2019m just looking forward to seeing my mum,\u201d says Paul in the back of the terminal taxi. Spoken like Danny Dyer after he\u2019s just found out he\u2019s NOT related to Henry III after all. Bye Paul, you big unreconstructed misogynist what Al could not afford to be associated with and who probably had a balls business plan anyways. And so to Al\u2019s decision. He says that Paul is not a potential winner and firs his arse right out of the door. He\u2019s STILL telling both \u201cladies\u201d to calm themselves down because they live to fight another week. Paul is fired, Jess and Fran continue. Al accuses Paul of aggression like he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s a good thing. If Paul wasn\u2019t aggressive, he\u2019d tell him he was a pussy. No wonder these candidates go mad. There is literally no way for them to win. Jessica is finding this really hard to to listen to and tries to turn away from the table because she knows crying is not acceptable in a boardroom situation. Oh women, with your feelings and your hormones. Paul was always the one I thought of as like Lord Sugar and that he\u2019d see as a kindred spirit. But I\u2019ve gone right off him now. Both women get passionate in their own defence and both of them are told to \u201ccalm down\u201d by Alan. Sitting on my hands here. Could this be Jessica\u2019s last stand. I find myself suddenly sad to see her on the cusp of going. I hope the women realise it\u2019s time to turn on Paul because it\u2019s their own means of survival and he\u2019d do the same to them. Naturally, Paul is coming back with Jessica and... Fran. Wow. That\u2019s got to hurt when she thought she\u2019d gained safety by becoming his wing person. I hope Fran actually tries to kill him. This is unexpected. Paul is now getting heat for demoting Jessica. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve noticed that he doesn\u2019t really like women and they\u2019re not OK with that. Fair play. Paul\u2019s team learns that the shitty canap\u00e9s they served actually cost them a pile of cash in refunds. Everyone sucks lemons as Fran tries to give Jess some props for trying to save the situation. Paul and team have drained their polystyrene cups and returned to the boardroom. Sofiane makes the fair point that his sales went down the toilet the minute his punters heard the tickets were going cheaper elsewhere. Trishna adds weight to the argument that Jess was to blame. Paul agrees with her and the knives are fully out for Jess. She might as well be smeared in blood and be tethered to a hook dangling over a shark tank. Trishna brings up Jess\u2019s hot food thing. She has sensed blood and sees Jess\u2019s feet stumbling into the quicksand. There\u2019s no way she\u2019s going to support her fellow sister now, not wishing to be dragged down with her. Their treat is to go to Warwick Castle. Full disclosure - I used to work at Warwick Castle in my teens as a wench. That was my job title. It\u2019s as close as I\u2019ve ever come to being an Apprentice candidate. Back at the sad cafe, Paul revs up his engines and Jessica starts to cry. Sofiane and Fran sound level-headed and measured. But Paul and Jess go at it and he is a big, stubbly bully. I knew he\u2019d do this. Nebula - profit of 1127.64 Titans - profit \u00a32400.66 Titans somehow achieved 100% customer satisfaction. Titans win. Alan tries to grasp the numbers involved and why the price of them, on Paul\u2019s team, fluctuated so wildly. Jessica is blamed roundly and soundly and she fights back, while also fighting back tears. There is no way some baldy boy is going to reduce her to flapping sobs. I like her more and more. Karrren also smacks down Courtney for his floppy performance as a not-bothered pirate. Over on Paul\u2019s end of the boardroom table, the hands are clasped and apologetic. Jess uses the word \u201cinterject\u201d to appear less Timmy Mallet and more John Malkovic. I think she pulled it off, if only for a moment. Karrren majorly slags Dillon for singing in a way that suggest pure jealousy. I bet she practices in front of the mirror every night, her finger hovering over that PUBLISH button on YouTube. OH I almost missed Alan\u2019s under-sea zinger about OYSTER CARDS. How I wish I had. One day I plan to find out who writes those and personally take them to task. Dillon tries to justify flogging \u00a355 tickets for a karaoke mermaid. It is the next day. The costumes have gone, the bleak suits are back and we are off to the boardroom. Titans - explain your under-sea debacle, Alan\u2019s eyes seem to say. So they do. Paul starts dishing out free burgers but the awkwardness leaves a sour taste. By 10pm, some tired looking mermaids are rounding off the show with another chorus from The Little Mermaid. Do they know any other songs? Dillon\u2019s sub-team try desperately to sell the hot food at the aquarium when they have already stuffed punters with free canap\u00e9s. Meanwhile, Paul is getting grief because half-starved punters were expecting hot food (thanks to Jess\u2019s sales pitch) and there isn\u2019t any free stuff. \u201cI\u2019m going to be singing,\u201d trills Dillon back at the under-sea ship-wreck. He\u2019s actually not bad. Karrrren says it\u2019s disorganised and shambolic but everyone seems to be just drunk enough to enjoy it. He\u2019s pulling this off. Trishna gives an informative talk about Madame Tussaud\u2019s which impresses Claude a lot. \u201cThat woman has got a photographic memory,\u201d he gasps as he clearly prepares to offer her a job the minute the cameras stop rolling. Courtney, on the other hand, is so laid back at the aquarium he might as well have been smoking something. He knows nothing and it shows. The canap\u00e9s do the rounds but no one eats them, according to Claude. Once inside the aquarium, punters are again asked to pay to have a special tour of the premises. Grainne realises they have over-sold the tour by twice. Turns out if you get people pissed on \u201cfree\u201d wine you can get them to buy anything. My eBay history could have told you that. Claude sarcastically clinks glasses with Sean Connery as both events begin. At the aquarium, the cheap cava is waiting and Dillon is fully dressed in an ill-fitting white captain\u2019s suit that he has clearly saved from last week\u2019s boat show. Both teams are told some facts about their tourist attraction. Trishna talks over the Tussaud\u2019s woman who politely says, \u201cYou\u2019re an expert already,\u201d when she really means, shut up, I\u2019m talking. Dillon and Alanna are now madly over-catering for their guests. Claude is bitching about the quality of their snacks like a man who has been to too many of those kinds of parties. Show some gratitude, baldie. Some people only dream of tomato on tiny toast. \u201cGet drunk with the fishes,\u201d says Courtney, trying to drum up business outside the aquarium. Why does that sound like something De Niro would say in a film just before he shoved you into the Hudson in concrete boots? Dillon talks up the non-aquatic mermaid and is personally affronted that the others aren\u2019t impressed by as singing woman in a fishtail dress. Jess is annoyed that Paul has installed Fran above her as sub-team leader. Out in space, stars are born and die and black holes suck matter ever inwards to the indifference of the cosmos. But Jess is still annoyed about the whole sub-team thing. And that\u2019s why we love her. If I were Paul and Fran, I\u2019d be down the supermarket pronto and making the canap\u00e9s myself. Show some initiative. Dillon and Alanna spend money on catering while Paul and Fran try to cater for a crowd they can\u2019t afford to feed. They are actually cross that the sales team have sold so many tickets. Surely, Alan won\u2019t go for this attitude. Grainne and Courtney realise that the mermaid they\u2019ve been selling tickets for is not actually going to get wet or submerse herself in water in any way. She is, in fact, as Karrren points out, just a woman and not an actual mermaid at all. Call Trades Descriptions immediately. I feel cheated. Grainne spots that the people they\u2019re trying to accost at St Pancras are all running for trains and are not interested in stopping and planning some fifty quid Under the Sea night on their way home. Fran is as thick as thieves with Paul as he transfers her to Jess\u2019s sub-team to keep an eye on his loosest cannon. She won\u2019t like that. Fran quizzes the guy at Tussaud\u2019s about how much to charge for their event. It turns out that Jess was right to cut the ticket price to \u00a335 but she has told her punters that includes hot food and it now doesn\u2019t. OH NO. This will be the hot potato in tonight\u2019s boardroom. \u201cOO,\u201d Alan will say. \u201cOO decided to charge thirty five nicker for a ticket and not feed the bleedin\u2019 punters?\u201d If this is the end for Jessica I shall be cross. At least she\u2019s entertaining and she\u2019s mostly been able to squash down the spirit of Jim Carey throughout this process. Dillon and Alanna watch a mermaid singing something from The Little Mermaid and Dillon knows ALL the worlds. He\u2019s enchanted and suggests that he should dress as a sailor. No one has asked him to, but he is determined and I would suggest not standing in his way at this point. Courtney and Grainne try a similar but more polite approach and immediately employ the word \u201cyourself\u201d where \u201cyou\u201d would have done as well. It\u2019s what I watch this show for, a peak into the world of someone who completely misunderstands the power of language and just bludgeons folk with it. It\u2019s like reading that transcript of Donal Trump at the New York Times. Absolute guff. It\u2019s straight onto food tasting as Paul\u2019s team stuff their faces and make MMMM noises. With their mouths still full, they choose a burger. A fifty quid burger. It\u2019s lunchtime in the city of London and Jessica is flogging their entertainment package to city workers to people just like her. They all nod but none of them actually open their wallets. She drops the price drastically for a group booking but she has literally grabbed that figure out of the air. At least she\u2019s actually sold something. Claude nay-says from the off as he watches Paul writes hot food buffet cheques that his team can\u2019t cash. They all agree with him and he impresses upon him that any failure to sell the \u00a350 tickets is on the sales team, not him. Paul\u2019s team lap up his suggestion of a \u201cfun casino\u201d. Spot prizes for Royal Flush? A gunging if you lose at roulette? Count me IN. Paul and Jessica both want to be PM and verbally throw their fighting cocks into the ring. Jess is a woman so immediately loses to Paul the minute a man speaks up for him. She is un-pleased but, like a woman, surrenders the field while biting her lip. Courtney is trying to make their do a dating-related thing. Dillon suggests an underwater theme for their aquarium do. How DOES he come up with this stuff? It\u2019s just off Trafalgar Square where there is now such a proliferation of those floating Yoda human statues it actually makes me quite angry. It was clever once but now it just looks like sarcasm. Alan has chosen the London Aquarium for one team and Madame Tussaud\u2019s for the other. They must hold eventy type things in said venues, sell tickets and make some flipping money. So, it is week eight and that means the calls are getting more sarcastically early. This week, a 5am call informs the wallies they need to open their sleep-crusted eyes and get to the National Portrait Gallery, pronto. \u201cYour task is very simple, pick the right boating products,\u201d says Alan in the flashback to last week. What a ridiculous sentence. In no other arena would that be an OK thing to say to another human. I love/hate this silly programme. I like how they haven\u2019t changed it over the years. Apart from making the contestants more flamboyantly stupid. Right, lower your expectations. It\u2019s time for Alan and his merry band of desperadoes to dance the dance of the fiscally dim. Who was looking wobbly last week? Who do we think is in the cross-hairs going into the dressing up and looking stupid task? 10 Rillington Place, on the other hand, looks absolutely brilliant. Just in case you were wondering if you should switch over to BBC Two now to get a bit of culture with that Stephen Poliakov drama, don\u2019t bother. It\u2019s rubbish. Stick with us for another 60 minutes of unadulterated schadenfreude. Holding his little boy aloft like he\u2019s the future king. He\u2019s actually a bit breathless. Is there a way, in these crazy times, that the line of succession could be jiggered to give Dyer the throne when her maj breathes her last? I think we\u2019d all be fine with that. At the risk of live blogging Danny Dyer\u2019s Who Do You Think You Are, I cannot take my eyes and ears off it and don\u2019t want it to end. \u201cMy blood is his blood,\u201d he says of Henry III. Imagine living with Danny Dyer after he made this show? The surreptitious ordering of a crown from the Past Times catalogue. Commissioning a Dyer coat of arms. God, I love him. The Apprentice is all very well, but hands up if you\u2019d rather just have another hour of Danny Dyer dumb with awe at his heritage? *counts hands* Yes, that\u2019s everyone. But in the meantime, please enjoy Danny Dyer repeating the mantra \u201cI am a direct descendent of Thomas Cromwell\u201d over and over. It\u2019s mesmeric. So we said goodbye to Karthik and Samuel in last week\u2019s nautical blood-bath. Big Al didn\u2019t event wait for the final firing squad to give old Karthik the finger, so keen was he to see the back of the self-styled Special K, or whatever he called himself. This week, the remaining liabilities must dress up in humiliating costumes to flog experience packages to tourists in London. Grainne in a mermaid costume, Courtney as a lack lustre pirate asking if punters want to \u201cget drunk with the fishes\u201d. It\u2019s got classic written all over it. Join me here just before 9pm and buy a ticket to gawp at the inmates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
