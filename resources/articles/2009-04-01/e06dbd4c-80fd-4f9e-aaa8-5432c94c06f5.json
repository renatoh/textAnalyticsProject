The central defender was carried off with a medial ligament knee injury in Tuesday's 1\u20131 draw with the Spanish side Villarreal in the first leg of Arsenal's Champions League quarter-final. Wenger confirmed Gallas is almost certainly ruled out for the rest of the season but rejected the possibility that his former captain, who joined from Chelsea in 2006, will not be at the club next year. \"That's a big question,\" Wenger said. \"No, because he has a one year contract to go. I envisage him to be here next year.\" The speculation derives from Gallas's travails this season, which included a loss of form and personal disaffection with the club's fortunes during the autumn. He was stripped of the captaincy following public criticism of his Arsenal team-mates when on international duty with France. \"He's had a challenging season,\" said Wenger. \"I believe he has certainly had to cope with a major disappointment. But we have to give him a lot of credit, because he came back with great performances, so he dealt well with the situation.\" Gallas's form since Cesc F\u00e1bregas replaced him as captain has gradually improved. \"He's turned up in the big games with goals, when it matters, so that is very important,\" said Wenger. Wenger also lost his goalkeeper, Manuel Almunia, and a third member of his back four, Ga\u00ebl Clichy, to injury on Tuesday. The pair will be out for around three and two weeks respectively. Arsenal have potentially 13 more games before the close of the season if they were to reach the finals of the Champions League and FA Cup. Wenger accepted his defensive options are becoming ever more limited. \"We don't have too many [defenders]. We have Mika\u00ebl Silvestre, we have Johan Djourou, but, of course, at the back we are a bit short.\" That means the 19-year-old Kieran Gibbs will replace Clichy for Arsenal's visit to Wigan in the Premier League tomorrow and, almost certainly, the return leg with Villarreal and next weekend's FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea at Wembley. \"I will see as well how he [Gibbs] plays on Saturday. I am confident he will do well,\" said Wenger The Wigan manager, Steve Bruce, has his own problems and has said the future of striker Amr Zaki, who did not return from international duty with Egypt on time this week, will be decided today when he meets the player and his advisors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
