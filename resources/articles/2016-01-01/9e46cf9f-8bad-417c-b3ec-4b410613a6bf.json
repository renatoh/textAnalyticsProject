Skywriters captured public attention with messages reading \u201cAmerica is great. Trump is disgusting\u201d and \u201cIowans dump Trump\u201d, dotted through a cloudless sky. Though Trump was notified of the skywriting through his Twitter account, as of Friday afternoon he had not responded. Amazement from the crowd was apparent in social media posts. One video captured the remarks of an onlooker: \u201cOh my god, I love it so much\u201d. Each year, about 700,000 people attend the parade. Social media posts about the skywriting appear to have begun about 40 minutes after the last float started driving the roughly five and a half mile route. The Rose Parade ended a little after 1pm ET, according to the LA Times. The festivities are expected to continue as the Iowa Hawkeyes played the Stanford Cardinal in the college football Rose Bowl. The Hawkeyes hail from the nation\u2019s first caucus state, which is scheduled to vote on 1 February. Trump trails Texas senator Ted Cruz in most polls concerning the Republican presidential field in Iowa. The anti-Trump messages did not represent the only politicking of the afternoon. After the parade, demonstrators produced a grinning papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 float homage to the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, and rolled the likeness down Colorado Boulevard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
