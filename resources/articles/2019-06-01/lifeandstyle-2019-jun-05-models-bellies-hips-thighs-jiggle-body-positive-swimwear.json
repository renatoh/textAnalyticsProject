Which makes it a strange coincidence that, on the day we speak, Khan has just been bikini shopping. \u201cI buy swimwear about once every 10 years,\u201d she says. The 23-year-old charity worker from London is flying to Ibiza tomorrow. \u201cI always put it off. I hate it. It\u2019s like having to go to the dentist or get your eyes tested.\u201d The reason Khan hates bikini shopping is because she is a size 10-12, with a 32FF bust, and few retailers design swimwear for women with relatively narrow backs and larger cup sizes. Khan isn\u2019t alone. \u201cI heard at least two or three other people in the changing rooms today saying: \u2018Oh God, I can never find anything.\u2019\u201d It will be a familiar grievance to many women as holiday season approaches \u2013 frowning at their reflections in starkly lit mirrors as they attempt to wriggle and contort themselves into high-street swimming costumes that seem to be made with no consideration of women\u2019s bodies. \u201cIt\u2019s such an emotional drain,\u201d Khan says. \u201cEven if you\u2019ve bought something, you always leave feeling deflated afterwards.\u201d Canvassing women about their experiences of buying swimwear on the high street, the feedback was astonishingly negative: tales of bikini bottoms so tiny that most of your rear end is on show, or cut too tight on the thigh so that you can barely get a leg inside them. Taller women find swimsuits are never long enough, so they get a perpetual wedgie. For women who don\u2019t fit into the 6-16 range offered by most high-street shops, the choice is limited to matronly control-wear and billowing kaftans \u2013 the assumption being that plus-sized women are ashamed of their bodies and want to disappear. \u201cIt fits into the narrative, which I think a lot of us have internalised, that your body is wrong for the clothes, rather than the clothes being wrong for your body,\u201d says Stephanie Boland, 28, from London, who is a bra size 28FF. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing to buy things that are supposedly in your size and find they don\u2019t fit at all.\u201d Often women end up with the thing that is the closest to fitting. Plus-size blogger Hollie Burgess, 33, from Nottingham, remembers her first holiday abroad, aged 18. All she could find in her size was a brown tankini, which she hated. \u201cMy size just wasn\u2019t there in shops,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember thinking: everyone else can wear what they want and I\u2019m wearing this.\u201d Things are looking up, however, and it\u2019s all thanks to the internet. \u201cIf we think about online providers, in effect they have endless aisles, which means that they can store unlimited inventory,\u201d explains Jonathan Reynolds, a retail expert at the University of Oxford. High-street shops tend not to stock what is known as the \u201c\u2018long tail\u2019, stuff that might broaden your range, but doesn\u2019t sell frequently enough to justify its space on the shelf\u201d. This may not be a sensible commercial decision for long. According to market researchers Mintel, 18% of women buy plus-size clothing, defined as a size 18 or above. Online-only retailers such as Asos, Missguided and Boohoo have proved particularly adept in targeting these consumers. And, even for women who are not plus-sized, online shopping takes the sting out of swimwear purchasing. \u201cNo longer are people going in, picking up a swimsuit from a rack, going to a changing room, trying it on, looking at it in the mirror with harsh lighting and feeling bad about their bodies,\u201d says Steven Wright, a senior lecturer in fashion design at the University of South Wales. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is people purchasing multiple swimsuits online, trying them on in their own home and sending the remainder back.\u201d Brands catering to women shut out of the British high street have experienced remarkable growth. Bravissimo, which specialises in swimwear for women with larger busts, saw its sales increase by 3.4% to \u00a351.9m in 2017. Lyra Swim \u2013 a modest swimwear brand founded in 2017 by Ikram Zein, who was tired of never being able to find swimwear that felt acceptable for her Islamic faith \u2013 has grown 300% year-on-year. \u201cI\u2019m surprised by how quickly we\u2019ve grown,\u201d she says. This is particularly because not all of her customers are Muslim \u2013 some want to cover up because they want sun protection or feel body-conscious. (Nigella Lawson was spotted wearing a burkini on Bondi beach in 2011; she didn\u2019t want to get a tan.) New players are entering the market. Elise Wallbank launched Youswim in June 2018, after discovering a stretchable nylon fabric that could be made into an outfit that would accommodate a range of sizes. The brand\u2019s swimwear fits size 6 to 14, but Wallbank acknowledges there is \u201cwork to do in terms of being more inclusive\u201d for bigger women. Browsing Youswim\u2019s website, women of different sizes beam back at you. They have pot bellies, wide hips and thighs that jiggle. They look wonderful. \u201cFrom the outset, I never wanted the swimwear to be displayed on your typical size 8, blond model on a beach ... because it works on such a diverse range of sizes, it seems counter-intuitive to not represent that market in the way that you advertise your product.\u201d Brands like Youswim have a simple aesthetic \u2013 minimal one-pieces and bikinis, without adornments, underwiring or padding, in a stretchable, one-size-fits-all \u201ccrinkle\u201d fabric \u2013 that is indebted to luxury swimwear brand Hunza G. Even if you have never heard of Hunza G, you have almost certainly seen a knock-off by now. There are no dangling bits of string or complicated halter-tops to tie. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to design something that felt really complicated that you couldn\u2019t swim in,\u201d explains the brand\u2019s creative director, Georgiana Huddart. \u201cYears ago, all the brands that were really successful had cutouts, diamante bits, little metal things hanging off them. It was unusual to find something quite sporty and simple, but fashionable.\u201d Hunza G costumes and those like them are popular because the material moulds itself to your body, meaning it fits women who are different sizes on top and bottom. As the material is thick, you feel contained \u2013 your bits aren\u2019t going to lurch anywhere. \u201cFashion has taken a turn for the functional over the last few years,\u201d explains Wright. \u201cWhat we saw 10 years ago was effectively several triangles of Lycra worn on the body. Now we\u2019re seeing moulded, tech-fabric-driven garments that provide the body with a bit more of an equipment base.\u201d But with designs starting at \u00a3130, Hunza G is expensive, and it is not currently suitable for plus-size women, only fitting up to a size 14. (Huddart plans to introduce a version to fit up to a size 20 next year.) One retailer cornering this market is Wolf &amp; Whistle. With sizing from 32B and 42F, and a dress size 26, it offers trends-driven swimwear that caters for plus-size and big-breasted women. \u201cOften when people do plus-size or fuller-bust swimwear, they make it dowdy,\u201d explains the co-founder Emma Parker. She wanted to make swimwear that was as \u201csexy and fashionable and revealing and brightly coloured\u201d as anything on the high street. The bigger range of sizes does add to the brand\u2019s production expenses, but Parker thinks it is worth it to cater to women of all sizes. \u201cIt normalises bodies, having them all in there together.\u201d Eventually, Khan bought a yellow bikini from Bravissimo, a specialist store for women with larger breasts. It fit perfectly, but, at \u00a360, was more expensive than she was hoping for. \u201cThe garments cost more to produce,\u201d explains Clare Turner, a senior supply and merchandising manager at Bravissimo, \u201c[because] if you\u2019ve got a swimsuit on the high street that\u2019s just a pull-on swimsuit, it could just use one fabric, or maybe a very thin liner. Whereas a cup size and wired swimsuit might have the outer fabric, the liner in the body, and then it\u2019s essentially got a full bra inside ... it\u2019s two products in one.\u201d There\u2019s still a way to go, particularly when it comes to sustainability. Wolf &amp; Whistle\u2019s recycled swimwear collection isn\u2019t available in plus-size. Although Youswim\u2019s garments are ethically manufactured in the UK, and Lyra Swim uses a Turkish factory that is audited by the Fair Wear Foundation, it is still the case that many consumers favour fast-fashion brands. Although they may have affordable and size-inclusive ranges, some such brands have poor records when it comes to worker rights and are some of the biggest contributors to the estimated \u00a3140m of clothing sent to landfill every year. Gripes aside, there is no doubt things are improving. \u201cYou have a choice now, whereas you never used to,\u201d says Burgess. \u201cDifferent shapes, different cuts, different colours. The brands are slowly doing better.\u201d She tells me about her favourite yellow swimsuit. It is from Forever 21, and has a cutout detail and bow at the front. \u201cIt\u2019s miles away from the tankini I bought when I was 18!\u201d The first time Burgess wore it, on holiday with her fiance in Magaluf in 2014, it was game-changing. \u201cI felt comfortable in what I was wearing, and I felt good.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2019 to clarify that Lyra Swim uses a factory that is audited by, rather than part of, the Fair Wear Foundation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
