Very few of us, I dare say, have subjected the 1924 Surrealist Manifesto to a close reading \u2013 it is not a page turner, quite frankly, and you might find Dan Brown more gem\u00fctlich for the beach \u2013 and yet we go around branding all sorts of things surreal purely on the basis that they confound expectations, or feature a bowler hat or a fish in some sort of unlikely circumstances. Roger Federer's semi-final against Novak Djokovic in the Miami Masters featured neither, but that did not stop Marcus Buckland on Sky calling it \"tense and surreal\". In fairness to the presenter, when Federer smashed his racket on the ground in frustration, the head did end up looking like one of Salvador Dali's melting clocks. The world No2 really whacked his axe into the deck, like one of Pete Townshend's guitars, in one of the most unexpected \u2013 not surreal \u2013 moments of the week. Federer has been such an unshifting paragon of cool self-control in a sporting landscape of tears, tantrums, and two-fingered gestures that his sudden loss of equilibrium reminded me of that Simpsons episode where Ned Flanders turns on the Springfield townsfolk and gives them a piece of his diddly-iddly mind. Buckland, who is something of an unruffled presence himself, was clearly shaken. \"No handshake for umpire Fergus Murphy afterwards either,\" he gasped. And blow me, if Federer did not display a hitherto well-hidden penchant for sarcasm in the post-match press conference. \"I've been winning 20 tournaments in a row, so nobody expects me to win really,\" was his response to a question we did not hear, but was probably about media speculation that his powers are waning. \"It's the end of the hard-court season and I don't care any more,\" he said, with a hint of a bitter and twisted smile. \"Thank God the hard-court season is over.\" When asked if he had \"lost it\" he countered: \"Just because I smashed a racket doesn't mean I lose it. You write what you want.\" Molly from Wimbledon did, emailing the studio to say Federer had gone down in her estimation. \"He's a bad loser,\" she wrote, which could be awkward if Roger is looking for digs in the area in the summer. Studio pundit Peter Fleming, John McEnroe's former doubles partner, was more indulgent. \"We all have to get a grip here,\" he said. \"People have been telling him he is over the hill for the past year, he's lost confidence, and it's a scary place to be. As a super-human athlete, suddenly to lose your powers, if ever so slightly, you think, 'Is this the beginning of the end?' That can be scary, and it all just bubbled to the surface.\" Not that surreal, then, but possibly ironic, because just as Federer is shown to have feet of clay, he is looking forward to playing on clay. Geddit? Also not surreal was Mick Fitzgerald's return to Aintree after his terrifying fall on L'Ami last year. \"It's surreal being back here,\" he told Clare Balding after one of the several re-runs of the footage of last year's accident. Lucky, I think, was the word he wanted. Another Fitzgerald clip on heavy rotation was the one where he says winning the National is better than sex. This was showing more or less on the hour every hour, and was included in a fine montage marking 50 years of TV coverage of the race, featuring all the great presenters of the past, and prompting the question, \"Ou sont les Frank Boughs d'antan?\" Not that Clare, who did a bang-up job as always, would be out of place in the pantheon. But if it is surreal you want, how about this? I am half awake on Saturday morning, listening to a news bulletin on the radio. What they are saying, I suspect, is, \"Poor weather may have stopped the Koreans from launching a rocket,\" but what I hear, clear as you like, is: \"Paul Weller may have stopped the Koreans from launching a rocket.\" Fair play, I thought. The Style Council back catalogue probably does not mean much in North Korea, the local version of Top Of The Pops preferring songs like \"Long Life and Good Health to the Leader,\" and \"We Sing of His Benevolent Love,\" so it must take real courage for the dad rock icon, who has not previously been notably politically engaged, to take on the Axis of Evil, which is not surreal in the strictest sense, but closer than Federer smashing his racket. martin.kelner@yahoo.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
