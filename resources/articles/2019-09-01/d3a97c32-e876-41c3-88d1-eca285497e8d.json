The Everton manager gave an impassioned defence of his team and methods on Friday having clearly been stung by the reaction to the error-strewn defeat at Bournemouth. Silva admitted Everton fans had every right to be frustrated with their team\u2019s latest away defeat and Sunday\u2019s performance at the Vitality Stadium. But he believes that fuelled broader criticism of Everton\u2019s season that is unwarranted. \u201cIn my opinion it is so easy to create a crisis inside Everton football club,\u201d Silva said. \u201cI know why but it is not my job to talk about that. I look at the table now and you have first position and then the second-placed team with 10 points. After that there\u2019s a big group with eight points and a big group with seven points. Some of those teams on eight points prepared the season to be champion and I hear they are doing a fantastic season. Everton has seven points and it\u2019s: \u2018Big crisis, everything is bad inside.\u2019 It is up to me as the manager to block that out. Was I happy with the last game? 100% no. We lost an opportunity to make a big statement at Bournemouth.\u201d Silva refused to elaborate on why he perceives Everton to be judged to a more critical standard than other clubs. When it was put to him that the club\u2019s heavy spending under the major shareholder Moshiri was a factor, he replied: \u201cYes, but let me know if the other clubs don\u2019t have owners as well and don\u2019t spend big money. I know the reason but it is not for me to say it. \u201cIt is up to us to block this out. In our dressing room and inside our club we have to close off from this. \u201cWe give 100% commitment to our shirt, to our club and we are demanding of ourselves. We know our target and what we are fighting for. We have to show personality and everything else we have to block out like ice men and not give it a chance to come into our dressing room.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
