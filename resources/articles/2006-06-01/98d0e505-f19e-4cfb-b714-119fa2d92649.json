You don't have to stump up a deposit or turn to parents for financial help. Research this week claimed first-timers in London would need to save, on average, for more than six years to get enough money for a 10% deposit on their first home. They would have to save until July 2012 to amass \u00a325,183 (10% of the estimated average price likely to be paid by first-time buyers in six years' time), according to the Co-operative Bank. It assumed people saved an average of just over \u00a3300 a month, and that house prices increase by 3.6% a year. Chipping in The chip and pin system is so \"seriously flawed\" that millions of cardholders are dangerously exposed to criminals, according to a report in the Daily Mail this week. It quoted experts who said there was a one in five chance that a retailer would not spot a cloned card - and blamed Britain's banks for opting for a cut-price system known as SDA (static data authentication). But banking industry payment body Apacs says there is no evidence to date of any cloned SDA card fraud in the UK. And it adds that even if someone did manage to successfully clone a chip and pin card, they would still need the cardholder's pin to use it. Pension referee One of the stars of the last World Cup, the iconic Italian referee Pierluigi Collina, was the special guest at the National Association of Pension Funds annual conference in east London this week. The scary-looking Collina retired from the pitch last year, though he made something of a comeback at the Soccer Aid charity match at Old Trafford a fortnight ago. He won't have been blinded by all that pensions science at the NAPF conference, because he works as a financial adviser (though imagine going to your bank to talk to someone about Isas and finding yourself confronted by old Nosferatu features). And it looks like Collina doesn't need to worry about his own pension either. As well as landing the NAPF gig, he could be found promoting Vauxhall cars in a Daily Mirror advertising feature this week. Quietly does it Barclays and its Woolwich arm have quietly cut some of their savings rates by up to 0.45%. In a few cases they have also raised rates. It is Isas that have suffered the biggest hack. Those people with \u00a39,000 or more in a Barclays or Woolwich mini cash Isa have seen 0.45% lopped off their rate, taking it down to between 4% and 4.55% gross, depending on the balance. And most Barclays variable rate Isa savers have seen their rate fall by at least 0.2%. However, Woolwich for Kids account holders have been handed a rate rise. Barclays didn't put out a press release to tell people about the cuts; it puts ads in two newspapers (not the Guardian). What's more, the ads appeared on Monday June 5, yet the cuts took effect on June 1. Who benefits? Neighbours from hell could be stripped of their housing benefit as part of a get-tough initiative announced by the government this week. It will be piloting a scheme which will target people who are evicted for antisocial behaviour. Ministers say it is not right that those who are evicted are simply able to move to other areas and make more people's lives a misery, while continuing to enjoy taxpayer-funded benefits. So they are proposing that those who refuse to address their problem behaviour would lose first some, and then all, of their housing benefit. Some might suggest that threatening to strip them of their Sky Sports packages might be more effective, but not I... Group activity Several more credit card companies have announced they are cutting their penalty charges in order to avoid invoking the wrath of the Office of Fair Trading. First, Barclays, Lloyds TSB and HSBC said they would be cutting their fees for late payment and for exceeding your credit limit from \u00a320 to \u00a312 following a ruling by the consumer watchdog. Now they have been joined by the HBOS group, which includes Halifax, Bank of Scotland and Intelligent Finance, plus MBNA and Nationwide building society. Some of them are not exactly happy about it. MBNA says it \"continues to disagree with the OFT's legal conclusion and maintains that its fees have always been fair, transparent and legal\". Yeah, right. Passion killer Two new credit cards were unveiled this week aimed at Britain's army of Mini and BMW drivers. American Express has teamed up with BMW to launch the cards, which will each offer a rewards programme that provides cardholders with the opportunity to win experiences and products \"which reflect their passion for the cars\". Beemer nerds will doubtless be champing at the bit when they hear what one of the top prizes is: a VIP trip to the BMW plant in Leipzig, Germany. The rest of us might give that one a miss. The fee-free cards both have a typical interest rate for purchases of 9.9% APR. For more information go to moneybymini.co.uk or bmwcard.co.uk. Taking the credit Nationwide building society is launching a TV ad on Monday which will highlight one of the tricks of the credit card trade. It aims to raise awareness of the fact that most UK card providers schedule repayments so that customers pay off the most expensive transactions (such as purchases and cash withdrawals) last, and the cheapest debt (like transferred balances) first. Nationwide claims to be the only major card issuer that applies payments to the most expensive debt first, across all its cards, saving some customers \u00a3100 or more a year in interest. It wants the rest of the industry to also \"play fair\". The new ad stars Mark Benton as a pompous bank manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
