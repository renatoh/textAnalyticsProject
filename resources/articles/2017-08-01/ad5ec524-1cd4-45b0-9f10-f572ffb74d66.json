Everton have not conceded in their first four competitive matches of this campaign having shut out Ruzomberok and Hajduk Split in the Europa League, plus Stoke City in the Premier League. Jordan Pickford and Michael Keane, the joint record signings until the \u00a345m arrival of Gylfi Sigurdsson last week, have impressed in the new-look defence, moreover, but with City having also strengthened this summer, the Everton manager believes his players will face their sternest test so far at the Etihad Stadium. Asked whether Pickford would find it easy to collect another clean sheet against Pep Guardiola\u2019s team, Koeman replied: \u201cIf we get a clean sheet on Monday I don\u2019t know if it will be a miracle. Maybe it will but we do know we are strong defensively, our defensive organisation is strong. The key to getting a good result is what we do when we have the ball and that\u2019s what our preparation will be about. You have different ways to play, we will look at the best way to get a good result.\u201d Everton benefited from defensive and offensive approaches against City last season, securing a 1-1 draw at the Etihad, thanks to two penalty saves from Maarten Stekelenburg, and a 4-0 win at home, when punishing a chaotic City defence. \u201cI am a good friend of Pep and I know the way he likes to play,\u201d said Koeman, a former room-mate of Guardiola\u2019s at Barcelona. \u201cIt\u2019s the most difficult way. It\u2019s really a pleasure to see his teams playing football, with a high defence and a lot of offensive players in the team. But the Premier League sometimes is strong and physical, plus if you play with a high defence there is always space behind. \u201cWhen we played City at home we punished them for that but I think with the business they did in the summer City are stronger than last year.\u201d The Everton manager had claimed City were favourites for the 2016-17 Premier League title after October\u2019s draw at the Etihad. By January, however, and the heaviest league defeat of his managerial career, Guardiola conceded at Goodison his team were out of the race. Koeman is wary of making a similar prediction this season. He added: \u201cWhen we played at City last season I mentioned that we were really lucky to get one point out of that game. On that day they played fantastic football and I spoke about them being the big favourites to win the league. After that they started to struggle but that\u2019s football, you never know, it\u2019s difficult to make predictions about who is the strongest. After the first weekend of this season, watching different teams, I was impressed by [Manchester] United, also impressed by City, but maybe in two weeks or two months it can be different. City are strong, of course they are strong.\u201d Everton took their summer spending past the \u00a3140m mark last week when completing the signing of Sigurdsson from Swansea. The Iceland midfielder is short of match fitness but will be involved in Everton\u2019s demanding week of fixtures at City, Hajduk Split and Chelsea. Koeman believes his team require another striker but have the right balance following the summer\u2019s investment. \u201cWhat you try to do is find a really good balance in your team of age and experience,\u201d he added. \u201cWe brought a really young goalkeeper in Pickford and he is doing fantastic. Michael Keane can be one of the best central defenders in the Premier League and along with Sandro Ram\u00edrez and Davy Klaassen, we have brought in young players with a future, that is what you always need to find for balance. \u201cWith Wayne and Gylfi it is about experience. Wayne Rooney, for example, won a lot of titles and that experience is really important for a team that wants to win titles.\u201d As a former United captain, Rooney will be guaranteed a hostile reception on his return to the blue side of Manchester but Koeman insisted: \u201cHe knows that stadium, it\u2019s not the first time he has been there to play City. \u201cHe might get a certain reception but he\u2019s such an experienced player he\u2019s not going to lose any sleep over it. He will like that platform to play football.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
