The Premier League champions have also opened talks with Juventus to sign Portugal full-back Jo\u00e3o Cancelo. The 22-year-old is understood to have informed Atl\u00e9tico that he would favour a transfer this summer, with City now in pole position to sign a player identified as Pep Guardiola\u2019s preferred central midfield target. Rodri\u2019s representatives have already held talks with City over personal terms, with the former Villarreal player believed to be weighing up his options amid interest from Bayern Munich. Born in Madrid, Rodri was released from Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s youth system as a teenager but returned last summer for just \u20ac20m. Diego Simeone\u2019s side are hoping to sign Marcos Llorente from Real Madrid as his replacement for \u20ac40m. Meanwhile, City are confident they will sign Cancelo from the Italian champions after offering around \u20ac45m for the 25-year-old defender. Guardiola is keen to bring in the former Benfica player to add competition for Kyle Walker at right-back, while Manchester United have also shown interest in a player who Juventus value at closer to \u20ac60m. City have proposed including Brazilian defender Danilo as part of the deal, although the Italian champions are understood to prefer alternative replacements."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
