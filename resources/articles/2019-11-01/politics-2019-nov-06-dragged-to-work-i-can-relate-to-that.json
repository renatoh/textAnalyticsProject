I can relate to that", "bodyText": "Well done, Gary Younge, on your appointment as professor (Report, 6 November). You have a rare talent that makes a reader feel present. I recall a May 2014 article recounting your two meetings with the late Maya Angelou which does it in spades: \u201cAs her car pulled away after dropping me off at the hotel, she put her head out of the window, waved, and shouted like a teenage girl: \u2018That\u2019s swanky!\u2019 She was 74 and high on life.\u201d Siobh\u00e1n N\u00ed Chuanaigh Dublin, Ireland \u2022 David Dimbleby\u2019s vox pop sessions for Panorama, previewed on Radio 4, included a woman from Merthyr who declared she would be voting for Boris Johnson because \u201che has balls of steel\u201d. Does she have any evidence for this assertion? I think we should be told. Even if true, is testicular composition a good basis for our voting decisions? Cherry Weston Wolverhampton \u2022 I\u2019m happy my colleague Stephen Morris has had his violin returned (Report, 4 November). When I left my viola on a train at West Hampstead in 1990 after a long day in the pub, I never saw it again. I hope it gives its current custodian the pleasure that only a viola can. Bill Hawkes Canterbury, Kent \u2022 In 1992, while living in Tokyo, I left my bag on a train at Ginza station at around 1pm. At 10.15pm I happened to get on the same carriage going home, and there it was, untouched. Peter Stewart London \u2022 It\u2019s a shame I was not eligible to be Speaker. I certainly feel like I need to be dragged to work some mornings (MPs vote for Hoyle as new Speaker of the Commons, 5 November).
