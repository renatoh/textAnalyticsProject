She had arrived with a group of friends in the early morning to show gratitude toward the outgoing president, one day before Donald Trump would be sworn in as his successor. They hoisted a sign that read \u201cThank you President Obama: Your grace still echoes above the noise\u201d on a busy street that lines Lafayette Square, a public park situated north of the White House now barricaded by a chain-linked fence as part of preparations for Trump\u2019s inauguration. Cars zipping by the group expressed their approval with a honk of their horns, as some rolled down their windows to pump a fist in the air or offer a thumbs-up. This city voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump by 92.8% to 4.1% in November\u2019s election. Several of those walking through the area, many of them tourists, cheered upon catching a glimpse of the pro-Obama banner. Metzger, a Washington resident, deemed her attachment to Obama personal. His landmark healthcare law was a life-saving policy for Metzger, who said she had suffered from a chronic illness for 17 years and before the Affordable Care Act\u2019s passage paid high premiums due to her pre-existing condition. \u201cObamacare was a very big deal for me personally,\u201d she said. \u201c[It] saved me literally thousands of dollars per year, so I\u2019m very emotional about it, and I\u2019m very terrified right now, frankly.\u201d Metzger said she had no plans to watch Trump, who has vowed to repeal Obama\u2019s healthcare law, take his oath of office on Friday. She will instead spend the day readying her modest apartment to host guests for the Women\u2019s March on Washington, a highly publicized event expected to draw as many as 200,000 protesters on Saturday. \u201cMy friends have agreed they\u2019ll push me in my wheelchair if necessary,\u201d said Metzger, who is holding out hope that Republicans might still improve upon the existing healthcare law rather than dismantle it. Standing at her side was Amy Lewis, an acupuncturist who has treated Metzger and who organized the gathering of Obama supporters. Lewis, who lives in Maryland, said it was a simple thought born from her desire to thank the president and his family as they depart the White House after eight years. \u201cI\u2019ll miss his grace under fire, I\u2019ll miss his fairness, I\u2019ll miss his inclusion for everyone in this country,\u201d Lewis said of Obama. Like several other supporters, she had posted an event on Facebook for those who might wish to join her outside the White House on Obama\u2019s final day. Although the space directly outside the president\u2019s home was walled off for Trump\u2019s inauguration parade, Lewis was joined by others on the sidewalk across the park with similar ideas \u2013 some of them strangers. They included Jennifer Breaux, a law student at Howard University who brandished her own sign reading: \u201cYes you did\u201d, a play on Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign slogan \u201cYes we can\u201d. It was a quiet sendoff for a president who will leave office with one of the highest approval ratings of any previous occupant of the Oval Office. A larger rally, dubbed \u201cThanks Obama\u201d, was expected to draw thousands in south-west Washington later in the day. That effort also stemmed from a mere Facebook post, but due to its spike in popularity transformed into a paying event for which tickets quickly sold out. But that didn\u2019t stop others from perching themselves as close to the White House as possible to bid farewell. \u201cThank you, Mr President,\u201d read one sign, while another saluted his deputy with the words: \u201cSay it ain\u2019t so, Joe.\u201d \u201cI just want to share my gratitude and appreciation for the last eight years,\u201d said Breaux. \u201cHe\u2019s been a fantastic leader, a great role model, and just a generally beautiful human being.\u201d Asked if she was concerned by the tone of his successor, Breaux said she did not wish to get \u201cbogged down by the negativity\u201d. While feeling that any rational person would be \u201cheavily concerned\u201d by the tenor of Trump\u2019s campaign, Breaux said she planned to heed Obama\u2019s advice: \u201cLet\u2019s not panic until we have to.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in law school now, studying civil rights law,\u201d she added with a wry smile. \u201cSo I feel like I\u2019ll be prepared.\u201d Lewis said she was \u201cdepressed and disappointed and terrified for our country\u201d, but similarly opted for a positive approach. \u201cI think we\u2019ve taken a significant step back, but as Dr Martin Luther King said, \u2018The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u2019\u201d Her husband, Ken Jenkins, said the setback for Obama supporters in no way undermined how they viewed his tenure. Jenkins, a former NFL player, ticked off the expansion of healthcare coverage, economic recovery, and revival of the US auto industry among the achievements for which the outgoing administration would be remembered. \u201cHe did it against a do-nothing Congress who, frankly, from a black person\u2019s point of view, they didn\u2019t want that young, intelligent black man telling them what to do,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel about it \u2013 I think that\u2019s how a lot of black Americans feel about it. \u201cHe did it against all odds,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I hope his real legacy ends up being.\u201d Across town from the White House, as many as 700 were expected to fill an event space reserved for the official \u201cThanks Obama\u201d event that grew organically from a Facebook post to a decidedly greater ordeal. A few hundred milled in and out of the building, known as Arena Stage, situated a stone\u2019s throw away from the US Capitol. They swayed to live music performed by local artists and cheered a group of hula dancers in a nod to Obama\u2019s birthplace of Hawaii. Jan Percival flew across the country, from her home of San Diego, California, to take part in the evening\u2019s festivities. While she had initially hoped to get closer to the White House, Percival said she was happy to take in Obama\u2019s last day with her \u201ctribe\u201d. \u201cMy heart is broken that he\u2019s leaving, and I just really wanted to express my personal thanks to him for his leadership and the sacrifice of his family,\u201d she said. \u201cThe man is incredible.\u201d Unlike many other Obama fans, Percival said she would attend Trump\u2019s inauguration while in town after receiving a ticket from a friend who worked on the organizing committee. \u201cYou know what, it\u2019s history,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about it, I\u2019m not celebrating \u2026 but I\u2019m still going to go.\u201d Percival noted, however, that she planned to wear a \u201cpussy hat\u201d \u2013 a knit hat with little ears donned by women in reference to leaked audio of Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women \u2013 \u201cin silent protest\u201d. Organizers sought to keep the spotlight on Obama, rather than dwelling on the next commander-in-chief. Walls were covered in white poster board, where attendees left messages thanking Obama for his service. A representative from a local performing arts collective, One Love Massive, told the crowd the purpose of the gathering was to reflect on the historic nature of Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cWhen I was growing up, the idea of a black president was almost an anathema,\u201d the man said. \u201cMy children were born in an era where a black president was just a matter of fact.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
