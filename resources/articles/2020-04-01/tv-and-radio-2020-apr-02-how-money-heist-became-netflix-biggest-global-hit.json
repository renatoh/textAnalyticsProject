But wait: there\u2019s a world-changing, cultural juggernaut of a TV show that \u2013 while hugely popular \u2013 you may well have missed. This week, Money Heist \u2013 or, to use its Spanish title, La Casa de Papel \u2013 begins another eight-episode run on Netflix, where it is the streaming giant\u2019s most-watched non-English language show worldwide. The first season of the full-throttle thriller saw its gang \u2013 all code-named after major cities and memorably clad in revolutionary-red overalls and Salvador Dal\u00ed masks \u2013 break into the Royal Mint of Spain, taking 67 people hostage and literally printing money: 2.4bn euros, to be exact. It\u2019s fair to say that the plot doesn\u2019t quite go to plan, though it does result in three raunchy romances and an island escape. Season three, an even wilder ride, proved that for this gang loyalty is as much a motivation as loot. The show\u2019s Madrid-based creator, \u00c1lex Pina, believes the latest season has the power to \u201cinfuse some oxygen into this disturbing climate \u2026 it is a brutal journey to the limit, like a ride on a vertiginous rollercoaster. I can promise the audience will not think of Covid-19 while watching it.\u201d His previous show, the women\u2019s prison drama Locked Up is, along with teen thriller Elite and the 1940s-set mystery High Seas, part of a wave of Spanish dramas that have commanded large international audiences in recent years, all in part because of Netflix. Yet Money Heist is on a different scale. Within months of arriving on the streaming service in 2017, the thriller had become the single most-watched series in countries including France, Italy, Argentina and Brazil, and its third series \u2013 released last year \u2013 was watched by 34 million households in its first week alone. Its impact has been huge: superfans send Pina photographs of tattoos of Tokyo and the Professor, and the gang\u2019s masks and overalls now rival The Handmaid\u2019s Tale bonnet for the most recognisable TV costume of recent years. They were even worn on political protests in Puerto Rico and during a real-life robbery in the French city of Nantes. In Argentina, where the show is particularly beloved, babies have been named after its protagonists. The reasons for Money Heist\u2019s appeal are obvious but also strangely ineffable, not least in episodes such as the season three opener, where characters switched between emotional extremes and glamorous locations with equally delirious speed. \u201cIt\u2019s pure rock\u2019n\u2019roll,\u201d says \u00c1lvaro Morte, who plays the gang\u2019s meticulous mastermind, the Professor. \u201cOnce you see the first chapter of the show, you are lost in it.\u201d \u201cIt has something different, especially for non-Spanish people,\u201d says his co-star \u00darsula Corber\u00f3. She stars as Tokyo, the gang member whose irrepressible desire to drink rum and dance the salsa with strangers sets a shocking series of events in motion. \u201cWe have this way of expressing ourselves, of exchanging our feelings that goes through the screen.\u201d Pina agrees that cultural specificity is one of the show\u2019s main selling points: \u201cIn Money Heist, feelings, fraternity and love are as important as the plots. A perfect heist, rational and cool, becomes something else when spiced up with Latin emotions.\u201d The tragic dynamic between the Professor and his love interest-cum-arresting officer Raquel (Itziar Itu\u00f1o) is a compelling example of this contrast in action. If there is such a thing as a quintessentially Spanish heist drama, then, this is it. It\u2019s not grittily downbeat like its British equivalents or pared-back like Scandi crime shows. Rather, says Pina, Money Heist is rooted in Spanish literature\u2019s great foundational text: \u201cTo rise up against the system is reckless and idealistic \u2013 [it\u2019s] Don Quixote! Yet I think it\u2019s much more Latin than Spanish; more passionate. In that, it differs from the English \u2018perfect heist\u2019 genre, which is cooler, more restrained, more scientific.\u201d Restraint has hardly been necessary for Pina and his writing team, since Netflix once again upped the show\u2019s budget for the new season, enabling an exciting range of high-octane stunts and ever-more lavish production values (in July, Variety estimated the previous season to be Spain\u2019s biggest-budgeted series-per-episode ever). According to Corber\u00f3, Money Heist\u2019s passionate characters can be unpredictable even for their co-creators: \u201cIf, by this time, we didn\u2019t know our characters well, it would be unforgivable,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the scriptwriters still have the ability to surprise us.\u201d Indeed, at the end of season three, the Professor experienced a trauma that \u2013 it is strongly hinted in the trailer for season four \u2013 will lead the usually rational character to behave more erratically. \u201cI think characters should always develop and evolve. If they don\u2019t, they are flat,\u201d says Morte. \u201cI used to be the kind of actor that would read a script and I\u2019d think: \u2018Oh my God! My character would never say that!\u2019 Now I\u2019ve changed my mindset. All the characters, especially the Professor, still have many things to show.\u201d Fan sites are awash with speculation on what exactly that could be. Will he seek bloody revenge on the police? Or descend into madness? There is also a political edge to the series\u2019 \u201canti-system\u201d philosophy, which is invoked whenever we hear the gang\u2019s borrowed anthem, the Italian protest song Bella Ciao. \u201cFirst and foremost, the series is meant to entertain, but an idea runs underneath,\u201d explains Pina. \u201cScepticism towards governments, central banks, the system \u2026 This notion would not sink in unless it were formulated within an entertaining narrative. The action genre used to be considered shallow and superficial, and social movies as boring. Why not put these two concepts together?\u201d Because the 2008 financial crash, which set the scene for Money Heist, was a global event, it\u2019s unsurprising that this escapist fable has resonated widely. For Morte, though, the show\u2019s impact hit home for him while he was watching the news one evening: \u201cOn the Mediterranean, an immigrants\u2019 boat was trying to reach the Spanish coast. When they were rescued, they started singing Bella Ciao. It\u2019s something that will stay with me for ever.\u201d Despite international acclaim, at the end of 2019, the UK was one of the few territories where the show did not feature in Netflix\u2019s Top 10. Latecomers would be well advised to catch up fast, though. While Pina won\u2019t set an end date, it\u2019s clear Money Heist is here for a good time, not a long time. \u201cWe\u2019re here to tell whatever we need to tell in the shortest way,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re here to shoot guns at close range, to empty magazines tirelessly \u2026 we\u2019d rather the audience switched off the TV with racing hearts than out of boredom.\u201d Money Heist: Part Four is on Netflix from Friday 3 April"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
