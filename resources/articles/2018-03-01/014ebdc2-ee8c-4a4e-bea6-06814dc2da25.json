Admittedly all the players have flitted back home at some point to reunite with their families, a luxury not permitted Ted Dexter and his team on the 1962-63 tour of the antipodes. But there may be some tired minds, if not limbs, among those English cricketers who play in both white and red-ball cricket. Back in 1962 a trip to New Zealand was regarded as a gentle holiday after the rigours of Australia, as well as a chance to restore ailing Test averages. England won all three Tests comfortably, two by an innings, against modest opposition. That has all changed. New Zealand is no longer a sinecure with victory more or less assured. A tour here is now a severe challenge; nothing is guaranteed and Joe Root knows it. Any win away from home is a minor triumph, especially for a team who have lost nine of their last 12 Tests outside England. \u201cLooking around world cricket it is very hard for any side to win away from home\u201a\u201c Root says. As a relatively new Test captain he is desperate to salvage something from this expedition. \u201cIt has been a tough winter but we have two Tests to put a different stamp on this trip and change our momentum going into the summer.\u201d Root hinted at changes in the pattern if not the personnel of England\u2019s bowling attack, with the possibility of Stuart Broad no longer being given the new ball. In fact, Root spoke more of flexibility than change; he would not guarantee that Broad would bowl first change. \u201cIt really depends on the conditions,\u201d he kept stressing. \u201cBut if we keep doing things exactly the same way we might get exactly the same results. This is one small thing that might make a difference. It might not.\u201d There is obviously one larger thing that Root believes might make a bigger difference. Ben Stokes is back and the England camp are optimistic he will be fit enough to bowl as well as bat. Root spoke about Stokes in a manner that he could never do in Australia when his key all-rounder was unavailable. Perhaps unwittingly he was explaining away the emphatic Ashes defeat, such was his glowing analysis of Stokes\u2019s contribution to his team. \u201cYou get three players with Ben and on his day probably the best three players within the side all in one. It is a huge boost to have him coming back. It gives us a really good balance,\u201d Root said. \u201cWe have to be quite careful and make sure that he is absolutely ready, and be flexible how we use him, especially in the first Test.\u201d One problem seems to be containing Stokes\u2019s eagerness upon his return. \u201cYou have to try but there\u2019s only so much you can stop him doing. He\u2019s just so excited and you don\u2019t want to take that away from him. He is such a good character around the dressing room. When he speaks about the game, he gets everyone\u2019s attention and they listen.\u201d Assuming Stokes manages to persuade everyone he is fully fit, then England will go into the Test with a long batting lineup on paper, with Chris Woakes at nine ahead of Broad and Jimmy Anderson. That would mean James Vince retaining his place at three and therefore any debate about whether Root himself should occupy that position would be shelved. Root spoke of flexibility again, although he did eventually admit that he still thinks four is his best slot. Forty-eight hours before the start, the pitch at Eden Park was well grassed. Factor in the pink ball, which everyone expects to be the fast bowler\u2019s friend, especially as darkness descends, and the temptation for a long batting lineup is obvious. The short straight boundaries should not be such a factor in a Test match but the spinners, Moeen Ali and Todd Astle, a 31-year-old leg-spinner drafted into the squad after Mitchell Santner\u2019s knee injury, will still be aware of them \u2013 assuming Astle is selected by New Zealand, who also have concerns about the fitness of Ross Taylor. He damaged a thigh in the ODI series and this has prompted the call-up of Martin Guptill as cover. Nonetheless, the New Zealanders are always optimistic now, especially at home, and this is based on the potency of their pace attack. No one argues over the greatest Kiwi fast bowler of all time (Sir Richard Hadlee) but one could have a long debate over the second best. Among the possibles would, surprisingly, be Neil Wagner (144 wickets at 27.87) and Tim Southee (208 at 31.45). Trent Boult (200 at 28.56) is probably the strongest candidate of a trio who will all be in action at Eden Park. Wagner has a county championship winner\u2019s medal after his season at Essex last year and he recalled his summer alongside Alastair Cook. \u201cHe\u2019s a great lad, loved spending time with him. We\u2019ve already had some banter about this series, so I look forward to playing against him. It will be quite an interesting battle, then we can sit down, have a laugh and talk about it.\u201d The contest will be fierce enough but, no, this is not the Ashes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
