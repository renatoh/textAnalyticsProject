The make-up of Group A, which even overshadowed the pairing of Manchester United and Celtic in Group F, was made more daunting by the presence of Werder Bremen, a potent force in the Bundesliga and spearheaded by the leading scorer at the World Cup, Miroslav Klose. Their threat will ensure neither Chelsea nor Barcelona will be able to relax in their potentially combustible clashes in October. The Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon admitted there was a sense of inevitability about the outcome to yesterday's draw. Mourinho and Frank Rijkaard have gone head to head in the last two seasons, the Portuguese enraging both Bar&amp;ccedila and Uefa after the first meeting by claiming he had seen his opposite number visit the referee Anders Frisk's dressing room at half-time in the first tie which the Catalans won 2-1. The charge was never proved but, although Mourinho served a touchline ban after the official received death threats, Chelsea prevailed 4-2 at Stamford Bridge. Yet there was revenge for Barcelona last term with Asier del Horno sent off, and Mourinho incensed by Lionel Messi's perceived theatrics, as the visitors won 2-1 in west London. \"We've got to move on from what's happened in the past,\" insisted Kenyon. \"But it was almost to be expected. At least we're meeting them early in the competition, but we must not overlook some of the other teams in there.\" Werder, who visit Chelsea in the opening round of games, pose an awkward threat with Levski Sofia - the first Bulgarian club to reach the group stage - a less onerous task. United's chief executive David Gill spoke of \"gaining revenge\" after being drawn against Benfica, whose victory at the Estadio da Luz last term ensured Sir Alex Ferguson's side ended bottom of their group. \"After last year, I have a bit of thirst about the Champions League,\" said Ferguson, with the prospect of a first ever competitive meeting with Celtic, at Old Trafford on September 12, no doubt catching his eye. \"United are the outstanding favourites, and there will be a battle between the other teams for second place,\" admitted Gordon Strachan, who has endured a feisty relationship with Ferguson since playing under him at Aberdeen. \"But, when I looked at some of the other groups, I am happy to have avoided them. We are not at our best just now, and I wouldn't tip us to get to the second phase, but we hope to get better.\" Debutants FC Copenhagen, fresh from qualifying success over Ajax, and Benfica, conquerors of Liverpool as well as United last term, make up a group from which United would expect to emerge, with Celtic optimistic of doing likewise. Liverpool will return to Istanbul, where they won this competition in 2005, to face Galatasaray and may come up against their European Cup winner Vladimir Smicer, now of Bordeaux. Their other group opponents, PSV Eindhoven, are now managed by Ronald Koeman whose Benfica team defeated the Merseysiders in the knock-out stage last term. Arsenal will be confident of progressing from Group G, despite the presence of the 2004 winners Porto, as they attempt to make amends for defeat in last season's final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
