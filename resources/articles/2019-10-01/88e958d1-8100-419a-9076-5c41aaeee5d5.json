There were a few tackles flying in but you expect that in these games. I\u2019m fine \u2013 he caught me in the head but I didn\u2019t get knocked out unfortunately \u2026 fortunately, sorry! We showed character to come from behind and it\u2019s a good result against a great team. So, Wales earn an honourable draw against Croatia in a bruising game of few chances. Gareth Bale scored a masterful equaliser just before half-time after an early goal from Nikola Vlasic; and though Bale\u2019s goal should have been ruled out for a foul by Ben Davies in the build-up, Wales deserved their draw on the balance of play. The result means Wales should - should - qualify if they win their last two group matches against Azerbaijan (A) and Hungary (H). But it is, for the first time, out of their hands. If Slovakia win their last two matches, at home to Azerbaijan and away to Croatia, Wales will be out. Peep peep! 90+8 min Vlasic grossly overhits a through pass to Perisic. Had he weighted it correctly, Perisic would have been clear on goal. In his defence, the angles meant there was almost no margin for error. 90+6 min James is booked, a little harshly, for an aerial challenge on Jedvaj. 90+5 min One thing in Wales\u2019 favour is that Croatia play their last group game before Hungary - in other words, they will need a point at home to Slovakia to be certain of qualification. And if they get that, Wales will qualify if they win away to Azerbaijan and at home to Hungary. They\u2019dve took it. 90+4 min Croatia have completely dominated possession for the last 20 minutes, though their domination has been entirely sterile. In fact, I don\u2019t think Wayne Hennessey has made a save since Perisic\u2019s header in the 13th minute. 90+2 min Bale can barely move. He\u2019s still on the pitch, but all he can really do is hop. It\u2019s been a bruising game for both teams. 90 min The injured Modric is replaced by Milan Badelj. There will be eight minutes of added time. Bale is also limping heavily; Wales have used all their subs. 88 min Connor Roberts has a close-range shot blocked by Jedvaj. The chance came after an exhilarating run from Wilson, who was then flattened by Modric. The ball ran through to Tyler Roberts, who in turn picked out Connor Roberts. Modric is booked; both he and Wilson are still down. 86 min Kieffer Moore, who worked very hard without much reward, is replaced by Tyler Roberts. 86 min Allen is booked for a kick at Brekalo, who was leading a Croatia break. That means he\u2019ll miss next month\u2019s match in Azerbaijan. 85 min Rakitic is booked for a late lunge at Wilson. 84 min It increasingly looks like both teams have settled for a draw; or, at least, that they aren\u2019t willing to take any risks in pursuit of victory. 83 min James makes good ground down the left, only to slice his cross out of play. The Wales attackers look tired. 80 min Wales need to be careful as Croatia are starting to pin them back. It\u2019s harmless possession at the moment, at least. 77 min Croatia have had more of the ball in the last five minutes. It\u2019s so delicately poised, and neither side knows whether to stick or twist. A draw is a decent enough result for both; a win would be pure gold. 75 min \u201cNo shame in Williams\u2019 performance,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cWhen it comes to Wales, no one but Ramsey is truly \u2018Ramseyish.\u2019 Otherwise, 2016 would have been even better.\u201d 73 min A draw would be a pretty good result for Wales. If it stays like this, they will qualify if they win their last two games unless Slovakia are victorious away to Croatia. 72 min Jedvaj, teed up by Rebic 20 yards from goal, spins a sweet shot with the outside of the right foot that drifts a few yards wide. Hennessexy had it covered. 70 min Perisic is lucky not to be booked for a foul on the breaking Wilson. 68 min Another Wales change: Harry Wilson replaces Jonny Williams, who did some nice things without quite having a Ramseyish influence. 68 min \u201cI know the Guardian does not encourage violence to either fish or full-back,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cBut just in case memories of Joe Jordan have faded here\u2019s a refresher.\u201d 67 min Apart from the first 15 minutes, Wales have been the equal of the World Cup finalists. There\u2019s merit in that, for all the frustration over Giggs\u2019s tactics. 66 min \u201cJust curious,\u201d says Bob Kenyon. \u201cDo you take the time to make every mention of Wales a link to a webpage, or does it happen by magic?\u201d The latter. In fact, I had no idea it happened. 65 min After a fine move from Croatia, Perisic\u2019s dangerous cutback is crucially cleared by Roberts. 64 min If Croatia draw tonight, they will need a draw in their final game at home to Slovakia to be sure of qualifying. It\u2019s a bit too close for comfort. 63 min Croatia make another change, with Ante Rebic replacing Bruno Petkovic. 61 min Bale goes on a scintillating run, beating Rakitic, Modric and Barisic before losing his balance just inside the area. There was a slight touch from Barisic, though Bale stayed on his feet and the only penalty appeals came from the crowd. 61 min This is anyone\u2019s game. Wales have played with greater snap since half-time. Ethan Ampadu, meanwhile, has just returned to the Wales bench after being assessed by the medical staff. 59 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI feel a bit for Wales (and both Irish teams), what with their realistic prospects of qualification. There\u2019s a lot to be said for the Scottish method of total inadequacy, punctuated by the odd shellacking of a part-time pub team, with no chance of qualification, and therefore no resulting disappointment. The Manchester United of international football, if you will.\u201d That\u2019s a bit harsh on Chelsea. 58 min Moore is booked for a high tackle on Lovren. 57 min Perisic\u2019s dangerous cross from the right hits the arm of Jedvaj. Kuipers awards a free-kick to Wales, which is a relief to those with memories of Joe Jordan. 55 min Wales are having a fine spell. James runs at Lovren on the left side of the box, shifts the ball down the line and cracks a shot from a tight angle that is blocked by Livakovic. He couldn\u2019t hold it but there were no Wales players around to take advantage. 53 min \u201cFor a man who only played under Alex Ferguson at club level, it\u2019s odd that the main feature of Giggs\u2019 team is players looking to pass sideways or backwards at the first opportunity,\u201d says Jonny Bull. \u201cWales thrived under Speed and Coleman, who set the team up to emphasise their strengths. The flashes of quality this team shows seem to come when they don\u2019t follow the plan.\u201d It\u2019s odd \u2013 I would have bet my dignity on a Giggs team playing with aggression and high tempo. 51 min I forgot to say, because of that Ampadu injury, that Ivan Rakitic replaced the injured Mateo Kovacic at half-time. 50 min \u201cWell,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cIf there\u2019s going to be controversy, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d rather the moral ambiguity of a foul-not-given over Lawrence potentially coming on and making a difference.\u201d 49 min Ampadu is helped from the field, not on a stretcher, and Morrell replaces him. 48 min Ampadu is still down, and a stretcher is being brought onto the pitch. Lincoln\u2019s Joe Morrell is getting ready to replace him. I\u2019m not sure whether Ampadu was injured by the contact with Petkovic of the landing. 46 min Petkovic is booked after 15 seconds of the second half for flattening Ampadu as the pair jumped for a high ball. That three-touch finish from Bale gets better every time you see it. His touch and awareness in such a tight space - and under such pressure - were so classy. It was definitely a foul by Davies in the build-up; he got the ball, but came through Kovacic to get it. Half-time reading \u201cFail to see how not pressing the opposition at all in their half when you basically need to win is a good idea, especially when they are leaving Modric free rein,\u201d says Nick Goolding. \u201cGreat equaliser though - looked like Ben Davies didn\u2019t get the memo and went on a rampage.\u201d Peep peep! Gareth Bale\u2019s superb - and controversial - injury-time equaliser has changed the mood in Cardiff. Croatia were comfortable through the first half, and deservedly led through Nikola Vlasic\u2019s early goal. 45+6 min Croatia finally kick off. Kovacic has limped off in a manner which suggests we won\u2019t see him for the second half. 45+5 min Lovren has been booked for dissent. Croatia still haven\u2019t kicked off because of the Kovacic injury. 45+5 min Kovacic is still down, having been clattered by Davies in the build up. Davies charged forward from the halfway line and slid the ball towards Bale on the edge of the box. He couldn\u2019t control it, but Davies won the loose ball with a very strong - and probably illegal - tackle on Kovacic 30 yards from goal. Then he got his head up and slid a fine angled pass to Bale just inside the box, to the left of centre. He controlled it deftly on the run, moved it away from Lovren and slid a precise low shot across Livakovic. That was classily taken by Bale, because he had very little space in which to work. All three touches were immaculate. Superb goal! Croatia will be fuming but it was beautifully taken. 45 min There will be four minutes of added time. 44 min Modric, for the umpteen hundredth time in his career, has had the most touches of anyone on the field. It\u2019s his game; the other 21 just play in it. 42 min Wales need more from James and especially Bale, who looks nowhere near his awesome best. 37 min Petkovic wins a ... goalkick for Wales. That should have been a corner. 35 min Although Wales are playing better, they can\u2019t lay a glove on the Croatia defence. Kieffer Moore, who had such a fine full debut against Slovakia, hasn\u2019t seen much of the ball tonight. 33 min \u201cHey Rob,\u201d says J.R. in Illinois. \u201cI\u2019ll preface this by saying I\u2019m not a doctor but there is no way Daniel James should be playing right now and there\u2019s no way he was adequately tested for a concussion in a couple minutes on the pitch. He was unconscious. Here in the U.S. the announcer, Taylor Twellman, who knows a thing or two about concussions, said the decision to let James keep playing was \u2018disgusting\u2019 and I agree with him. European football is for some reason lagging behind on this issue.\u201d I don\u2019t know enough \u2013 about concussions, never mind this specific incident \u2013 to comment. It\u2019s so easy to say it\u2019s disgusting, etc, etc, and I don\u2019t doubt there have been examples of players being allowed back on the field when they should not have been. But I suspect there have been many more examples of decent, experienced medical professionals being abused without just cause. 30 min There\u2019s a break in play because of a pitch invasion. The gentleman in question, his trousers so low that all concerned can appreciate his red underpants with white band, is now being bundled off the field. You 29 min A quiet period in the game. It\u2019s a more even contest now, though Wales have yet to create a serious chance. 26 min Kovacic plays a nice short pass to Perisic, who is in the act of shooting when Davies comes on the blindside to make a vital interception. 22 min Davies wins a corner for Wales, who have come to life since James was flattened by Vida. Nothing comes of it but the last five minutes have been much more encouraging. 21 min \u201cAm I the only one who thinks that a team in red shouldn\u2019t be allowed to play a team in black?\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cThere\u2019s contrast with the numbers and the trim, sure, but at first glance it\u2019s not great. Oh, and as an Everton fan, the lack of playing time that Vlasic got, and then his quick loan and sale, leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\u201d It can\u2019t be much fun being the taste buds of an Everton fan. 20 min Bale rams his free-kick into the wall, flattening Petkoric in the process. The referee stops plays so that he can receive treatment. 19 min Modric is adjudged to have fouled Moore, 25 yards from goal. It looked soft, but Wales won\u2019t care if Bale roofs one from here. 18 min \u201cYou (quite understandably) didn\u2019t mention the League of Nations or Nations League or whatever it is playoff route to Euro 2020 in your preamble, but I think if Denmark qualify then Wales would be in the playoffs even if they finish 4th in their group,\u201d says Phil Grey. \u201cI could be wrong. I could be right.\u201d 16 min James gets to his feet, looking very groggy. He\u2019s going to continue, so I assume he has passed a concussion test. 15 min Vida is pretty lucky to get way with a yellow card. It was a flying knee in the head, basically, as James shaped to control a high ball. James is still being treated, though he is conscious. The immediate reaction from the Croatia players was really worrying. 14 min A horrible collision between James and Vida near the halfway line. This looks really nasty, and the physios were onto the field even before the referee had stopped play. One of the Croatia players was also frantically waving them on as he ran straight towards James. Vida has been booked, and James is still down receiving treatment. 13 min: Excellent save from Hennessey! Croatia are playing superbly. Petkovic, on the left wing, swings a long cross/pass over the Wales defence to find Perisic near the penalty spot. He flicks a header towards the bottom corner, and Hennessey scrambles to his left to push it round the post. I thought that was going to sneak in. 12 min If Wales lose tonight, they will only qualify if they win their last two games and Croatia win their final match at home to Slovakia. Not at all beyond the realms, although Croatia will already have qualified if they win this match. 11 min Bale cuts infield and hits a shot that is comfortably saved by Livakovic. A dreadful start for Wales. Brekalo surged down the left before moving infield, away from Lockyer. He pushed the ball back to Petkovic, who in turn teed up Vlasic on the edge of the box. His low shot, though not especially well struck, was precise enough to beat the diving Hennessey and go into the net off the post. One-nil! 8 min Wales appeal for a penalty when Lovren shoulder barges the charging James off the field. It was a risky challenge, that - probably not enough for a penalty, but it was close. 8 min Croatia continue to dominate, though everything has been in front of the Wales defence. 6 min A long ball is headed down by Petkovic to Brekalo, who slashes the bouncing ball well wide from 20 yards. 4 min It\u2019s been a confident, authoritative start from Croatia, with the first few minutes taking place almost exclusively in the Wales half. 1 min Peep peep! Croatia, in their dark blue and black away strip, kick off from right to left. Wales are in red. There\u2019s a storming atmosphere in Cardiff, as you\u2019d expect. The captains Gareth Bale and Luka Modric, team-mates for most of the last 11 years, embrace in the centre circle. \u201cPlease knock off the anti-Welsh stuff,\u201d says David Crouch. \u201cWelsh is not the language of animals.\u201d Unsubscribe. \u201cReit, mae\u2019r bechgyn rygbi wedi gwneud eu gwaith,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cNawr, dyma dro\u2019r bechgyn p\u00eal-droed.\u201d Funnily enough I just said exactly the same thing to my dog, P\u00eal-droed. Italy and Russia have qualified for Euro 2020. They join Belgium, who were the first team to confirm their place at next summer\u2019s jamboree. Hungary 1-0 Azerbaijan is the final score in Budapest. It seems Bahlul Mustafazade had an injury-time equaliser dubiously ruled out for handball. It doesn\u2019t change Wales\u2019 task, as they would have budgeted for a Hungary win, but it would have been a lovely boost going into the Croatia game. I\u2019m still trying to find out what happened in the Hungary match, but the official Uefa site briefly said it was 1-1. Hang on, it\u2019s been ruled out! Azerbaijan have scored an injury-time in equaliser in Hungary! That\u2019s a huge boost for Wales. Pre-match reading Wales are unchanged. Croatia are without Marcelo Brozovic, who is suspended, while Ivan Rakitic and Ante Rebic drop to the bench. Wales (4-2-3-1) Hennessey; Roberts, Rodon, Lockyer, Davies; Allen, Ampadu; Bale, J Williams, James; Moore. Substitutes: Ward, Davies, Gunter, N Taylor, A Williams, Roberts, Vokes, Wilson, Morrell, Lawrence, Matondo, Vaulks. Croatia (4-2-3-1) Livakovic; Jedvaj, Lovren, Vida, Barisic; Modric, Kovacic; Perisic, Vlasic, Brekalo; Petkovic. Substitutes: Kalinic, Sluga, Melnjak, Peric, Rakitic, Orsic, Bradaric, Skoric, Pasalic, Rebic, Badelj, Bartolec. Referee Bjorn Kuipers (Netherlands). Hello. Three games, then. Three games for Wales to qualify for another European Championship: Croatia at home tonight, then Azerbaijan (A) and Hungary (H) next month. If they win the lot they will be at Euro 2020, although there\u2019s a credible scenario whereby two wins is enough. It\u2019s all pretty complicated, but in essence a draw tonight would be a very good result for Wales, never mind a win, and even defeat would not completely crush the dreams of small children who were too young for Euro 2016 and dream of seeing their side at a major tournament. Although Wales are playing the World Cup finalists, and are without the injured Aaron Ramsey, they will quietly fancy their chances tonight. Their home record under Ryan Giggs is pretty solid, even if the performances haven\u2019t always been convincing, while Croatia\u2019s away form in this group hasn\u2019t been great. They hammered Slovakia 4-0, sure, bring that up if you must, but they also lost in Hungary and drew in Azerbaijan. Those results mean they can\u2019t take anything for granted in this group. A win tonight would ensure qualification for Euro 2020; a defeat would leave them vulnerable to a potential sting when they host Slovakia in their final game. Kick off is at 7.45pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
