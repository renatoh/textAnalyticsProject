Union officials said staff felt \"angry and betrayed\" after the closures were announced as part of a wider restructuring of the Co-operative Insurance Society which is expected to cost 2,500 jobs in total. David McCall at the Transport &amp; General Workers Union said the union would oppose compulsory redundancies and would play a robust role in consultation expected before the closures at the end of 2005. The CIS said up to 350 of the roles could be transferred to its central functions in Manchester. The offices were set up to administer the work of its 3,000 financial advisers but had started to operate almost as branches or \"customer contact points\". Unlike most rivals, the CIS is keeping its direct sales force, which sells insurance door-to-door, a move welcomed by the unions yesterday. Mervyn Pedelty, chief executive of Cooperative Financial Services, said the \"difficult decision\" about job losses had not been taken lightly. He promised to minimise the need for redundancies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
