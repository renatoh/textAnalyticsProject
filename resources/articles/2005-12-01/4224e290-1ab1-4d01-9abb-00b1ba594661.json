A meeting today between unions and management ended in acrimony after ITV refused to increase their offer of an annual wage rise of 2.5%. The National Union of Journalists, Amicus and Bectu subsequently called for an official dispute and said a ballot for industrial action will begin on January 10. NUJ official Paul McLaughlin said: \"The offer of 2.5% across the board is unacceptable to the members across ITV. \"We are now in dispute with ITV. We've asked for a further meeting at which we would expect management to increase and improve their offer. In the absence of that we'll be moved to ballot on January 10. \"Our members are very determined. When they see the ITV board splash out \u00a3175m on a website [Friends Reunited] they expect to receive proper pay increases.\" It is understood that to bolster the 2.5% pay increase above inflation, ITV has offered staff shares. If industrial action does go ahead it would hit shows across ITV. Programmes that might be affected include celebrity singing contest Soapstar Superstar and celebrity ice-skating show Dancing On Ice. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
