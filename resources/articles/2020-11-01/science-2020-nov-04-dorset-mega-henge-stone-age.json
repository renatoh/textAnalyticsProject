A study of the Mount Pleasant \u201cmega henge\u201d, a sprawling site near Dorchester, has found it was not constructed over centuries as had previously been thought but in as little as 35 years. The finding has led researchers from Cardiff University to put forward the theory that a frantic building programme was under way in southern Britain in around 2,500BC, just before people arrived from what is now mainland Europe with other belief systems, ways of life and materials. The lead researcher, Susan Greaney of the university\u2019s school of history, archaeology and religion, said: \u201cThe picture emerging is an explosion in building activity with large and labour-intensive monuments being constructed across southern England, and perhaps further afield. \u201cThe building of Mount Pleasant would have involved a huge number of people \u2013 digging out the enormous ditches with simple tools like antler picks. This was right at the end of the stone age, just before people came from the continent with metal goods, new types of pottery, new styles of burial and so on. \u201cYou could look at it as the last hurrah of the stone age. They could see the changes coming and decide to resist them \u2013 they may have been thinking: \u2018We don\u2019t need these changes. We\u2019ll build bigger and better monuments to our gods. We\u2019ll knuckle down and stick with what we know\u2019.\u201d Mount Pleasant included a henge \u2013 a circular enclosure surrounded by bank and ditch \u2013 and a palisade, a fence made of huge tree trunks. It is huge \u2013 the size of nine football pitches \u2013 and one of five known mega-henges in southern England from around the same period. Others include Durrington Walls and Avebury in Wiltshire. The stone circle of Stonehenge was also built at about the same time. The henges are believed to be significant ceremonial sites where people probably gathered for feasting and rituals, sometimes travelling over long distances to get there. Mount Pleasant, the site of which is now ploughed fields, was excavated in the early 1970s by archaeologists who found items including antler picks, pieces of charcoal and human bone. As part of the new research some of these items, which are held at the Dorset County Museum, were dated using techniques not available 50 years ago. The conclusion was the bulk of the site was constructed in between 35 and 125 years. Greaney said the \u201clast hurrah\u201d was just one theory. \u201cIt may also be that the effort of building these monuments led to a rebellion or a collapse in belief that created a vacuum that allowed people to come in from the continent.\u201d She pointed out that part of a central stone monument appears to have been broken. \u201cWas it destroyed during a time of unrest?\u201d Peter Marshall, of Historic England, said: \u201cThis research shows the importance of archaeological collections stored in museums. Even though the site was excavated 50 years ago, it has been possible to use utilise new scientific techniques to examine the material held in Dorchester. \u201cAs archaeological practices evolve, the value of these museum collections and the importance of their long-term preservation cannot be underestimated.\u201d The research has been published in the Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society journal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
