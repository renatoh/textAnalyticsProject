Doorman Graeme Lawson said a group of Asians were taunting Woodgate's friend James Hewison - who had just been ejected from the Majestyk nightclub in Leeds for drunken behaviour - when Mr Hewison went to confront them. Mr Lawson told Hull Crown Court that Mr Hewison had \"squared up\" to the group, which the trial has been told included attack victim Sarfraz Najeib, before one of them punched Mr Hewison in the face. He said: \"After a slight pause, the group realised what had happened and the Asians started running off. The lad who had punched Mr Woodgate's friend started bouncing around like Prince Naseem, thinking he was going to do it again,\" said Mr Lawson. \"But when his friends ran off, he followed them.\" The trial of Woodgate, team-mate Lee Bowyer and two other men charged with assualting 21-year-old student Mr Najeib has heard that a chase followed the confrontation, ending with the victim being attacked in nearby Mill Hill. Witnesses have described Mr Najeib being involved in an exchange of blows outside the nightclub before he and his friends were chased across City Square and into Mill Hill. Earlier a paramedic called to the scene in Mill Hill, where Mr Najeib was left with a broken leg, cheekbone and facial injuries, told how he found the victim conscious but unable to speak. Ambulance technician Andrew Finn said there was blood around the student's head and blood trapped in his airway. \"He was conscious but was unable to respond to any questions. He had a head injury and I could hear blood in his airway. He was moaning but not moving greatly.\" He told the jury that one of two men who directed his ambulance to the scene was Leeds United reserve team striker Tony Hackworth, whom he described as \"excitable\". He said Hackworth's shirt was open to the navel, but was not sure if it had been ripped or was simply unbuttoned. He added that Hackworth said there had been a fight between some Asian and white youths and that he had tried to help. The trial was adjourned until Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
