It doesn't add \"you'll never leave\", but sometimes it must feel like that for the Milk. Four mates who've known each other since primary school (\"Earlier than that,\" quips drummer Mitch, motioning at bassist Luke, \"he's my brother!\"), they've made music together since \"geeking out\" on Oasis tunes in a shed at 13, survived three years as the Blank Faced Babies (\"Go up the M1 in a Fiesta with a snare drum on your lap, play to no one, get totally pissed and end up camping on a roundabout,\" is how guitarist Dan remembers it), and carved a reputation in the epicentre of the Towie triangle as what singer-guitarist Rick calls, \"The grungers, just cos we didn't have Kappa tracksuits and cropped hair.\" Asked if there's anything to do here, the band gesture to the Red Chilli curry house, which proudly but forlornly displays its 3 Out Of 5 hygiene rating (predecessor the Samrat was closed down entirely but holds a special place in Milk mythology, of which more later). They bemoan how Adrian's Records, where Prodigy's Liam Howlett would buy his jungle vinyl is now a Costa, and opt eventually to take the Guide to Plazma. It's lit like a Travelodge, plays host to 2 Shoes at the weekend, and turns into \"the Wickford rave\" after dark. \"The other pub, you'd just get beaten up,\" claims Luke. Still, this experience of the Essex you don't see on ITV2 has been poured into a frisky cocktail of subversive soul-pop on debut album Tales From The Thames Delta, mixed into one seamless set by their mate Brad Baloo of the Nextmen. \"We wanted to make a response to Spotify culture,\" explains Rick. \"The best recent example being the Janelle Mon\u00e1e record which came with a fuck-off booklet explaining her whole fictional world.\" \"Our concept was a day in the life of a lad in Essex,\" says Mitch. \"Starting with a phone call, cos the first thing you want to do is round here is score some weed.\" So here's the local colour behind their best songs \u2026 B-Roads \"Citibank pulled a gun on me/ I never paid for my C2C/ And I'm known to a biker gang/ As the next neck they're gonna hang\" Reading this on mobile?

They drink down the pub that we still have to frequent. And hopefully they ain't there today!\" Rick: \"But we know these people. We're not voyeurs. We know their names; they'll say hello.\" Hometown \"My hometown, with the villains and the thieves/ Gangsta wanna wannabes\" Rick: \"The most frustrating thing about living here is that it's depressingly shit but it's not gangland; there would almost be a badge of honour if we lived in a ghetto but it's nothing like that. It's just full of people who are up to no good.\" Mitch: \"Big fish in a small pond, innit?\" Every Time We Fight \"Kids' faces covered/ They're hurting one another/ Good luck avoiding the beating down\" Reading this on mobile?

But that song was written when the riots happened and for us the best thing that about the riots was the morning after when it got people out of bed to clean up together.\" Luke: \"The video [directed by and starring The Inbetweeners' James Buckley] was all James's idea.\" Rick: \"We were adamant that we didn't want to portray the riots at all. So James's video was all shot in one day; the bar opened at 11, and we were there till midnight. By the scenes at the end we're all fucking ruined! The band is two of our dads. Having us turning up playing in a working men's club would have been a bit tryhard. At least if our dads are doing it it's funny.\" Lay The Pain On Me \"Are we the fire or have we just jumped out of the pan?/ When the chips are all stacked I know you've got my back\" Rick: \"We were knackered, doing gigs then going to work. So we said, 'Should we not just give up work, live with our parents and have a year where there's no regrets?'\" Luke: \"We all handed in our notices at the same time.\" Rick: \"Then 12 months later we still didn't have a deal! We sat at the piano and wrote about our situation \u2013 it's our song of the unemployed, desperate young man with ambition.\" Mitch: \"Remember we said we weren't moaners?\" Dan: \"But if you're going to, leave it till track 11, eh?\".
