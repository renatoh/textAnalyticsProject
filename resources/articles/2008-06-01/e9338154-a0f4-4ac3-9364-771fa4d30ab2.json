Fittingly for the visit of an unpopular president winding up his term of office, Romans were more concerned at the idea of blocked streets and blocked cell phone signals so soon after a slew of world leaders descended on them for the UN food summit held in Rome last week. Protesters planning to march against the US presence in Iraq were on the streets as early as Monday, camped outside the city's Regina Coeli jail in prisoner's garb after hearing that 230 inmates were being moved out to make room for any protesters arrested. Police being drafted in to handle security on the streets were not much happier, with one spokesman complaining that the food laid on for officers during Bush's last visit a year ago was terrible, including \"rubber sandwiches\". Perhaps the two men in Rome happiest to see Bush will be the prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, who will dine with Bush today, and Pope Benedict XVI, who will meet the president on Friday. Berlusconi will reportedly highlight Italy's intention to make its soldiers in Afghanistan more rapidly deployable against the Taliban, hoping in turn to win Bush's support for a greater Italian role in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear ambitions. Pope Benedict will be rolling out the red carpet at the Vatican to thank Bush for picking him up personally from the airport when he visited the US in April. But instead of receiving Bush in the papal apartments at the Vatican as protocol requires, Benedict will walk the outgoing US president round the Vatican gardens and sit down with him in the tower of St John, which stands in the gardens."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
