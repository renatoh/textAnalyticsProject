Or, to put it another way, because this is where we are leading, is Andrew Strauss currently the best Test match opener on the planet? Of course there is Graeme Smith, Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag and so forth and there are batsmen who average more than he does. But right now, as the world's leading run-scorer this year, is there anyone you would rely on more at the top of the order to get an innings off to a solid start? Not for me there is not \u2013 which, given that it is little more than 18 months since he was batting for his international future in a Test match in Napier, says much for the impression he has made in that time. His has been a greasy pole career: the remarkable run-glut of a start, where it appeared as if the opposition might just as well have given him a hundred and told him to piss off to the dressing room; the depressing middle period where his weaknesses were twigged and exploited; and now the renaissance, sending him not just back to where he was but soaring way above that technically and mentally. Sky produced a table during the third Test that showed that his total of 18 centuries in 65 Tests stands comparison with the batting giants of the game at the same stage. His name looked incongruous slotted in there (more than Sir Isaac Vivian Alexander Richards for goodness sake) but it just shows that achievement comes in different forms. Only Geoff Boycott (22), Graham Gooch (20) and Sir Leonard Hutton (19) have scored more hundreds for England as an opener but the first two played 108 and 118 matches respectively, with 79 from Hutton, and surely he will outstrip them, perhaps even in the next year. This week it emerged that because of an internecine spat, the last of England's four Tests in South Africa this winter could well be shifted from The Wanderers to Port Elizabeth, which to me brought a reminder of England's last Test there and a snapshot of the early Strauss. At the time he was standing out as the bright star in a match played at such a mediocre standard it appeared as if the sides were vying for some sort of booby prize. Strauss held things together for England, making 126 and 94 not out, and at one point, out of the blue, he hit a pace bowler past the stumps, just to the onside of straight and to the boundary. At that stage of his career the area between extra cover and midwicket might just as well have not existed \u2013 an exclusion zone, so rarely did he visit it. So this was a collector's item. We needed to study the replay just to make sure he had not been working to midwicket and got a meaty leading edge instead. In those days he cut and chopped, pulled, collected for a rainy day on the leg-side and punched the odd drive wide of cover's right hand. And bowlers, having seen him but rarely, pandered to it. It was in Australia three winters ago, on the Tour That Dare Not Be Spoken Of, that he was neutered by clever planning and brilliant execution. Oddly, leading into the Test series, he had pummelled the boundary boards much more frequently than normal. It was slightly disconcerting, a bit hyperactive. What followed was chastening. In the first Test at The Gabba he made 12 and 11, mis-hooking Glenn McGrath's bouncer to square-leg in the first innings and then helping another bouncer, from Stuart Clark, to long-leg 10 yards in from the boundary in the second. What followed was superb. While Strauss must have waited for the next four matches for the short balls to exploit this apparent weakness, none arrived, not one \u2013 a distraction in itself. Instead the seamers probed away, full and on off-stump, knowing that he had nowhere to go, and that eventually to make progress he must revert to something he knew. There were some rough decisions but essentially he had been played out of the series. Now came the strength of character. Knowing your weakness is one thing but having the singlemindedness and dedication to do something about it is quite another. Strauss was omitted from the touring party to Sri Lanka in 2007 and, out of the limelight, worked specifically on developing a straighter game, gaining a passport to the land beyond the bowler. With that in his armoury he has become, if not the complete player, then one with all the tools he requires to flourish against all bowling in all conditions: he still cuts and pulls and he still nurdles his cackhander's bread-and-butter runs on the leg-side. He can still punch through the covers, too. But tellingly, when bowlers overpitch on his off stump or straighter, he just offers the full face and drills it back past them. It is a revelation \u2013 so simple but effective. No greater acknowledgment of this has come than in Birmingham when Ricky Ponting posted for him one of those fashionable short mid-offs almost standing on the cut strip. Three years ago such a fielder could have taken a deck chair and novel with him and been untroubled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
