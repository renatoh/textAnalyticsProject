But the best teams do not always win the World Cup.\" Germany might, then, and after seven days of stinging criticism from former team-mates back home, unconvinced by the team's unspectacular progress to today's quarter-final with the United States, another grilling was all V\u00f6ller needed. The 42-year-old, usually more like a Monaco playboy than a stern German, lost his cool in the wake of his team's scrappy 1-0 dismissal of Paraguay. Yesterday he bit his lip; today he hopes to prove the critics wrong. \"I always try to keep everything under control but I'm only a simple human being,\" said V\u00f6ller, whose international career included three World Cup finals appearances and a phenomenal 47 goals in 90 games. \"When I took this job two years ago I vowed to stand by the team and protect them. I'll continue to do that. But Franz Beckenbauer warned me that I shouldn't lose my temper, particularly when people were criticising, and instead I should keep my focus on coaching. I'm trying.\" Outbursts are rare. His knee-jerk reaction - \"People should know when to shut up,\" he had barked in response to comments made by the former international Thomas Berthold - was more reminiscent of the bubble-permed striker whose ugly spat with Frank Rijkaard in Italia 90 ignited a second-round grudge match against Holland. \"Three weeks of being surrounded by the media got to me,\" he explained. \"I'm calmer now.\" Despite the display against Paraguay, the criticism did seem harsh. V\u00f6ller inherited a side at its lowest ebb for half a century. Erich Ribbeck's team had been eliminated from Euro 2000 with no points from three games. The holders had been humiliated, with the caretaker's job - to restore wrecked pride - hampered by an ageing squad racked by internal strife. Their 1-0 victory at Wembley in the World Cup qualifiers papered over cracks which were then ripped wide open by the 5-1 drubbing in Munich last September, Germany's worst home defeat in 70 years. V\u00f6ller's father suffered a heart attack as Michael Owen's hat-trick flew beyond a bewildered Oliver Kahn. Having sunk to a personal nadir, V\u00f6ller offered to resign. But he was persuaded to stay and the Germans, via a 5-2 aggregate play-off win over Ukraine, qualified. \"The pressure we had to bear was enormous and the fact that we coped with it brought the players closer together,\" he said. \"I think it made us much stronger. As it is, I have never seen such a good atmosphere within a squad in my entire career. We socialise together; after the Ireland game we might have been down [after conceding a late equaliser] but instead we all went out for dinner and nobody wanted to leave. With that team spirit and collective effort, we can beat any side.\" \"We all stand together and share the same dream,\" echoed Kahn, captaining the side after kicking his heels on the bench in the previous two World Cups. \"Many of the players were at Euro 2000 and came here eager to show that it was not the real Germany then. There are also several players who will never play at a World Cup again and want to make the most of it. That's a great motivation to have. \"What we lack in flair we make up for in self-belief and spirit. Spirit can carry you a long way in a tournament and this squad is very strong. Beating Saudi Arabia so convincingly gave us the confidence which has just carried us through.\" That 8-0 walloping also served to pep deflated expectations. After their precarious qualification few dared to anticipate much. With that in mind, V\u00f6ller has achieved something of a minor miracle by ensuring Germany reached the last eight for the 13th successive tournament, a sequence stretching back to 1954. Now, with appetites whetted at home, further progress is demanded. Even the chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der predicts a 2-0 win over the US, \"though I don't want to join the ranks of the millions who are second-guessing the German manager\". The US cannot hope to, either. V\u00f6ller may have been a novice coach but he has steadily proved himself tactically adept. He ignored suggestions that the inexperienced Miroslav Klose might not be ready to lead the forward line, and now the Kaiserslautern striker is the joint leading scorer with five and has been valued at \u00a325m by his club. Against Paraguay V\u00f6ller switched his defence at half-time and perked up a shabby display, resulting in Oliver Neuville's blistering winner two minutes from time. The Bayer Leverkusen forward may today be preferred to Carsten Jancker. Despite the injuries that afflicted his squad on the eve of the finals, V\u00f6ller has conjured up options. \"We are now in a position where we can reach the last four,\" said the coach, who will remain at the helm until 2006 at least. \"Few would have believed that possible two years ago, but that was our goal and now it's a dream which we can realise. You can see in training that the team are up for the match and that we have a real chance. It would be fatal if we let that chance pass us by.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
