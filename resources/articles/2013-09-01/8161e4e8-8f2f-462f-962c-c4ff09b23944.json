Eastern State, a hulking, castle-like structure that now looks quite out of place in its quiet neighbourhood, was the eventual result. Cells were designed to isolate prisoners from all human contact, under the assumption that anyone left completely alone with their crimes would become penitent \u2013 hence the new term \"penitentiary\". It's still creepy enough to be the site of an enormous \"haunted house\" attraction every autumn, and to have its audio tour narrated by Steve Buscemi. \u2022 2027 Fairmount Avenue, easternstate.org. Open daily 10am-5pm. Adults $14, seniors $12, students and children $10 Independence Hall Many of the city's historical spots relating to the founding of America are within walking distance of this three-square-block national park. The biggest draw is the famously cracked Liberty Bell (actually forged in England in 1751). A block away is Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Constitution was adopted. Though you'd think Independence Hall and the Constitution Center, right across the street, would contain their namesake documents, both are at the National Archives in Washington DC. The Constitution Center does, however, have a highly entertaining interactive hologram of hometown hero Ben Franklin. (Ask him about French women for a hilariously lecherous response.) \u2022 Fifth and Market streets, nps.gov/inde. Independence Hall open daily 8.30am-6pm, Liberty Bell open 9am-4.55pm. Tickets free but tours must be booked M\u00fctter Museum The M\u00fctter (rhymes with \"looter\") Museum's collection includes the shared liver of original Siamese twins Chang and Eng, pieces of Einstein's brain, the Hyrtl skull collection, all sorts of bottled foetuses, and a nine-foot colon. Though all the antique surgical tools and medical oddities are meant to inspire an appreciation of medical history, the array of pre-1960s gynaecological instruments mostly inspires a fervent gratitude for the modern era. \u2022 19 S 22nd Street, collegeofphysicians.org/mutter-museum. Adults $15, military and seniors $13, students and six-17s $10, under-sixes free. Open daily 10am-5pm Benjamin Franklin Museum After the Liberty Bell and the weird green creature that is the Philadelphia Phillie Phanatic, Ben Franklin is probably Philadelphia's primary mascot. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, James Madison \u2013 they got to be president, but calling them \"beloved\" is a stretch. Philly loves Ben Franklin, as evidenced by something being named after him every 10 feet \u2013 Franklin Square, Ben Franklin Parkway, Ben Franklin Bridge, Franklin Field, Franklin Mills, the Franklin Institute ... our hardcore soccer fans even call themselves the Sons of Ben. It's hard not to love Franklin, who was an abolitionist before it was cool, ran the Onion paper in the 18th century, was central to setting up a new form of government, played the wine glasses, proved that lightning was electricity, published a list of 220 words for being drunk, and essentially invented the modern American library, hospital, postal service, public college and reformatory prison. This guy's life is fascinating; find out more about him at the Benjamin Franklin Museum, which recently reopened after a long renovation. \u2022 317 Chestnut Street, nps.gov/inde. Open daily 9am-5pm. Adults $5, four-16 years $2, under-fours free The Magic Gardens South Street was Philly's equivalent of New York's East Village in the 1960s and 1970s, a wasteland revitalised by bohemians. South Street is mostly cheap retail and crowds of teenagers these days, but its former life is visible in the mosaics of Isaiah Zagar, which spangle random buildings like a particularly beautiful lichen. The epicentre is the Magic Gardens, a former vacant lot that Zagar spent decades turning into a enormous, multi-level art environment \u2013 every surface covered with his trademark ceramic-and-mirror tiles. \u2022 1020 South Street, phillymagicgardens.org. Open Sun-Thurs 11am-5pm and Fri-Sat 11am-6pm. Adults $7, students and seniors $3, six-12 years $3, under-fives free Mummers Museum Philly's annual Mummers Parade is the oldest folk festival in the country, if you can still call it that. It's related to the traditional British mummers plays, but distantly \u2013 if you were Darwin, it would be like finding a species of finch that had been stranded on an island where survival was linked to an odd, strutting dance, glitter, marching banjos, bedazzled umbrellas, huge feathered headdresses and beer. Lots of beer. Mummery has been the domain of blue-collar white men since its beginnings as a melding of the holiday traditions of the lower-class South Philly river ward immigrants from Sweden and the British Isles. Over the years, this coalesced into something more like Mardi Gras, with distinct subdivisons like Fancy Brigades, String Bands, Comics and dozens of serious clubs spending the better part of a year putting together their spangled costumes and performances. The first formal Mummers parade in 1901 was in part an attempt to corral all the rowdies into one place but, even today, the procession up Broad Street from South Philly to City Hall is only half the point \u2013 after dark, everyone heads back down to South Philly by the river to channel their rowdy forebears. For the full experience, visit over New Year; if you just want a taste of something uniquely weird and Philadelphian, check out the museum in the heart of Mummer territory. \u2022 1100 S 2nd Street, mummersmuseum.com. Open Wed-Sat 9.30am-4pm, October-April. Adults $3.50, students, seniors and under-12s $2.50 Rittenhouse Square Philly's nattiest park is one of the five Center City public squares laid out in the initial plans by city founder (and Pennsylvania nakesake) William Penn who, with a typical Quaker lack of romance, named them Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest and Center. Center Square eventually was built up into City Hall, while in the post-Revolution days the eastern squares were renamed Washington and Franklin in honor of the Founding Fathers. Northwest (later Logan) Square became the site of public hangings. But Southwest Square \u2013 renamed in 1825 for astronomer, clockmaker, inventor and first director of the US Mint David Rittenhouse \u2013 has been the centrepiece of the wealthiest area in the city since just after the Civil War. The public park itself, with its diagonal sidewalks, central fountain and plenty of benches, is Philly's number-one spot for outdoor people-watching. Regulars include bike messengers waiting for a call, old-money grandmas walking Pomeranians, students from the nearby Curtis Institute of Music getting some fresh-air practice in, and the occasional amateur tightrope-walker. Sit down; stay a while. \u2022 18th and Walnut Streets, friendsofrittenhouse.org. Open Tues-Thurs and Sat 10am-5pm, Fri 10am-7pm Philadelphia Museum of Art Look out for the wannabe Stallones running up and down the front steps of the Parthenon-looking art museum in a constant mass reenactment of the famous scene from Rocky. You could easily spend a full week wandering the PMA's 10 acres without seeing everything, but be sure to catch the particularly good Duchamp collection. For bonus points, seek out his final work, \u00c9tant Donn\u00e9s, a creepy tableau behind an unmarked peephole. \u2022 2600 Benjamin Franklin Parkway, philamuseum.org. Open Tue-Sun 10am-5pm. Adults $20, seniors $18, students and 13-18s $14, under-12s free The Barnes Foundation Albert C Barnes amassed one of the world's greatest collections of impressionist and modernist art, and was as contrary as possible about displaying it. His eccentric arrangements put million-dollar paintings side by side with crafts, fixtures and even spoons. It lived out in the suburbs, far from the art establishment Barnes loathed. Intentionally inconvenient hurdles like only being open two days a week, complicated parking, and comically limited tickets kept the collection essentially off-limits to all but the most dedicated for decades. When Barnes died in 1951, his will was clear: the artworks must be kept \"in exactly the places that they are\". But after financial straits triggered a heated legal battle, the collection relocated to a shiny new building down the block from the PMA in 2012. Barnes's arrangements were painstakingly replicated \u2013 in exactly the places that they were (in relation to one another). Whether this is a triumph or a tragedy remains a bitter debate. \u2022 2025 Benjamin Franklin Parkway, barnesfoundation.org. Open Sat-Mon and Wed-Thur 10am-6pm, Fri 10am-10pm. Non-members $30, members $20 Reading Terminal Market Philly's main east-west thoroughfare is called Market Street because of the many produce stalls that clustered along a mile of it until the mid-19th century, when city officials \u2013 noting that the frenzy of open-air markets was interfering with streetcar traffic, not to mention constituting a public health hazard \u2013 consolidated them all at an indoor spot at 12th and Market. A few decades later, the Reading Railroad built a colossal train station over that spot, relocating the farmers and merchants yet again with promises of state-of-the-art refrigeration. But the market ended up outlasting the railroad, which ran its last train in 1971; if you happen to look up and notice that the roof of the modern-day Reading Terminal Market is an enormous, blocks-long arch, it's because the market's current home was once the widest train shed in the world. Today, Reading Terminal Market is a sprawling complex packed with people buying dirt-cheap produce \u2013 Thai curry, urban honey, roast pork sandwiches, quail and emu eggs \u2013 anything you can think of that's edible. The bearded and bonneted folk occupying the north-west section are the Pennsylvania Dutch, an Amish-related community based in western Lancaster County. Try their shoo-fly pie and sticky buns. \u2022 12th and Arch streets, readingterminalmarket.org.
