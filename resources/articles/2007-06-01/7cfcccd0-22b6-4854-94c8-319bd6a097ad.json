Several steps have to be negotiated before players set foot on to the pool floor which has been covered with green carpet. None of this would be remarkable were it not for the fact that Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic, the world's No3 and No6, honed their skills in this decrepit facility. With the Olympic-sized pool rarely being used, proving too expensive to keep warm during the winter and also leaking, the baths were transformed into tennis courts. The result is a makeshift arena that, with high walls flanking one side of each court, allows players only to hit the ball straight. In Britain we might laugh but in Serbia there is talk of having \"10 players in the world's top 10\". That is the dream of Slobodan Zivojinovic, the former Wimbledon semi-finalist who is now president of Serbia's tennis federation. Buoyed by the emergence of Jankovic, Ivanovic and Novak Djokovic, the world No5 in the men's game, Zivojinovic is plotting a future in which he hopes his homeland will dominate the sport. It is difficult to reconcile that vision with the converted pool but there are grounds, if not yet facilities, to believe Zivojinovic. Tennis is now challenging football and basketball as the No1 sport in Serbia, with the success at the French Open, where Jankovic and Djokovic reached the semi-finals and Ivanovic lost in the final, leading to a 40% increase in participation levels. The players have become celebrities, with their fame a useful tool for Zivojinovic. Having once \"begged\" TV stations to show tennis, Zivojinovic now has companies \"fighting over the rights\". Extra income is vital to a federation that, remarkably, does not own any tennis courts, rents a run-down building in Belgrade as its headquarters and operates on an annual budget of only \u0080500,000 (\u00a3337,000). Zivojinovic, who was appointed four years ago, knows there must be change, with a national tennis centre the priority. Plans have already been approved and, with government support, he is hopeful they can come to fruition in October next year. That will be too late for Jankovic, Ivanovic and Djokovic - all of whom trained overseas during the winter because of the lack of facilities in Serbia - but it is hoped that the next generation's parents will be spared the same expense as well as the swimming pool experience. \"We couldn't play across court because of the walls,\" recalled Sara Pesic, who trained with Ivanovic for 10 years. \"And on the other side you had to be careful because you would run on to the other court.\" It is those incredible conditions, however, that appear to have imbued Jankovic and Ivanovic with greater ambition. \"I think when you learn to fight for your position and you don't have anything given to you, or any financial help, that makes you stronger,\" said Jankovic. \"You mature a lot faster and become very strong mentally, so when you come to a place where you have good courts and everything is given to you, you appreciate it more.\" That is an opinion held throughout the tennis fraternity in Serbia and also an example cited time and again in response to questions about Britain's failure to produce more top-class players. \"I think you guys are trying to invent what you are doing wrong,\" added Zivojinovic. \"I don't think the [Lawn Tennis Association] is doing something wrong. I think it has to do with the nation. The British mentality is always tough but, if you have a lot of things, you are not too hungry.\" Mark Djokovic, a former professional who now coaches Novak Djokovic's two younger brothers at the plush, privately run Colonial Sun tennis club in Belgrade, is familiar with Britain's approach. \"I think the system in England is perfect but I think the people are not interested in tennis enough,\" he added. \"I know Alex Bogdanovic - he played in Partizan when I was a coach - and I know a lot about the British federation because I speak with his father. They give him everything.\" Not that budding players and coaches would be against similar support in Serbia. For all the success through adversity there is frustration that the federation has failed to provide more assistance. \"We have lost 10 or 15 players who had very good talent because their parents had no money and there was no money from the federation,\" said Jelena Gencic, a 71-year-old coach who discovered and worked with both Monica Seles and Novak Djokovic. Others are more pragmatic given tennis's low status in the past. \"We might have changed from a communist country but in sport we had the same rankings and that's why the ministry of sport didn't give tennis very much money,\" said Slobodan Vojinovic, director at the Red Star tennis club where Jankovic also trained. \"But things are changing now. The biggest help comes from the three players who are showing the way. Ministers want to be pictured with them.\" Increased political interest has encouraged Zivojinovic - \"Every week, every month, every year we are getting more support from the government\" - with the federation's president confident there will be an infrastructure in place that allows talent to be produced and developed in Serbia. That needs to happen sooner rather than later, with the federation predicting that within three years the 1,600 players currently registered between the ages of eight and 30 will double. With only one hard court in Belgrade, located at Colonial Sun and also used for basketball and football, those figures accentuate the importance of a national tennis centre. There could, however, be another development before then, with Novak Djokovic's father, Srdjan, planning to build his own academy. \"I see it as a good thing if Djokovic's father is opening a camp,\" added the Red Star director, Vojinovic. \"It's like an open market and the more competition the better.\" That should also drive down fees although according to Vojinovic, who proudly points to the pictures of Jankovic that decorate the Red Star club, tennis in Serbia has never been more affordable. \"Coaches used to book the courts and take as much money as they could from the parents but now the club employs the coaches.\" More people have taken up the sport as a result, with Zivojinovic's plans to introduce tennis to schools expected to generate further interest. The 43-year-old is eager to maximise potential and, mindful of Serbia's part in the Balkans conflict, knows success on the court also represents a chance to \"give the country a good image\". That will be even easier to achieve if he realises his ultimate goal. \"We have three players in the top 10 but is that it? No, we would like to have 10. I know it's difficult but there is a chance.\" Anything seems possible for a nation that produces tennis players in a swimming pool.
