Or do you think that work and play don't mix? With a work-culture that increasingly emphasises relationships between staff, it's not uncommon for people to get on famously with their superiors. But all this good-feeling is not without its problems. While having close friends in the workplace is statistically proven to help you succeed, being seen cosying up to the boss is a different matter entirely. In fact if the experts are to be believed, you might be better off not getting on at all. \"Being best friends or merely friends with the boss is treading a very fine line,\" says executive coach Dr Zaffran Shahzada of Imagine Action. \"There's nothing intrinsically wrong with it, but you have to understand that it won't necessarily help your career - it could actually make things more complicated where promotions are concerned. You have to be careful not to put your boss under unfair pressure, or have unrealistic expectations about where your friendship can get you.\" According to recent research conducted by US consultants Watson Wyatt Worldwide, employees are concerned about favouritism at work, and it is a key factor in de-motivating the workforce. But most bosses are well aware of how favouritism can affect team performance, and will take this into account when thinking through a promotion. Don't bank on a close relationship with the boss reaping dividends: your friendship could see you passed over in the promotion scramble to avoid accusations of preferential treatment. So, it won't win you a shiny new job title - but perhaps more importantly, just being seen to be a personal acquaintance of the person in charge can seriously damage your relationship with coworkers. \"If there are team-mates involved you can end up being accused of being the 'teacher's pet',\" says Dr Shahzada. \"Or, you could find your achievements are not respected because it's assumed you're being rewarded for your relationship with the boss rather than your own accomplishments.\" Can being friends with a superior ever work to mutual advantage? Where a close relationship of trust is concerned, friendship can certainly be more of a help than a hindrance. At least it is, according to billionaire socialite Yuki Oshima Wilpon and her PA Suzie Hadassi. Despite having worked together for three years, the pair have only succumbed to one blazing row. This was when Hadassi had to collect her boss from a party - which had gone on until the early hours - so that she could make a scheduled interview. It's important not to lose sight of the power dynamic, even if you're good friends, Hadassi says. \"I always know my place when dealing with work issues and it's best not to forget who the boss is and who employs who. When working I would normally keep my opinions to myself unless asked for and I think that is very important.\" Keeping your opinions to yourself when friends are involved isn't always easy - but in some sectors that might not be a problem. For director Katie Maloy and PR Suzy Holland, working together means a chance to express views which might otherwise get aired. Maloy co-owns PR company Touch Media, and knew Holland from a previous company. \"There was never any doubt we'd employ Suzy,\" she says. A year or so down the line the two are still working happily together, although Maloy admits there are times when the friendship can add less welcome dynamics. \"There are times when she annoys the hell out of me. And we do bicker about things in a way which most people probably wouldn't with their boss. She doesn't have that 'boss fear' of me that you would usually have with a superior.\" But with that fearlessness comes other advantages. \"Because we were starting up the company we've gone through a lot, and I know she really appreciates what we're trying to do,\" says Maloy. \"She's more than an employee, and it means that we don't have to hide behind formalities. If one of us comes into the office in a bad mood we know how to deal with one another. She'll even tell me if I'm in a foul mood - I don't know anyone else who could say that to their boss!\" The one disadvantage that both have found, however, is that social occasions can be marred by work-talk. \"We do find ourselves talking about work out of the office, and it's probably a good reason to spend less time with your colleagues,\" says Maloy. \"If I go home to my partner he doesn't necessarily know the finer details of what I'm working on, whereas when we go out from work we can end up having a brainstorming session.\" Workers beware - if you're not careful, a close relationship with your employer could even see you putting in extra hours unintentionally. With our work-life balance constantly under threat, this could be an extra worry. After all, so much time is now spent at the office that lots of us now term coworkers as close friends, and a large number of people meet their future partners at work. Perhaps what we should be worrying about instead is not whether a friendship with the boss scuppers our chances of promotion, but whether it prevents us from having a well-rounded life outside the office."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
