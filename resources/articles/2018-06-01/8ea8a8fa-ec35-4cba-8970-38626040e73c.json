The microsite is another plank in the ABC\u2019s renewed strategy to ward off more funding cuts and to answer critics who claim the broadcaster is a $1bn burden on taxpayers. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories every morning Guthrie\u2019s speech, in which she defended the ABC\u2019s legacy and purpose, is published in full on the site. A recent article by the ABC chairman, Justin Milne, who had, along with Guthrie been criticised for remaining silent in the face of growing attacks on the broadcaster, is also available. In a well-received speech, the managing director said journalists like the late Mark Colvin and the former 7.30 host Kerry O\u2019Brien were brands as famous as the lissajous logo that have made an \u201cindelible contribution to our collective understanding of Australia and the world\u201d. \u201cWe know and applaud their attributes and achievements: their deep knowledge of audiences and the issues that are relevant to the lives of the community; their relentless drive to ensure that the institutions and processes which are the foundations of our democratic system work to the benefit of that community; their determination to provide a voice for the powerless, the weak and the intimidated; their ability to shine the light on malfeasance and corruption,\u201d Guthrie told the press club. Data showing that Australia invests 34% less per person in public broadcasting than the average of comparable democracies is also available on the micro site and people are encouraged to sign up for a newsletter. The Community and Public Sector Union, which represents ABC staff, has also set up a website to campaign for public broadcasting. A recent program from Radio National\u2019s Money, The ABC of budget cuts, and a nostalgic video about the ABC 85-year history in radio, television and online are also featured on the ABC\u2019s Future of Public Broadcasting site. Guthrie\u2019s speech was delivered on the same day the Coalition party room discussed whether there should be a \u201ccost-benefit analysis\u201d for each of the ABC\u2019s programs. The Liberal party is in damage control after the national conference voted for a motion from the Young Liberals to privatise the ABC. Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday the president of the NSW Young Liberals, Harry Stutchbury, said there was so much content available freely on the internet the ABC was not needed. \u201cThe truth is that the ABC was designed for a bygone era, founded in the context of an underdeveloped media market, before TV, before radio matured and before the internet,\u201d Stutchbury said. \u201cToday, a publicly funded national broadcaster crowds out its private competitors and is an indulgence we can no longer afford. If any market failure still exists in the Australian media market it is in remote parts of rural Australia, this can be addressed without the full $1.04 billion budget of the ABC.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
