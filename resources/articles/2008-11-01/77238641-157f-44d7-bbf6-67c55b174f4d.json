Winds in the Sylmar area of northern Los Angeles, which gusted at up to 80mph yesterday, spreading embers across neighbourhoods, had fallen to gusts of just below 40mph, the US National Weather Service said. In Orange and Riverside counties, speeds had fallen to 25 mph, allowing firefighters to safely use deliberately-ignited backfires, designed to halt the spread of wild blazes by starving them of fuel. Since Thursday night the winds have helped fires scorch almost 29 square miles to the east and north-west of Los Angeles, destroying more than 800 houses, apartments and mobile homes and forcing thousands of people to flee. No one has been reported killed or seriously injured. California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has declared states of emergency in Riverside, Orange and Santa Barbara counties. Those forced from their homes have had to watch from a distance and hope for the best. \"I'm hoping my house will not burn down, but if it burns down that's my life, right? I've got to start from scratch again,\" Jack Chen, 56, told the Associated Press as he waited in a high school gym used as an evacuation centre. One of the worst single blazes devastated more than 11 square miles in Orange and Riverside counties during the weekend, destroying around 60 homes in Corona, Yorba Linda and the Anaheim Hills area, as well as 50 units in one apartment complex, according to firefighters. Six firefighters have been treated for injuries. Captain Leonard Grill of the Riverside County Fire Department said wildfires had become more common in recent years. \"It's gotten worse and worse every year. I can't keep track of them anymore,\" he said. \"These used to be the out-of-the-ordinary fires, once-in-a-career kind of fires. Now they're every year.\" Another fire spread across more than 12 square miles in the Sylmar area of Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley, destroying 500 mobile homes as well as around 20 other buildings. No deaths were reported at the park, but police said sniffer dogs would be brought in to search the rubble. Fire officials estimated that at the peak of the Sylmar fire, 10,000 people were ordered to evacuate. However, many evacuation orders were lifted last night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
