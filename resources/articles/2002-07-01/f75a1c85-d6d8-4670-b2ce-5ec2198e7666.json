The Ukrainian easily retained his lightly regarded title as he continued his march towards a championship showdown with Lennox Lewis, the best heavyweight in the world and holder of the WBA and IBF crowns. \"I think I can prove myself with a fight versus Lewis, Evander Holyfield or Mike Tyson,\" the 26-year-old Klitschko said after his win at the Trump Taj Mahal Hotel and Casino. Klitschko knocked down the overmatched 41-year-old Mercer in the first round and kept him on his heels thereafter. He hurt him with a straight right hand in the second round, opened a cut over his right eye in the fifth and pounded him relentlessly in the sixth. \"We don't want to look at how old he is,\" Klitschko said. With the victory, Klitschko improved to 39-1 with 36 knockouts and the 1996 Olympic gold medallist has now stopped 14 of his last 15 opponents. According to fight statistics, Mercer threw only 10 power punches and saw his record fall to 30-5-1. Weighing 243lb and holding a 15-pound advantage, Klitschko unleashed an awesome five-punch combination, and threw a pair of leading left hooks in succession that dropped Mercer with 30 seconds left in the first round. Mercer was listless throughout and appeared ready to quit in the sixth. He did not fight back for more than a minute before the referee Randy Newman stepped in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
