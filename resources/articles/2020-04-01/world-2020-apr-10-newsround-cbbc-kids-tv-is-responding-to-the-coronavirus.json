The BBC\u2019s long-running Newsround programme has seen its audience rise substantially for its three daily broadcasts on the CBBC channel and its dedicated website, with its reporters trying to find ways to provide optimistic takes on the news without sugarcoating the situation. \u201cSo many kids now have anxiety issues,\u201d said Ricky Boleto, a presenter on the programme. \u201cWe\u2019re letting kids know that we focus on what\u2019s happening in their homes and gardens without making them feel they have to sort out the world\u2019s problems \u2026 They\u2019re sending questions such as \u2018Is my grandmother going to die\u2019? We\u2019ve been trying to put them at ease.\u201d He said children \u201chave a very good moral compass, probably better than most adults\u201d and Newsround aims to cover stories without patronising audiences: \u201cThe most important thing for us is to tell stories in a way that doesn\u2019t presume knowledge, doesn\u2019t patronise, and makes young people feel that this is their programme.\u201d Plans to cut the number of Newsround\u2019s television broadcasts and reallocate the budget on online content have also been put on hold due to the pandemic. Instead, the web team have focused on providing simple clear guides to the pandemic for children. In the first week of the lockdown the Newsround website had 1.5 million unique visitors to its website, up 40%. It also offers the BBC a chance to prove its value to children and parents, especially as it faces a battle to retain the attention of kids once they reach the age of six or seven and they are tempted by YouTube and Netflix. The programme has seen an increased emphasis on asking children to submit their own material on how they are dealing with the lockdown while schools are closed: \u201cThere\u2019s scary headlines elsewhere but Newsround is a safe space for kids to turn to while coronavirus changes everything about our lives. We try to be a positive platform as well and focus on what good is being done.\u201d Other changes are having to be made to children\u2019s output. Amid the ongoing travel restrictions, the CBBC broom cupboard \u2013 the location where presenters introduce the next programme on the kids\u2019 channel \u2013 has been transferred to presenters\u2019 homes for the first time in 44 years. The BBC is also preparing to launch an enormous range of educational programmes from 20 April onwards. Matt Deegan, who runs the independent national children\u2019s radio station Fun Kids, said he has had to change the station\u2019s output to reflect the new reality: \u201cOur presenters refer to the fact that they\u2019re broadcasting from home and talk about the positives and sometimes the negatives.\u201d He has also launched a daily children\u2019s podcast called Stuck at Home, which has suggestions like using what\u2019s in the recycling bin as as source for collages or creating Zoom quizzes for other family members. It has also become the first piece of content from a commercial radio station to be made available on BBC Sounds. Deegan said young children pick up on the severity of the situation: \u201cI think there\u2019s an awareness by them that parents think it\u2019s serious and their sporadic anxiousness often gets eye rolls. The sheer volume of news drives parents to discuss things more openly than perhaps they normally would.\u201d Boleto, the Newsround host, said explaining the news in simple terms for children was a real challenge: \u201cNick Robinson and Evan Davis have said that writing scripts for Newsround is harder than their day jobs. You have to go from the start, not presume any knowledge, and tell the story.\u201d However, there is still space for some lightness on the show amid the pandemic gloom. He said: \u201cWe do still throw in the odd skateboarding dog and panda birth.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
