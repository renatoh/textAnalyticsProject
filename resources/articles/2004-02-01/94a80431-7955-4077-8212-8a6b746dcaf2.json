Since the charity's launch in November, more than three-quarters of holidaymakers who booked a winter or summer holiday with the operator First Choice have agreed to pay a voluntary donation to the charity. The Travel Foundation is aiming to raise \u00a31 million a year by 2006, which it says it will spend on projects that help tourism make a positive contribution to holiday destinations. First Choice is asking its customers to donate 10 pence per adult, 5 pence per child per holiday booking. Other UK operators, including The Adventure Company (formerly Travelbag Adventures) and Hidden Greece, will soon be providing similar fundraising schemes. Sunvil Holidays is already asking its customers to match its own donation of 50 pence per booking. First Choice's managing director Dermot Blastland said that the vast majority of customers have been very supportive of its scheme and he hoped holidaymakers would continue to offer their support to the charity, which he said can make \"a real difference to the destinations they are visiting\". The company will be increasing its suggested voluntary contributions to 20 pence per adult and 10 pence per child in its summer 2005 brochures. The Travel Foundation has already supported sustainable tourism projects in The Gambia and in Cyprus, where all the main tour operators are now offering excursions to the less well-known rural areas to help contribute to the livelihoods of local people. It plans to support similar tourism-related projects in other popular holiday destinations, including Mexico and Tobago, to help tourism make a greater contribution to the local people, environment and economy. The Foundation is one of the beneficiaries of Thomas Cook's foreign currency scheme that encourages customers to donate leftover currency on return from their holiday. The charity also welcomes direct donations. Further information: 0117 9273049, thetravelfoundation.org.uk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
