Stimpy (as in \"Ren and\") 6. Snowball - the much-ignored Simpson family cat 7. Azrael - angry, vicious, named after the angel of death, eats Smurfs 8. Custard (\"Roobarb and\") 9.

She was definitely the most attractive cat on TV for a hell of a long time. MrMydak I can't believe that so many men fancied Cheetara. I mean, she had whiskers, for chrissakes. biba24 Clarence the crossed-eyed lion from Dactari was one hell of a cool dude. Never even tried to eat the humans. cks172 Wot, no Cat Deeley?
