Sprake went to throw out to his full-back Terry Cooper but changed his mind and tried to hold on to the ball. He couldn't. It trickled into the net. Word passed round the Kop and, as Sprake ran out for the second half, he was given a rousing rendition of Des O'Connor's hit song at the time, Careless Hands. David Seaman Macedonia v ENGLAND, 2002 Once is unfortunate, twice is careless, but three times is a mid-life crisis. The then Arsenal keeper was lobbed from the half-way line by the former Spurs midfielder Nayim to give Real Zaragoza the Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. England were knocked out of the 2002 World Cup by Ronaldinho's freakish free-kick which flew over Seaman's ponytail. But worst of all was when he was beaten direct from an Artim Sakiri corner against Macedonia. Peter Enckelman Birmingham v ASTON VILLA, 2002, and ASTON VILLA v Birmingham, 2003 During the first Birmingham derby for 16 years an Olof Mellberg throw-in slipped under Enckelman's studs and into the net. He was then slapped in the face by a Burberry-clad Birmingham buffoon. Geoff Horsfield metaphorically repeated the gesture in the return fixture, capitalising on Enckelman's inability to claim an easy ball. Gordon Banks Northern Ireland v ENGLAND, 1971 Banks threw the ball in the air in readiness to punt it. George Best robbed him by dinking the dropping ball over the keeper's head and heading into the empty net. Scandalously the goal was disallowed and England escaped 3-1 winners. John Lukic Rangers v LEEDS, 1992 With his side 1-0 to the good and controlling play in their European Cup second-round, first leg tie at Ibrox, the Leeds goalkeeper fumbled an innocuous-looking cross into his own net after apparently losing sight of the ball in the floodlights. Ally McCoist added a second for a revitalised Rangers and Leeds never recovered. Andy Dibble Nottingham Forest v MANCHESTER CITY, 1990 Before hoofing the ball upfield Dibble used to hold it in the palm of his hand like an offering. That was until the day Forest's winger Gary Crosby took him up on it, heading the ball out of his hands and lashing it home. Jerzy Dudek LIVERPOOL v Manchester United, 2002 First Dudek allowed a cushioned Jamie Carragher header to squirt underneath him, presenting Diego Forlan with a tap-in. The Pole then gift-wrapped the Uruguayan's second goal. Sander Westerveld Bolton v LIVERPOOL, 2001 Dudek's Anfield predecessor Westerveld was axed soon after this Reebok classic. With the match petering out to a 1-1 draw the Dutchman let Dean Holdsworth's speculative long- range effort bend his hands backwards. G\u00e9rard Houllier was not impressed. Shortly afterwards two new keepers showed up and Westerveld was released. Massimo Taibi MANCHESTER UNITED v Southampton, 1999 Matthew Le Tissier scored some crackers from 30 yards in his time. This was not one of them. United's new \u00a34.5m Peter Schmeichel replacement got down to pick up the daisy-cutter, only for the ball to escape from his grasp. Gary Walsh BRADFORD CITY v Manchester United, 2001 The Bantams were heading for a priceless point until the former United goalkeeper took a mighty swing at the ball 15 minutes from time and missed. The ball hit a divot and bounced off Walsh's right foot just as he was kicking with his left. Teddy Sheringham walked the ball in and minutes later it was 3-0."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
