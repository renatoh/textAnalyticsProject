To make sure the England winger is any good, Spanish scouts will travel to watch him against Montenegro and Kosovo to see if he can deliver on the big stage. A return to the Premier League would at least give Bale the chance to learn who the prime minister is. The French champions, Paris Saint-Germain, are the latest team to show an interest in the Ajax goalkeeper Andr\u00e9 Onana. Spurs have also been linked to the Cameroon international and could challenge PSG next summer for his signature. The fee for the former Barcelona youngster would be in the region of \u00a335m, which is not to be sniffed at. If Chelsea\u2019s appeal against a two-year transfer ban is successful, they will spend January throwing cash around like the Wolf of Wall Street. The Lyon striker Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and wingers Wilfried Zaha and Jadon Sancho all feature on a post-Christmas shopping list and Frank Lampard supposedly has \u00a3150m to spend, which might get him two of those three. Back in 2018, Ed Woodward had a cunning plan to sign Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Marco Verrati for Manchester United, but that pesky Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was not keen, instead splashing out on Fred. Presently, their focus is on replacing the Brazilian with someone better, their main target being West Ham\u2019s Declan Rice. But Hammers fans needn\u2019t worry, as they have a cunning plan in the form of the Rosenberg full-back Birger Meling, who spent a year in Middlesbrough\u2019s academy way back when. A whole host of Premier League clubs are eyeing up Royal Antwerp\u2019s Aur\u00e9lio Buta, with Wolves, Newcastle and Watford all keeping tabs on the defender. Meanwhile, Leicester are also scouting in Belgium and have supposedly opened talks with Club Brugge over Emmanuel Dennis. One player looking to go nowhere is the on-loan PSG striker Mauro Icardi, who says: \u201cI will do everything to stay here.\u201d The Argentinian is on a season-long from Internazionale and he does not want to go back to Italy, one assumes as it is considerably harder to score goals in Serie A, the forward having scored seven goals in eight games since arriving in the French capital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
