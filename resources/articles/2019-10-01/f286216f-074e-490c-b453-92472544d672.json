The 47-year-old talks in such whispers that you could be forgiven for sensing he deals in international conspiracies rather than international football. Yet when Kenny speaks, those within Irish football have learned to listen. The Football Association of Ireland\u2019s succession plan, whereby Kenny would replace Mick McCarthy as the manager after a stint in charge of the under-21s, was ripe for ridicule when unveiled last November. The possibilities for trouble were endless. Kenny could at least shrug off the noise; it is in black and white that he will succeed McCarthy on 1 August 2020. McCarthy has been tetchy when pressed on the issue. More fool those who sensed Kenny might mark time with his young charges. A sellout crowd of 8,000 is due to attend Thursday\u2019s European Under-21 Championship qualifier as Ireland host Italy in Tallaght. At the same stadium only 19 months ago, 123 hardy souls watched the Irish defeat Iceland. Kenny\u2019s golden touch, so evident at club level \u2013 most recently Dundalk \u2013 is apparent again. Ireland have won three out of three in Group One as illustrious opposition come to town. But what if Kenny had struggled? What if his under-21 post had delivered only negative vibes in respect of the future? \u201cUltimately these are all possibilities but you can\u2019t be governed by fear,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cThere are no certainties but you have to have confidence and you have to back yourself to do well. I think it\u2019s important to have conviction and that\u2019s the way I view it. You can\u2019t be paralysed by fear. Life is short, you have to maximise everything you\u2019ve got and see the possibilities that exist.\u201d Likewise applies to personnel. If Ireland is a country supposedly devoid of deep football resource, Kenny will not be disheartened. Partly because he cannot be and partly after being in the audience for a lecture from Marcello Lippi in the aftermath of Italy\u2019s 2006 World Cup win. Lippi shone a light on Fabio Grosso, then of understated Palermo, rather than the stars of Juventus or the Milan clubs. \u201cI think there is a danger is focusing on what you don\u2019t have sometimes,\u201d Kenny explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not a league table to say: \u2018How many players have you got playing in the Premier League, how many games have they played.\u2019 The international team shouldn\u2019t reflect a league table of how many appearances people have and so forth. \u201cYou have to have your own vision of what you want, your own style of play and what fits that, what constitutes a team. You\u2019ve got to see it with your own eyes. You\u2019ve got to see the potential in people, even if they are not really excelling with their club. We have to utilise what we have got and, as a nation overall, show greater belief in ourselves.\u201d There are further breaches of convention. Kenny won\u2019t subscribe to the view that winning Ireland teams are an automatic consequence of rugged centre\u2011backs and the winning of second balls. \u201cThe players want to play in a progressive way, the supporters want to see a progressive team,\u201d he says. \u201cI think football is changing all the time and, believe it or not, the styles are evolving, so there is less cynicism in the game. Not on the outside, the periphery, but in the football itself. Some of the great teams in recent years have influenced teams all over to play in a more progressive way. In my view that has to be good.\u201d Kenny is anxious to point out his managerial journey \u2013 which began in Tallaght with a non-league side before he took over at Longford Town when aged just 26 \u2013 has not all been plain sailing. Dunfermline Athletic were relegated from Scotland\u2019s top flight on Kenny\u2019s watch in 2007. He had an ill-fated spell at Shamrock Rovers in 2012. Yet ask supporters of Bohemians, Derry City and Dundalk \u2013 Kenny transformed the latter two \u2013 about this manager and they will purr. Modesty is just one instantly identifiable Kenny trait. He is considerate, thoughtful, conscious of fine details and immensely proud of his current position. Any suggestion of management taking the Dubliner back across the Irish Sea is readily rebuffed. \u201cI\u2019m in the position I want to be in. Ireland is the ultimate ambition; to manage your country, there is no greater honour.\u201d Which is not to say Kenny will not be wooed by club football again. For the time being, his positioning just appears perfect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
