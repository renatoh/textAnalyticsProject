Funf\u2019", "bodyText": "The funniest standup I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 I went to see Daniel Kitson in Edinburgh and that left me feeling like I\u2019d had a spiritual experience. But in terms of a comedian who makes me scream with belly-muscle-pulling, roaring laughter, I will say Lou Sanders. She\u2019s an absolute dynamo. The funniest book I\u2019ve ever read \u2026 I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan. I listened to it as an audiobook while doing a temp job. Because of my stupid laugh, they caught me listening and I got fired. The funniest film I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 Team America: World Police. The funniest person I know \u2026 My dad. Once, when I was a student, I was doing loads of medical trials for money, including some where they took biopsies from the inside of my nose. He said: \u201cEventually, there\u2019ll be nothing left of you except a hand, holding a massive wodge of cash.\u201d The funniest hairstyle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 When I was five, I hid under a desk and ate a whole box of Dairy Milk miniatures and cut off all my hair, down to a few curly tufts. My mum was devastated but I really liked it because I looked like a boy called Dan at school. The funniest word \u2026 \u201cTuppence\u201d. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve trained my child son to call a vagina. The funniest joke I\u2019ve ever heard \u2026 What do Germans think comes between fear and sex? Funf. Jessica Fostekew performs at Monkey Barrel 4, Edinburgh, 1 to 25 August"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
