There are two crumbs of comfort for Henman. He is the only player to have beaten Roddick since the American lost to Roger Federer in the semi-final at Wimbledon. And, if two seeds drop out before the order of play is finalised on Sunday, he may yet avoid Roddick. Marat Safin remains doubtful with an injured left wrist and Albert Costa is suffering from a bad back. But for the moment Henman must prepare for Roddick, whom he beat 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 in Washington this month on his way to his 10th career title, saving a match point in the process. Henman was in ultra-buoyant mood after that win, and his victory over Fernando Gonzalez in the final. But, while Roddick was blazing an unbeatable trail in Canada and in Cincinnati, the Briton won only once in the two tournaments, and that when Gonzalez defaulted in Montreal. But the pressure on Roddick, seeded No4, and who has yet to win a grand slam title, will be intense. Pete Sampras is not defending and the nation expects Roddick, 21 next week, to take the crown. Henman, by contrast, having slipped out of thetop 30, will be under no great strain, although his record at Flushing Meadows is modest. Greg Rusedski, beaten US Open finalist in 1997 when he lost to Pat Rafter, opens against France's Gregory Carraz and may then play another Frenchman, Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment, who beat him in the second round in Cincinnati. Rusedski is perilously close to dropping outside the top 100 and badly needs at least two victories so as not to fall any further."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
