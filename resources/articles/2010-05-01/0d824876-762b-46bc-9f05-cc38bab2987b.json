The new television series based on the life of Spartacus, opening tonight on Bravo, is no exception. In this latest version of the most famous slave revolt in history, the Roman world is a place of improbably fabulous bodies, incessant foul-mouthed language, indiscriminate non-stop sex, and limb-hacking as mass entertainment. So are we watching Ancient Rome or the modern world here? The obvious truth is that it's a bit of both. Yet if Andy Whitfield's rebel gladiator in the new series is very much a 21st-century fantasy, he is also merely the latest example of each generation's need for its own Spartacus. In the 19th century the Italian novelist Raffaello Giovagnoli saw Spartacus as a forerunner of Garibaldi. German revolutionaries, following Karl Marx (who chose him as his hero), named their party after him. A Soviet Spartacus was commemorated in Moscow Spartak football team, Khachaturian's ballet and Czech communism's Spartakiade festivals. Elsewhere he became the progressive icon of Lewis Grassic Gibbon's and Howard Fast's mid-century novels, the latter of which was the basis of Stanley Kubrick's anti-McCarthyite 1960 film. To every age a Spartacus for its own purpose. Our bloody and full-frontal Spartacus may in fact be closer to the reality of ancient life than Kirk Douglas's heroic rebel on which an earlier generation grew up. But it would still be a pity if Spartacus lost all his old political resonance amid the sex and slaughter of today. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 May 2010. The original strongly implied that Spartacus in the new TV series is played by John Hannah. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
