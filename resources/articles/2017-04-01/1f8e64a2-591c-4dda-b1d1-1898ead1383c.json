Sadi G\u00fcven, the head of Turkey\u2019s high electoral board (YSK), confirmed the passage of the referendum on Sunday night, based on unofficial results. The yes campaign won 1.25m more votes than the no campaign, with only about 600,000 votes still to be counted, G\u00fcven told reporters in Ankara, meaning the expanded presidential powers had been approved. However, disparities persisted into Sunday evening, with the opposition saying not all ballots had been counted and they would contest a third of the votes that had been cast. G\u00fcven said the YSK had decided to consider unstamped ballots as valid unless they were proved to be fraudulent, after a high number of complaints \u2013 including one from the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) \u2013 that its officials had failed to stamp some ballot papers. The no campaign said the YSK\u2019s last-minute decision raised questions about the validity of the vote. But G\u00fcven said the decision was taken before results were entered into the system and that members of the AKP and the main opposition were present at almost all polling stations and signed off on reports. He said official results were expected in 11-12 days. The result of the referendum sets the stage for a transformation of the upper echelons of the state and changing the country from a parliamentary democracy to a presidential republic, arguably the most important development in the country\u2019s history since it was founded on the ashes of the Ottoman Republic. Erdo\u011fan said he would immediately discuss reinstating the death penalty in talks with the prime minister and the nationalist opposition leader, Devlet Bah\u00e7eli. The president said he would take the issue to referendum if necessary. The narrow victory will nevertheless come as a disappointment for the country\u2019s leadership, which had hoped for a decisive mandate for the plan that could see Erdo\u011fan remain in power until 2029 if he wins successive elections. The result will set the stage for a further split between Turkey and its European allies, who believe Ankara is sliding towards autocracy. The European commission said on Sunday night that Turkey should seek the \u201cbroadest possible national consensus\u201d in its constitutional amendments, given the yes campaign\u2019s slim margin of victory. Results carried by the state-run Anadolu news agency showed the yes vote had about 51.3% compared with 48.7% for the no vote, with nearly 99% of the vote counted. Turnout exceeded 80%. The country\u2019s three largest cities \u2013 Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir \u2013 voted against the changes, and so did the vast majority of Kurdish voters and many of the coastal cities, indicating a general decline in the ruling party\u2019s support. In a press conference in Istanbul following his party\u2019s declaration of victory, Erdo\u011fan said that unofficial results showed there were about 25m yes votes, 1.3m more than no. But in an unusually muted victory speech, Erdo\u011fan said foreign powers should respect the referendum\u2019s outcome. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to do, we are on this path but it\u2019s time to change gears and go faster \u2026 We are carrying out the most important reform in the history of our nation.\u201d Erdo\u011fan claimed support for constitutional change had risen in south-east Turkey and hailed a \u201cprofound\u201d jump in support for a presidential system that was unpopular just two years ago. Overseas votes were a \u201cbig part\u201d of that success, he said, adding that his new executive presidency would probably come into effect after the 2019 election. Erdo\u011fan called the prime minister, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, and other political allies to congratulate them on the victory, although, in an indication of the ruling AKP\u2019s disappointment, the deputy prime minister said they had received fewer votes than they expected. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m delivered a victory speech from the balcony at party headquarters in Ankara, where thousands of the party faithful gathered to celebrate the victory. He said: \u201cOur nation has made its decision and said yes to the presidential system. The ballot box result showed we will not bow to traitors and terrorists. Turkey has won; our nation has won.\u201d He said the government would use this opportunity to make a \u201cbrighter Turkey\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are brothers. We are one body, one nation. A new page has opened in our democratic history with this vote. Be sure that we will use this result for our people\u2019s welfare and peace in the best way.\u201d The mood was jubilant as Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m spoke. \u201cI am so happy I have tears in my eyes,\u201d said Irfan Ulu, an AKP voter. \u201cMy heart was about to explode because our society has been swinging so much from side to side.\u201d Oguzhan, another voter, said Erdo\u011fan\u2019s victory was a sign of Turkey\u2019s role in the region as a defender of the oppressed in the Middle East, a common refrain among party supporters. \u201cWhen Turkey wins, the whole world wins because we will be the voice of the oppressed around the world,\u201d he said. The main opposition party, however, cast doubt on the result. Erdal Aks\u00fcnger, vice chairman of the Republican People\u2019s party (CHP), said it would challenge 37% of the ballot boxes and accused Anadolu of publishing inaccurate results. The country\u2019s pro-Kurdish opposition party, which also opposed the constitutional changes, said it planned to object to two-thirds of the ballots. Didem Yalinay, who voted no at the \u00c7ankaya primary school in the largely secularist neighbourhood of Ayranc\u0131, said she did so because of the government\u2019s abuses against the opposition. \u201cPeople in Turkey do not feel good about this oppression and they have a chance to say no today,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe in the wisdom of the people of this country. I said no because I want justice.\u201d A couple aged 91 and 87, arrived with their granddaughter to cast their vote and described themselves as \u201cchildren of the republic\u201d. In tears, the granddaughter, who voted no along with her family, said: \u201cThis is a war without weapons. I am here to save my country.\u201d The vote caps two months of campaigning that has further polarised a divided country still reeling from a coup attempt in which 265 people were killed and hundreds injured, frequent terror attacks and the impact of the ongoing civil war in neighbouring Syria. The campaign refocused attention on government abuses in the aftermath of the coup, including a purge that has gone far beyond those who backed the putsch to target those who oppose the president\u2019s policies. Tens of thousands of academics, judges and members of the security forces have been dismissed and top opposition politicians and dozens of journalists have been arrested. Turkey has drifted away from its western allies, from a candidate for European Union membership in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s early years to a state of open hostility with the bloc now. EU leaders accuse the Turkish president of clamping down on freedoms, while he calls them \u201cNazi remnants\u201d and \u201cfascists\u201d who have been morally compromised by their treatment of Turkey and Syrian refugees.
