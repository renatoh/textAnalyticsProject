A number of viral videos have triggered the trend, with staff at multiple hospitals joining in with synchronised dance routines in their uniforms. Medics treating coronavirus patients at a hospital in Leeds received over 50,000 views on Twitter for their TikTok dance. The staff, working on ward J19 at St James\u2019 Hospital, performed a synchronised dance to The Weekend\u2019s Blinding Lights, a dance challenge that has taken the internet by storm over the past few weeks. Dr Walayat Hussain, a consultant dermatologist who has been redeployed to work on the ward treating Covid-19 patients, shared the video on Twitter and said: \u201cI\u2019m definitely not a bad influence on the ward...... Fantastic team on J19. Work hard, play hard.\u201d Speaking to The Yorkshire Evening Post, Dr Hussain said: \u201cThe team here are fantastic and the video has really helped us to get to know one another and boost morale. \u201cMaintaining good morale is really important at this time \u2013 at Leeds Teaching Hospitals we have a good staff health and well-being network as well as fantastic support from the public through donations to our charity Leeds Cares.\u201d They\u2019re just one of a number of hospitals to jump on the new trend. A group from the cardiology team at New Cross hospital in Wolverhampton created a TikTok video of them performing a viral dance routine in the corridor \u2013 quickly racking up over 1,000 likes. However, staff at the the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust took it a step further, teaming up with paramedics, police and fire crew for a collaborative dance in the car park. \u201cGoes to show that the team working skills are on point! We hope it makes you smile as much as it did us!\u201d, the trust said in a post on Facebook. At Calderdale Royal Hospital, staff from the surgical outpatients department wore signs asking people to stay at home as they performed their viral dance. Clinical support worker Helen Sykes, 44, organised the dance and uploaded the video to TikTok, as she thought it would be a good way to get the message across. \u201cThe response and support we\u2019ve had has been amazing. We\u2019ve been inundated with people commenting and sharing the video, when I last checked it had over 4,700 views,\u201d she told the Halifax Courier. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really emotional time for NHS staff \u2026 We\u2019re here saving lives and we want people to really think about what they\u2019re doing and to stay home as much as possible,\u201d said Helen. Clinical support manager Ruth Inlay added: \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the girls for putting a smile on everyone\u2019s face.\u201d Last month a video of medical staff from the frontline theatre team at Basildon hospital in Essex having a boogy to Olly Murs\u2019 Dance with Me Tonight went viral, with over 600,000 views. They later were later offered free tickets to Murs\u2019 show and treated to a video call from the man himself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
