But Davies is still 1,200 miles behind fifth-placed Vincent Riou and 1,900 astern of leader Michel Desjoyeaux on Foncia. Desjoyeaux has been achieving incredible speeds on his way to Cape Horn, 1,500 miles away, exceeding 400 miles in 24 hours. Davies, in an older boat, is a touch slower but said: \"It is very hard to keep a balance. I am always in 'kick ass' mode, but I try to be careful and maintain good average speeds. I don't talk to my boat but I talk to Chuck, my auto pilot.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
