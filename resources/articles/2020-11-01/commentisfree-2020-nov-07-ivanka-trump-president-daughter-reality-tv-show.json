Probably try hard to stay in the public eye", "bodyText": "What will Ivanka do next? \u201cI suggest that you visit FindSomethingNew.org,\u201d Ivanka Trump told unemployed Americans back in July. Tens of millions of people were out of a job because of the pandemic, and the White House\u2019s response was a useless website where they could Find Something New. \u201cNow, as a result of Covid, people need to, unfortunately \u2026 learn a completely new skill,\u201d Ivanka explained during the initiative\u2019s launch. Now, as a result of democracy, it looks like Ivanka may need to take her own advice. Her time as adviser to Daddy the president is drawing to an ignoble end. After four years of pretending to be a politician, Ivanka is going to have to find something else to do. As will Jared Kushner, her partner-in-crime. Ivanka entered the White House with a fashion business and a carefully cultivated personal brand. To begin with, she desperately tried to maintain the image of herself as an aspirational everywoman. \u201cI try to stay out of politics,\u201d she simpered to reporters, in her capacity as special assistant to the president. She walked a fine tightrope, attempting to appeal to her father\u2019s base without alienating the liberals she\u2019d hobnobbed with back in New York. Steve Bannon reportedly nicknamed Ivanka \u201cthe queen of leaks\u201d because she was constantly feeding reporters information designed to make her and Jared look good. Headlines crediting Javanka for preventing Trump from doing monstrous things routinely popped up in the early days of Trump\u2019s term, and the pair were talked about as a \u201cmoderating influence\u201d. In 2017, Ivanka even appeared on the cover of US Weekly with the headline \u201cwhy I disagree with my dad\u201d. You can\u2019t it have all, though. After four years of cheering her dad on, Ivanka\u2019s business has been dissolved and her brand has been destroyed. She gave up attempting to appeal to liberals a while ago and has now gone full Maga. Shortly before the election, for example, she declared she was \u201cunapologetically\u201d anti-abortion. And, on Friday, she supported her dad\u2019s delusions that he was the rightful winner, tweeting: \u201cEvery legally cast vote should be counted. Every illegally cast vote should not. This should not be controversial.\u201d It\u2019s not controversial at all, sweetie. What\u2019s controversial is Trump trying to stop the count of votes he doesn\u2019t like. So what is going to happen to Jared and Ivanka next? Are they going to suffer consequences for working in a racist administration that separated migrant children from their parents and callously bungled the coronavirus crisis? Are they going to be persona non grata in New York, which Trump labelled an \u201canarchist jurisdiction\u201d? Are they going to have to retreat to Florida and start new lives as talking heads on Trump TV? I would love to think that might be the case but I\u2019ve got a feeling they\u2019ll just slink back to New York and rehabilitate themselves. Ivanka is rumoured to be inundated with offers for her own reality TV show and, no doubt, will get a lucrative book deal. She may even get a job as the face of Goya beans. Jared, one imagines, will continue to preside over his family\u2019s real estate business and evict people from their apartments. They may find their former friends a little distant at first, but eventually they\u2019ll worm their way back into their old circles. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever going to hold up New York society as a bastion of ethics or good taste,\u201d former Page Six editor Paula Froelich told Town and Country. \u201cAt the end of the day you can always buy your way in, so will that change? Probably not, as long as [Javanka\u2019s] checks don\u2019t bounce.\u201d Which seems unlikely: the pair reported between $36,151,214 \u2013 $157,020,085 in income on their personal financial disclosures for 2019. I wouldn\u2019t even write off a return to politics for Javanka. If this election has shown us anything it\u2019s that Trumpism is here to stay. Donald Trump may not be getting another term, but Ivanka or Donald Jr could well take up the mantle in 2024. The nightmare isn\u2019t quite at an end, it\u2019s just finding something new to throw at us. NYPD \u2018anti-harassment\u2019 cop apparently loves harassing people James F Kobel, a New York police department officer, has been accused of posting racist and sexist messages online under the pseudonym \u201cClouseau\u201d. Which is embarrassing because Kobel is assigned to an office responsible for combating workplace harassment in the NYPD. He has now been reassigned but is still getting a taxpayer-funded salary. Ice attempts to deport witnesses in forced gynecological surgery scandal Allegations of medical mistreatment at a Georgia Ice facility are currently being investigated. Now, however, there are claims that witnesses are being deported. \u201cThey\u2019re getting rid of us,\u201d one woman told Vice News. Bangladesh\u2019s first religious school for third-gender people has opened An Islamic school for \u201chijras\u201d, whom Bangladesh officially recognized as a third gender in 2014, has opened in Dhaka. The BBC describes this as a \u201ctransgender\u201d school but hijras aren\u2019t synonymous with transgender people, although some have opted to identify as transgender. Women only one-third of expert voices in coronavirus media coverage And when they were quoted, it was likely to be in relation to issues like childcare. \u2018I think your hunter might be a female\u2019 A 9,000-year-old skeleton buried with a \u201cbig-game hunting kit\u201d has been discovered in Peru. Everyone assumed the hunter was a man, but it turns out it was a woman. Additional women were discovered nearby who are also thought to have been hunters. Seems like hunter-gatherer society wasn\u2019t so neatly split along the gender lines people thought it was. Tracy Chapman is Talkin\u2019 \u2019Bout a Revolution again On Monday, Chapman gave her first TV performance since 2015 and performed her classic, while making a plea for everyone to vote. Watch it here. The week in Petriarchy Rabbit Hash, a hamlet in Kentucky, has a peculiar name and a peculiar tradition: it only elects animals as mayors. It has just elected its new mayor, a French bulldog named Wilbur. Congrats to Wilbur. No doubt he will be a much better politician than Kentucky\u2019s senator, Mitch McConnell. Who professes to be a human but looks very suspiciously like a swamp turtle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
