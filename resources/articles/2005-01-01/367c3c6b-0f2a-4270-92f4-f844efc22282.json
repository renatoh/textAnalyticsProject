There was some damage to staghorn coral in shallow waters off the Similans. 'A lot of the damage that occurred is due to sand covering the coral,' said a tourism spokesman. 'They can survive like that for two weeks, but after that they will die, so if many volunteer divers help now those partially damaged coral can still be saved.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
