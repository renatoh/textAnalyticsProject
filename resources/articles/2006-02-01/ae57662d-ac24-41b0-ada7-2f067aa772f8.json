It's all about the pancakes, today, let's face it. And while we're facing it, let's drool a little. Delia's pancakes, Nigel's pancakes, fancy vegetarian pancakes, more pancakes, and tips (tips about pancakes). And you know what's really good with pancakes? Television. Lemon, sugar - and a large spoonful of television. And what scrumptious broadcast media fillings could you cram into your crepe this evening? Find out now, with the picks of tonight's television, taken from this week's Guide ... Jimmy's Farm 9pm, BBC2 Geezer-ish farmer Jimmy Doherty has now been on his Suffolk smallholding since 2003, and thus far he's weathered \"fire, flood, and electrocution\". Fortunately, for viewers, \"his real problems have just begun\". Jimmy's staff of 10 have contributed heavily towards the farm's monthly overheads of \u00a340k, business is slow, and the strain of living in a quartet of caravans is beginning to tell -- \"even the animals are stroppy\". It's make or break time for the pig man. Joss Hutton Thin Ice 10pm, BBC2 Paltry tale of triumph on the ice against the odds. The producer of Phoenix Nights has managed to back another scene of northern decrepitude, but with none of the idiosyncratic humour. This is a traditional comedy of the worst kind (ie it's not funny) relying on the apparently inherent humorous qualities of working class stereotypes. Two trainers, Bitchy Barbara and Saintly Jeanette, are locked in a power struggle while the ice rink tries to recapture its Torvill and Dean glory days with a new champion. Stick with Dancing on Ice and the Winter Olympics for better TV icescapades. Clare Birchall No Angels 10pm, C4 Series three, and the sex in the city sisters are still chasing their Dr Kildares. Kate whisks everyone into quarantine when a suspect package of anthrax (\"and a picture of Osama bin Laden\") blows in through the ward; and Anji quits nursing after being found reeking of booze. Meanwhile, Jamie and Lia, to their own disgust, have become a nauseating pair of cuddlum wuddlum bears, prompting the observation, \"I preferred it when you two were trying to kill each other.\" Ali Catterall The Wire 9pm, FX Bunk finally manages to get Landsman off his back after he guilt trips Omar into helping him to track down the missing service revolver. Colvin's Hamsterdam experiment is in full swing, with even junkie informant Bubbles shocked by the openness of the dealing -- and McNulty and Kima stumbling across it. Meanwhile, Avon's back on the street, more interested in his corners than String's real estate moves, and in one of those great Wire details you just know will have repercussions, Barksdale soldier Bernard gives in to his girlfriend and buys a stack of \"burner\" phones from the same shop... Richard Vine Battlestar Galactica 9pm, Sky One This sci-fi series continues to surprise and delight with its smart, credible look at human survival against incredible odds. Now the ragtag fleet is reunited and, in an effort to ease the population's distrust of the military after martial law was enforced, a television news crew is given unlimited access to Galactica -- even in space they have better reality shows than we do. Ex-Xena: Warrior Princess Lucy Lawless plays the reporter who interviews the crew and sees firsthand the incredible pressure they are under. This doesn't mean the plot grinds to a halt -- the Cylon/human pregnancy develops complications and the Cylons themselves hint that their plan for mankind is far more disturbing and complicated than simple genocide. Phelim O'Neill Storyville: My Architect 10pm, BBC4 Nathaniel Kahn's father was the legendary architect Louis Kahn, who died in 1974 when Nathaniel was just 11 years old. Nathaniel spent five years attempting to uncover the man who was a genius at designing buildings but a disaster in his personal life -- he died penniless, leaving behind three different families. The film, which was nominated for an Oscar, combines interviews with Louis' contemporaries, such as Frank Gehry and IM Pei, with those of family members in an attempt to understand the man and his art.
