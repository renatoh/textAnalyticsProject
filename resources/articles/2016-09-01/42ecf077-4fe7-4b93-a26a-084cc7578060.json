The Italy international, who moved from Liverpool on deadline day after a desperate spell at Anfield, struck after seven minutes with a penalty, his first league goal since 22 September last year. Balotelli added a second, 12 minutes from time, after the visitors Marseille had taken the lead through Florian Thauvin and Bafetimbi Gomis before Wylan Cyprien snatched victory for Nice in the 87th minute. The two league goals were more in 78 minutes for Nice than his entire Premier League total at Liverpool which amounted to one against Tottenham Hotspur. However, rather than accepting criticism for his wretched spell on Merseyside, the 26-year-old told the French television station Canal Plus that the club were to blame. Asked by a reporter what had gone wrong in his career, he said: \u201cI joined Liverpool. It was the worst mistake of my life. Apart from the fans, who were fantastic with me, I must be honest, and the players, who I had a good rapport with, I didn\u2019t like the club. \u201cI had two coaches, Brendan Rodgers and J\u00fcrgen Klopp. As people they didn\u2019t make a good impression on me. I didn\u2019t get along with them.\u201d According to the BBC, Balotelli claimed he can still win the Ballon d\u2019Or in an interview with the former France midfielder Olivier Dacourt. \u201cOf course. It\u2019s not too late,\u201d Balotelli said. \u201cI think I could have already won it by now, but by working hard in training I could still win it in the next two or three years.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
