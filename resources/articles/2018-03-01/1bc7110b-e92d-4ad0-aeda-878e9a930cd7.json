While Tyson Fury continues to rant in the wings \u2013 and is justly proud of having shed four stones since announcing his comeback \u2013 Joshua, who holds the IBF and WBA belts, and Parker, the WBO champion, remain focused, understated and, despite prodding from the media, respectful of each other. However, they are still looking for weaknesses and Joshua believes he might have found one: stage fright. This will be his third stadium fight, probably in front of a Cardiff audience close to 80,000, while the New Zealander will experience that extraordinary rush for the first time. \u201cThe atmosphere can swallow you up,\u201d says Joshua. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. A certain amount of noise can smash glass, based on the frequency. And that sort of noise, booming, it gets you in a fight. You can become desperate. But, honestly in terms of my 20 fights, I always step into the ring and I\u2019m looking at Eddie [Hearn, the promoter] and thinking: \u2018He\u2019s made this ring smaller.\u2019 But I feel comfortable in a ring.\u201d Does he think Parker \u2013 a low-key character who betrays no sign of nerves \u2013 would be similarly at ease when they enter the ring at the Principality Stadium on Saturday night? \u201cEveryone is different. I don\u2019t know how he will deal with it but there are so many eyes on you. You become desperate and start questioning everything. Are my boots right? Are my shorts right? Do I look all right? \u201cThere are certain situations you feel comfortable in and certain situations you can handle. But you see some people who aren\u2019t comfortable in certain situations. They\u2019re fidgety, they\u2019re not who they really are \u2013 and that\u2019s what happens sometimes when you\u2019re in an arena you haven\u2019t been in before in front of so many people. You can act out of character. \u201cI tried to block the noise out before [in his Wembley fight against Wladimir Klitschko and his last defence, in Cardiff, against Carlos Takam], but that was a big mistake. You have to ride the energy. You use too much emotional energy trying to block it out because there\u2019s so much. You just have to embrace it because it\u2019s overpowering.\u201d On that they are agreed. Parker says the occasion will not overwhelm him because he is here to enjoy it. He has his parents ringside, and his brother, John, will be in his corner. He did not bring a big entourage, but they are all close and he was comforted that New Zealand were doing so well in the first cricket Test against England. Fighters, well known to be superstitious, look for all sort of helpful omens, but they know that when their seconds step back and the bell goes, they are in the loneliest place in sport. While Parker\u2019s trainer, Kevin Barry, insists his fighter\u2019s resume has more impressive names on it \u2013 apart from Klitschko \u2013 Joshua has that experience against the Ukrainian that probably will stay with him for the rest of his career: he went down against the acknowledged best champion of the previous decade, got up and knocked him out \u2013 in front of a baying crowd of 90,000 fans. That cannot be replicated in the gym, nor even in an indoor fight in front of 20,000. It is unique and rare. When Joshua beat Klitschko, he proved to himself and others that he has that priceless quality. He regrouped under pressure and finished the job. \u201cSomeone asked me, if I get Parker hurt, will I go in and execute. That\u2019s where you have to be a bit clever and do what you did to get them hurt. When you get them hurt you\u2019re like: \u2018Bang\u2019. But, if you can do what you did to get them hurt in the first place, it\u2019s learning how to execute in more of an assassin style rather than a brave warrior riding through on a horse slinging a weapon and killing everyone. I\u2019m trying to be a sniper. That\u2019s probably my mindset now, be a bit more calculating.\u201d While the bookmakers have posted odds with a flag in one hand, Joshua should deliver on his promise, probably in the later rounds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
