For all that the Harlequins player\u2019s wounds have healed, against Gloucester he was again outshone by a breakdown specialist who turned in a man of the match performance \u2013 Matt Kvesic\u2019s audition for England\u2019s No 7 shirt could hardly have gone better. The flanker made 15 tackles and three turnovers on Sunday \u2013 one of which halted a dangerous Quins move and immediately set up a try. There, in microcosm, was a reminder for anyone who needed it why Eddie Jones will surely align England with the rest of the world\u2019s elite teams and select a specialist openside. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s advanced my claim but it\u2019s probably handy. It\u2019s good to get a reasonable performance under my belt,\u201d was Kvesic\u2019s modest assessment and, in truth, most of the Twickenham faithful did not need reminding. Memories of David Pocock and Michael Hooper blowing England out of the water at the breakdown are still fresh, as is the potency shown by South Africa\u2019s Francois Louw, Wales\u2019s Sam Warburton and of course New Zealand\u2019s World Cup winning captain, Richie McCaw. Jones, the England coach, has been impressed by another Harlequin, Jack Clifford, who has been playing in the No 7 shirt with Robshaw on the blindside since the World Cup. Jones is understood to rate Clifford\u2019s qualities in the loose but, when it comes to the breakdown \u2013 assuming Steffon Armitage remains out of bounds while playing at Toulon \u2013 then the 23-year-old Kvesic heads the queue. He has only two caps to his name, both won on the 2013 summer tour to Argentina, and was cut from the World Cup training squad, but the impact that scavenging No 7s had at the tournament may have enhanced his claim. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It means you keep getting compared to Hooper and Pocock and they are absolutely on fire,\u201d says Kvesic. \u201cBut there\u2019s definitely a place for it in the game, with Australia playing with two sevens, with McCaw and then with Wales as well. It has highlighted the need for a seven.\u201d At 6ft 2in Kvesic, below, is taller than he looks but out of all England\u2019s openside contenders, a list that also includes Leicester\u2019s New Zealand-born Brendon O\u2019Connor and Saracens\u2019 Will Fraser, his is the physique most suited to the dark arts of the breakdown. Similarities to Neil Back extend beyond the short blond hair. \u201cI know there\u2019s going to be a lot of competition,\u201d Kvesic adds. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk of specialist sevens, we have an abundance of good sevens, it\u2019s good and it\u2019s healthy for the country. \u201cBut you have to be as individual as you can to try and get picked. There will be competition for places but that\u2019s what the best teams have.\u201d The 23-year-old was part of the 2011 under-20s side that lost the junior World Cup final to New Zealand, playing alongside Mako Vunipola, Joe Launchbury, George Ford and Owen Farrell. His opposite number in that final was Sam Cane, who has 31 caps and captained the All Blacks at the World Cup despite vying with McCaw for his place. So why has Kvesic been overlooked by England? Stuart Lancaster\u2019s loyalty to Robshaw is an obvious place to start but Kvesic made 29 tackles without missing one on his debut against the Pumas and was no less impressive in his second outing. Perhaps more significant was a dip in form following a move from Worcester to Gloucester just after that tour, but he is forthright in his view that last season\u2019s performances were as good as that produced in the thrilling 39-39 draw on Sunday. \u201cI was disappointed not to make the World Cup squad but I came back into Gloucester straight away, into pre-season, and [England] was put on the back burner,\u201d says Kvesic. \u201c[Not making the World Cup] was disappointing, I think everyone that got cut would have been disappointed. \u201cI would have loved the chance to play in a couple of games but that\u2019s been and gone now. \u201cIt does drive me, but it was more that I wanted to replicate what I did at Gloucester last season. I had a good season there, I know we didn\u2019t do that well in the league but we managed to win the Challenge Cup.\u201d Gloucester\u2019s director of rugby, David Humphreys, does not need convincing, labelling Kvesic \u201cthe England international No7-in-waiting\u201d after watching his performance at Twickenham. Perhaps the more telling remark about Kvesic\u2019s contribution came from the Harlequins director of rugby, Conor O\u2019Shea, however. \u201cMatt was outstanding around the breakdown [but] you could argue that some of the places he was coming from were interesting to say the least.\u201d It is a refrain that has been exhausted by the newly retired McCaw\u2019s opponents over the years and, if international coaches are soon repeating it about Kvesic, Jones may be on to something."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
