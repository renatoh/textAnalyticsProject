I paid \u00a3484.34 for travel insurance with a different company. Three weeks before departure, Chalfont Line informed me that the trip had been cancelled due to insufficient take-up and that I would receive a full refund. However, when I asked about the insurance payment, I was told that as a goodwill gesture I would receive a refund of half. When I complained, I was promised that as a further goodwill gesture I would receive the whole amount after all. But two weeks later I'm still waiting and fear they are trying to fob me off. HP, Liverpool This exposes yet another of those grey areas in which consumers are left helplessly floundering. If you had bought the policy from the agent they would have had to refund you \u2013 but only if you could prove you could not transfer it to another holiday. As for third-party insurance cover, guidance from the Office of Fair Trading says that in your circumstances, a refusal to refund is \"open to challenge\". Travel industry body ABTA recommends its members do the decent thing, but a spokesman says it's not clear whether the company is breaking the law if it doesn't. What is clear is that companies fear negative headlines, so after I got in touch a full refund was speedily dispatched. Chalfont Line blames a delay in receiving money from its suppliers, although that doesn't explain why it apparently ignored all your attempts to contact it.
