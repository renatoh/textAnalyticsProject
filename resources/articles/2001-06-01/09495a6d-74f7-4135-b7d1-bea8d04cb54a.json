Other than cards and backgammon, what can you suggest for a family of four whose ages range from 10 to 50? An age-old favourite, Scrabble now comes in a magnetic pocket-size version that you can unfold and play anywhere. Are the letters very small? And isn't it a bit fiddly? The case is the size of a small watercolour paint set. It has two trays to store the magnetic letters and a holder for those that aren't being used which slides out of the case. You can even transport it with the game half-finished. How do you score? There are small number counters at all four sides of the board. What does it cost and where do I buy it? It costs \u00a310.
