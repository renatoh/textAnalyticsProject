At the party\u2019s launch in Bristol on Wednesday, the climate emergency took centre stage and is likely to dominate the party\u2019s manifesto, due out within a few days, with pledges to borrow \u00a3100bn to cut emissions and protect against the impacts of global heating. But Si\u00e2n Berry, the party\u2019s co-leader and London mayoral candidate, made it clear that social justice was also high on the party\u2019s agenda, and the biggest cheer in Bristol came for a promise to build affordable housing. Nationally, the Greens had their best ever year in this year\u2019s local and European elections, rising to 362 local councillors and seven MEPs. But in the 2017 general election, the party\u2019s share of the national vote more than halved to just 1.8%, compared with its record 3.8% in 2015. Carla Denyer, the Green candidate for Bristol West, thinks that fallback was largely because of the impact of the Brexit referendum on the 2017 result, but believes much has changed since then, particularly in voters\u2019 perceptions of the Labour party. She said: \u201cIn the 2017 election a lot of people were Corbyn fans in Bristol but they are going off him. A lot of people believed in 2017 that Labour was a remain party. I think the political atmosphere is much closer now to 2015 than it was in 2017.\u201d Activists believe Labour\u2019s seemingly comfortable majority in Bristol West is less robust than it appears. In 2017, on a 77% turnout in this constituency that voted 79% for remain in the referendum, the Labour incumbent Thangam Debbonaire won a 37,000 majority \u2013 one of the biggest in the country \u2013 on a 30% swing to Labour. The Greens won fewer than 10,000 votes. But in 2015, Labour took the seat on a much smaller margin with 22,900 votes compared with 17,200 for the Greens in second place, with the Lib Dems trailing far behind. Denyer, a mechanical engineer and wind farm designer, told the Guardian voters were also thinking beyond Brexit, saying: \u201cPeople are much more aware of the climate emergency now. Bristol wants to be a green city, and people all over the country recognise that we need a big change to deal with the climate.\u201d Extinction Rebellion is estimated to have about 10,000 supporters in the Bristol area, and there has been strong local support for measures such as the council declaring a climate emergency, and the council\u2019s decision to ban diesel cars from areas of the centre. Many people on the streets of Bristol seem receptive to environmental messages. Rachel Fountain, a local voter, said: \u201cI think this election will be an environment election. Extinction Rebellion are very strong here. But there is also a social housing problem here, that will be an issue.\u201d Nick Swales, a council worker, also cited the climate crisis and the environment as top issues for people in the area, though he predicted that Brexit would dominate the election. Alice Evelegh-Taylor, a lawyer walking her baby son through Queen Square, said she had always voted Liberal Democrat but would not this time because \u201cthey have gone bonkers\u201d by pledging to revoke article 50. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to vote Labour and I could not vote for the Tories. The environment is a massive concern \u2013 I\u2019d like to know if the Greens\u2019 ideas are properly costed, though actually even if they are not, who cares? It\u2019s the environment\u2013 we will have to find the money.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
