How often have journalists written of candidates bouncing in battered jeeps along dirt roads, of surging rallies in dusty market town squares, and, later, of voters toiling in from remote villages to have their say, or of patient queues outside polling stations in the slum quarters of great cities? But what to do when these voters, whose enthusiasm is otherwise so gratifying, seem to be readying themselves to say something unwelcome or even dangerous? What to do when democracy is about to make a mistake? That, in a nutshell, is the issue raised by the distinguished signatories of a letter on the Indian elections published by the Guardian last week. They say they do not wish to question the \"validity of India's democratic election process\", and yet they go on to say that Narendra Modi is a bad candidate, a compromised politician and a man who ought not to be prime minister of India. This is not a normal partisan statement. The writers say nothing about Rahul Gandhi, Mr Modi's opponent, or about either of the two leading parties, and the kind of Indian voters who might be influenced by their letter are exactly the ones who would already be in the anti-Modi camp. This is a letter which is more about what its authors deem to be the truth about a candidate for high office than about the outcome of the election, an outcome to which they may already be resigned. Nor are they alone in their anxieties. \"Can anyone stop Narendra Modi?\" the Economist recently asked, a formulation which reflects the tone of nearly all outside coverage of the Indian elections so far. Europe is no stranger to such dilemmas, faced with Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, Vladimir Putin in Russia, or Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary. Electors everywhere have a habit of picking leaders whom liberals do not like \u2013 and that, in a sense, is the answer to the question. If Indians do choose Mr Modi it will be because they are ready to choose him, because certain changes in Indian society have prepared the way for him, and because the Indian secular and pluralist model, what might be called the Nehru state, no longer has the appeal it once had. Nor was it ever such a shining beacon. The invasion of Goa, wars with China and Pakistan, the adoption of nuclear weapons, the emergency, the assassination of Indira Gandhi, failures in development in the old socialist period and in the more recent free-market era \u2013 it is hardly an unspotted record. In practice, Mr Modi would be constrained in office by the need for allies at the centre and in the states. Those who despair at the likely outcome can perhaps console themselves with the thought that nobody ever wins completely in India."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
