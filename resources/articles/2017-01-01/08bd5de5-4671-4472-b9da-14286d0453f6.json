The drone hovering in the grey afternoon sky above Saracens\u2019 training ground is an illustration, tracking the players\u2019 every move. Human assistants stare unblinkingly at GPS readings on their iPads, almost as if the distant on-field figures are remotely controlled. It is not an environment for the shy or diffident; literally and psychologically there is nowhere to hide. To survive, let alone prosper, requires thick skins and strong minds, regardless of age or background. There is a certain superficial glamour about top-level rugby but, mostly, it is hard yakka, particularly as the January winter weather worsens. You have to want it so badly that nothing else matters. To represent your country you have to want it even more. Even after all that you will be flattened by the relentless Owen Farrell, the steeliest warrior of the lot, the Saracen who wants it more than every player, coach and smooth drone operator combined. A total break from the game proved impossible even when England\u2019s tilted\u2011head assassin escaped to Hope Cove in south Devon last weekend to shake off a minor bug. \u201cYou can always feel like you should be doing something,\u201d he says, almost apologetically. Give him a day off and he is liable to end up watching rugby on TV, although a new puppy \u2013 a Hungarian Vizsla named Ronnie \u2013 offers some distraction. \u201cI still watch all the games, not because I feel I have to but because it\u2019s what I enjoy. I\u2019m not sure my girlfriend does.\u201d As another world-class goal-kicker, some bloke named Jonny Wilkinson, could testify, there is a desperately thin line between dedication and obsession. Pros tend not to discuss the \u201cO\u201d word much; it implies they are in the grip of something they cannot fully rationalise. So, Owen, is that how it feels? \u201cYou can become obsessive but you enjoy it \u2013 that\u2019s what you like doing. It is just how I am. I don\u2019t try my hardest to be like this.\u201d Is it getting easier to cope with? \u201cOver the last year I have become more in control of it. I don\u2019t feel like I have to hit so many kicks. I have become a lot better at thinking: \u2018Is it actually helping? Am I OK? OK, stop.\u2019\u201d Whatever motivates Farrell as he surveys the distant posts, it is working. He has 540 points for England, second only to Wilkinson\u2019s haul (the latter had 680 at this same juncture) of 1,179 points in 91 Tests and 140 clear of Paul Grayson, the man he overtook against France in last year\u2019s Six Nations. The \u201cnew Jonny\u201d is poised to hit the 50-Test mark next month, is already a British &amp; Irish Lion and helped his club to secure a domestic and European double last season. Dan Carter is the latest to name him as the Lions\u2019 probable starting No10 in New Zealand in June. Most strikingly of all, he is just 25 years old and has the mindset, inner drive and growing maturity to shatter every record out there. When people mention Maro Itoje as England\u2019s potential 2019 World Cup captain, they are arguably discussing the wrong Saracen. The game against the Scarlets on Sunday offers a tantalising glimpse of the next level. Farrell will be captain \u2013 with Itoje in the ranks \u2013 as his side seek to clinch Champions Cup knockout qualification with a round to spare and break Munster\u2019s 10-year-old record with a 14th successive European victory. The Welsh region also happen to be the team against whom the fly-half commenced his senior journey in 2008; he was a mere 17 years and 11 days old when the Sarries coach at the time, Eddie Jones (whatever happened to him?), made him the youngest debutant in English professional rugby history. What strikes you from the old pictures is how ready he looked from the outset. As the son of the all-conquering rugby league legend Andy Farrell, this was perhaps to be expected. Was it inevitable he would also inherit a few of his dad\u2019s leadership genes? \u201cI guess so,\u201d he replies. \u201cAll I can remember is watching my dad play and how he was, not just what he did. You have to be a voice, you have to be able to speak up.\u201d Farrell Jr has captained Sarries a couple of times but, vocally, he has been calling the shots for years. \u201cI was probably not as bossy as I am now but I was loud enough. I didn\u2019t go into my shell. But that\u2019s a tiny part of what it is to try and lead a team around the field. That was the easy bit for me. You just try and develop from there.\u201d As England\u2019s Six Nations season draws near, Farrell is also edging tentatively into other high-profile arenas. Recently, he featured alongside LeBron James, Conor McGregor and Eden Hazard in an advert for a well\u2011known brand of headphones, pumping his chest to the tune of Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes. \u201cI bet everyone\u2019s thinking: \u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019\u201d he says, snorting but sounding genuinely thrilled. \u201cIt is pretty cool to be in it. They are people that you look up to, they are proper superstars.\u201d Alternatively, maybe the next proper English superstar is sitting right here in St Albans, explaining why dwelling on 2016 is a waste of time. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? I don\u2019t feel the need,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I was to sit there and think about anything it would be: \u2018What can you look forward to, what can you put your time into and what can help you grow up?\u2019 Rugby is a game that\u2019s constant. If you are not growing with it you get left behind.\u201d Little Ronnie, one suspects, will not be short of exercise. Apparently he loves chasing balls, which is lucky. No one relishes kicking them more than his owner, to the point where Farrell will challenge himself by \u201cmaking it more of a competition, putting more pressure on yourself so you have to walk away\u201d. For now he seems unscarred by the darker side of obsession. \u201cIt is something I enjoy doing, I feel comfortable when I am doing it. It is tough to do but easy in a way, if you know what I mean. You have to step away if you recognise it\u2019s getting on top of you ... but I know what helps and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d So commences a year that could involve Farrell lining up vital goals against Ireland, his father\u2019s current employers, in Dublin in March. England\u2019s lethal weapon, though, is currently not looking beyond rugby\u2019s stricter tackle sanctions \u2013 \u201cSome people are going to be very unlucky\u201d \u2013 and ensuring a slightly dented Saracens squad do not ease up. And England? \u201cEveryone can always improve. We are No2 in the world and we want to be No1. To do that you\u2019ve got to get consistently better.\u201d It is hardly Wordsworth or Shelley but, in modern rugby, poetry in motion takes a different form."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
