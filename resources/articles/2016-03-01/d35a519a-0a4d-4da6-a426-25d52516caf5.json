Manchester City lead Manchester United by four points so know victory may all but kill off the hopes of their cross-town rivals. Eight matches will remain after the latest edition of the always fiercely contested local squabble. But, in a league campaign of disappointment for Mancunians of both a blue and red hue, thoughts are already turning to strengthening at each club to ensure next season\u2019s challenge is far more convincing. Both squads require major surgery. Conversely, too much churn can damage the dynamics and balance of a playing staff, so the incoming Pep Guardiola and whoever is in charge at United may seek to limit themselves to as few as four major signings. In City\u2019s case, that could be two central defenders, a full-back, and a central midfielder. At United, Van Gaal \u2013 or maybe Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 could be after a striker, a central midfielder, a wide player and a goalkeeper. Once the horse-trading begins a key to how each manager operates may be the futures of their captains. At City\u2019s base, Guardiola\u2019s prime conundrum will be what to do about injury-blighted Vincent Kompany, who suffered a 14th calf injury in Tuesday\u2019s draw with Dynamo Kyiv. Across town at Carrington, Van Gaal or his successor must surely redraw the blueprint for Wayne Rooney, whose days as an effective leader of the attack are numbered. How these questions are resolved will have a significant impact on all the buying and selling. If Guardiola wants to ease Kompany sideways from, say, team captain to club captain and into a reduced playing role, would the Belgian accept this? If not, but he wishes to complete the last three years of a contract worth a basic \u00a3120,000 a week, how might this affect dressing-room morale? The most dramatic solution would be to sell the 29-year-old, but replacing Kompany\u2019s leadership qualities is tricky and Guardiola would have to find two top\u2011line central defenders, as one is already needed: Mart\u00edn Demichelis turned 35 in December and there are doubts over the ability of Eliaquim Mangala and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi. Candidates here include Athletic Bilbao\u2019s Aymeric Laporte and Everton\u2019s John Stones, both 21. Each are young, athletic and can see a pass from the back, qualities important to Guardiola. Laporte has a \u20ac50m (\u00a339m) release clause and the bidding for Stones would be in a similar region. In central midfield, Guardiola may view Yaya Tour\u00e9 as too slow for his high\u2011tempo pressing game. City\u2019s director of football, Txiki Begiristain, recently met the agent of 25-year-old Ilkay Gundongan, who is out of contract at Borussia Dortmund in 2017 and would cost around \u00a325m. A further problem area is full-back. On the left, Ga\u00ebl Clichy and Aleksandar Kolarov are 30, and on the right Pablo Zabaleta and Bacary Sagna are 31 and 33. More significant than age is that none of the four are as gifted technically or defensively as Guardiola would wish. If Kompany does depart, Guardiola may be able to replace only one. The fast, attack-minded Dani Alves, one of his first acquisitions at Barcelona in 2008, is his template for right-back. The 32-year-old\u2019s contract expires in summer 2017 so would cost \u00a310m-\u00a315m. What to do with Kompany and the potential domino effect of any decision appears more of a headache than the question of Rooney at United. His better \u2013 though not perfect \u2013 injury record means he retains a firmer grip on the captaincy and first-team status and to move Rooney from centre-forward to No10 is no demotion. Options to replace Rooney at No9 and offer Anthony Martial competition include Harry Kane and Romelu Lukaku, who are both 22. Or, at the other end of the age scale, is the 34-year-old Zlatan Ibrahimovic, whose Paris Saint-Germain contract expires in July. Kane is contracted to Tottenham until 2020 and would cost no less than \u00a345m. Lukaku\u2019s Everton terms end in 2019 and his price is in a similar bracket. In central midfield Morgan Schneiderlin is yet to convince Van Gaal to give him a regular playing chance and with Bastian Schweinsteiger injury-prone and Michael Carrick 35 in July, a new recruit is required. Gundongan would be a definite upgrade and any move to grab him ahead of City would delight United fans. Such a move may depend on Champions League qualification, however. In the wide positions Memphis Depay and Jesse Lingard are hardly world-class performers who can turn big games. Leicester City\u2019s Riyad Mahrez is. Foxes fans may think United are arrogant if they believe the Algerian would want to leave a club in line to become champions for one that could end sixth. But Mahrez, 24, appears a more realistic purchase than, say, Dortmund\u2019s equally talented Marco Reus who is contracted to 2020. Mahrez\u2019s deal ends in 2019, and his fee would be \u00a325m-plus. Finally, David de Gea could depart for Real Madrid. The Spaniard is United\u2019s\u2019s sole world-class player and finding a suitable successor is a tough ask. Hugo Lloris is Tottenham captain and contracted until 2019. Negotiations for him would start at \u00a325m. Keylor Navas, under contact at Real until 2020, is another option, and he could move the other way as part of any deal for De Gea. The key, though, to any potential business this summer at City and United is the need for a balanced squad and an optimum dynamic between players. As Manuel Pellegrini, City\u2019s current manager, says: \u201cIt is very important to have a balanced squad. You can have a very good team, but the statistics tell you that it is very difficult for you to have the same team playing all the games.\u201d The challenge for Guardiola and whoever is managing United is to arrive at the close of the window on 1 September having vastly improved their respective squads. It will not be easy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
