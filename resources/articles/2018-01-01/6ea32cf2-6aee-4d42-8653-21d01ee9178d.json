Football is football \u2013 everything can change in one minute.\u201d Ben\u00edtez has received assurances from the club\u2019s owner, Mike Ashley, that he will be able to strengthen his relegation-threatened squad before the transfer window\u2019s closure but is waiting for his first signing. \u201cWe have some targets and some names,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to progress.\u201d On Tuesday night sources close to Ashley announced the sports retailer had ended talks with Staveley and accused her of time-wasting, which she has denied. \u201cWhen I was talking with Mike Ashley he told me that the takeover wouldn\u2019t go through,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cI have known this for three weeks. There\u2019s been a lot of speculation about the takeover but he told me it was not going to happen.\u201d More positively, Ben\u00edtez seems cautiously optimistic that Ashley realises the dangers of not reinforcing the team this month and the manager is anxious to do everything in his powers to hold the owner to his promises. \u201cMike said clearly they [Newcastle\u2019s board] will try to do the best they can to bring the players we are looking for,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cThe conversation was positive. Now we need to see the players here. We have to believe we can do what we need to do right up to 31 January. The message was really positive, so we will now see where we are at the end of the window. \u201cThey have the names. We have three or four positions we want to improve. We have to be sure we can get our targets. We have to know the realities of the Premier League. It\u2019s not the same Premier League as two years ago \u2013 we have to be able to compete with those teams who are spending money.\u201d Pressed on whether he could envisage himself working with Ashley in the medium to long term, Ben\u00edtez turned opaque. \u201cIn the future you never know,\u201d he said. \u201cMy future is Manchester City and after that Chelsea and then Burnley and Crystal Palace and so on.\u201d Ben\u00edtez has 18 months left on a contract that includes a clause stipulating he \u2013 or a poaching club \u2013 must pay a \u00a36m compensation fee should he resign before entering the final 12 months of the deal. For the moment, though, he does not appear to be thinking beyond the spring. \u201cFor me, the main thing is to stay in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that happens the future will be bright. I don\u2019t know if anything is close but we have the green light to bring in players. It will be a red light when we get to the end of the transfer window but it\u2019s a green light now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
