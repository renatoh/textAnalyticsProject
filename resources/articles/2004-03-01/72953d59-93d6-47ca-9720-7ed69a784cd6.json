Two bags sitting without owners on platform 17 of Genoa station forced police to evacuate part of the station yesterday. A train was stopped at Asti and courtrooms were evacuated in Turin after anonymous callers threatened more bombs. Railways and airports are bristling with police, sniffer dogs and body-searchers in a knee-jerk security response to the Madrid bomb attacks last week. Suddenly people are looking at the Tower of Pisa, the dome of St Peter's and the hulking remains of the Colosseum and asking themselves, will the terrorists blow this up next? A week after the Madrid bombings, Italy is reportedly considering doubling its 12,000 strong security forces to protect more than 9,000 sites around the country that are deemed to be possible targets for terrorists. Police are preparing security plans for dates such as March 20, the anniversary of the intervention in Iraq; and Easter celebrations early next month. Reports have emerged that around 80 Islamist militants inside Italy are prepared to blow themselves up on Italian soil in the name of the \"holy war\". According to a recent police report, based on tapped telephone conversations, there are Islamist fundamentalists in northern towns across Italy ready to carry out terrorist acts. But so far there has been no firm indication of an imminent attack. Italy has arrested more than 100 suspected Islamist terrorists since September 11 2001, but most have been released for lack of evidence. Investigators fear that those now plotting attacks may slip the net, because without substantial evidence they cannot be detained or deported. The prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has played down the threat to Italy, despite the fact that his country has been a staunch supporter of the US and Britain's intervention in Iraq. Mr Berlsconi, a loyal friend of ousted centre-right Spanish leader Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, insisted this week that Eta may still turn out to have been involved in the Madrid bombings. \"I remain convinced that Aznar was right,\" he told the Corriere della Sera newspaper. \"I am convinced that Eta somehow played a role in the March 11 attacks,\" he said. Anti-war protesters plan to march in cities across Italy tomorrow calling for withdrawal of Italian troops from Iraq. In Italy more than 70% of public opinion was against the attack on Iraq one year ago. But since 19 Italians were killed in the southern Iraqi city of Nassirya last November, a wave of patriotism and a sense of direct threat from terrorism has strengthened public resolve to restore peace in Iraq and defeat global terrorism. Mr Berlusconi has reaffirmed his position alongside Britain in Iraq, where Italy has 2,800 troops and police. \"You don't fight terrorism by going and hiding in a corner,\" he said this week, dismissing speculation that Spain's threat to withdraw from Iraq could trigger a domino effect. \"Anyone who depicts me as having a habit of changing my mind does not know me,\" he said, according to Corriere della Sera. \"I am always on one path, the same path. We have guaranteed our support as loyal allies. We have taken our share of the responsibility. What else should a country that is among the seven or eight world powers do?\" If necessary, he said this week, a lot more money can be found to protect every corner of Italy from the terrorists in its midst. \"I have in a drawer a law prepared by the economy minister which can immediately be made operational,\" he said yesterday. The government may boost its security budget from the planned \u20ac125m this year to as much as \u20ac450m, according to newspaper reports. While Europe hammers out hasty plans to strengthen its anti-terrorism measures, analysts say Mr Berlusconi now risks being politically isolated for sticking by his US and British allies. \"Aznar has left behind many orphans, starting with Silvio Berlusconi, whom he helped join the European Popular party, giving him European legitimacy and with whom he was allied in recent years as far as foreign affairs,\" said the economic daily Il Sole 24 Ore this week. \"It is obvious that the [political] earthquake in Spain could increasingly sideline Italy in the Europe that matters and makes decisions.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
