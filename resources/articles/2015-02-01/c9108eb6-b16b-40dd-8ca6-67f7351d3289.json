He was all handshakes and convivial small talk about the south of France and after some reminiscing he wished them a good evening out in London. \u201cI would like to give you some tips but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said, an admission of how he still isn\u2019t any sort of man about town after all these years. The vignette offered a reminder of how absorbed he has always been about management. During his 18 years living in London it has become a running joke that he knows his way between only three places \u2013 his home, the training ground and the stadium. That kind of focus was evident as he tried to reject the romantic idea that Arsenal versus Monaco is the match of his footballing life. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he shrugged, as if a last-16 tie could not possibly be a particular high point in his career. \u201cOur job is all about tomorrow and the future.\u201d However, it is the match of his life in a broader context because it brings together the two most important clubs of his career, clubs that shaped him, that gave him the ingredients to strive for success. For all the experience he gathered as a rookie with Nancy for three years and during an 18-month spell in faraway Nagoya with Grampus Eight, together Monaco and Arsenal account for 25 of the 30-odd years he has been preparing and picking football teams professionally. \u201cIf I look at the history of my life these are the two who have been crazy enough to let me work,\u201d he said. \u201cThe two of them had to be brave because it wasn\u2019t obvious for Monaco to take me on or for Arsenal to employ me. I have a lot of respect for that.\u201d When quizzed about his longevity in building these clubs he responded: \u201cI am a fan of marathons.\u201d The next kilometre, he added, is always the most difficult. This is a worlds colliding moment for Wenger. He allowed himself a hint of nostalgia as he recounted his old life in Ligue 1. He recalled the view along the Moyenne Corniche on the approach to the Stade Louis II and even drily remembered the joys of life on the road in French football. \u201cThe Novotel in Brest and in Lille and in Sochaux \u2026 They used to smilewhen I arrived.\u201d The mark he left on the club was massive. Wenger won the title with Monaco in their first season together and guided them to their first European final. It was a nightmare, though, as French football was reeling from tragedy. Wenger describes the eve of the 1992 Cup Winners Cup final against Werder Bremen as \u201ca haunting night\u201d. When a terrace collapsed during a Bastia-Marseille game, 18 supporters were killed in Corsica. \u201cWe did not sleep. It was catastrophic,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe were all appalled at the hotel. It was not a preparation for a European final.\u201d Monaco lost 2-0. The relationship between Wenger and Monaco was strong enough to withstand the fact they sacked him in 1994, a few months after reaching the Champions League semi-final. \u201cI survived,\u201d he says now. \u201cI have no regrets because that\u2019s how I am and that\u2019s how I will be as long as I\u2019m alive.\u201d He has spent time with various Monaco representatives in recent seasons. As the longest-serving manager in the club\u2019s history, he has always remained open to offering advice and opinions. Vadim Vasilyev, the adviser to Monaco\u2019s Russian owner Dmitry Rybolovlev, visited the Frenchman in London on a few occasions. \u201cThey came to see me to ask me what I thought of the club,\u201d Wenger said. It is not just the club Wenger knows well. The team, and their particular characteristics, present a challenge that means he will not take this tie any less seriously than the string of favourites Arsenal have faltered against in recent seasons (Bayern Munich twice, Milan and Barcelona). \u201cEasy is a word that you have to ban in the Champions League,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThey are efficient and physically powerful. That helps them to stay in matches when they are under pressure. Monaco are like a reptile. They will wait for us and absorb the game ready to kill us.\u201d Wenger has calculated that conceding an early goal in the home legs has been a repetitive syndrome recently. Arsenal may well begin cautiously, intent not to give themselves another mountain to climb. But he senses a different atmosphere around the club this time. Arsenal are in strong form, having won nine games on the trot at home, and are not suffering from too many injuries (whereas Monaco are missing some key players). Wenger thinks his team are much readier than before to progress in the competition. \u201cI believe we are in a better shape. I am convinced of that. We feel as a team that we are on the way up and we can use the Champions League to confirm that. I look around Europe today and there are 10 teams who believe they can win it.\u201d Wenger desperately wants to negotiate this last-16 hurdle after a succession of disappointments at this stage of the Champions League. A good night on the town for his Mon\u00e9gasque friends, followed by a chastening one at the Emirates Stadium, would suit him just fine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
