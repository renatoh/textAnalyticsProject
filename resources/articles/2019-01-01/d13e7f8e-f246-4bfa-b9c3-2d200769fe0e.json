David Beckham\u2019s corner, Teddy Sheringham\u2019s flick and, well, you know the rest. What has remained a secret until now was that up in the Camp Nou directors\u2019 box \u2013 following an outrageous piece of blagging \u2013 was Mauricio Pochettino. And when Solskj\u00e6r did what he did, to win the 1999 Champions League final against Bayern Munich, Pochettino found himself celebrating as crazily as any United fan. The way the Tottenham manager tells it, he was simply carried along by the emotion of the moment. Pochettino was an Espanyol player at the time and, together with his teammate, Toni Jim\u00e9nez \u2013 who is now the goalkeeper coach at Spurs \u2013 he had watched the first half from seats that were not so great. And so he and his partner-in-crime decided to upgrade. They were on the same level as the VIP area and they hopped from block to block until they got there. Remarkably, they spied two padded seats that were empty, jumped into them and, even more remarkably, they were not moved on. \u201cWe sat, like this,\u201d Pochettino says, making like the meekest of boys. \u201cThen, the second half started and we watched it from there \u2013 the presidents\u2019 [area]. When Sheringham scored for 1-1 in the last minute, we said: 'Wow, amazing game, now injury-time.' And then when Solskj\u00e6r scored, we were celebrating. How I shouted for a Manchester United goal was incredible! I don\u2019t know why because in that moment, we were neutral. But the atmosphere was amazing.\u201d It is a story that resonates particularly loudly because on Sunday at Wembley, Pochettino\u2019s Spurs take on a United team that has been re-energised under the caretaker management of Solskj\u00e6r. And, of course, there is the small matter of who may be given the United job on a permanent basis in the summer. Could it yet be Solskj\u00e6r, who has won his first five matches \u2013 albeit against low-ranking opposition \u2013 but, perhaps more importantly, has reacquainted United with a sense of adventure and fun? The Spurs game is his first major test. Were he to triumph, it would certainly help his case. Or could it be Pochettino, whom United and Sir Alex Ferguson have in their sights? Ferguson, now back to health and influence, had advanced Pochettino\u2019s candidacy in 2016, post Louis van Gaal, only for the Glazers to prefer the surer thing of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Pochettino wears his vanity more appealingly than Mourinho these days and since the Old Trafford sacking of a man that he counts as a friend, he has been cute, playful and frankly mischievous at various times with regard to the stories linking him with United at the end of the season. It is a soap opera that promises to run and run, although Pochettino played it straight for a change on Friday at his pre-match press conference when he stressed that Premier League points were the only thing on his mind. He looked positively flabbergasted when asked whether his players had joked with him about the United job. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are too respectful.\u201d There has been the temptation to bill the game as Pochettino versus Solskj\u00e6r, with the winner taking all, but that is not only glib, it is incorrect. It is so for several reasons and the biggest one is a man called Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman who, if United come calling for Pochettino, will make it unbelievably difficult for them to take him. There was a time when United would have who they wanted from Spurs \u2013 Sheringham, Michael Carrick, Dimitar Berbatov, even if the latter\u2019s move came after tortuous negotiations. Ferguson infamously described the business of dealing with Levy as \u201cmore painful than my hip replacement\u201d. There has since been a shift in the relationship between the clubs and not only because Spurs finished above United in 2014, 2016 and 2017. As Pochettino noted, the economic landscape of the Premier League has shifted, making all of the clubs more financially powerful and able to resist unwanted overtures from the bigger ones. Levy has long been a nightmare to deal with but now it can be close to impossible. United, for example, wanted to take Eric Dier from Spurs in 2017. There was never any possibility of Levy sanctioning the departure of a player he wanted to keep. \u201cDaniel is, as you know very well, so tough to negotiate with,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cFor different clubs in England to do business with him, it\u2019s so difficult.\u201d Pochettino, unusually, does not have an agent and he negotiated the new five-year contract he signed last May directly with Levy. Not unusually, he thought that he did a good job. \u201cFor me, if there was one person that was easy to do business with, it was Daniel,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI think it was more difficult for him than me because I am the manager and he cannot upset me.\u201d If United or Real Madrid were to try to take Pochettino in the summer, it is likely that the dynamics of any negotiation between him and Levy would be different. In Levy\u2019s favour would be the length of Pochettino\u2019s contract and, crucially, the absence of a buyout clause in it. As recent history has shown, Tottenham talent does not get away from Levy without a fight or, in some instances, by playing an ugly game of brinkmanship. Just ask Berbatov. Or Luka Modric and Gareth Bale. If Pochettino does want a new challenge, he may have to ask himself just how hard he is prepared to push for it. Levy has been here before with some of his players and, although it would be a new experience with a manager, he would approach it with trademark iron fists. Ferguson knows this better than anyone. He did not try to sign Modric, even though he liked him, because he could not face dealing with Levy again. Pochettino versus Solskj\u00e6r? There is a third player in the game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
