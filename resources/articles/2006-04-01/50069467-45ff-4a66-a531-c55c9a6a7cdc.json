Tracey's jangly unaccompanied intro to Perdido, his off-handedly compassionate delivery of For All We Know (with Andy Cleyndert's warm bass sound enfolding him), and the peremptory firebell sound of Little Rootie Tootie's chords against Clark Tracey's close-marking cymbals drive home the case for the pianist's late-period work representing some of his most freewheeling playing. Tracey plays a tom-tom intro initially reminiscent of Max Roach's for Sonny Rollins's St Thomas before arriving in stealthy doodles on See Meenah Latino (the only original). Willow Weep for Me keeps trying to avoid its theme, and Duke Ellington's swinger Great Times is a classic Tracey uptempo vehicle. One of the great British jazz stories rumbles triumphantly on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
