That at least is the accusation made by Alex Eckelberry, chief executive of Sunbelt Software, which makes antispyware products. \"It's bad enough that Microsoft is getting in to all aspects of security. But now they are going to kill their competition through predatory pricing,\" he wrote on a blog posting (http://tinyurl.com/l9e6v). The source of his annoyance: the pricing schemes for Microsoft OneCare, the security suite that Microsoft will offer for $49.95 (\u00a327) for up to three machines, undercuts competitors such as Norton Antivirus and McAfee VirusScan by 44% and 29% respectively. On the enterprise side, which Eckelberry says is the most profitable, Microsoft's Antigen product comes out (under different scenarios) at between 53% and 63% cheaper than rivals such as Trend, Symantec and McAfee. Are companies like Symantec worried? We met Enrique Salem, head of Symantec's consumer division, at about the time Eckelberry was composing his blog post. Salem appeared unworried by the threat: \"OneCare's capabilities aren't anything new,\" he said. \"They're working on threats that we used to focus on previously.\" Symantec, he said, was looking forward to the world as it will be, when almost every user will be online all the time, and will routinely expect that spyware, viruses, keyloggers and Trojans will be kept off their computer. The problem then, suggests Salem, will be in knowing what sites you can trust as phishing and \"poisoned\" sites (which might carry malware in adverts or downloaded software) grow. To deal with that, Symantec is building a cooperative product in which the users themselves will rate sites for trustworthiness; that will automatically and anonymously be reported back to a central system that will make the recommendation (or lack of it) available to any other Symantec user. If that sounds like the sort of thing a search engine such as Google or Yahoo might find useful, it is. Salem wouldn't say whether Symantec has tied up a deal with a search engine (clearly, it won't do it with Microsoft). But it may be indicative that it has previously signed a deal in the UK with Yahoo. Of OneCare, Salem said: \"I'm not saying that Microsoft isn't going to run fast [in updating its security offerings].\" But, he suggested, Symantec is going to make sure it runs faster to keep ahead. Salem did not respond to subsequent requests for comment about Eckelberry's posting. A Microsoft spokesman said: \"We believe that Windows Live OneCare and Microsoft Antigen products provide good value to customers and that all firms should compete to provide good value. Our customers have made it clear that malicious software and other internet threats represent a major problem and they want Microsoft to deliver effective solutions. \"Microsoft believes that customers want the freedom to choose the security solutions that work best for them and we're committed to seeing the sector stay competitive, with a large, thriving ecosystem of innovative companies.\" But Eckelberry is worried for the whole sector. \"It's one thing that Microsoft has destroyed competition in browsers, languages, word processors, spreadsheets, presentation packages, and all the rest ... But it's another thing to kill competition in the security space. Because the security landscape has changed. \"There is now a tremendous incentive to hack Windows, because there's just so much money to be made by the bad guys. It's free market economics - energy goes where there is a profit. So Vista will get hacked, there will be zero-day attacks, there will be evolving forms of viruses and malware. And Microsoft security products will be targeted. In a world where Microsoft has a hegemony on security, the implications may be far reaching, possibly to our own national security.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
