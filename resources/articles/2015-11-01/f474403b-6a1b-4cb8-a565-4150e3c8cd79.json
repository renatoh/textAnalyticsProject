Earlier this year they delivered an album of four tracks, each 10min 10secs long, stretching out into trippiness. Now they\u2019re exploring pastoral psych pop \u2013 only one track here passes four minutes, and you\u2019ll hunt in vain for viciously fuzzed guitars: it\u2019s all flutes, acoustics and mellowness here.

For all that it sounds like pastiche \u2013 1968 as reimagined by people looking at a book of colourised photographs, right down to the sitar on NGRI (Bloodstain) \u2013 Paper M\u00e2ch\u00e9 Dream Balloon is a joy, because King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard are terrific songwriters, out of whom melodies tumble incessantly. They couldn\u2019t have more perfectly captured the moment when psychedelia renounced noise if they\u2019d called the album Getting Our Heads Together in the Country, Man."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
