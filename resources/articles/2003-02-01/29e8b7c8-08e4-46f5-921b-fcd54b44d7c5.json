In it, Dario Fo exposes police corruption and brutality, the connivance of the media, the megalomania of the judiciary, class privilege, the absurdity of piecemeal social reform and the state's tendency to promote subversion on the quiet for its own ends. Not bad for a riotous farce. Ray Cooney should be so lucky. I have just translated the play for a production at London's Donmar Warehouse, which in translating circles qualifies as \"a nice job\" (I've translated Italian VAT paperwork in my time and believe me, there's no comparison). Just as you feel a longueur coming on, a very good joke swings by; just as the central character's acid sarcasm starts to corrode your spirit, there is a calmly persuasive speech that makes you regret your years of political disengagement. Fo, now in his 70s, has no real equivalent in this country. As a performer, he might be Tommy Cooper after attending a summer school in commedia del'arte. As a playwright, think David Hare after a prolonged course of amphetamines. He won the Nobel prize in 1997 - a useful gong, not only if you want to get into Stockholm's best restaurants at short notice, but also to subdue critics who regard essentially comic playwrights, even angry ones, as a bit lightweight. But in 1970, when Fo wrote Accidental Death as an enraged response to the fall of an anarchist railway worker from the fourth-floor window of Milan's police headquarters, many were surprised that the play found an audience outside Italy. The most celebrated production in Britain was the original 1979 version by the Belt and Braces company at the Half Moon Theatre, which transferred to the West End and played there for what seemed like years. Not so much a translation, more a rumbustious approximation, it was a crowd-pleasing rollercoaster. These days Fo isn't quite as keen on the (as it were) circus-isation of his work, so the Donmar's and my own more radical ideas were vetoed. I still passionately believe that a mime version set in war-torn Guernsey would have worked, but theatre folk can be very cautious. At the suggestion of the director, Robert Delamere, we have relocated the play to contemporary Britain. After all, the original events happened 35 years ago, several countries away, and there are references to Italian senior policemen of the period that even members of the Milan branch of Amnesty International wouldn't get now without footnotes. Not only that, but if you leave the play in its original setting, there is a risk that the evening gets caught between satirising and paying tribute to the Italian fashions of the late 1960s. The play is about the murder of an innocent man, not how amusing bushy sideburns and large Sophia Loren-style glasses now look. The vanity and swagger of the Italian carabinieri, visibly delighting in their pristine uniforms, has always been shocking. The British police have a less sensual relationship with their uniforms - and looking at that hat, you can see why. I've never seen a copper lovingly picking specks of dust off his jacket. Nor have I ever seen a British policeman in sunglasses, whereas I imagine they're still pretty damn de rigueur down the Appian Way. Italian police also invariably carry a gun, which gives you that special edge if you're serious about your swaggering. In some respects, Accidental Death remains intensely Italian. Italy was energetically political when I lived there at the end of the 1970s. People really did gather at street corners to talk politics. The country had a fault line running down it: massive Communist party membership on one side, Christian Democrats hanging anxiously on to power on the other, all watched over beadily by a conservative Pope from a communist country. Paranoia was in the air and it obviously extended to the Italian police force. But like all modern classics, Fo's play has all sorts of contemporary resonances. Terrorism, for one. Italian cities were alive with home-grown terrorist activity in 1969. You thought twice before you went out shopping: if the fascist or ultra-left bombs did not get you, back then in Milan and Rome and Bologna, then an anarchist one would. Admittedly, some of this \"terror\" was risible. Fo brilliantly mocks the disorganised nature of much of the anarchist threat: after all, a hyper-efficient anarchist machine doesn't seem quite right. The subject of media manipulation, too, is even more relevant now than it was in 1970. (Unless, of course, I've just been manipulated into believing that.) Accidental Death features a journalist whose investigative skills are perverted by her need for a scandal. The original version of the play (Fo has reworked it several times) ends with a broadside against our obsession with scandal, how it distracts us from the world's real iniquities. We've only got so much energy to change the world before anger-fatigue sets in, so let's not waste it picking over Cherie Blair's dealings with a \"convicted fraudster\". Although, come to think about it, that might make a good play. Nor have police brutality and cover-ups ever gone away. I must confess that my own animosity levels towards the agents of law enforcement are rather low; I personally have had more brutal treatment at the hands of doctors' receptionists or TV producers than the police. This no doubt has something to do with the fact that I am white, middle class and not affiliated to any of the political groupings that traditionally get up the police's nose, such as animal rights organisations, anarchist cells or the little-known Comedy Writers Against Policemen (more work needed on that acronym). But, as any right-thinking chief constable would agree, it is a vital function of theatre, indeed art and entertainment generally, that figures of authority should occasionally be ridiculed. And Fo ridicules. Of course, the risk of satirising dubious police officers on stage is that they come across as merely buffoonish, rather than the kind of men who would beat someone to death in a cell or push an innocent man out of a window. The officers in Accidental Death need to generate laughter, but also fear. It is ironic, to say the least, that the audience at the Donmar will be mainly middle-class theatregoers - many with expensive burglar alarm systems wired to police stations - who are paying to watch the dissection and humiliation of the police on stage. The same people whooped and cheered as Michael Moore, in his recent one-man show, cut up people's loyalty cards and urged everyone watching to do the same. Mixed emotions at breakfast the next morning as audience members quietly applied for replacement cards. But that is a reason to put Fo's play on, rather than the opposite. His plays don't bother to coax the average Daily Mail reader across the political divide. What they do offer is the theatrical equivalent of being laughed into bed. I suspect that many right-wing punters went to see Can't Pay? Won't Pay!, Fo's other big hit in this country, thinking they were going to see a drama about consumer rights in today's service economy. Fo's work can be uncomfortable. He can make you laugh, then make you feel foolish for laughing. His mouthpiece in Accidental Death, the Maniac, explicitly urges revolutionary action, criticising a society that thinks it can reform itself back to health, like taking Lemsip for pancreatitis. You can try to watch the plays dispassionately as polemics, but you're unlikely to get away with it. Despite Michael Billington's review of the Half Moon production - \"a marvellous concept: a zany political farce\" - Fo's play didn't lead to a host of imitations. Alistair Beaton's recent Feelgood was a farce about politics but not a political farce. There have been plays about the Stephen Lawrence case, but nobody has tried to turn the events into a \"zany political farce\", which is probably just as well. The truth is, it's a hard trick to pull off, and not just because of our libel laws. Accidental Death of an Anarchist reminds us that laughter and anger are not necessarily incompatible. \u00b7 Accidental Death of an Anarchist is in preview at the Donmar Warehouse, London WC2, from tonight.
