Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 The White House and Congressional Republicans vowed to \"keep talking\" to find a solution to the government shutdown and looming debt ceiling. \u2022 The negotiations appeared to be active but not without turbulence. The White House said talks were \"constructive.\" Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said the talks were useful. House speaker John Boehner spoke with President Obama on the phone late Friday. \u2022 The day of talks followed 10 days of reciprocating taunts in dueling news conferences. The sides are making more conciliatory noises. \u2022 The White House said it did not want a short-term deal to raise the debt ceiling, which it said would risk a government paralysis redux falling during the busy holiday shopping season, when consumer confidence is extra-important. \u2022 Senate Republicans appeared to be working on a budget deal that would target a tax on medical devices that partially funds Obamacare. House Republicans were working on separate legislation. \u2022 The White House left open the possibility of signing a short-term debt limit extension separate from any broader budget deal. The presidential spokesman called on Congress to pass legislation to reopen the government as soon as possible. And to take you into your weekend, a dispatch from the fringe: Not everyone is reading from the same playbook here. The quote is in a National Journal story the ink's still drying on. Carney's out. The Guardian's Amanda Holpuch (@holpuch) tries out the Drunk Dial Congress web site \u2013 and hijinks ensue: At 1pm on Friday \u2013 sober \u2013 I tested the service. It connected me to the Michigan Republican Mike Rogers' office twice, to three other Republican offices and to one Democrat. When I could not come up with a local zip code to mark my complaint, each of the employees recommended I contact my local representative. The office of the South Carolina Republican Mick Mulvaney also said I could call Mulvaney's DC office, which is handling shutdown complaints. A representative at the office of the Missouri Democrat Emanuel Cleaver told me she was not familiar with the Drunk Dial Congress website but understood why any individual would be upset with the shutdown. \"We're watching just like you,\" she said. Read the full piece here. Carney characterizes the House Republican conferences as \"a diverse bunch with sometimes conflicting opinions about policy and the president.\" He said while the White House invited all House Republicans over on Thursday and \"regretted that all members of the House weren't able to the come,\" the meeting \"with that leadership subset... was constructive and we believe it is the right thing to do to continue talks.\" Carney says he's open to changes in Obamacare but not to wolf-in-sheeps-clothing attempts to cripple it: The president has said I think publicly many times that he is open to suggestions from any quarter about how to improve the Affordable Care Act... he understands that with any kind of program like this.. there are ways to improve it. He doesn't doubt it. What he of course won't accept is efforts to do away with the ACA that come in the guise of improvements. Carney is asked about Senator Collins' proposal. His nonspecific reply: I would say that a number of lawmakers in the Senate as well as the house have expressed views that are constructive from our perspective. Senator Collins is one of them. Q: Are you negotiating? Didn't you say you weren't going to negotiate until the shutdown ends? A: \"Our position hasn't changed... There is no ransom that can be paid. ... When it comes to raising the debt ceiling.\" Carney says the media can call the current talks and exchanges of proposals anything they want. So let's call it a negotiation. \"We're listening and we're talking,\" Carney says. Q: Can you give the White House version of events about the Ted Cruz back-and-forth? A: No. I don't have any further readout on what the president thought was a constructive meeting. NBC's Chuck Todd said he heard Cruz said something \"impassioned\" about health care and the president was \"dismissive\" in his response. Carney is asked what, exactly, the White House is offering Republicans to get them to say nice things, as they have, about the ongoing negotiations. Carney says Obama is seeking budget compromise: I think the conversations... have reinforced... that [Obama] is serious about finding compromise when it comes to our budget challenges. Carney returns to the debt ceiling: \"The president is absolutely committed to the proposition that the American people cannot pay ransom to Congress for doing its job.\" When it comes to the debt ceiling... it is absolutely his view that demands for aransom of any kind, any kind of extraction of a concession ... are unacceptable. Carney suggests that the ongoing talks include budget items that might be cut to take the place of sequester cuts. This is just the nature of negotiations that has been reported today. Carney refers to \"reforms that were discussed today.\" \"The fact that there's broad interest in both parties in buying back the sequester is a good thing,\" he says. Carney says the White House is \"interested\" in exploring options for replacing the sequester. He repeats: \"It's very important to remove the threat of default.\" Carney says \"it's not reasonable to pursue budget negotiations under threat of default.\" He said a six-week debt limit extension would risk a repetition of the current crisis and that it would fall during the crucial holiday retail period. Sounds like the short-term debt limit extension is off the table, as least as far as the White House is concerned. Carney says the shutdown should end because there's no reason for it: There's no reason I have seen logically articulated by Republicans ... why they would insist on continuing to keep the shutdown. Carney repeats the word \"constructive\" and the White House impression that Republicans have changed their tune. We think that talks have been constructive and we think that Republican leaders are looking for a way to extend the debt ceiling and to fund the government. They need to continue talking... Carney says the White House wants to see the threat of default go away for good: There is a recognition that default is not an acceptable outcome, and not an option. [...] We should remove extension of the debt ceiling from this conversation. The threat of default should not be part of negotiations. Question: Is it your sense that Republicans have backed down? Carney's not biting: I would just say... that it's not really how it should be viewed, that it's a win-lose, zero-sum competition, because there are losers, regardless, in a process like this where government is shut down and default is threatened. And the president wants that dynamic to change. The tone of today's White House briefing is a 180-degree turn from the last two weeks. Carney is voicing a conciliatory stance instead of an adversarial stance. You guys want to turn this into a game of winners and losers... [but] in a situation where the government is shut down and one party of Congress is threatening default... nobody wins. [Obama] wants a situation where we can discuss and debate our differences\" in which \"both sides can compromise.\" Carney says the Republicans have changed their tune: There are indications in these last 24 hours from Republicans of a new willingness to explore this possibility. Carney again describes a problem the White House has with yesterday's GOP \"offer\" to walk the debt ceiling out till 20 November: \"Tying the extension of the debt ceiling for only six weeks to budget negotiations\" creates a situation very similar to the one we're in now, Carney says. The president believes \"that's not the way to go.\" Carney says a temporary debt limit extension is \"the very least\" Congress can do: It is the very least that Congress could do to pass legislation that would raise the debt ceiling for the short term... and pass legislation that would fund the government for a short term. The president wants to raise the debt ceiling \"for longer than that,\" Carney says. Obama wants budget negotiations but not under \"the dynamic that led to where we are now.\" Then Carney seems to signal a rejection of a short-term debt limit extension in the context of budget negotiations \u2013 just the kind of negotiations that seem to be happening. The president \"appreciates the constructive approach that we've been seeing, and that certainly is a change and a welcome change,\" Carney says. But: We cannot have a situation where the debt ceiling is extended as part of a budget negotiation process that would put us back in the same position that we're in now. Carney describes the Boehner-Obama call and hails \"constructive\" talks with Republicans: The president did call and speak with [Boehner] not long ago, had a good conversation, and the two of them agreed that all sides need to keep talking... on the issues confronting us. ... The president believes that [meetings with GOP] have been constructive talks, and in meetings with House Republicans in particular... Carny says the White House welcomed the \"indication that we need to move default as a [threat]... default itself is never an option\": The president appreciates the constructive nature of the conversation and the proposal the Republicans put forward. He won't specify what \"proposal.\" Carney is in the house. \"Thank you for your patience. It's obviously been a long afternoon.\" Talks were held on planned talks: Two minutes till Carney. The District of Columbia apparently runs out of money to fund its lottery (isn't the whole point of a lottery to take in more money than you pay out?) and the shutdown rolls on. The 1pm 2.45pm ET briefing with Jay Carney is \"beginning shortly,\" the White House web site has said for the last half hour. President Obama expressed interest in Senator Susan Collins' plan to cut a tax on medical devices that partially funds Obamacare, replacing the revenues from elsewhere, but the president \"did not endorse\" the plan, Collins told Reuters: \"He obviously did not agree with my descriptions of the negative impact of the tax. But he clearly also recognizes that it is not the heart of Obamacare in any way, and that as long as the revenue is replaced, as I proposed, that it does not hurt his signature program,\" said Collins, who is from Maine. A deal that included a cut of some kind to Obamacare would allow Republicans who have focused on the law to claim a measure of victory. White House spokesman Jay Carney is expected to speak momentarily \u2013 which is what we said more than two hours ago. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Republicans gave mixed reviews to a White House meeting with the president. They reported substantive negotiations but saw a \"difficult experience\" ahead. \u2022 The negotiations reportedly extended beyond resolutions to the shutdown and debt limit crises to encompass broader budget issues such as the sequester, taxes, Medicare and possibly more. \u2022 Two separate legislative trajectories developed, one in the House and one in the Senate, where Susan Collins was trying to put together a deal that would cut a tax on medical devices among other steps. \u2022 At least two senators, Lindsey Graham and Rob Portman, said the real action was in the House, which appeared ready to plunge into another weekend of work. \u2022 There was grumbling in the hard-right faction of the House about abandoning the fight against Obamacare that indicated why speaker John Boehner may have difficulty delivering on a deal. House of Representatives staff members have been told not to expect a vote today on a spending bill to reopen government or on legislation to raise the debt ceiling, according to Congressional Quartery-Roll Call: (via @robertcostaNR) Oh good. Additional reaction from senators who attended the White House meeting with the president. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said the session was useful and that Republicans are working on trying to come up with a bipartisan solution to the budget stalemate, AP reported. Senator Orrin Hatch, the ranking member of the finance committee, said Obama brought up \"new revenues,\" meaning taxes, and Obama expressed concern about the duration of the House Republican debt limit plan, Reuters reported. Hatch said he felt the fiscal fight will still be a \"difficult experience.\" \"There was talks about everything,\" Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, a member of the appropriations committee, told Reuters. \"That was constructive. But there was no resolution\" of differences over raising the debt limit and ending the 11-day shutdown. The White House is seemingly not ready to characterize the current negotiations. Press secretary Jay Carney's daily briefing has been pushed back from a scheduled start of 1pm to 2.45pm ET. Resentment among federal employees forced to work without timely pay is growing, Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) reports: Government employees forced to work with no pay during the US government shutdown are being treated like \u201cindentured servants\u201d, the head of their largest union said on Friday. \u201cAt one point in our country\u2019s history we had legal slavery in this country,\u201d Jeffrey David Cox, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), told the Guardian. \u201cThis is indentured servitude.\u201d Cox said nearly half of his 670,000 members had been deemed \u201cessential workers\u201d and had thus been compelled to keep working without pay while the shutdown continues. Workers who do not turn up for their jobs face disciplinary action and could be fired. Read the full piece here. More reactions from the senators after their White house meeting: \"jelling,\" \"back at work,\" \"finally negotiating\": (and #ff Cox Radio's Congress correspondent @jamiedupree): \"We're a long way\" from an agreement, Senator John McCain told reporters after returning from the White House, the Huffington Post reports. Sen. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has called for a repeal of a tax on medical devices that partially pays for Obamacare and for a modification of the sequester. UPDATE from @sabrinasiddiqui: Sen. Collins says Obama found her proposal \"constructive ... There were elements he liked but I wouldn't say he endorsed it.\" Another meeting attendee, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, tells the Omaha World-Herald the meeting was \"pleasant\": The meeting's over. Watch your step. The debt ceiling fight is driving up banks' overnight borrowing costs and roiling the market for bonds maturing after Thanksgiving, Reuters reports: Banks and investors have shied away from holding debt that is at any risk of delayed interest or principal payments, and that has had a notable effect on short-dated Treasury debt. The possibility that the debt ceiling battle will be put off for several weeks caused yields on Treasury bills maturing late in October to fall modestly. Instead, traders started to price in additional risk for bills maturing in late November and throughout December. For example, the bills maturing on December 19 now yield 0.205 percent, up from 0.115 percent on Thursday, whereas those bills maturing in January yield about 0.07 to 0.08 percent. [...] In addition, overnight borrowing costs for banks in the $5 trillion repurchase market - which funds day-to-day operations for banks on Wall Street - remain elevated on concern that a default could ripple through key funding markets. Meanwhile forecasters are predicting slower economic growth as a result of the shutdown, the Wall Street Journal reports: Macroeconomic Advisers cut 0.2 percentage points off its fourth quarter gross domestic product growth projection, which is now at a 1.9% annual pace. The firm expects government spending to contract at 2.0% pace during the quarter, a deeper pull back than the 0.7% previously forecast The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up almost 100 points or .6% on the day. Everybody's workin for the weekend: Overheard in the House Republican caucus: Huelskamp has been in Congress almost three years and holds a fancy PhD. The AP elaborates on its headline news that a budget deal is taking shape. An AP report cites unnamed \"senior administration officials.\" The gist of the deal: \"replacing\" some sequester cuts with Medicare cuts achieved through means-testing. Is that it? Likely not. It's what's being reported for now. How do you \"replace\" a cut? Sequestration, which went into effect in March, automatically cut the budget by about $1.2tn through 2021. The Republicans would like to keep the overall smaller size of the trimmed-down budget, but they want to change what's been cut. The big problem with sequestration was that it gave the entire budget an indiscriminate haircut. That included cuts to defense spending by an estimated $55 billion over seven months. The GOP would like to, among other things, reinstate higher levels of defense spending, and \"replace\" the savings with cuts to Medicare. In previous negotiations the president has signaled his willingness to accept Medicare means-testing. So there may be grounds for a deal. White House spokesman Jay Carney is scheduled to begin a daily briefing within the hour. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Senate Republicans are meeting with the president at the White House. Whispers of a deal are in the air. \u2022 House Republicans spoke of the need to pass a resolution to fund government and give up for now their war on Obamacare. No such talk has yet been heard in the shutdown's 11 days. \u2022 Rep. Paul Ryan is said to be in the thick of the current negotiations. Here's his own description, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier this week, of what Republicans might be looking for (hint: Ryan does not mention the Affordable Care Act). No votes are scheduled in the House today (see update below). But it's open. They could ramp up any time. In the Senate, majority leader Harry Reid moved Thursday evening to vote on a bill to extend the debt ceiling until the end of 2014. That legislation, or a version of it, could work its way into a broad agreement between the sides, although Republicans have rejected the idea of adding so much headroom. The headroom, lest anyone needs reminding, is currently running out fast: Update: the House has voted to pass another mini spending bill. Fourteen government programs down, fourteen thousand to go. What's a \"spending cut\"? The Republicans have arrived to the White House, CBS News reports. The White House has said repeatedly that the president will not enter budget negotiations until Congress reopens the government. Those negotiations now appear to be happening. The question is, if a deal emerges, will it require Republicans to pass the stopgap spending bill the Senate passed on 27 September with no add-ons pertaining to Obamacare or anything else \u2013 \"clean,\" as they say? And what will the Republicans require in return for doing so? \"We need to get something for the [continuing resolution] and something for the debt ceiling,\" Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho has explained. One of the leaders of the negotiations on the Republican side is Paul Ryan, the former vice presidential candidate and reputed budget wonk. \"Suddenly a man who seemed in danger of being eclipsed as the face of his party has re-emerged as essential to its rescue,\" New York Times congressional reporter Jonathan Weisman writes. So what does Ryan want? Ryan laid out areas for negotiation in a Wall Street Journal editorial Tuesday. They are Medicare (means-testing for relatively affluent recipients); federal pensions (cutting them) and taxes. He also alluded to the Keystone pipeline which would connect Canada \"tar sands\" oil deposits to the Gulf coast with dire environmental implications. Ryan did not mention Obamacare, significantly, meaning a plan he brokers could encounter resistance from the hard-right House faction for whom destroying the law is a top priority. The health care law is partially paid for by a tax on medical devices. The deletion of the tax as part of a deal would allow the Tea Party to claim it had dealt the law a blow. Democrats have been insisting all week that even a \"clean\" stopgap spending bill is not great for Democrats because it extrapolates from base spending levels that take into account the \"meat-cleaver\" sequester cuts. When sequestration becomes part of the new normal, there's an argument to be made that the Republicans have won, no matter how bad their numbers are. The chairman of the House appropriations committee said Republicans will test the president on his vow only to cut a budget deal on the condition that government reopens, Bloomberg Business week reports (via @robertcostaNRO): Obama \u201cwould like the shutdown stopped,\u201d Representative Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, said after the White House session. \u201cWe are trying to find out what it is he would insist upon\u201d in a spending measure to open the government. What will they get? Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts says Senator Ted Cruz, the grandstanding outspoken Tea Party standard-bearer, will be among Senate Republicans attending today's meeting with the president. Invited to horse-trade with the president. Not bad for someone who's only held national elected office for 10 months. Welcome to our live blog coverage of renewed activity on Capitol Hill to end the government shutdown and lift the debt ceiling. They seem serious this time. A meeting Thursday afternoon between House Republican leaders and the president produced late-night talks on what could be a broad deal. Big budget questions appeared to be on the table, in addition to the two emergencies. A pair of influential House Republicans, the chairmen of the appropriations and budget committees, said publicly that the talks had legs. The White House said the president \"looks forward to making continued progress.\" Shelved was the Republican \"offer\" of Thursday morning to temporarily raise the debt limit. Gone was the notion that the Tea Party would redouble its fight to cripple Obamacare. House Republicans left a Friday breakfast talking about passing a stopgap spending bill to reopen the government, according to Robert Costa of the National Review. That step previously seemed beyond reach because of the strength of hard-right resistance. Coincidentally, NBC News and the Wall Street Journal released one of their regular polls Thursday evening showing that the Republican party had, through the shutdown and default brinksmanship, achieved its worst rating in the history of the poll: 24% positive, 53% negative. The poll said the public blames Republicans more than the president for the shutdown by a margin of 53-31. The poll showed that Obamacare is rising in popularity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
