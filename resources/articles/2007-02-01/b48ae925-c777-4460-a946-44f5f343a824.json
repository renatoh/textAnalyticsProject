The supply teacher has written me a note saying you all claimed yesterday that you had finished your coursework.\" I'd been absent, visiting another school as part of my Teach First training. \"What was it like, Miss?\" \"Well, it was ... very different. Do you know, I saw girls arriving early to class and apologising for their lateness?\" There are roars of \"No!\" \"And what's more,\" I add, \"every single student thanked their teacher at the end of the lesson.\" \"Miss, that is extra.\" At 7.30 the previous morning, I had headed west on a train out of London to one of the UK's top girls' schools, Wycombe Abbey. By morning break, I felt quite stunned - in the two previous lessons, I'd heard teachers caution their students against working too hard. \"Stick to the 55-minute prep time,\" the 13-year-olds were told. \"Don't spend more time than that.\" In the classes I observed there were no gimmicks, no lesson starters to catch their attention, just settled listeners, a little performance of snatches from Shakespeare's plays, and minds carefully working through the text before them. I had the sense that enjoyment of the text was excitement enough. Some of my own classes, on the other hand, had been passed on to me in boxes marked \"highly flammable\". My year 11s are like fireworks: full of energy, light and noise, usually set off by each other, but sometimes by poetry and by my questions to them. There is a fine balance, which I haven't yet found, between igniting excitement and discussion, and controlling the sparks that fly off in all directions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
