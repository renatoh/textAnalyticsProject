He was a crusader like few others have been for human rights causes, a purist as it were when it came to agitating for the political prisoner, or those raped and pillaged in conflicts, or women and homosexuals discriminated, harassed or even killed for no crimes of their own doing in other societies. He believed in freedom for all, worked hard to raise awareness about genocide in Darfur and elsewhere and was a friend to nearly all who were the victims of thuggishness and repression - whether it was state-based or transnational. Lantos had flaws too. He tended to look at the Arab Muslim world through the lens of Israel. As the only Holocaust survivor serving in Congress, this is not all that surprising. What few people know is that he clearly shifted in recent years to being a strong advocate of a credible US-led Palestinian-Israeli peace process. He believed that America needed to bolster its diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and stop responding militarily to all of our problems there. Despite some strident members of Congress trying to frame Iran's nuclear pretensions as something that needed a US military response sooner rather than later, Lantos was a critic of the building passion for a military strike and sternly called for the Bush administration and the legislative branch to get serious about diplomatic approaches with traction. In a discussion I once enjoyed with him, I recounted a Brookings speech that senator Chuck Hagel had given about the folly of \"false choices\" in the Middle East - and that America could not afford to choose Israel's interests at the expense of Arab interests, or the other way around. We needed to develop an interest-based foreign policy, according to Hagel, that built in both of these parties and that helped them go further than their current circumstances would allow them to do on their own. Lantos grabbed my arm and said: Chuck Hagel is on exactly the right course. I loved bumping into the dapper Lantos at parties around Washington. He was always at the best parties with his wife - and they loved sampling the food, the wine and skimming the surface of the social scene in one grand venue before jumping to the next. He was one of Washington's big personalities, and he tended to have either his chief of staff Bob King or Bob's wife and Lantos's foreign policy advisor Kay King near at hand smoothing the way, though I have to say Lantos had no problem with slickness. I saw him so frequently at these receptions for a time that I decided to use each opportunity to push him on America's role in the Middle East and on the subject of Israel-Palestine negotiations - which my colleague Daniel Levy had made me one of his close collaborators. Lantos could marshal up the images of the miserable plight of women in Muslim societies, or comment on the terror techniques deployed by Hamas and Hezbollah in firing rockets into Israel or in sending people to their deaths as suicide bombers. But over the last year, particularly after the Lebanon-Israel war, Lantos shifted. He began to speak more frequently about the plight of the Palestinians both as refugees in other Arab states and within Israel and the occupied territories - and knew that the methodologies of engagement he often called for in relieving stress and hardship for other beleaguered people was not being done for Palestinians. And to my surprise and delight, Lantos shifted into an earnest supporter of credible deal-making between Israel and Palestine, though I think he knew that the course was as problem-pocked as most other analysts who have a cynical view of the chances of achieving anything real this year. On one occasion, I spent quite a bit of time discussing Middle East peace prospects with Lantos at a reception in honour of the outgoing Saudi Ambassador to the US, Prince Turki al-Faisal. Prince Turki is a \"big personality\" in the Middle East, someone who ran the Saudi intelligence machinery for a couple of decades and would be a great model for a future John LeCarre novel. Turki, in my view, is one of the most agile diplomatic forces in the Middle East today trying genuinely behind the scenes to cobble together an equilibrium of interests among the contending Palestinian factions, other Arab states, Israel, the US and Europe. Turki is not a \"peacenik\". Neither am I. But I thought that as the chair of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, Lantos would be a devoted peacenik -- someone who could not entertain the notion of \"stable equilibriums\" among some often nefarious characters as an alternative to peace. But in my own conversations with Lantos and my not-too-obvious eavesdropping on Lantos's conversation with the outgoing Prince Turki, I realised that Lantos was more flexible than I thought, more willing to entertain approaches to Middle East peace that were not built upon false choices between Israeli and Arab interests. I had a bond with Lantos I haven't told many people about. In November 1996, in Bonn, Germany, I was struck about 24 times in the head by three thugs with baseball bat-like, thick, wooden dowels. I spent a week in the hospital in Bonn followed by a long recovery in the US. I was over there on my first trip to Germany, and this incident -- which I believe was a hate crime, not a mugging or robbery - happened within my first six hours of arrival. My saviours on that trip were co-congressional staff trip members Bob and Kay King, two of the people that most helped run the Lantos Human Rights political machinery. I owe them much - and without compromising the Kings too much or overly gushing to them about how they helped buoy me emotionally, I did tell Lantos about their role in my own brush with hate. I think that this confession of my own to him somehow made him listen to my own impression that America was increasingly seen by other countries as a nation that could not achieve its objectives - and that this would undermine us in many arenas, not just in the Arab Muslim world. I remember trying to convince him that the failures that Israel, Palestine, the US and the rest of the Middle East endured every time final status peace negotiations collapsed were more and more costly to American prestige and to global stability. I think he got that in the end. Regrettably, Lantos - a real hero for so many different human rights causes - was not able during his final term to apply the considerable leverage he had in helping to end one of the world's most important human rights messes in the Middle East. But in my view, it's important that his successors and colleagues know that he was an advocate of a credible deal and communicated this to many - not just to Prince Turki and me, but in his commentary in Foreign Relations committee hearings and elsewhere. Like Ariel Sharon and others, he knew that the Israeli-Palestinian situation was unsustainable and that a change in approach was needed. We should now work hard to fill in the pieces that Tom Lantos was unable to do before he passed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
