Yesterday it asked whether it might be ethical to pay people for their body parts. After all, it argues in its consultative paper, it is considered reasonable to pay people \"compensation\" for taking part in drug trials, or to offer women who donate some of their eggs thousands of pounds of fertility treatment. Yet the reward for a pint of blood is a cup of tea \u2013 and for a kidney, or part of a kidney, it is nothing at all. Why is financial compensation acceptable for some transactions and not others, and why do the courts effectively concede that it is all right to go abroad to find a surrogate mother in a country where it is legal to pay for the service, or to go for a transplant to India, where organs are more readily available because donors can sell them. Why, the council wonders, do we treat babies differently from kidneys? Why distinguish between creating, enhancing and prolonging life? This is not just an interesting ethical question. The council's motive is to try to establish whether our muddled ethics are one of the explanations for Britain's poor rate of organ transplant, among the worst in the developed world. A vigorous Department of Health campaign has nearly doubled the number of registered donors, but less than a third of British adults are signed up. And although nine out of 10 people support the idea in theory, 40% of families withhold consent at the point where it actually arises. One of the issues the council will examine is consent. To be valid in law, consent must be informed and voluntary. If reward is involved, how far can it remain voluntary? And what does that mean for the controversial possibility \u2013 favoured by the recently retired chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson as well as Gordon Brown \u2013 of presumed consent: a system of opting out rather than opting in. Examining the ethics of transplants may help resolve the controversy around it. Solidarity, reciprocity and justice might all be justifications for what is currently a deeply divisive issue. But establishing what is ethically correct will not necessarily persuade people to accept it. At the moment organ transplant is mired in suspicion of government-held records and the health department's laggardly approach to its own transplant taskforce's recommendations for tackling structural difficulties like the shortage of intensive care beds, transplant teams and donor champions \u2013 proposals that the taskforce believed could increase the number of operations by a half within five years. The only pressing ethical issue it identified was a fear of a conflict of interest when establishing a potential donor's point of death. The ethics are confused, but clarity alone will not be enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
