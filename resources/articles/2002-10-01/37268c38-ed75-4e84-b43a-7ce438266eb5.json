Fathomless puddles gathered on the cracked concrete around the stadium. As raised metal batons glinted under the floodlights, tides of humanity eddied back and forth in an angry panic. From the home supporters, the uhhh-uhhh-uhhh of monkey chants greeted the visiting team's handful of black players. In a nearby hospital, gunshot wounds were being treated. Saturday evening in Bratislava was a very long way indeed from all those sunlit pleasure domes in Japan with their rows of smiling fans. A long way, too, from cocktails at No10. When he arrived at the Tehelne Pole stadium for a training session at the end of last week, and saw the dilapidated stands crowded against a pitch whose drainage system could not cope with the incessant rain, Sven-Goran Eriksson was reminded of the old English league grounds to which he paid many visits during his early years in football. An altogether harsher environment, it bred a different kind of English footballer. And for the first 45 minutes on Saturday, the present crop showed their unfamiliarity with conditions in which earlier generations would have been thoroughly at home. The Beckhams, Owens and Gerrards, their investment potential spotted in childhood, grew up in academies providing pitches so carefully laid and tended that you could play lawn bowls on them. The old rice-paddies of the past are a foreign country, and on Saturday it was a good job they had a wise guide. Eriksson identified the crux of the problem and used the half-time break to put it right. He rearranged the midfield, told the players to use more patience, and sent them out to win the match. In other words, he did all the things he was accused of not doing in the World Cup quarter-final against Brazil. But in another sense the coach, too, was in an unfamiliar environment. \"Football-wise I've had many tough weeks during the last 20 years, and many good weeks as well,\" he said afterwards. \"But my private life has never been exposed like this. And it has been going on for months.\" This was a grubby weekend in every respect except Saturday night's final score. Grubby weather, a grubby environment, grubby behaviour from both sets of fans and from Bratislava's police and security guards, and grubby treatment of Eriksson, who endured the pre-match inquisitions about the likely impact of Ulrika Jonsson's imminent revelations with quiet dignity and not a shred of false bravado. Was it Jonsson who could be said to be exercising the harlot's timeless prerogative, or the editor of the Daily Mail? For 45 minutes it looked as if both of them would get a result. Had the match continued as it began, with a clueless England going a goal down to Slovakia, things would look very different this morning. Notably, as he implied, to Eriksson himself. \"I want to win football games and I want to reach Portugal in 2004,\" he said on Saturday night, \"but it's very important for me not to get that mixed up with my private life. One thing is one thing, the other is another.\" And he repeated the suggestion he had made the previous day, that he would remain the master of his own destiny. \"As long as I cope with it, it's OK. Until I wake up one morning and say, 'Enough is enough.' \" That morning might have come yesterday. As it turned out, his coaching instincts and the way the players reacted to his half-time instructions were enough to delay the onset of a terminal weariness with the bogus moral outrage of the Daily Mail's squadron of Little Englanders. In other words, he justified his reputation. He did his job, with the help of his squad. Should he have shouted at them, in a display of the passion that he was accused of lacking in Shizuoka? \"When people try, you shouldn't be angry. If people aren't trying, or don't do the best they can, then I get angry. But I think they tried in the first half. We did very well in the second half. It showed a lot of character.\" His players could not help noticing the way that non-football issues were being used to put the coach under additional pressure. \"We were conscious of the way a lot of things have been angled,\" Gareth Southgate said, \"and we're delighted for him that we got the result. There's no doubt about that.\" \"It's not about me,\" Eriksson protested gently when he was asked if the players had wanted to win it for him. \"I hope the feeling is very good, but they just wanted to win. We talked at half-time. I said, 'We can win and we have to win. Try to play a little bit in another way.' They came out and from the first minute of the second half it was another music.\" Almost everything about the trip to Bratislava was like a nightmare journey back into the past. Now that Arsenal are in the habit of starting matches with nine black outfield players, England's grounds are more or less free from demonstrations of racial hatred. But like Italy, where Eriksson once had to cope with the notorious Lazio fans, Slovakia still has some ground to make up. \"I always think they are a few,\" the coach said of those who insulted Emile Heskey, Ashley Cole and Kieron Dyer. \"I don't think there were 23,000 people doing that. But you have to do something about it. It's crazy to boo people of another colour.\" The sight of fans and police confronting each other on the terraces reminded him of his presence in the Heysel Stadium on that terrible night in 1985 when English fans chose the European Cup final as the stage for a tragedy. \"It's the most beautiful game,\" Eriksson said. \"It should be a party every time. There should be a rivalry between the fans, but in a sporting way.\" In the end, inevitably, the discussions of the evening's events returned to the issue that had all but obliterated the existence of a football match. Did he think that Saturday's victory had put an end to the distraction of outside issues? \"I should like to think so,\" he replied. \"But I think that's a question I have to put to you.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
