Her 6-2, 6-3 victory over Mara Santangelo, a top-30 Italian, in the International Championship was dashing and assured, conveying an impression that her 2006 debacle here against Nathalie Dechy had been due as much to the wind whipping across the English channel as to the mental storms to which she is sometimes subject. \"It took me a long time to feel comfortable with this [the grass surface],\" Mauresmo said. \"But after reaching my first semi-final at Wimbledon I started to see how I could play and come in and make other girls have to make passes or winners every time.\" Santangelo could not manage that, and it will be fascinating to see whether Justine Henin and others can do so against a champion who seems much more relaxed about it all than she has ever been. \"When you have good feelings in places, you want to find them again but it doesn't mean that everything will happen just the same,\" she said. \"You still have that white page that you have to write the history on.\" Mauresmo added that she felt confident because she had surrounded herself with nice things, but after the 25-year-old Henin's recent rapprochement with her family after a gap of eight years, this may begin to describe the French Open champion, too. As for Henin, she said of playing on grass: \"I didn't trust myself compared with clay.\" Even so she still notched up a 6-4, 6-1 win over Agnieszka Radwanska that was as impressive as Mauresmo's. She hit with topspin angles from the baseline, contained and approached with slice, volleyed plenty and showed once again that her range of options is greater than anyone's - and yet still was not completely satisfied. \"In my practice I was a little nervous because of the conditions,\" she said. \"Then the weather improved and I was all right. But I need to come to the net more than that. Obviously I'm not used to it again yet. It will take a few more days. My legs hurt because of running on the grass, I wasn't aggressive enough but I'm happy. I'm moving well and the rest will come.\" She seemed to be worrying unnecessarily. But then, worry has become part of her existence in the past six months. \"At the start of the year I was not a tennis player,\" she said earlier this week, referring to her debilitating marital break-up. \"I was just a woman.\" Right now she looks very much a tennis player, and a great one, again. Later all three of Britain's second-round survivors went out, although Katie O'Brien can take heart from her stubborn effort against Elena Dementieva, twice a grand slam finalist. The Yorkshire 21-year-old was a break up at 3-1 in the first set, and a break up again at 4-3 in the second. Both times she became marginally over-ambitious and at the end she was betrayed by double faults. \"But it has been the first week when I have felt I could live with these players,\" she said. It would be nice timing for next week to become the second. Elena Baltacha's run was ended by the Czech teenager Nicole Vaidisova who delivered a 6-3, 6-2 mauling in an hour. \"It was mostly just a case of pure talent from her, although I never really got to the pace of the match,\" said Baltacha. \"She just kept hitting winners and when you get to the top level you can go on and on because you are playing top-quality opposition week after week. \"I've shown here how much I have improved but I also know how much there is still to do. There is Wimbledon next week and it all depends on the draw there, but what it is all about really for me is staying healthy and getting better and better for the rest of the year. The Brits have done well at Eastbourne and I'm proud to be part of that. If I had been told two weeks ago I would get to this stage through qualifying I would not have believed it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
