Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver that involves the formation of fibrous tissue associated with the destruction of the normal state of the organ. Prevalence According to the Department of Health (DoH), the number of deaths from liver disease, including cirrhosis, rose from 2,801 in 1998 to 4,718 in 1999 - a 68% increase. Half of all cases are due to long-standing alcohol abuse. Symptoms The symptoms depend on the extent of damage to the liver. Initially patients may experience tiredness, weakness, nausea and weight loss. In the later stages they may suffer jaundice (yellowing of the skin), fluid retention (in the legs or abdomen), abnormal blood vessels (red face), easy bruising (and nosebleeds) and enlargement of the breasts in men. Complications can include liver cancer, impotence and blood poisoning. Treatment The damage to the liver cannot be repaired but symptoms can be relieved and complications reduced - for example, with drugs to reduce the risk of bleeding from abnormal blood vessels. Transplantation may be considered in patients with end-stage cirrhosis. Outlook Only 30% of people with this condition live more than five years after diagnosis and the outlook is worse if the cause is alcohol and the patient continues to drink. About 10% develop liver cancer, which is fatal within a few months. Pancreatitis What is it? Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas - a gland that produces insulin - needed to control blood sugar levels, and enzymes needed for digestion of food. Prevalence About 350 people die each year form alcohol-related pancreatitis. It is predominantly a problem in heavy drinking young men. Symptoms The symptoms are attacks of extreme pain with vomiting, often triggered by a bout of heavy drinking. These may last for hours or even days. About half of sufferers also go on to develop diabetes. Treatment Patients must avoid alcohol. Mild pain can be treated with paracetomol, while more severe attacks can be relieved with morphine. In rare cases surgery may be considered for patients with chronic pancreatitis, which involves partial or complete removal of the pancreas. Outlook Nearly one in 10 cases of acute pancreatitis is fatal and survivors may still suffer severe pain even if they abstain from alcohol. Only half of patients with chronic pancreatitis survive for longer than seven years following diagnosis. Depression What is it? Depression covers a wide range of psychological distress, from lowered mood at its mildest form to losing the will to live at its most severe. Some people with depression use alcohol as a form of self-medication, to try to cheer themselves up, or to help them sleep. However, alcohol in large quantities produces a depressant effect on people's mood. Prevalence Up to 40% of people who drink heavily have symptoms of a depressive illness. According to the DoH, there were 78,900 NHS hospital admissions with a diagnosis of mental and behavioural disorder due to alcohol in 1998-99. Another survey in 2001 found 40% of suicides in England and Wales who contacted mental health services in the year before their deaths had a history of alcohol misuse. This figure rose to 53% in Scotland and 62% in Northern Ireland. Symptoms The symptoms of depression include losing interest in normal activities, hobbies and everyday life, difficulty sleeping, poor appetite, weight loss, low sex drive, poor concentration. Feeling tired, tense, irritable, anxious, inadequate and hopeless. Treatment Patients are usually required to reduce their alcohol consumption first. Then they are often prescribed one of the new generation of antidepressants known as serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), such as Prozac, and usually have to undergo counselling. Continued heavy drinking risks suffering greater side-effects from antidepressants. Outlook If untreated, depression can lead to thoughts of suicide. The lack of self-control, compromised judgment and impulsiveness from the alcohol misuse can increase the chances of someone attempting suicide. Heart conditions Heavy drinking - particularly binge drinking - is a common cause of high blood pressure (hypertension). People with high blood pressure face increased risk of coronary heart disease (eg heart attack) and stroke. Binge drinking can cause irregular heartbeats, palpitations and, rarely, sudden death. However, moderate alcohol consumption (one or two drinks per day) is linked with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. Prevalence Heart and circulatory disease is the UK's biggest killer, with 140,599 deaths in 1997 (office for national statistics). There are about 100 deaths each year due to alcoholic cardiomyopathy - a chronic disease of the heart muscle. It is found in people who have been regularly drinking 10 or more units a day for 10 years or more. Regularly drinking more than three units a day increases the risk of one of the less common type of stroke (haemorrhagic stroke). Treatment Patients are also encouraged to adopt a healthier lifestyle, including moderating their alcohol consumption, eating a healthy diet, stopping smoking and taking regular exercise. Those who suffer heart attacks are always prescribed asprin, and other medication to lower their blood pressure and cholesterol. Surgical interventions include coronary bypass, angioplasties - and heart transplantation when damage is irreparable. Symptoms Symptoms of heart attack include sudden chest pain, possibly radiating to the left arm, hands, jaw, ear, stomach or the right arm; severe and spontaneous breathing difficulties; sudden fainting or severe dizziness. Outlook Failure to adopt a healthy lifestyle can increase the risk of heart attacks and heart failure. After a heart attack, loss of physical ability will be in proportion to the extent of damage to the heart. There is also an increased risk of depression, which in turn can increase the risk of alcohol misuse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
