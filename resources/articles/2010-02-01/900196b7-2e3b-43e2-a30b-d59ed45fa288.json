This performance was as stuttering and unconvincing as a Tiger Woods apology but, against another of the sides battling for survival, the victory it brought will taste sweet all the same. For Hull, however, there can be no consolation. The visitors started dismally and got progressively worse; they were poor with 11 men, terrible with 10 and hopeless with nine. The Hammers will scarcely have a better opportunity to impress. Up by a goal or more for almost the entire game, and by a man or more for nearly half of it, they still failed to relax. Carlton Cole's goal, their second, came from what was by some distance the best move of the match, even if it consisted of just a single pass \u2013 Julien Faubert's superbly weighted through-ball \u2013 and a smart, clipped finish. People will talk too of a 70th-minute shot from inside his own half by Alessandro Diamanti that drew a save from Boaz Myhill, though it seemed to be dropping wide of goal. If the home side were little more than adequate, their opponents were considerably less. With only one win in the last 13 league matches, Hull must have been short of confidence even before the ghastly early opening goal. Tom Cairney lost possession to Valon Behrami, who passed to Guillermo Franco. The Mexican, making his first appearance of 2010, tried to control the ball and failed so badly that it rolled back into the path of Behrami, who scored with ease from 15 yards. \"What we did in the first few minutes was inexplicable and inexcusable as well,\" said Phil Brown. \"Myhill rolls the ball to Dawson, who gives it to a young pup in midfield and the ball ends up in the back of the net. If I was telling you that's the way I wanted them to play, it would be my fault. But it certainly wasn't the way I wanted them to play. I've said the words 'self-inflicted' so many times already this season. You work so hard all week on your game plan, then you're 1-0 down in two-and-a-half minutes and you've got a mountain to climb.\" Behrami, having scored his first goal of the season, could have had a hat-trick by half-time only for Myhill to deny him twice. At the other end, Robert Green parried George Boateng's powerful shot in the 45th minute. \"We steadied the ship, to a certain extent,\" said Brown. \"Then more self-inflicted damage.\" Seven minutes into the second half Craig Fagan, already booked for a foul on Scott Parker, gently tugged at Diamanti's shirt, the Italian tumbled theatrically and Hull were down to 10 men. After Cole extended West Ham's lead an increasingly desperate Brown made a triple substitution \u2013 \"players who can add a bit of fight, a bit of spunk to the performance\", as he put it. One of them, Jozy Altidore, missed a decent chance but when Anthony Gardner fell awkwardly in the 81st minute they had no further options. He was carried off, left leg heavily strapped, and Hull were down to nine. Their numerical disadvantage might explain the third goal, when Faubert collected Radoslav Kovac's pass in stoppage time, ran into the area without the merest hint of a challenge and thumped a shot into the top-left corner. The Hammers' home record is looking increasingly impressive: five games unbeaten, four successive clean sheets, consecutive wins. The pity is that three of their next four fixtures are away, at Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal. \"This is a team that when it plays with confidence can be a surprise, so who knows?\" said Gianfranco Zola. Nobody knows. But they can have a decent guess. THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Luke Madden, Observer reader This was a must-win game for us and although we weren't brilliant we did enough to deserve the points. The early goal was the perfect start, but we didn't build on it. Hull had little to offer in attack but it was a relief when Cole got the second. Our best player was Diamanti. He was the difference between the sides, because he has something extra to offer. He hasn't got the pace, but he has the quality - he even tried a shot from his own half. Faubert was impressive, too. He's settling down now as a defender. We've been looking over our shoulders all season, hopefully we can soothe the nerves by building on this result and get out of trouble. The fan's player ratings Green 6; Faubert 7, Tomkins 7, Upson 7, Spector 7; Behrami 7, Kovac 6, Parker 7, Diamanti 8 (Collison 85); Franco 6 (Ilan 63 6), Cole 7 (Mido 79 6) Rick Skelton, HullCityOnline.com This was another bad away day. It started poorly when we conceded the early goal and got worse when Fagan was sent off for a needless shirt pull on Diamanti. They scored the second not long afterwards and we were left waiting for the third to go in. Myhill kept us in it in the first half and we were on top for the first 20 minutes of the second with Green having to make some great saves. A couple of weeks ago we were feeling pretty good, but that optimism has evaporated. Bullard is badly missed and the sooner he's back the better. I still think there are three teams worse than us, but we have to prove it.
