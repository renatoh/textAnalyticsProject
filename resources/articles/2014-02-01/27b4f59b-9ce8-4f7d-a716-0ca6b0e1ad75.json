Mourinho remains unhappy at the Frenchman's claim last week that the Chelsea manager was playing down his side's championship hopes because he was scared to fail. While Wenger was careful to speak about Arsenal's general title rivals, Mourinho remains clear that he was being spoken about. The Portuguese claims Wenger's comments were unprovoked. \"The only thing I feel is that I was very quiet, in my place, and somebody spoke not in a nice way about us,\" he said. \"After that I don't accept that one is always Monsieur Polite and the other one is always the bad guy. I don't accept, I'm sorry.\" Chelsea were beaten 2-0 by Manchester City on Saturday to be knocked out of the FA Cup. Mourinho believes the referee, Phil Dowd, did not do his job correctly, with the manager claiming the official bowed to pressure from City players. \"We could speak about the referee's team that in the previous game they were perfect and [for City] Phil, when they put pressure on him, they couldn't cope and they change completely in the second half,\" Mourinho said. \"We could speak about lots of things but let's be pragmatic and simple and say the best team won.\" The Portuguese did point to City being more rested than his side. Manuel Pellegrini's team had not played in midweek due to their match with Sunderland being called off because of inclement weather. Mourinho said: \"We couldn't be at our maximum level. We could speak about how they didn't play in midweek, we could speak about how John Terry did not play, but I don't like to speak about injured players.\" City's win means they continue to pursue an unprecedented quadruple. Yet Mourinho claimed that the extra games City have to play could actually be an advantage to them. \"That's not a problem. What affects the Premier League is the change of the fixtures. They have to play later when they play after the other teams fighting for the title, it is easier. They know somebody lost, somebody won, they lost two points, one point is enough for us. That is obviously an advantage. But it's not their fault. It's the weather, the fixtures, the FA, the Premier League, so it's not their fault,\" he said. Pressed if Chelsea could use this to their advantage by winning thier games before City play, Mourinho said: \"Leave us in peace. It's not for us. We have to try to win the next game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
