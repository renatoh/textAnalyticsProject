He did not write his successful first book, The Naked Face, until he was 51 - 20 years after he won an Oscar for best original screenplay for The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer. He had six plays produced on Broadway, with three running simultaneously at one point, and in 1970, when the first book came out, one of his three successful television series was screening weekly in the United States. Sheldon was in the Guinness Book of World Records for the greatest number of languages into which his novels were translated, and more than 300m copies were printed. He was also the only writer ever to win both an Oscar, for The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer in 1947 starring Cary Grant, Shirley Temple and Rudy Vallee, a Tony for one of his Broadway productions, The Redhead, in 1959, and an Edgar Allan Poe award for mystery writing, for The Naked Face. Seventeen other novels followed; all made the New York Times fiction bestseller list, many at the number one slot. The first to do so was Sheldon's second book, The Other Side of Midnight (1974). Other titles included Bloodline (1977), If Tomorrow Comes (1986), The Sands of Time (1988), Nothing Lasts Forever (1994), The Sky Is Falling (2000) and Are You Afraid of the Dark?, which appeared in 2004 when its author was approaching 88. Many of these fast and furious tales, usually featuring gutsy women in danger or in love, were ignored by the critics but adored by the readers. Sheldon's own lavish lifestyle provided him with many scenes and descriptions that fascinated rich and poor - \"Fergie is a fan,\" he disclosed after meeting the former wife of Prince Andrew at dinner in Palm Springs, California, where he had a five-house complex. His successes brought immense wealth. He travelled luxuriously to more than 90 countries, bought and sold Andrew Lloyd Webber's London house and worked from a magnificent hilltop mansion off Sunset Boulevard, amid three acres of land, with 11 bedrooms, 22 bathrooms and a French chef. He played no tennis or golf, but worked nine-hour days dictating his books to a stenographer and then extensively editing the typed manuscripts. Despite his age, Sheldon's publishers testified to his modernity - although only in his 18th work, Are You Afraid of the Dark (2004) did he discover the advantages of the computer. \"I hadn't used one for research before,\" he said, \"but I was amazed by the software that made an encyclopaedia practically obsolete.\" In that novel, he included some of his high-tech discoveries. At that time, he was also working on an autobiography that, uncharacterisically, had occupied him for several years. A memoir, The Other Side of Me, was published in 2005. Meanwhile, he swapped the mansion for another at the beach because his second wife, Alexandra, disliked Los Angeles smog. (His first wife, actor Jorja Curtright, died in 1985.) Always a workaholic, Sheldon liked to tell a story from an earlier time, when his Los Angeles home had been threatened by fire. Police ordered him and his wife to flee, but after she had taken her valuables he grabbed only his yellow writing pads and pencils. \"I realised we might be trapped in a hotel for several days and I wanted to be able to work,\" he recalled. Sheldon was born to middle-class parents in Chicago, who worked at the family-owned chemist's shop, where he joined them as a messenger boy. An unhappy 17-year old, he thought of suicide and suffered from depression, which was not diagnosed for many years. Only after a miserable Oscar night in 1947 did a psychiatrist finally identify the condition. The first example happened after his suicide thoughts at 17. Once, as a young man, having sold a lyric to a local band- leader, he headed for New York, where a famous popular composer liked his work and offered him an appointment the next day. But Sheldon panicked and was on the next bus back to Chicago. He then spent time at Northwestern University, but did not graduate. Instead, he went to Hollywood and became a $17-a-week script reader, but soon offered his own work (he had made his first sale, at 10, when he was paid $10 for a poem). His first Hollywood sale was for a screenplay called South of Panama, for which he was paid $250. By 1941, after brief military service as a pilot in the US army air corps, he had written four B-movies that played that year; 25 screenplays followed until 1965. His two most famous were the musicals Easter Parade (1948), with Judy Garland and Fred Astaire, and his adaptation of Annie Get Your Gun, the 1950 musical. Another adaptation was from Cole Porter's Anything Goes in 1956. Sheldon's TV successes were the Patty Duke Show (1963-66), I Dream of Jeannie (1965-70), which featured an astronaut, played by Larry Hagman, who lands on a desert island and discovers a bottle containing a genie (Barbara Eden), and Hart to Hart (1979-84). In all, he calculated, he wrote more than 250 television scripts. His Broadway plays are mostly forgotten, but the first, The Merry Widow, was produced in 1943 when he was only 26. Others were Jackpot (1944), Dream With Music (1944), Redhead, Roman Candle (1960) and Gomes, produced in London in 1973. Sheldon is survived by Alexandra, and by Mary, the daughter of his first marriage. \u00b7 Sidney Sheldon, novelist, playwright, screenwriter and director, born February 11 1917; died January 30 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
